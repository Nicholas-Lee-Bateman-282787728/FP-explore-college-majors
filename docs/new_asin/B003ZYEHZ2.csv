4237127,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"I approached this film half expecting a cash-in, as Bill Hicks' legacy seems to have become a lucrative commodity for some (e.g. 2003's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shock-Awe/dp/B000096FOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shock & Awe</a>).

Happily, this is not the case & the film seems to be both a genuine and sincere homage to the man himself, but also a real attempt to bring something fresh & unseen to fan-boys (such as myself).

The plot is fairly simple - it starts off with his early years and ends with his death from cancer. In the process, they place each of the DVD's and CD's in context & show lots of interview clips of fellow comedians, friends & family.

So far, so predictable.

The great thing about this film though is that they have included many, many pieces of unseen footage & have strived to put him in the context of fellow comedians (all of whom are excellent - e.g. Jimmy Pineapple (esp the 'I am 'it'' routine))

The most original contribution that the film maker's have made is to take all the 100's of photos of Bill & turned them into action-stills. A lot of the material by the man is the same, but he always had a gift of being photogenic and hence this factor symbolises the director's efforts to bring something new to the table.

By no means is this film perfect & I have heard some people say 'It's not that good', but not from anyone who's actually seen it.
One thing I can pick out is that there is nothing about his relationships or Girlfriends that were so formative to much of his comedy (e.g. his Fiance Colleen McGarr).
There is also the fact that the film ends with the 'It's Just a Ride' scene, which is fast becoming cliche (e.g.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zeitgeist/dp/3940845647/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zeitgeist</a>).
(Oh, and there is a bit at the end of the film which grates a little, where the screen says something to the effect of 'The Hicks family continue to live in ... and are all remarkably intelligent'. Although they may be, this seems a little bit of an affectation towards them...)*

Besides this, there was too much to like about this film (plus I am totally biased - see profile). It was really interesting to find out how Mr Hicks used to take mushrooms on a ranch with friends & about his final cancer-ridden days.
There is also an amazing moment in the middle of the film, where one of the commentators says something to the effect that ""Great Stand-up comedy is where the inner voice matches the outer one"" & Bill seems transformed thereafter into Prophet more than Comedian (rather like the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B000056WOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>).

A word or two about the extras. When I initially wrote this review (based on just the film), I speculated that it may ""include full extras of his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rant-in-E-Minor/dp/B0000009QI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rant in E-Minor</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arizona-Bay/dp/B0000009QH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arizona Bay</a>&nbsp;routines"". At the time of writing, I was not aware that the Estate were planning to release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Essential-Collection-2CD-2DVD/dp/B003WR9N6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Essential Collection (2CD+2DVD)</a>&nbsp;(which includes the routines that were the raw material for both those albums, among other routines).

As a result, this DVD does not contain those routines but instead has a total of 5 hours of material, such as footage of his lesser seen performances and (best of all) 3 hours of Extended interviews.

Not only are these interviews edited and sorted into stages (with people like Kevin Booth, Dwight Slade, Jimmy Pineapple & his remaining family commenting on each part), but they are also SO different to the film that they almost make a whole new film!

All manner of richly interesting material (and not just leftovers) makes it in (including intriguing gambits such as how his final words 'I left in Love, Laughter & Truth' were in fact inspired by one of Hicks' favorite books -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grapes-of-Wrath/dp/0141185066/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grapes of Wrath</a>).
And there are are also a myriad of other details including a really eerie piece of 'synchrony' about his time of death (9:20pm EST), stories about his meeting Richard Pryor & Robin Williams AND the truth about what happened with his Dad & the Magic Mushrooms.

Truly, it is worth getting both DVD's, just to see both halves of the interviews.

On top of the interviews, there is 2 hours of other material; the best bits being the rare clips (including some clips from 'The Outlaws get Religion'), the 'Comedy school' (with Jimmy Pineapple & Dwight Slade, about what stand-up is like & how Bill got as good as he did) and also some material with Kevin Booth about the making of 'Arizona Bay' & the Ranch they took mushrooms on.

As a general rule, the best stuff is the interviews with people who knew Bill (especially his aforementioned friends, but also his photographer David Johndrow and his brother Steve Hicks). The unreleased material is worth seeing, although most of the making-of stuff, trailers etc are fairly standard.

Although some of the later extras go overboard on detail (it took me a week of evening viewings to get through the film & all the extras), the special features do stay within the bounds of the subject and it's clear that the film-makers have gone to great pains not to duplicate material between here & the other releases.

***

So, overall, this DVD is well worth getting. If you know nothing about the man, then this is a good place to start, as the film includes snippets of all his material & many of his best routines are peppered throughout the film.
If you're a geeky fan-boy on the other hand, then this film is also great as it fills in the gaps of his story (including the formative influence of alcohol on him) and also provides a host of unseen material.

It is my fervent hope that Bill would go onto influence many others to speak out against hypocrisy. If the evidence of George W Bush is anything to go by, America (and the World) could really do with knowing more about Bill Hicks.

Here's hoping they move onto&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Carlin/dp/B0037B2WL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Carlin</a>&nbsp;next...

* = Though the line about the Hicks family being 'remarkably intelligent' was on the cinematic version, it has been removed from the DVD and replaced with 'the Hicks family continue to protect Bill's Legacy'.

It is an outstanding documentary, and it deserves to win all sorts of awards.  And for true fans who think they have all the CDs and videos, you'll find enough new material to satisfy you as well.

Very well put together as you get a chronological order of the events that took place on his rise to stardom. Included some early life and behind the scene details of Hicks' trials and tribulations. I thought the beginning of the film was a little slow but things quickly picked up as Hick's career started to bloom. Production did a good job including many of Bill's early and late footage of his shows. Fan or not, I think no one will be disappointed watching this film. Its unfortunate that we do not have enough people like Bill Hicks to invoke thought as well as put a comical light on issues that may normally bring about negative feelings.

This is NOT region-locked. It WILL play in America, but there's an almost Faustian hitch: You have to watch it on the Blu-Ray drive on a Sony Vaio computer.

Playstation 3, the way many Americans view Blu-Ray movies, will only take you directly to the main menu. That is all you will ever see. We tested this on multiple consoles, but none were the Slim version.

So, it works, but just barely. I contacted Sony, the very company that invented this technology, and they were perplexed.

This is supposed to be released in America sooner or later, but the release date hasn't been announced. So, if you must watch this, buy this with the above advice.

It is no surprise that this is a UK import - they appreciated him more over there then they ever did here. Jolly good! I doubt this will ever get a stateside NTSC release. If you have a way to play PAL DVDs, then this is manna from heaven for any Bill Hicks fan. Kudos to the film makers for this awesome tribute to Mr. William Melvin Hicks!

It's compelling and riveting.  I really love all the great stories Bill's friends shared.  Dwight, Kevin, and John each contributed wonderful anecdotes which still make me laugh. Bill had such an amazing group of friends.  I'm so thankful they were included in this project.
Bill's family his mother and brother also contributed some great stories.  Overall you can really appreciate what Bill did and what he meant to those closest to him.  I did not see him when he was alive, and I still regret that. I only wish someone had turned me onto him when he was performing.
Bill had a unique and penetrating wit.  He made valid scathing comments about life and our world. Yet he did it all with a fabulous style
and charm.  He cannot be replaced, and he continues to be missed. His fan base will keep growing since he is still relevant despite leaving us over twenty years ago.",1454630400,,1043,4.589189189189189
4237139,2,B003ZYEHZ2,"American: The Bill Hicks Story is a boring documentary about a very interesting man. To put it lightly, this documentary was not what I was expecting. I thought this movie would contain footage and interviews with Bill Hicks, but it's more or less narrated by his friends and family. A majority of this film is animated with still photos and contains very little of Bill's actual stand up routines.

They didn't show his memorable freak outs against hecklers and didn't even showcase some of his best jokes in the film. I thought that this documentary would contain interviews and footage and show more of what a brilliant comedian Bill was. Instead, it's just a narrated, animated story that drags on for too long on useless details. It wasn't interesting, the pacing was awfully slow, and there really wasn't much of a story to tell.

What this documentary needed to include was more footage of Bill Hicks in general, not this campy, animated garbage that we were presented with. I was hoping this video would make my girlfriend more interested in this comedian, instead it put her to sleep while I watched and wondered why I wasted my money on this.

If you want more Bill Hicks, watch his stand up routines. There's no story to tell here except that he died tragically young and was under appreciated by his own country.",1453334400,3,1324,4.7229437229437226
4237140,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"Bill Hicks was probably the best comedian the U.S. has ever produced.  He was a comedian's comedian.

His message is still highly relevant today.  Perhaps, even more relevant now considering the state of the world.  It's tragic that we lost him at such a young age.  He was only 32 when he died, but he gave so much to the world during his brief time on earth.  His comedy makes you laugh, makes you think and helps you to wake up.  Anyone who encourages you to think for yourself and question authority is a hero in my book and Bill really does speak the truth fearlessly while making you piss your pants in laughter at the same time.

The documentary is excellent.  It's very well done and provides some wonderful insight into Bill's formative years, his family, his rise to fame (albeit cut short before his popularity could really take off) and his philosophy on life and living.

Bill Hicks really was an American patriot in the true sense of the word and so much more.  Dare I say, he was prophetic.  This documentary is totally worth watching and owning too.  Get it.  Watch it.  You won't regret it.",1449014400,,1107,4.492462311557789

If imitation is the best flattery, this guy couldn't have been any more revered. When I heard of his untimely passing, it was after I retired from the comic scene but I remembered vividly the experience of spending that weekend watching him own that club, that stage and those audiences.

When I came across this movie while exploring my Prime membership, I couldn't have anticipated watching a video anymore than this one and I was not disappointed. Even without my background, it was a teriffic film, well-produced and honored his legacy with justice.

4237168,3,B003ZYEHZ2,"This movie was ... weird. The story is told by the people who were closest to Bill Hicks--his friends and family, and the comedians who worked with him in Houston.

But most of the movie is the audio from their interviews laid over incredibly cheesy CGI effects that seem to try to animate still photos. For example, as people talk about Bill Hicks going to London, you'll see a photo of him superimposed inside a CGI'ed London taxi ""driving"" through the city. The lame graphics are distracting and make it hard to keep track of who's talking.

It's a shame, because the stories are very interesting and personal, plus there is a good amount of obscure Bill Hicks' videos.

4237171,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"There's been so much great stuff said in the other reviews, I won't rehash. I just want to add that as an artist (a musician in my case) I really appreciated the insights given into Bill's rise and development into the startlingly unique artist he eventually became. Specifically, the recording he made of himself in LA during his first serious push into comedy where he states that he hasn't been funny in months, he can't write, and he is so afraid in that state, is about as naked and bare as any artist can be. It represents a huge trough that anyone creative and worth a damn will repeatedly find himself or herself stuck in and for me to hear Bill dealing with it honestly, and carrying on anyway, gives me the same kind of resolve in my own work.

Basically, if you're a Bill Hicks fan, you'll love this. Perhaps one slight criticism is that they toned down a lot of his material for the video. Bill loved talking about sex and dating which was especially topical for him as a traveling performer. He was always extremely explicit about his experiences, and this biopic tends to take more of a socio-political view of his material. I can't help but think that Bill would get a kick out of the fact that such a large portion of his repertoire was omitted, although I can only speculate that the reason is to hold together a more focused thesis: that he was a new kind of comic and thinker. A lot could have been said about his explicit material though since he was coming of age in a time when ""clean"" comics were the norm.",1330300800,,1529,4.402826855123675

By creating animations out of images from Hicks' past and video clips, they made the absolute most out of all they clearly had.  The result comes across as exciting and different, which could also describe Hicks' career.  Very informative and certainly at least worth the rental, this 105-minute journey across Hicks' life does its best to note all of the most-defining moments in the man's career.",1323820800,,589,4.9393939393939394
4237173,2,B003ZYEHZ2,"I am a very big fan of Bill Hicks, and I think that the man was a visionary years ahead of his time.  This documentary however seemed to shed less insight into his past than it did give the opinions of his friends.  I know that having read the book, seen the Sane Man and other Bill Hicks DVD and that there probably isn't a heck of a lot more to learn so my expectations may have been too high.  I'd say that this is worth renting but I'd stray awy from purchasing it unless you are a mega-fan buying it to fulfill a completionist urge.",1318550400,2,537,4.047169811320755

4237175,1,B003ZYEHZ2,"One of the only DVD's I've honestly thought about returning (I own maybe 2000 DVD's that cover comedy, live comedy club performances, documentaries, feature films, How-To's, American History, Religion, Ancient History, Archeology, and more, because, I am a man of many interests and much curiosity.

First, of course, I must say that I regret his early loss to Cancer (as I do for every victim).

But as for as the DVD . . . Laugh out loud? . . . not once! Oh, I can see that were I in a typical comedy club (and I've been in many from L.A. to Chicago to Texas). . . and primed with booze or a little pot. . . or more, I might possibly have found his material - or delivery, funny!  Unfortunately, I was sober, drug-free and completely excited, anxious and feeling great anticipation for an hour or so of ear-splitting laughter and enjoyment.

Well, maybe today, I'll go to my safe, where 40-years ago, I placed to rest, a pill-bottle with about 10 or so joints - silently resting, undisturbed, waiting for some sort of emergency.  In all fairness, Perhaps I should go out and get one - light up - put Hick's Story on once again and finally see the humor . . . . . It might just work!

4237176,2,B003ZYEHZ2,"I always loved and remembered Bill's infrequent TV appearances.  He had that anti-establishment Carlin vibe, but this film spends too much time on the negative and destructive elements of his life. The abbreviated comedy bits included in this film are a poor representation of his humor especially when the film touts him as a legend. Bill was a true talent, this film just doesn't do him justice.  Not including his edited Letterman appearance in its entirety was a major omission on the filmmaker's part. Very Disappointing!!!",1315785600,,528,5.127906976744186
4237177,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"I loved Bill Hicks when he was alive and cherish what he stood for now that he is gone. Anytime I can see something new about him, it's a great thing. A lot of this film is made in an animated documentary style, much like the Robert Evans biopic, ""The Kid Stays in the Picture."" Be sure to check out Bill Hicks' feature length stand up videos as well, to get the full picture.",1314835200,,376,4.094594594594595
4237178,5,B003ZYEHZ2,Bill Hicks is/was a revolutionary genius! His comedy resonates across generations and sadly passed years ahead of his time. This is must watch and own for any smart comedy lover.,1311206400,,178,4.966666666666667
4237179,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"This is a touching film about the short life of American comedian, philosopher, performer Bill Hicks. He was not fully appreciated in his lifetime, but his ideas will live on.

This is an outstanding DVD and I recommend it highly. Unfortunately, the third party provider did not deliver a copy to my friend, but Amazon issues a refund instantly and effortlessly. I trust Amazon and I am enjoying the PRIME delivery service very much.

4237180,2,B003ZYEHZ2,"I concur with the guy from Portland, I had so looked forward to the American release of this film, what a disappointment. This brilliant artist deserved a more insightful reflection.  This is a pompous piece of film making, where the makers were more interested in the 'tech tricks' then the subject.

So then I went to the 'extras', where I was excited to see if there was new show footage of Bill's shows I had not seen.  There was, in frustrating tiny snippets--- it was a cruel tease.

The idea of Bill having any female relationships was completely ignored.  Interesting editorial choice, as women were a central theme to his life.

The interviews with the other Houston comics, and especially with Kevin Booth-- Bill's musical/artistic collaborator, were in fact interesting.  And then I got to the 'bonus' where Steve Booth was in Abbey Roads studio remixing Bill's music, I wanted to throw up.  How arrogant, he never worked on music with Bill, I really got the feeling this family was cashing in on Bill's wonderful legacy.  How pathetic.

IF YOU ARE REALLY interested in finding out more about Bill, I highly recommend the dvd ""Bill Hicks Live"". It includes 3 great performances, and the documentary ""Just a Ride"".  I also highly recommend Kevin Booth's biography ""Bill Hicks, Agent of Evolution"", it is a very interesting read and provides real insight into this complex artist.",1309305600,6,1389,4.8931623931623935
4237181,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"This documentry was awsome! I could relate to most of his life so I guess I'm a little bias. I didn't know who Bill was until a friend turned me onto Him a few years ago. His style was in your face and I see now that that's what people really deserve. As far as the content and production, it was charming and realistic. Artistic liberties were used in a fair and caring manner. the story itself is deeply touching. He was a patriot, and for that I love Him. I wish I could have met him. Get this film. At least watch the trailer on google, than make up your own mnd.",1309219200,,567,4.0265486725663715
4237182,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"Fantastic documentary.  I was much too young to enjoy Bill when he was here.  Thankfully... my older brother introduced me to Bill, not literally, when I was a teenager.  It was interesting to see his roots, who his friends were, what he did, and what happened in the end.  I loved the style as it is a beautiful film visually.  Very insightful.",1309219200,2,345,4.5

8411287,5,B003ZYEHZ2,"The blu-ray is everything I could have ever wanted. Slick menus with great audio samples and very beautiful and well thought-out backgrounds. I live in the usa, but it works on my PC's bluray player. I haven't tried my roommates player for his tv.

2 disks packed full of over 5 hours of extra footage! Tons of extra/extended interviews and a big handful of featurettes (short-films). This Blu-ray was made with love, and it shows. It instantly became one of my most cherished possessions.

Thank-you Kevin Booth and to everyone who helped make that project possible! I was a fan of bills for nearly 10 years before that docu came out, and every time I watch it I enjoy it immensely. You really are good at the documentary thing! I encourage you to not give up that gig.

I have the ""Sane Man"" and the ""bill hicks Live"" dvds, and I feel like this completes my Bill Hicks essentials video library. I am very grateful for this release. Buy it while you can!",1481846400,,955,4.508670520231214
