8306275,2,B001GNG2XY,"the movie is shot in a sort of dreamy grey sepia and has almost surreal backdrops. the actor makeup is sort of classical and this movie looks and feels like a classic silent movie...visualy. If all that mattered was visual appreciation this would rank a bit higher...though there is no different tint sequences, it still has a pretty neat look to it. Even the looking around eye movements add to this curious silent.

apparently translated from German, the dialogue cards appear authentic though they have no accompanying graphics. About 1/3 to 1/2 the time I had to replay them to read them as they often went by too quickly. There are a couple hand written letters and a telegram to read and they are indistict and hard to read and I could only get the gist of them...though they are seamlessly placed if this is a translated movie...as these are in English or French to English transitioned.(It appears this was edited for the American audiences but it was edited too much so it doen't flow...I guess the American editors familiar with it after watching it assumed what they knew from their first watching it was still understandablle after they edited it.)

the music is not distracting or particularily inventive. I had to load this one about 10 or 11 times on my $10 dvd player to get it to load.

the box says this movie is 83 minutes long. hogwash. it's 53:30. there is a little bonus of a Bela Lugosi TV appearance in ""You Asked For It"" which appears to be from about 1950. it's only 8 minutes and 35 seconds. even with the adds which are 12 1/2 minutes this still doesn't add up to the posted 83 minutes. perhaps the 83 minutes was supposed to be printed as 53.

First this is not your typical Bela Lugosi fare; the title is a bit misleading if you think it's about a typical Bela type movie. ...he plays an in love man who comes in with a plot of sorts...if your looking for typical Bela Lugosi stuff or a nifty story this will dissapopint in both ways, though it is interesting to see Lugosi 11 years before Dracula.

the movie could have been very key and interesting as it is actualy filmed in 1920 and about the Russian struggles after the revolution and in that light it is an interesting peice. However the story is disjointed, and difficult to follow. It's like they figure we've figured out stuff or assume stuff and leave out key transitional sequences, so one is always trying to figure out what's going on or catching up. At one point...or perhasps the entire movie I thought we were situated in Paris when suddenly it is revealed we are in Russia. The key charachter who the movies title is named after is only revealed as who she is and suddenly the movie is over. I had to laugh...that's it!?

I hate giving a silent movie a 2 but it really can't rate any higher.",1329696000,2,2788,4.478346456692913
8306276,1,B001GNG2XY,"Very poor picture quality, even for Alpha. The sound is okay, but the washed out picture takes away from what is an otherwise rare and interesting Bela Lugosi silent film before he came to America.

If you can find a DVD copy for $1.00, that's about all it is worth. I love Bela Lugosi, and this shoddy DVD release is a real insult to his memory.",1309219200,,346,4.242424242424242
8306277,3,B001GNG2XY,"Best known as Bela Lugosi's earliest surviving photoplay (but nowhere near his first screen appearance), DAUGHTER OF THE NIGHT (silent-1920) was originally a two-part German feature called ""Der Tanz auf dem Vulkan"" (or ""dance on the volcano"") that ran at least 100 minutes total. Recut to a considerably shorter work for American audiences, this is now the only version known to exist.

Its star, Lee Parry appeared in dozens of German films between 1919 and '35. Her career ended by age 38 with the French-made ADIEU VIENNE (1939). Parry remains unknown to all but the most knowledgeable of silent or Germanic cinemaphiles.

SYNOPSIS--
An abundance of retrogressions plus perhaps editing holes make this picture most hard to follow. The volcano of the story is an allegoric (and visual) reference to the Russian Revolution. Here, a rather wooden Lugosi plays a wealthy Frenchman who falls for a Bolshevik actress/singer. Any propagandistic attempt to portray the revolutionaries as compassionate types is undone by this tale's brutal ending. Or maybe that's just history...

ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average. Considering its age, ""Daughter of the Night"" is one of their better efforts.

8306278,5,B001GNG2XY,I love it. Bela Lugosi looks so young. One of my fav movies! I'll be keeping this forever!,1229040000,,90,4.055555555555555
8306279,5,B001GNG2XY,Very good film for a real Bela Lugosi's fan. It shows one of the earliest silent films and we can observe his energy and character in acting.,1228262400,2,141,4.2592592592592595
8306280,3,B001GNG2XY,"Along with the 2006 release of Lugosi's The Deer Slayer, this is a big upgrade from the collector's copy I own & I would recommended it for Lugosi fans; I paid an Amazon 3rd party seller $3.79 + shipping brand new & consider it a steal at that price!

Alpha seems to be cleaning up their act lately. While nowhere near the quality we expect from Kino, Image, Criterion, etc, this print is of much higher quality then the pd collector's copies on ebay & higher quality then I expected. It didn't used to be that way, I have several pd prints that are much better then the equivalent pre 2006 Alpha releases.",1226793600,11,606,4.3628318584070795
