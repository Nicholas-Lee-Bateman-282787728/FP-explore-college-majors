8146395,1,B000ILYYC6,"It takes a lot for me to put in a one-star review, but honestly, this movie was so bad on so many levels, that something must be said. I suppose I'm mostly irritated that I missed it on TCM and bought it, thinking that Maugham had authored the stage play so it must be good.

It's hard to know where to start. The script is bad, the acting is bad, and in the final act an effete homosexual is introduced as a sort of deus ex machina, who is supposed to pull everything together and explain anything you didn't already understand. Now, that would be bad enough, but the deus ex machina only adds to the confusion, is on screen for no more than a minute, and explains nothing!

Frankly, I don't know why this is even in print. One assumes that the epigrams from Maugham were his and not the scriptwriter, but even those fall flat. Really sorry about this, but I want the two hours of my life back. My apologies to Mr. Maugham.",1231804800,,924,4.244318181818182
