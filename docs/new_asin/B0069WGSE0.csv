8495541,3,B0069WGSE0,2011 LBL is actually boring.  Not to mention that the DVD picks up AFTER they've made the turn back to Liege.  Fleche Wallone totally diff story.  Exciting peloton chase of the leaders.  Watched it twice back-to-back.  That race is worth the price alone.  Would have given 4 stars if LBL was any better.,1427241600,,303,4.622641509433962
