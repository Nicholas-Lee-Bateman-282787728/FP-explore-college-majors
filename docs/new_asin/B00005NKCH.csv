I love blue seed, it is one of my absolute favorite anime.",1306108800,,111,3.8260869565217392
7947470,4,B00005NKCH,"The first 18 or so episodes of this series are mostly slapstick disguising an essentially tragic theme.  Momiji Fujiyama who comes from the line of the Kushinada (more later) is a hapless schoolgirl who finds she is the focus of a war with the Arigami (plant demons) in which she is intended to be sacrificed to save humanity.  Unfortunately, this weighty theme gets lost in the writer's efforts to lighten up the script.
Then, suddenly, the sight gags stop and the reality of the impending doom of Japan sinks in.  There are indications of this in the third DVD, put now the story line loses its episodic nature and sense of humor, returning to its original grim vision.  But even now, Momiji, ever something of a klutz, nearly gets lost in her worries over Kusinagi, her guardian.  Somehow, the story pulls itself together again, manages some surprises, and delivers a strong ending.  Leaving this reviewer reeling, of course.
It is finally time to give a precise of the Japanese Kushinada legend that forms the basis of Blue Seed.  At this point, you have seen enough so that it won't give anything away.  Susano-Oh, who seems to be the villain of this piece, was a kami (spirit).  The god of Storms and Forests, to be precise.  Something of a troublemaker, he still had a good heart.  In one story, a great dragon called Orochi was coming to a village every year to eat one of eight daughters.  These were the Kushinadas.  Susano-Oh comes to the village, falls in love with the last daughter and defeats Orochi.  From the dragon's body he takes a sword called the Kusinagi.
This happy story is turned about by creator Yuzo Takada to depict a world on the verge of terminal pollution.  One where it may be better to destroy humanity rather than risk complete ruin.  This crisis of decision and the desire of the Arigami to rule the world are the real story of Blue Seed.  It is told in terms of a young woman whose weakness, loving too much, is really her strength, if she would only realize it.
Expect some confusion and surprises as the story does a complete u-turn.  Because the story's zigzag course, I can't give it full grades, even though it finally redeems itself with a flair. The poor quality English dubbing, however, is its worst flaw.  By all means use the subtitles.",1050019200,,2283,4.620347394540943
7947471,4,B00005NKCH,"Any fan of the Blue Series should definately get the DVD over the VHS.  This volume contains the last 6 episodes of the series (21-26), and includes both the Japanese w/ subtitle and English Dubbed versions of the show!  Considering single episodes on VHS are the same price, you just can't do wrong with the Blue Seed DVD.",1020816000,,323,4.551724137931035
7947472,5,B00005NKCH,"This review is not only about the last DVD release in the series, but also as a review of the entire series. I have never really been into Anime like most people, but this one caught my attention. Blue Seed is about a young girl who finds out that her humdrum life is not all it seems. Taking its cues from japanese mythology as well as other world religions, the story involves the coming of the auragami, a race of spirits who exist in the form of a 'blue seed', or mitama, and must possess a host in order to Take over Japan and the world. The only known way to stop them is to sacriface a female virgin from the Kushinada family. It turns out that, like all living things, certain energies are released that put the auragami to sleep. Momiji, age 15, must be sacrificed in order to save the world.
Luckily she has friends that want to find an alternative to killing a young girl. The fight for the world begins when the auragami try to kill Momiji while keeping her safely inside a Ceramic field, thus removing any threat to their existance. A team of scientists and military types known as the TAC Rescue Momiji, but not before An auragami nearly kills the girl outside the field. Without giving away too many details, Momiji winds up with a BLUE SEED implanted on her chest! Nuff sed.
I now have the entire series on DVD. It can be had on four discs, 26 episodes, With both english and japanese languages, as well as spanish! The clarity of the DVD format really shows here, not because the original material is so good, but because you can see the grain in the film, which in a strange way adds to the overall look of the series. The discs also include the now infamous ""Omake Theatres"", little humorous 'outtakes' if you will, some racy and some downright side splitting.
Another thing to mention about this series is the english voice acting. In the past, I have often hated the english dubbing of any movie, and in the first few episodes of Blue Seed the acting is at times not very good. But as the series goes on, it improves dramatically, and by the time I got to the last two discs I found that I prefered it over the original japanese. By the time you reach the last episode, the emotional quality of the dubbing is just dead on right, and at times you thing that maybe the series was made with english in mind.
This is the only Anime that I have ever cared enough about to own. As a total package of dvds, this cant be missed.",1013731200,2,2442,4.32244008714597
7947473,5,B00005NKCH,"It's amazing how much this series changed over its run.  What started out as a monster-of-the-week vs. why-me-girl series (although an extremely good one) has become an all-out showdown between forces that would destroy the Earth and those who would renew it.  Only at the end do we discover Susanoh-oh's true purpose, and how Momiji and her sister Kaede fit in to the picture.  A monumental series, too often overlooked, and *well* worth buying!",1005696000,,446,5.0
