3761220,5,B001PU8MYA,"Randomly was thinking of movies I still needed to buy and specifically remembered A Man Apart and Running Scared. And what do you know, I find this gem for $5.99!!! I still can't believe how coincidental it was, but neverthless, both movies are great and severely underrated. Easily Paul Walker's and Vin Diesel's best films prior to the newer Fast and the Furious franchise films.",1380240000,,381,4.876923076923077
3761221,5,B001PU8MYA,Double features are nice but this one is exceptional because both movies are seriously under rated. You can't go wrong for the price.,1343865600,,133,4.826086956521739
3761222,4,B001PU8MYA,"Both movies are alone worth the price, but as a two on one disc, it was unbeatable. Bought separately it would cost twice what I paid for. Running Scared is more gritty then A Man Apart, which Vin Diesel stars in and did a great acting job for an early effort. He had hair in this one, while Paul Walker stars in Running Scared as a 12 year undercover FBI agent trying to hit the Boston Mobs. But are riveting dramas and a good back to back offering for the evening. I'd recommend it.",1328227200,3,484,4.159574468085107

8334693,3,B001PU8MYA,"A man Apart was fine, but Running Scared was pretty stupid. I guess its okay in a set but thats it.",1387411200,,99,3.761904761904762
8334694,5,B001PU8MYA,Love both of these movies. I think Running Scared is probably Paul Walkers best movie. I have never owned either but seen each one a bunch of times and just had to get it so I got the double feature. Great for a movie night soon and got it for a great price.,1386547200,,258,3.8867924528301887
