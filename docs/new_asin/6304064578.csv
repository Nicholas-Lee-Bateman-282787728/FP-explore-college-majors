7902292,5,6304064578,"I ordered this video hoping it was the one I remembered seeing at Christmas time on t.v. when I was little.  It is indeed the same delightful story of Fenwick, the little elf who doesn't seem to fit in anywhere, until Santa discovers that his true talent is caring for the reindeer and his generous and loving nature. There is a short animated introduction to the film, but the story itself is portrayed by live actors, including Johnnie Whitaker as Snap the elf, Walter Slezak as Santa, and the adorable Michael Link as Fenwick. Hopefully this little film will be restored someday and put out on dvd, but until then this vhs version will bring back many happy memories.",1322179200,6,670,4.630252100840337
