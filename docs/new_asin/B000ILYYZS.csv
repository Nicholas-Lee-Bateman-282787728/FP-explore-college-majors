2658792,5,B000ILYYZS,"The stormchasers, while coming way too close for comfort, give you an up close and personal look at tornadoes.  Unbelievable footage - not to mention the highly entertaining personalities of the guys.  My husband and I have watched this movie several times and still get caught up in all the excitement.  Great fun and very informative!  I highly recommend it!",1173571200,2,360,4.95
2658793,5,B000ILYYZS,"...I loved this documentary. I grew up with tornado drills and warnings and they were just part of life, but ""Tornado Glory"" was really illuminating. I loved watching this from the perspective of people so passionate about getting inside the twister and learning how it ticks. It was exhilarating. It actually made me want to go out and chase a tornado. (It also made me want to install a cellar.) These guys reminded me of people I would have hung out with in college, and I enjoyed watching their interactions and conflicts. Good stuff.",1168560000,5,538,4.73404255319149
2658794,5,B000ILYYZS,"My son loves tornadoes and violent weather...go figure.  He says he wants to be a tornado chaser when he grows up.  I bought this for him a few months ago and he loves it.  It chronicles storm chasing by some fanatical but likable college kids majoring in meteorology (or maybe grad students in the same) and their obsession with tornado chasing.  Very cool, some great shots of tornadoes up close and personal.. Also some awesome storms and hail.  Definitely worth the money.  Its a PBS Documentary.",1165363200,5,500,4.755813953488372
8146071,1,B000ILYYZS,I'm not sure if this is even worth 'ONE' star... but I HAD to give it something. Seriously... this was as enjoyable as a kick in the crotch. And the 2 'storm chasers' were even bigger jokes... at least Reed was. (I swear there were a few times that I thought he may have orgasmed from seeing a tornado. Typical loud-mouthed college jock type.) You learned NOTHING from them! Do your self a favor and keeping going... you CAN find something better. I think there may be a documentary on how toilet paper is made that's far more riveting.,1408060800,,536,4.424242424242424
8146072,3,B000ILYYZS,"This video is pretty lame, especially if you're a fan of Storm Chasers. It's early Reed Timmer stuff, though. Everyone has to start somewhere, and this is where he started. Some good tornado footage, but a lot more dramatizing and talk about Reed's personality, more than actual chases.",1386028800,,286,4.979166666666667
8146073,3,B000ILYYZS,This is a Birthday gift for my grandson and his birthday is later this month and the DVD hasn't been viewed yet.,1346630400,,112,4.136363636363637
8146074,5,B000ILYYZS,"Caveat:  If you are looking for a documentary just about tornadoes, then this is probably not the best DVD for you, since it is more about tornado chasing.

I first found out about these storm chasers through a suggestion on Netflix a few months ago, and I was hooked.  It's kind of funny to see that the relationship dynamic between Reed and Joel hasn't changed much over the years, however I would imagine tension would evolve between anyone who spends that much time in a car together.

I really liked how they explained the formation of tornadoes and weather phenomenon in layman's terms, so that those of us who did not go to school for meteorology could understand.

I definitely liked this documentary much better than the t.v. show itself.  My only wish would've been for it to be a little longer, but I really loved it!",1339286400,,828,4.598639455782313
8146075,4,B000ILYYZS,"Although this is one of the earlier documentaries shot in the widescreen format, and the beautiful images of tornadoes
led to it being featured on PBS stations' new HDTV channels, this could just as accurately be called a ""buddy picture.""
Tornado Glory explores the lives and relationships of two very different young men.
They have one thing in common. They think its fun to chase tornadoes -- to get way too close and shoot video of them.
Several television-tornado-chaser series have come along since this documentary was first screened at film festivals in 2004, and one series is a pretty obvious copy.
Unfortunately the TV shows are often just a bunch of artificially hyped and edited storm scenes, clumsily lashed together.
There is beautiful storm footage in this documentary. But there's more to it than that.
On the subject of storm footage -- this documentary is more realistic. Real storm chasers (including Reed and Joel), do much more waiting and wandering and going home empty-handed than they do actually driving into tornadoes. This DVD is more honest about that part of the game, while the TV programs generally gloss over that fact.
If you only want to see video of wind and rain -- this may not be your cup of tea. Try Youtube.
BTW -- I was involved in supervising this production.",1301961600,,1301,4.838565022421525
8146076,2,B000ILYYZS,"If the show has Reed Timmer & Joel Taylor in it, you are sure going to expect an action packed show.  Unfortunately, Tornado Glory falls very short of thrilling TV.  Save your money & watch the TV series ""Storm Chasers"".  You will get much more out of watching the series than this cheap attempt of a DVD.",1278633600,,305,4.315789473684211
8146077,1,B000ILYYZS,"I can only guess that the two college kids who made this boring disaster of a DVD have been in here posting fake reviews. Nothing else could explain how this amateurish, sleep-inducing mess could get favorable press. To be blunt...it stinks. You'll see more tornados in Hawaii than in this DVD. Almost all the time is one of the two pointing the home video camera at the other one, conducting an ""interview"".  It looks like exactly what it it, a home movie made by teenagers. The tornado footage isn't a SHADOW of the film I've seen on any other storm chasing video, which surprised me. At least I expected some good footage.

Avoid this rip-off at all cost. ANY episode of Storm Chasers, which is free, will excite you a lot more than this sleeper.",1239062400,,749,4.54074074074074
8146078,1,B000ILYYZS,"I want my money back.  80% talking heads and close ups of the chasers' faces from the back seat of the car and only 20% of storm shots.  And the Shouting, Dictatorial Reed was annoying.  Instead causing the viewer to  ""feel the moment"" during in the exciting and dangerous moments of chasing, it is very, very annoying.  Shut up!  And the condescending volley of orders...!  ""Do this!  Do that!  Get the blankity-blank gas if you want.""  I finally turned the volume off, fast-forwarded to the few storm scenes offered and have just finished throwing this dvd in the trash.  Useless!",1211587200,3,582,4.72
8146079,2,B000ILYYZS,I'm gonna quote toby keith and say this movie need a little less talk and alot more action.,1183939200,,91,4.111111111111111
8146080,5,B000ILYYZS,"We loved this movie!  The footage is so captivating it totally sucks you in (pun intended).  It's both scary and amazing to see how close the storm chasers get to tornadoes, and to see what people in tornado-prone areas of the country have to face each year.  The storm chasers that are featured are fun, likeable, and of course, slightly nuts for doing what they do.  We'll be watching this documentary again - probably every storm season!",1178668800,4,440,4.675324675324675
