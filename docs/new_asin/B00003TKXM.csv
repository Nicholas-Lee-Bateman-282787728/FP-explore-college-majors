It is an excellent subtle satire on communism as seen through Polish eyes, disguised as the misgivings of the intrepid heroes concerning capitalism and race relations as they journey to visit an expatriate in the big city of Chicago.

Very funny and interesting scenes back home in their village and aboard a cruise ship as they venture to America.  A dissertation on the evils of capitalism as pronounced by the official communist line while aboard an airliner headed to Chicago was priceless!

Some (relatively) shocking scenes of racial prejudice by one of the travelers belay the official all men are equal communist view, as racism exists even in communist countries, if only unofficially.  Not to worry, his prejudices are thoroughly trashed by movie's end.  Very funny in the interim, however!",1270771200,,927,5.1879194630872485
