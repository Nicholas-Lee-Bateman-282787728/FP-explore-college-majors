8586586,3,B0009IWFTM,Hello - I would like to review the product - which arrived in good time etc. but unfortunately it was a DVD and not the Planetary Science  model making kit - it seems to have the same name exactly.  Would be good to know if the model kit is available.  Best wishes.  Twig Hall,1266105600,,276,4.055555555555555
