807083,1,6304202733,"A bad, bad movie. Part of the problem was that whoever was responsible for the final form of the script (whether writer, director, producer, or studio) couldn't decide whether this was going to be a drama with comic overtones or vice versa. But even if this is supposed to be a sad film, it is sad without any redeeming aspects. Just a bunch of sad, unlikeable people. David Schwimmer's character is unbearably pathetic, Barbara Hershey's character is unbearable (and I have to add that I have always liked Barbara Hershey, so seeing her in this role was especially painful), Carol Kane as the mother is sad, and Schwimmer's friends are all superficial.
I think the makers of the film were trying to emulate Albert Brooks, but with slight problem of not possessing his deft touch. A profoundly disappointing film. Though I must add that Gwyneth Paltrow was much better than the rest of the film.  I kept feeling bad for her that she was stuck in some a poorly conceived film.",936316800,6,975,4.701754385964913

I don't really understand some reviews saying this is not a comedy because I thought it was hilarious! Sure the subjects/themes in the movie are a little morbid and outlandish but that's what makes it a worth while movie to watch.

If you're looking for something funny, nothing psychological or emotionally demanding then you can't go wrong with this!",1375056000,,486,4.926829268292683
807414,1,6304202733,"Despite the keywords ""hilarious"" and ""comedy"", this film was anything but funny. After 52 minutes, we finally called it quits. The lagging plot and lack of real substance to the story (which suddenly falls off the moral precipice) were more than could be endured. If this hadn't been free, I'd've been even more disappointed.",1374796800,,325,5.037037037037037
807415,5,6304202733,Loved this movie! Such a cute story and a great ending! I will definitely  recommend this to friends and family!!,1374451200,,113,4.65
807416,5,6304202733,"I must admit that I love this movie.  Released in 1999, it was one of the last movies that reflected the serious yet hopeful movies of the 90's.  The dot com era had not yet gone bust.  9/11/2001 hadn't happened.  Despite all of our flaws, the movie is optimistic about our ability to overcome our humanness and reach for the future.  The music sets great tones for me as well.  I love Neil Young.

I would characterize this as a tragic comedy.  Schwimmer's character is weak and sniveling and trying to find himself after college.  The other characters are also at crossroads.  Gwenneth Paltrow is a bit of a caricature, but she captures magnificently the just out of reach girl and unrequited love.  Her character is at a crossroads as well as Schwimmer's ""other"" love interest, the incomparable Barbara Hershey.

The movie is a character study with a bit of comedy thrown in to lighten the mood.  It's greatest strength is in showing the brokenness that we all share.  Sometimes it is funny.  Sometimes it is sad.  Many times it is awkward and embarrassing.  Sometimes we must resign ourselves that people are going to make mistakes despite our best wishes for them.  The beauty of the story is that each of the characters deal with the brokenness and lean on each other in order to get by and then move on.

I'm probably reading more into it than is there.  It's not Dostoyevsky after all.  But the story is entertaining.  The characters are all recognizable and relatable.  The music is wonderful.  It's a story about 20 somethings learning how to do life.  I would recommend it for that reason alone.  There are plenty of movies that explore the dark side of life and leave the viewer with no hope.  Those movies seem to revel in destroying expectations.  This movie is simply positive.  It has a hopeful tone.  Give it a chance.",1373932800,4,1835,4.626168224299065
807417,4,6304202733,It was a very cute movie. I enjoyed  watching it on a Sunday afternoon. Would recommend it to a friend.,1371686400,,103,4.15

807419,4,6304202733,"Purchased two DVDs of the ""Pallbearer"" ~ saw part of it on late-night TV and thought it would be a great Christmas gift for my 26 year-old son ~ I also purchased it as a ""To Me - From Me"" gift and watched the entire movie; wonderful!",1230336000,,233,3.978723404255319
807420,4,6304202733,"A little far fetched, and based around some dishonesty, but not bad. I guess I have more of a concience and would have said something up front than drag it out as Tom thompsen (David Schimmer) did, but at first I can understand him being polite in a time of grief.  The main storyline of this film is Tom is asked to be a pallbearer at a high school classmates funeral. Unfortunately, Tom nor any of his friends can remember this guy.  Along the way, another high school aquaintence (gwenith paltrow) come into the film as Tom's dream girl.  As tom persues his dream woman, he soon finds himself entangled in wierd situation with the mother of the poor departed.  The movie takes off there.  I don't think this movie was ever ment to be a laugh out loud comedy, but it has some funny moments and serious ones as well.  I actually enjoyed it, and I don't really care for David schwimmer, and I hate the show friends.  So check it out, not to shabby.",1174262400,,948,4.3522727272727275
807421,2,6304202733,"This is one of those movies which simply blows away a good promise after the first half-hour...

I just did not get it. The movie is directed almost completely avoid of any intention of creating humor, even in the scenes clearly written to be funny!!",1129507200,,250,4.555555555555555
807422,2,6304202733,"This movie just couldn't decide what it wanted to be, whether a comedy, drama, or romance. At just little over an hour & a half, it felt overly long, and dragged. When plied with alcohol, I can easily fall asleep during a particularly dull movie, but I was tired as it was after having not slept well the previous night, and kept having to eat something to keep me awake during this. I never noticed it as much during Friends, but David Schwimmer has one expression and that's the irritating hangdog expression. The whole film felt like the way you feel when you're in a rush, and people are (deliberately) getting in your way, or just coming to a dead stop, and leave you walking off, muttering to yourself. The Pallbearer tries to put a different spin on a romantic comedy and fails miserably.

This film's one saving grace is the actress playing Schwimmer's mum, who's never given the decency of a name, just credited by ""Tom's mother"". She was in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen as Miss Baggoli, although she looked like the mum from Carrie 2 as well. She wasn't on screen apart from a couple of scenes, and she was hilarious, especially in one of her early scenes, when she opens the door to her son's room and finds one of those security chains blocking her way. The look on her face is fantastic, including her line: ""What's this friggin' chain for?""

Apart from her, this film belongs on really late night TV, where no-one will ever see it.",1107820800,3,1453,4.520912547528517
807558,5,6304202733,"The first time I watched this movie I was expecting an all out comedy. This is mainly due to the film's misleading ad campaign. However, despite my expectations, I found this film to be quite moving. The emotional arc the story takes is completely inverted from that of your average film. This means that the movie reaches it's peak when the viewer is at their lowest, saddest state. The story then arcs back upwards to reach a more or less rewarding resolution. If you've ever been depressed or lonely enough to find yourself relating to David Schwimmer's character here then empathy alone will pull you into the story.

If I had to pick a flaw to this film it would be that the ending is a little too hopefull. Filmmakers tend to want to wrap things up with a bow and a smile without realizing that we as viewers will accept a sad ending if it's done well. Through the course of the movie a somber tone is crafted with such skill that I desired an ending that would do justice to that mood. What comes is more of a reversal of tone that does a little bit of a disservice to all that came before. Really I'm just being critical though, in the end this is still a wonderfull movie that hasn't gotten a fair rap thanks to a blunderfull ad campaign designed to make people think this would be ""Friends: The Movie"" which it really isn't. Buy this DVD, you won't regret it.",1107734400,5,1369,4.368627450980392

807560,3,6304202733,"Despite the utter comtempt and loathing I have for Friends (For being the most obvious, stupid, unfunny comedy very much
like the equally appalling Will & Grace), I nevertheless quite enjoyed David Swimmer's performance in this film. It was quite an enjoyable, lighthearted if slightly predictable romantic comedy. Paltrow was even reasonably good in it. So whilst not exactly a masterpiece, nonetheless an interesting little Black comedy for those moments whwn you have nothing else better to do.",1084147200,,497,5.384615384615385
807561,3,6304202733,"David Schwimmer.  I'll admit it.  He grates on my nerves like it's no one's business.  I find him annoying, cloying, and repulsive in every role I've seen him in.  He's the major reason I avoid Friends like the plague (although there are plenty of other reasons for that).  But this movie also has the anti-Schwimmer:  Gwyneth Paltrow.  I can't explain exactly why, but I find her enchanting and intriguing. (Maybe it's because she is a terrific actress, or because she seems so sweet and nice even off the screen.)  So, there you have have it.  A movie with two polar extremes ... the hideous and the sublime, the awful and beautiful, the appalling and the ... you get the point.
Some people might quickly dismiss this movie as a Graduate wannabe.  There's some truth to that.  The Pallbearer is quite derivative of the Graduate; it's a play on the young man, older woman, younger woman triangle, and it certainly doesn't have the Graduate's silkiness--or it's wise intelligence.  There's nothing in the Pallbearer that matches the uneasy end where Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross nervously sit at the back of the bus with this quietly panicky, ""What now?"" look on their faces.
But it does have some well-orchestrated moments, including a brunch from hell, and some genuine, quirky characters.  I'd give it a chance; it's worth watching.  And if you can stomach David Schwimmer, you might really like it.",1073779200,6,1407,4.857142857142857

807563,4,6304202733,"The reason I love this movie is pretty simple.  The movie overall is a date movie and is good, but most people won't like it if they expect to laugh through the whole thing.  Sure there are funny spots, but the movie isn't great for those.  It's great for the heartwrenching scenes with David Schwimmer and Gwenyth Paltrow.  Including one particular sad one when they play Sheryl Crow's ""I Shall Believe.""  David Schwimmer and Gwenyth Paltrow dance to this.  When you see the movie you'll see why this scene is more heartwrenching than it is happy.  So, if you are looking for a good movie that can pull on your heartstrings as well as make you laugh occasionally with Schwimmers hyjinx, then this is a good one for you.",1028332800,4,720,4.534883720930233
807564,2,6304202733,"The first 10 minutes of this movie were rather amusing and after that it settled down to a real napper. Endless long face shots of Schimmer in particular looking concerned,pathetic,etc.,etc.made the film a test of one's staying power. Occasional humor and the interest generated by Paltrow and Hersey helped,but the movie was unsavable. A 25 year old with his weird mother and bunk beds,Paltrow's pathetic outfits and Hersey,s atrocious hair and truly strange behavior are just a few of the blots on this would-be landscape. Michael Rappaport and that Bitsy character trying to go over the top was also borderline offensive. As I review the film in my mind, Two stars might have been too high! Skip this one and enjoy an extra episode of Friends.",1021161600,3,746,4.928571428571429
807565,5,6304202733,"The Pallbearer is an interesting story of a man (David Schwimmer) who is called out of the blue by the mother (Barbara Hershey) of a 'friend' from high school.  There's one little problem.  He didn't know the guy!  Instead of telling the mother the truth, he lied and performed his duties with his best friends in the 'audience' laughing their butts off at him.
His little lie led to two relationships.  One was with the dead guy's mom, who somehow is able to lure him into a kind of sickening sexual relationship that he can seem to manipulate his way out of.  The other is with his high school crush (Gwenyth Paltrow) who was less than amused that he chose to lie to the dead guy's mom.
His lies end up getting twisted and he has to work out the problems they've caused.

I happen to think he's a wonderful comic actor, but then, I like nuance and subtlety.  Comparisons between this film and The Graduate are inevitable, but I think it stands up well on its own.  It's a poignant and touching coming-of-age story of arrested development, more intelligent and palatable than today's gross-out bro' comedies.  Excellent screenwriting, casting and frame-by-frame art direction.  The pacing is a bit slow, could have edited out a lot of close-ups of Schwimmer moping.  Still I think it is under-rated, and someone must have agreed, as apparently it got Schwimmer a part in ""Friends.""
