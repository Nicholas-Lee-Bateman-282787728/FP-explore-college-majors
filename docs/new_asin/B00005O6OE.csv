My guy liked it though.. Honey, if it comes up missing I had nothing to do with it :)",1003017600,,191,3.8
1640625,5,B00005O6OE,"I bought this DVD just because I seen it on a shelf, and I said to myself: ""wow C.O.C. has a DVD!?!?"" I just had to have it. I took a gamble on it, popped it in the DVD and I'm impressed. The Picture is sharp, excellent production. Sound is Good and it has plenty of band footage, photo gallery, and interviews. This DVD mainly consists of a live concert which includes 15 songs (These Shrouded Temples, Diablo Blvd., Senor Limpio, King of the Rotten, Wiseblood, Who's Got The Fire, Albatross, My Grain, Congratulations Song, 13 Angels/7days, Vote with a bullet, Zippo, Long whip/big america, shelter, Clean my wounds) I was torn between giving this 4.5 - 5 stars because It is a good video, although I do have to critique it (for those nit picks out there) and all I am about to mention is being very, VERY critical: Maybe the vocal sound could be turned up just a tiny pinch, maybe there could be more stage antics, like jumping around, pyrotechnics, and finally what would have made this DVD the God of all DVD's was if they played most of the tracks off of their ""Blind"" album. One of the best under rated bands/album ever.
  Anyways, like I said this is being overly critical, this is one of the best DVD's I own (next to Alice Cooper's Brutal Planet, and Metallica's Cunning stunts),
  So Buy it on Amazon and save $$$, and spread the word, C.O.C. rocks!!!",1002931200,13,1362,4.457831325301205
1640626,4,B00005O6OE,"It's not easy to go wrong with any COC offering.  This DVD showcases the power and aggression of one of the most under-rated heavy bands around.  The mix of this recording leaves a little to be desired.  Regardless of the bad mix - you can still see what makes their live performances blow the carcass off of just about anyone making heavy music today.  The great thing is - THEY DO NOT DO (C)RAPROCK.  Straight-up heavy rock n roll as it should be.  No additives, no preservatives.  A better mix would bring 5 stars IMHO.",1002844800,8,522,4.431578947368421
7948467,5,B00005O6OE,Awesome concert footage of one my favorite bands of all time!,1456876800,,61,4.636363636363637
7948468,5,B00005O6OE,"It took a little while to find this, but I'm glad I did. The recent reunion of my favorite C.O.C. line up inspired me to try to find the only C.O.C. dvd I'm aware of. Glad I did. Good performance. Great songs. Should have bought this much sooner.",1456704000,,246,4.145833333333333
7948469,5,B00005O6OE,This is my favorite DVD in my collection now and I don't foresee that changing anytime soon... :),1419465600,,97,4.444444444444445
7948470,5,B00005O6OE,"Dude what more can i say then i love it ! I been a fan of the NOLA music scene for about 11 years i'm 24 now but man i'm finally happy for a dvd. Who would have thought one of my ex girlfriends turned me on to the dvd & man i was sold. Jimmy Bower(Eyehategod,Superjoint Ritual,Down) is on the drums and i'd rather have him than anybody else,dude never misses a note. Pepper Keenan is a great singer man and i'm glad we get to hear some variety in their songs. Glad that they are all at top performance for the dvd cuz it's excellent. Vital if your a COC fan or even a DOWN fan you will dig it. Or if COC is new to you check these guys out they are great. Oldschool bluesy southern rock. I'm loving the effects they lay throughout their show like when Pepper does a mind melting solo or Woody drops in some sick licks it drips & echoes the screen like lsd or whiskey buzz effects. Great band great live dvd. The speed on the camera is not super fast,they give you shots 5-30 seconds at a time. Go buy it !",1404345600,,1004,3.9752475247524752
7948471,5,B00005O6OE,All the popular songs and more.  Bonus footage too.  I love it.  A must for COC fans.  DVD quality picture and sound.  This is the DVD movie.,1360540800,,141,4.074074074074074
7948472,4,B00005O6OE,"Corrosion Of Conformity's Live Volume: The Movie was recorded live in Detroit at the Harpo's venue and released in 2001.  This was the band's first and to date only live DVD and captures the band live in support of their America's Volume Dealer album from 2000.

Jimmy Bower, who plays alongside Pepper Keenan in the fantastic Phil Anselmo fronted super group Down, provides the drums for this live concert as the band were in between losing and reuniting with long time Drummer and founding member Reed Mullin.

The band really hammer home a strong and confident performance, aided by Bower's fine drumming. Each member puts in a good show, the guitars are big and heavy as they should be, the bass really stands out and Pepper's vocals stand up very well in the live environment.

The setlist is strong, concentrating mostly on the band's Pepper Keenan era material. Standout tracks include `Wiseblood,' and `King Of The Rotten' as well as the big hits like `Clean My Wounds,' and `Albatross,' which go down a storm live.

The sound mix is pretty great, really conveying the heaviness and southern edge to some of the riffs and letting you hear what each member is doing perfectly for most of the duration.

In terms of camera work and visuals the DVD is also pretty successful and it has certainly aged better than some of the concert DVDs that were released around that era, some of which are now feeling comparatively dated.

If any complaint were to be leveled at this Live DVD it would be that the editing is perhaps a little overenthusiastic, there is a lot more double-exposure than one would expect, things brake into slow motion at unexpected points and there is sometimes a seeming desire to get across how much fun the fans are having, even at the expense of the visuals.

If you can forgive this one flaw then there is a lot to enjoy about C.O.C's Live Volume: The Movie and I would highly recommend it.",1317772800,,1917,4.667655786350148
7948473,5,B00005O6OE,I love this dvd.  I watch it at least once a week.  Pepper and crew are rocking as usual.  The video and audio quality is excellent!,1265241600,,132,4.0
7948474,5,B00005O6OE,Have seen COC 3 times live the last time 12 years ago. This DVD showcases them at the top of their game. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD and cut it up!!!!!!!!!!!,1264809600,,166,3.911764705882353
7948475,5,B00005O6OE,"The fact of having Corrosion of Conformity on DVD is reason enough to own this concert DVD.  Live Volume finds the long running (and long underrated) band performing in Detroit in April of 2001, and is an absolute must own for any C.O.C. fan.  While the mix could have been better, the band is showcased at their near best, although long time C.O.C. fans will have a hard time adjusting to seeing Jimmy Bower (Eyehategod and Down) behind the drums in place of original member Reed Mullin who had since departed from the band.  Getting to see the band perform favorites like ""Albatross"", ""Clean My Wounds"", ""Seven Days"", ""Wiseblood"", ""King of the Rotten"", ""Who's Got the Fire"", ""Vote With a Bullet"", and ""Shelter"" is a real treat, but I wish more songs would have been included, especially some of their older pre-""Deliverance"" material.  All that aside, you really can't go wrong with this package, and if your a huge C.O.C. fan than this is a must own.",1066694400,6,953,4.688622754491018
7948476,5,B00005O6OE,"Sure dirt merchants C.O.C. are a metal band, but in more of an old school 70's sense than anything new. That definitely plays to their strengths on such Sabbath inspried cuts as ""Albatross, ""Wiseblood"" and the Thin Lizzy influenced ""Clean My Wounds."" These and other songs, like the southern rock of ""Who's Got The Fire?"" sound so fresh and natural, they make you feel like it's 1975 all over again and Sabbath still rules(which they do anyway). Frontman Pepper Keenan shows he can sing and be nasty at the same time, sounding like James Hefield's long lost brother on ""Senor Limpio"" and ""Long Whip/Big America."" Guitarist Woody Weatherman does his best Toni Iommi, while keeping the band's trademark groove intact. This is real music, regardless of what kind you like. I'd recommend it to anyone, if you're looking for something to kick your ass.",1064448000,10,847,4.888888888888889
