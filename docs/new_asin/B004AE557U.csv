8420082,3,B004AE557U,"I really enjoyed the dance moves in this and love MaDonna Grimes' high energy - however, it is *very* confusing. This is not what I'd consider a Beginners dance workout. At. All. She goes through the moves fast, not allowing any time to slow down and actually instruct beginners on the foot and arm work. So unless you're already well versed in many of these steps, it's extremely difficult to follow along because you're never given the chance to master the foot work, then add arms, then put it together and then increase speed.

Really more for people with an already solid foundation in dance moves.",1456185600,,603,4.688679245283019

8420084,3,B004AE557U,"Yea, oh okay...I viewed it once, it wasn't exactly what I was looking for, I guess that's was on me for purchasing it after reading earlier reviews. I wanted, a DVD that would teach me original African dance steps, not just an African beat to dance steps.",1389830400,,255,4.446808510638298
8420085,3,B004AE557U,"This DVD is disappointing for those who watched Madonna's excellent work on FitTV.  It's labelled a beginner's workout, however, the host fails to go over each step slowly before picking up the pace - this was something she did on FitTV.  It's easy for those unfamiliar with Madonna's FitTV workouts to get confused or discouraged when trying to master the steps on these videos.  At the end of the Latin/Afro workout, Madonna and crew peform a dance routine.  What is the purpose of this?  This time should have been used to add to the workout - abominal work for example (as she did at end of FitTV workouts)or make a longer workout. If anyone made a copy of her FitTV workouts, I'd love to purchase a copy.",1302307200,3,709,4.551181102362205
8420086,2,B004AE557U,I am a big fan of MaDonna Grimes from Allstar Workouts but this video was very disappointing. It seemed as if this video was made for the dancers in the video to showcase thier hip hop skills. This could of been an okay cardio workout video if the routine was danced out a few more times.,1301270400,2,288,4.160714285714286
8420087,5,B004AE557U,"I LOVE THIS DVD!! I use it every morning before going to work. It is fun and a good workout. She cues the viewer and does a wonderful job of teaching the moves. Using her DVD in the morning before work really impacts how my day will flow. The reason I purchased the DVD was because FitTv is no longer focusing on fitness. FitTv was a big factor in making sure sure I worked out daily. In fact, I would easily do two hours daily of various dance, yoga, or kickboxing, etc. before the big programming change. I highly recommend this DVD and hope others will find it as much fun as well as a good cardio exercise as I do. I am glad I purchased it and Amazon's price was perfect.
Enjoy",1297468800,4,681,4.12781954887218
