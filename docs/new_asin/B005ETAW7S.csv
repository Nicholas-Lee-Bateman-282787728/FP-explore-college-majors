4667206,3,B005ETAW7S,"Well as is stated in another review it is nice to have this Francis movie for those of us who are true fans.  Her musical scenes are by far the best, Waiting For Billy is a very nice one with great shots of Connie.  The best thing about this movie is the transfer, they (WB) did a great job. THe color and clearity are top notch.  I enjoyed it after all these years. If you are a Connie fan so will you.",1315699200,2,403,3.8902439024390243
4667207,3,B005ETAW7S,"MGM in an attempt to cash in on the wildly successful ""Where The Boys Are"" three years later put Connie in this overly subplotted movie, losing Francis along the way. She was the bankable star in the aforementioned debut movie, as she is here, but isn't given much better treatment. In Where The Boys Are she sang the smash title and one other number, here she sings the hit title and 2 other songs. The co-stars take center stage in a silly love triangle, while Janis Paige as the wife of a Commander, only wishes for a stable home life and perhaps some children. Paige is the real pro in this movie. Again, the stars and especially Connie are saddled with a rather weak script. She was able to overcome this in her next movie where is was firmly showcased, but this does not happen in ""Follow The Boys"". The viewer will however, notice her professionalism when she is singing in front a large crowd at a wine festival in Italy (""Tonight's My Night"") which she does with remarkable ease, having sang before huge crowds on stage.

There are several scenes in the movie where she appears heavier. At the time the studio bosses put her on illegal diet drugs (she stayed hooked for 20 years and walked away from them cold turkey, remarkably without side-effects).

There is not much of a plot to go into except women called ""Sea Gals"" following the ships around the world where their mates or boyfriends are stationed. It is through this thin premise, that the writers added far too many inane subplots.

Outside of the title song, I wasn't very impressed with this movie. It does however have it's comic moments, all supplied by Francis.

If you're a fan you'll want this movie made on demand. It is remastered with a great transfer. If you're looking for a movie that is ""all"" Connie Francis, buy ""Looking For Love"" which is also available as a digitally remastered movie on demand.

4667209,3,B005ETAW7S,"Location scenery is nice, but Francis couldn't carry the movie. I think they may have been trying to cash in on the success of Where The Boys Are, but the cast and script really weren't up to snuff.",1469318400,,198,4.2368421052631575

4667213,5,B005ETAW7S,"The film is cute and if not taken seriously, the scenery is lovely and Connie is charming and of course, sings very well. All the songs are beautiful and showcase what fine talents she had, demonstrating what a lack of talent is evidenced in many others today...she should be a textbook for many ""wanna be"" female vocalists. In those days, you had to sell records on the basis of your voice, not shaking your booty and attempting falsetto tricks and there were no videos. People knew you from the cover of your records and an occasional TV appearance. To achieve a gold record, you had to sell a million copies, an event not easily attained. Today, everyone is given the epithet of ""Superstar"" but are they all worthy of this?
The film is innocent and apart from one singing scene in a nightgown (a ballad), there is absolutely no nudity...yet, it worked!",1427760000,3,855,4.631578947368421

4667225,5,B005ETAW7S,Follow The Boys is known as a Connie Francis film. She is the best part of it also.  She sings the theme Follow The Boys. At the time Connie was the number one female pop singer.  With four girls following their guys from port to port what could be better. The scenery around the French and Italian Riviera is gorgeous.
