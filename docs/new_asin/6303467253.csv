685520,5,6303467253,"Based on many positive reviews, I gave this movie a try for my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, & 5th grade music students.  They were transfixed on it, complaining loudly when we had to finish it over a few days (It is a full 98 minutes long.) because they didn't want it to quit!  The music, costumes, plot, etc. are top-quality, and I plan to use it in the future.  I will say that I think that some of the 2nd graders were a little young to appreciate it, so I'll limit it to 3rd grade and up in the future.  You will definitely not be disappointed in this movie.",1113782400,3,549,4.055555555555555
685521,5,6303467253,"I am a junior high choir director and general music teacher.  This film is excellent for use in class or at home.  Good message, musical references, and a story that even the too-cool-for-my-britches junior high students really get into.  Good for younger children, too--my 6-year old loves it, even though it's not a cartoon!  The film is well done, as is the singing and acting.  Excellent for a choir on non-singing days, as it reinforces proper singing posture and placement.",1095984000,2,479,4.9375

685886,5,6303467253,"Arrived earlier than expected - by two days! It was sealed, as well. We've watched twice and no skips or scratches.

The movie itself is my favorite of all time, and was purchased for me by my fiance for Vday. It's loosely based on a fairytale, emphasizing family values, morality, and making decisions by thinking them through instead of making a snap judgment then acting on what you think you know. Excellent family movie! No matter how young your kids are, this isn't inappropriate material for them. Whether it'll capture the attention of a young audience (my kids are 2 & 4 at this time) will heavily depend on the children's personalities and whether they're already sleepy. My kids loved it the first time, but haven't seen it again since, so I won't be able to help with that until they do.",1455580800,,799,4.626760563380282

685983,5,6303467253,This is an old movie but kind of a small take on The Phantom of the Opera for anyone who liked that movie. A young girl with a beautiful voice who is introduced to an older man in a mansion who's face is ugly. I won't spoil the rest.. but the movie is to die for! I've been watching it for 10+ years and it never gets old. The songs and music accompanying every scene are incredible and breathtaking.

Rigoletto is a family-friendly story with enchanting melodies. Joseph Paur, who plays the lead character of Mr. Ribaldi, has a fantastic voice which will stay with you for days. Filled with heart and humor, this uplifting fairytale will quickly become a family favorite.

686068,5,6303467253,"I watched this in sixth grade, when it was a vhs. I liked it then, and I'd forgotten about it.
Then, a couple years ago, I bought it again, and memories came back.
Now, though, I noticed things about it I didn't notice then. Why didn't the kids tell their parents about Mr. rebaldi, when he started being nice to them? Maybe no one would believe them. And the kids started the rumors in the first place. I know the movie was trying to show how hurtful rumors are, but it was still strange how the parents believed the kids. The only one who didn't was Bonnie's mother. Even when things started changing, no one seemed to notice who was giving them money.
My sister couldn't figure how the ending happened. I explained to her it was like Jesus, but she said, ""He's either alive or dead.""
The music is beautiful, and I can't wait to get the soundtrack. It's similar to Beauty and the Beast, and Phantom, but that's okay with me. I like how they all do their own singing.
The ending is a tear-jerker. It was sad how the person responsible finally said, ""Just hurt me."" I thought, "" Too late now.""
Is it perfect, no. But, for a family movie that teaches how horrible prejudice and gosip can be, it's pretty good.
There is one violent scene, parents should explain it to their kids. It fits in with the story.
I'm deliberately being vague, for people who haven't seen this. I don't like giving anything away, although it's pretty predictable.",1422921600,8,1437,4.446969696969697

The beast character has an amazing voice and there are all hidden suggestions of good values and morals throughout the entire movie. I use this with my middle school music classes. Once I get into the development of the plot the children really get into the movie, and we have great discussions. I only show G rated or music oriented movies in my classes this is one of my top films, especially for children who may not come from good solid family backgrounds, we can discuss good values and learn about each other and how to establish good friendships, and not be so prejudice in this world. The music totally relates as a young girl is learning how to sing from this master.

686138,5,6303467253,"Let just say that isn't based on the opera by verdi. it's completely different story & this the only movie I never saw as a little kid!
about a year ago i was on youtube under my reviewer name by someone who commented on the song called let me in (full version)sung by Tracy willams as gabriella (on the end credits!) & posted by The riddler.
Then aside from the suggestions clicked on the actually song with lyrics sung by Ivey lloyd & heard all the songs from yt user called hummingbird musican. the music was gorgeous!  but I wanted to find out more about this flim on wikipedia and they compaired this movie to three stories the phantom of the opera,beauty & the beast & the man without a face. i only knew two out three of the books it mentioned.
So i went & brought the soundtrack while leding a few other yt users to amazon.com! after having it then I wanted to buy the movie but was a bit hesitant because there some reviews that complain about dvd's picture quality. it took awhile to find which one to buy.
no fear when i've finally brought from the seller of feature flims. it came on Thursday of june 5th & there no flaws what so ever!
while giving me an invoice for other flims.
after watching the movie i thought to myself ""what a beautiful flim!"" also shouldn't be compaired to the book that wiki stated because it stands out on it's own for originality! although doesn't stop people for making references to it *laughs*
I want to thank hummingbird musican on youtube by letting me hear this music & the people who this made beautiful magical flim since 1993.
Oh one more thing...go & get this rigoletto on dvd now!",1416009600,,1630,4.37953795379538

686186,5,6303467253,"Rigoletto is a story reminiscent of the ""Beauty and the Beast"" fairy tale.  Set during the Great Depression in a small rural town, the story concerns a young woman, Bonnie Nelson, who longs to be noticed for her musical gifts.  Yet many only see her poor status.  When a mysterious stranger moves into town, people begin losing their homes.  The stranger's reclusive behavior immediately raises suspicions, and rumors circulate about the man's true identity.  When Bonnie's mother goes to plead for her family's security, she is offered a bargain: If Bonnie chooses to work in the man's house as his servant, their home will be spared.  Thus begins a tale of mystery and beauty as Bonnie's kindness melts the ice around the stranger's heart.  Is this stranger more than he seems? And, what will happen when children of the town begin to heal from their illnesses and infirmities.  The inevitable confrontation between the fearful townspeople and the disfigured stranger will expose the true beast and leave a lasting impact on a community that will never be the same.

This movie is profound in its frank examination of how our perceptions can so often be wrong and how rumors can poison lives.  It's also a lovely depiction of the restorative power of kindness and love.  It may be argued that some of the characters, (particularly Bonnie), are too perfect, but this is a fairy tale retelling, so that fact did not disturb me.
The acting is very good for the most part.  Joseph Por is phenomenal as Ribaldi, (the reclusive stranger), and his singing voice is outstanding, embodying the man's pain and loneliness.  The songs are memorable and truly compliment the plot.  My favorites are, ""The Curse,"" ""April Child,"" and ""The Melody Within.""
Please give this riveting and beautiful film a chance.  You will not be disappointed.  God bless you all.",1411430400,5,1847,4.909677419354839

This is a wonderful story of how the hard walls around a heart can be taken down when people can love someone through the tough, wounded, exterior. It makes one do some self reflection on what we each truly value. There is also a powerful message about the power of lies and the power of silence when very destructive actions are taken based on the absent or false information.  The fine singing by Joseph Paur I found inspirational and other songs spoke to the heart.",1405209600,,607,4.45945945945946

686246,5,6303467253,"I was given this movie on VHS a long time ago as a gift. SO glad to see it on DVD, as I no longer have a VHS player to watch it.

This continues to be one of my favorite movies. The story is very Beauty and the Beast-esque, with a few Biblical themes woven in. Can't say much more than that without giving away the climax of the plot, but think CS Lewis.

I will say, the acting at times isn't the best. It's clear most of the cast aren't seasoned actors. Then again, this isn't a glitzed-up Hollywood film to begin with. No cursing, no sex, no crude ""humor"", very little violence, and good morals! All that makes up for a little sub-par acting, Also, the music is simply beautiful, and Joseph Paur's voice is nothing short of brilliant.

If you're looking for a great film for your kids to watch without exposing them to Hollywood's special brand of entertainment, I can't recommend this one highly enough, or any of the other movies produced by Feature Films for Families. They were a staple of my childhood when I was growing up. Do yourselves and your children a favor, and make them a staple of theirs, as well.",1402272000,2,1116,4.330143540669856
686247,5,6303467253,I liked this movie because it was fun and mysterious. I love how the girl Bonnie saw good in Mr. Ribaldie and not the bad monster people assumed.

This is a story of love breaking down and overcoming ignorance, arrogance and ugliness. And all through the kindness of a teenage girl who learns to sing from the love within her own heart. The music is wonderful and you'll find yourself humming some of the tunes. Music and acting critics might critique the structure of the score and the quality of the acting. But for a family drama that your kids will love, this scores 5 stars on all levels.

686499,3,6303467253,"All right, so it's a good movie, pleasing overall -- but it's not all THAT good.  Others have praised good things about it, so here are a few reservations and ruminations, noted after a first viewing:

It has an unfortunate tendency toward moralizing rather than fully embodying the moral lesson in the story.

The main moral lesson seems to be about the value of seeing into the inner person.  Now this is good, but by itself, unqualified, it can be misleading.  Such insight is not common, and the film doesn't deal adequately with the corruption of our human nature.  Maybe what I want is for others to see me in the egocentric, distorted way I see myself.

There is quite a bit of violence in one scene.  Caution for some children.

It doesn't have the professional finish of a big budget movie with fine actors and perfection of detail.  In particular, many of the children were not convincing.

Sorry not to be more positive.  Comments welcome!",1354579200,3,950,4.656626506024097

I won't lie- some of the actors are sub-par, but some are really, really good. Joseph Paur's acting surprised me. He is phenomenal in his role, and perfectly cast I might add. The music... oh, the music. Rigoletto has one of the most gorgeous scores I've ever heard. Kudos to Kurt Bestor on that. Ivey Lloyd is good for her age. Her solos are sweet and pretty. Joseph Paur literally takes my breath away with ""The Curse"" and ""April Child."" His voice is so pure, so powerful, and just absolutely stunning. Overall, I just adore this movie.

The song that is taught to this child is haunting and beautiful. I've probably watched it 20 times since I got it as a VHS when it was first released.,1212364800,2,304,3.8412698412698414
686809,4,6303467253,"I find this film well done over-all. This is an independent film so the production quality is not glitzy Hollywood. The actors are not seasoned but their performances are credible and show honesty. The music is very good, much better than most main stream films. The confrontation, beating and later death of the title character and the following epiphany of the involved characters is very well done. This film doesn't do all the work for you, that is, you need to become reflective to get the entire impact of the film. The messages in this film are complex and presented well. These are very important and would serve as a good story to help children of PG age learn. This film is among the better films from the feature films for families catalog and I recommend this as a good family viewing.",1209600000,11,797,4.619718309859155
686810,2,6303467253,"Let me start by saying that the music is indeed beautiful.  The acting however is not.  The story is nothing new, very familiar territory, similar to Beauty and the Beast.  The biggest problem I have with this for young children (and I have other smaller problems) is the scene at the end where the mob beats Ribaldi to death.  It is very violent, the music is very intense, and entirely too much for anyone under 7.  I don't think talking about it afterwards lessens the impact of that hateful and violent of a crime playing out in front of their eyes.  I was very surprised at all the reviews that mention little children watching this.  If I was rating the music alone I would likely give it a 4, the movie however is poorly done.",1209168000,11,733,4.385185185185185

686812,5,6303467253,"Watched this movie all the time when I was younger.  Lost the VHS tape while moving so I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my sister.  She used to watch it all the time as well.  Acting is probably not the best, but there is some great music in this film, as well as a good story.  We love the film and are happy to have it on DVD.  Only down side is that it was a little expensive.  However, I do suggest this as a good family movie.",1199145600,,443,3.8131868131868134
686813,5,6303467253,"This is basically another version of Beauty and the Beast, with a few differences, the main one being that the hero and the heroine do not fall in love.

The story:-

A young girl called Bonnie goes to work for a man called Mr. Ribaldi, who has just bought her house. She soon discovers that, although Mr. Ribaldi can be very hurtful, he has a wonderful singing voice. As he teaches her to sing, all the children in the town get to know him, and discover that, underneath his disfigured face is a beautiful soul. But, feeding on rumors, the townspeoples hatred of Mr. Ribaldi grows..............

EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!!! Especially the message that this movie has; you should always try to look beyond the exterior of a person.

The music is absolutely WONDERFUL! One of the songs, which is called ""The Melody Within"", I sang in a concert last May. The guy who plays Mr. Ribaldi - WOW! WHAT AN AMAZING VOICE!!!!!!!",1191801600,14,943,4.696969696969697

when we moved away from our grandparents, we would rent Rigoletto from the library every time we went...

It's family friendly, it has some humor, and most of all, it has a message that leaves a smile and a tear at the end of the movie.
