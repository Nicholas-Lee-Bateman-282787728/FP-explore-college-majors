8602340,5,B000LPR6EW,"If you have stumbled on this DVD, then you must have at least some interest in Russian pop music.  This double-sided DVD collection of One Hundred performance videos is an excellent way to uncover songs and artists that are unfamiliar to most of us outside Russia or Ukraine.  If the world had not been fabricated with so many Curtains and Walls, these songs would be well known to all of us.  There are several videos of Larisa Dolina and Grigoriy Leps that hint at what we have been missing the past few decades.  Plus there are new songs by Maksim, Sogdiana, and of course Valeriy Meladze.  I'm really happy I discovered this collection. Don't understand Russian?  Do some research, or call on a Russian-speaking friend.  But open up this treasure chest.",1240531200,,757,4.732824427480916
