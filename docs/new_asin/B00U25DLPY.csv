8703949,4,B00U25DLPY,"I wrote and directed one of the films on here. It was my first film. In retrospect, was it high art? No. Was it a good film? Not really. But I learned a lot and we all had a lot of fun making the movie. It got me my start in the industry, and I'm still plugging away at it. Whenever anyone asks me where I went to film school, I reply, ""The University of DELIRIUM"".",1463356800,4,365,3.8157894736842106
8703950,1,B00U25DLPY,"Capitalizing on the demand for post apocalyptic films with the words ""Road"" or ""Fury"" being in the title, we have this 5 movie collection, carefully selected from films that can't be sold on their own. These are 5 poorly made films with bad acting and sound. You might find some cheese value, but for the most part you will be fast forwarding through garbage.

8703951,1,B00U25DLPY,"I typically like post-apocalyptic films so I purchased this from the discount bin at my local Wally world.
It is dreadful! All but two of the movies look like they were hand filmed. With one movie nearly unwatchable due to the low quality. It looks like these movies were ripped from low quality Youtube videos. I would not recommend this purchase to ANYONE!",1446336000,2,358,4.698412698412699
