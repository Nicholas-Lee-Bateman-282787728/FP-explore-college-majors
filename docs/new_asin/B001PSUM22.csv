3761141,5,B001PSUM22,I think this aime was good. Story line was good. The ending was good to but it was not what i expected.,1358380800,,103,3.727272727272727
3761142,4,B001PSUM22,"Tomozazu is a lazy high school slacker and a self-admitted pervert. On his 16th birthday he falls asleep and ends up in a crazy dream world. There are lots of hot girls fighting monsters. He joins them to fight the monsters that are trying to enter the real world. As it turns out all the girls that he meets in the dream world either live with him or go to school with him. This may be a good chance for Tomokazu to score. He might just get lucky.

The story is pretty flimsy. I honestly can't remember all the details of the plot, but this anime is still a pretty solid title I think. I really love animes with a great emotional story, but it's fun to watch something just for fun and laughs. The production quality of this anime is pretty good. The animation and voice acting is good. If you want to laugh and enjoy yourself this anime id for you, but if you're after a deep story then look at something else. As far as being pure and simple fun is concerned, Yumeria has it covered.",1350777600,,986,4.216931216931217
3761143,3,B001PSUM22,"I watched this after seeing the Tenchi Muyo series, i really hoped there would be some intense love interest moments and, or some fan service, and IT did just that and then some. But let me tell you where it went wrong and where it went right.

WARNING Partial SPOILERS(it will not reveal everything technically)
Did right:

1.put emotional moments of fan service and love interest, but did it simotaniously, something i never have seen from a few anime's.

2. Also it has tons of funny moments and you feel like your getting to know the characters.

3. The graphics, and story are extremely detailed even if it was rushed a bit and relied more on those qualities if anything.

4. The plot was excellent it kind of reminded me of Tenchi Muyo the way the girls meet up with Tomokazu unexpecedly, and they are forced on a strange mission in the dream world against the Faydooms.

What it did wrong.

1. Some moments the plot felt rushed and i felt like i did not know how Tomokazu's life was while his mom died and Nana-sa took him in, it only showed glimpses i would have liked that to be the beginning and settle a bit into that dream plot.

2. The ending, to me call me a doomsday or a pessemistic person, but i believe that the original change of fate should have not braught his mom back to life for Tomokazu could change fate but not PAST fate which is a PLOTHOLE. But instead have life where Mone,Mazuki,Nanasay was still with Tomokazu like originally and Kayou left home and have Mone do something crazy and have that be the ending. Or atleast show if Tomokazu's love interest lies, and leave the ending on that note, and create another season dedicated to living in a crowded household.

3. There are some plotholes in this series, and i will say that at first i can stand Mone saying her name like a Pokemon, but there is kind of no clear definition of why she became that way.

4. Like the Tenchi Muyo thing i did mention earlyer, it did not provide a valid conclusion. In my mind i asked myself ""Do any of the characters who were involved in the final dream mission remember them now or is it erased"". And plus i felt like they could have done 4 episodes more on the faydoom plot, and maybe 7 on the love interests and learning more about the characters and the relationship with Tomokazu.

Conclusion.

I say buy it, because it is worth the money right now under the 20 dollar mark. I really hope the creators can take my advice maybe redo some scenes, and make more episodes based on these concepts or ideas, because if they did, trust me this would probably on top of the Harem market. I know it is on top, but it would clear up every plothole, and make it close to the Tenchi Series(which i consider a god of the Harem style universe)",1281744000,,2748,4.366666666666666
3761144,3,B001PSUM22,"I could see this appealing to a young (teenage male) audience.

I had seen some pretty mediocre reviews for this online at other sites. Then I saw some great reviews here and decided to buy it...
I've been betrayed by the reviews here a couple times... and I thought this would be different but it wasn't.

It isn't remarkable... there is plenty of fan service... but this holds little else of value in my opinion.

It is pretty middle of the road anime. When it was over my wife and I were not excited to see a follow up if there is one...

So here is my breakdown:

1) The art: Pretty average. It reminds me of stuff you would see from a low budget project. Compared to the cover art it lacks considerably. The production quality isn't the highest I've seen when it comes to the art.

2) The audio: I really enjoy bubbly anime soundtracks so I found that to be the best part of this anime. The audio is fun and playful so I really liked it... The audio is why I bumped this from 2 stars to 3.

3) The Boxset: Again pretty average the back particularly suggests some fan service and this does well in that department. The fan service isn't so ""in your face"" that you are offended but they lay it on pretty thick. The box is pretty standard. It does however look good in your collection.

4) The Characters: The depth in the character development is done pretty well. But it follows the standard harem anime formula. One Lolita-type, One Mature and Sexy, One very young and playful, and two that you are closer to being at odds for the affection of the target male.

They do make some effort to give you the back story for each character and that part is done pretty well... again another one of those items pushing this from 2 stars to 3.

Each of the female characters has a unique characteristic that make them attractive in their own way. One is soft spoken and needs the ""night in shining armor"". While the other plays out a motherly roll. Etc... Etc... They all have characteristics that appeal to men in one way or another.

The plot and story are pretty much there to showcase the girls... and there are some plot twists that are obvious from the moment you start watching the first disc. REALLY obvious plot twists... it is almost insulting to your intelligence.

Again this isn't meant to challenge your intellect or bring any new paradigms to the anime viewer... it simply is very average work.

Not bad... not good...

Just OK.",1247616000,4,2439,4.415178571428571
3761145,4,B001PSUM22,"After finishing up the entire series yesterday, I felt funding for the show ran out because the ending comes at you so fast, you don't even realize it's over.

This has a major drawback, in that character development suffers. There were so many questions left to answer (how was regeneration accomplished through decades? Why Noneko? How did ""they"" (spoiler free) split at the end?)

This series should have been 26+ episodes as the storyline was definitely creative to do so. Despite the extremely short series, it's entertaining to watch.

For those with children 13 or younger, the sexual innuendo in the show may not be suitable for them. No nudity, but definitely contains scantily clad teenage girls (Mone and Noneko are young and the ""lolita"" references are common in the show).

For those who don't like ""annoying"" characters, Mone only says ""Mone"" throughout the entire series. That ended up annoying after the first 10 minutes of the show. If you can get past this, enjoy the episodes.",1233532800,2,995,4.940119760479042
3761146,4,B001PSUM22,"I won't repeat the storyline. The animation is good and the characterization is as well. (Even if a little generic). Worth watching in either the dubbed or the subtitled version. Dubbing is very good, keeping the spirit and humor of the series. I'll say it's not spectacular, but it is above average. Voice acting is excellent, especially ""Mone"" who manages to convey her meaning throughout the series with only the word mone as dialog. It was worth the price.",1202428800,6,460,4.8354430379746836

The art work is very good and the story arc is not bad. I would have appreciated better development of the story however. I have the feeling that they tried to include every thing in to short a space and it would have benifited from more or longer episodes. Overall I would recomend it as an evenings pleasant entertainment.",1199059200,4,566,6.363636363636363
3761148,5,B001PSUM22,"Yumeria is a 12 episode (300+ minutes) series that follows Tomokazu Mikori, your basic loser who admits that he is a pervert. On his 16th birthday, he falls asleep, only to enter a world where he meets Mone, a young girl who will alter past and future events. It is now up to Tomokazu to save those he cares about from the Faydoom, evil creations in the dream world that are trying to invade the waking world. If he fails, all will be lost and the future devastated. Whats a 16 year old, perverted-loser to do?

The series was pretty good and I found that the trailor that I viewed before I bought it didn't do the series justice. Yes, Tomokazu is a pervert in the series, but not to the extent that the trailor put him as, being as some people understandably don't like perverts. The story also reminded me somewhat of the Matrix in that it spans two worlds, where an event in one will affect the other. This is also one of those series where you have to watch in order to understand everything that is going on and as this story style, as previous reviewer put, ""sucks you in"". Even with a complex storyline, the pieces do fit in an easy to understand way (once you see it), like with me I caught myself saying ""Oh that's why so and so did such and such"". The story also makes indirect, outside references to other anime series such as Sailor Moon and Sister Princess, these two being ones that I could pick out right away.

Character design and special affect design was outstanding. I would go as far as to say that the people who worked on these affects are some of the best, if not the greatest, from what I've seen so far. The characters were cute, and if not, then visually appealing in that they catch your eye. The designers who worked on the characters also deserve some recognition because I could not find one character, and this includes stand-in characters, that did not look fantastic.

Keep in mind that the series does focus around a kid that is a bit of a pervert so there are some sexual references and hardly any nudity, if you  would consider these few parts nudity. As with other series that I've seen that involve such topics, it works with the series and just adds to the comedy.

Overall, the series was filled with laugher(alot of it I might add)and jaw dropping action that literally made me keep watching. As I said with the Maburaho review, this is another series that could have been made longer because the story is so good and detailed that people would have kept watching. For anyone that is looking for another addition to their collection or beginning a collection, this is a must have. Do not waste time in trying to get it.",1176854400,29,2661,4.422448979591837
