4699373,5,B005HF4WMU,"Yep, Gold fans, this is the one to buy.  Widescreen, great sound, and scenes we've not had on other releases. The only (slight) drawback is it is not remastered, but given the shoddy history of past releases, this is a minor point.  Nothing in the world like Gold...",1331251200,2,266,4.520833333333333
4699374,4,B005HF4WMU,"The movie is crystal clear on this disc.  Great movie with a nice soundtrack, too.  Beautiful shots of the South African countryside.  They mixed in a love story with the plot.  This is one of Moore's best pictures, dealing with a serious topic (mine operations); You see how the mine works.  It is amazing to see all the stunt work - no fancy computer/fake stuff in those days (1974).  Perfect time to view the movie, given all the talk about gold and prices these days.  Just good, solid acting.  Recommended!",1315267200,8,511,4.6

4699395,2,B005HF4WMU,"Screened because it's a Prime Freebie. You'd be surprised at the gems one finds sifting through the detritus of the 70s.

Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.

The plot centers around the largest South African gold mine, one that produces one-third of all the precious metal unearthed in a given calendar year.

A sinister group of international investors are looking to gain maximum profit by manipulating the commodities market. How? By destroying the mine and cutting off the world's supply. Conversely, stocks in the companies they've quietly bought will rocket toward new heights when the bad news hits the global economies. That their cold-blooded plan also means the deaths of a thousand miners? The cost of doing business.

Things nearly go awry when their chosen inside man is killed early in the process. Their replacement? Playboy Roderick Slater, aka Roger Moore, who unwittingly plays into the hands of the group. A new title, hefty pay raise, and his new-found girlfriend have blinded him to the devious plot.

Does our hero have a plan to stop the nefarious profiteers?

Overly long at nearly two hours, this could've been easily trimmed to ninety-minutes and delivered a tighter product. The characters weren't particular interesting, made up of cardboard cutouts - essentially sabotaging the seed of a good idea. The cast performances were adequate and unremarkable.

Interestingly, this film production also qualifies as one of the then-commonplace ""disaster"" themed flicks which were the 'zombie movies' of the 1970s. So I enjoyed the gold mining bits - particularly that last action sequence. Very engaging. But it was such little payoff for this lengthy run of celluloid.

Movie Note:

- Not sure if this was a real-life inspiration, but less than a decade later, two of the then-wealthiest men in the world, The Hunt Brothers, attempted a similar fiscal coup d'etat by cornering the silver market.

It failed miserably and the Hunts were, ironically, legally hunted by government agencies and investor funds for years afterward.",1414800000,,2052,5.2097264437689965

4699397,5,B005HF4WMU,"Don't ask why this is the all-time favorite movie of a serious film student. All that matters here is that, after decades (!) of trying to find a complete, clean copy, this is the version to buy. In 1987, I taped a cleaner copy off late-night television than most of the horrendously edited, discolored, poorly processed, unintelligible slop that's been available on VHS and --incredibly-- DVD.

This copy is unedited, and pristine. The images are sharp; the colors pop; the sound is perfect. Even in the dim light of the mines, you can see all the action clearly. Kudos to the digital remastering folks.

And, man, that Moore knew how to rock a suntan.",1394841600,,653,4.719298245614035
4699398,5,B005HF4WMU,"With its star, director, and crew being alumni of the Bond series this had the feel of a James Bond film, and a much better one than that years effort ""Man With The Golden Gun.""  As for the confusion over the aspect ratio, this DVD will only give you the widescreen ratio on an HDTV.  If you watch it on an old analog TV it is squeezed in to 1:85 and the image is distorted.  If you will be watching on HDTV then this is an excellent product.",1385942400,3,442,4.0
4699399,2,B005HF4WMU,"Sometimes we tend to romanticize our memories of a film we saw a long time ago. I saw GOLD when it originally came out,  and thought it was really good. The movie has been on my ""want list"" for a long long time, and I was never able to get a copy until just recently. Finally this copy came out, in widescreen, which is essential for the film, and I was...a bit let down. The main plot, dealing with problems with the gold mine and a plot to sabotage it so that some ""fat cat"" rich guys can get even richer, makes for a suspenseful story. The problem is that there is a subplot involving an affair between mine manager Roger Moore and the mine owners daughter, Susannah York , which slows the film down every time it comes to that. The annoying ""love scenes"" between the two are really boring and very 1970-ish, and they keep popping up, at least 3 times during the movie.
For me, the most interesting and likeable character in the film is one of the miners, ""Big King"", as played by South African (?) actor Simon Sabela. There should have been more about him in the movie. Susannah York's character is a total bore, and has wayyyy too much screen time.  What can I recommend about this film? There's some good action scenes and a superb score by Elmer Bernstein. Otherwise, I instead recommend reading the original novel by Wilbur Smith.",1380412800,,1338,4.412955465587045
4699400,5,B005HF4WMU,"Gold is a 1974 thriller film starring Roger Moore and Susannah York. It was based on the 1970 novel Gold Mine by Wilbur Smith. Moore plays Rod Slater, General Manager of a South African gold mine, who is instructed by his boss Steyner (Bradford Dillman)to break through an underground dike into what he is told is a rich seam of gold. Meanwhile he falls in love with Steyner's wife Terry, played by York. The film was only released as part of a double bill in the United States.

The film begins with a tunnel collapse at the Sonderditch mine, in a scene that establishes the courage of Slater and his chief miner, 'Big King', and the bond of trust between them. This is contrasted with the contempt with which some other white managers treat the black miners. It is soon revealed that the collapse was no accident, but part of a plan by a London-based criminal syndicate, which includes the mine-owner's son-in-law Manfred Steyner, to destroy the mine so that the syndicate members can profit from share-dealing. This will be done by drilling through a deep underground wall or 'dike' which is all that prevents an adjacent reservoir of water from flooding the mine.

The mine's General Manager, an accomplice in the plot, was killed in the tunnel collapse. Steyner interviews Slater, who at this stage is Underground Manager, for the now vacant post of General Manager, although the mine owner has another candidate in mind. At this point, Slater first meets Steyner's wife Terry and is attracted to her, but she does not return his interest. However, Steyner arranges for them to meet again, in the hope that Terry will influence her grandfather, the mine owner, in Slater's favor. The plan works, with two consequences: Slater becomes General Manager, and he and Terry start a love affair. Slater, unaware of the criminal plan, agrees to carry out the drilling but is cautious enough to plant a safety charge that will block the tunnel in case of a water leak. Steyner knows that Slater is having an affair with his wife, but allows it to continue because it will keep Slater away from the mine, so that the safety charge can be disabled without his knowledge.

While Slater and Terry are holidaying together, the final breach is made in the underground dike and the mine begins to flood, trapping a thousand workers. Slater hears of the disaster on the radio news, and flies with Terry back to the mine. There is a tense scene in which Slater and Big King descend the mine, amidst rising flood waters, to repair the safety charge. They succeed, but only because Big King sacrifices his own life to detonate the charge, letting Slater escape. Meanwhile, Steyner is murdered by Marais, one of his accomplices, after they hear on the radio that their plan has unravelled,Marais also crashes and kills himself. This conveniently leaves Terry free to continue her relationship with Slater, as the film ends.

Bath tub scene between Roger Moore and Susannah York is scintillating. The 70's music score is reminiscent of old times and of the 'disco era'. An interesting film, especially if you love Roger Moore movies. And what red-blooded female does not? Enjoy..... And may your dreams be filled with Roger Moore tonight....",1378252800,,3224,4.824593128390597

It is not Close-Captioned for the Hearing-Impaired.

A major disappointment -- although it is indeed the ""Widescreen Version"", it has not been correctly letter-boxed. It should be actual wide-screen (that is, 2:35 to 1).
It is not. It is ""only"" 1:85 to 1. This is, to me, an absolute major disappointment. I have kept it only because I am a big Roger Moore fan; and I grew up in South Africa.",1348790400,6,468,4.306818181818182

8472923,2,B005HF4WMU,"Bloated and dull adventure, if that's even the right genre, about a mining engineer (Roger Moore--phoning it in) who is given a promotion by his bosses, not realizing that he's an expendable part of a plot to flood the gold mine with water, reducing the world's gold supply and sending the value of gold skyrocketing.

This one is extremely slow, wastes lots of screen time on a not at all interesting romance between Roger Moore and Susannah York (who is the wife of Moore's boss, the man behind the plot) and is paced like a movie from the 1970's when people either had longer attention spans or were more indulgent of very slow films, depending on how you want to look at it.  Gold is mostly a bore, and unless you are really into Roger Moore there's little reason to sit through it.

James Bond fans might be interested in the fact that future Bond director John Glen (For Your Eyes Only; Licence to Kill) is the second unit director and was clearly responsible for a late sequence where one of the villains tries to kill someone with his automobile.  The scene is not only kind of exciting, but it feels like it was inserted from a different far more lively film.

Gold turns into something of a disaster movie (a very popular genre at the time) during the last 20 minutes as the mine is flooded and Moore tries to navigate his way against the racing water to fix the severed connection on some explosives that will seal off the mine.  So if you manage to sit through the first 90 minutes of the film there is eventually some action, but it seems to take forever to actually get to it.

Fans of a certain kind of 1970's film (The Cassandra Crossing; Avalanche Express; Bear Island) might enjoy Gold but most people will likely find it too slow by contemporary standards.",1478131200,,1775,4.4937888198757765
