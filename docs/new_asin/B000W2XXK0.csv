8221116,5,B000W2XXK0,My 10 month old daughter loves the video.  She tries to imitate the sounds coming from the vidoe and is really engaged in the visual interaction.  She watches it daily and never gets bored of what's on the video.  I recommend this to any child that is ready to learn.,1201737600,,267,4.3
8221117,5,B000W2XXK0,"My 22-month-old son really enjoys this video--he asks for it every day.  The video clips are entertaining, he loves watching the kids, and after viewing it 3 or 4 times, he was already repeating back the sounds.  If you enjoy Baby Einstein videos for your toddler, then you are sure to like Speech Parade.",1195603200,,305,4.62962962962963
8221118,5,B000W2XXK0,"Although I got this DVD because my son needed speech therapy, this is a great video for all little ones learning to talk! It is a fun and exciting 30 minutes that makes your child join in without thinking about it. I recommend watching it with your little one(s) and joining in yourself - that was all my son needed to start talking along. He began using what he learned in the video in every day experiences, such as seeing a truck in traffic and yelling out, ""Twuck! Bbbrrrrrrrmmmm!"" Get this video and watch your child's speech take off! (Great gift idea, too. All of my nieces and nephews have recieved it and many friends' little ones, too.)",1190937600,,646,4.483050847457627
