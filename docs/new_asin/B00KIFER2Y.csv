6429835,5,B00KIFER2Y,Great movie!,1419638400,2,12,5.5
6429836,5,B00KIFER2Y,"A bit of a slow start, but things take off quickly and Lauren Lee Smith is the perfect actress to play the part of Grace, the estranged daughter of a legendary filmmaker who has recently died. When she decides to take on the challenge of creating a retrospective showing of his works (never mind that she has previously never watched even one of his films!), she will find her life mesmerized by her father's various movies which she finally gets to see. And the ""expert"" which she hires to oversee the film festival will become one more problem to deal with, after one of her father's films causes her to decide to try a wild tryst with him (did I mention that she is married?)

A great date movie, but perhaps better if it's not your ""first"" date!",1406592000,5,749,4.427536231884058
8659225,3,B00KIFER2Y,"The acting was good. But, the movie itself was a bit slow& slightly depressing. The only thing that kept me interested was how themain character was going to do her father's memorandum.",1489017600,,185,4.8125
8659226,4,B00KIFER2Y,"Enjoyed this movie very much. Loved the character and her development and search. Lauren Lee Smith is a pleasure to watch, fresh, beautiful and very good at her craft. Her acting is admirable Jennifer Beals is one of my all time favorites, any time I get to see her is like sunshine..",1474675200,,284,4.480769230769231
8659227,4,B00KIFER2Y,"Was not real sure what to expect but I was very interested as to the plot of the movie. I enjoyed the movie. I love Jennifer Beals in anything she does, and Lauren Lee Smith did a fantastic job in her role. She has come a long way from The L Word which I liked her. Great movie.",1464048000,,278,3.810344827586207

8659229,5,B00KIFER2Y,It is an exciting movie. I have never seen a film with LLS I didn't like a whole lot.,1454371200,,85,3.526315789473684
8659230,2,B00KIFER2Y,"Unfortunately, it unfolds at a glacial ""indie"" pace..so slow that it's hard even to stay focused on what's going on. We couldn't stay with it.",1436400000,,142,4.72

8659234,1,B00KIFER2Y,"All I can say is that the people who gave this film a 5 Star Rating must be easily entertained! If you have a more discriminating taste, you may find the rest of my review here helpful. I didn't find anything likeable about this movie. It seemed I spent more time searching for the Fast Advance Button on my remote control than watching this one. If you enjoy watching someone brush their teeth, chop vegetables, lie on the sofa watching movies, have an extramarital affair, and other such meaningless filler, then maybe you'll see some redeeming value in this film. Just another very weak film in the Amazon Prime Offerings....",1428192000,5,628,4.718181818181818
