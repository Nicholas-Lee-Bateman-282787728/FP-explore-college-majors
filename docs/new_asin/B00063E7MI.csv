Another reviewer mentioned that DVPress is defunct.  It is, and I agree that this product should not be sold.  Buy a book instead.",1151366400,3,263,4.531914893617022
8037983,1,B00063E7MI,"If you can fight through the boredom of listening to someone read their own book for six hours , a small bit of useful information. the web site for dvpress is inactive and all attempts to reach them for the promised additional materials are in vain. Don't waste your time or money. Amazon should not carry these titles if the place is off-line or out of business.",1126137600,9,364,4.447761194029851
8037984,5,B00063E7MI,"Before I bought and watched this DVD, I knew nothing about writing Javascript. Harold Davis is quite knowledgeable and brought a succinct and informative presentation forward. The information was concise and well-presented. For those of us whom had no prior knowledge of Java, it was a very good introduction into the world of Javascript. Production values were good and I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent with Mr. Davis. Thank you Harold and DV Press for your good work.",1118620800,3,471,5.051282051282051
