3781620,5,B001RXDM2M,They cancel a show because it has bad ratings but they put it on the least watched night on television!! So what do they expect?  I am so sick of these executives cancelling good shows without truly giving them a chance.,1244419200,2,220,4.365853658536586
3781621,5,B001RXDM2M,I was terribly sad when Crusoe was cancelled. It is amazingly well done... fantastic writing and acting. I wish we could have seen more! I am surely going to buy this in a couple days when it comes out.,1243209600,4,202,4.205128205128205
3781622,4,B001RXDM2M,"I loved this show! I wasn't sure how they could pull it off with just two people, or if it would sink into a Gilligan's Island scenario with people splashing onto the island and then leaving without them.  It actually far surpassed my expectations. There are complete episodes with just the two main characters and there are episodes with the outsiders and natives  that find their way to the area of Crusoe's island. Glad to report it never feels forced. The action is exciting and tense, the relationships are very sensitive, and the cinematography is amazing! I didn't give 5 stars only because any time there was a flashback scene away from the island I found myself a little confused with all the backstory. Although the final episodes do a great job of bringing the characters back home into the story, fully realized.
I am very sad this is all we are going to get from this. But for me,the final episode has a satisfying ending anyways.",1241913600,2,943,4.640718562874252
3781623,4,B001RXDM2M,"Robinson Crusoe (Philip Winchester) has had a hard life.  Picking the wrong side of the insurrection against the King of England, he had to flee to the colonies for his life, leaving his wife Susannah (Anna Walton) and their kids in the hands of trusted family friend Jeremiah Blackthorn (Sam Neill).  But then fate deals him an even worse hand when he is shipwreck on a deserted island with only Friday (Tongai Arnold Chirisa) as a companion.  Together, the two build a friendship while fighting to survive on the island among pirates, natives, and nature.

But back in England, things aren't all they seem.  In a series of flashes, we learn Crusoe's back story and what is currently happening to those he loves in England.  If Crusoe and Friday ever get off the island, what will be waiting for them in England?

I'll admit I've never read the original novel, but I had to tune in to this modern day take on the classic story.  Now what do I mean by modern day take?  While the story is set in the late 1700's, some of the attitudes are modern.  Most noticeably, I seriously doubt that the Crusoe of the novel treats Friday as his equal the way he does here.  Do I mind the more modern sensibilities?  Not in the slightest.  In fact, the strong bond between Crusoe and Friday is one of the reasons I kept tuning in.

Honestly, the show struggled a little in the beginning to capture my interest.  I'd watch an episode, enjoy it, but often forget when it was coming back.  Thanks to my DVR, I caught them all.  As the series grew, things developed into a tight unit that really made the wait between the last few episodes hard.  While the ending wasn't what I hoped it would be, it did leave me satisfied and willing to imagine my own ending for the characters.

The show was incredible to look at.  Everything was lavishly constructed to recreate the time period.  England looked amazing.  And the island was so much fun.  The tree house alone made me smile each week.  And we can't leave out all the inventions that Crusoe and Friday had.  Okay, so it stretched credibility a little, but it was fun.

The acting was great here as well.  In fact, it was one thing that kept me coming back to the series.

I'm still unclear whether this was really intended to be a limited series or not, but these 13 episodes are well worth getting to enjoy over and over again.",1241481600,5,2363,4.445221445221446
3781624,5,B001RXDM2M,Crusoe is one of the best series I've ever seen.  Too bad NBC didn't have enough sense to keep it in a good time slot and properly support it.  I'll be ordering the DVD from Amazon. 13 episodes of a great series is worth buying and the price is more than fair.,1239321600,6,260,3.980769230769231
3781625,4,B001RXDM2M,"I probably would have rated it 4.5 stars but no real way to do such.  I watch alot of tv and was skeptical and curious about this show.  Bottomline, they pulled it off brilliantly.  The actors were great and the production of the show (flashback, tie in of characters, etc) is nicely done. Unfortunately they did cancel it but they wrapped things up so it turns this into a nice mini-series.  Definitely something for everyone (all memebers of the family).",1235692800,,456,4.6625
3781626,5,B001RXDM2M,"Strong characters, high adventure, a beautiful backdrop, appropriate flashbacks, historical value...this show is a gem.  What a refreshing departure from the usual network fare of reality shows and crime dramas.  And how often does a modern TV show or movie present a lead character who doesn't have a dark side, but has total integrity and honor.  Winchester's protrayal of Crusoe is admirable, as is the character himself.  Can't say enough good about this show.  And I agree with those who'd like to see a movie made to tie up the loose ends at the end of season 1.  Anyway...bravo Crusoe!",1235260800,65,592,4.87
3781627,5,B001RXDM2M,"I just stumbled upon this show when it was on TV and was lucky enough to see it from the very first episode all the way through (thanks to Tivo -- it wasn't easy to find it otherwise with all of the scheduling changes it went through). I am so happy to see that it is being released on DVD! It will be fun to watch it again. If you haven't seen this show, or if you missed some of the episodes, I highly recommend it. It's a lot of fun and a great family show too. I hope the DVD set includes some extras not seen on TV. It would be great if they made some kind of movie to tie up everything not resolved in the series. Or, continuing the series to another season would be even better!",1235174400,36,685,3.9
3781628,5,B001RXDM2M,Crusoe is the best and I will it continued I was so dissapointed when it was cancelled and I can't wait to purchase it was so action packed and kept you on your feet I am so mad at NBC for canceling it on its 13th episode it would have made a great show if it was continued even better than Heroes I never watch anything on NBC because most if not all the shows are really stupid but this show caught my eye and I looked forward to this show every week because it made me come back for more. I give this show 5 stars.,1234742400,7,517,3.8411214953271027

3781648,5,B001RXDM2M,"This is a wonderful, if fantastical, reimagination of the story of Robinson Crusoe.  I watched it on television when it was in prime time and was pretty devastated when it was cancelled after one season (or maybe in the middle of the season?)  The relationship between Crusoe and Friday is delightful and equal, and there's quite a bit of social commentary about race and status, as well as an interesting overview of some of the issues facing England at that time.  Better, I was able to watch this with my 9 year old son and, though there are a couple of scary/rough moments, we both delighted in its appropriateness and fun, adventurous spirit.  I can't say how much I love Philip WInchester and Tongayi Chirisa- both lovely to look at and wonderful actors.  Sam Neill is also terrific and chilling.  Glad I ordered this and will watch it several times before passing it on to my nephews.",1445040000,,891,4.643312101910828

3781694,5,B001RXDM2M,"NBC's Crusoe is a wonderful series based on Daniel Defoe's original work. NBC took some liberties with the original source material and what viewers ended up with was an action packed 18th century Castaway meets Macguyver. The show begins after Friday and Crusoe have been living together for a few years and has frequent flashbacks to Crusoe's life in London before he was shipwrecked and cuts to what his family, including his wife and children (yes they did take extreme liberties here) are doing without him.
  The show is filled with pirates, buried treasure, intrigue, betrayal, and suspense. The acting is superb. Philip Winchester is excellent as Crusoe. Sam Neil and Sean Bean also appear in the show. The series comes with a copy of the book. While the book is vastly different from the series I would highly recommend reading it.
  Another wonderful aspect about the show is that it is family friendly. While there may be some scenes that could be too intense for five year olds, the violence is fairly mild. Yet, the storylines are excellent you can watch this with anyone and enjoy.",1408579200,,1095,4.839572192513369

3781724,5,B001RXDM2M,This is a very good watch.  So sorry it was not on TV longer;  I never saw it as a TV program when it was running.  I wonder if it would have made a better mini series.  The acting is very good and the scenery is wonderful.  Maybe it was too costly to produce. We love it.,1404950400,,272,3.7017543859649122

3781726,5,B001RXDM2M,I thought this show was very well done. It was refreshing to see something different from usual cop shows or situation comedies. I felt it was very entertaining. Very nice scenery too.  It's too bad these were the only shows produced.,1401494400,,234,4.7073170731707314

3781733,4,B001RXDM2M,"I like TV mini-series because they are not heavy drama, although I must admit that this is a rather ""bloodless"" version.  But there are detials that just won't fly after having read the book and seen the 1997 film version ""Robinson Crusoe"" (Pierce Brosnan).  First and foremost [1] this Robinson always has a clean fresh shirt to wear every day, no rags after six years on a deserted island, yet in the original story and the 1997 movie based upon it, Robinson's clothes were reduced to rags and he was forced to make clothing from animal skins. [2] His abode in the book was a cave surrounded by a high stockade fence.  In this series he lives in a tree-house that is almost identical to Disney's film ""Swiss Family Robinson"" (1960). [3] Friday's character in this version or series presents him as a highly-education man (as in Oxford University), no tattoos, or bones, and hair that any civilized barbershop would create with a regular haircut.  In the book and the 1997 film he is presented as intended by Defoe, i.e., a savage tribesman who eventually speaks in broken English, has long hair, tattoos, and even a bone in his nose. [4] In the book and the 1997 film the island they live on is visited only by a cannibalistic tribe who use it as a place of human sacrifice. Yet in this TV series, there are pirates, Spanish pirate-hunters, cannibals, an insane English castaway, mad wild dogs, women, mutineers, and even members of his family come from England to kill him. But .... despite all these inaccuracies, the writers have written several plots and strung these together in such a way that it is enjoyable to watch, even fun. The flashbacks are annoying but necessary because this series does not follow the book 85% of the time.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting good, and the period details, i.e., weapons, clothing, ships, etc. very well done.  I will say this in conclusion, if I didn't really like it, I would not have watched the entire series three times in less than two weeks.  So that speaks volumes.",1390867200,3,2029,4.666666666666667
3781743,5,B001RXDM2M,"I could easily watch the series again and again.

3781745,5,B001RXDM2M,"This series far surpassed what I expected. Extremely well done, likable characters, good tension in the acting and beautiful series. The bad guys were BAD and you end up rooting for the good to overcome. My one complaint? I wish it had gone another few episodes to tie up ends. I would highly recommend this series to any adventure lover.",1388707200,,338,4.65
3781746,5,B001RXDM2M,"Crusoe is one of the best television series that you've never heard of. In its short, one-season run, it effectively creates an atmosphere of excitement and adventure. One part 'Lost' and another 'Gilligan's Island,' Crusoe remains true in theme with the novel. Robinson's ingenious inventions always capture one's attention, and the sets and surrounding scenery are always beautiful.

The chemistry between the lead actors conveys a humorous-yet-serious attitude. The relationship between Crusoe and Friday is incredibly believable, and brings a depth to what is occasionally an over-the-top series. The supporting cast just as excellent, sporting industry names such as Sean Bean and Sam Neill.

The series is very clean and family-friendly, supporting strong family values, faith, personal commitment, and morality.",1386547200,3,818,5.808333333333334

The scenery (both human and botanical) was breath taking. The stories were interesting. It has action, romance, adventure, culture, history, beautiful locations, and lots of scenes with Philip Winchester with his shirt off. (woo hoo!) And it's clean! That's a rare thing these days. You can enjoy it with the family. The hero is moral, honest, dignified, and is clearly a good guy. There is no cursing or sex. Definitely worth seeing again and again.

If you are not familiar with Crusoe, it takes place on a deserted island--one of my favorite story settings--and this series, much like Gilligan's Island, dwells on missed attempt after missed attempt to escape the island. Unlike Gilligan, the characters are rather clever.",1355961600,,370,4.75

3781769,5,B001RXDM2M,"I would recommend this for anyone to try. Gorgeous cinema, swashbuckling action and compelling human drama, all rolled into one. I had concerns based on a previous review that the excitement would be broken up by long, boring stretches of ""the wife back at home"" but in fact those scenes are woven very organically into the storyline and compelling in their own right. (Like such intelligent films as ""Usual Suspects"" and ""Memento"" it behooves you to pay attention to the trail of little clues that's laid in those scenes.)

The acting overall is excellent, with such well known names as Sam Neill and Sean Bean and I can't say enough about the lead actors. In a show based on two men trapped on an island together the chemistry is all important and these two have a palpable brotherly bond. In addition their physicality adds a tremendous dimension of realism - it appears to me they perform much of their own fight and stunt scenes. Are some of the gadgets and gizmos improbable? Perhaps, but you're too caught up in the adventure to care.

In this day and age of reality tv and maybe two basic genres of shows produced in a neverending supply, this was a a great find and it's depressing that such a unique drama was killed after only one season. As other reviewers have pointed out, however, that shouldn't deter you from watching as the story arc was brought to an emotionally satisfying conclusion and the one season is complete in its own right.

The dvd package art is beautiful and it even comes with the Robinson Crusoe book!  (Follow-up Note: I ordered this item as a Christmas gift and this time it wasn't packaged together with the book. A little disappointing as it makes a nifty gift presentation that way. I'm not sure why it came with a book last time and not this time or if there's a way to pre-determine that when you order.)",1353542400,2,1845,4.581818181818182

I had bought the series because it was a great price,vaguely remembered that I had fully intended to check out the show while it was airing but never did, and because Philip Winchester is in one of my fave series, Strike Back.  We enjoyed dinner and 2 episodes a night, and even though we each have  different tastes in tv and movies, we all loved every minute of it.

Other reviewers have gone over the plot, and described the fantastic scenes and the marvels of their tree house all of which are so true...but it is also a wonderful story of believing in the one you love no matter what happens. It is fast-paced, pulse-racing action and so very beautiful and tender at the same time. We certainly need a sequel, a movie, or a trilogy to tie up the cliff-hanger ending!!!!

This version of the story follows a young Robinson Crusoe played by hunky Philip C. Winchester who is the only survivor of a shipwreck.  Crusoe finds himself alone and stranded on a lavish-exotic island with its share of mystery and danger.  Luckily for Crusoe he is able to make fast friends with the equally handsome and capable Friday played by Tongayi Arnold Chirisa after saving him from being sacrificed by cannibals.  Crusoe teaches Friday English and about the technology he's learned in England while Friday on the other hand teaches Crusoe how to survive on the island.  The two work together to build a safe place to live (a tree house that you have to see to believe, its visually impressive) while Crusoe attempts to find ways to get off the island so that he can return to his beloved wife whom he his admirably devoted to and his 2 children in England.  Returning home to his family isn't nearly as easy as it sounds especially with the island being visited by pirates, mutineers, and cannibals all providing different levels of adventure and danger outside of the two's day-to-day island adventures.",1333411200,,1218,4.803827751196172

Instead you get the straight forward story of Crusoe, who misses his family and stays faithful to his wife even though he has not seen her in six years.  The show takes liberties with the classic novel, however they are usually not harmful to the overall story.  Philip Winchester is excellent as Crusoe and Tongal Arnold Chirisa is fabulous as Friday.  They complement each other well.  Also appearing in the series to excellent effect are Sean Bean and Sam Neil.  The show had only twelve episodes, however they are certainly worth the cost of the DVDs if you enjoy action, intrigue and adventure.

This was a cheap DVD and the quality certainly matched the price
The picture quality was very good BUT audio was shocking...a complete waste of money
I could only hear half of the audio and that was way out of sync with the lips...bloody shocking
Is there anything I can do apart from just dropping it in the rubbish bin
On a brighter note, Virginian was the same as Season 1 bought from you earlier...excellent
This was disappointing but will not stop me from any further purchases

Philip Winchester (as Crusoe)embodies the spirit of a true hero and brings authenticity, intelligence and good looks to the character. This show makes you wish you could be on the island with Crusoe having all his adventures - it's a great fantasy escape show. I like the way the show goes from showing their present circumstances to flashbacks of their former lives so you slowly learn about their past. And, the scenery in South Africa is breathtaking. It's too bad it didn't last longer than the 13 episodes, but the short series is very enjoyable as it is.",1320624000,,659,4.7894736842105265

3781795,4,B001RXDM2M,"Crusoe is a short-lived television show which ran for only 13 episodes. It was filmed primarily in South Africa, with some bits done in the UK, and overall it was a very fun production, with a lot of swashbuckling, pirates, cannibals, and other exciting island adventure. The writers were very creative, inventing new scenarios each week to keep the stories entertaining. While the storyline did not follow the original book, it was a very well done series, and I'm sorry it didn't run longer. The DVD set has no extras, but the episodes themselves more than make up for it. There is nothing really offensive about this show (no nudity or swearing) so it's suitable for the whole family.

I've seen big budget movies that weren't as good as this series. I can think of a few modern films about pirates and the carribean that look like pathetic garbage compared to this intelligent work of cinema. Why this show didn't take off is anyone's guess.  I suppose it just didn't find enough fans in its time slot, or some other logistical excuse.  That's the way a lot of good tv series seem to die.

I put this series up there with ""Firefly"" in the pantheon of slaughtered television shows that should have run a lot longer, but for whatever reason weren't given a fair chance. Unlike that brilliant sci-fi show, however, I don't think they'll be making a movie to conclude Crusoe. At least they left it in a decent place, and not with some cliffhanger.

I would certainly recommend this show for everyday viewing.",1296777600,4,1508,4.675471698113207

Follow Crusoe as he searches his memories to discover what the events that brought him to that deserted island really mean.

Our son is 11 and each time after watching an episode, he would charge around the house with his ""pirate"" sword stuffed into the waistband of his jeans/shorts as they do in the movie!!!  What WONDERFUL characters to emulate.... full of integrity and honour.
We are South African and have lived happily in Canada for 3 years now.  This series was filmed in South Africa and the scenery - oh the beauty of Africa.....  Buy this and watch it when it is minus 40 degrees outside!!!  It will take you around the world... all from the comfort of your living room.
Do yourself a favour and watch this - it is money well spent.

However, the word 'sex' is never mentioned (we're on episode 8 or so)- how refreshing????  We need more of this, we honestly do. Not that I am a prude, but it is wonderful just to be able to watch something together without ME worrying what the next scene is going to bring....... and then have difficult questions to answer!!!! ""Mommy, what does XYZ mean when he says...""
This man REALLY loves his wife and his children.  We need to see more of this too instead of people just falling into bed together.  This is true commitment - true commitment.
GREAT characters - incredibly well acted - BEAUTIFUL scenery - exciting action sequences - McGyver type gizmos - and of course, the eye-candy!!!

Also, once you get over the ridiculous aspects -- he's still wearing clothes from his ship 6 years later and they look new -- the stories themselves were not so bad.

Sean Bean (one of my favorite actors) and lo and behold, Sean Bean does a wonderful job as Crusoe's father, which made the resemblance wonderful.  Another thing I enjoyed was the obvious enjoyment that Crusoe and Friday got out of their roles, they were having fun and it showed. They also seemed to have a good raport between them, as real friends would.  The villans were suitable, the sub plots convoluted enough to keep you guessing, and overall, the acting was good.  Gripes?  Not too many.  Sometimes Crusoe's island seemed to resemble Gilligan's, with all the comings and goings, but you wouldn't have had as much of a story otherwise.  And the fact that when I ordered the series, I also got a unwanted copy of DeFoe's book. That's all the gripes I had, short of waiting for Johnny Depp and cronies in their Pirate garb to show up (well, it seems to have been filmed in the same area).

3781807,5,B001RXDM2M,"An absolutely super, although shortlived, TV series filmed mostly on location in beautiful South Africa.  Philip Winchester(""Flyboys"") and Tongai Arnold Chirisa are two of the most handsomest, physically cut as well as good actors to play Crusoe and Friday that you'll ever see.  Sam Neill plays well the mysterious yet suspiciously oily, benefactor and powerful overlord of Crusoe's past and probably his future.

There's humor and drama, tons of swashbuckling adventure and even romance all shot in gorgeous surroundings of jungle, endless beach(where's my ticket, I'm going!), with all types of peril to savor.  And they take haven in the coolest of treehouses.

The story jumps mostly between lost island and 17th century England as the ever inventive Crusoe and his family long for each other while both are under the threat of sinister forces.  The episodes for the most part run together, and when they don't, it's less interesting.  Outside of Friday, the women in Crusoe's noble though a bit naive life are the most interesting characters.

Finally, for those worried about the culmination of the story since the series was not extended, and even though I would, of course, love to see more ""Crusoe"", I feel that the ending provided does tie up fairly well the story in a wistfully and fateful way.  We know where each of the main characters are ultimately headed.  And soon.

3781810,5,B001RXDM2M,"Crusoe:
An action packed television series loaded with pirates, cannibals, flying musket shot, and a dog called Dundee.  Crusoe: the Complete Season is a swash-buckling tale based on the famous novel of which almost everybody has heard but almost no one has read.  However, if you are searching for an exact portrayal of the story, you will be disappointed.  Or if you are merely wishing to be entertained, love adventure, don't mind a smattering of romance, enjoy seeing committed love between a husband and wife, and take delight in two friends who are as close as brothers, then Crusoe is definitely a movie series you will enjoy time and time again.
For the most part, Crusoe is very family-friendly.  There are a few scenes with bloodshed, and once in a while a lady tries to romance Crusoe (a very forward pirate lady in the first episode and another in the later episodes), whom he gently tells that his heart is given to another and he will remain faithful to that one.  I was amazed to see his steadfastness in this area; few movies/television series have this theme continuing throughout the duration.  Another caution for parents is that there is a nude scene with one of the women; nothing sexual takes place, but Crusoe has fallen down a cliff side and needs to get back up, so she's trying to make a rope with everything she's got on . . . a rather awkward situation.  It happens to be in my least favorite episode (in which Friday falls ill from eating poisoned honey).  In fact, I personally believe it is one of the more stupid programs, but every television series out there has at least one boring installment.  So those are my warning to parents.  Adults, of course, view at their own discretion.
The main underlying plot of the story is for Crusoe to figure out a way to get back to his family in England, taking his friend, Friday, along with him.  By the way, he is called Friday because Crusoe cannot pronounce his real name, a fact Friday seems to love resurrecting.  While he is desperately searching for some means of returning home (quite a few opportunities arise, and at least once he must choose between leaving Friday behind and/or being left behind with his friend), an evil in England is trying to destroy the small family he loves so much.  Of course, if I told you who the bad guy was and just why he's the bad guy, that would ruin the story completely.
My last thought on this particular television series, is that though they call it the Complete Season, it is far from finished.  The last installment leaves the viewer hanging, not knowing what happens next.  So, my hope is that enough people will enjoy the few episodes there are and a general outcry for one more (only one, maybe two are needed to consummate the series) will prod the producers of Crusoe into finishing and airing the last show.  That way Friday will stun the modern world of that time with his Einstein-like intellect, and Crusoe can finally be with his family and the wife he loves.",1246406400,36,2993,4.597744360902255

Of course it's not the book and it's not meant to be. Nowhere in the credits it says ""based on the novel by Daniel Defoe"" as it usually does with films or series based on novels so the writers took the liberty to write a more adventurous tale. And to me they did it spot on.
It's got drama, adventure, romance, betrayal, pirates, mutineers, cannibals, Carib Indians and a wonderful scenery filmed both in England and South Africa.
It's outstanding entertainment for the whole family. The first time I watched it with my then six and four year old kids and they loved it. There might be a bit of violence but nothing like films nowadays and no foul language.
