8631915,3,B00HEM1P4C,"Here's another interpretation of ELP classics songs without the driving force of a keyboard player. Paul Bielatowicz, who is with Carl Palmer since 2004 and had played with Neal Morse is on the guitar, Simon Fitzpatrick is the bassist. The two had the task to play some keyboards parts on their own instruments. The result is a heavier version of ELP songs, different because of the new sound of each instruments, but also because each musician didn't try to replicate all the keyboards notes. The sound is not polish like a studio release, but still enjoyable for a live recording. The picture is ok not great and the light show is basic with some animations on a screen in the back. The highlights are the version of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" and ""Fanfare for The Common Man"", the latter including a intense Carl Palmer drum solo. However, i was a bit disappointed to see only a short version of ""Tarkus"". This is nice music and performance, but maybe i was expecting something more spectacular visually like a ELP show, which is not the case here. The DVD looks more like a intimate show in a little club.",1395100800,8,1110,4.6395939086294415
