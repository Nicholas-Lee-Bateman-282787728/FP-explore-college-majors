A Moment to Remember is a 2004 Korean classic on the level of French masterpiece A Man and A Woman. It is more than a great love story. It is a piece of art.

The film centers on a young woman of privilege Kim Su-jin (Son Ye Jin) whose turbulent 20s have culminated in a failed affair and subsequent botched elopement with her older boss. As the facts are clearly in front of everyone at home and at work, a humiliated Kim Su-jin moves back in with her family and returns to the office. Aware and ashamed at what she has done to herself and her family, she maintains an understated dignity and quietly tries to move forward with the help of her mothers acceptance and more importantly, a Dad who fights his cultural instincts by fully accepting and supporting a daughter who seems to have had a somewhat stormy and zany youth.

After a brief encounter with a man Choi Chul Soo (Jeong Woo Sung) at a convenience store (a man who tried to take the Coca-Cola she forgot at the counter), she stumbles upon Chul Soo soon after when she accompanies her dad to a job site. Chul Soo turns out to be her Dads head foreman and carpenter.

After a short series of chance meetings, Chul Soo and Su-jin begin dating. The sweetness, playfulness and pure joy of finding each other is vividly portrayed in Spanish music and footage. As class status is very important in Korea, Su-jins parents (especially her dad) do not approve of Chul Soo, an orphan with no family and little formal education. But when her Dad sees how deeply his daughter loves Chul Soo, he puts up little fight and approves of the marriage.

Chul Soo turns out to be very responsible, outrageously smart, a great husband and a rising star in his father-in-laws construction business. He passes the architect license exam on the first try. That is when life begins to change. Su-jin becomes increasingly forgetful. Finally seeking medical help, she learns that at age 27, she has Alzheimers Disease. Her condition deteriorates steadily and rapidly.

There are several aspects of this movie that make it a masterpiece of a love story, a classic. First, there is the depth, quality and unshakable commitment that Su-jin and Chul Soo have for one another. They confront emotionally wrenching memories and betrayals from Chul Soos childhood, not because they have to but because Su-jin knows it is the right thing to do. She seeks intimacy with her husband and she wants her husband to resolve conflicts that torment him. Second, the relationship, as portrayed on the screen, is rare in cinema. There is a sweet, sensitive and realistic look into the games, teasing, inside jokes, hopes and fears that define their marriage. Theirs is a happy home. They both are lucky to have found each other and they know it.

But it is the cinematic treatment of the onset and progression of Alzheimers that sets this film apart. Here is a remarkable couple (with every resource at their disposal) finding themselves powerless to control or reverse the devastation wrought by a disease that robs a person of their memory  and therefore, their soul. But in spite of the destruction and ultimate consequence of a disease, the film portrays a couple and family that rises to the occasion. Hardship does not destroy Su-jin and Chul Soo and the principle characters in the movie. Rather, it brings out the best in each friend and family member as they come together to realize Chul Soos wishes.

You will find the ending very inspiring. And more than likely, you will watch it again and again. Korean film from director, John H. Lee, has done a masterful job. A Moment to Remember is brilliant. I have never seen anything quite like it.",1458432000,2,3690,4.690880989180835
8543458,5,B009P1XEIK,"No words ever written in any language could describe the tenderness and beauty found in this most wonderful Korean film from director John H. Lee. Both romantic and sensitive, it captures that joy we feel upon finally finding that someone where our heart can rest, and the gut-wrenching pain of watching them slip away before our pleading eyes.

It begins as Kim Su-jin (Son Ye Jin) is trying to put her life back together after an embarrassing office affair with her married boss ends in heartbreak at a train station. She returns home to live with her family, her loving father understanding rather judgmental. His foreman, Choi Chul Soo (Jeong Woo Sung), a carpenter, meets her by chance at a mini-mart where she has forgotten the can of Coke she just purchased. When they meet again she is embarrassed, but when he comes to her rescue during a street robbery a sweet romance begins.

There is humor and a wonderful sweetness to the couple's courtship missing in many films. That sense of longing and happiness just out of reach so prominent in Korean dramas will only gradually come into play as little by little Su-jin begins forgetting more and more and realizes something is wrong. Spanish love songs create a romantic and playful atmosphere during the first half of the romance which finally gives way to the film's lovely refrain during the heartbreaking latter half.

Lee paints a very real love which makes this not only rise above tear-jerker status, but put it into the romantic masterpiece category. Son Ye Jin is both beautiful and wondrous in her performance, and in the latter portion, Jeong Woo Sung lends depth to a young man faced with a loss so great it might destroy his life. Their day-to-day hardships and romantic plans are intruded upon by a devastating illness one is not supposed to get at the age of twenty-seven.

Their love and happiness as she quits her job and he leaves notes and pictures all over their house to remind her of things is quite emotional, but in a quiet way which the director never allows to become maudlin. When she realizes in a moment of clarity that she is breaking his heart she makes a decision which changes both their lives. But this film is not over, and its beautiful conclusion will choke you up and lift you up at the same time.

This film is unforgettable, and will become a part of anyone who sees it. For any person with the capacity for love deeper than the surface, A Moment to Remember will touch your heart and spirit and never fade from memory. A must own film.",1372809600,6,2531,4.640625
