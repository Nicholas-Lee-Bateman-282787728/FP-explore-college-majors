One girl does a solo performance and a couple of girls do a G/G. In the solo the girl leads the photog. down the hall and invites him into her room. She's wearing a nice mini. She doesn't waste time. She jumps on the bed and immediatly pulls off her panties and goes to play. She works herself over pretty good and its interesting if you overlook the pierced clit. I'm not fond of the piercings myself. If it is ugly no piercing is going to make it look better and if it looks good you can't improve on it. I know they say they get heightened clitoral sensations from the piercings but they will get less of a responce from me. I really don't suppose they give a damn  about that though. But it's her thing and she can do what she wants with it. I also feel the same way about bogus boobs. The G/G sequence was pretty good also. One girl love talking to the other while they are going at it. This show is also only 50 minutes long. Theyv'e got a good camera man for this series. He keeps his mouth shut when he should,aims the camera right and keeps his hands out of the picture.",1211328000,,1231,4.194092827004219

Thats not saying it is not good though. It has the usual flashing,Bar dancing etc. There are 2 G/G sequences and one solo. First G/G was new to me. The girls said it was new to them also,But they performed admirably. The second G/G I had seen before and it was still ok.
Good looking stuff. The solo girl I had also seen before and it was still interesting. She's taking business management and in the pre interview she was asked how often she's had sex at college. She said if her steady boyfriend was there it could be 20 times a week,maybe 40 times a week or even 50 times a week. Well now. The way I figure that would be 7 times a day Monday thru Saturday and 8 times on Sunday. Boy she's got one hell of a stud there. He keeps that up and he won't even live to make her graduation ceremony. It must cut badly into her study time also. I think she must be exaggerating a mite. She goes from that bit of information into her solo with a vibrator that won't vibrate but she still gets herself off without the vibrations. Good performance. From there it's to the end. Production is only 50 minutes long.",1211328000,,1258,4.159836065573771
