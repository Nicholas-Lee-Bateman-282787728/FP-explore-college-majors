8600123,3,B00E1NR91A,"This is an altogether different conception than than the earlier productions in ""Tutto Verdi"". The setting is a mix of modern and classic elements. It comes from Trieste. ""La battaglia"" is said to be the last of Verdi's early operas. The story alludes, as so often in the previous operas, on the freedom and unification of Italy. The staging does little to lighten up the stiff and somewhat pompous opera. Of the four main singers, I liked Andrew Richards (Arrigo) best. Dimitra  Theodossiou (Lida) is soprano with a big vibrato. She convinced more later on, I thought, Leonardo Lpez Linares (Rolando) is a bit wobbly, and did not improve as much. As a whole, the interpretation is difficult to grasp and to understand.",1414022400,,719,4.845528455284553
