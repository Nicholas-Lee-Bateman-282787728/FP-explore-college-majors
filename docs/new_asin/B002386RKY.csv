8349709,5,B002386RKY,"This DVD is a compilation of videos and pictures from Dr. Yang's childhood to modern day YMAA events. This DVD includes videos of graduations, seminars, celebrations, and many other major events in YMAA history. In my opinion, the most interesting aspect of this DVD is that it shows how many members of the YMAA have grown over time, from new students to teachers in their own right. Even if you are not a part of the YMAA I would highly advise purchasing this DVD.",1304726400,,466,4.559523809523809
8349710,5,B002386RKY,"At first, I put this set aside to watch later because it is so long and has so much information. How silly! It has so much information. A must for any serious student of Chinese Martial arts. I have studied taiji for many years. My first teacher always spoke with love about his teacher Master Jou, Tsung-Hwa. Imagine the connection I felt after seeing this rare footage. This dvd set is a gem. Like fine jewelry, if it's not in the budget to buy it for yourself, put it on your wish list and receive it as a special gift.",1276473600,,522,4.23
8349711,5,B002386RKY,"This DVD set is a great celebration of the works of Dr. Yang- Jwing-Ming one of Qigong most sought after masters. From his humble beginnings to his creation of the YMAA to his ultimate creation of a monk like training setting he has created the mountains of California Dr. Yang has been a pioneer in spreading the benefits of qigong to the world.  A majority of this DVD set is demonstrations of his students at various retreats over the years performing various tajiquan exercise, with different weapons, and with partners on occasion.  Very cool to see a lot of forms packed into one DVD set.  There are also some interviews with Dr. Yang and even with his old masters!  A must have for your collection if you are a fan of YMAA, Dr. Yang, or just enjoy and appreciate watching different forms performed masterfully!",1266019200,,817,4.652777777777778
8349712,5,B002386RKY,"I have been a fan of Dr. Yang since about 1985.  I have read many of his books and have several of his DVD's.  I however do not live in an area where he has a school, so receiving these DVDs was a real pleasure.  The DVD starts with a backround look at Dr. Yang's personnel history and has many pictures from his life in Tawain.  There are several interviews and lecture moments that give you insight into this mans dream.  The video footage is mostly of demostrations that his school has done throughtout the years and was a real pleasure to see.  For anyone interested in seeing authentic traditional CMA take a look at these DVDs.",1254009600,,633,4.367521367521367
8349713,5,B002386RKY,"The ""YMAA 25-Year Anniversary"" DVD compilation is a fascinating look at Dr. Yang's life and the progression of YMAA as it materialized from a distant dream into an international martial arts community and network.  This tribute DVD set is presented on two disks and contains video footage, photographs, and interviews.

The material includes a short bio of Dr. Yang and an interview where he shares the motivation of wanting to preserve what his masters taught him, and why he has written so much and why he has taught in so many DVDs.  Then the program includes performances of solo and group kung fu and taiji sequences, demonstrations, and interviews.  Video footage includes Taijiquan, Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, Liuhebafa, Shaolin Long Fist, White Crane, and many weapons.

The quality of the DVD is excellent as with all of the products I've received from YMAA.  The DVDs have an easy menu system and also included is an eight page booklet that includes all of the chapters presented on the DVDs.  This guide is very nice to have to assist in finding a particular segment you wish to view.  Some of the older footage is just that, older.  So the quality is not the same as those that are filmed in YMAA studios.  Sometimes lines are present, lack of focus, lack of color, etc.  But that is what you get from older video footage.  The great thing is to actually have that old footage and get to see Dr. Yang and students of his perform various demonstrations.  They did an excellent job of transferring that old footage to the DVD to preserve it.  So when I say the quality is excellent it refers to the way YMAA put all of the footage together and created menus to find things.  The various segments differ in that sometimes the camera is moving, focus, etc.  It's not a studio video but a collection of many clips from demos spanning the last 25 years.

Disk one includes the bio of Dr. Yang, school demos and Taste of China demos from 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, demonstrations from the 1994 China tour, some footage from the expansion of the Boston school in 1991, documentary of YMAA from 2000,  forms from 2000 YMAA summer camp - Hungary.  There are a lot of demonstrations on this DVD.  Personally, I found the ones by Dr. Yang and some of the older masters the most interesting, but I also enjoyed seeing some of Dr. Yang's younger students perform.  There is a wide section of material covered in the demonstrations including many forms, various weapons, and even some self-defense applications being shown.

Disk two picks up where the first disk stopped with demos from the 2002 YMAA summer camp - Hungary.  There are then demos from the 2002 YMAA 20th year anniversary, 2002 YMAA summer camp - South Africa, 2003 YMAA summer camp - South Africa, 2004 summer camp - South Africa, 2005 YMAA summer camp - Portugal, 2006 YMAA summer camp - South Africa, a 2007 interview with Dr. Yang and finally a short piece from the 2008 Nicholas C. Yang ceremony.  Disk 2 also contains the standard YMAA extras, including video clips of other titles and the YMAA catalog.

If you like martial art demonstrations or if you would like to see the history and progression of Dr. Yang and YMAA, you should check out this DVD.  I really enjoyed watching it, seeing the older footage, and gaining some extra wisdom from Dr. Yang.  I especially found his words during the final segment of the 2008 Nicholas C. Yang ceremony regarding when you age and what you do very poignant.  Very interesting and entertaining tribute to YMAA's first 25 years!

8349714,5,B002386RKY,"I received this DVD set for review and immediately began ""judging the book by its cover"" so to speak.  ""Why would THESE be of interest to ME?"" I wondered.  Long story short, I got MUCH more out of these DVD's than I bargained for.

The demonstrations performed over a 25 year span were interesting to watch, to be sure, but for me the real messages of the DVD's became apparent as I listened to Dr. Yang tell his story, speak to interviewers, and lecture his students.

This man, Yang, Jwing-Ming, sets a wonderful example for us all.  His ability to take a dream--the YMAA--and manifest it into reality over a 25 year period is a wonderful example of the following traits:  creating a vision for the future; setting goals to achieve that vision; and taking action on his goals.  He also had the persistance, determination, mental focus, patience, toughness, an unwavering comittment to excellence, and a very real love for his students and his martial arts.

Actually, when I look at all the foregoing traits in retrospect--how could Dr. Yang NOT succeed in fulfilling his dream?!  THESE are the things I took away from watching these DVD's, and after you watch them, I hope you will too.",1249689600,,1189,4.705314009661835
8349715,5,B002386RKY,"I have always been a fan of Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's writing, and this DVD provided me with much needed background information and history.

The DVD was an interesting look into Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's early years. Many old photos have been collected ranging from early childhood, to modern times. Dr. Yang talks about growing up in Taiwan, his education and training, the fact that he did a demonstration in front of Cheng Kaishek, his arrival in the U.S., and opening of Yang's Martial Arts in Boston. The 2 DVD set is a compilation of class demonstrations, early seminars, cultural festivals, travels abroad, televised footage, and interviews.

You get to witness performances by Dr. Yang Jwing Ming, see a young Ramel Rones make his way through a push-hand competition, see old greats like Waysun Liao, Liang, Shou Yi, and Li, Mao Ching performing Taijiquan and Li Hue Ba Fa, and observe various martial arts demos. Some of the other interesting segments feature a Lion Dance, the 12 Kicks of Tam, a few interesting Taiji push-hand competitions, and chin-na sequences in front of a live audience.

Dr. Yang also gives interviews describing his early life, aspirations, and future goals for YMMA. This DVD is a nostalgic look into YMMA's past, and a reminder of the organization's goals to preserve Chinese culture and martial arts in modern times.",1246665600,3,1346,4.946902654867257
8349716,5,B002386RKY,"Review of YMAA's 25 Year Anniversary (2 DVD Set):

Dr. Jwing-Ming Yang established Yang's Martial Arts Association in 1982, and it has grown to 55 schools in 18 countries. Dr. Yang has also written more than 30 books and 80 instructional videos, has taught thousands of seminars worldwide, and was voted by Inside Kung Fu magazine as ""One of the ten people who have made the greatest impact on martial arts in the last 100 years.""

To celebrate these great accomplishments, YMAA Publication Center presents this tribute DVD, compiled from video footage and photographs of Dr. Yang, guests, and YMAA students from around the world. The program contains dozens of performances of solo and group Kung Fu and Taiji sequences, award-winning demonstrations, and interviews with Dr. Yang and senior YMAA students.

This comprehensive collection of rare archival footage includes (among other things) Taijiquan, Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, Liuhebafa, Shaolin Long Fist, White Crane, and many weapons demonstrations. Special footage is included featuring Grandmaster Li, Mao-Ching, Grandmaster Liang Shou-Yu, Master Jou, Tsung-Hwa and Sifu Jeff Bolt.

The set is comprised of two DVD discs with six hours of content.  There is a detailed biography of and interviews with Dr. Yang as well as the ability to choose from hundreds of scene selections.  There is also about one hour's worth of previews for other YMAA products.

This is an interesting tribute to YMAA's founder. Although created for promotional purposes, if you are interested in martial arts this set may be to your liking.  Well done!",1244937600,,1585,5.286852589641434
8349717,5,B002386RKY,"The 2-DVD set has a wealth of vintage video of students and masters demonstrating an astounding variety of martial arts forms.  There are literally too many styles presented to mention.  The DVD covers the period between 1983 and 2002.

The DVD also includes a review of the history of Yang, Jwing Ming, showing many vintage photos and videos of Master Yang.  It is a very interesting section of the DVD.  This is one of my favorite chapters on the DVD.  Another favorite chapter is the interview with Master Yang during which he provides a heart felt explanation of why and how he came to dedicate his life to the dissemination of correct martial arts knowledge.  I found it to be a very touching and illuminating interview.

Ramel Rones, one of Master Yang's top students, is seen in many of the clips demonstrating various styles and forms.  Ramel Rones along with David Silver has produced a handful of excellent DVDs through YMAA Publications including Sunrise Tai Chi, Sunset Tai Chi and Tai Chi Energy Patterns, an exhaustive study of the four major postures of Yang Style Taijiquan, those being Ward Off, Roll Back, Press and Push.

One of the nice sections is a documentary on the Boston YMAA School, in which the students are interviewed and filmed as they go about the daily business of learning forms, stretching, running drills and working with students.

The Master's demonstration section of the DVD is superb.  Liang, Shou Yu, Master Yang, Li, Mao Ching and other Masters provide an excellent show of various styles.  There is an excellent demonstration of Qin Na techniques by Master Yang.  As the demonstrations by the Masters were held over 25 years ago, the Masters are shown during a very spirited and young part of their lives.  Their humility while demonstrating at such a high level is admirable.  They are truly enjoyable performances.

During a daughter father theme during one of the infamous Taste of China shows, Master Yang and his daughter Kathy Yang demonstrate a two person internal sword set.  As imagined, Master Yang and his daughter perform flawlessly together, proving the wisdom of the adage that the acorn does not fall far from the tree.

At times some of the demonstrators make minor mistakes or experience a slight loss of balance.  Remember that these are live performances of very difficult and demanding forms.  On occasion people walk in front of the camera and some of the video has degraded over the years, but the footage is invaluable and well worth suffering through a little ""snow"" or distractions on the screen once in a while.

I highly recommend this DVD Anniversary set for all Master Yang's fans as well as those new to the martial arts.  It is an excellent look back at the life of Master Yang, his students and other teachers and masters.",1241222400,,2798,4.819706498951782
