8071575,4,B000A0GXKQ,"Although not quite as slick and flashy as his peer Albert Lee,Ray Flake's DVD is well worth your time and money if you want insight into Nashville style tele picking. Many of his own inventive compositions are featured and his taste and creativity are a great example to learn from.
In a similar vein to Brent Mason Ray isn't quite a 'natural' teacher,but if you like the style don't let that put you off;there's plenty here to keep you going for a while. A worthwhile purchase!",1435968000,3,478,4.569767441860465
8071576,3,B000A0GXKQ,"Flacke is an excellent hot rod Tele player and you can definitely learn some useful licks/techniques here thanks in no small part to the inclusion of the booklet containing Standard/TAB notation for most of the examples. Thank God Happy Traum was there to pull explanations out of Ray because he does not appear inclined to really break down what he is doing. The first song is in an alternate tuning which means at least 4 out of 5 people who buy the video will never really work that one out. For $10 less you can get ""Hot Nashville Guitar"" with Steve Travato which is much better. Steve is a monster player AND a real teacher (at USC)and he breaks down licks better than anyone else I have seen to date on video or DVD including Arlen Roth. Travato also has a book with a CD called ""Country Solos for Guitar"" which is also worth owning if you are an aspiring Danny Gatton, Albert Lee, Brent Mason, Johnny Hiland freak!!",1142380800,23,922,4.461538461538462
