7956318,5,B00005Y6X3,"While the three episodes per DVD of the earlier volumes was a little disappointing, in the end I didn't mind it too much. But imagine my joy when I got hold of this volume: 5 episodes! The reason is that the series was originally planned to be on 8 DVDs, but changed midway through to 6. Thus, we now get 5 episodes per disc. :D
This volume starts off with the conclusion to the two-parter from the last volume. It's pretty good - not spectacular, but satisfying. The next episode is Leki's Big Adventure, which is a throwaway episode about Leki. While I think Leki is adorable, I found this episode completely boring. It has very little story and no point in the end. Others may enjoy it, but I found it annoying.
The next three episodes get back on track and continue the overall story, but the most important thing about these episodes is that they show us that Orphen's former collegues at the Tower of Fang might not be so bad after all. Hartia especially had me in hysterics with his attempts to talk to Orphen. I won't spoil what he does, but it's hilarious. Childman on the other hand is dealt with nicely in the last episode on the DVD, in which Orphen has to accept the startling truth that his former teacher might not be such a bad guy after all. It's interesting to see Orphen struggling to figure out whether Childman really is his enemy or not, and I found myself struggling along with him.
Overall, an excellent volume. Once again, highly recommended.",1067904000,2,1467,4.477611940298507
7956319,4,B00005Y6X3,Well...in this volume you get Five episodes instead of only three which was the case in the first three volumes of Orphen...the story here is starting to unfold more...and you get to learn a little bit more about Childmen(Orphens teacher back at the Tower of Fang)..and..well..I won't spoil it for you...but the main reason why I gave this volume 4 stars only is because in the first two episodes the animation is very poor compared to what I saw in the first three volumes...but it then gets better with the last three episodes...bottom line is...if you are a fan of Orphen...I think you should get it...if your not..then I still would advise you to at least rent it.,1016582400,3,668,4.669491525423729
7956320,5,B00005Y6X3,"This installment of the Orphen series is well done. With exploration of more characters, and more in depth development of the backstory, Orphen-Mystere adds new flavor and depth to the characters and the story. I consider this one of the better Anime series out there.",1016236800,2,268,4.977777777777778
