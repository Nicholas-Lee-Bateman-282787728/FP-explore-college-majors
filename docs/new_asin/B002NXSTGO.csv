3960643,4,B002NXSTGO,"I'm gonna make this review short and sweet, just like those little Smurfy denizens that live deep in the forest far from human eyes - especially Gargamel's.

The third DVD is just like the previous two also available: 5 exclusive episodes that have the little guys on even BIGGER adventures plus an interactive Smurf village on things you may or may not know about the Smurfs.

So get this if you still want to build up your collection of Smurf-tastic DVDs of the Smurfs.  Incidentally, I wonder if they'll put the Snorks - an underwater version of Smurfs - on DVD ?  Only time will tell.",1271894400,,588,4.518867924528302
3960644,4,B002NXSTGO,I did like the cartoons but it seems that they come out with too few of the videos with too few of the cartoons.  Do you realize how many smurf cartoons there were and to bring out 5 every 6 to 8 months apart?  I'll be in retirement before they're even halfway through the list.  If they could put more on a disk or bring out the disks more often would be great.  That's my only request.  Thanks.,1260921600,5,396,4.0256410256410255
3960645,2,B002NXSTGO,"As I have said in a previous Smurf DVD review, at least they included episodes with Gargamel.  I am still disappointed with the limited episodes-5, and the fact that these releases are not in chronological order.  What happened to the episode where Baby Smurf arrived via stork?  I wish Warner Bros would stop playing and release another Volume of numerous episodes in the order that they originally aired.",1260403200,32,406,4.9411764705882355
3960646,1,B002NXSTGO,Smurfs cartoons remain a favorite for those people that grew up watching them as kids.  We got the full treatment with Season One Vol 1 and 2 but now it seems like miscellaneous episodes in no particular orders are being put out a few at a time.  Which WB associate made that irrational decision is an outrage.  So the 1 star vote is for the DVD.  We want season sets!,1257206400,64,368,4.214285714285714

3960652,5,B002NXSTGO,We were hoping that our grandson will enjoy this dvd like he did with the others.  Smurfs are always a good choice for children.,1381881600,,128,4.333333333333333
3960653,5,B002NXSTGO,Very good I am happy that I could share something that I watch as a child with my son. We loves it.,1373328000,,99,3.5454545454545454

3960657,3,B002NXSTGO,"The Smurfs are back, but only for five episodes! It seems Warner Bros. is either too lazy or greedy to release season sets!

The episodes on the single disc are:

Sleepwalking Smurfs
The Littlest Giant
Squeaky
The Sorcery of Maltrouchu
All's Smurfy That Ends Smurfy

Now I'm only giving this review three stars because I liked each episode, but come on Warner Bros., bring back the season sets!",1347926400,6,394,4.764705882352941
3960658,5,B002NXSTGO,"The Smurfs have never failed to please. My daughter is fascinated with them. She has every available season, volume there is.... well that is available. Luckily Amazon.com offers a few that you cannot get anywhere else. You will be pleased with this family favorite.",1326326400,,266,5.068181818181818
3960659,5,B002NXSTGO,"Our nephew adores the Smurfs, so we purchased this for Christmas.  He LOVED it!!!  I've not actually seen the video, but know through research that Amazon was the best place for finding several options at a great price.",1326240000,,219,4.7368421052631575
3960660,5,B002NXSTGO,We got this DVD as a gift for our niece. Anyone who like the Smurfs will enjoy watching this DVD.,1324252800,,97,3.9
3960661,1,B002NXSTGO,"When season 1 volumes 1 and 2 came out I was excited, purchased both, and had plans of purchasing the entire series.  I was impressed with the quality and value of these two sets.  When season 2 volume 1: True Blue Friends came out I could smell corporate greed immediately and have not purchased a Smurfs DVD since.  I can not understand why anyone would waste their money on these low quality 5 episode DVDs.",1317513600,5,410,4.44
3960662,1,B002NXSTGO,"I have to disagree with the whole ""buy a lame product mentality or they might punish us by not releasing any more of them."" Although this may be true, it will probably just encourage this kind of releasing of product to continue.

Maybe the studios should think about this, if you don't offer your customers something they want and be happy making a little bit of money, then they will get it by some other means...

Thank god for searching and utorrent downloads...right or wrong that's your personal choice...but look at the pc gaming industry. A majority of games are abandoned (not legally abandoned like ""abandonware""), but are either not available for sale as new or not supported to fix glitches...that's why people illegally download them, because that's the ONLY way to get them. Also, there's games I bought but crashed all the time...and fortunately for a few, some talented people made patches for free to fix the games, even though the producer profited from the sale of the game but assumed no liability to actually make it work.

I'm just saying, make the damn DVDs available for sale and people will buy them. Don't make them available and people WILL find a way to get them...

So to the Hanna Barberas and the Disneys, or whomever, do you want a little profit, or none at all?",1314662400,6,1294,4.687224669603524
3960663,2,B002NXSTGO,"I love the smurfs, but they need to put more than 5 episodes on a disc. Also, these episodes really sucked (as did pretty much all of season 2). ""Squeaky"" had me in tears. Love, love, love smurfs; barely tolerate this selection of episodes.",1299024000,4,240,4.4772727272727275
3960664,1,B002NXSTGO,"I agree with everyone else that believes these sets are overpriced.  $15 for 5 episodes is just crazy.  Don't any of the corporate folks read any of these reviews.  If they don't, they should, because the might actually learn something they can't read in an academic journal.",1294272000,24,275,4.808510638297872
3960665,4,B002NXSTGO,"Warner Home Video, when are you going to release the entire season 2 together in one product?  Buying a few episodes at a time is a bit frustrating!  And since there are only 15 episodes if you buy all 3 of season 2 DVDs, I am thinking there are some episodes from season 2 that are unobtainable.  Why not do nice seasonal collections like those available for other TV shows?",1285200000,9,375,4.328571428571428
3960666,1,B002NXSTGO,"I wish I could give this zero stars just because it's that bad.  Not the cartoon itself, that is 100 stars, but the DVD itself.  I went out and within the first few days bought the Vol 1 & 2 for Season 1 and have not bought any since.  Why would I want to waste my time buying something for x amount of dollars for a few episodes when I can pay the same amount before for half a season.  Who do we need to contact to spread the word to say ""Season Sets"".  The problem is with nobody buying these sets they will not release anymore DVD's.  Oh well it's another great show that will not make it to DVD. :(",1278720000,,603,3.901639344262295

8375665,4,B002NXSTGO,"I mean it's the Smurfs---how can you not love it?  I know I wish they came out with all the seasons on DVD and this company is stupid because everyone would buy all of the seasons for more money than these little ones cost.  Oh well I will take the Smurfs any way I can get them.  I grew up in the 80's and this was my Happy Place on Saturday morning. Now I show them to my 5 year old son and he loves them too.  It's nice to share the magic with him.  We live in Germany now and sometimes when we walk in the forest and see the red mushrooms he will say ""Look Mom do you think that is the Smurf village?!""  And it makes my day :)",1475971200,,630,3.734848484848485
