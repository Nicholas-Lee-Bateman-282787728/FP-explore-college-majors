8411532,5,B00006785C,"If you have ever wondered what is going on and what scholars think about Genesis, this is the video for you. Dr. Fretheim explores the story of Genesis and how it can be our story. His work is very clear for all educational backgrounds. You do not need to know Hebrew or scholarly jargon to follow and you will at the same time find a discussion about things you have always wondered about in the story. I would also recommend Dr. Fretheim's books if you are interested in this subject matter.",1021420800,2,493,4.428571428571429
