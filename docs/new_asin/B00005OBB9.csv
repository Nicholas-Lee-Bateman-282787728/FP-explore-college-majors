1640743,5,B00005OBB9,"If you're a fan of the hit movie ""THE MATRIX"" you have GOT to own this DVD.  It goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than ever thought imaginable to give us an insight of the inner working of the brothers Wachowski's brain.
These two fine fellows have a magical way of bringing their ideas to reality and I take my hat off to them.
The enthusiasm they generate rubs off on all the cast and crew and I wait with bated breath for the next two Matrix movies.  This is going to be the trilogy to top all trilogies.
I love getting all the background information ~ conceptual, musical, editorial, graphical and the makers of The Matrix have outdone themselves with providing everything the avid fan wants and they also dangle the carrot before our eyes with what's to come.
The cast went through ""merry"" hell to deliver the goods on this movie and KUDOS to you, especially Keanu Reeves who for most of the time was recovering from neck surgery.
I agree with all and sundry and this film should have got more Oscar nods, but let's hope that The Academy do not fail next time to give credit to whom it is long overdue for the amazing piece of filmaking that is The Matrix.
I would also add that I am very pleased that they included what the fans are saying because this film has generated fandom as never before.  I would have liked to have been involved more with the international get together's and friendship this movie has made for the fans out there.  Congratulations to ""KYOTE"", ""KIRA"", ""AKS"" and ""LUCID DREAM"" for getting their perspective out there.
VERY WELL DONE!!",1006041600,6,1568,4.491228070175438

It includes ""practice"" scenes from the two sequels, lots of interviews with the main characters, explanations of the stunt work and overall a great setup. It is definitely worth every penny and then some.",1005955200,,280,4.9787234042553195
1640745,4,B00005OBB9,"Kudos and assorted other cheesy nitrate laden snack-foods to Warners for pushing the envelope with this release.  This is a second DVD loaded with supplements released as a companion to the original Matrix DVD.  There are promo materials for the upcoming sequels, additional documentaries about the first film and an interview segment with uuber-fans of the original.
Warners recognized the animosity that releasing the ""definitive"" or ""super special edition"" DVD years after the primary release fosters among fans of particular films.  Think of this as a service patch for the original.  The price should be a bit lower, but nothing's set in stone until it actually hits the shelves.
Thanks for the effort Warner.  You're very close to getting it right.",998524800,50,754,5.198347107438017

I thought it was a little to much to take in one sitting, and the special features should be in the documentary. I thought it gave to much stuff away as to the future of The Matrix, but it really takes you into the life of the movie and is really, really in-depth and interesting to watch. I didn't like how one of the actors had a cigarette in his mouth, but no big deal. This isn't a sequel, this is a behind-the-scenes thing that should have been put on the official release. Go buy it, only if your a hardcore fan.",1266883200,,585,4.095652173913043
1640785,5,B00005OBB9,"There is no excuse for anyone to have not watched this movie. But how many people who watch it really understand that it is gives a superb analogy to understanding our current reality.

We live in a world of illusion, distraction, economic slavedom and material indulgence. Breaking free from these culturally programmed distractions will enable you to break free from the real Matrix that we inhabit.

Still think the Matrix is fantasy???  To really explore the reality of our 'matrix' try reading the book by Ouspensky called ""In Search of the Miraculous"", and the book by Laura Knight-Jadczyk called ""The Secret History of the World"".

It's your choice,  get swallowed up in the illusion of job titles, pensions, media propagated fear, control and consumption or start living your own truly free life!!!!",1196035200,,807,5.083333333333333

1640787,5,B00005OBB9,"I love ""Behind the Scenes"" footage, and this DVD met my expectations. It really goes down into HOW they made the movie; they cover the training, the journey to Australia for filiming The Matrix, visual effects, sound effects.
One really interesting feature was the bullet cameras, which is very, very new in Hollywood. Hundreds of cameras take still pictures (making it slow motion) while another swivels around. I hadn't realized the effort it took to film, say, Trinity's kick in the beginning of The Matrix, or Neo dodging bullets.
There are also several interviews with the actors themselves (Fishburne, Moss, Reeves, and Weaving-- in his own Australian accent, which I've never heard before.) and the directors, how they came up with this concept.
I really think this is worth watching.",1055030400,3,791,5.092307692307692
1640788,5,B00005OBB9,"One of the best and coolest documentaries I've ever seen.  Anyone who loves the matrix, or loves 'technical but not overly technical' documentaries will love this.

One thing I love about Revisited is how much it feels more like a separate film from the Matrix;  at the moment I'm watching Revisited more than the movie, and enjoy it every time.

Also, the movie is divided into chapters (just as every other DVD is...) except on this DVD, each chapter is a separate sub-documentary that focuses on a specific aspect of the film (example: special effects, costumes, etc.) Come to a chapter on the DVD that you don't think will interest you?  Hit the ol' skip button on your remote and you can go to the next sub-documentary.

Another thing I love about this is how much closer you feel to the cast and crew when you are finished watching;  you see how they think, train, work, film, imagine, create, design, build, and just about everything else that has to do with the matrix films (yes, it briefly discussed the trilogy near the end.)  You feel higher than other Matrix nerds after you watch this simply because you know a few more random facts about it than they...and I love that feeling.",1054598400,14,1192,4.61611374407583
1640789,3,B00005OBB9,"The revolutionary sci fi action spectacular of 1999 gets the re-release treatment with a new disc complete with tons of extras. Once Warner Brothers are onto a good thing, they milk it for all it's got, and the Matrix is no exception. With an endless amount of special features, behind the scenes info and hidden features, this disc is impressive, yet sometimes screams ""filler"", with some useless featurettes; ""The True Followers: fans describe their view of The Matrix"" among others. Sure, it's a curio for fans, but how about a Director's Commentary or something more substantial than endlessly detailed ""making of""s and so on. Most interesting, is the upcoming Matrix Anime project which looks very stylish and inventive. Apart from a few interesting bits of info however, this disc, while a must-have for the die-hard Matrix fans, is somewhat dissapointing. Some solid production details can't cover the disc's unsubstantial feel.",1023753600,3,935,5.24

1640791,5,B00005OBB9,"This tape is a little over two hours and gives an in-depth behind the scenes look at the making of THE MATRIX. Everything from conception to pre-production to production and post-production is covered. The tape includes interviews with the four major actors; Joe Silver, the producer; and most importantly the Wachowski brothers. Explanations of the development of bullet time and an examination of the exhaustive training for the fight scenes are explored. A sneak peak of the upcoming Matrix sequels and a look at the Animatrix shorts to be released are also included. Be forewarned however, some of this stuff doesn't show up until after the credits have rolled and ended. Die hard fans and anyone interested in the movie-making process will benefit most from this video, but it's also interesting enough that anyone who liked THE MATRIX will probably enjoy.",1013385600,2,861,5.113475177304965
1640792,5,B00005OBB9,"I was hesitant to buy this DVD; I felt that the studio should have placed the material on a Matrix Special Edition DVD instead.  But now I am so glad that I bought it!  This is a 2-hour documentary on the making of the first film, with a few tidbits about the next 2 films.  It's the best, most extensive behind-the-scenes film I've ever watched.  It covers the making of the film from pre-production to principal photography to post production.  There's a lot of coverage on how the actors trained for the martial arts scenes in the film, really grueling training.  If you're into this type of material, it's worth buying.  There are extensive interviews with the four main actors.  Best of all, you can see the original fight scenes as played out by the Asian stunt team and compare this to the filmed sequences with the actors.",1012089600,4,830,4.5608108108108105
1640793,5,B00005OBB9,"Most of the other reviewers have covered the main content on the disc well.  If you would find a 2 hour documentary that goes deeper into the making of the Matrix than the extras on the main DVD interesting, this is for you.  A must-have for hard-core Matrix fans, a decent rental for the casual fan.  You probably won't watch the documentary twice.
HOWEVER, this DVD has huge benefit which I haven't seen mentioned anywhere else online- the ""hidden"" features.  There are a bunch of them.  Most are short, video clips covering particular subjects (example, an anecdote about ""the Woman in Red"" describes how a bystander was so distracted by the actress that he seriously damaged his car).  But the real gem is the hidden ""jukebox"".  It's found off the ""languages"" menu, and has 41(!) full-length audio-only tracks, all leading-edge indie electronica stuff (no Prodigy or Rob Zombie here!).  Many (all?) of the songs are used as background music in the video portions of the disc.  Sound quality is pretty good -- some songs are more obviously compressed than others.  It's this feature that really ""made"" this disc for me... it's a shame they chose to hide it so well, since many people (and apparently most ""professional"" reviewers) don't know it's there.",1010880000,15,1256,4.882075471698113
1640794,5,B00005OBB9,"""The Matrix Revisited"" picks up where the special edition DVD leaves off.  If you watched every special feature on the Matrix DVD and were left wanting more, then this DVD is a must-see.
This DVD starts at the beginning of the Matrix story - when the Wachowskis were just two guys who had a great screenplay, and Warner Brothers ""knew they bought something cool... they just weren't sure what it was.""  Then we get a blow-by-blow account of production, beginning with the four weeks of Kung Fu training with Hong Kong master stunt choreographer Woo-Ping to the storyboarding, really special special effects, filming, costuming, set construction, wire stunt work, and more.
The documentary features interviews with the Wachowskis, producer Joel Silver, production designer Owen Patterson, costume designer Kym Barrett, fight choreographer Woo-Ping, and many other people who give insight into that often-asked question ""What is the Matrix?""  Other interviews feature the film's principle actors: Keanu Reeves (Neo/Thomas Anderson), Lawrence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), although I thought it was strange that none of the supporting actors even so much as showed up in the documentary (even in the behind-the-scenes footage).
The DVD also includes tantalizing bits about the next two movies: ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" although those productions are shrouded in mystery and the DVD doesn't give that much concrete information.
""The Matrix Revisited"" is required watching for any die-hard Matrix fan, and if you're that die-hard, you might want to own it so you can watch it multiple times... what else are you going to do until MAY 2003 when the next movie comes out? (Thank goodness we have Star Wars Episode II and Lord of the Rings II to look forward to before then...)",1010793600,,1848,5.27891156462585
1640795,3,B00005OBB9,"I bought this DVD assuming that it contained the Matrix movie, along with a bunch of extras.  WRONG!

Overall, it was a great companion to the movie. It features interviews with Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Yuen Wo Ping, Bill Pope, the Wachowskis, Joel Silver, Kym Barrett, Barrie Osborne, John Gaeta, etc.; artwork, storyboards, behind-the-scenes footage, etc. Though it misses the ease of navigation of the dvd, it stands alone quite well.",1008288000,,511,5.4

behind the scenes look at every aspect of the film from start
to finish and beyond. A look at the martial arts and website as
