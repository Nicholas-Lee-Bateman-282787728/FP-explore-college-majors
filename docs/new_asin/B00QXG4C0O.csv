8693212,4,B00QXG4C0O,"Great resource for woodworking plans/projects. Missed the last star for portability, that is I can't easily use it on my tablet which is what I'd have in my workshop. Search feature works well on the computer though.",1467763200,,216,4.864864864864865
8693213,2,B00QXG4C0O,"Not sure what to think at this time. I went back to  the very first issue. It downloaded perfectly. Now to the newest issue. Seems like it takes forever to download. I was able to see the first three pages then it went blank. I have a fairly new computer so, I doubt that, that is the problem. I will try again when I have more time and update my review at that time",1461715200,,366,3.945945945945946

8693215,4,B00QXG4C0O,"The first copy of this disc that I bought did not read in the DVD player, so I had to return it.  The second copy worked okay.  As for the disc itself, it's great to have the back issues at your fingertips instead of piled up in storage somewhere.",1430697600,,247,4.020408163265306
