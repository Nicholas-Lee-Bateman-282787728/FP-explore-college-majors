8090065,5,B000BO99I4,"Bought this for my elderly in-laws and they really liked seeing the ""real country"" singers as they put it.  I know they have watched it several times so I guess they do like it.",1419984000,,177,4.205882352941177

8090067,1,B000BO99I4,"Very disappointed, the disk was only 30 min. long and the same music that was on Vol. 2 so I suggest buying 2 as the music is good and a lot longer. This was the most expensive disk we have purchased for older country music.  Definitely not worth the price.  I would have sent it back but my husband opened it before realizing what it lacked.",1335484800,,342,4.166666666666667
