6926447,5,B00RD6DZL0,"The film is based on an incredible true story of Margaret Keane (Amy Adams) the creator of the Big Eyes painting phenomenon. For a decade her domineering husband Walter (Christoph Waltz) took credit for the paintings as he also had the gift of gab and can sell them. They market the paintings, posters, post cards etc. Eventually Margaret can no longer live with the lie, as this ends in a comical court room scene.

In addition to being a story of the painting, it is one of the male dominated society and over coming the obedience idea in the name of honesty. This is a subdued Amy Adams and not the sexpot we saw in ""American Hustle."" The acting was good, but I felt the film was just short of an Oscar nod.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1420934400,2,744,4.345323741007194
6926448,4,B00RD6DZL0,"We haven't seen Tim Burton make a movie as grounded as Big Eyes in a long time, and it's a refreshing turn for a director who has been coasting on CGI silliness for quite a while.  He still draws upon something personal here in recounting the loopy story of Walter (Christoph Waltz) and Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), renowned artists in the 1950s and '60s. Well, one of them was an artist. Thats kind of the point. Burton has long been a fan of the paintings of doe-eyed children the Keane's were famous for, and he's clearly invigorated by the chance to tell their story.

Reuniting with Ed Wood screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewsk, Burton paints a vividly complex picture of gender bias and repressed creativity, with a whole lot of betrayal thrown in for good measure. After leaving her first husband, no small act back in those days, Margaret met Walter Keane; a painter who resembles a street mime when we first see him. It's the perfect look for a guy who always seems to be performing, selling some aspect of his personality. He notices her talent for painting right away; the two become a pair, and soon the Keane empire is born as her paintings of sad, big-eyed children become a global sensation. There's just one big problem: Margaret didn't get any credit for her work for over a decade.

How does something like that happen? It was an era of creatively-stifled housewives and male dominance, that's how. Plenty of brilliant women were held back by a system that didn't value their input on anything except cooking and child-rearing, and Margaret bought into it while Walter exploited it. He convinced her nobody would buy her work unless his name was on it. He may have been right, too, but that doesn't make him any less of a creep. While he lives the high life, making famous friends and meeting powerful dignitaries, she's literally locked away churning out picture after picture while her daughter anguishes. Burton, along with another reliably strong performance by Adams, let us in on the quiet sadness of Margaret's plight.  She's ashamed and fearful of the lie she helped Walter construct; to admit the truth would be to admit a fraud. But she's also fiercely protective of her work and has a deep emotional connection to it. As Walter begins the mass production of the art, putting them in stores and on household goods everywhere, it's like something deep within Margaret's soul dies.

But what the Keanes are known for nowadays is the bizarre turn their marriage would ultimately take. They would go to court to decide who the true artist was and Walter turned it into a complete circus. Waltz taps into Walter's pathetic, increasingly desperate core. Where Margaret believes art can touch people's lives, Walter sees it as just another get-rich-quick scheme appealing to those looking for the latest fad.  It's easy to see why Burton would take to this story as it also works as a spot-on metaphor for the kinds of passionless films he's churned out in the past. Visually, this is probably the least obvious Burton movie he's ever done. While the color palette and somewhat kitschy tone give it away eventually, Big Eyes is a true and very welcome departure.",1420675200,3,3196,4.791288566243194
6926449,4,B00RD6DZL0,"A Tim Burton movie without Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter, who would have thunk it?  Some folks have compared this to Burton's earlier work Ed Wood, but this is a very different film indeed in a much more conventional world. Definitely not what one would normally expect from a Tim Burton film, but definitely worth watching.

Great performances from Christoph Waltz and Amy Adams. Amy is the actual painter here who developed her own style of portraying children, with the big eye look that became very popular in the early 60s. Waltz is her wanna be artist husband.  They would seem to have made an ideal partnership, as he's extremely adept at salesmanship, mass marketing and public relations, none of which his wife has any feel for, but he just can't accept not taking full credit for the actual work. Sort of the Music Man of the art world, if rather more manipulative and slimey.

His wife Amy has just left one overbearing marriage and accidently blunders in to one far worse, definitely jumping from the frying pan into the fire with Waltz. Meanwhile the art world is going beserk over the Big Eyes fad, unable to accept that anyone takes it remotely seriously as art. Terrance Stamp has a great role as one of the art critics leading the attack over these works. Things do of course fall apart over time, leading to a final denouement in court over ultimate credit for the work.  Waltz is great fun to watch as he insists on taking over his own defense, which is based on actual events.

So, it's a well made film, anchored by great performances by the leads and the supporting cast.",1420416000,86,1599,4.612676056338028
6926450,4,B00RD6DZL0,"From the director of Batman (1989) and Alice In Wonderland (2010) comes Tim Burtons story about an artist who strongly believes in her daughter and of her work. When Margaret flees from her abusive husband she is discovered by an artist who he claims that her work can be the next big thing. They marry and begin a life that could be artfully bliss until Mr. Keane starts a lie into motion that he is the artist behind the big eye paintings while Mrs. Keanes passion is ripped right from under her. The film stars Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz.

This was a great movie that had me hooked from beginning to end as your captivated by the direction and plot. It comes off as your typical enemy who tries to cash in on someone elses success. The performances by Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz were amazing and worked so well together you couldn't have asked for anything else. Especially that of Amy Adams whos character has a true talent that is only to be stolen by a complete stranger who he himself is a fraud in his own right. Every step of the way you could only feel terrible for Margaret while she watches Walters fame explode at the expense of her own work. There were moments when you wanted to yell at the screen saying What were you thinking in letting this man, despite being her new found husband, take credit for her own work?.

As for Christoph Waltz as Walter Keane, he played it so well as a charmer and self-proclaimed artist that nobody wouldve assumed he was a fake. He had every move calculated and quantified so that he would make it big in the vein of his wifes work. I just wanted to see him get caught so bad or for Margaret to come out from hiding and reveal who the real artist behind the big eyes really were. I couldn't believe how naive and self-centered Walter was towards Margaret that everything he was in the beginning from when they first met just disappeared and revealed who he really was by being a thief. Just as provocative Adams performance was I can say the same with Waltzs performance as well.

From a technical standpoint I really appreciated the direction and focus on the time periods as the film began in the 1950s.  Burton really brought out the times and made the film feel genuine; especially with the color palette. And the shift in tone of the film from starting as a romance film to then being a drama was done brilliantly as your not quite sure how the story would unfold. Theres a scene when Walter is getting over the fact that one of the art pieces was considered awful and of poor taste that he went on a rage fit that almost saw the movie turn into suspenseful moments at times. The pacing was done perfectly and just kept hitting the beats every step of the way.

One of my complaints about the film centers around one of the plot devices in which Mr. Keane is taking credit for his wifes work. By the end of the movie everything goes to court with Margaret trying to prove she is the real artist behind her husbands so-called success. How the judge decided to prove who the real artist is was what hurts the ending to a degree. Margaret shouldve came out with her plea from the beginning rather then let the lie sink in and dig a deeper hole for herself. All she wouldve had to do was paint a drawing that would show that Mr. Keane wasn't the artist as he proclaims he is. With that set complaint set aside I thought it was funny to see Walter be forced to make a painting in order to defend himself. You instantly knew he was screwed and only made you root for Margaret knowing there was light at the end of the tunnel and she would reclaim credit for her work.

I had a great time watching Big Eyes and was pleasantly entertained by Christoph Waltz and Amy Adams chemistry together. The story was great and you had an investment with these characters not knowing how everything would be resolved. Tim Burton is a talented director who can make a film look appealing and magical. If you ever get a chance I would hope everyone would watch Big Eyes cause you won't be disappointed.",1420156800,2,4039,4.38584779706275
6926451,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Artist Margaret Keene has lived quite the life! First she was an unhappily married mother of one. Next she left her husband and chose to struggle as a single mom, while trying to sell her unusual paintings of big-eyed waifs (it's an acquired taste, if you ask me, but you will recognize them instantly...). Then she met a fellow who began taking credit for her work and developed a HUGE market for it. After that... well. You kinda have to see it, because it unfolds so logically, it just SEEMS outrageous. AND you have to know what society's rules were in the 50s and 60s to understand why things were the way they were.

Director Tim Burton (""Dark Shadows"") working from a screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (jointly won a Golden Globe for ""The People vs. Larry Flint"") gives us a PG-13 movie that has already garnered many award nominations.

Part of the cast:
  * Amy Adams (""American Hustle"") Best Actress nomination from the Golden Globes for her portrayal of Margaret Keene, a 50s woman inching her way toward independence. We get to meet the ""real"" Margaret during the final credits.
  * Christoph Waltz (""Django Unchained"") This two-time Oscar winner has been nominated for Best Actor by Golden Globes for his spooky interpretation of the con man Walter Keene. This guy is so charming it's easy to see how he became Margaret's second husband, plus we can understand how he segued into the art of deception.
  * Danny Huston (""The Congress"") is Dick Nolan, the newspaper man who collaborates with Walter to create a phenomenal fad for those ubiquitous Big-Eyed Waifs.
  * Terence Stamp (""The Art of the Steal"") is John Canaday, the art critic who lambastes the fad with all the professional clout he can muster.
  * Krysten Ritter (Lots of TV) is DeeAnn, the friend who tells Margaret some unwelcome truths.

I don't remember any profanity, and certainly no violence or sweaty bodies;  there is no vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff, so I'm not sure why it's PG-13 except for the need to understand the 60s. Oh, and some smoking. This is a satisfying, true-life depiction of the evolution of an artist... Adams and Waltz do most of the heavy lifting and they are both excellent!

In the interest of fairness, please read the statement by Walter's daughter also on this Amazon site. I suspect the truth is somewhere in between....",1420070400,4,2358,4.773399014778325
6926452,4,B00RD6DZL0,"""Big Eyes"" (2014 release; 106 min.) brings the story of Margaret and Walter Keane, and the artistic brouhaha surrounding the ""big eyes"" children's paintings. As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""based on true events"", and that we are in ""Northern California, 1958"". We see Margaret take her young daughter and leave a failed marriage. By chance Margaret meets charming Walter Keane at an art fair. Walter also is a painter, mostly of Parisian street scenes, They hit it off and before we know it (and also to resist a claim from her ex that she cannot provide for her daughter), Walter and Margaret marry. Walter finds a club to show the paintings, both his and hers, and it isn't long before Margaret's paintings start selling like hot potatoes. At this point we are maybe 15-20 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is probably the most 'conventional' movie from Tim Burton, in the sense that we are getting a fairly straight-forward storyline of the improbable partnership (commercial and otherwise) between Margaret and Walter Keane. The key scenes of the movie for me were to see how Margaret, who poured so much of herself into those paintings, ultimately acquiesced to let Walter take the credit for the paintings. I think it's important to point out that this story takes place in the late 50s/early 60s, thus more than half a century ago, when the role of women in society was far from what it is today. Second, as much as I love Amy Adams, and she certainly does great work again in the role of Margaret, I was completely blown away by the performance of Christoph Waltz, the Austrian actor who previously won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for ""Inglorious Bastards"". Waltz in my humble opinion has never been better than in ""Big Eyes"". Third, there are some great lines in the movie. The best one for me comes late into the movie, when Walter is desperate as he needs input from Margaret on explaining where he got the inspiration for these paintings. Replies Margaret wryly: ""Looks like you painted yourself into a corner"", ha! Fourth, kudos to the production team, as they recreate Northern Cal, and in particular San Francisco, of the late 50s/early 60s with glorious attention for details. Last but not least, there is a ton of great music in the film, including two new songs from Lana Del Rey written specifically for the movie: the fantastic ""Big Eyes"" comes midway into the movie, and the okay ""I Can Fly"" plays over the movie end titles. Be sure to stay to the end, as we get an update what happened with Walter and Margaret later in life (along with pictures of the real-life Walter and Margaret).

This movie was been garnering positive buzz left and right. The matinee screening where I saw this at in Fort Myers was attended okay but not great. I'm hopeful that perhaps with a couple of Oscar nominations this movie can find some legs in the theaters. Bottom line: Tim Burton delivers a highly engaging and entertaining, if conventional (by Burton's standards), movie with ""Big Eyes"", aided along the way by two great lead performances (of which Waltz's is the better). If you have a chance to check out ""Big Eyes"", be it in the theater, or on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd suggest you do so and draw your own conclusion. ""Big Eyes"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1419897600,107,3455,4.6996699669967

Press Release:  Official Statement by Susan Hale Keane, Daughter of Walter Stanley Keane

Born in 1947, I am Susan Keane, daughter of Barbara and Walter Keane.

Following the traumatic death of my brother Stanley, and a highly successful joint venture in real estate, throughout the late 40s and early 50s, my parents and I lived in post WW2 Europe, while maintaining a home in Berkeley, California, designed by Julia Morgan, built in 1906.

During that time, my mother, in pursuit of a PhD, studied cooking at Le Cordon Bleu, fashion design with couturiers including Edwar Sene, and Universitt Heidelberg, while my father studied painting at cole des Beaux-Arts and L'Acadmie de la Grand Chaumire in Paris.

Initially speaking an amalgamation of 5 languages, I learned to draw and paint alongside my father from an early age.

During 1949, in the ballroom of our Berkeley mansion ""Elmwood House"", I watched my parents create, ""Susie Keane's Puppeteens"", ""big eyed"" wooden puppets, hand painted by Walter, with clothing designed and sewn by Barbara. Adorned in an ornately illustrated box, accompanied by a book and language record set, these sold in San Francisco, New York and London, at high end department and toy stores including Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, I Magnin and FAO Schwartz, as seen in this 1951 edition of UK's House & Garden magazine.

In 1950 my mother Barbara became department head of dress design at UC Berkeley, while Walter painted full time. I observed my father's friendship with Berkeley painter Robert Watson to be a profound influence on both my own and Walter's evolving style, as he shifted his early focus from street scenes and nudes, to ominous ethereal imagery of exaggerated perspective.

After my parents filed for divorce in 1953, my father and I met Peggy (Margaret Doris Hawkins Ulbrich), during an exhibition of Walter's paintings.

At that time, Mrs Ulbrich, a former New York baby furniture factory worker, made her living painting names on neckties, in cooperation with her husband Frank, supplemented by quick realistic portrait sketches of passers by at street fairs. None of her work to date had ""big eyes"".

Soon, Mrs Ulbrich moved in with my father, and he took her on as his ""Eliza Doolittle"" and artistic apprentice.

Later, Mrs Ulbrich filed for a divorce from her husband Frank, and swiftly married my father in 1955. Her daughter Jane moved in, and she and Margaret learned to paint under my father's tutelage. I witnessed the evolution of their artistic process.

Walter encouraged Margaret to develop a style beyond realism, educating and immersing her in the works of old masters for inspiration. She was a slim brunette, wearing a blonde wig. Her initial art consisted of idealized self portraits of slender ladies exclusively featuring small almond shaped eyes, like her own.

My father would often impart to us, his vast knowledge of color, perspective, texture, artistic techniques, art history, etc, repeatedly impressing upon us, the vital impact of ""the eyes"". His guidance made a strong impression on me as my own work evolved.

My father was an avid photographer, using a cutting edge Hasselblad. A very large opaque projector was purchased for Margaret, set up in a dark room adjoined to the sunny painting studio. With this tool, a highly detailed image could be projected on canvas from a photograph. A skilled illustrator, Margaret was able to trace a portrait in 15 minutes. This projection method has frequently been utilised in art forgery, as it facilitates replication of fine brush strokes.

Though her initial paintings were primitive, Margaret demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for mimicry, and quickly learned to paint with exceptional precision.

While her execution was flawless, Margaret never showed any aptitude for originality, and her main body of work consisted of Modigliani pastiches blended with other borrowed influences, supplemented by a series of commissioned photorealistic portraits.

My father, beginning with his established bar scene series, occasionally engaged her new found skills to assist him on paintings entirely of his own concept, design and creative authorship. He openly publicised her contributions to his works, proudly promoting her name. Their artist/assistant relationship was never a secret during the years they worked together, their early collaborative works signed ""Margaret and Walter KEANE"" and MW KEANE, with independent works signed W KEANE and KEANE, M Keane and MDH Keane.

Margaret used very soft sable brushes, along with a sable fan brush to blend her colours. This results in a very thin layer of paint (no texture) which takes only few days to dry. From early on, it was disclosed to the press that Margaret added supplementary brush strokes to the figures of some of Walter's paintings.

Over time, she adopted his ""big eye"" motif, gradually incorporating it into her own Modigliani-style work.

As a professional fine oil painter, intimately familiar with the historic body of work for both artists, and a first hand witness to the creation and evolution of these works, I am uniquely qualified to offer an artistic analysis of the autonomous and collaborative elements of the works of Margaret McGuire and Walter Keane. I also had the opportunity to examine Walter's work in great detail while performing an archival restoration of ""Alone"" in the late 80s.

Much of Walter's work predominantly features rough textured brush strokes and imperfections, often using a palette knife, a conscious and deliberate use of contrasting cool and warm colour scheme, exaggerated perspective that stretches on to infinity, sparse asymmetrical balanced composition with clean silhouettes emphasizing negative space, the background frames the subject and draws the viewer's eye using leading lines, use of strong shadow and highlight.

Margaret's work features smooth blended precision brush strokes, a rainbow of primary colors, flat two dimensional backgrounds, crowded symmetrical composition, the subjects are homogenous with the background, the dense background interrupts competes and merges with the overlapping subjects, monotone lighting, understated or void of shadows.

Walter's work is also structurally and stylistically distinct from Margaret's later homages attempting to approximate his art.

More importantly however, it is vital to mention that Walter was not a violent man, nor a bully. If anything, he was the most joyful and gentle person I've known. Margaret's depiction of death threats, discord and abuse are entirely fictitious. Though, I have no doubt my father's philandering was a high price for her to pay for fame and affluence.

Towards the end of Walter and Margaret's marriage, my father met Joan on a United Airlines flight to New York.

Upon learning of his courtship, a woman scorned, Margaret promptly moved to Hawaii in 1964 with married father of 10, publicist/reporter Dan McGuire. The next year, 1965, Walter and Margaret divorced. Following Dan's divorce, Margaret remarried in 1966.

In 1969 Walter married Joan. I had been exceptionally close to my father up to that point. I heard little from him thereafter. Their daughter Chantal was born in 1970, followed by the birth of their son Sascha in 1973. My heartbreak over this abrupt transition led to our estrangement, which lasted the majority of his remaining years. I can only imagine Margaret's false claims stem from a similar bitter heartbreak, financial distress, or both.

Regardless of their personal differences, compelling each to later discredit the other, Walter, was indeed the one to initially conceive and create ""big eye"" art, long before he met Margaret. First and foremost, he was an ideas man. From his crude beginnings, Margaret's blossoming technical skills contributed to an evolved quality that celebrated his vision, and together they manifested a result which commercially exceeded a level of success greater than what either artist was able to achieve on their own, before or since.

Though uncelebrated, Walter had a diverse body of work that expanded well beyond the confines of his ""waif"" theme.",1419811200,31,8416,5.25820895522388
6926454,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Just Great! This movie has everything. We saw it Thursday evening, Dec. 25. The story is moving with some seriously funny parts (outloud laughter.) without the character trying to be funny.

We could feel Margaret Keene's anguish. Amy Adams was wonderful. Such finesse! From the interviews with Margaret, she says that Amy Adams' performance is right on. Christoff Waltz's performance is also right-on. He doesn't skip a beat. The character required an actor that is flamboyant and could talk so fast with anyone in any station in life and come across as believable. Both actors are nominated for Golden Globes.

 Walter Keane was a con artist royale! (Not from the movie, but I read a piece about what became of him and it said that he died in 2000 and was penniless.) I bought a book about Walter Keane here on Amazon. It is on the way now.

There is a a scene when you can catch sight of Margaret Keane herself. The artists are all painting and selling their wares and the camera quickly focuses twice in the background on an elderly white haired lady sitting on a park bench reading. That is this dear lady, Margaret Keane.

She had a turning point in her life that gave her the courage to do the things she had to do so that she could go on with her life. (No spoiler.)

Margaret also has lovely paintings, posters and greeting cards available for sale from her website. (margaretkeane.com)

6926489,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Amy Adams does an excellent job as Margaret Keane, the creator of the infamous 'big eyed children' paintings of the '50s and '60s, and the film does a fine job displaying her dilemma at letting her husband Walter take credit for the paintings as they achieve worldwide fame. However, it's Waltz as the hustling, duplicitous Walter that really propels the movie. Waltz's natural energy and smarminess are perfect for the role, while Tim Burton does an excellent job recreating the jazzy atmosphere of late '50s North Beach in San Francisco. A movie, especially if you're an artist, to which you'll constantly return.",1492300800,,615,5.03921568627451
6926490,2,B00RD6DZL0,"I love Tim Burton's work, but this is not his genre; nor do I feel that Christoph Waltz was in his element.  He was perfect for his roles in Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds, but his style is too overbearing and idiosyncratic to view him as anything other than a caricature; and unfortunately, Amy Adams also comes across as a ""wifey"" caricature rather than a fully developed personality.  Burton's characters are usually terrific, but here, they seem to be yanked out of a fantasy and oddly planted in reality, creating a surreal lack of cohesiveness.  Ultimately, this biopic comes across as a misguided attempt at a dark comedy about very real fraud and domestic abuse, while barely skimming the devastating effects of marital slavery, oppression and the extent of the impact on both mother and daughter.  Personally, after this, I wouldn't feel as though I missed anything if I never saw Christoph Waltz in another movie.  Only my opinion, but this was really not my cup of tea, and I felt that an opportunity to tell a fascinating story was missed.",1491177600,3,1062,4.845303867403315

6926501,4,B00RD6DZL0,"Interesting and bizarre bio-pic. After watching it, I thought the director (Tim Burton)  must have exaggerated the story, so I looked up the true story. Turns out that most all of this film is perfectly true! The story is told rather conventionally, unlike most Burton-directed films. But, it does deal with the general idea of ""What is Art""? Do the critics know best? Or, do the masses know best? A particular answer is not given, but we can see how art gets corrupted by mass merchandising in our modern world. Also, the plight of women in the late 1950s/ early 1960s is admirably depicted. It's a far cry from today's world. The acting, sets, etc were fine. The only odd note is that Walter Keane is played by Christopher Waltz, who has an Austrian accent. The real Walter Keane was American. I think Waltz gives a good portrayal (and, according to the real Margaret Keane) he portrayed Walter Keane accurately. But, the accent was odd, and I guess he can't do a good American accent. This story was a bit far out, and I was temped to give just a 3 star review -- until I did research on the true story, and found that it was, indeed, accurate.",1487635200,,1147,4.488038277511961

There are great characters, lots of comedy along with drama, and lots of twists and turns.

6926533,5,B00RD6DZL0,"I hadn't heard of this movie when it came to theaters but I later saw trailers for it on other film DVD's. The trailers looked good so I rented it and loved the film.

The plot is very fun and funny, based on a true story (you get to meet the real character in one of the special features, which are well done). Not to give much away, the film takes place in the late 1950s and early '60s, when artist Walter Keane (played by Christoph Waltz) achieves world-wide fame and success with portraits of saucer-eyed waifs. He has essentially created ""pop art"" (before Andy Warhol) and sells posters and postcards and other merchandise of the paintings so the average person can afford to buy it, and he becomes very rich. However, no one realizes that his wife, Margaret (played by Amy Adams), is the real painter behind the brush. He is simply a good ideas man and promoter and, since women aren't taken seriously in the art world yet, he pretends to be the artist and the public buys it.

The film goes deeper and manages to critique the art world itself and question the difference between Art and (pop) art. Very funny and clever.
The acting is top-notch and visually, it looks fantastic (it's a Tim Burton film). HD Blu-ray is the best way to see it and I just bought the Blu-ray on Amazon for $8, which is a good price. There is some swearing in it but overall, it's a clean film. Highly recommended!",1479340800,,1400,4.422480620155039

It's a hoax within a hoax. Margaret doesn't paint either. Both the husband and the wife are actors in a long con. Who knows who really paints the big eyes but it's probably a fluctuating silent team. The whole thing is a media /CIA/ whoever you want to call the big behind the scenes liars -- lie.

The CIA had a strong hold on modern art -- (no doubt they still do) there was a bumbling unrest that ""real"" artists could not get gallery shows/ attention -- because somebody was controlling the whole scene and kept only the artists they controlled on people's radar. this was probably factual. Guggenheim -- first evidence. ... I think this ""performance"" of the Keans and the big eyes had multiple agendas it served -- for one it proved an artist of the people could gain success without the ""controlled"" Galleries. (never mind this underdog was completely controlled and a double fraud) But -- their massive success disproved the claim that success was withheld for only those artists favored by establishment. but it was a deception. control was omnipresent. -- next the disgusting connection to UNICEF , who claims to help children while pushing them further into poverty world wide -- , the images themselves - being nothing but the romanticization and objectification of suffering children and poverty -- just super sicko stuff.  esp for the super wealthy of the world to be celebrating, and urging the public at large to obsess over. it's really quite sinister, wrapped as cute. the only thing they had going for them was this weird shaming of the US -- see! you do like woman artists now you have to admit it - twist at the end. I guess that's the sweet we get with so much sour.

6926548,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Big Eyes is a great departure for Tim Burton. After a string of fanciful and imaginative, but artistically spotty, explorations in film imagery (Dark Shadows anyone?), Tim Burton has delivered a conventional, enjoyable and watchable movie about Margaret Keane, the illustrator of those little children with the enormous, expressive, eyes which were so poplar during the 60s. It is a penetrating study of the relationship Margaret Keane had with her husband, Walter Keane. The movie is basically the story of Margarets life.

Margaret is played by Amy Adams. Amy never disappoints, and she does not disappoint here. Walter Keane is played by Christopher Waltz, who delivers another brilliant performance as Walter Keane, a first-class huckster, con and fraud.

One problem: The real Walter Keane did not speak with Waltzs Austrian accent. Check out his videos on You Tube. The real Walter Keane spoke standard English with an occasional slight inflection. If you listen carefully, he speaks with a slight Midwest inflection, a reflection of the area from which the real Walter Keane was born and raised. The real Walter Keane was a huckster, con and fraud, that part depicted in Big Eyes is true. In life, however, it appears to be he was of the one-hundred percent American variety.

Tim Burton can be excused for this exercise of artistic license. Big Eyes shows what a good director he can be when he is focused and disciplined and does not totally give in to his flights of enormous imagination.

This movie is also a good excuse to see Waltz again in action. He has an uncanny ability to dominate the screen in any role he plays.

And how fitting and ironic it is that a man like Walter Keane, a total American con in real life, should be portrayed by an actor from Europe!

This movie should not be missed.",1476230400,3,1811,4.844660194174757

6926567,4,B00RD6DZL0,"Big Eyes tells the story of one of the biggest cons to ever happened in the art world. It's the story of a couple, one being The Painter, and the other being a Confidence Man, a man who could easily talk his way into things.

It's quite fascinating as the events are based on a true story. The believability is brought to life by the shy housewife (Amy Adams), who goes along with her husband's (Christoph Waltz) plans. As with most cons, you can only lie and keep up that lie for so long. As an artist, I understood why the wife went along with it. Heck, I would too if he was bringing in the big bucks. But as an artist grows up, they do desire and deserve proper recognition.

Waltz plays a charming husband whose lies increasingly become grander and at some point he starts to believe them himself, and it's then you realize you have no idea if what he's saying is the truth at all. It's a great performance. Adams does well as the shy 50s housewife, who at that time was supposed to be and act a certain way. In the end, you wonder how this genie, and the truth, will show itself out of the bottle.",1471737600,,1103,4.19811320754717

6926618,4,B00RD6DZL0,"Excellent movie based on the true story of Walter Keane (Christopher Waltz) becoming a celebrity in the late 50s by taking credit for the ""Big Eyes"" Children artwork of his wife Margaret (Amy Adams), who won a Best Actress, Musical/Comedy Golden Globe for her performance.

Margaret's conscience is bothered by the fraud and though she's a ""Methodist"", she talks to a Catholic priest in a confessional in San Francisco saying she is most bothered about lying to her daughter. In an extras interview on the disc, the real life Margaret Keane, still alive, says, ""If they're (people are) doing something wrong, admit it, turn around and start over and do the right thing.""

In addition to effectively portraying Margaret Keene's inner emotions, Amy Adams is given some memorable dialogue to deliver, including the following about her ""Big Eyes"" Children artwork early in the movie to her husband-to-be, Walter:

""I believe that you can see things in the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul. ... The eyes are how I express my emotions.""

I've read that more than 90% of communication is non-verbal. The late Catholic psychiatrist Conrad Baars (1919-1981) wrote: ""[P]eople are very little aware of the way in which their eyes mirror their inner feelings. ... for the will can mask or control the expression of the eyes only very slightly ... tender love leaves its unmistakeable mark in the expression of the eyes. The tender gaze is characterized by repose and tranquility in the delight of contemplating the good. It reflects ... the joy of love.""

In a brief role as a New York Times art critic, John Canady (Terence Stamp), says ""Art should elevate"". Indeed it should, but too much modern art drags down by denigration and even blasphemy. Do some artists try to cover up a lack of artistic talent by creating controversy? In the movie, not wanting his (mostly Margaret's) artwork to be hung by the bathrooms of a nightclub, Walter Keane says, ""When people see art they shouldn't think of s**t.""

But too often, they do. I think of the infamous ""Piss Christ"".

 St. Thomas Aquinas defined beauty as ""that which being perceived, pleases."" And, ""the nearer they (all things) are to God, the more beautiful they are.""

Artists and those interested in art will probably particularly enjoy ""Big Eyes"".",1463702400,,2301,4.894601542416453
6926619,4,B00RD6DZL0,"This is a well made biopic movie based on the artist/painter Margaret Keane.  It's a slower paced drama that may stun some viewers to believe that it was Directed by Tim Burton who is known for his offbeat, dark, gothic look in his pictures.  This one is offbeat, but the look and feel of it is the sunny 1950's where everything seems to appear happy and bright.  The dark elements are not visual, but rather emotional and at times hard to believe they had ever taken place.  This is because it's a different world now and the seemingly odd circumstance Margaret Keane finds herself in is doubtful to happen for someone today, at least not to someone famous.

For anyone that knows the story of Margaret Keane and who she is, then there really are no surprises in this movie.  It takes place during the height of her fame as a painter when she was one of the most popular artists in the country who would later inspire other famous artists.  She was known for painting exaggerated portraits of children with huge appearing eyes that are larger than life and conveying deep emotion.  The only problem is that no one knew she was the painter because her husband was committing fraud by posing as the painter publicly and in the media for ten years. Ouch.  That alone will piss someone off.

Margaret is played brilliantly by Amy Adams who hits all of the right notes in portraying someone with a sense of awareness that what her husband is doing is wrong.  Why does she not say anything?  Why does she allow it to continue?  Her silent disapproval and frustration is apparent to the viewer, but not to her husband who seems to be bouncing off the walls like a court jester deceiving everyone he comes into contact with.  The husband, Walter Keane is played by Christopher Waltz.  He's got to have done a terrific job, because most everyone that watches this film will find him irritating as he parades around publicly that he's the painter of these infamous portraits of children with Big Eyes.

There were some elements that were omitted from the film, such as when Margaret files for divorce and announces that she is the painter, there is a stage out set up by the media in a huge park to bring both Margaret and Walter together in a face off.  This would be to both paint something on the set up canvas for each.  Margaret showed up, but Walter didn't and we know why.  This was omitted as well as that Margaret later remarries a man she meets in Hawaii who in real life she says helped her to stand up to Walter.  I would think someone that important who helped her fight back would be included in this movie, but alas for whatever reason it's not.

For the most part, the movie is well done, looks great, and pays homage to a painter who never got to enjoy her fame at the height of it.  Instead she was hiding out in a basement painting 16 hours a day to make her husband more famous.  This is not picked up on the movie and should have been also.  The overall general plot may anger and frustrate others to watch as this woman is taken advantage of and yet says and does nothing.  It's a different time now and what Margaret was experiencing would likely not happen today.  This was happening in the late 1950's and early 1960's when women took a back seat to their husband.  Divorce was still frowned upon and a woman setting up on her own was seen as controversial.  You would be an outcast.  The emotions conveyed in this movie are relatable today, but not the conditions Margaret Keane was in, so it will anger many viewers who may just see her as weak, pathetic, and a doormat.  This may make it a difficult watch for those who prefer their lead protagonist in stories to not be a victim.  If it's any consolation, she rises to that challenge, but for the viewer it may be too late.",1463443200,2,3793,4.422190201729107

6926719,1,B00RD6DZL0,"It's a great story but a  terrible film. I can't think of one good thing to say about it.  Spoilers ahead. The real problem, apart from an eye-rolling performance from Waltz, is the screenplay. What makes this weak woman paint these images? Why are the children so sad? In real life, children, unless they're in dire circumstances, aren't always sad. I've seen some of the happiest children in the world in countries where they have nothing the West takes for granted. Christoph Waltz's character can obviously paint, even if his paintings are just as bad as his wife's, so where did he get the French images from if he never went to Paris? Photographs? Did someone else paint them? So if he can paint, why would he put water color over oil? Water color just WON'T go over oil. And if he did paint the Paris pictures he could easily have observed his wife's basic process to paint these child like pictures himself. It's such a great story, but it's a bad film. Even Amy Adams can't save this.",1451174400,,993,4.5418994413407825

Her husband, who knew nothing about art or painting took credit for all of her works. Due to her lack of confidence in her abilities, she allowed  him to do so for many years.

Finally she put an end to his scheme, and resumed taking credit for what was rightfully hers. Meanwhile, her husband, who obviously has some type of personality disorder sees nothing wrong with what he's done.

Ed Wood, Big Fish, and Big Eyes are among his finer works, though Edward Scissorhands will always be a sentimental favorite.  The performances are top notch - Amy Adams in particular has never been better, and of course the cinematography is gorgeous.  Also surprising was how the themes of the film resonate with present day issues.  While Walter Keane (played by Christophe Waltz) is an alpha-chode, the film is actually quite egalitarian in its treatment of him... In a sense giving him credit where it's due with respect to Margaret Keane's career.",1449014400,,659,5.018348623853211

6926754,3,B00RD6DZL0,"I saw Big Eyes yesterday, and there are some surprising parallels with Birdman. In fact, some of the lines are almost the same (they address the same artist/critic relationship.)

Big Eyes is not a fantasy other than it takes place in that bright color Edward Scissorhands Universe, where buildings are chosen for their pastel hues and even landscapes are heavily touched up with CGI to a wholly artificial green. There are also a few hallucinatory moments that follow up and build up artificially made up (random) people to maximize the big eye effect.
Unfortunately for Big Eyes the movie is too superficial, broad and scattershot.

Christoph Waltz has been criticized for his bad acting, but if there is anything in the movie at all, it is because he brings it in. A more low key choice would not have worked at all.
The fault is probably not so much the acting as the writing and direction. The lack of focus on one or the other of the Keanes is also a problem. Chose one then follow him or her (the movie jumps from one to the other): Mr. Keane is clearly the more interesting character and the obvious choice (even if maybe he is too one-note. But since the events depicted are not likely to be a surprise to the audience, why even bother to pretend they are?) Mrs. Keane remains a cypher throughout, having chosen her perspective is either a mistake or it was ultimately not sufficiently insightful: by the end we still have no idea what makes her tick.

Growing up in the 70s I was naturally aware of the Big Eyes phenomenon (posters, note books, sticker, etc.) I just never realised that there was an actual originator to the style or that it was supposed to actually be even a blip of any sort on the Art radar.  It just seems a sort of creepy adolescent girl appeal fad, and the movie even addresses this (in words spoken by Mrs Keane, no less.)
Even then, my response to the events depicted in the movie, was 'Even if this was a sort of fraud, who really cares?' Being a fan of horror and bad films, I actually do care about the  subject of Ed Wood, so I guess, just in the same manner there must be someone out there who is a fan of the Big Eyes...

This is probably Burton's following up on themes of incompetent taste in Art from Ed Wood and even Beetlejuice, but at this time, and immediately following up on Birdman, if feels to me as if it might just be that Birdman and Big Eyes both betray a common fear of successful adults or professionals (in this case painters/actors/directors) of being exposed as frauds.
Is that ultimately what these films are about?",1446422400,,2577,4.472340425531915

6926791,4,B00RD6DZL0,"I gave this movie a 4 star because the acting was excellent.  It is based on the true story of the woman who painted the iconic Keane's - most know these works as children and pets with ""big eyes"".  I remember when my father brought home some prints, probably in the early 1960s - they were possibly one of the most popular works of the time and I now have them on my own wall.  I wouldn't say this was an uplifting movie but it definitely tells a story of how some women were treated in mid-century as well as how the paintings became such a phenomenon.  It's not riveting - as a story I would give it 3 stars - but it was interesting, especially, I would think, for those of us who grew up with her pictures on our walls.",1445472000,,723,4.070422535211268

6926802,1,B00RD6DZL0,"""based on a true story"" yet not a single scene or line of dialogue rings true (nor are they amusing, unfortunately). Seems to me he took credit because a male artist (like a male cook) was instantly taken more seriously, plus he had more personality. She went along with it, they made a fortune, after divorce she wanted revenge and rightful credit. Burton twists it into some white slave tale that rings entirely false. Waltz is hammy and goofy, Amy so uninteresting she practically vanishes. I had no knowledge of the facts (I just now checked in with  Wikipedia) but I sat there the whole time going ""she never said that.....he never said that....that never happened....""",1444780800,2,674,4.810344827586207

I did read one reviewer who thought the lead character was dumb and weak ... my response to that is the reviewer obviously has know idea how women were treated, viewed or what society expected of them in the 1950's and '60's.  I thought the actors did well.  The storyline is kind of hard to talk about because I have no idea how much of it is based in facts, and how much of it has been ""Hollywoodized"" but it kept me watching, so I guess that's what counts.

6926843,4,B00RD6DZL0,"This movie is based on a true story.  I couldn't decide what term would best describe the wife, played by Amy Adams...stupid? spineless? gullible? loyal? fearful?...because, in reality, she demonstrates all of these characteristics.  I had to keep in mind, however, that the story takes place in the 1960s, a time when women were socially powerless and purposely naive;  a more appropriate word to describe her, then, might be typical.  For instance, if a woman in those days said, ""I am an artist"" most people would have ignored her claims.  But what if she said, ""I am an artist and my husband is getting rich by taking credit for my work"" ?  Chances are good that people would have accused her of lying or being crazy.  Everyone knew that men were more talented than women.  Still, that is the central argument in this story, that she is the artist and he is a bully and a liar who pretends her creations are his, and, the worst part is, people believe him.  The dilemma is, what's she going to do about it?  I really like Amy Adams and Christopher Waltz (him in Water for Elephants and Jango; her in Junebug, Enchanted, and everything else she's done), but because of the plot, the only part of this movie that did not drive me nuts was the ending.  I can't decide if that was because the acting was so good, which it was, or the situation was so disturbing, which it was. I mean you can't make something that truly is awful not be awful.  Furthermore, awful stories need to be told so that they don't happen again and again.  I'm not suggesting that this mtvie wasn't worth making or watching.  I'm just saying that if you are someone who hates movies that make you want to strangle the protagonist our of sheer frustration, you might not like it. If you don't care what happens as long as the acting is good and you enjoy the ending, however, you might like it a lot.",1442448000,7,1873,4.454545454545454

That peaked my curiosity and the film answered my questions and told the story.  By the time the scandal became known, I was on to other things.

6926910,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Big Eyes isn't like your typical Time Burton film, but that doesn't mean your not going to enjoy it, just something you need to be aware of going in. Big Eyes is based on a true story, and to play devil's advocate, the real life guy who was the husband isn't alive anymore to defend or give his side of the story. The guy did go to his grave claiming he did paint the big eyes paintings, whereas the movie certainly takes the wife's version of events, so that's what we have here, her story.  The story of how a woman on the run with her young daughter from a violent relationship, meets a man who she thinks is a fellow artist who cleverly gets their work exposed to the general public.  Only the problem is no one is interested in his French street scapes, all the interest is in these portraits of creepy kids with huge eyes.  The buyers assume he painted them and he does nothing to correct that assumption.  Eventually the lie has been played out that it seems impossible for both of them not to go along with it.

It's a simple movie, there's no explosions, gun battles or car chases, just a story to tell, that is told well!",1440288000,,1131,4.266355140186916

6926914,4,B00RD6DZL0,"The Blu-Ray itself is unremarkable, as the extras didn't interest me.  This was the first Tim Burton movie I missed seeing in the theaters due to having a newborn baby, so when it went on sale on Amazon I picked it up at a good price.  I love Tim Burton movies, and while this one didn't disappoint, it didn't have the whimsical and ""wacky"" feeling that a movie in his universe stirs up.  There were a few scenes (the dream sequence with the Big Eyes in the grocery store) that really made it feel like a Burton movie, but overall it felt like he was trying too hard to be ""mainstream"".  Amy Adams was good, and Christoph Waltz was excellent (although his American accent just wasn't cutting it, and I had to pretend he was European throughout), but it didn't make me want to watch it again immediately if ever.  This is certainly a step above Alice in Wonderland and Planet of the Apes, but it certainly wasn't nearly as endearing as Ed Wood or Big Fish.  I really had high hopes that it would be as enjoyable as the rest of his films, and I was a little bit let down. I'd definitely say it was worth the watch though!",1439856000,,1119,4.279620853080568

6926919,4,B00RD6DZL0,ACTUALLY LUVED THE PAINTINGS..INTERESTING TO KNOW BACKGROUND!!,1439683200,,62,8.0
6926920,3,B00RD6DZL0,"This is the ""based on factual events"" story of surrounding Margaret and Walter Keane and the kitschy ""big eyes"" paintings of children that were popular in the 50s and 60s. Amy Adams portrays Margaret,  a recently separated single mother who wants to make a life for herself and her daughter by any means she can.  She has a knack for painting portraits of children (the first are mostly of her daughter Jane in variations) and sells her work, and her portrait skills on the streets of San Francisco at various artist sidewalk fairs. Here she meets the charmer and landscape artist (who only seems to paint pictures of Paris) Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) and the two start dating. When Margaret receives a letter from her ex-husband,  threatening the custody of her daughter,  Walter proposes that they marry to solve her single-phase not issues. Trying to push his work, Walter begins to display both his and Margaret's work side by side in a nightclub.  When interest in Margaret's ""big eyes"" paintings starts to surface, Walter quickly takes credit for their creation. Year pass and the popularity of the portraits emerges into a mult-imillion-dollar fad with Walter quickly becoming one of the most beloved artist/celebrities around. Margaret is bullied and harassed and led to believe that she must keep the secret that she is the real creator a secret or the empire will come crashing down around them. But has she ever seen Walter paint anything? She discovers the truth about her conniving husband in a crate filled with Paris street scenes painted by someone who signs them S. Cenic.

The movie is entertaining but there is very little real drama. Never once does Waltz turn into Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining"" like he should. Even when he's threatening to kill off his wife if she rats them out isn't even slightly uncomfortable. All in all Walter's lack of ferocity tends to leave us with the distinct impression that Adam's character is a complete pushover through most of the movie. Even the drunken rampage scene with Walter flicking lit matches at Margaret and her daughter, chasing them through the the house where they lock themselves away in the studio filled with ""big eyes"" portraits in varying degrees of completion ends lamely with them retreating out the sliding glass door and into the safety of the car. Ho hum. Burton might need to take a minute and remember how to build drama or suspense or anything.  Perhaps he's just so big nowadays that no one has the cajones to tell him to tighten up his craft. The biggest problem I had with Big Eyes wasn't it's overall lack of drawing me completely in or its lackluster,  often boring first half, but the fact that Tim Burton left no impression on this film at all. I could've been the director as far as the movie-watching world is concerned.  Not a single shred of Burtonesque charm. Nothing. Nada. Did he do this film as a favor to someone?  It just seem stretched in places and rushed everywhere else. Still an entertaining watch, like ibsaid, but it could have been punchier and it could have been directed by anyone.",1439683200,,3096,4.791744840525328

It stars Amy Adams as Margaret together with Chris Waltz as the Walter,the credit-grabbing husband. The story follows the couple when they first meet,their marriage,the success they achieved with their paintings,their divorce and a lawsuit that finally revealed Margaret as the real painter behind all the works at the conclusion of the film.

Burton managed to create a great film. It starts with the great performance of the lead stars - Adams and Waltz- who has shown great chemistry as the Keane couple. Also,it touched on the themes on feminism and sexual politics during the 1950's and 1960's when women considered not at par with men as well as the character transformation of Margaret from being submissive wife into becoming an aggressive woman who started to learn how to fight. Added to that,we also got to see the world of deception in the world of arts which has been happening for many years now. Overall,Big Eyes delivers due to great performances of the talent involved and being a social commentary.",1438819200,,1230,4.970873786407767

6927026,5,B00RD6DZL0,"This is my first Tim Burton film that I immensely enjoyed. I like ""Big Eyes"" because it is so unlike his other films. It's conventional and based on a true story, and what a story it is! Wow. Amy Adams delivers a knockout performance as real-life painter, Margaret Keene. Her performance is both delicate and fierce. In the beginning of the film, Margaret flees with her young daughter, Janie from her smothering husband. Margaret is a gifted but struggling artist. Her paintings are unique and one-of-a-kind (she draws waifs with large, almond shaped-eyes). She eventually meets and falls in love with a fellow struggling artist, Walter Keene (played by Christoph Waltz). After a brief courtship, Walter and Margaret decide to wed. This where things get interesting, plot-wise. Walter is not who he seems, he's a habitual, shameless liar and con-artist. He deceives Margaret at every turn. He betrays Margaret in the worst way - he convinces people he painted the ""big eyes"" portraits. Walter takes credit for Margaret's work (sick, I know). He uses his charm and marketing ability, and he quickly becomes an international success in the art world. Margaret is beyond angry but she goes along with the lie to protect her daughter's future and her sham of a marriage. I really enjoyed this film. Amy Adams is a powerhouse. She's one of my favorite actors. She has incredible range. I wish I could say the same for Christoph Waltz. I've enjoyed him in other films but I felt his performance in ""Big Eyes"" was way too animated and over-the-top. I'm sure it was intentional but I found it very distracting and irritating at times. Less is more. But I highly recommend ""Big Eyes"". It's shocking how long Walter and Margaret held on to this lie for. Enjoy!",1436832000,,1751,4.84
6927027,3,B00RD6DZL0,"Margaret Keane is supposed to be a victim. Her husband defrauded the public for years by taking credit for her art and selling it as his. But its hard to feel sorry for her because she went along with it for financial gain in 1950s America, where women artists weren't taken seriously.

Sexual equality is a major theme in this slightly campy biography, which, with its simple (straightforward) storyline, serves as one of Tim Burtons more cohesive, thus enjoyable, movies. Its called Big Eyes, by the way, because of the peculiar way Keanes art depicts the faces of its kid subjects.

6927113,5,B00RD6DZL0,Exceptional acting makes this compelling story an experience.  I did some research after watching the movie and found that the writers and screenplay editors did a very realistic and accurate account of this true story as told by Margaret Keane.  There were one or two things that were added to help tell the story such as Margaret's Friend but overall they seemed to stay pretty true to the story.  I would recommend this to young adults and adults alike.  I remember buying one of these posters when I was in college and then later reading some of the court case facts but had no idea of the extent of this story.  I think that it has great merit.,1435363200,,649,4.466101694915254

It manages to deliver a unique story with a special performance by the manipulative, mentally deranged and delusional antagonist.  The ultimate payoff at the end highlighted how easy it was for the artist to paint, chain-smoking in her sleep or rather with her big sad eyes, wide shut and ship out her work as a settlement to her joke of an ex husband who remained a violent sociopath until his dying day.",1435017600,,789,4.844444444444444

6927211,5,B00RD6DZL0,"I don't know why this very significant film, telling the story of one of the most outrageous personal and  artistic frauds ever
perpetrated, got such short shrift from the media and the motion picture academy. It is so well done on so many levels; the acting, writing, directing, designing. It is worth seeing for nothing more than the expert recreation of San Francisco's North Beach as it was in the 1950s. The Production Designer certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for that. Worthy of far more public and insdustry attention, there were the remarkably nuanced acting performances by Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz and a fine supporting cast; a witty and insightful script vigorously directed by Tim Burton and as always in Burton films, a great score. This film stayed in the theaters for what seemed like a minute or two and was all but ignored by the public. I think it is one of the most highly underrated films to come out in a long time. It deserved a much wider audience and far more industry recognition.",1433721600,2,1017,4.745762711864407

Because it's a Tim Burton film, I know that it would be a bit strange, but was surprised that the weirdness came from the story and not the sets, casting, or costumes, like most of Burton's films.

6927256,4,B00RD6DZL0,"This movie is based on real events and tells the story of artists Margaret Keane. The movie is good but very slow, it sure drags at times. Amy Adams gives a demure performance full of character and charm as the leading role, while Christoph Waltz is over the top and antsy. This combination works well to bring the story to life. This movie takes place in the late 50's and the retro scenery is eye candy, I loved it. It is the story of deceit, intrigue and a woman's fight to be recognized as an artist, as well as an independent and capable person.",1432944000,,550,4.298076923076923

6927266,3,B00RD6DZL0,"Its OK.  The scenario regarding how the lead character Walter Keane took credit for Margaret Keane's work was weak and not acted very well, it did not seem believable.  There is so much about psychological and emotional control that could have been included but was missing.  It came off as phony.  Also, Chris Waltz, although brilliant in Inglorious Basterds and Django, seemed to be still playing those same characters in this film too.  I'd like to see him act in a different role.

Both stars did a stellar job with their parts and lines, but it took quite a period of time for the movie to get to a point (Court Room battle) where your interest was finally tapped and there seem to be consequences that would evolve.  Not a movie that will fit everyone's taste.  Amy Adams received a nomination for best actress award.  Her co-star Christopher Waltz was not nominated for Best Actor but probably should have been.",1432944000,,506,4.651685393258427
6927270,3,B00RD6DZL0,Something about this story of a woman being taken advantage of by a man and then breaking free resonates with me.

If she allowed this to happen for so long, she got what she deserved. Also it seemed like the movie really dragged on.

I love Tim Burton, and perhaps if he'd made this film 20 years ago, it would have been brilliant.  He and Amy Adams do offer glimpses of that never truly shines through. The script and remaining cast offer far less.  Christoph Waltz brings nothing to the screen, and in fact takes what life there may be out of each scene.  I understand his character is meant to be superficial, but even those people have something going on inside, be it fear, greed, paranoia or anything.

6927357,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Director: Tim Burton

Writers: Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski

Cast: Amy Adams, Cristoph Waltz, Krysten Ritter, Danny Houston, and Terence Stamp

It bears mentioning that a conspicuous number of recent films have had a stolen painting premise at the core of their storylines. The Grand Budapest Hotel as well as the yet to be released Mortdecai, and Woman in Gold all feature this curious fad woven into their cinematic fabric. Now, Tim Burtons Big Eyes ups the number to four within a years time, and while Im not sure how long audiences are expected to relate to this bazaar trend, Big Eyes does nothing to discourage it.

Big Eyes tells the story of painter, Margaret Hawkins Keane (Amy Adams), who after being stifled by a bad marriage in 1950s Tennessee, moves with her young daughter to San Francisco in the hopes of starting a new life as an artist. There, she meets Walter Keane (Cristoph Waltz). Keane is everything Margaret had ever dreamed of: kind, romantic, charismatic, and an artist. Within months, Margaret falls for Keane and marries him, much to the chagrin of Margarets friend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter). Now both officially Keanes, Margaret begins signing her distinctive paintings of waif girls with characteristically oversized saucer-sized eyes with her new surname. When Walter finds that Margarets waif-girl paintings begin to catch on as his dull Parisian cityscapes remain unnoticed, Walter assumes responsibility for all paintings signed Keane including Margarets. While Margaret is unhappy about Walters actions, his showmanship and charisma result in outrageous sales as long as Margaret can keep churning out paintings. Now knee-deep in fraudulent activity and smothered by her husband, Margaret feels she has no choice but to obey Walter and hand over her paintings and subsequently her humanity.

Waltz and Adams shine in Big Eyes. Both actors have cemented themselves as major players who elevate each film they are a part of, and this is no exception. Alexander and Karaszewskis screenplay give both actors plenty of options for developing the tumultuous relationship. Adams embodies Margaret Keanes struggle with respect and realism. While a victim of both time and circumstance, Adams does not let Keane entirely off the hook, in terms of the choices she made. Additionally Waltz does not allow Walter to sink into stereotype. In one particularly powerful scene, Walter goes toe to toe with an art critic played by Terence Stamp. Walter cannot take Stamps criticism even though he is technically not even the painter, which unbeknownst to both is precisely what Stamp is really criticizing.

While Big Eyes is an enjoyable film and a remarkably well acted one, it is basically a semi-complex tale of plagiarism. What makes this film most fascinating and intriguing is that it is a Tim Burton film. Burton, a director known for his dark, Gothic tales of oddity and peculiarity presents a film washed with sunshine and kissed by puppy dogs. Its as if Tim Burton slapped his name on a Frank Capra picturewhich is exactly the point! Burton brilliantly presents a film that bares his name but looks like it was created by another hand, skillfully mirroring his films thematic message and ironically creating perhaps his oddest and darkest film yet in the process. When David Lynch was selected to direct Disneys The Straight Story in 1999, it certainly raised an eyebrow, but Lynch still maintained his ominous style even with a Disney film. Here, Burton purposefully adjusts his style going as far as having his reliable composer, Danny Elfman score the film with an uncharacteristically traditional score. I love the choices Burton makes with this film, all of which aid in leading up to the wonderfully absurd and enjoyable climax that really showcases Crisoph Waltzs comedic chops.

Not that the film does not retain a few Burton trademarks. A clever black and white scene involving Walter on TV is oddly reminiscent of a similar scene from Edward Scissorhands and the Big Eyes motif is used to strange effect (fittingly, Amy Adams and Krystan Ritter have the biggest eyes this side of Christina Ricci and Amanda Seyfried). This is a film that has a lot to offer, plenty to analyze, and much to enjoy. However, it will certainly not be everybodys canvas of choice; but this film, like Keanes art itself, is nothing if not subjective. A-

6927424,2,B00RD6DZL0,"""Big Eyes"" is the story of Walter and Margaret Keane, an annoying, alcoholic, liar (Walter / Adolph /Christoph Waltz) and the woman who lets him steal millions of dollars from her before she moves to Hawaii and is forced to confront him by the teachings of a bunch of religious fanatics who keep pestering her (the money didn't hurt either).

The story starts in 50's clich suburb but quickly moves to 50's clich California city. Once Margaret has abandoned her ""oppressive"" and ""stifling"" and ""other 50's clich"" suburban life she totally doesn't blossom in the big city. But she has a daughter (Jane) to support so she takes a job in the most ridiculous furniture factory in the world and sells her early Big Eye paintings in the park on weekends because, even in the 50's, nobody could afford to live in San Fran without at least 2 revenue streams. Her daughter BTW, (played by Delaney Raye) is the most interesting character in the whole movie and the only one you won't want to punch by the end of the film. But, don't worry; the director almost immediately replaces her with a cardboard cutout of a teenager (played by Madeleine Arthur). Oh and by the way: WE GET IT, IT SUCKED TO BE A WOMAN IN THE 50s.

Anyway, while selling her kitschy paintings at the park Margaret meets a young Adolf Hitler who sweeps her off her feet with his super sexy German accent, beatnik wardrobe, desperate and annoying personality and bad motel art paintings of the Paris he invaded in the 40s. She decides to marry him to piss of her ex-husband and screw him out of a relationship with his daughter.

Adolf is sick of selling California real estate to suckers and aspires to become an artist. But, as the Vienna art college quite correctly told him, he has no talent. And so, he decides to lock his new wife in a closet and force her to chain smoke cigarettes in a non-ventilated room until she creates the 60s equivalent of Thomas Kinkade paintings. He then, very successfully, flogs said paintings through a process of shameless self-promotion, un-paid celebrity endorsements and physical violence.  In the process he also neglects to tell anyone that it was Margaret who painted them, taking full credit himself for the avalanche of kitsch coming out of the smoke filled closet.

When the money starts rolling in, Adolf starts treating Margaret and Jane like its 1939 and they're Poland and Czechoslovakia respectively. So the ladies skip town after the lamest arson/murder attempt ever (Seriously! We already know that room has another door, why are you acting like you're trapped in there!?) and bug out to Hawaii forreasons.

Once in Hawaii, Margaret is lonely and so is taken advantage of by a group of religious fanatics who are very interested in helping a new convert recover millions of dollars in potential donations. So, she finally decides to tell the actual truth rather than aiding and abetting her fraud of an ex-husband.  In the movie, as in real life, the judge isn't very good at his job.  So he decides that the outcome of the case will hinge on who paints a better Big Eye painting.  Margaret paints a picture of the Judge in a dress, something which (surprise!) the Nazi Mastermind cant do. YAY, Margaret wins the millions just in time to see her artwork completely disappear from the American art scene and art history much like thousands of other fads whose time came and went. All of which would have been OK except that Walter never actually paid her.

6927456,4,B00RD6DZL0,"It feels like forever since Tim Burton brought a new movie to the screen. While its only been 2 years since both FRANKENWEENIE and DARK SHADOWS came out, both didn't fare well at the box office. So hes been due to release a film that satisfied both fans and the box office. While his latest released pleased fans it remained a box office blip rather than a hit. Thats a shame because this new movie was really quite enjoyable.

BIG EYES is in reference to those famous pictures of children with huge eyes that were all the rage in the late fifties/early sixties. It seemed like youd find them everywhere. After watching this film youll know why. Youll also know more about the artist behind those paintings and the life she led.

The film opens as Margaret Ulbrich (Amy Adams) leaves her husband with her daughter in tow, heading for California and better opportunities. While were never presented the reason why we have to assume things were pretty bad at home since the fifties were a time when a woman leaving her husband was looked down upon. Upon arriving in California Margaret takes on a job and on the weekends sets up to paint, her reel passion, along the sidewalks of a park in San Francisco. There she meets a fellow painter by the name of Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz). After charming his way into her heart, the two marry.

With dreams of making it big in the art world, Walter peddles his painting where he can but doesnt get much attention in the local galleries. He eventually rents wall space from a nightclub owner which ends up being the halls leading to the bathrooms. A fight that gets caught on film brings attention to him and the club owner. As they say there is no such thing as bad publicity. The odd thing is that while both paintings by Walter and Margaret are on the walls it is her pictures that are selling.

With the success of her paintings selling, the cash flow builds. Walter convinces Margaret that the world needs to believe that he is the one painting her pictures though, it being a mans world at the time and that women wouldnt be taken seriously. Thus the lies begin and the world changes for the couple. Walter eventually opens his own gallery offering the public the paintings they crave while Margaret slaves away, hidden in their high priced home in a small room meant for nothing but her work. Even her daughter is not made aware of just who is actually painting the pictures.

As the success of the paintings increases so does Margarets unhappiness. While Walter gathers more and more attention, going in talk shows and releasing a book of the painting, Margaret remains in the dark at home getting no recognition at all. While this may seem like an extensive amount of details to offer about this movie in truth most of the story is well known, including the couples subsequent divorce and the way the judge determined who would actually be able to take credit for the paintings. While the bare bones are laid out here, its the details that make this movie work.

Burton once again captures the prim and proper feel of nostalgic suburbia that was seen so well in films like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. This is a world where women were seen but not heard, where deals were made by slick, fast talking men and where coming home to find a roast in the over was expected nightly. It is indeed a world where critics were more likely to tear apart a womans work over that of a man. But while Walter might be right about that, the success of the paintings had more to do with the actual artwork than it did with knowing who painted them. The fact that he was the highest of con men when it came to huckstering the paintings didn't add to their value and in fact much of what he did with the rights to them cheapened them in the eyes of many. And yet they were and still are found everywhere.

Bringing these two characters to life are the performances of both Adams and Waltz. Adams has played the feminine lead before but not always displaying the confusion, reluctance to stand up for herself and the sadness behind the woman who brought forth the big eyed children. Waltz has played the bad guy before but not as a charmer who claims to want the best for his family while promoting himself at the cost of selling out someone who he should hold dear. Combined they make for a perfect casting in the two lead roles.

While most would connect Burton with a weird world as seen in his films like the afore mentioned EDWARD SCISSORHANDS or BEETLEJUICE, here he makes a more mainstream movie that most would be hard pressed to connect his name with. He proves that he can do it with ease. Its nice to see him accomplish something different, something more along the lines of a mainstream movie. It made me wonder what he could do with an action franchise. The fact that he can work in both worlds hes displayed shows he is an incredible talent and that studios need to open their purse strings once again to fund his next film. While this one felt small in budget it lacked nothing and was huge in story. For myself that made this a movie Im likely to watch more than once. It was that enjoyable.",1431043200,,5129,4.478074866310161

6927475,2,B00RD6DZL0,"From the opening shots, which look cribbed from Edward Scissorhands, I knew this movie was in trouble. Director Tim Burton takes a cartoonish angle, painting nearly every scene in bright pastels. I get it, it's a movie about painters, but it is obviously the Classics Illustrated version. An overly subservient Amy Adams and a wildly overacting Christoph Waltz go through the motions, with each ""revelation"" painfully telegraphed far too early. This could have been an interesting character study: there is a lot to this story, and the Amy Adams character must have been far more psychologically damaged than portrayed here, and her husband less of a cartoonish villain and more of a con man, but that is apparently too much for Director Tim Burton. The film climaxes in a an overwrought and ridiculous courtroom scene, some of which is stolen wholesale from Woody Allen's ""Take the Money and Run"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4zP7247W7o as Christoph Waltz leaps back and forth from the witness stand while acting as his own attorney and witness. The movie presents the court case as a sort of one day even, but then, after the verdict, we hear there were 241 exhibits. Also left completely out of the film is any understanding of Margaret's first marriage and why she left, or mention of her third marriage, which occurred during the events portrayed in the film.

They enjoyed the coverage of wallpaper in the Bay Area during my early high school years and were like the radio tuned to one station that played the same song at top volume.  But, Tim Burton and Amy Adams won over the bad memories of this topic.  There are many comments about how conventional Burton is with his work on this film, but I found myself revisiting all the footage taken at the Woodside CA house because it all seemed so completely astounding as it pushed all sorts of limits with undulating reflections cast from the water and color combination that were nearly over the top but still managed to make some reference to what one might have found in a mid CA mid century home.  Burton brought out some special golden metallic-like make up for Adams to wear during her private conversation with the poodle in her studio and then the lurid yellow drinks that were the exact color of a powerful mouthwash from that era.  Maybe this is tame in some respects but, in others, it's wondrously out there.  Margaret Keane's victory over her wacky husband during a courtroom painting duel was tasty revenge!  If, for some reason, you find that the story is not holding your attention, just shift your focus to the visual stuff.  It's rich.",1430697600,,1370,4.563265306122449

I had to remind myself that this took place during the late Fifties/early Sixties when women were just starting to assert themselves, because any viewer would ask themselves why would she allow him to dominate her. Christoph Waltz's character is an interesting one. Based on other sources, he nails the quirky, obnoxious, double-crossing and lying Walter Keane. Amy Adams, in another great role, plays Margaret Keane. She goes from a friendly and an obedient wife to a vengeful woman seeking recognition for the artwork she created.

There is one little thing in the movie that I thought was incongruent for the scene's supposedly taking place in 1958 and another similar shot some years later in the chain of events.  But, it's something that someone who didn't grow up in the 50's or 60's wouldn't think of.  I'm just surprised Tim Burton missed it.",1430352000,,519,4.5

6927607,3,B00RD6DZL0,"Amy Adams is great, but there seems to be something missing from the story as well as the depiction of the relation between the two main characters.  The supposed power Walter has over Diane is just not believable.  It doesn't even seem to me that Walter's character likes women at all.  Every nuance seems very gay to me and I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and Walter to have an affair with the pool boy and I wondered why Amy Adam's character can't see how gay he seems.  something seems odd in the portrayal of Walter, something is missing from the story-line altogether, and the weirdness I expected from a Burton film isn't there beyond a few ""big eye"" hallucinations Adams' character has that seem a bit out of place.

6927616,3,B00RD6DZL0,"I saw a promotion for this film on CBS This Morning and it struck me as an odd but potentially intriguing tale.  Tim Burton right?  And since it was based on a true story and I had vivid memories of the ""Big Eyes"" craze, I rented the movie.

The film certainly has Burton's visual touch (if a little toned down) and some of the acting is in the typical Burton ""hyped up"" style.  Amy Adams gives another wonderful performance of a complex woman consumed with feelings of inadequacy, who allows herself to be dominated by a man in the initial age of feminism. There is, however, a disconnect between her realistic performance and the theatricality of the other actors more closely associated with Burton's directorial approach.  This stylistic clash detracts from the overall cohesion of the film.

Frankly I found it hard to root for a person, particularly and artist, whose self respect and lack of courage was so overwhelming inadequate that she allowed the circumstances documented in the film to occur in the first place and continue for so long.  My sense is that her capitulation served to make her a co-conspirator with her abuser.  I just could not relate.

The final sequence is interesting and fun.  But not worth the investment of time.

If you don't remember these ubiquitous images, the movie might not interest you as much.  You should still see it!  Christoph Waltz adds the perfect edge of manic craziness to an already crazy story.  (The entire story, by the way, is a nice description of how art stars are made, especially in these days of a contemporary art market at an all time high.)  I wish Amy Adams would have fleshed out Margaret Keane a bit more: she comes off as a kind of flat, one-dimensional naive good girl and possible victim/hostage. Those enormous eyes make me think she had a little more of a strange edge herself.  But that was probably the fault of the script; most Hollywood roles for women are dumb, even in Tim Burton films.

6927643,4,B00RD6DZL0,"The reaction to this film was pretty consistent; its not bad but its not great and set your expectations pretty low.  Maybe thats why I didn't hate this.  I went in expecting to see a film that was, for lack of a better word, terrible and what I got was a film that was, not great but surprisingly good.  I have issues with certain aspects of this, but overall this was not the complete letdown that I was expecting.

This isn't an awards movie, which is probably why it suffered at the hands of critics and audiences, who expected it to be just that, but its a very good biopic that tells a very interesting story.

Big Eyes tells the story of Margaret Keane, a talented woman who starts her journey by leaving her domineering husband, taking her daughter by the hand, and falling into the arms of a con artist posing as a successful painter.  Walter Keane knows how to spin a tall tale, how to attract attention and how to manipulate your affections, and because of his persuasive nature he was able to latch onto Margaret in an attempt to exploit her for her talent.  Unbeknownst to Margaret, her husband began selling her work, passing it off as his own, and convinced her that no one would by womans work, and so he flexed his mental muscle in a way to oppress her, control her and use her.  Pulled into his lies, Margaret becomes a pawn and eventually loses all ability to speak for herself, going so far as to lie to her own daughter, who knew the truth in her heart, trying to convince everyone that Walter was the true artist.

But despite the obsessive fame that was launched because of the sight of those big eyes, Keanes work was not without naysayers, and when those naysayers got to Walters ego, he snapped, and Margaret fled.

And here is where Keanes story takes on an interesting turn, and a turn that I was actually pleasantly surprised to see Tim Burton handle so well.  You see, years after separating from Walter, Margaret was approached by Jehovahs Witnesses and it was because of their influence that she finally gained the courage to tell the truth about her story, to take back what was hers and set the record straight.  Ive known this about Keane for a long time.  Ive grown up around the Witnesses, and Ive read Keanes story and when it was announced that the film was going to be made, I was highly doubtful that this truth would even be mentioned.  I was certain that it would be omitted, but I was really shocked to see that Burton not only kept it in but made it a central plot point and addressed it with respect and not mockery.

Despite appreciating this particular approach, I have to admit that Burtons direction here is the real reason the film doesnt work entirely.  His tonal approach is so uneven that the film becomes uncomfortable in parts, and the film needed some serious editing.  The whole first two thirds becomes increasingly more and more repetitive and there are too many moments that carry a pivotal heightened atmosphere that feel as though they are going to provide a catalyst, a turn in the story, but they don't and they just continue forward on the same trajectory.  The first half of the film is just too long.  The ensemble is overall quite fine, but no one is particularly good.  Adams does a fine job but isn't given anything really strong to work with, as Margaret is played quite tonally flat.  Walter is played to the hilt by Waltz who steals every scene, but not really in a good way.  If youve seen video of the real Walter, youd know that he was a showman and a ham, but Waltz is just pigeonholing himself so much as of late that I fear for where his career is headed.

Everyone else is just there.

The sets, the costumes, the music; its all nice and works well.  I just wish that Burton has decided whether or not he wanted to make this film impactful or lightweight, because the in-between leaves this film feeling inconsistent.  I just get the impression that Burton had no idea what he wanted to do with this story.  He has made it clear that he is fascinated with her story and is in love with her work, but he allowed his own passion for her as a person to cloud his judgement as a filmmaker, I believe.

So, my final verdict is that this is a rather compelling story told adequately but that had more promise and could have used the guidance of a director who understood his own vision.",1429833600,4,4361,4.431077694235589

6927700,3,B00RD6DZL0,"There certainly is a fascinating true story here in BIG EYES. Walter Keane and his wife Margaret  and how they ""fooled"" the art world and public.  . Walter, played here by the delightful Austrian actor Christoph Waltz, claimed to be the artist who created the wildly popular 'big eyes"" paintings. In reality, they were the creations of Margaret (Amy Adams). It is a story of a talented woman being emotionally controlled by her husband and eventually breaking free.

Unfortunately, BIG EYES lacks substance and clarity at times. Although Walter was a fraud as an artist, he was an amazing salesman who made popular art accessible to the average buyer. It was an amazing stroke of marketing genius, yet the film does not delve into Walter's psyche and background to understand his motives. Maybe the deception started out innocently as portrayed in the film. The couple needed money and a few white lies at first did no harm or did it?.  Margaret fell under Walter's control but again it is not clear why she let it get so far. It is suggested that she went along willingly at first though with apprehension. She fell for Walter's story that the public wouldn't buy paintings from a woman. This is a potentially interesting story about two people in chaos after some incredible financial success. Now the secret they must keep becomes the conflict.

BIG EYES can be interesting but is rather slow moving. The real meat of the story is when Margaret finally leaves Walter, She eventually takes him to court to win her name back and finally get credit for her paintings. This part of the film is hilarious as Walter becomes his own lawyer. A fumbling Walter in court is hilarious and could have been an even bigger part of the film. Of course, there is one sure way to prove who is the real creator of ""big eyes"" and the courtroom scene is really the high point of the film.

BIG EYES was directed by Tim Burton. We have a different version of Burton than we have seen in recent years. BIG EYES is more mainstream than his other films. The style could be compared more to his film ED WOOD, yet this is more of a straightforward telling of a story. Amy Adams is delightful as always. Christoph Waltz is one of my favorite actors and he never disappoints. He is playing an American here and Waltz' English is flawless. His English can be distracting at time only because he is trying to pronounce every letter and word perfectly. Native speakers don't speak that perfectly but this is what makes Waltz a gem of an actor.
I was hoping for more in the way of extras on the DVD. I was fascinated by the story of Walter and Margaret and we do see the real Margaret Keane and the life she built after divorcing Walter. Walter died in 2000 so we don't really get any understanding of why he felt the need to pull off this hoax. BIG EYES is a fun film at times but slow moving and overall a disappointment of what it could have been.",1429574400,,2921,4.512287334593573

I remember these paintings from the actual time period but never knew the back story. The 50's with it's implied repression of women and the 60's as people found their inner power.
Tim Burton captured the zeitgeist of the 50's transitioning into the 60's. Mad Men becomes the age of Aquarius. The tones of the film are awash in color. This becomes critical given the topic of painting versus art.
Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz were amazing. Waltz possessing  the role that chews up the scenery. But it is Adams, repressed and self loathing who has the ability to submerge so deeply into character that you forget she has been a topless dancer and a nun in previous roles.

Yet I somehow confused Keane's work with Hallmark's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious-Moments/dp/B00GAA1T6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious Moments</a>&nbsp;- they had the same kitschy, inauthentic, phony quality that Tolstoy decries in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Is-Art/dp/0140446427/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Is Art?</a>&nbsp;Keane's art was popular because it moved people in some way, and it was clearly important to her; whether it is a worthwhile addition to the canon of human creative expression is subject to debate.  The film doesn't shy away from showing us what the ""establishment"" thought of it, from Jason Schwartzman's jealous gallery owner to Terence Stamp's cold-blooded art critic, who stops an attack from a fork-wielding Walter Keane with an economy worth of a Zen master.

It would be easy to take this film as an example of a domineering man taking advantage of his compliant and more talented wife, but the story is a little more complex than that.  What Margaret needed was an agent, but such a thing did not exist in 1958 for a female artist.  We see an initial misunderstanding (""I didn't want to jinx the sale"") become an ""empire.""  The scene where the Olivetti executive asks who painted the picture is telling - Margaret is frozen; even though she's holding another picture that's obviously by the same artist who painted the one on the wall, she cannot summon the courage to take credit for it.  Walter steps in, takes charge, and keeps going, eventually opening his own gallery, and coming up with the brilliant idea of selling cheap prints instead of original paintings.  The ""art poster"" is such an obvious consumer item, that it's hard to believe it didn't always exist, but someone - in this case, Walter Keane - had to come up with it first.  We eventually learn that he's a pathological liar, who didn't even paint the street scenes he originally passed off as his own, but he was telling the truth when he said he had the first ""factory"" and gave Andy Warhol his ideas.  Walter Keane was a marketing genius, if not an artistic one.  No one would have known about the ""big eyed kids"" without him.

Regardless of any edifying value her art had, we eventually see Margaret finally escape from the increasingly controlling and violent Walter, eventually humiliating him in a courtroom scene that, while predictable, is immensely satisfying in a facile way, like Margaret's art.  Walter dies penniless, still insisting that the ""big eyed kids"" were his work, despite never painting anything again.  We learn that Margaret is still alive, and still painting, although her attempt to copy Modigliani went nowhere, and if she's still painting those kids forty years later, no one seems interested anymore.  Still, it's nice that she, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stephen-Hawking/dp/B00QFSHCR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stephen Hawking</a>, was privileged to see the biopic of her own life.

While not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, ""Big Eyes"" is competently made, without the second act problems that can plague a plot-driven story, and is beautiful to look at, with saturated colors that almost pop off the screen.  For anyone who remembers these pictures or is remotely curious about them, ""Big Eyes"" brings to life a crazy yet believable story.",1429488000,,4331,6.097039473684211

It's as repetitive and plays one emotional note just like the big-eyed children paintings which I grew up with as a child. They were in our hallway. I found them fascinatingly eerie then and now. The reason they're questionable, as ""art,"" is because they don't allow the viewer to feel anything other than pity for a big eyed waif. One emotion, two if you count unsettling. The paintings arouse no further curiosity. They do not inspire. They have no history for the artist either, as stated in the film.

I have seen several of Tim Burtons more unusual movies and I wasn't sure what to expect with this particular true story but I was very pleasantly surprised.  He does an excellent job at conveying the story and letting it unfold as it naturally should.  Both Adams (as Margaret) and Waltz (as Walter) are great in the roles.  Waltz is especially good as the con-man salesman husband.  The story is well done and is entertaining throughout and from what I have read on the true story the movie sticks pretty closely to what happened even down to the court battle.

Those from the Keane art generation will relate to this movie but the story is interesting enough to keep those like me who aren't familiar with the story engaged in the movie and entertained throughout.

6927761,3,B00RD6DZL0,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot)com says : Big Eyes is not your typical Tim Burton film; thats good and bad. By crimeney he's earned the right to expand his directing vision.

The good, is the other-than-leads performances, the incredible sets, clothes and wonderful, based-on-true, story of the Keanes. A couple, who in the late 50s, brought the world those adorable (or disturbing) big eyed waifs: you know them. And, you probably grew up with them if you're over 40. Well kids, in them dark old days, Commies were everywhere, hamburger was 15 cents a pound (from cows that saw daylight), cars were huge, and a woman had no rights to speak of. Thats where the dreaded expression, barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen comes from. Women, believe it or not, were like accruements that made and cared for children while the men folk worked and provided. Shudder.

In the Keanes case, the woman painted unique odd children with huge descriptive eyes, and her man took all the credit. Thats not a spoiler, its the fact now known world-wide.

Why would a painter allow this fraud of their work? Thats what Burton explores.

This is where the bad comes in. he means well. It is just so hard to relate now. But, its a great story of eventually stepping up for ones self and breaking social taboos. I just wish it was even more toned down; go strictly drama. Love composer Danny Elfmanbut, in a couple of really un-dramatic scenes, of threats of abuse, the thundering score made it silly. It was not silly. But, with crescendo behind it, it played like a sketch show skit.

That being said, yes, see this. Show it to your daughters. Just do not expect a whimsical Tim Burton ditty. Its a Tim Burtonesque documentary of an amazing woman and her gregarious, slithering, husband that changed the way the world (really) gets their art.",1429401600,,1827,4.714733542319749

Big Eyes isn't your usual Tim Burton film. Though theres a twisted aspect to the relationship between painter Margaret Keane and her controlling husband Walteralong with a vibe thats faintly reminiscent of Edward Scissorhandsits still a pretty straightforward biopic. But don't be misled by the box blurb announcing that Amy Adams won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy. Big Eyes is neither. Its a drama made fascinating by Adams flawless performance, with occasional comedic moments provided by Christoph Waltzs brilliant-but-delusional P.T. Barnum-like antics as Walter Keane.

Walter manipulates the art world and the buying public as much as he does his wife, whose paintings he takes credit forfirst, to make a sale, then, because it feeds his ego. Throughout the Sixties they continue this charade, with Walter rising as a public figure and Margaret shrinking to even smaller dimensions than when they first met and she was overwhelmed by his personality.

You forget that its a Tim Burton film until Margaret goes grocery shopping and has hallucinations of all the other shoppers looking at her with the trademark big eyes that she featured on all of her paintings of children. Thats the one creepy moment in the film that feels Burtonesque. But you can see why the director was drawn to Margarets story. Like Edward Scissorhands, shes forced to live in isolation and spends much of her time in an attic, working away. Like Scissorhands, shes timid and naive and easily manipulated. And the big eyes she paints? Its those paintings of big-eyed, dark-eyed, sad-looking waifs that come closest to what we expect from Burton.

Big Eyes tells Margarets story, beginning with her flight in 1958 from her first husband and her meeting Walter Keane at a San Francisco art fair, where they both were trying to sell their works. Its rated PG-13 for thematic elements and brief strong language, but Id have to say that its pretty understated, with far less language and violence than most PG-13 movies, and no sex. It wouldnt hurt young teens to see that an abusive relationship doesnt have to involve physical violence. Theres no hitting in their marriage, only intimidation and manipulation, with Margaret being an unwitting enabler because of her timidity. Yes, theres one scene where Walter gets drunk and menaces his wife and stepdaughter, but young girls might benefit from seeing a film like this, and how easily things can snowball in a controlling relationship. While Big Eyes is the story of a twisted relationship, the focus remains on the art, the phenomenon that this kitsch art became, and what art and those children mean to Margaret. In that respect, its quirkier and more upbeat than your typical sour relationship story.

My 17-year-old son enjoyed it and said hed give it an A-, but my wife and I think that a bit generous. While the performances are great and the story is interesting, the film isn't as complex as it might have beenand maybe this is the Edward Scissorhands influence. Theres a fairly simple trajectory to the plot and an eventual resolution that feels very much like a fantasy fable with a moral to be learned. But that relative simplicity and the films fabulistic side also make Big Eyes more family-friendly than if Burton had opted for gritty realism and psychological complexity. But I don't think Big Eyes would interest children under 12.

Language:  One F-bomb and a handful of minor obscenities
Sex:  Nothing depicted or even implied, just one kissing scene
Violence:  An attempt to stab someone with a fork, a brief bar brawl, and drunken menace
Adult situations:  Drinking
Takeaways:  Art is in the eyes of the beholder, and no one should have to stay in a relationship that diminishes them

6927783,4,B00RD6DZL0,"We can herald this film because director Tim Burton has challenged himself by employing a conventional narrative to tell the story of Margaret (Amy Adams) and Walter (Christoph Waltz) Keane.  Theirs was a marriage of convenience in that Margaret needed a stable domestic situation to support her young daughter.  Because Walter was an inept artist he needed Margaret's artistic vision to compensate for his inadequacy.  As a woman in the Fifties Margaret wasn't taken seriously in the art community but Walter had the charisma and gumption to appropriate her works as his own.  Because her paintings sold like hotcakes Margaret was willing to hold her peace even as she simmered inside.  Walter on the other hand was wallowing in his newfound celebrity and as time elapsed began to believe  that he was the creative sparkplug behind Margaret's work.  ""Big Eyes"" recalls ""Ed Wood"", the last time Burton tackled an artist on the periphery of the American cultural scene.  In both cases the artists are savaged by the critics but have acolytes whose opinions resonate years later.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the artwork displayed here but one has to remember that Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol were sneered at by the cultural scions only to be revered by the general public.  ""Big Eyes"" isn't a great film but it is a very good one that kind of falters in the homestretch.  Adams is a model of consistency evolving from a timid housewife to a woman with intestinal fortitude in reclaiming what was taken from her by the end.  Waltz's performance is more problematic in that he succeeds in the early segments as a caddish manipulator but  later in the film chews the scenery in embarrassing fashion particularly in the courtroom scenes. As always Burton knows how to evoke time and place and Danny Elfman offers up a decent period jazz score. An ambitious film demonstrating that Burton is still on his game.",1429228800,2,1917,4.916149068322981

It moves along at a good pace, no boring moments. It reminded me of Quiz Show by Robert Redford in the dramatic documetarian style. A few enhancements here and there. He captures all the critical events in her life. The acting was very good, both of the main characters were well done. Each of them had personality transformations in the movie and they were convincing. Like some reviews mentioned, the husband was so extreme the character was almost unbelievable. But the historical account shows he was even more extreme than the movie portrayed (gagged during his trial, for example). What's a director to do? I think I give it 4.5 stars, just shy of 5. I guess I am never comfortable with the enhancements to a true story that are seen to be necessary to keep the audience involved.

6927809,5,B00RD6DZL0,"BIG EYES is a true story about a fraud.

Were all aware of those popular Walter Keane portraits of enigmatic waifs with overly large sad eyes, painted back in the 1960s and beyond.  Indeed, Keanes talent for self-promotion revolutionized the commercialization of popular art.

What we didn't know was that Walter Keane didn't paint those portraits.  Margaret Keane, his shy, introverted wife, painted them.

The secret was kept for years and, when the truth came out after the couple had split, it shocked the art world.

Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz play Margaret and Walter Keane in director Tim Burtons engrossing and pictorially gratifying film about this real life deception.  Both performers are at the top of their game and even though Waltz, at moments, appears to be a bit over the top in his portrayal of Walter Keane, in a Q&A supplement that appears on the Blu-ray disc, screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski assure us that the real Walter Keane was much more flamboyant than Waltzs interpretation.  In fact, the character in the screenplay was toned down.

Danny Huston, Krysten Ritter, Jason Schwartzman, Jon Polito and Terence Stamp co-star in this compelling story that would be difficult to believe if it wasn't true.

Aside from the Q&A highlights, the Blu-ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment contains a Making of featurette.  Incidentally, both the Q&A and the featurette include appearances by the real Margaret Keane.

Mr Burton directs the film with remarkable restraint, which adds to the story telling- he used similar understatement in the telling of the story of the notorious film maker Ed Wood.

Its the early 60s, and Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) is famous for his kitsch, sentimental paintings of big-eyed children. But its all a con  the paintings were actually created by his wife Margaret (Amy Adams), and shes had just about enough of living in his shadow.

What did I think?

Director Tim Burton dials down his trademark spooky-quirky to make a biopic, and theres not a Depp or Bonham Carter in sight. Adams finds the sweet spot between downtrodden and determined, and Waltz manages to be both the comic relief and a genuinely menacing presence.  Theres still enough Burton-ness to make the world seem just a little larger than life (and the gorgeous sets and costumes make the audience want to run away to the 60s) but it trails off into a made-for-TV ending.

The only problem is is that he passes them off as his own. Margaret goes along with it for a while but eventually hits a breaking point. The first thing I have to say is that if you are not a Tim Burton fan, don't let the fact that he directed this scare you off. This is nothing like his usual fare. That said, I have to say this is one of the better movies I have seen in the last few months. I really like true stories and this one was just bizarre and infuriating enough to make a good movie.

6927822,3,B00RD6DZL0,"Here is a new film from Tim Burton, creator of Edward Scissorhands, Alice in Wonderland and may others, but Big Eyes has no fantasy element in it. And no Johnny Depp, either. Instead of them, his new film features a based-on-truth story about a modern American artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), known for her paintings of big-eyed children, and her husband Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), who takes the credit for her works.

Big Eyes focuses the changing relationship between Margaret, who hides the secret even from her daughter, and Walter shrewd at marketing his works. The bio-pic also offers a few insightful observations about the modern art (Margaret Keanes works predate those of Andy Warhol, with whose comments the film starts).

The script of Big Eyes is written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, a screenwriting team that gave us another biographical movie about an artist Ed Wood (1994) directed by Tim Burton. The supporting players of Big Eyes include Danny Huston, Jon Polito, Krysten Ritter, Jason Schwartzman and Terence Stamp as sharp-tongued New York Times art critic John Canaday.

Despite the slick direction and good acting from the entire cast (and some nice soundtrack music), Burton misses every chance to make the film something different. Big Eyes is reasonably entertaining and thought-provoking, but it seems the film could have been much better, had some of the ideas presented in the film been explored more deeply, like critics vs. popular taste.",1424476800,5,1489,5.170124481327801
6927823,4,B00RD6DZL0,"Notably absent from Big Eyes are many of Tim Burtons distinguishing quirks. Devoid of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Burtons signature gothic style, Big Eyes is a refreshing feminist tale about the artist Margaret Keane. Though it never takes many risks and is pretty standard fare, its a light-hearted film with a brisk pace, and Adamss performance is especially noteworthy.

Big Eyes stars Amy Adams as Margaret Keane, and the film documents her marriage to her husband Walter, who takes credit for her work. This culminates in an intense legal battle, and the film is quite ambitious in this sense. Big Eyes is very personal, very personal. We delve into Keanes inner psyche. We see what made her tick and what these paintings mean to her. Margarets relationship with her daughter is an important part of the film, too, as we see the effects it has on her and the people around her.

While the film rushes a bit in the beginning, eventually it settles into a groove of confidence. Once Margaret meets Walter, things pick up steam. Their marriage is a very unique one, one that explores themes such as male dominance, female submissiveness, and artistic integrity.

Its all an interesting story, one definitely worth telling that hasn't been told before, and Burton handles it all well. His notable quirks are absent, but his form is still on point. The beautiful setting of San Francisco lends itself well and the 1950s details are alive and well. Art direction, costume design and cinematography are all spot-on. But where Burton gets the most out of the film is in Adams herself. One of my favorite actresses today, Adams is a gifted performer. As Keane, she is very well fleshed-out. A previous marriage has left her and her daughter fending for themselves, and her relationship with Walter tears her down. Her paintings are what gives her life, and Walter destroys that part of her.

On the flip side, Christoph Waltz gives a comical and silly performance as the villain Walter. Waltz is a good performer, but this kind of role just isn't for him. Every line he delivers with such strange intonation, and some of the things he does are just downright outlandish. Maybe this is the script, or maybe Waltz is just overacting to the point where Walter is just plain ridiculous. If the film was trying to subtly paint Walter as a one-dimensional villain, then they did the job, but I suspect there was more to Walter than what we see in the film.

Big Eyes is a return to form for Tim Burton. The man who brought us Big Fish and Ed Wood delivers a solid punch with Big Eyes. Its a little on the safe side, but its a great story with a pair of interesting characters that will keep you entertained in under two hours.",1423958400,2,2727,4.684759916492693

The two marry, and when Walter - a shameless promoter and salesman - tries to sell their work, it's only the big-eyed children people are interested in buying ... and soon Margaret learns he's taking credit for her paintings, ostensibly to get sales.  Based on their real-life story, for years Margaret would allow the deception as her husband gains international fame, and the film is an intriguing watch (Tim Burton doing a fine job directing).

6927826,4,B00RD6DZL0,"I have quite a few directors whose movies I admire such as Matthew Vaughn, Christopher Nolan, Peter Jackson, Josh Trank, Neil Blomkamp, and a few others. But filmmaker Tim Burton also is a favorite of mine; with movies like Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and the list goes on and on. One thing that is common in many of Burton's films is they are usually dark, or rather goth style movies. So I was admittedly surprised when I heard that he in fact directed Big Eyes.

Margaret is leaving her current town with her daughter, when she later arrives in San Francisco where she applies for a job at a furniture company. It just so happens that Margaret has a unusually gifted hand for painting so she is tasked with painting on the furniture. Margaret also sells her own paintings on the side, which is where she ends up meeting a mysterious man by the name of Walter. They quickly become attracted, and later married but little does Margaret know, Walter in fact has a hidden agenda.

Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz are appealing in their respective lead roles in Big Eyes. Amy Adams who portrays real life Margaret Keane is a feat to watch throughout the course of the movie. What is most impressive in her performance is how she portrays Margaret's love and dedication she has for her work; and the situation she is in during the movie which made me sympathize a great deal for her character. Christoph Waltz is quite quirky and extremely vocal in his role as Walter Keane. He does very well in being a smooth-talking, overeagerly persuasive person in his dealings, and Waltz is able to embody these traits really well. Terence Stamp stars in a supporting role as John Canaday and does a nice job, while actress Madeleine Arthur plays Jane the mysterious girl with the big blue eyes and does a nice job.

The story in this movie is able to keep your attention with the intriguing story of Margaret's paintings; while it also has some touching moments which I feel benefited Big Eye's overall theme. There are some funny moments, and the direction of Tim Burton guides this movie in the right way. It may not be a perfect movie nor is it the best Tim Burton movie, but Big Eyes is still

6927827,4,B00RD6DZL0,"Tim Burton has kind of lost it in recent years. He's had too much bad comic relief, too much pancake makeup, and too many roles where Johnny Depp mugs for the camera like a deranged lemur.

But ""Big Eyes"" may hint that he's gotten his creative spark back. This biographical movie about artist Margaret Keane is a much more subdued, character-driven piece -- while Burton's darker and/or over-the-top sensibilities occasionally surface, it's in a more subtle, believable way. And Amy Adams gives a sublime performance, completely vanishing into the persona of the trembly-voiced, anxious woman who paints big-eyed children to express her own torment.

After leaving her cheating husband, Margaret (Adams) and her daughter begin a new life for themselves. Her only real skill is painting, and her paintings catch the eye of the more outgoing, charismatic ""Sunday painter"" Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), who paints shallow, mediocre cityscapes. Eventually they marry, and Walter begins trying to sell their artwork to galleries and clubs. When people start noticing Margaret's paintings -- all of large-eyed, tragic-looking waifs -- Walter takes credit for them himself.

Margaret is understandably upset by this, but Walter convinces her to support the ruse -- first by claiming that her paintings wouldn't sell otherwise, and then by pointing out that they are engaging in fraud and she'll end up in jail. So Margaret is sent off to a locked room to paint every day, churning out more and more pictures of ""big eyes.""

Walter's business acumen turns Margaret's art into a small empire, lavishing the pictures on all the right people and churning out inexpensive prints. But Margaret's simmering resentment comes to a boil as she realizes that her increasingly abusive husband is not just a con man, but an artistic fraud as well. And after he drives her away, she is inspired to finally reveal the truth about her paintings -- only for Walter to fight her back in court.

""Big Eyes"" is probably the most ""conventional"" movie Burton has done in a long time, since most of it is handled in a smooth, elegant but fairly non-goth-kitschy style. There are many sunny windows full of light, smooth white buildings in California and colorful gardens filled with Hawaiian blooms, not to mention the palatial modern house of the Keanes. The darkest place in the whole movie is a nightclub, and at times it feels like Burton is holding back a little too much.

However, it's still recognizably Burton. For instance, one scene has Margaret wandering through a grocery store, having a bizarre hallucination where everyone around her has... BIG EYES. Big, spooky, zombie-like painted eyes. Yes, she finds this as terrifying as I do. In fact, the whole ""big eyes"" art style, with its dark eerie quality and huge eyes, seems like a natural focus for Burton's style, and it adds the note of gothic whimsy to the movie without being over-the-top about it.

But most of the darkness comes from the slow emotional imprisonment of Margaret. She is trapped in a soul-choking web of lies and finally abuse, which start out small and seemingly innocuous, but which accelerate little by little until she's being chased through the house by a grinning, drunken Walter, who tries to ignite the cans of turpentine in her studio. Yet oddly, Burton finds some grotesque humor in the story, mostly from Walter's increasingly delusional insistence that he's the artist -- the climactic courtroom scene is a masterpiece of uncomfortable weirdness, topped by the gloriously irritable judge.

Amy Adams gives one of the best performances of her entire career here -- she vanishes into the doe-eyed, platinum-haired Margaret as if she were putting on a diving suit. Here Margaret is a fragile, shy creature who keeps trying to do the right thing, and channels all the unhappiness she feels into her big-eyed children. Through subtle acting, she conveys the flickers of angry strength that Margaret is starting to feel, the angry bitterness, and finally the quiet triumph of an artist who has reclaimed her work before the world.

And yes, Burton does let us know (via the narrator's breezy sum-ups) that Margaret's life was made even harder because of the times she lived in, when men dominated women all the time and women were taught to just smile and put up with it. But thankfully, he doesn't belabor the point with straw men or ""wimmenz can do stuff too!"" speeches.

The other half of the equation is Christoph Waltz. He is absolutely terrifying here -- he has the charm and charisma to make an utterly plausible sociopathic liar, but from the beginning there are hints that he is bad news. There's a subtle shift in Waltz's acting over time, where his wide friendly smiles become more manic, toothy grins with wild empty eyes. And his wild imagination tipples right over into borderline nutbagginess when he turns the courtroom into a one-man show of filibustering, talking to himself, and constant celebrity name-dropping.

While Tim Burton is perhaps a little TOO restrained sometimes, ""Big Eyes"" is a delightful little movie with top-notch acting from both Waltz and Adams. It's unnerving, funny and -- for Burton -- quite subtle.",1422230400,,5204,5.011574074074074

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Back in the 60s when I was a little over ten years old, I remember the posters of the children with the big eyes were everywhere. There was something about them, even as a child, that caught my eye. They were a little creepy, but you couldn't stop looking at them. Art critics had a field day with them, dismissing them as ""kitsch"" and certainly not ""art."" But the master of kitsch, Andy Warhol, insisted they ""had to be good,"" as he reasoned if they were bad, so many people wouldn't like them.

Rodrigo Perez writing in ""The Playlist"", argues that director Tim Burton's work, ""with its usually playfully macabre style and tone, can be spotted a mile away."" His ""work is often aesthetically sumptuous but otherwise either emotionally slight or just vacant."" Perez maintains that ""Big Eyes"" is a ""hyper-stylized cartoon, treated like another frothy trifle of a story more interested in garish period style than anything resembling genuine human emotion."" The problem with Perez's argument is that the real story of Margaret and Walter Keane WAS like a ""hyper-stylized cartoon,"" and a ""frothy trifle"" at best. However, it was also grimly fascinating, just like the grimly fascinating paintings Margaret Keane churned out year after year.

On the surface, it would appear that adapting the Keane story to the screen, would be a difficult one. The problem is that Margaret's real-life story doesn't go anywhere. She ends up marrying Walter Keane because she's at a vulnerable point in her life with a young child to raise and reasons that getting hitched will bring her some measure of security. When Keane begins claiming that he is the painter responsible for Margaret's ""Big Eyes"" portraits, she decides to keep quiet, trusting her husband's reasoning that the public would be more accepting of the paintings if they believed they were done by a man.

Indeed, the most repetitious parts of the film involve Walter badgering Margaret to keep quiet about the paintings' true authorship as well keeping that secret from Jane, Margaret's daughter. The screenwriters draw you in, however, by focusing on how Walter becomes filthy rich marketing Margaret's paintings. Initially, he gets good publicity by ""donating"" paintings to various international notables (including a representative at the Soviet Consulate). Later, in response to some savage criticism from the art critic at the NY Times, he goes on television and makes up a story about how he encountered orphans after World War II in Europe, who were the inspiration for the paintings. And then there's Walter's brilliant idea to mass market the paintings as cheap posters!

While Walter's machinations are quite absorbing, the screenwriters can find little for Amy Adams to do playing Margaret. At one point, she confesses to a priest about her plight, and he advises that she listen to ""the man of the house."" Later, there's a rather lame fantasy sequence where Margaret imagines shoppers in Walmart with big eyes! The narrative continues to slow down when Margaret has a rather dull discussion with an attendee at Walter's gallery exhibition, concerning one of her (non-Big Eyes) paintings, exhibited under her name. There's also little tension in a scene where one of Margaret's old friends visits her at the Keane's newly purchased expensive home in the suburbs. That visit goes badly as Keane becomes upset with the friend, suspecting that she may be on to uncovering his scam.

The second act crisis livens things up again. Margaret discovers Walter's old ""paintings,"" were probably not done by him at all (underneath the Keane signature, there's another name). This is the last straw for Magaret and they're soon sleeping in separate beds. Walter begins to spiral downward, confronting the Times critic at a cocktail party and eventually setting Margaret's studio on fire.

After Margaret and her daughter move to Hawaii, we find out that in order to get a divorce, she must paint and deliver 100 more paintings for Walter. The film concludes with the famed defamation trial where Walter decides to be his own attorney. I'm told most of it happened as it was depicted in the film--Walter questions himself on the stand and later the judge forces Walter and Margaret to paint a ""Big Eyes"" sample painting, before the jury.

While the film ably points out that Margaret ultimately won her defamation suit against Walter, what they don't tell you is that an appeals court overturned a $4 million dollar judgment against Walter. Nonetheless, he eventually died penniless in 2000.

In a limited part, Amy Adams ably conveys the emotional exasperation Margaret experienced. Christoph Waltz hams it up as usual, as the empty vessel Walter. Tim Burton has once again created a sumptuous visual palate with a low-stakes story that nonetheless proves grimly fascinating at times.",1421971200,5,4896,5.055762081784387
6927830,5,B00RD6DZL0,"Set in the 1950's California, the production values are stunning. Not a fan of Tim Burton's prior movies, this is a pleasant departure from his strange offerings. The story is very compelling, describing Margaret Keane's journey to take charge of her life and artistry.

All the actors are great, but Amy Adams is just completely mesmerizing, simply becoming Margaret Keane. Chris Waltz reminds me of Dick Van Dyke, maybe a little over the top, but perfectly believable as Margaret's husband playing a blowhard 'used car salesman' type of person. With no violence and some humor, this movie is a breath of fresh air, realistic and enjoyable from start to finish.",1421798400,53,662,5.0181818181818185
6927831,4,B00RD6DZL0,"I really enjoyed this movie based on the allegedly true story of Margaret Keane.  I say ""allegedly"" because I note that the daughter of Walter Keane (or at least she claims) reviewed this movie, gave it one star, and says that the movie is not really accurate as it portrays her father.  That having been said, the movie was really interesting and I enjoyed watching Amy Adams portray Margaret Keane.  In the 1960s, women in this country still held a substantially lesser place than men, and to sell her paintings, Walter Keane pretended to be the true artist behind Margaret's art, paintings of children with oversized doe eyes.  The art became very popular, and Walter became a success (for pretending to be the artist behind Margaret's work). In 1964 Margaret left him and divorced him in 1965.  In 1970 she publicly announced that she was the true artist.  If you enjoy true stories of a biographical nature, this was very interesting. After watching, I googled the real Margaret and Walter Keane, and read more about their lives. When I do that, I always know that the movie was worth watching. It makes you think and holds your interest.  Overall, well done and recommended.",1421625600,5,1180,4.783251231527093
6927832,4,B00RD6DZL0,"Tim Burton's ""Big Eyes"" is his best film in years. It tells the true-life story of Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), a San Francisco housewife and painter circa 1960 who is dragooned by her husband (Christoph Waltz) into painting fanciful portraits of big-eyed waifs that he can pass off as his own. The film has a great deal to say about the rampant sexism of the period (when Margaret goes to a priest for help, he tells her to submit to her husband in all things), and it is deeply satisfying when Margaret, in a forthright yet delicately nuanced performance by Adams, manages to claim her rightful place.

Some critics accused Waltz of going way over the top in his performance as Walter Keane. Personally, I thought he was great, reminding me both of Joseph Schildkraut in ""The Shop Around the Corner"" and John Cleese in ""Fawlty Towers."" Another high point of ""Big Eyes"" is the rich, varied cinematography of Bruno Delbonnel, recalling the glory days of Technicolor. ""Big Eyes"" may lack the final touch of urgency that would make it a great film, but it is still a highly enjoyable one--funny, harrowing, and satisfying.",1421366400,3,1119,4.768041237113402
