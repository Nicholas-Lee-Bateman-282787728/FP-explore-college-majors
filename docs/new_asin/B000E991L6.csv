8216584,3,B000E991L6,"On December 9, 1965, something came down in the woods outside Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.  Multiple witnesses saw the object in flight, and a number of locals made their way to the crash site before the military swooped in and took over.  Officially, nothing was found, and Kecksburg is a non-story; unofficially, the Kecksburg crash is probably the second most compelling case (after Roswell) for a UFO crash in American history.  There is ample evidence that the military removed an acorn-shaped object matching witness descriptions of the crashed craft and transported it to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

Kecksburg UFO Crash: What Really Happened at Kecksburg? relates the basic story of the crash and the seeming military cover-up, as told by remaining witnesses and UFO experts, and examines several possible explanations of the event.  It breaks no new ground and, as such, offers very little to those already familiar with the story.  It ignores important elements of the after-story, such as the mysterious death of newsman John Murphy, and refers early on to alien bodies without ever following up on this important claim.  I've yet to see a Kecksburg documentary that truly does the story justice, but I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kecksburg-The-Untold-Story/dp/B00014NEGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kecksburg - The Untold Story</a>&nbsp;to this particular documentary.",1349740800,,1443,5.942028985507246

MY REVIEW:
THIS IS A STORY THAT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED WITH. THIS IS A STORY THAT I BELIEVE 100%. THIS DOCUMENTRY IS NOT THE GREATEST DONE ON THE SUBJECT BUT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND WELL WORTH THE 8 BUCKS TO BUY IT. I BOUGHT THIS KNOWING THAT I WOULD NOT BE LET DOWN BECAUSE THIS SUBJECT OF A UFO CRASH HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON MY MIND BECAUSE OF THE FEEL OF REALITY BASED UPON IT.
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT COVERUP ALL THE WAY AND THIS STORY NEVER FADES BECAUSE IT IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF HOW FAR OR GOVERNMENT IS WILLING TO GO TO HIDE IT'S SECRETS. THIS SHOWS HOW THE MILITARY WARNED AND TOLD THOSE THAT WITNESSED THE ORDEAL TO SHUT UP OR BE SHUT UP.
TO ME THERE IS MORE REALITY AND TESTIMONY AND SUBJECT MATTER ON THIS CASE THEN ON ROSWELL EVEN THOU BOTH ARE TRUE THIS ONE TO ME STANDS OUT MORE FOR THE MASSIVE WITNESSES AND STORIES AND HOW SOMETHING DID HAPPEN THERE.
THIS IS WORTH THE 8 BUCKS TO SPEND ON IT, A GOOD HOUR LONG DOCUMENTARY THAT TAKES YOU INTO A STORY OF TRUTH THAT IS HIDDEN FROM US.",1196121600,3,1029,4.099009900990099
8216587,1,B000E991L6,"I've seen several other documentaries regarding the crash at Kecksburg (Unsolved Mysteries and the version by the History Channel), which stated the facts; reporting the activity surrounding this incident.  And those were great productions.  That said, this DVD, ""Secrets of UFOs: Kecksburg UFO Crash"" is absolutely horrible.

This DVD was obviously produced on a very low budget; this is evident through poor quality of the re-enactment scenes and the bad acting.  Nonetheless,  I can live with a low budget production, provided that they have their facts strait, and are presenting them in a way that would let a viewed make up their own mind.

This DVD offers no new facts, but what is worse is that it tries to imply many things that are not factual.  Productions like this DVD detract from legitimate UFO documentaries.

Don't waste your money or time with this DVD... even at $7, it's a waste of money.",1166659200,4,908,4.927631578947368
