7696486,5,B01D3RPL0U,"Andi (Rita Artmann) is a singer in the punk rock band ""Titanium Turdles"" and not a very good one at that. When aliens attack Australia and only Australia, she believes it is because of her due to a close encounter she had 17 years ago, that gave her ""telepathetic"" [sic] powers. She leads an attack of family and friends against them that includes her nerd  puffer brother Elliot (Doug Hatch), fighter Keith ""cheap shot"" Flynn (Lawrence Silver), Cam (Tamara McLaughlin) who operates a camera...and not too well, and John (Joe Bauer) who dies a lot.

This is a quirky camp-fest film that was funny from beginning to end. The film pays homage to ""Close Encounters"", ""Poltergeist"", ""E.T."", ""The Fugitive"" , ""Star Child""  and spoofs alien films in general. There are running jokes throughout the film which doesn't look highly on Tasmania.

Guide: No sex or nudity. Seems like Andi says something that sounds like the F-word 3 times in her ""telepathetic"" mode.",1475107200,,956,4.882716049382716

7696508,4,B01D3RPL0U,"Okay! Hear me out. Right off the bat, this movie is obviously not your next Oscar winner, it's not an intellectual masterpiece that will having an existential crisis in the middle of the night questioning if everything in life is even real or if you are even you. This movie is the perfect movie for when you've got nothing to do, no responsibilities to attend, and you're just looking for some turn-off-your-brain fun. Seriously, I wanted to watch this movie ever since the title caught my eye. The movie itself had a limited budget, the CGI is (I'm so sorry) a little laughable, and the acting is what you'd expect from a parody film.

I would definitely re-watch and recommend.",1472860800,,761,4.637037037037037

7696514,5,B01D3RPL0U,"Seems to be strongly hit-or-miss with reviews, but at least for those with a penchant for the quirky, there are some genuine laughs to be had here. For me, it was somewhat reminiscent of Kung Fury in both pacing and style, and with the 80s theme replaced by an Australian one. The special effects were somewhat reminiscent of a B-Movie version of Mars Attacks.

We both enjoyed it all the way through to the end, and just describing the movie to friends later we all ended up laughing ourselves silly. Granted, it's a low-budget, cross-eyed goofy horror movie, but if you enjoy that kind of thing, this is light-years better than Sharknado.

This is a low budget film, they probably spent more on the CGI than the rest of the movie. There was one thing I couldn't figure out, in some scenes the two lead actresses had cleavage and then the next time we see them in the same scene they didn't, kind of a weird thing to notice. And I could swear that I have seen Cam (Tamara MacLaughlin) in a number of movies, perhaps it wqas just her character that looked familiar.

7696543,5,B01D3RPL0U,"Unbelievably relentless in its ability to drag ones attention from absurdity to inanity to insanity to nutzoid and then start all over again at least 50 times in this film.  It's not like, it's not similar to, it's exactly one long ""I don't believe they jumped the same shark again"" moment.  And yet these characters are so richly sussed that despite all of them deserving heavy sedation and shackles for the safety of the general public, they sweep the viewer involuntarily along the length of the film with diversions so amateurish, slapstick so rubber-chickeny, special effects so late 50s, jokes so over told you see them coming the first time they were told, and a most worthy script that blends these ""creatures"" into a philosophic study on all-things-Australian, but not really, that's deeper than any film in which Tom Cruise ever starred.  I kid. i kid.  Anyway -- you should experience this every-kind-of-9th-grade-stupid-in-a-heap capture you.

It bears a 2nd viewing even.  Maybe.  If I do watch it again, I hope I give it enough time to have gotten out of ""recent memory.""  Say, several months at least, and then it could be 90% of tonight's delights, because this thing's jammed packed with details -- like the necessity of coconut sprinkles to trigger the healing power of ""spreadable goodness"" for gaping, raw, puked-on, bite wounds.

And by almost every film-critic metric -- this thing's not even a C flick, but this whole crew probably could care less about the viewers' takes on it, and it's that that gives this film its innocence -- they're not embarrassed to be doing the roles, because everyone was carrying a lot of the film and delivered -- the thing drips with sincerity and honesty about what's afoot.

It's this:  if this film was a school play, it would be talked about until every person involved or who had been in the audience was long gone.  That's the value of this -- it convinces you to forgive all its fakery, because that's exactly what you'd do for your own family if they had, indeed, pulled off this production's 30,000 details.  It's just amazing how much ""product"" they shamelessly offered.  Like children trying to pay for something with Monopoly money.  It endears.

2nd viewing was wonderful.  My review above stands.

That being said, the movie is actually really enjoyable. The people who made it understand that they weren't making a blockbuster and poked fun at themselves and that is where the beauty lies. I wholeheartedly believe that if you watch this movie by yourself then you are doing yourself a disservice.

7696563,5,B01D3RPL0U,"If you go into this one knowing it's a low budget movie that didn't waste money on expensive realistic looking CGI and other special effects, and hasn't paid big money to have any big name (or even known) actors in it and the acting is pretty bad (or maybe really good and intentionally supposed to have the overacting feel to it), then I think you'll enjoy this one.  Basically Aliens have invaded Australia and are attacking all the state capital cities.  We follow the invasion in Brisbane with a group of Queenslanders in their late 20's.  Most are in a band which has never made it, another is a wannabe documentary maker who is annoyed she has to keep filming terrible bands to pay the bills, and the other is the socially awkward stereotypical glasses wearing, overweight, allergic to everything guy, who is the brother of Andi the singer of the band. Andi is the alpha member of the friend group and always believed in Aliens and even saw one over the driveway of her house when she was 10 years old, seventeen years before.  Andi believes the aliens are attacking because of what happened when she was 10 and that they gave her powers such as being able to control them through her mind.  No one else believes her.  When she gets a text that aliens have kidnapped her mother she is determined to get home to find out what happened.

As I said the acting isn't great, especially in the seventeen years ago scenes with the kids where the mother actually has the worst acting performance of the lot.  But it is fun.  You don't need to know much about Australia to get the jokes, although to really enjoy the bicyclist scene when the UFO's are pursuing them (called a bikeist by our not that bright male lead), you've got to be aware of the frustration on our roads as ridiculous laws for bike safety result in cars not being able to overtake a rider deliberately hogging the middle of a whole car lane and not moving over.  This film actually reminded me more of British TV humour than Australian.  If you like the IT Crowd for example, it's that sort of thing.

Although a lot of the time the aliens attempting to pass as humans are just green coloured people, when we do see them in their natural form, they do look quite good. The weapons look like toys, and the UFOs like like something from a 90's computer game.  Australiens is a movie that is never taking itself seriously, the actors were obviously having a lot of fun.  The credits list Griffith University so these are probably a bunch of university graduates from ten/fifteen years ago who have gone their separate ways, worked in the TV/Film industry for the past ten fifteen years, and decided to get together and make a full length film.  The extras include some preview's, one of which mentions from the people who brought you two other titles, which it then admits, that you've probably never heard of.  There's Q & A which is also very amateurishly filmed where one guy pretty much admits he did a large number of jobs usually shared amongst a variety of crew people.

Just as something fun to notice here on Amazon, when you search for this film, how amazing it is that there are so many products that have been manufactured where people actually think the word Australians is spelt like the title of this film.",1469750400,,3285,4.531302876480542

7696568,5,B01D3RPL0U,"This is a funny medium-budget Indie comedy that I thoroughly enjoyed watching.  This movie is about a group of struggling middle-class Brisbane rock-band losers who take on invading space aliens who for some unknown reason are attacking only Australia. And for some strange reason Tasmania seems immune as well.  Think of it as a light-hearted Australian version of Shaun of the Dead, but without the zombies or comic genius of Simon Pegg.  It has a lot of Jr. High comedy with a lot of Uranus and Vegemite jokes, but it has its truly witty moments too.  It is very fun movie to watch with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.  The special effects are quite good, as is the acting - with the actors having a lot of fun with their characters. The first encounter with a live alien is hilarious, as is the alien interrogation scene.

Keep in mind that this is an alien invasion movie, so there are some mildly icky parts with the occasional exploding alien guts splattering our heroes - but it's in good fun and I think this movie would be fine for pre-teens.  This is slumber-party gold guaranteed to bring out plenty of shrieks and yucks, And even the adults will enjoy it.

I honestly cannot understand the people who panned this movie - it's hilarious fun.",1469577600,,1255,4.647058823529412

7696573,3,B01D3RPL0U,"2 1/2 stars for effort. Not that great a movie but i did discover some interesting things about the Aussies in the process so it wasn't a total waste. Sociology students take note!

I learned that Australians have a huge inferiority complex when it comes to the USA and the Western Northern Hemisphere in general. Their first method of attempted compensation is of course to cut the big guys down to size via insults, stereotypes and humor. Kind of like the way people love to hate certain sports dynasties or to look down upon really rich people. The second, and more pathetic, way of dealing with their lack of national self esteem is akin to what often happens to a person who is bullied. So just like a child who is picked on at home or school they in turn may find someone else- a weaker someone else- to belittle, mock and control. The child now has an arena in which he feels powerful, superior and self important. Think ""middle child syndrome."" And poor Tasmania, apparently, has the youngest sibling role and gets  the brunt of middle child Australia's pent up angst and frustration... a double dose of all the perceived abuses and injustices they receive from a big brother half a world away

LOL, ok so I don't really take it all that seriously but these thoughts were my honest, first, gut reactions to the flick. At least I was finding more logic in this psychological analysis than I was in the plot and writing! So if you like fairly bad, B grade sci fi then there will probably be some moments that you will enjoy.

Please don't question the harshness of this review, thinking that perhaps it should have been kinder as this movie was intended as fluff, parody or satire. ""The Last Starfighter"" was fluff and pretty good fluff, at that. ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Galaxy Quest"" and even ""Spaceballs"" were pretty good parody. ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" is wonderful satire. ""Australiens"" is none of those. If you want to credit it with being ""campy,"" think again. ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" is campy.

As a screenplay writer for Vimeo/Youtube director Frank Stamm, Im judging this film by the same standards Id grade a low-budget project I was involved in.

Australiens is very professionally produced, feeling a lot like a Saturday morning TV dramedy for kids  the show Eerie Indiana comes to mind. The acting in Australians is a little exaggerated, but absolutely appropriate for Saturday morning TV. Lighting, sound, cinematography, etc. are all handled well. The occasional joke about being drunk, or joke about sex organs, keeps this from being something you could recommend to kids.

The show either rises or falls depending on your level of enjoyment watching what is essentially TV written to a young audiences sensibilities... with the occasional swear.",1484784000,,771,5.295081967213115
