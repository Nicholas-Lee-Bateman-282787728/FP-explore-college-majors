Both Mana Ashida and Fuku Suzuki (the orphaned Twins) were superb and so was Abe Sadao (Foster Father)  they argued, laughed together, worked together = everything a Real Family would do.  And, of course, don't forget Mook the Talking Dog.  The Supporting Cast was also outstanding.  Whatever your age is, this is a show not to be missed.",1418083200,,366,4.838709677419355
8473627,5,B005HTQ9E0,"It was my first experience with Japanese movies. And I was much pleased. Very warm, sometimes funny movie having a good morale underground. Maybe without fantastic speaking dog it would look more realistic, but anyway even in the presented variant it is very nice and cute.

P.S. Product placement detected ;-))))))",1390435200,,315,5.176470588235294
