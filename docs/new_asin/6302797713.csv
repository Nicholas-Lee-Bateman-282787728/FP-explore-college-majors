520351,5,6302797713,This is a movie for all fathers and sons to watch together...Living our lives for others and with others takes special care and nuturing... I named my son after Brian...

520352,4,6302797713,"Brian's Song is one of the saddest movies ever made, based on the too-true story of the black/white friendship between Gale Sayer and Brian Piccolo. James Caan does a credible, if self-absorbed job as Brian -- his sickly  scenes definitely do not hold up as well as you might remember, and though  this movie definitely looks and sounds dated, it still packs a powerful  emotional punch, in the same way that Terms of Endearment does.  Beware:  you are headed for very rough waters.  And that Michel Legrand theme song,  a classic for the ages, turns the nozzle to full-tilt.  That final still  image remains firmly etched in my mind, and the special relationship  engendered here carries a special weight as one of the first of its kind  ever seen in a film.",946252800,31,759,4.674242424242424
520353,5,6302797713,"I watched this show when I was 13, I am now 39 and remember it still. It was so moving it made me shed a tear. It also taught me to never give up. It taught me what friendship was, in spite fo race, creed, or politics.  Watch this movie. If you know of a football fan, this movie is sure to  touch their heart!",913593600,7,310,3.753846153846154

520444,5,6302797713,"When you haven't seen a movie in 40+ years, and you can remember lines, scenes and bits from it like you just saw it last week -- that's a special movie.

This was a TV movie of the week, and it had an outstanding cast. James Caan was not yet famous as Sonny. Billy Dee Williams was a decade away from being Lando. The supporting cast was excellent. The story was amusing, focusing on Brian Piccolo's humor and Gale Sayers' immense talent, and his humanity.

And, oh yeah, this is a tear-jerker. If you're not hiding some watery eyes from the rest of the room at the end, you're not human. In every way, this has the quality of a well-made feature film.

Highly recommended",1485475200,,673,4.368

Truly a beautiful - but tragic - movie.  I cried at 17 and again at 60, but I laughed a lot, too.  I immediately went online and bought a copy of the book for two young football player friends of mine, one whose mother can't get him to read.  Perhaps this will help - how could it not?

520529,5,6302797713,"Brian's Song is a made for television movie made for ABC in 1971,  that features James Caan and Billy D. Williams. This sports movie is based on the book, ""I Am Third"", the autobiography written by Gayle Sayres. The story deals with the friendship of future hall of fame running back, Gayle Sayres and his roommate, Brian Piccolo and how they cope with Brian's terminal  illness. The movie was such a success for ABC, ABC released the movie to theaters where the movie did no business.
Adapted by veteran screenwriter, William Blinn, A Dallas newspaper critic said that Blinn's screenplay was highly restrained and avoided overt sentimentalityyet conveyed the true friendshio that the men had for each other. In a 2005 Entertainment weekly survey, ""Brian's Song"" was listed as the 7th best ""guy cry"" movie ever made.
Note: The movie was remade by Disney in 2001. The remake is not worth watching.

520638,5,6302797713,"This no ordinary sports movie.

It's based on the true story of football player Brian Piccolo but it's not really all about men bouncing their bodies around the gridiron. It's about friendship that endures, great courage and unbreakable spirit. And it's about skin color not being a factor in deciding whether you like the guy sitting beside you in the locker room.

The football side of it is, excuse the pun, secondary.

(Incidentally, this is the original 1971 movie, not the more recent remake, and this is by far the superior version.)

James Caan plays Piccolo, the would-be pro star who has little going for him physically -- not great size or huge power, and definitely not blinding speed. But what he does have is a heart so big you wonder how it could fit inside a stadium, let alone his chest.

When Piccolo joins the Chicago Bears he meets a fellow rookie, a guy who possesses all the physical assets he lacks, and then some. That rookie is Gale Sayers (played by the young Billy Dee Williams). They're rivals, both chasing a slot as a running back. Two football players with apparently little in common, one black, one white, one struggling to make it, one so gifted he eventually is ranked as one of the greats. But despite their differences and despite their rivalry, they like each other immensely and form a tight friendship.

Piccolo has a seemingly impossible task in seeking to cement a Bears playing spot but won't stop trying to make the climb, no matter how steep the mountains that keep getting dumped in his path.

But suddenly he faces a far tougher battle than going head to head with more naturally gifted athletes. What follows is an inspiring and deeply moving story about a man of incredible will who possesses an amazingly dauntless spirit.

It's a movie few will forget. Be warned, your eyes probably won't be dry at the end.

Caan, a young actor when he took the role, has never been better. His is a magical performance. Williams is also outstanding as Sayers and, no surprise, Jack Warden does a fine job as the hard-bitten football coach.",1435795200,,2075,4.678571428571429

520653,5,6302797713,"This is undoubtedly one of the best made-for-TV motion pictures of all time.  The remake is nowhere near as good as the original, which holds up very well after all these years.  My main criticism is that in an effort at political correctness, some of the dialog is bleeped when the film is shown on television today.  It was considered all right in 1971, but apparently 40+ years later we can't be exposed to such words.  I refer to the scene in which Piccolo tries to make Sayers angry when he is trying to get him to rehab his surgically-repaired knee, and the scene in which he tells Sayers his wife is pregnant and, if it's a boy, he'd like to name him after Sayers, jokingly using a derogatory racial term instead of ""Gale.""  The problem is that these bleeped words are very important to the compelling story line about a white player from the south becoming a roomate and good friend of a black player, discovering some important truths about his bigotry along the way.  It reminds me of the bleeping of several of Jack Nicholson's lines in ""A Few Good Men"" when it is aired on TV; the bleeping keeps us from truly finding out what a miserable SOB Col. Jessup really is.  Such editing really interferes with the power of the story.  Unedited, five stars, emphatically!",1432512000,,1275,4.537117903930131

Brian's Song (1971) stars Billy Dee Williams and James Caan.  It's basically about a friendship between football teammates Gale Sayers and Brian Piccolo.  Sayers gets injured, Piccolo gets sick.  They're roommates.  They both support each other while they are going through their respective traumas.  That's all I want to say.  Watch the movie to see how everything unfolds.  The acting is pretty good.  A young Billy Dee Williams is quite believable as Gale Sayers.  Actual footage of Sayers in action on the gridiron is used throughout the movie mixed in with footage of Billy Dee Williams in his role as Sayers.

This is a made-for-TV movie, remember.

Well, now I understand a little better.  It's a football movie and that's probably what gave it so much appeal to my classmates; the LOVED football whereas I still know very little about the game (what exactly is a punt??)

Still, as a ""made for tv"" film it is pretty good.  James Caan and billy Dee Williams are excellent.  It was a tiny but corny here and there but I am glad (40+ years later) that I was finally able to see it.  Thanks amazon.com prime!!",1380931200,,731,4.215827338129497

520818,5,6302797713,"Brian's Song (1971) is a made-for-TV movie that tugs at ones heart strings and carries a message of love, friendship, and above all, courage. The movie centers around the quiet and reserved superstar running back Gale Sayers and his good and selfless outgoing friend Brian Piccolo, who is used to being in the wrong place at the wrong time in terms of getting noticed. When Sayers suffers a terrible knee injury, it is Piccolo who wants Sayers to heal and resume his great career because Piccolo doesn't want to be someone who gains the #1 string the easy way. Piccolo inspires Sayers to work hard to rehabilitate his knee, which he does. Meanwhile, Piccolo's performance on the field noticeably falters, and it turns out that he has cancer. Now Sayers is the one who is the rock and support that the other needs, and is by Piccolo's side throughout his illness. This film came out at a time when race was a huge social issue, yet it shows how Sayers and Piccolo had no issues whatsoever when it came to race relations. Their time as roommates caused a stir that would never occur today. In the end, this movie ultimately puts life and its trials and tribulations into proper perspective.

520850,4,6302797713,"I recently screened the original BRIAN'S SONG for a film series on ""Friendship In Film.""  It's not easy to find American films that explore that theme on a deeper level than the typical buddy-buddy flick.  There are any number of films out there about deep and  lasting friendships between women, but male friendship has been significantly less attention paid to it--understandable given the still strong cultural taboos against men expressing emotions and the implicit fear that too strong an emotional bond between men might imply at least latent homosexuality.

This 1971 made-for-TV movie can be seen as something of a cultural watershed, in a way.  I actually missed the original broadcast back in the day (I was away at college and had other concerns), but I do recall that it was something of a media event. And understandably so.  When the cinematic Gale Sayers, receiving an award for ""Most Courageous Athlete,"" announces that his gallant teammate and friend, the mortally ill Brian Piccolo is infinitely more deserving of that award and that he (Sayers) will present it to him personally the next day,  well, there's not a dry eye in the auditorium--or, for that matter, in any of the millions of living rooms where the film is being viewed.  And when he expresses his love for his dying friend, well, no one's going to misinterpret that statement.

Is it easier to express such sentiments about someone who's dead or dying?  Probably.  BRIAN'S SONG actually is kind of predictably buddy-buddy for the first hour or so.  Like many male friends, these guys express their affection for each other by bantering back and forth and playing silly practical jokes.  Viewers understand from the get go, of course, that a deeper bond is being forged, one that transcends race, or the fact of their sports rivalry, or of their decidedly different personalities.

But it does take personal tragedy for that affection to be articulated.  Some might find that something of a shame.  Others will just say that's just the way things are (or WERE back in those storied days of those  yore).  BRIAN'S SONG, like most bio-flicks--and ESPECIALLY like most bioflicks on TV--is often frustratingly sketchy.  But it does make plain an implicit truth found in many close friendships between men.  The bonds are not just superficial--even when the banter mainly is.

I recently did a solo performance of the old Louis Armstrong song ""Wonderful World"" in my church, and was struck anew by the lyrics, ""I see friends shaking hands, saying, 'How do you do?'/They're really saying, 'I love you.'""  In the case of Brian Piccolo, when he learns that his good friend has donated a pint of blood to him, what comes out of his mouth is, ""Well, no wonder I woke up with a craving for chitlins.""  But we know he's really sayin'  ""I love you.""

And ""THANK YOU!""",1227312000,,2835,4.8684759916492695
520851,5,6302797713,I remember it was shortly after my divorce and I was laying on the sofa fliping through the channels and happened on Brian's Song. I'm 61 years old and to this day I have never been so moved by any film. I remember many films over the years where I teared up and had trouble talking but I've never had a movie hit me as Brian's Song did when I was laying on that sofa. I was glad I didn't have anyone else around because I cried like a baby and couldn't stop for some time. The story is about true friendship not something that's manufactured it's real and honest and something we all wish we had which is a friend that you can count on no matter what.

Warden seems totally miscast as Bears coach Geoge Halas and a cameo of Abe Gibron doesn't help, but otherwise the film runs smoothly.

It's hard to believe it was only 40 years ago and many teams still had not broken the racial barriers off the field. I remember watching it on TV when it first aired and it was as good or better the 2nd time. Their friendship transcended their racial difference and their competition for the same position into a genuine love and respect for each other. As Gale experiences a potential career ending injury and Brian is diagnosed with cancer, their friendship grows into something very special. The selflessness of Brian helping Gale to recover from his injury which will ultimately put him back on the bench after replacing Gale is an inspiration.

520876,5,6302797713,"I have watched Brian's Song many, many times over the years and with every viewing, I am warmed by this story of friendship, courage and hope.  It is based on the true story of Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers, two Chicago Bears football players who played back in the 1960's.

Like many movies based on life, certain aspects of the story are fictionalized. For example, Brian did not have cancer in his right lung as the movie attests, but embryonal cell carcinoma in his chest cavity that eventually metastasized to his left breast and left lung, heart and liver--and even into his jaw.  He did not die as easily or look nearly as healthy as Cann does; his illness and death are really sanitized and ""Hollywood-ized"".  Also, although Brian and Gale were good friends in real life, they were not best friends. However, Caan and Williams do a brilliant job portraying their characters and it is easy to believe from their performances that these two characters do indeed care for one another.

There are several moving moments in this movie. The locker room scene is particularly touching because many of the players featured in this scene had heard the *real* Gale Sayers tell them that ""Pic is sick. . .real sick"" only a year and a half before, so we can  assume the tears welling up in the players' eyes are genuine.  Ed O'Bradovich and Dick Butkus, both of whom were friends of Piccolo's (and were pallbearers at his funeral), make appearances in the film.

Another great touch is the archival footage of Sayers and Piccolo running the ball and making touchdowns.  Not only does the footage remind us of what an amazing player Sayers was and the dogged determination to succeed that Brian possessed, it reminds us that these people were real, that they did indeed exist.  These ""real life"" touches adds a lot of poignancy to the story.  Most of the footage of the real Brian comes from a game the Bears played against the Pittsburgh Steelers on November 9, 1969--the only game the Bears won that season.  Although he did not know it, Brian was already very sick with cancer during this game, yet he played his heart out and even scored a touchdown--which is captured in the movie.  This was the second to the last game he ever played.  He was diagnosed with cancer only a week and a half later.

A final touch that really ""makes"" the movie is the musical score by Michal Legrand.  The Brian's Song theme is a perfect blend of hope and sadness and is enough to make you cry all by itself.  Interestingly, the real Brian's wife, Joy, said that Legrand was one of his favorite composers.

The DVD contains a few ""extras"" including a so-so audio commentary by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan.  The commentary is witty in some spots, but it does not provide much insight into the movie's ""behind the scenes"" elements.  Caan reminds us that the movie was made only about a year after Brian Piccolo's death and several times he mentions that he felt the ""weight"" of playing the role of a person that the entire Chicago Bears team dearly loved.

If you enjoy this movie, I highly recommend that you read Jeannie Morris' biography of Brian Piccolo entitled Brian Piccolo: A Short Season.  It tells the whole story of Brian's life both on and off the field and goes into great detail about his illness and the tremendous courage and humor with which he faced it.",1179619200,10,3355,4.622259696458685

It is a 30 year old made for TV movie, so the production values are not great, but the story and the performances by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan are amazing.

520879,5,6302797713,"When I was playing HS football, this movie hit the air waves.  It did so with such a powerful stir as well.

Guys crying at or watching a movie was never heard of, but for weeks afterwards, my teammates and other friends admitted to crying when we all discovered that ""Pic"" had cancer and especially when he was told after an operation that he still did.

This is the first of many James Caan great acts.  The week before the Superbowl this year one of the networks showcased the foundations for cancer run by the families of Brian Piccolo and Walter Peyton.  It was amazing seeing old news footage and videos of Brian with his wife.  Caan and Fabresze looked just like them.

The movie really broke a lot of ground. First, a white and a black player sharing hotel rooms on the road.  Even coach Hallas warned them that there may be trouble.  But these two, who vied for the same position, would become the best of friends.

Piccolo even ups the ante when Sayers gets injured working with him to get back to playing.  Brian tells him that since he was second team, he did not want to be first team if Sayers could not play.  He told him he was going to beat him at his best and they worked together to get Sayers back in playing shape.

Eventually, they both start in the backfield and they are elated.

Brian's illness comes on quickly, yet you feel the sadness and the suffering of all around him.

After the movie I found the book written by Gayle Sayers entitled; ""I am Third.""  The movie was based on Sayers autobiography.  For anyone interested in playing sports at any level, this book is a must and is related to the movie for sure.

The movie shows that the ultimate of teamwork is working together and sacrificing for one another.

520886,4,6302797713,"`Brian's Song', the true story of Brian Piccolo and his fight against cancer, is one of the most critically acclaimed `made for TV' movies ever released.  This is due mostly to the heroic story and the acting chops of Mr. James Caan.  The film, chronicling the relationship between two football players for the Chicago Bears, one white and one black, showcases these two men as they bond over the course of time.  Brian (Caan) helps his teammate Gale Sayers (Billy Dee Williams) when he's injured during a game and is in need of physical therapy to heal his knee.  Likewise, when Brian is diagnosed with malignant cancer Gale is there by his bedside giving him emotional support, helping him put up his fight against his latest opponent.  Brian's fight was lost, but his story lives on.  The film is based on the novel `I am third' taken from the fact that Brian was always second (or even third) choice on the team, always being one of the best, but never `the' best due to players like Sayers.  The acting in this film is a bit lacking, although Caan giving yet another terrific performance, and Shelly Fabares does a fine job as Julie, Brian's loving wife, but Williams performance as the shy and reserved Sayers is a bit forced, and his breakdown in the locker upon hearing of Brian's condition is completely unbelievable.  Caan is an acting legend, and releasing this just before his brilliant turn in `The Godfather' was sure to get him noticed.  This film has been remade before, and the story has not changed, but it's Caan's Brian that I'll always remember.",1152489600,2,1566,4.686131386861314
520887,4,6302797713,"Billy Dee Williams looked more like Sayers than James Caan probably did Piccolo, considering Piccolo was a dark-haired Italian man and Caan had curly, light hair. Nonetheless, they portrayed Sayers' and Piccolo's personalities very well.

I have ""A Short Season"" by Jeannie Morris, ""I Am Third,"" by Gale Sayers, and both versions of ""Brian's Song."" It's interesting how Sayers and Piccolo were considered 'close friends' in the movie when Joy Piccolo confirmed that Ralph Kurek, another Bears' player, was Brian's best friend. As her quote went, ""Brian meant more than Gale than Gale meant to Brian.""

Another interesting fact is ""Brian's Song"" had Linda and Gale as a married couple, but only a short time later in 1974, Gale remarried and has been with the same woman for more than 30 years. He retired in 1971 or 1972, just after Brian passed away. So did Ralph Kurek. Joy Piccolo married again in 1974 too.

Brian passed away at the young age of 26. Gale and Joy know the acutal, first-hand accounts of Brian and Gale's relationship and how deep it went. Gale added only one chapter to his book ""I Am Third"" about his friendship with Brian after Brian passed away, and he published it. Ironically, that chapter became the focus of the movie only six months later and became a national success.

As Gale said, and I agree, it reminds me of the book ""Eric"" and the movie that was adapted from the book, which starred John Savage and Mark Hammill.

""Brian's Song,"" although true of Brian's harmless racist sarcasms and dear personality and Gale's shyness and fame, skims too close to exaggeration about their friendship but stands as a wonderful, inspiring movie.",1146528000,,1664,4.845070422535211

This heads my list of three football movies that everyone should see - Brian's Song, Rudy, and Remember the Titans. Did you notice that none of them are about football? All three are about friendship, fairness and rightness triumphing over preconceived notions of how things should be. The football is only a backdrop against which to set an exemplary story. I am talking the original movie here with James Caan and Billy Dee Williams. The new version doesn't even come close. I couldn't even finish watching it because I couldn't stop comparing it against the original. Also, the new version glossed over the fact that when Brian and Gale were paired as roommates, it was the first time ever in football that a white man and a black man were roommates and it generated a lot of bigotry at the time, as well as shining a much-needed spotlight on the issue of prejudice. Minimizing the race issue with 21st century ""political correctness"" is just sweeping it under the rug, our dirty little secret.

'Brian's Song' is really a well done, ahead of its time movie about friendship, loyalty, class lines, racism and death. Especially the dilemma we have in understanding the death of the young.

When Piccolo played for the Bears he was, at a very high level, an average (if that) running back. Even to this day, by comparison, #40 was and is a Chicago sports legend.

Bill Dee plays Gale Sayers with the same reserve, one could imagine, as Sayers was in the late 60's early 70's. And Caen plays Brian in the same way you can imagine Piccolo was, just grateful as all hell to be there.

Kudos to Jack Warden who plays the Papa Bear (best role still may be Paul Newman's mentor in Verdict) extremely well. The real benefit of a short (1 hour and 14 minutes) TV movie was that it was made so well.

This is a very tough movie to review for me because no words I put down can really do the film justice. It really takes a lot to make me cry but this movie really had me reaching for the tissues by the handfuls.

PLOT:

This is really at it's core an old-fashioned story about friendship; the friendship between to pro-football players: Brian Piccolo(James Caan) and Gale Sayers(Billy Dee Williams. Both play for the Chicago Bears and both play the same position. They start as rivals but quickly become friends after their coach, George Halas(Jack Warden), rooms the players together by the position they play. Later Gale gets injured and it's Brian who works Gale back into shape and encourages him back in the game. Then Brian starts losing weight and coughing a lot and getting slower so the coach sends him to the doctor. We discover that Brian has cancer. Through it all Gale sticks by Brian's side and we see what true friendship is all about.

CAST:

James Caan(Brian Piccolo): Caan has gave a lot of great performances in his career but he has never topped this one. He is so full of energy and love for life that we truly care about this man and his fate. Caan gave one THE greatest acting performances ever in this film and his last scene still hasn't been topped for sheer emotional power.

Billy Dee Williams(Gale Sayers): Williams gave his best performance in this film too. He starts out shy and slowly starts to become more outgoing with Brian's help. He made me cry almost as much as Brian did with his two speeches: one to the team when he finds out Brian's sick and the other when gets the Courageous Player Award.

Jack Warden(George Halas): This is one of Warden's best performances as well. It's a close tie with his performance in 12 Angry Men. I especially loved his narration at the beginning and end of the film.

Shelley Fabares(Joy Piccolo): I don't know anything about this actress other than that she gave a great performance as Brian's wife. When she goes over to Brian after Gale walks back to his wife it is one of the saddest, most heartbreaking scenes ever filmed between her and Caan.

CONTENT: A few minor curse words are all that would be here to offend anyone and some racist remarks but they aren't really meant to be offensive though some may take them that way. Also the subject matter may be to mature for some younger viewers.

EXTRAS: The excellent score by Michel Legrand is enough by itself to make your eyes water.

FINAL WORD: One of the greatest saddest and most emotionally powrful movies ever. I challenge you not to cry.",1122076800,5,2714,4.600414078674948
520904,5,6302797713,"On the accompanying commentary track, Billy Dee Williams facetiously trivialized this movie as ""a nice story about two guys who weren't gay."" I can't believe it's been 34 years since I first saw it as a 1971 ABC Movie of the Week. I remember crying like a baby and talking about it with my classmates at school the day after. All these years later, this moving film still makes me tear up. At a mere 73 minutes, it tells the now-familiar story of Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers, who both joined the Chicago Bears as running backs in 1965. While Sayers proved to be the superior player, Piccolo persevered with good humor and integrity as he helped Sayers recover from a potentially career-ending knee injury. The story is really about how they support and sustain each other, and when Piccolo develops lung cancer, it falls on Sayers to help him through as much as he can. Much of the film's power comes from William Blinn, who wrote a heartfelt, sometimes funny story about friendship and mutual respect without falling into cheap sentimentality, and credit obviously goes to veteran TV director Buzz Kulik, who guides this film expertly to unexpected emotional depths.

The two leads are stellar, and the chemistry between them near-perfect. On the verge of stardom as hothead Sonny Corleone in ""The Godfather"", James Caan portrays Piccolo as a genuinely likable, funny and determined guy who is convinced he will beat the odds. I doubt if he has played a role since with more emotional honesty, and in such a brief running time, he makes you care deeply about his character. With quiet strength and few words, Williams captures Sayers' initial reticence and increasing bond with Piccolo. In fact, he is responsible for two of the film's most heartbreaking scenes, both where Sayers needed to get out of his awkward comfort zone, first when he tells his teammates in the locker room that Piccolo is sick and then at the second awards banquet when he says with a lack of irony how he loves Piccolo. You are complete stone if you are not moved by these scenes. Jack Warden shows his dependably solid mix of macho gruffness and caring sensitivity as coach George Halas. The wives understandably take a back seat in the story with a post-Elvis era Shelley Fabares effective in her brief scenes as Joy Piccolo and Judy Pace even more in the background as Linda Sayers. Lending welcome realism, several Chicago Bears played themselves, including legendary linebacker Dick Butkus (before he became a TV actor), and the movie smartly includes archival footage of the real Piccolo and Sayers on the field. The beautiful, soaring music by Michel Legrand resonates still, especially the instantly familiar title theme. Keep in mind that ""Brian's Song"" was a TV-movie (still a concept in its infancy in 1971) made on the cheap with simple, reused sets and periodic fadeouts for the commercials that aired back then. I even recognized the Sayers house as Darrin and Samantha's house from ""Bewitched"". And truth be told, Caan and Williams looked more like track stars than football players. But the movie transcends those limitations in ways the producers could not have anticipated.

Watching the movie with the commentary by Caan and Williams yields an almost entirely different experience, comically irreverent as if two fraternity brothers reunited. While Williams gets more sentimental about the experience, Caan is flat-out funny as he talks about his fantasy to become a Chicago Bear, how much more athletic he was compared to Williams (which both agree was true), commenting on their physiques at the time, and even speculating some people like Blinn and actor David Huddleston were dead (in fact, they aren't according to imdb.com). Caan also reveals that the movie was made only six months after Piccolo's death and that he felt the weight of his portrayal early on when acting in front of the real Joy Piccolo. There is also a 12-minute by-the-numbers featurette, ""Gale Sayers: First and Goal"", with the real Sayers, who looks great thirty years later and true to character, doesn't let much emotion show when he talks about his friendship with Piccolo. I'm just so glad they have finally put this on DVD, as this movie was such a powerful touchstone for my generation.",1114128000,5,4267,4.925

Brian's Song is based on the true story of Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers. Both were rookies when they joined the Chicago Bears. Brian Piccolo(Caan) was the funny loudmouth that everybody loved. He wans't the most gifted athlete in the world and his determination made him the player that he was. Gale Sayers(Williams) was the quiet one. He was the easily the most talented player on the team maybe in the league. The two are paired as roomates and the friendship starts.
The two are opposites and don't get along that well at first. Opposites attract and they especially do with these two. They quickly feed off each other though and become the best of friends. They fuel each other and are inspeperable. They become the first white and black roomates in the NFL. They ignore the whole idea of race and are like brothers.
When Sayers tears his ACL the next year Brain gets the chance to step up and show his talent. He however feels for his friend and is determined to get Gale back into his form as the best RB in the league. There bond becomes even stronger during this time as does the friendship of there families.
The tide changes though when Brian starts not to play well. It's a new season and the two are enjoying finally playing with each other as one of the best backfields in the league. Brians play starts to diminsh though and he's sent to the doctor. What the doctor finds is that Brian has cancer and is terminal. It's now up to Gale to help his friend through this most difficult time of his life.
This movie isn't about football. It's about the bond of love and friendship that these two men have for each other. James Caan and Billy Dee Williams play these roles to perfection. Both weren't known all that well at this time in 1971. Caan hadn't delivered his legendary performance as Sonny Corleone and Wiliams hadn't played Lando yet. The two give dramatic performances though that are sure to make anybody cry.
This is one of the greatest tear jerkers of all time. I've never wathced it were a member of the audience isn't sobbing at the end of it. I've cried numerous times while watching this movie.
You can tell it's a tv made movie. It doesn't take away from the quality though and this movie cleaned the Emmy's out in 1971 and in my opinion is the greatest made for TV movie EVER!

That is most likely the case but whatever the reason be, this continues to be my favorite story of all time. The newer version seems to be more emotional and bring about more sorrow which is why I liked it more. It made you feel for Brian Piccolo more as he goes through his trying times. As for those who don't know the story, Brian is a football player who contracts cancer. His enemy turned friend, teammate, and competitor, Gale helps Brian and his wife through the pain of dealing with cancer and this is truly the saddest movie I have ever seen. The new version brought about tears at more than one point in the movie, and it takes a lot for me to cry during a movie. (This is still the only movie to this date that has actually made me cry) A definite classic that everyone should own. I will recommend the newer version based on my opinion, but I don't think it matters which one because this story has captured the love and emotion of those in my parents generation as well as those in my generation who have watched the newer version. The story of Brian  Piccolo will always be my favorite movie and everyone should see this and be exposed to his story. a definite MUST!!!",1050624000,4,1370,4.310077519379845
520909,5,6302797713,"Growing up as a kid, my brother and I watched this made-for-tv-movie every year.  And, everytime I heard the music near the end, it made me choke up.  Why?  The performances.  James Caan displays a charisma that pre-dates his awesome role as Sonny Corleone with a confidence and swagger that brought him movie star status.  The footage of Sayers galloping in real life is frighteningly graceful...superhuman...wonderful.  Give this movie a chance to help you discover what friendship, athletics and family mean.  It delivers.  And, will leave you moved...thinking about the frailty of human life.",1011312000,2,596,5.26595744680851
520920,5,6302797713,"Whe I heard that the folks at ABC were remaking ""Brian's song"",
 I was really upset... Why tamper with success,and why remake one of the most beautiful movies ever!  I saw Brian's song during its original broadcast back in 1971, and thought it was one of the best. James Caan and Billy Dee Williams are superb as Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers. The supporting cast, including Shelly Fabares as Joy and Judy Pace as Linda are also excellent as is Jack Warden as Papa Bear Halas. If you really want to see this movie go for the original!",1007078400,28,534,4.438775510204081
520921,5,6302797713,"Just wanted to say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The relationship depicted in this movie transcends racial, religious, and political differences.  Shame on ABC for remaking this movie.  This is a masterpiece and they should show this version instead of doing a remake.",1004227200,3,291,4.8979591836734695
520922,5,6302797713,"This would have to be classified as one of the best ever. The movie depicts the friendship of Brian Picolo and Gale Sayers. The two become roommates and as a result intimate friends. As football buffs well know Gale Sayers became one of the best running backs in this history of the game. This fine movie shows the careers of the two football players from up close. Brian Picolo is stricken with cancer. The support shown him by his friens Gale Sayers is very moving and touching. The characters of Picolo and Sayers are well played by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan. The plot is well above average. I could hardly wait for a new year to roll around so thar I could see Brian's Song again. Be forewarned,this is a tear jerker but also one of the better movies you will ever see.",991008000,2,781,4.393103448275862
520923,4,6302797713,"The true story of Chicago Bear Brian Piccolo and his steadfast friendship with fellow teammate, Gayle Sayers, will tug at your heart and make you want to call your friends, just to say thanks for the gift of friendship!  This film was done very well by James Caan & Billy Dee Williams.  The story of these two friends...to the death...is one the whole family can enjoy (there are some racial slurs, so beware in front of the children).  A must see by far!  And don't just bring it out at Super Bowl time...enjoy it all year long!  Yes, it's a football film, but it's so much more than that!",980726400,2,590,4.376146788990826
520924,5,6302797713,"I was fifteen years old when ""Brian's Song"" premiered as a ""Movie of the Week"" on ABC-TV.  I had no interest in sports then (I still don't), and had no intentions of watching this movie, but my dad persuaded me.  ""Just watch the first few minutes,"" he said.  He knew that this was NOT a sports movie.  He had read Gale Sayers' book ""I Am Third"" (upon which this movie is partially based), and knew that this was a movie about PEOPLE, not about football.  The fact that the two lead characters are football players is almost incidental.  This is a movie about friendship, love and courage.  Needless to say, I watched it from start to finish, and have watched it many times since.  Although its roots as a TV movie are obvious (the production values are nothing more than ordinary), ""Brian's Song"" is one of the most extraordinary films ever made, a particularly remarkable achievement when you consider its length of only 74 minutes.  James Caan and Billy Dee Williams, both virtual unknowns at the time, play Brian Piccolo and Gale Sayers with a sense of realism, and with respect for their real-life counterparts.  Jack Warden is excellent (as always) as coach George Halas, and Shelley Fabares and Judy Pace turn in fine performances as Joy Piccolo and Linda Sayers.  David Huddleston and Bernie Casey make the most of their small parts, and even real-life Chicago Bears provide some fine moments, particularly the ""hazing"" sequence.  The sincere performances, along with William Blinn's beautifully-written teleplay, keep the action from becoming mawkish or sappy, Buzz Kulik's direction brought out the best in his actors, and Michel Legrand's score comments on the emotions in the film with exactly the right tone.  (Legrand's penchant for marking musical cues to sudden movement onscreen is notable, and the gorgeous theme is one of the most emotionally charged pieces of music ever written.)  The film ends on a freeze-frame of James Caan's face over narration by Jack Warden of William Blinn's words, and when that musical theme pulls out all the stops after Warden's narration ends, well...even the Chicago Bears themselves would be dissolved in tears.  It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I would recommend it without reservation to anyone, sports fan or not.  Thanks, Dad.
The DVD version includes an exclusive short featurette, ""Gale Sayers: First and Goal"" in which present-day Gale Sayers discusses the movie and his career.  It's interesting, but nothing special.  Also included in audio commentary by Williams and Caan.  Caan is a cutup and does most of the talking, and little of any real substance is said, but it IS quite entertaining, and definitely worth another viewing.
But then, ""Brian's Song"" is ALWAYS worth another viewing...",972172800,105,2762,5.00437636761488
520925,5,6302797713,"I saw this movie when it first appeared on tv 29 years ago and I watched it again last night with my husband - needless to say, it is just as good  the 2nd time around.  Be very prepared to SOB multiple times; when  Gale/Billy Dee declares, ""I love Brian Piccolo"" it is one of the  most heartwrenching moments in movie history. Probably the best movie of  the week I've ever seen.",966902400,2,380,4.222222222222222
520926,5,6302797713,Brian's Song was made fo T.V. but became an instant classic. This movie combines gritty football from the decade that defined it the 50's in a division that portayed it the black and blue. Whach the grace of Gale  Sayers and the power of Brian Pickalow as they come into the league  together and learn from the master coach Halas. A beautiful friendship  forms and one of the saddest stories unfolds that only history could write.  I guarentee that you and your girlfriend will aprove.,960854400,,485,4.670588235294118
520927,5,6302797713,"What a powerful film. I had to stop the movie just to get back my composure. The part that I cry on is the locker room scene where Gale must tell his teammates that Brian has cancer. When he broke down, so did I. I like the relationship between Brian and Gale. It's not only competitive, but loving. Brian helps Gale back to 100% not only because he wants some competition, but also out of friendship and respect. The two become closer and eventually stand by one another. That is what makes Brian's Song the ultimate tearjearker. 5 stars all the way.",953164800,,551,4.411764705882353
