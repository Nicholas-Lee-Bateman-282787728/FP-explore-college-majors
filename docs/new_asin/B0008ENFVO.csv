2258125,5,B0008ENFVO,"I just saw the DVD...

Yes, Adam Garcia is so sexy! His butt is gorgeous (you can see it naked...this alone justified buying the DVD). And the love scenes are wild, unusual and beautiful. - If you are easily shocked by nudity and you pay a great deal of attention to proper social behavior (like my girl friend who is very religious) you are going to have a problem with parts of this movie. I guess this is meant with ""Disturbing"".  But I love it.

Dangerous: Adam  loves ""playing with fire"" , He is a daredevil with confidence since he believes that he has it under control - which is not always the case as it turns out. Nevertheless, I actually would love to have a boyfriend like Adam in ""Fascination"" who is ""sexy, disturbing and dangerous"". - but who is there to protect me...",1118448000,6,783,4.379310344827586
2258126,2,B0008ENFVO,"The first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline, so I won't go there.  I'll tackle the ending...WHAT ENDING?  I even backed it up to see what I missed. THEN, I went to the special features to see an alternate ending.  It varied little from the shows ending. After investing the time to see this movie, I hated the ending. However, Jacqueline Bisset is still very lovely. Adam Garcia didn't too badly and I did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces...!",1118016000,9,488,4.5227272727272725
2258127,2,B0008ENFVO,"""She's either the love of his life or the end of it"" reads the tagline for ""Fascination"". And that right there is a big tip-off for what kind of movie to expect. It gives the entire movie away.

 Patrick Doherty died in a swimming accident but the odd thing is he was an excellent swimmer, soon, 3 months to be exact his wife, Maureen (Jacqueline Bisset) is engaged to Oliver (Stuwart Wilson) to the dismay of her son Scott (Adam Garcia).

 Scott soon meets his step-sister Kelly (Alice Evan) and believe it or not an attraction starts. Soon Kelly, in subtle ways, starts to manipulate Scott's mind and starts making him think his mother killed his father.

 ""Fascination"" really wants to be a steamy sexy thriller. I can see it either as a cinemax late night movie or a WB TV series. The movie even goes as far as to have the guys walk around with open shirts to try and make us, or at least the women, think the movie is sexy. You could compare this movie to the works of Claude Chabrol, the dirty secrets of an upper-class family has always been one of Chabrol's favorite themes. But ""Fascination"" does not have the pleasure of being directed by Chabrol instead it is directed by Klaus Menzel. Menzel though makes the mistake of taking away all of the mystery of the film. He tries too hard to spell everything out of us. Events become too obvious and thus breaks all the suspense the movie could have created. That is a sign of Menzel's inexperience.

 I mentioned that Scott and Kelly have an attraction between them knowing full well they are about to become related. ""Fascination"" is now starting to open a whole new can of worms for itself as now it's dealing with incest. The reason I question this move is because the movie just doesn't seem interested in exploring these people and instead wants to focus on the mystery of whether Scott's father was murdered. To bring incest in the story means that you are going to have to examine the relationship between these people. ""Fascination"" does not dwell on the psychological aspect of these people.

 Then we have the terrible dialogue. It simply sounds phony. The scene where Scott meets Kelly is an embarrassment for the actors. The pick-up line he uses on her is corny. People don't really talk to each other this way. The movie has problem with that. Dialogue is not written in a convincing way. Even the music is wrong. It tries too hard to be alluring and sexy, like the movie itself. Menzel is hitting us over the head making sure no one walks out of this movie confused. While that is a very nice gesture on his part it really does take out all the suspense of the situation.

 ""Fascination"" has a twist up its sleeve that is just sprung on us. I think it's a cheap shot, you may not. Nothing leading up to this secret though is really suggested.

 Is ""Fascination"" a really bad movie? Not really. One is almost tempted to merely toss it aside as a ""guilty pleasure"". A movie that doesn't seem to have high ambitious but is entertaining nonetheless. Notice though I said one is ""almost"" tempted. That doesn't mean that I'm going to do that.

 Bottom-line: Despite the pleasure of seeing Jacqueline Bisset the movie doesn't have much to offer. Director Klaus Menzel tries too hard to spell everything out for us but the movie then comes cliche and predictable. The movie carries no suspense.",1117843200,4,3356,4.559068219633944
2258128,1,B0008ENFVO,"I'm an Adam Garcia fan but even he couldn't save this awful movie! The plot line is laughable. The acting (even Adam, sorry mate!) is pitiful. Save your money on this one. There was no chemistry between any of the actors particularly Adam and his love interest. Not good at all! My DVD is in the trash.",1252368000,6,302,4.315789473684211
2258129,3,B0008ENFVO,"No synopsys of the film from me.
Pics and marketing of a film are sure to get ones interest....but seeing the film is the final proof.
Had this script been read by people who know film than a lot of changes would have been made. This could have been a taught little thriller in the right hands....but it wasn't. Sometimes less is more...but this was overall too much. Alice Evans does the best with what she has to work with. The others are just making a film for TV.
You can't judge a DVD title by it's cover yet we often do. A pic is worth a thousand words and sometimes less after you have seen the film.",1192924800,,607,4.1525423728813555
2258130,2,B0008ENFVO,"Even though women viewers may love the bedroom scene because Adam Garcia is naked. . . (One reviewer already stated his butt alone is worth the price of the DVD.)
Even though men viewers may love the pool scene because Alice Evans strips off her wet panties. . .
This movie does not work. It doesn't work with either of its supplied endings. It doesn't work because soon after viewing other parts of the story start crumbling. It is a shame--there are creepy, interesting parts. With more nudity, it would have made great pornography; with more story, it would have been a classic.",1190937600,3,581,4.650485436893204
2258131,2,B0008ENFVO,"The DVD for ""Fascination"" has a great cover and makes you think this will be a romantic film set in exotic locations.  There really was only one beach location, which probably helped cut down on the budget.  Klaus Menzel's direction lends a sputtering pace and made me feel the picture was going downhill as it changed from romance to attempted thriller.  James Naughton from 1974's ""The Paper Chase,"" ""First Wives Club"" & ""Devil Wears Prada"" plays the father whose swimming accident casts an early shadow over the film.  Adam Garcia plays his son Scott.  Garcia has been in a number of films including ""Bootmen,"" ""Coyote Ugly"" & ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.""  However, I didn't quite remember him, nor would his rather wooden self-absorbed performance and his flat vocal affectation be likely to make me recall him from this film.  However, he does a good job in the bare bottom love scenes.  Scott's mother is lovely Jacqueline Bisset who has had a long career since she first claimed fame as Giovanni Goodthighs in ""Casino Royale"" back in 1967 and went on to work with Francois Truffaut in ""Day for Night.""  She has 4 Golden Globe nominations with the most recent being in 1999 for ""Joan of Arc.""  She does a good job as the mother Maureen who has an affair that turns into her second husband.  Unfortunately, her taste in men does not improve as husband #2 appears to be on a revenge mission for husband #1 who let husband #2's wife #1 drown -- in short, the plot is a bit contrived and confusing with more twists and turns than common sense.  Husband #2 is Oliver Vance played by Stuart Wilson from ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" ""Wild Things,"" ""Lethal Weapon 3"" & ""Enemy of the State.""  As the bad guy, he is overbearing and a bit revolting.  His intimacy with his adopted daughter turns him into a real sleaze merchant.  His adopted daughter Kelly has the most confusing of roles, confusingly written, although actress Alice Evans does as good of a job as possible with this.  Why a girl who survived the streets of Johannesburg decides to try to jump out of a car at the end of the movie didn't make sense to me.  Such was the bundle of contradictions of this character.  How could she allow herself to be used by her stepfather?  Why would she still feel allegiance to him?  The only real answer is the screenwriter wanted her in the movie; and that's how she arrived.  Evans has worked in ""National Lampoon's Blackball,"" ""My Wife Maurice"" & ""102 Dalmatians.""  This role will hardly catapult her onto Hollywood's ""A"" list.  The actors bravely stick with this turkey that does have some nice love scenes & one tropical location.  Otherwise, you'll be wondering how much longer until it's over.  The alternate ending apparently had Garcia dead; so I'm glad they picked the ending they did.  Taxi!",1156896000,5,2807,4.677551020408163
2258132,4,B0008ENFVO,"I rented this DVD because I've seen Adam Garcia in other movies.  I thought the movie was good and kept me in suspense with some of the unexpected twists & turns. Alice Evans was pretty good too (although I did get confused about who she ""really"" was at times).  Overall, it's definitely a movie worth watching.",1149206400,5,311,4.535714285714286
2258133,4,B0008ENFVO,"Klaus Menzel's debut as a director is a compelling combination of a Film Noire and a tragic lovestory. ""Fascination"" is more about the consequences of a crime than crime itself. It deals with obesession, distrust and intrigue that change the perfect world of a high society family into a living nightmare. Grand actors like Jaqueline Bisset and Stuart Wilson but also the newcomers Adam Garcia and Alice Evans convince as lead characters in this ""dangerous"" lovestory. The soundtrack contributes perfectly to this exciting and unconventional thriller that made the audience hold their breath until the very end.",1130371200,10,611,5.309278350515464
2258134,5,B0008ENFVO,"A thriller riddled with paranoia and distrust. FASCINATION is an acute study of a man stretched to breaking point by an egregious set of circumstances. Scott (Adam Garcia- who is always great looking and a wonderful actor!) is both stricken and confused when his mother, Maureen (Jacqueline Bisset), announces she is going to marry another man named Olilver (Stuart Wilson) just three weeks after the tragic death of his father, who drowned.

Scott looks on in horror, although he falls for Oliver's very attractive and shapely daughter, Kelly (Alice Evans). Equally suspicious of the impending nuptials, Kelly joins Scott in an investigation into the foggy circumstances surrounding his father's death...

Stylistically tilting towards the dusky shadows of classic film noir, FASCINATION plays an exquisite guessing game with its viewers, who should take nothing for granted in this inventive and stimulating movie.",1126915200,14,916,5.48936170212766
2258135,5,B0008ENFVO,"I just saw ""Fascination"" because I liked the DVD cover and had seen pretty much everything else new. Wow! What a film. It's a brilliant thriller that really draws you in and spits you out again. You start thinking it's going to be just a usual film about a man who gets murdered and the people in his life trying to deal with it: then it becomes a murder mystery and then suddenly a really hot love story. I really believe this film should have been shown in theatres and not be on DVD. But the best thing is Adam Garcia, who I discovered with this film. I now have to see everything this beautiful man has ever made. Dind't like the girl, but maybe that was just jealousy. Go see it: you won't be disappointed.",1125878400,8,711,4.235294117647059
2258136,1,B0008ENFVO,"Looking for a really good thriller, I spotted ""Fascination,"" with Jacqueline Bisset and was sure that with her and the cast, my husband and I had found the perfect summer film on DVD.  What a disappointment.  Although Bisset rallies to the role, the same cannot be said of the other actors.  The dialogue is painfully inept at conveying anything in the least bit sexy, provocative or psychologically intriguing.  The cloying, saccharine musical score doesn't help.  Whereas the music in ""The Swimming Pool,"" or ""The Wide Sargasso Sea,"" enhances, heightens the dramatic intensity, mystery and sensuality, the musak in ""Fascination,"" undermines whatever potential drama there might be. The characters other than Bisset and her unfortunate first husband seem too infatuated with themselves to be erotically convincing. As an ensemble cast, they seem indifferent to both the story and their audience.  Magnificent bodies and sexy entanglements are not enough, in my opinion, to compensate for the pedestrian acting and rather predictable plot.

  Jacqueline Bisset deserves better and so do we viewers.",1124409600,8,1098,5.449704142011834
