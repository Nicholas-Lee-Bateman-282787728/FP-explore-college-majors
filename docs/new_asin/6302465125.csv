Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp"" is absolutely exceptional.  Darker and more mature than the more famous Disney variation, it is graced with a perfect cast.

Starring Robert Carradine, Valerie Bertinelli, and James Earl Jones, it tells the story adapted from ""The Arabian Nights"" with flair and impressive visual effects.  Robert Carradine plays Aladdin with a natural humility, yet also just the right amount of ambition, and Valerie Bertinelli is absolutely stunning as Princess Sabrina, the young royal who fires Aladdin's heart.  Additionally, Bertinelli exudes an innate intelligence and class which suits her character very well.  James Earl Jones plays two different genies in this production, one originating from a ring which Aladdin wears, the other from the titular lamp.  Simply put, he is amazing and a natural to play the fanciful characters.  His forceful, loud, and fairly bizarre interpretations of each respective genie is light years removed from Robin Williams' jokey, friendly genie, and in subtle ways even better.  I do have to warn parents that Mr. Jones' performance may scare small children, though.

Also starring Leonard Nimoy, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp"" is an extremely entertaining, strong entry in the series.",1268265600,,1307,5.49

7826420,4,6302465125,"ALADDIN AND HIS WONDERFUL LAMP is one of the most enjoyable of episodes from the fabulous FAERIE TALE THEATRE series. Robert Carradine, Valerie Bertinelli, James Earl Jones and Leonard Nimoy lead the strong cast.

Aladdin is played by the appealing Robert Carradine, who offers a fine performance as the resourceful young hero who is thrown into a world of wonder, danger and romance after discovering a lamp which contains a Genie (James Earl Jones) who will grant his every wish. Unfortunately, a scheming magician (Leonard Nimoy) also knows about the magical lamp and will stop at nothing to get it...

Valerie Bertinelli is luminous as the beautiful Princess Sabrina who steals Aladdin's heart. She was nominated for several awards for her performance here. James Earl Jones is an amazing Genie; big and boistrous and very funny!

Directed by Tim Burton, ALADDIN comes to life with sparkling sets and vivid costumes. One of the best. Co-starring Rae Allen as Aladdin's mother and Ray Sharkey as the Grand Vizier.",1099008000,15,1016,5.07185628742515
7826421,4,6302465125,"While an all-white cast of arabs is little embarassing in the more enlightened 21st century, the strength of the cast is amazing for such a small project.
Lenord Nimoy as the evil Sorcerer!
James Earl Jones as the Genies of the Ring and the Lamp!
And if it gives you an idea of what to expect from the film, this rare little production was Tim Burton's first professional Directing job!  His cave of wonders is remarkably creepy given the shoestring budget.",1054512000,3,457,4.6419753086419755
