8115964,3,B000EZP6PA,"This really suffered from trying to take lower resolution analog recordings into DVD format.  The DVD states they did the best they could, but I didn't take points away from them in rating the DVD.  Some of the women give a dialog about posing, etc., which adds some interest to the posing.  Unlike another of Frazier's DVDs that was originally in analog format, that one added still photos so that added resolution made up for the lower resolution video.",1522281600,,455,4.734177215189874
8115965,3,B000EZP6PA,"It was not especially satisfying as nude videos go. I hope to find something that is much sexier and exciting. ""Ultimate Sexual Massage"" is more for me.",1391904000,,152,4.666666666666667
8115966,5,B000EZP6PA,Full of information and well narrated. I was looking for someone with experience to guide me and I got it here.,1360108800,,111,4.333333333333333
8115967,2,B000EZP6PA,"This film has very beautiful women in it. To bad you don't see them clearly. The picture quality is very poor. It is blurry, grainy, dark and some stop motion effect which ruins it. It looks like they took it from an old warn out VHS. This is the first video I have watched from this company. I have Frazier's Favorites, which I have not watched yet. If the picture quality is as bad as this one, I will not buy another. If the picture was clear I would give this a high rating. As it is, I do not recommend.",1301356800,3,508,4.03960396039604
8115968,3,B000EZP6PA,"I purchased this DVD and a couple others put out by this director. The content on this DVD was shot on what I assume was a VHS camera, so the quality is not so hot.

Some of the information is also dated. I'm guessing it was produced in the early 90s. There is still mention of shooting on film.

This DVD is for beginners, but the host does not go into much detail. Most of the subjects are ""skimmed over"". Even so, there is actual footage of an actual model in an actual studio with actual lighting in an actual work situation, so I have to at least add a plus for that. Some of the newer DVDs out don't even do that. Just read some of my other reviews.

One thing that had me thinking ""huh?"" was that there were several provocative scenes where the camera would pan up on the model from her legs to her face. I thought that was a little ""blue"" for an instructional video.

All in all I think this DVD was good for it's time, but is not so valid today. I would be very interested in seeing any new material being put out by this director. I say If you can get this DVD for under 15 bucks.... buy it.",1169251200,3,1101,4.036697247706422
