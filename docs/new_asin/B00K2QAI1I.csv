For each of these devices, there is an appropriate speed on the DVD. I really enjoyed the autumnal colors. The quality of the videos and the natural background noise is excellent, as on all the other Virtual Walks DVDs that I own. It makes a great fun to walk or drive through the magnificent countryside of the Provence. You enter through quaint little villages, see the great rocky landscape and you can enjoy the sight of the autumnal colors of the fields and trees during your training. This DVD is once again an asset to my Virtual Walks collection.",1442102400,,686,4.540322580645161
8655454,3,B00K2QAI1I,I have only used the first walk so far.  It is pretty scenery and interesting but the pace moves a little too fast for me as I casually walk on the treadmill.  The scenery goes by quickly in some parts and could almost make me feel dizzy as I get car sick easily.  It may not bother anyone else.,1439337600,,295,3.9661016949152543
8655455,5,B00K2QAI1I,"I bought my first Tony Helsloot, World Nature Video over twelve years ago and I am still buying them.  I have purchased many nature videos.  If I had found this company's videos sooner, I wouldn't have purchased any of the others.  This DVD is no exception.  It is professionally filmed with stabilizers for a smooth, high quality film.  It is HD and the color and clarity are brilliant.

There is three 20 minute walks on this DVD.  The variety of scenery includes; cliffs and mountains, the bright colors of autumn, a picturesque, and the natural colorful vegetation and scenery of Southern France.

This is a great tool to make your exercise routine more interesting...whether you're cycling on a stationary bike, jogging or walking on a treadmill or using your gazelle.  I own several of these Virtual Walk DVDs.  I rotate them regularly and find that my exercise routine is no longer dreadful...I actually look forward to it.  It's like traveling without the expense and staying healthy at the same time.

I liked the first walk and the third walk the best, so I still gave this 5 stars because they were great.  However, the second walk was a bit too fast for just walking and I really didn't like the cars buzzing past.",1434758400,2,1226,4.699530516431925
8655456,5,B00K2QAI1I,This is my favorite of the 3 videos that my son bought me. Thanks Jared. I enjoy taking a walk through France and it reminds me of our trip to Cagnes Sur Mer. Enjoy the scenery and little houses and villages. Right walking pace. Keeps my interest.,1419897600,,247,4.276595744680851
8655457,4,B00K2QAI1I,"I have to agree with other reviewers, walk number two is too fast for walkers.....joggers maybe but I would have preferred walking speed. Walk number one is my favorite..with all the curves and cerulean blue skies I half expected to see a modern day Cezanne out there painting at his easel. Much of this DVD was videoed during the ""golden hour"".... when the light throws long shadows and the sunlight renders the countryside in warm shades. It's really quite enjoyable to "" be there"".  Walk number three again shows the countryside but with a few buildings. I miss seeing people though. I find people are ""markers"" during a virtual walk and many treadmill videos could be on a loop they get so repetitive. Even if the people talked to the videographer..all the better..that's what would happen if I were out walking. Also my head would gaze left and right as I walked....just a mild suggestion that would make the experience even more real.  Finally ( this is not a negative, just a personal preference), I would love the actual sounds...footfalls and all.....an unwavering overlay of chirping birds takes away from the virtual reality for me...if its really dead silent except for the videographers breathing..that's fine.. I'd be breathing too!",1418860800,,1246,4.956937799043062
8655458,4,B00K2QAI1I,"This walk consists of 3 videos. I loved #1 and #3 - they're beautiful and kind of what I expected from rural France. You don't see a bunch of people, just great scenery and you really get a sense of peace and a kind of seclusion in where it's filmed. The mountains and gorges are breathtaking sights. The buildings really are ""picturesque"" - I thoroughly enjoyed both of these videos and will no doubt watch them again. I had to take off 1 star because of the second walk (I would have taken off only a half star, but I don't think you can do that) - the scenery itself is great, but the sight and sounds of cars roaring past me threw off my enjoyment of that particular walk. There weren't a whole lot of them but each one distracted me too much to fully enjoy the scenery. Overall, had it not been for the cars, I would have given it 5 stars. The south of France is another beautiful place to see. I'm glad I have this DVD, along with many others of Tony Helsloot's.",1413504000,2,968,4.181818181818182
8655459,5,B00K2QAI1I,"Some strange reviews to say the least. How could anyone NOT enjoy this! To be honest we do own a lot of Virtual Walks DVD's and I would actually say this is one of the best (but then we love the South of France). The films are actually good enough to just watch on their own and the quality is, as ever, simply outstanding. My wife and I don't like exercising but these videos have made all the difference. It sometimes feels very odd to be running on a treadmill in our apartment and yet feel for a few moments on top of a mountain somewhere. I heartily recommend this dvd as the rest of the collection. If you are looking to put a bit of fun in your exercise regime this has to be the best way yet! Who needs a gym?",1413331200,,717,4.020979020979021
8655460,5,B00K2QAI1I,"I love this walk! It has such beautiful, breathtaking views! Once again, as with the other walks that I have, you can choose from 3 different walks so never boring. Perfect for a rainy day or any day you just want to jump on the treadmill, bike or just walk in your living room.

8655461,2,B00K2QAI1I,"I'd give this a 1 1/4 stars if it were possible. I have most of the FITNESS JOURNEYS, The Ambient Collection DVD's, which are a pure joy to watch when I'm on my treadmill walks. On those DVD's, you get to choose which scenic walk you want, slow, moderate, or fast, but, on this DVD, once the first slow walking ends, it quickly goes to next video...way too fast, and once you get use to the scene, this video ""turns the page"", time after time! How can the virtual walk feel real if ""pages"" are truning to the next scene?  If you want a true sense of walking along a country road etc., and experience something that makes you feel like you are there, get  the older Ambient Collections Fitness Journeys:  Through the Forest 2, Forest & Bush Trails, Tropical Scemery, Natural Scenery, and Australian Landscape. Those videos are all amazing, NOT this DVD...!.",1408838400,2,856,4.545454545454546
8655462,3,B00K2QAI1I,"Walk # 1 is beautiful and secluded, at a normal walking speed, but didn't see any picturesque village (just one house on the side of the road).  Walk # 2 missed the mark: The speed is that of a motorbike or car and is too fast to be simulating a bicycle ride or a run (the filming crew even overtakes several cyclists going up hill!).  Watermills? Didn't see any.  Walk # 3 is at a good speed for jogging or cycling, along nice country roads, culminating in a rustic building on the side of the road.  I am missing a proper French village though!",1408492800,2,546,4.221153846153846
