4565902,5,B0054DPLDY,"I ordered this collection early in October - as Halloween was approaching - and am not disappointed with my purchase!  This is the first ""collection"" of any kind that I've ever ordered, which has been recorded and published by The History Channel - and after watching two of the four DVDs - have been extremely pleased with my purchase!  Towards Halloween annually, I tend to develop a bit of a bent for ghost stories, and (lightly) compelling thriller movies - as many people do, I think.  This four DVD collection does a good job of ""reviewing"" some of the truly ""haunted"" cities throughout the U.S.  The narration is well-researched, and done with appropriate vocal inflection - which is always important to me, if you're going to be narrating something like this.  Each ""review"", while suspenseful - is not overly freaky.  All of that being said, I feel that this collection makes a GREAT addition to any Halloween movie ""collection"" !!",1385164800,3,940,4.84375
4565903,5,B0054DPLDY,Love the story and the history combined. I have been to most of the places yet still loved the dvd.,1381708800,,99,4.0

4565906,5,B0054DPLDY,"Love the entire DVD... Must see! Haunted Chicago and Tombstone was my favorites... Haunted D.C., Hawaii, and Savannah were great as well!",1367625600,3,137,5.2727272727272725
4565907,5,B0054DPLDY,Great item.  My friend is a haunted fanatic and she loved this.  Is really very interesting and a great item for the ghost hunter.,1361145600,3,130,4.375

4565909,2,B0054DPLDY,"Many of these stories are old hat, but the acting was very well done.  for someone just entering the fascination of the paranormal and it's related stories, this is one of the BETTER ones.  If I had to pick a DVD to see these episodes for the first time, I wouldn't pick anything else first!",1356739200,,291,4.2727272727272725
4565910,1,B0054DPLDY,"I never heard of America's Most Haunted Places and since I love anything paranormal I thought i'd give it a whirl. I got the set and looked in the back-damn it! This is the set of Haunted History: America's Most Haunted Places set. All they did is make it a smaller case, a different cover, and took off Haunted History. I love the show and seen the entire series. Matter of fact, they could have released the other shows rather then repackage the same set. Overall, i'm disappointed for dropping 15 for a set I already own. You can read my review of the original set if you want. If you don't own this set then I do recommend it, although it's not the best series on the paranormal.",1325635200,22,683,4.3023255813953485
4565911,4,B0054DPLDY,"I LOVE this stuff. I am a huge fan of paranormal research and while most investigations don't turn up anything, I still get a thrill out of it. If you are a fan of this type of genre, you will love this DVD.

Is Tombstone haunted? I don't know but I enjoy hearing the testimonials and seeing the reenactments. The birdcage is one of those places I really want to visit. Can Can dancers and gunslinger ghosts sound like fun.

Choking ghosts in Hawaii make me think I may not be visiting anytime soon. Well, that and the cost of the heading there.",1319414400,12,545,4.281553398058253

4565938,5,B0054DPLDY,"I like a few enjoy the History Channel, so when I got this 5 CD set for a friend,we both were intrigued by the stories told. I'm a paranormal fanatic and have encountered a few experiences in my day. So we both enjoyed the stories.",1474675200,,231,4.155555555555556
4565939,4,B0054DPLDY,"Not the best on the topic but certainly not the worse.  They stick to the topics and don't bring in any ""experts"" who say the craziest things like many things on the History Channel now, that is a plus.  I am willing to order the others in the series and give it a chance.",1469318400,2,272,4.018518518518518

4565967,5,B0054DPLDY,"I very much enjoyed all of these, although in my set at least, all but one disc was mis-labeled as to what city it was, all the cities that were supposed to be there are, just not on the disc that's marked for it, a minor annoyance, but nothing that detracts from the quality of the show.",1430265600,,288,4.0701754385964914
4565968,5,B0054DPLDY,I loved most of the stories because most of the ghosts were harmless.  Hawaii was different.  I loved reading and hearing about ghosts as long as they don't harm anyone.  I was raised on stories like Topper and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.,1430006400,,235,4.4186046511627906
4565969,2,B0054DPLDY,"The first couple shows were good.  However, the guy that narrates it, his voice is so irritating.  He tries to sound eerie and laughs a really stupid laugh during is narrations.  It's so....well....irritating.",1428624000,,209,5.2727272727272725

4566002,3,B0054DPLDY,"The stories are good, my problem is with the DVD's themselves.  It's a small thing, but the programs are not on the DVD's as labeled.  The program that is  listed on a DVD is actually on another DVD in the series,  They are all jumbled up",1424304000,,238,4.108695652173913
4566003,4,B0054DPLDY,"We watched the first Tombstone story.  It was great!  W are looking forward to watching the remaining DVD's.  However, 4 of the 5 discs were mislabeled.  Tombstone has a Washington, DC label, Washington, DC has a Tombstone label, Chicago has a Savannah label and Savannah has a Chicago label.  Hawaii was labeled correctly.  Since all 5 discs were there, I will not be returning the DVD's. Nothing that post-it labels could not correct but that was pretty weird, though!  We are wondering if anyone else had this factory mix up?",1418688000,3,528,4.8
