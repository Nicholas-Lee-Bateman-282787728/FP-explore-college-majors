7786429,5,B01HEXVJJG,This anime series is one of my favorite being very great in all aspects. It very dark n some adult situation but overall a great anime highly recommended.,1473292800,3,154,4.535714285714286
7786430,5,B01HEXVJJG,"Easily one of the most gripping animes I have had the pleasure to watch. I watched the whole first season in a matter of days and loved every moment. I loved the plot, and the character inteinteractions. I especially loved Akane's development and her relationship with Kogami. Whether subtly romantic or not they had a very unique bond that was built upon trust and respect and during their last mission where she gives him her Dominator and takes his pistol filled me with so much excitement. Just the way they moved in synch and worked off each other, and the dialogue. I could go on and on but I haven't even talked about the villain. Makishima was an absolute joy as a villain. I especially loved the interactions between him and Kogami, and how they could read one another.

Anyways this anime is amazing and I'm glad I saw it.",1506384000,,832,4.546666666666667

7786432,5,B01HEXVJJG,"Not only is this series an awesome allegory it is meta on so many beautiful levels. This is a series that has high replay value as you can always catch something missed previously as once you can hear everything being said on top, the subtle lower layers come through. An excellent if disturbing vision.",1493596800,4,303,4.62962962962963

7786437,5,B01HEXVJJG,"I absolutely love this series. If youve ever seen Minority Report, with Tom Cruise, you will like this. They are pretty similar, except this is aime, and the characters are more good looking. Lots of action. I LOVE IT",1487462400,,217,4.589743589743589
7786438,5,B01HEXVJJG,"Like Ghost in A Shell, this has many provocative concepts embedded in an exciting police procedural. I sympathized quickly with many of the protagonists and worried over them incessantly. Very highly recommended.",1487116800,,212,5.65625

7786440,5,B01HEXVJJG,"Such a great series. The story, the characters, the world, the music... Ohhh the music (EDs by Egoist)...it all just works. The dub was well done as expected of Funimation. If you're not into anime this would be a great title to watch. If you're an anime fan... What are you waiting for?",1485129600,,287,4.433962264150943
7786441,5,B01HEXVJJG,Great anime very graphic not for kids under a certain age but great show. Take anime and mix in CSI and you have a great show. Love it.,1484006400,,135,3.857142857142857

7786444,5,B01HEXVJJG,"I like my anime how I like my films and TV dramas; so Minority Report and The Wire = yes. No high school, just good characters, animation, and arguing philosophy. Finally, a show for actual adults you can truly own.",1482192000,3,215,4.4
7786445,5,B01HEXVJJG,Great anime series,1480723200,,18,5.333333333333333
7786446,5,B01HEXVJJG,A great anime series.  It's like it was written by Philip K. Dick.,1480636800,,66,4.076923076923077
7786447,5,B01HEXVJJG,"I remember seeing a trailer for this series and something drawing me in. Perhaps it was this futuristic world, or the cyberpunk feeling it exuded, but the first episode of Psycho-Pass lets you know that you will go on a journey and that everything that followed...was it fate?

This series deals with a world in which people's brains are constantly scanned to see if they have criminal tendencies and each scan gives them a  color and number- their Psycho-Pass. People who have numbers that are too high will either be given treatment, but if treatment cannot cure them, another fate awaits them.

This is an amazing series because it always has you thinking and feeling and eventually, even you as a viewer will come to dissect the way that you think and what it can say about you. Is the world in this series safe? Is it just? Are these people free?

By the end of this series, I knew that the emotions I had at its end meant that it was more than good, but I found that for days later I continued to think about it, and that's why I will say that I highly recommend this series. I've re-watched it, and its meanings become more clear each time. it's a series that lingers.",1479772800,,1175,4.425925925925926
7786448,5,B01HEXVJJG,"Great price for the entire first season of this groundbreaking anime!

Psycho Pass is a very dark, bloody, and tragic story set in a dystopian future 100 years from now. The first season's writer, Gen Urobuchi (Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero), does an incredible job at creating a beautiful and complex world that you find yourself drawn into. Once this technologically advanced world is fully fleshed out, he turns it upside down on its head. My favorite part about this anime is that it really makes you to think. A lot is said about human nature, law, and governance. The line between good and evil is blurred.  The compelling and suspenseful storytelling will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the 22 episodes. The show's animation quality is on par with some of the best anime out there.

Overall, Psycho Pass Season 1 is a very enjoyable, innovative show that is something different than most anime out there at the moment. It has quickly become one of my favorite anime of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a mature, dark themed anime.",1478649600,3,1067,4.725806451612903

8765288,3,B01HEXVJJG,"Soo, the blu rays play and the quality of the anime and sound is fantastic. My issues aren't with the series. One of the menus had this weird glitch where you could see the moving background through the gray part by the menu options.  I replayed the disc I thought it was on and it was normal. The case quality is nothing special, be careful so that it holds up over time. That can be said in general for funimation collections. This is a small issue,  but the previews you get (1 different show preview per disc),  sometimes the audio (speaking) is majorly dwarfed by the music and I can't hear the speaking without turning it way up **NEW ISSUE: on the blu-ray disc 1, after watching the ep5 commentary, the menu disappeared. Like, the animation the runs behind it, that was the only thing there. No skipping allowed, no options to escape. WTH. Is this a glitch or??",1526860800,,868,4.446540880503145
