1783643,4,B00006L926,"John Sayles has a style of telling stories that takes a bit of patience on the part of the viewer.  He seems to like 'free-association' thinking and unless you stay alert, some of his tales can slip right by.  SUNSHINE STATE  has so many little stories under the umbrella of a tale of redevelopment agencies vying for an old established island off the coast of Florida to turn into yet another dreary housing complex that even though Sayles keeps them all tied together in the end, the various life situations presented can wander out with the tide.  There is the element of racism conquered (or is it?), a returning 'lost daughter' (Angela Bassett), a frustrated woman (Edie Falco, in a touching and very Southern role)left to run a motel and restaurant for her diabtetic father rather than follow her dreams, an orphan who witnessed his parents murder/suicide, a committed do-gooder (Mary Steenburgen) whose whole life seems tied up in a silly weekend Bucaneer Days celebration, and a misplaced Sarah Bernhardt (so good to see Jane Alexander back in the movies) trying to bring some semblance of culture to the resort folk, etc etc.  What we are given is a slice of small town mentality fighting to stay afloat and Sayles elicits fine performances from a sterling cast.  The ending (and beginning) are just edgy enough to qualify as an art house flick and the film just doesn't seem to know when enough is enough.  But we are left with indelible portraits of some very interesing characters who challenge some home-grown prejudices and make us stop along this beautiful little beach and breathe in.......and just meander.",1037836800,5,1623,4.88
1783664,5,B00006L926,"This movie is a lot of fun, says something about its characters and comments upon burying the past and implementing the new in the United States.

Eminent Domain in Florida plagues the lives of poor white and black residents of a neglected community, now coming into view of developers. They want to build another exclusive, beachfront, senseless community for snowbirds.

The developers are like presidential candidates, coarse, crude, vulgar, boasting, petty, ignorant, money-driven and vile with opponents who are enemies. Political incorrectness, obnoxiousness and being rude and offensive are common. There is a full-blooded Creek Native American, who is sh-t creek. The developers are bought partially the City, County and regulatory bodies to get approval for all development. One means to get all the property is develop partially and drive up property taxes so the poorer residents cannot afford them.

Bucaneer Days, a local festival once again fails to become a community tradition to attract tourists. Angela Bassett and her husband, James McDaniel, visit her mother, Mary Alice, after decades of separation. That story plays out and dovetails into the grab for real estate riches. Edie Falco operates an older motel/restaurant and looks after her parents, Jane Alexander and Ralph Waite. They represent the change that the world is bringing to the community without the developers.

In the end development is stopped. A Native-American burial site (arrowheads) is discovered.",1455321600,,1488,5.4847161572052405

I don't mind watching a sleeper where it's a 'talkie' picture, but there has to be something there to keep one interested.  The pay off at the end was disappointing and lasted about a minute.

1783685,3,B00006L926,"Ah yes, developer versus Florida. It's all too true, I can attest, as a resident. This film intertwines several story lines to make a whole about the loss of old Florida, along the northern east coast, though the geography in the film is a bit muddled. The characters are at Weekie Watchie one minute, and that is all the way across the state on the west coast north of Tampa. Then they appear to be in a fictional Daytona Beach area, but somewhat north of the real location way over on the northern east coast. The scenery is lush, but the story line is a bit pallid. Nothing is very compelling here. Is this a comedy? Or a tragedy? And why is it 2 hours and 15 minutes long? This is a 90 minute movie, if ever I saw one.",1267660800,,722,4.164285714285715

1783689,3,B00006L926,"Here's a movie that you hate to give an average rating to but it can't be helped. ""Sunshine State"" has a lot of great characters with a lot of great promise. That's the good, as well as, the bad part for this picture.

The cast delivers an A-list performance and you're quickly drawn into the story centered around an old beach community. There's plots that branch off from the main theme dealing with homecomings, an old community scandal, issues concerning today's crumbling families, hanging onto tradition while making room for progress-I could go on and on. You sit and fully invest yourself in these people but in the end the plot is just a snap shot in the life of these characters. This thing could have been a series, or at least, a mini-series and I could have kept coming back. In the end I was just teased and left wanting to know how they all came out. Loose endings in a movie I don't mind but not this many. Obviously that's what writer and director John Sayles wanted the viewer to leave with at the closing credits. All those questions which the viewer has to resolve for themselves. Too many for my book but make a sequel and I'll be there.",1189641600,,1158,4.462264150943396
1783690,5,B00006L926,"sayles is one of the most talented underrated filmmakers of our day. it seems to me a film like this should have at least made a hit with the indie-hipster crowd, but i guess the wry humor may be lost on the other 49 states, myself being a third generation floridian. if you plan on visiting florida, you really oughta watch this movie first. you'll appreciate the place better afterwards. the movie is shot entirely on location, a number of places i've been numerous times. he really nailed every beat in this slice-of-life kind of film. (over)developers have come to renovate a sleepy island town and some of the inhabitants are rather reticent about seeing their heritage replaced with convenience stores and condos. this is the premise, and from here, Sayles lets the characters take over, and in no hurry. they are all interesting enough, though, to hold our attention and are extremely believable (they could all be my neighbors). the most endearing character for me, though, is the locale itself, replete with gators, mom-and-pop stores, scars of segregation (people forget mickey's winter home is below the mason-dixon), gators, greedy commercialists, seminoles-gone-redneck, southern rock bands, and retirees. i may be biased, but this film is the transcendance of the mundane at its best",1182124800,2,1297,5.093896713615023
1783691,1,B00006L926,"After reading some truly scathing reviews of this 2002 film (NOT including the word-of-mouth reactions of other movie fans I know), I decided to watch it to see if their opinions were correct......they were. I am a true movie buff myself: I get great satisfaction from settling into my chair (with a good snack of course) and unwinding from daily stress by watching an entertaining DVD.....but my day only got worse when I plugged in the ""bordom fest"" known as Sunshine State. I forced myself to endure all of it; more than two hours of people literally doing nothing (well, I'm afraid that's not really fair; they DO chat an aweful lot....but thats it). I had read the film was a comedy/drama. Well, besides having to pay real close attention to identify a dramatic moment or two there was nothing even remotely funny about Sunshine State. In fact, you're so disappointed in the film that if there were a humorous moment you wouldn't even feel like laughing. The film makers really did forget to have something happen in this movie. There is no action, no comedy, no art, NO PLOT, just a bland look at ordinary people doing ordinary things in Florida. The most exciting part of the whole movie featured an alligator sitting in a pen...doing nothing. Seriously, you will overdose on bordom if you watch this film. If you have trouble sleeping at night, just watch 15 minutes of this movie....start it from the end if you like (it won't matter). I friend of mine watched this film in a class because it had simularities to ""The Grapes of Wrath"". He said within 15 minutes half the class was asleep and the other half was wondering about the hallways to escape from this monstrosity of a movie. He even had this to say about Sunshine State: ""Every hair on my head was growing in the direction of the exit's welcoming glow"". Even the cast from Mystery Science Theater 3000 wouldn't know where to begin making fun of this train wreck. Actually, I am offended this movie was made in my home state. A word to the wise: AVOID SUNSHINE STATE AT ALL COSTS!

1783692,3,B00006L926,"This is a relatively plot free movie that is essentially a characters study. In some ways it resembles two other movies of this type: Wilby Wonderful, and The June Bug. In fact Sunshine State and Wilby Wonderful both have a character who wanders through the movie trying to find a way to kill himself. Two threads that run through this story are a town's annual celebration, and the coming of land developers. These are not dominant plot elements, however, rather they seem to flow along under the surface, and break through at odd moments during the film. So we are left mostly to meeting and learning about several of the town's inhabitants. The difficulty in such a movie is to create interesting people who are not just stereotypes.

Edie Falco, as the woman who manages a motel and restaurant for her almost blind father, does extremely well. You catch her frustration in being burdened with a job that she doesn't want. She is an intelligent person who had wanted to be an oceanographer. Her father, who has a small part, is interesting as a man who struggles with his conservative and sometimes racist views in a changing world. Other inhabitants of Sunshine State border on the ordinary. While they provide us with modest interest, scenes often linger too long on them. Other folks who might be interesting are left in the shadows.

All in all I found this movie to be less satisfying than the other two films that I mentioned above: Wilby Wonderful, and The June Bug. The June Bug is an outstanding movie. Could I persuade you to watch those two instead of this one?",1175904000,,1575,4.682310469314079
1783693,5,B00006L926,"Sayles produces an ensemble film with lots of characters moving emotionally, and some staying in place.  As with many of Sayles's films, it has a mixed-race cast, something I don't see in many films; he makes a point of discussing ethnicity and identity in many ways.  The acting is good, based on Sayles's good script.  There are a couple character types from classical theater, like the seer (the doctor), and the Greek chorus (the 4 golfers), that I really appreciated.  With interludes of these larger-than-life characters, the movie is more than plot- or entertainment-driven.  I also found a lot of suspense in the movie, with questions as simple as ""Can we go in here?"" or ""I'm glad you're here, I've been wanting to talk with you"" making me wonder where a scene would lead because the characters don't know where it will go.

There are 2 major plots surrounding 2 excellent actors, the beautiful and angry Angela Bassett and the pretty but sad Edie Falco.  Desiree (Bassett) appears to be condemned by old friends and her own mom as a teenage runaway returning almost impossibly late to reconnect, when in fact her parents sent her away.  Hers is a strong story of the possibility of recovering some good feelings about her childhood home now that she is in a loving marriage with a really mellow guy (James McDaniel - excellent in this film).

The seer talks about history and the vitality of Lincoln Beach (in the movie), a beachfront neighborhood based on and filmed in the real American Beach, which was a resort founded by a black-owned insurance company for its employees during segregation.  Sayles's commentary on the DVD covers a lot of historical detail, but there's enough in the movie to be intriguing and provocative.  In this context of aging home owners whose kids have moved elsewhere, we meet what you might call a ""face man"" for development in Lincoln Beach that is a foil of the development happening overtly in the historically white neighborhood next door, in Delrona Beach.  Alex Lewis gives a nuanced performance; he is really good.

I found the movie to be visually interesting, for example with the Greek chorus of golfers.  Their movements are mundane, yet at times like a dance around the gesturing perorations of Alan King.  In his commentary, Sayles talks about how closely he story-boarded much of the film to make economical use of the actors' time; I wonder if this helps explain how carefully positioned the actors were relative to each other and how good the lighting was, throughout the film.

I thought Terrell, the young cousin who lives with Desiree's mom, was a key character in the film, as an ensemble film, very believable in his character, and a good actor.  Given how closed off he was for most of the film, he did a really good job relaxing a little with Desiree's husband, and he's perfect when they part.

I think the film did a good job showing the complicated affection people feel about their childhood homes, their aging parents, and perhaps their duty to a place as well as to people.  Well, there's always a lot to say about a Sayles film, but I won't drone on.  I loved it.",1137715200,7,3135,4.738489871086556
1783725,4,B00006L926,"This is an excellent film in many ways.  The acting is particularly impressive (check out Edie Falco and Mary Steenburgen). There are five stories going at once, and they are treated with delicacy and depth.  The pace is brisk and the script is tight.  The plot is described in other reviews.

The movie is marred by Sayles's usual leftist preaching style.  All of the corporation executives are evil, town officials are corrupt and rude, all of the blacks are good (two hold doctorates), and there are some strong and at times muddled statements about civil rights.  Preaching aside, there is  a melodramatic aspect to the film that may turn off some viewers.  The golfer scenes with Alan King defy explanation, although they are mildly amusing.

Still, on the whole, this is a first-rate film that deserves a lot of attention.  It gives one hope for modern films.",1128729600,3,865,4.8231292517006805
1783726,5,B00006L926,"This film depicts a small Florida town, Delrona Beach, that's being targeted for a new resort by land developers. The story revolves around a cast of characters and how their lives will potentially be changed, for better or worse, by the transformation of their hometown. One of the major characters is Marly (Edie Falco), a woman who longs to free herself from the obligations imposed by her father while finding love and life somewhere new. Another is Desiree (Angela Bassett), who has returned to confront her painful past and try to create a new and more understanding relationship with her mother. Many other stories also unfold, with charm and humor, as the movie winds towards a resolution.

Some people may find this film rather slow. But personally I loved the deep and funny exploration of its many eccentric characters. Also the movie's gentle pace made it seem more realistic and true to life than the many mindless Hollywood flicks that we are constantly exposed to. Great movie!",1123372800,3,992,4.940119760479042
1783727,5,B00006L926,"No film director has earned more the right to make a movie about not selling out than has John Sayles. Over the years he has consistently directed fine independent movies. I thus expected much from this movie and was not disappointed.
 The out-of-state developers have descended on Delrona Beach and Lincon Beach, Florida. They want to bring progress in the form of ""plantations,"" planned resorts, golf courses, etc. If you are interested in how timely this subject is, spend a day driving down A-1A in Florida. Then there's Disney World in the middle of the state. You'll be interested to see just who the bad guys are and what color some of them are.
The ensemble cast is outstanding, from Angela Bassett-- when she's on the screen, all eyes are on her-- to Edie Falco, Timothy Hutton, Mary Steenburgen--""it's so difficult to create a tradition""--to Jane Alexander and Gordon Clapp. There is a delicious scene where Alexander outsmarts a developer who is trying to rook her out of her property. She says something to the effect that she's good at finance since she has run a nonprofit theatre group for 25 years. A word about Falco: you totally forget that she is a big part of ""The Sopranos."" It's good to know that there is life for her outside that show. She's completely believable as the tired manager of her father's restaurant and motel. Finally, it's worth what you paid to rent or buy this video to hear the young woman sing ""The Last Mile of the Way.""",1076284800,5,1463,4.670542635658915

All the interlocking stories of the potentially wealthy residents are entertaining and amusing but the film really belongs to Angela Bassett and James McDaniel as a woman returning to her home town with her husband, half-heartedly willing to confront unresolved family affairs and relationships. They provide a strong backbone to this gentle and funny film.",1066348800,,619,5.526315789473684
1783729,3,B00006L926,"John Sayles returns to his Altmanesque ""Lone Star"" formula, with mixed results. Instead of a small town in Texas, a sleepy little resort community in Florida is put under the microscope. Once again, Sayles juggles about a half-dozen subplots that eventually tie together, although in a somewhat less compelling fashion than his Texas tale. The now-familiar Sayles themes of family ties, bittersweet love stories, culture clash and community traditions are trotted out and examined. The film opens strong, with greedy land developers descending on quirky small-town landowners, initially leading the viewer to think they are headed for a picaresque Carl Hiaasen-flavored social satire. Instead, we are given a deliberately paced, almost Mike Leigh (""Secrets and Lies"")-style glimpse into the lives of several families. The various little epiphanies that result are, at best, only a little interesting. Sayles is an actor's director, and while that usually guarantees good performances (which this film does have), it doesn't necessarily guarantee a riveting story. In fact, there are so many good actors in the huge cast (Edie Falco, Tim Hutton, Angela Bassett, Ralph Waite, Jane Alexander, Mary Steenburgen, etc.) that it's almost distracting, since no one stays on screen for very long at any given time. Worth a look, and more intelligent than 95% of the current Hollywood offal, but not quite gripping enough to compare to Sayles' best work.",1063152000,3,1444,5.393805309734513
1783730,5,B00006L926,"There are so many elements going on in this movie, it's hard to focus on which ones stand out the most.
First and foremost, as a Florida resident for 25 years, he nails the sleepy ocean-front atmosphere.  The characters in relation to the land, their struggles with local government and big-time developers are utterly believable and accurately portrayed.  The sense of community is delivered admirably with looks into the lives of a wide-range of citizens.
The characters are (for the most part) subtly woven together, no matter how disparate they initially appear.  Marly, portrayed by Edie Falco, is my favorite.  She's a not-quite-bitter-divorcee who has taken over the family's restaraunt/hotel business.  A former Wikki Wachi (sp?) mermaid, this is *not* what she wants to do with her life.  But because nothing better has come along, she stays and keeps her father happy.
Rather than one main plot, there are several sub-plots throughout the film.  Desiree (Angela Bassett) reconciling herself with her mother and her past.  Marly deciding what she wants and what she doesn't want.  Exley (sp?) Plantation trying to buy out the town.  Dr. Lloyd trying desperately to save the town.  Mrs. Stokes wanting to save Terrell, or, at the least, redeem him. Jack just doing his job.  Francine running the annual Buckaneer Day.  Delia Temple making the best of her situation.  Earl trying to kill himself.  And the Florida Flash, whom no one really knows what it is he's doing back in town.  All of this tied up neatly with four golfers, musing on the nature of the land.
It's a glorious movie.  I've watched it four times already, and plan to watch it many more.",1056412800,6,1661,4.91726618705036
1783731,4,B00006L926,"Set in Florida, this somewhat offbeat film was directed by John Sayles.  At first it seems like another one of those ""big business versus the little guy"" films because the central theme is about a land developer wanting to buy the homes and businesses of the local population.  Also, as one section of the beach is where aspiring black families built their homes years before, it seems like it might have a racial theme.  But times have changed, and so have the movies.  There's more to this story than age-old conflicts.  There are the real issues about dreams of parents not necessarily being the dreams of the children.
For example, take Edie Falco, cast as the daughter of a motel owner.  Her father is half blind and aging; her mother, Jane Alexander, is a flaky drama teacher who turns out to be quite an astute businesswoman.  Edie has had a failed marriage, hates the motel and would like to sell out.  She's tired of her life in which her most cherished success was working as a swimming mermaid in a tank in a restaurant.  ""The important thing was to keep a smile on your face, even while you're drowning,"" she says to Tim Hutton, an architect for the development, who dreams of creating beautiful landscapes.
Then there's Angela Basset and her husband James McDaniel.  She's been away for 25 years because her mother, Eunice Stokes, sent her away when she was 15.  This trip home opens old wounds, as the former football star who made her pregnant is now an unsuccessful car salesman who is exploiting his heritage to make buck.  There's also a young troubled cousin who she tries to help.
In the meantime, the town is having a pageant and Mary Steenburger is in charge.  And Alan King and a couple of cronies appear from time to time playing golf and making jokes.  There's even a work gang of white rednecks who work side by side with a Seminole Indian who knows how to talk back to them.  There's a lot going on in the film.  Some of it quite subliminal.
The acting was uniformly good, but not outstanding.  Mostly, because there were so many characters that no one particularly stood out.  The writing was good enough to keep the plot moving and I wasn't confused about their complex relationships at any time. The best parts of the film though were the clever lines, which were constant and added a little ""ting"" to the story.  The film was 141 minutes long, and even though I wasn't bored, I would have liked to push it along during the slow parts.  And some of it was a little too low key for my taste because I tend to like more high drama and action.
Sunshine State is modern, witty and allegorical.  I found it pleasant to watch I do recommend it.",1046563200,5,2668,4.505197505197505

1783733,5,B00006L926,"This is so much more than a movie about real-estate developers moving into a sleepy coastal community in Florida, despite how it appears at the beginning. It is about the lives and dreams of those who live there; about those who have left and returned; and those who have never left, but want to. It is about dreams: dreams of individuals and dreams held by parents for their children. ""Sunshine State"" has a unique perspective.
Sayles examines each of his characters with great affection, it seems. No one is all-good or all-bad.....there is a lot of ""middle of the road"" here, mostly decent people. He lovingly develops his characters slowly and thoughtfully, and never judges these folks, no matter what they decide to do or not do.
The slow, but never boring, pace of this movie allows the viewer to get involved in the lives of its characters, all of whom are played to perfection by fairly high-profile actors (Angela Bassett, Edir Falco, Timothy Hutton, Mary Steenburgen, and Alan King, among others). The narrative is told in ovelapping stories with an intersection of most of its characters as conflicts unfold in the community.

1783734,4,B00006L926,"John Sayles, who wrote, directed, and edited Sunshine State, is one of the finest directors working today. He is able to take seemingly unrelated stories and create a wonderful film. His work, including Limbo, Eight Men Out, Lone Star, and Matewan are all movies that make you think. I would have liked more extras on this DVD, but Sayles commentary is interesting and does provide some insight into the movie making process. The movie, about developers moving into a little town in Florida and the effect on the town, looks at class and race differences and provides a different look at Florida, much like Limbo did for Alaska. The cast is really good, led by Edie Falco, who provides a Oscar worthy performance as a ""motelier"" who wants more out of life but doesn't seem to want it enough to leave, and by Angela Bassett, who did leave and maybe is wondering what she got of life by leaving. Bill Cobbs and TYimothy Hutton also provide solid performances in this movie. As I indictaed, the lack of extras is disappointing, but the movie itself is a gem. John Sayles, whose body of work stands with any director working today, has produced another film that will leave you thinking about it long after you view it.",1038009600,18,1215,4.655813953488372

7971031,3,B00006L926,"Great cast but incredibly low  budget film. Poor transitions and moves a little slow. However, the story is based on the history of development in Fernandina Beach (which is renamed in the movie) and American Beach (also renamed). The film was actually done here on the island so, as an Islander, I found it interesting and somewhat entertaining. There is a message there about overdevelopment and how much of society and history can be destroyed by greed.",1464912000,4,456,4.922077922077922
