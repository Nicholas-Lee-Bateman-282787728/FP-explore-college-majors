8380406,2,B002TOL4D2,"Based on the huge box-office success of Al Jolson's second movie ""The Singing Fool,"" (it held the box-office record for highest grosser for 11 years, until Gone With The Wind in 1939), the brothers Warner apparently decided to go for the full gusto in ""Say It With Songs."" Now bear in mind that in 1929, the ""silent melodrama"" was still how movie-goers envisioned a Hollywood feature drama. As did the Studios. So they clearly set out to make ""Say It With Songs"" the biggest tearjerker of all time. The movie also borrowed key elements from ""The Singing Fool,"" in particular the father/son relationship between Jolson and the adorable Davy Lee ... including a ""Sonny Boy"" type of song, ""Little Pal."" Unfortunately most off the other original songs in ""Say It With Songs"" were very forgettable.

It is quite clear that the makers were attempting to create a 'masterpiece' of the 'new sound cinema'. Some scenes would run long at the tail-end in order immerse the audience in the sense of drama --- the best example being the long sequence showing the prisoners going to their cells. There was a small sense of an attempt at 'movie art.'

The movie was ALL talking ... one of the first major movies to take that gamble. In ""Say It With Songs"" they pulled out ALL the stops; with Jolson singing and making wisecracks --- but also doing very, very heavily scripted melodrama. The singing along with the wisecracks probably gives us one of the best examples of the 'real' Jolson style --- however the melodrama fails badly ... very badly. Jolson was a Broadway star, but not because of his ability to perform deep melodrama. He was a singer, dancer, comedian, and he was electric onstage in a way that not a single Jolson movie ever captured, (he was in approximately a dozen films).

Also recall that ""The Singing Fool"" had been a hybrid, alternating between being a silent and a talkie, so that ""silent melodrama""scenes  still worked in that film. If ""Say It With Songs"" had been a 100% silent film, Jolson might have pulled it off with such melodrama. Clearly the writers, the director Lloyd Bacon, and Jolson himself, didn't realize that such overly-heavy melodrama used in the 'silents' wouldn't work in the talkies, (high melodrama had worked in ""The Jazz Singer,"" but that movie was essentially a 'silent' with songs). Had they kept Jolson's tearful scenes shorter and with a smaller performance, it might have worked out. Or if it had been a hybrid silent and talkie, like ""The Singing Fool,"" maybe it would have been another hit. Or  if the movie had just been edited around the scripted melodrama, it would have been more viewable. Add a couple of more really good songs with a better Jolson-savvy script, and who knows what might have happened? And while they were clearly trying to break the expectation of  Jolson's song-and-dance style in this movie, it was probably a mistake to wait so long into the film to have Jolson sing ---  that's what the audience is there for.

Although it was actually good to see a Jolson movie with no blackface, it might have been wiser to write a movie more uplifting throughout to accommodate the Jolson style. And so I think the need to create a 'masterpiece' backfired. Although the movie is tedious (even painful) to view, there are some elements that were creative for 1929, especially the scene in which Davey Lee dreams that Jolson is with him singing ""Little Pal."" So Jolson fans will find elements that are definitely worth experiencing, especially that final ""Little Pal"" sequence. And movie is certainly of historical value, as the movie industry probably learned a thing or two about writing 'drama' for the ""talkies."" The movie is now available on DVD-R at Amazon.",1387065600,2,3718,4.789391575663027
8380407,3,B002TOL4D2,"This film can be described as a melodrama with songs, not fully realized as melodrama because of Al Jolson's occasional bad acting; not as a musical as there are not enough tunes to make up a ""soundtrack album"", although we know that genre was decades away.

For the Jolson fan, this is a find of a lifetime (it appears that it was unavailable for eons). For the casual fan, or individual who just loves old songs, it's also valuable, as AJ performs all songs *live* on the sound stage. When he's doing his thing, he's brilliant (obvious respectful ""copyists"" come to mind, and no slouches among them: Crosby, Sinatra, Danny Thomas, Danny Lewis [Jerry's Dad], Jackie Wilson, Jerry Lee Lewis, Tom Jones....). There is no ""Minstrel Show"" theatrics, no ""Blackface"", and this aspect of his career has not traveled well through the decades; it's been reported that Jolson was no racist - was somehat a product of the times, in this regard.

The dragged out story of an ex-prizefighter, impulsive and immature, who marries a Nurse on hand to rehabilitate him after a fight, has some holes and some pacing issues (as his first all-talking, sound-striped film, we can expect less than ""tight"" editing. Also, in 1929, movies had not completely outgrown the silent film need to exaggerate). We see the return of the very young Davy Lee - he was ""Sonny Boy"" in the hugely successful second Jolson movie, ""The Singing Fool""; now he's ""Little Pal"", also the unofficial theme song of this effort - would not have made a bad movie title.

Joe Lane knocks down a potential filanderer, actually his new boss who has given him a chance to be a radio and records star - I'm no ""spoiler"", see this DVD.",1310083200,,1682,4.694915254237288
8380408,1,B002TOL4D2,"I love Al Jolson's work, so this one would fall under the heading of 'for hardcore fans only'. The title is misleading as there really aren't that many songs! Al's performance in this film is unrestrainedly hardcore hambone bad (watch for his staring right into the camera) - and not in the fun way either. The divine Marian Nixon as the long suffering wife helps A LOT to bring up the quality level of a seriously turgid story about a gambling addict/performer who seems to get too many chances to make things right, though that's just my opinion! And the child actor playing the baby is nothing short of remarkable - be sure you really don't have anything better to do when you pop this one in the dvd player.",1308009600,2,711,4.476923076923077
8380409,3,B002TOL4D2,"This was my first time to view this film, having only heard about it by reading the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Song-in-the-Dark-The-Birth-of-the-Musical-Film/dp/0195377346/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film</a>, which painted a totally unflattering portrait of this film, to say the very least. This film is not as bad as you would gather by reading other reviews on the subject. In the first place, Al Jolson was a great entertainer, but he never was a great actor. Also, you have to understand that Jolson's films were mainly just made as vehicles for audiences to see and hear what Al Jolson did best - sing his heart out. His films were never meant to be competiton with ""All Quiet on the Western Front"".

The problem here is that this film is obviously recycling parts of ""The Singing Fool"" - primarily the big love Jolson's character has for his little son, again played by Davie Lee. Jolson plays an ex prize fighter now a radio star married to a devoted wife who is losing patience with Al's continued love for gambling. At the same time, the manager of the radio station where Al works is infatuated with Al's wife and puts the moves on her. Of course Al's wife tells him what happened, Al confronts the guy, and then lands an all-too effective punch that ends in Al going to prison for manslaughter.

The plot is thin even for 1929, but as over-the-top as Jolson's acting style could be in these early films, he is still much more natural before the camera than many other full-fledged movie actors of the time. That and the fact that it is always a pleasure to hear and see Jolson sing makes this worth watching. I only wish that the songs could have been a bit more memorable. Only ""Seventh Heaven"" really sticks with you. Also note that this is one of very few Warner Brothers films that still survive from 1929. I think there are only seven in all that are still with us in their entirety.

This is a Warner Archive product. It is a DVD-R with no extras and no chapter stops. You can only go forward and backwards in ten minute increments. The video and audio quality on this film are quite good. There are very few video artifacts and the audio comes through quite clearly. My recommendation would be that this is a definite buy if you are a Jolson fan - I am. If you are not, then you probably won't enjoy it at all.

Also note that Warner Brothers has bundled six of Jolson's films together on DVD-R into a value pack for a total of sixty dollars if you buy directly from them. The films are:
1. The Singing Fool (1928) (Part talking)
2. Say It With Songs (1929)
3. Big Boy (1930)
4. Wonder Bar (1934)
5. Go Into Your Dance (1935)
6. The Singing Kid (1936)
The Jazz Singer is already on pressed DVD in the excellent set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jazz-Singer-Three-Disc-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00005JKSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jazz Singer (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a>.",1256947200,12,3040,4.931640625
