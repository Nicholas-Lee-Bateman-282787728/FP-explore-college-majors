2626223,5,B000H4JH4O,"""Keeping Up with the Steins"": As a Gentile, I'm not privy to things such as Passover celebrations at home or Bar or Bat Mitzvahs.  One of the beauties of the movies is giving viewers a peek at worlds and times they may not otherwise see.  Keeping Up with the Steins is a funny, touching, sweet movie about a preteen boy, his competitive father, and estranged grandfather.

Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) and his parents Adam and Joanne (Jeremy Piven, Jami Gertz), who live in Brentwood, CA, attend an over-the-top Titanic-themed Bar Mitzvah given by Arnie Stein (Larry Miller) for his son.  Adam, a Hollywood agent, determined to ""blow away the Steins"", hires an event planner to plan a blockbuster event held at Dodger Stadium.  Benjamin, overwhelmed and confused over what a Bar Mitzvah means anyway, decides to deflate his father's bluster by secretly inviting Adam's father Irwin (Garry Marshall), who left Adam's mother Rose (Doris Roberts) decades ago.  Irwin arrives in his RV with his free-spirited girlfriend Sacred Feather (Darryl Hannah), two weeks early according to Benjamin's doctored invitation.  Adam complains, ""My driveway has become a trailer park!""

This film boasts of a good roster of supporting character actors, including Marshall, Roberts, Miller, and Richard Benjamin as the rabbi.  The man portraying the Bar/Bat Mitzvah teacher was as cute as all out.  Although this movie surely wasn't intended as a primer for Bar Mitvahs, the film shows scenes of the class, as well as Irwin's attempts to deepen Benjamin's understanding of the ceremony.  I wish the film had explored the religious and spiritual questions even further, but this isn't The Chosen.

I don't think this film overindulges in Jewish stereotypes, though that's not for me to say.  You do get more than one glimpse of Marshall's bare toukus while he's swimming, and you also get some thoughts about materialism, family responsibility, and spirituality, as Benjamin starts to discover and assert his budding adulthood.  I recommend this film as PG-13-level family entertainment.",1149206400,26,2069,5.2303030303030305

2626317,5,B000H4JH4O,"This is absolutely one of my favorite coming-of-age films, right on the top of my list with Ferris Buehler's Day Off. I grew up in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood near Chicago where most of my friends were Members of the Tribe and I was honorary. I love this kind of humor and most of all, humor that conveys an important message, in this case, what maturing is all about. The stellar cast is irresistible (Jeremy Piven and Garry Marshall for starters), and many of the jokes are laugh-out-loud. The beauty is that the film turns on its ear who are the real ""adults"" and gives everyone who experiences Benji's bar mitzvah a chance to make that passage into manhood again for themselves, especially his dad and grandpa. Lastly, it certainly puts into perspective the ridiculous human practice of trying to one-up your neighbor.",1444176000,2,830,4.811188811188811

2626320,3,B000H4JH4O,"Being Jewish, I have a bias towards liking a film like this. The usage of Yiddish, along with the many exaggerations of the Jewish family are something most people won't understand, unless they grew up around it. Parts of this film I found to be hysterical, while my non-Jewish friend, sitting next to me, didn't get it at all. As for the film, it's a lie before the credits even stop rolling. Keeping Up With The Steins, really has very little to due with the Stein family, as they are part of the background story at best. The film is actually about a broken family, forced together on the eve of a child's Bar Mitzvah. Benjamin Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) is turning 13, which in the Jewish religion means that he is about to become a man. His parents are well off and are making huge plans for the event, but Ben wants no part of it. In an attempt to take the attention off himself, he sends an invitation to his estranged Grandfather that he's never met, a Grandfather, who shows up to the families wealthy neighborhood in an old RV, with a woman half his age. This is where the heart of the story comes from, as father and son are forced together after fifteen years. Jeremy Piven stars as the son and believe it or not he's a big time Hollywood agent, living in a life of luxury. This toned down version of Ari is forced to see his father, played by the legendary Garry Marshall. For the past 15 years, he's been living as a hippie,  teaching on an Indian reservation. As soon as they see each other the two are at odds and it really is very funny. The star of the film is Spy Kids, Daryl Sabara, who I have never liked. He's just always so shy and painfully awkward, I really just don't understand his appeal. While he is a major part of the story, the parts of the film that feature him without Marshall or Piven are just painful. Keeping Up With The Steins isn't raunchy and much of the humor is intertwined in the Jewish religion. If you're not Jewish, you'll probably have the same reaction my friend did. Personally I loved it, but I can understand how this film won't appeal to everybody.",1413158400,,2097,4.349489795918367

2626348,5,B000H4JH4O,"Other reviewers have spoken about such things as the plot in this movie, and the ""competitive"" aspects of two Bar Mitzvahs. Instead of repeating other reviewers, I primarily focus on more abstract matters. This comedy seems to capture the essence of the community-centered and culture-centered aspects of Jewish religious activities and rites of passage.

Imagine being a 13 year-old Jewish-American boy. Your rabbi, during the preparation for your Bar Mitzvah, teaches you things in a way that you do not fully understand. You have to learn difficult Hebrew letters. When told by your rabbi that, from now on, the sins you commit will not be laid on the parents, but will be your own, you do not feel so great. Yet you must become a man.

For one boy, the celebration he gets was extravagant. Another boy's was not so much. Still, his community came together big time. The HAVA NAGILA was sung. Benjamin was the center of attention. It was his moment of honor.",1358985600,3,961,4.818181818181818

The kids raid the liquor cabinet in 1 scene.  Jeremy Piven (Ellen, Entourage), Doris Roberts (Everybody Loves Raymond) & Garry Marshall (Murphy Brown, Lost In America, Lavern & Shirley) lead an ensemble cast including Daryl Hannah & Larry Miller.  Jewish boy coming of age in Hollywood thru the family rift between father & grandfather caused by the grandparents divorce/separation/abandonment 20 years prior. It doesn't sound humerous, but almost every scene is funny and well done.  Sidebar, satirical social commentary on current american pop culture.  Thinking about it, I'd say funny in about the same way as Everybody Loves Raymond, Ellen, Murphy Brown & Lavern & Shirley.  You're bound to love or hate the character each actor creates.

This is a good heart-warming movie for the whole family.  Some viewers may not be able to relate to the theme of a young man's Bar Mitzvah, but this is only the vehicle used to carry the story, and it makes for good comedy.  I loved the scene where the young man is looking into the mirror, trying to reassure himself by repeating ""Today I am a man. Today I am a man"", and then brushing his teeth with a Sponge Bob tooth brush.  Not exactly great theater, but great fun and lots of moments that make you laugh and smile.

2626372,5,B000H4JH4O,"As someone who entertains at Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, this movie is hysterical.  It isn't really factual in many areas, but just a funny ride for those that are looking for a light comedy.",1202860800,,181,4.65625
2626373,4,B000H4JH4O,"""Keeping Up With the Steins"" is an amiable and very funny film comedy, which will bring back memories for anyone, who has gone through the Bar Mitzvah experience. For anyone who dosn't know, this is a Jewish coming-of-age ceremony in which a 13 year old, Jewish male, publicly reads from the Torah and is initiated into the religious community as an adult. It is traditional, that a ""feast"" or party usually follows in celebration of this accomplishment.

The movie is a very funny look at a dysfunctional Jewish family and one Bar Mitzvah boy's search for the true meaning of the ceremony, that he's about to partake in. In the film teenager, Ben Fiedler (Daryl Sabara) and his family attend the ridiculously ostentatious, ""Titanic"" movie themed, Bar Mitzvah party  (""I'm king of the Haftorah!!"") put on by the Steins. In a fit of envy Ben's father, Adam Fiedler (Jeremy Piven) a wealthy, Hollywood agent, starts making plans to rent out Dodger Stadium and hiring Neil Diamond to sing. All this attention, planning and fuss seems to make young Ben squirm with embarassment. He dosn't seem to really understand any of this. In hopes of stopping (or at least slowing down) his father's crazy plans, Ben secretely invites his Grandfather Irving (Garry Marshall), who has for years been estranged from the family. Irving, an eccentric character, shows up on the family doorstep (with a hippie girlfriend in tow) and starts to work his way into the family's life. More importantly he forms a bond with Ben and starts to nudge the young man into the direction of becoming his own man and finding out the true meaning of becoming Bar Mitzvah.

Director, Scott Marshall has created a really hilarious and sweet movie. This film could have very easily degenerated into nothing but stereotypes and gross caricatures. Instead Mark Zakirin's script presents a very funny, but touching look at a family, that has its problems. The parents really do care about their kid. The kid really is trying to understand, what all the fuss is about. This is a step above the usual dreck, when Hollywood tries to make film comedies about families.

The cast to this film is all around great. Daryl Sabara does an good job of protraying the befuddled feelings of a normal thirteen year old. Likewise, Jeremy Piven is over the top and great as the Hollywood agent/father. This isn't much of a stretch for him, since he's basically playing a sweetened version of his hilarious agent character, Ari Gold (found on the HBO series ""Entourage""). Gary Marshall as the grandfather is basically doing the same shtick (yelling, screaming, sarcasm) he does in all his acting roles. Normally I'm not a big fan of his, but in this case, the character and his mannerisms actually work well. Finally kudos should go to Jamie Gertz as the understanding mom, Doris Roberts (of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" fame) as the grandma and Daryl Hannah in an interesting turn as Grandpa Irving's hippie girlfriend. A wonderful cast and an smart, funny script make this an excellent movie! Highly recommended!",1199664000,,3053,4.899419729206963
2626374,4,B000H4JH4O,"As a parent who is in the midst of planning a bat mitzvah and frustraited with those who plan gala extravaganzas this was a perfect movie for us.

Kudos to the director for putting in his dad (Gary Marshall) as the grand dad.  He was wonderful and this movie touched everyone in my brood.

2626375,5,B000H4JH4O,"As a fan of the spy kids movies because of Daryl Sabara's dead on performance as a fun loving boy who just happened to also be a spy, I felt I owed it to Daryl to see Keeping up With the Steins. This movie went so far beyond my expectations it was unbelievable. It oozed of indie doings rather than the ridiculously adolescent Hollywood humor and is by far the best coming of age comedy drama since Saint Ralph. Daryl is perfect as a boy on the road to confusing times of bar mitzvahs and expected manhood at 13 when he hasn't even reached his own self imposed milestone of being 5 feet tall by the time of the opening phrase of the bar mitzvah ceremony is uttered by the rabbi. He finds that maturity has a whole lot more to do with accepting life's unimportant and insignificant limitations than trying to rebel against them. He also learns that the most important thing is family and not trying to artificially be any better than what you really are. The rest of the cast is exceptional, in particular Jeremy Piven as the 'best bar mitzvah at any cost' dad, Garry marshall as the wisecracking hippie grandpa and Larry Miller as the 'Stein' to keep up with. The laughs are unstoppable and the story is a wonder to watch unfold. My only wish is that there were more for Doris Roberts to do in the movie.

2626376,4,B000H4JH4O,"I stumbled on to this movie and it is a very good one.  In many ways it is like an inside joke as it protrays the Jewish Culture but the story and messages are really broader than that.  It borders on satire as it shows Beverly Hills/Brentwood in Calif with all of the joggers, pretension, and trivial value system that is so prevalent there, but beneath this veneer is a heart warming and rather realistic story of a family.  It vividly demonstrates that money can buy anything but something of value and the most valuable thing is family.  He shows that marriages are complex things and only those two in the marriage really understand it and those on the outside shouldn't make judgements regarding someone else's marriage.  This was a story of regrets, mistakes, and foregiveness and shows it is never too late to say ""I'm sorry"".  The interplay between the grandparents was marvelous and could have added a great deal more to the movie had it been expanded.  The son's inability to forgive was very believable and even his grudging acceptance at the end was believable. This was a marvelous movie that delivered several very good messages with a light and humorous touch.  Very well done and if you are looking for a good family movie this is one.  It has a couple of brief tushy shots but nothing to keep it from family viewing.",1175731200,5,1334,4.61864406779661
2626377,5,B000H4JH4O,"At first, this appears to be a movie about a family who wants to outdo another Jewish family by having an even more extravagant bar mitzvah party for their son Benjamin.

But when Benjamin secretly invites his estranged hippie grandfather to the bar mitzvah two weeks early, things take an interesting turn. Over the course of the film, Benjamin develops a bond with his grandfather and begins to understand the true meanings of bar mitzvah and manhood and maturity.

So does Benjamin's father. He learns that becoming a Bar Mitzvah (son of the commandment) is not about having a huge party and outdoing the Steins, it's about becoming emotionally and spiritually mature, something that finally begins to happen to him at his own son's bar mitzvah. In a way, the father also becomes a son of the commandment at the same time his son does.

This is one of the better movies I've seen in a while, much more good natured and heartwarming than most Hollywood offerings.",1170288000,8,965,4.766467065868263

I thought I knew what to expect (I thought it would be like a My Big Fat Greek Wedding type movie with all the cultural trimmings), but it was different to that.  It's a nice family movie with a fantastic cast (I especially love Jeremy Piven).

The first scene involves a wealthy family celebrating their sons Bar Mitzvah with a Titanic theme and a titanic expenditure to match.  Now the Fiedler family feels they have to live up to the same hype.  It's a cute story line about family coming together and not always getting along but it obviously works out well in the end as you'd expect.

I really liked this - I think it's a movie that people of all faiths can enjoy.  It's got some great moments in it and some good laughs too.  Look out at the end for a surprise performance from an amazing famous Jewish male singer staring as himself.  I love it and hope you do too.",1165104000,11,922,4.252873563218391

2626381,4,B000H4JH4O,"Are there people who actually spend hundreds of thousands on Bar Mitzvahs?  In the Brentwood community of ""Keeping Up with The Steins"", the answer is ""ofcourse"", and the movie kicks off with with a Bar Mitzvah set on a cruise ship and based on ""Titanic"" (the event and the movie - ""I'm the King of the Torah!!"" exults the Bar Mitzvah boy).  The Stein's aren't the heroes of this story - rather they are never-present foils of the Fiedlers.  Denizens of Brentwood, where everybody seems to work for celebrities and earns more money than anybody knows what to do with, the Fiedlers face their son's approaching Bar Mitzvah with a mixture of anticipation and dread - how are they going to outdo the Steins?  Adam, Benji Fiedler's father (Jeremy Piven, playing a patriarchal version of the character he plays on ""Entourage"") needs little prodding before Dodger Stadium becomes the Bar Mitzvah's chosen venue.  Once a partner with Stein and now a bitter competitor, Adam is determined to leave nothing to chance.  The ""nothing"", we later learn, is his own horrid past - his father (Garry Marshall) was a jovial guy too full of life to stick around and actually be a family man.  Years after abandoning his family, Adam's father lives out in the desert with his younger and hyper-new-agey wife ""Sacred Feather"" (Darryl Hannah).  Frantic preparations for his Bar Mitzvah inform Benjamin Fiedler's dread -he can't ""chant"" his Haftorah to save his life (and if you don't know what a Haftorah is, don't worry - the point of the story is that Benjamin knows about as much), he moons over the beautiful Ashley, hopes his father will patch things up with his grandfather, and hopes that maybe he can become a man without the need to outdo the fearsome Stein's.

""Steins"" is a small if innocuous gem - a small movie with a lot of familiar faces.  It looks like that kind of movie that people make to unwind while making bigger and more trying movies, and the cast looks like they had about as much fun making the movie as I did watching it.  There are small but nuanced performances, and the cast gets through the plots small but myriad challenges.  The story never congeals - the hated Steins are almost non-entities in a movie that bares their name.  But the script won't require much effort to keep up with its in-Jewish jokes (like the difference between ""Nachos"" & ""Nachas"").  The basic point of the story (that some of these celebrations are so overdone that those involved lose sight of what they're celebrating) isn't too heavily delivered, and if there aren't any real jokes, the understated performances are guaranteed to keep a smile on your face - like Benji's grandmother, the story gets its point across without having to openly speak its mind.  If you need a rest from exploding cars and devilish fashion editors, drop by The Steins.",1151884800,12,2834,4.743380855397149
2626382,2,B000H4JH4O,"This movie was enjoyable at times, but without Daryl Hannah's comic relief, it wouldn't have been halfway decent.  The fact that there needs to be comic relief in a comedy certainly says something about the film...I also agree with the reviews in that the grandfather character takes over the film, resulting in way too many ""jokes"" that aren't funny at all. However, if you're coming to see Daryl Hannah, I suggest this film 100% because she is just hilarious.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.",1150329600,4,497,4.904761904761905

8136242,5,B000H4JH4O,"Oh, this is hilarious! My son's Bar Mitzvah will occur in 4 years, so it's quite relevant. I've already attended several at our Temple, and there's been one that was amazing but a bit over-the-top. Admittedly, it was Not quite as over-the-top as the Steins', but enough to have other parents of our b'nei mitzvah to be concerned. It is a fun film with a great cast: Jeremy Piven, Garry Marshall, Darryl Hannah, etc. Enjoy!",1493251200,2,422,4.64

8136248,5,B000H4JH4O,"Gary Marshall's son, Scott delivers this gift.  The father son commentary alone is worth the purchase of this DVD.  This movie is A Classic!
  The cast is perfect except for Hines who I don't care for.  Piven and Getz are perfectly casted, and  have great comic chemistry.  Sabara was good.  Gary Marshall played the somewhat of a loser Jewish father perfectly.  The sense of redemption is believable in this comedy,  and difficult to produce on film.  Every normal 13 year old , along with their parents would enjoy this movie.  Bravo!  and thanks for the entertainment.....",1473984000,,575,4.864583333333333
