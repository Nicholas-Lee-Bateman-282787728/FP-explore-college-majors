8497691,5,B006GNPU8M,"Dos Hermanos is, on the surface, just that: the story of two siblings who are fundamentaly different in their approach to life. As it is often the case with Daniel Burman's films, there are deeper meanings ready to be discovered. It is not a coincidence that the movie comes out after a fairly long line of disputes between Uruguay and Argentina. The identification of Graciela Borges with Buenos Aires in contrast with Antonio Gasalla's confort with his surroundings in Uruguay, both point to a layer of meaning that would not be so readily comprehensible to US audiences. These two characters could very easily be read as the encarnation of the stereotypical porteo and the stereotypical Uruguayan (as seen from a Rio de la Plata perspective) In doing so, they become symbolic of the uneasy brotherhood that permeates the relation of the two coasts of the river. The final scene speaks volumes in terms of this interpretation of the story.
I also find the casting to be amazing. Both actors have been taken out of the type of roles the Argentine and Uruguayan audiences would expect from them. Just the fact that Gasalla is not playing a female character is, in itself, unusual. Gasalla is well known for embodying female characters as is the case in the cult film ""Waiting for the Hearse"", for example, or the theatrical rol of the mother in ""Ms respeto que soy tu madre"" and the countless female characters created by him in his TV performances. This is also true of Graciela Borges' character, which is just the opposite of the types of characters she is well known for. Personally, I find both performances to be nothing short of spectacular.",1328745600,,1648,4.806338028169014
8497692,4,B006GNPU8M,"A brother and sister in their fifties or sixties are forced into closer involvement after their mother dies and the sister presumptuously takes control of the estate while the brother struggles with choices between living the life he wants and protecting his sister by remaining passively under her control. Mature, funny, and occasionally tender - though usually tender in very guarded ways.",1323820800,,392,5.338709677419355
