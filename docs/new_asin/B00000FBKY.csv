7907500,5,B00000FBKY,"This film is truly evidence of the craft of film making being practiced to its fullest. Shot with a two person crew, one camera and less than a $6,000 budget, this is truly testimony that quality film making and thoughtful artistic practice can take the place of a flashy special effects budget that could cure an epidemic. ""Zohara"" is poetic, thoughtful, and aesthetically flooring. I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for something a little out of the ordinary in a wonderful way.",1048723200,2,494,4.892857142857143
