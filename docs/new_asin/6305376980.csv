7888255,3,6305376980,"First of all, this is a movie published by the horror magazine Fangoria, and the copy I've seen does NOT have spanish subtitles. I'm not sure why Amazon has this. Also, the full title is I,Zombie: The Chronicles of Pain. I first saw this movie on accident; I had meant to rent Zombie, but instead gotten I, Zombie. Of course Blockbuster screws up once more. Anyway, what I saw wasn't a huge dissapointment. This movie isn't your typical horror movie; yes, it has the hideous gore and blood, but the way it's set up is entirely different. It's the story of a man who goes walkig through a forest and gets  bitten by a woman. The movie follows his slow transformation into a zombie. While he is changing, he can still think human thoughts and restrain himself from eating human flesh. Slowly he dissolves into a zombie. The concept is interesting, but it doesnt fully work. The movie is obviously meant to be disturbing, but occasionaly one just laughs. For one, the music is very corny and silly. Weird keyboards and guitars in the worst possible parts of the movie. Did you ever expect to see someone's ribcage being torn open while semi-happy keyboards play? Also, when a movie features a masturbating zombie....i mean c'mon, do they expect that to scare people? Overall, the movie is good, but doesn't live up to its expectations. Under the hands of a good director, it could have been excellent. Sadly, it looks and feels like a director who's still in college taking math courses.",994896000,,1484,4.685823754789272
