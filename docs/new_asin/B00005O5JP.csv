1639365,5,B00005O5JP,I find it ridiculous that a cinematic genre that is Scandanavian in content is available only for the US and Canada (Region 1 encoding). Please release for Scandanavian/European DVDs. It requires only simple decoding.,1012262400,5,217,5.411764705882353
1639366,2,B00005O5JP,"This feature packed DVD has everything fans of this film could want. The trouble is, how many fans are there? It is an odd silent movie about witchcraft. Some scenes are over the top. Many are just dull. I did find the commentary interesting. In fact, the commentary was more interesting than the movie. Only for silent collectors and hard core film historians.",1011916800,8,361,4.746031746031746
1639367,4,B00005O5JP,"I bought HAXAN (Witchcraft through the ages) because I am interested in religion, have been reading the Ankarloo and Clark historical series on 'WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE' and I admire Criterion films. I knew nothing about HAXAN before I saw the Criterion DVD.
HAXAN appears to have been well restored.  All the details including the orginal breaks for the seven reels of film have been retained in the 1920s version. Two versions, the original released in the early 20s and a jazzed up version released in the early 40s are included. The DVD also offers subtitles in many languages. The sound track for the 1920s version is wonderful and with a full listing of the music included -- Schubert, Tschaikovsky, and others. I was amazed with the cinematography--lighting, fadeouts, etc.  This film will appeal to those interested in film making.
HAXAN seems to be a somewhat serious attempt to explain ""witchcraft"" via the Freudian psychoanalysis -- popular in the early part of the 20th Century. The director shows women engaging in witchlike behaviours in the ""olden days"" and then behaving in antisocial ways (shoplifting, for example) in modern times. He suggests their behaviour could be explained by mental problems.
The film lacks historical accuracy but this is largely owing to the sources the filmmakers used (shown in a references section). These sources perpetuated the myth that the Roman Catholic church acted alone in the persecution of people for witchcraft.  Although current historical research contradicts this notion many cling to it as ""truth.""
WITCHCRAFT AND MAGIC IN EUROPE (Ankarloo and Clark), a six volume series based on historical research undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s reveals the persecution of witches continued long after Protestants controlled Northern Europe. Most of those burned at the stake in Europe in the 17th Century were burned in the Protestant North, especially Germany and Denmark (HAXAN is a Danish film). In fact, research based on secular court records and other administrative data (not just the notes kept by Inquisitors) suggests a number of RC priests were burned as sorcerers. Seems the RCs were very involved in ""magic"" but not always in the way earlier accounts suggested. Also, there is a great deal of evidence the Inquisitors may have fudged their records a bit!!  When the same person turns up for prosecution nine times, something is fishy.
HAXAN is melodramatic and if I didn't take witchcraft seriously I might laugh, but to me the persecution of anyone because of their religious beliefs is heinious, and laughing at the suffering of those accused of witchcraft and punished for their supposed involvement is akin to laughing at Holocaust victims.",1004227200,20,2715,5.149659863945578
1639368,5,B00005O5JP,"One of the most famous cult/horror films from the silent era, Benjamin Christensen's ""Hxan"" is at its devilish best on this EXCELLENT DVD release by the great folks at the Criterion Collection. Say good-bye to those murky, washed out video prints we've all had to put up with, and say hello to a nearly flawless print of the film wonderfully transfered to the disc. The images are so crisp and clear, many of the scenes look as if they could have been filmed yesterday. The clarity also allows for you to see much more of the detail in each frame. Also lending to the beautiful images is accurate tinting and correct ""projection"" speed. Also included is a terrific musical score which has been reconstructed from the actual music that accompanied the original 1922 release in Denmark.
Extras include movie outtakes, production stills, audio commentary, and the 1960's version of the film with William S. Burroughs narrating.
The bottom line: this is far and away the best version of ""Hxan"" you will find anywhere, and belongs in the collection of any silent film buff.",1003968000,46,1068,4.841530054644808
1639369,5,B00005O5JP,"I have just finished watching the new Criterion dvd of Haxan and I couldn't be more pleased! I have never seen this film, but thought I would try it out, as I have always had a fascination with the grotesque, mysticism, and the occult. Haxan delivers in spades.
This 1922 Danish silent film about black magic, witches, satanism, and the persecution of said subjects during the middle-ages, which attempts to make a connection between the ancient phenomena and the modern study of hysteria (modern in 1922), has been wonderfully presented by The Criterion Collection in their new dvd. This new Criterion dvd has the original 104 min. version with a newly recorded 5.0 soundtrack orchestrated from archival documentation, and the 76 min. version released in 1967, which has narration by legendary counter-culture icon William S. Burroughs.
Watching the original version, I found it full of great imagery and fine silent acting. Emotions and actions are superbly conveyed by the actors, and the sets, costumes, lighting, and effects are all wonderfully done. I especially like the interrogation chamber and the Sabbath scenes, which display lots of good props and much deviltry with rather convincing special effects and make-up. The movie is structured in seven chapters, the first giving a historical account of witchcraft's origins in literature and illustrations. We then are presented with drama plays, having to do with the practice of witches, and the persecution, trying, and torturing of said witches. We are also presented with several instances of the devil manifesting and making demands on his minions. In the end, Christensen attempts to make a correlation between the acts, mannerisms, and various disfigurements anciently attributed to witches and their craft, and the modern affects of hysteria. This is apparently the most criticized part of the film, as mentioned in the commentary, and while it certainly is not as strong as the period dramas, I think it does a good job of raising valid questions, and does work with the film quite well.
As for the quality of the transfer... with the exception of element specs throughout, and just a few scenes marred by scrapes, the print is very clean and clear. I thought it looked great. True, the print could have been cleaned up a bit more as far as the specs go, but not every film Criterion does will get the star treatment given Akira Kuroswa's ""Seven Samurai"". So long as contrast is good, and edges are well defined, I'm usually a happy camper, and this transfer delivers.
The new score was arranged by film music specialist Gillian Anderson who attempted to recreate the music presented at the film's Danish premiere as best as possible by referencing the list of musical cues printed in the theater's weekly program notes. It includes works from Franz Schubert, Richard Wagner, Max Bruch, W.A. Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Christoph Gluck, and Ludwig Van Beethovan, as well as others. Anderson conducted the Czech Film Orchestra in June 2001. The score does an incredible job of accompanying the film, sounds wonderful, and is is presented in 5.0 Dolby Digital.
There is a knock-out commentary here. Narrated by Danish silent film scholar Caspar Tybjerg, the commentary centers on the director Benjamin Christensen's life in film, the Danish silent film industry, origin of the documentary film genre, technical aspects of Haxan, the cast of Haxan, historical aspects of the study of hysteria in psychology circles, the origins of the devil as a character in media, and of course, the phenomena of witchcraft and witch hunting. References are made to Nosferatu, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the German Expressionist movement, The Passion of Joan of Arc, The Seventh Seal, Sigmund Freud... the list goes on and on. While there is an incredible amount of information presented here, with bibliographic references even, Tybjerg does an excellent job of tying it all together and presenting the relevance of the material to the film. This was a very engaging look at Christensen, his film, and the sociological atmosphere both during the middle-ages, and during the time of Haxan's production.
As for the 1967 version narrated by William S. Burroughs, ""Witchcraft Through The Ages""... I must say that I have not sat through the whole thing. In fact, I just watched the first two segments before finally succumbing to sleep (I have, gladly, spent a LOT of time with this dvd, but have to sleep sometime). My first impression is, while Burroughs is always so interestingly droning yet intense in the same breath, the jazz score was just plain ridiculous, in the presentation of Haxan anyway. The producer composed a jazz score for the film, which by itself, is some very hip music indeed, but it was just terribly out of place in the film. I'm sure the production was aiming to enhance drug trips rather than present the film itself. With Burroughs involvement, I don't think I'm too far of base in this. I'll have to give it another go when I've had some sleep, so I can watch the whole thing, but I doubt I'll be changing my mind. The jazz score is just too out of place, and as Christensen has often said, dialogue would ruin Haxan, as well as several silent films. After witnessing this 1967 version, I must agree with the director.
For avid students of special effects, I would make an evening of it with Haxan, as well as Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"", and ""Der Golum"", found on Elite's ""Masterworks of the German Horror Cinema"" dvd set. Much mysticism, magic and enchantment abound in these films, and state-of-the-art at-the-time special effects to boot.
I am extremely happy with this dvd, and highly recommend it to anyone who is into the study of classic film or anyone who is interested in the occult, whether solely for entertainment or as a study of sociological phenomena.",1003795200,149,5843,4.981576253838281
1639370,4,B00005O5JP,"What a great time to be a silent film enthusiast. Thanks to video technology it's now possible to have access to more silent films than ever before and in the best condition since their original release. For years Danish director Benjamin Christensen's 1922 controversial ""documentary"" HAXAN (The Witch) has been available (when it's been available) in either lousy public domain copies projected at the wrong speed or in the extremely funky edited version narrated by William Burroughs with a modern jazz score. Now with the help of the Swedish Film Institute and Home Vision Cinema/Criterion Collection it is finally possible to see the film the way that Christensen intended it. Over thirty minutes of censored footage has been restored along with original tints that make this version far superior to anything that has been previously available.

For those of you who know HAXAN only through the William Burroughs version known as WITCHCRAFT THROUGH THE AGES, it too has been included in this new release (DVD and VHS) so you can see the difference. Added bonuses include footage of Christensen in 1941 (in addition to directing he also portrayed Satan) and outtakes from various scenes. While not a great film it remains a remarkable, gripping experience full of striking images that stay with you long after the film is over. Although not a documentary in the true sense of the word, it does attempt to portray a selected history of what was called witchcraft and how it was brutally dealt with by the church. Scenes of nudity, torture, carnal lust, and flagellation helped to get it banned in several countries as well as heavily edited.

While the film is not for everyone it should be seen at least once for once seen it cannot be forgotten and now it's possible to see it restored to its former glory. Although it's great to have the original version, it's also good to have the Burroughs version as well. Another excellent job from the Home Vision people (who brought us Dreyer's PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC and Pabst's PANDORA'S BOX). Thanks to the Criterion Collection for making it available on DVD. Though here in time for Halloween, HAXAN is definitely not for kids! Even after 80 years.",1003536000,17,2198,4.890080428954423

The settings are beautiful, and the settings involving witches and demons are chilling and scary.  Like Nosferatu, this movie continues to be scary even to this day.  The costumes design for the devil is pretty scary.  And the special effects are amazing.  Now this is technically a documentary, but it has sequences that can also make it count as a horror film.  It has great info that I didn't even know at the time until I saw this.  This is actually one of the best horror films I have ever seen and is now one of my all time favorite movies.  I even e-mailed James Rolfe to review it in this year's Monster Madness on Cinemassacre and he reviewed it on October 2, 2014.",1404432000,2,769,4.359154929577465
1639426,4,B00005O5JP,"Nice restoration by Criterion, you almost wouldn't believe the film was made in 1922.  For its time this is a pretty objective rendition of medieval witch hunt frenzy.  Not very flattering of organized religion but then this is what makes this movie refreshing.  The sets and acting are exaggerated probably to lend some levity on the serious subject matter.  They could of done without the blue and red tinting, but maybe that was real novelty in the silent movie era and they kept this feature for posterity's sake.  The version with the jazz score and Burrough's dry narration was different but not necessarily better.  I also think the musical score in this version was inappropriate, but the narration did lend exposition to the story.  Maybe having the original orchestral score with Burrough's droning narration would be better, if you don't mind the clash of genres.  Other than that, this is a nice DVD to one's collection.",1402790400,6,932,4.92948717948718
1639427,3,B00005O5JP,"Criterion Collection's restoration of HAXAN is flawless. The film looks practically new.
It's also more detailed than I remember, with chapter (reel?) titles.

It's a shame but commentary here is so tedious, all read from a prepared script with almost nothing matching on screen action. I don't know why these scholars can't rely on comments made while actually observing the movie.

The restored version is considerably longer than the alternate 1968 American re-release, one that includes a free-form jazz score and appropriate comments from William Burroughs. Color tinting of the original may be botched (not sure). Only two shades are used, blue and red, and they're almost continuous. At first I liked the effect but in 90 minutes it wears on you.

A long time ago I had a videotape of HAXAN (aka ""Witchcraft"" etc.) with no music track, no tints.
It's still the best one I've seen. (The full-length original has far too many intertitles.)",1383264000,2,944,5.038461538461538

1639450,4,B00005O5JP,"The historical possibilities show more truth than fiction.  The Catholic Church, and later the fundamentalists Protestants, decimated millions of people, both male and female, sometimes totally slaughtering the populations of entire villages and cities, or sometimes just the women.

  But it left out the males; the hermits, the homosexuals, the healers, both male and female, who were slaughtered because the so-called medical doctors who were sanctioned by the church openly murdered these people, so these so-called doctors could take over the birthing of babies instead of the midwives.

  Through the following years, and even today these so-called doctors have, and are still heartlessly killing off people, and with Obama Care the slaughter will continue with the heartless denying of food and water to patients.

  This work is just as valid today as it was in the 1920's.  The present vaccines and ""medicines"" have long term harmful effects, do not treat causes of ailments, but rather, the symptoms, and not even those in mental health psycho-tropic medications.  Those slowly destroy the brain; speed, Prozac, and many more are known to do fr more harm than good, and lead to horrendous crimes in this country, such as the slaughter of  school children in Connecticut.

  Old, ancient, but still valid.  The past is being repeated, this is a soft-shoe version of what has been on-going for hundreds of years.",1355702400,2,1420,5.212389380530974
1639451,5,B00005O5JP,"If you haven't seen this phenomenal silent film then by all means do. It's a Swedish film about witchcraft and the frenzied denials and condemnations that surrounded it during the Middle Ages, and up until the present. Well, 1922, anyway, which is when this film was made.

The visuals of Haxan are astounding, on a par with any CGI magic you see today. These pics only represent a fraction of what is in the film. It's an absolutely gorgeous piece of art and seriously, if you haven't seen it, try. You will not be disappointed.",1320537600,3,529,4.568421052631579
1639452,5,B00005O5JP,"During the years of the silent film -around the twenties- Sweden was among the leading countries of the seventh art. Directors of the stature of Victor Sjstrm, Mauritz Stiller and Bernard Christensen made films considered by contemporaries such as classical masterpieces and for posterity. Films such as Krkarlen (Sjstrm) Herr Arnes pengar (Stiller), were based on accounts of the Swedish Nobel Selma Lagerlf.

But Bernard Christensen with Carl Dreyer (Leaves from satan Book)or Fritz Lang (Destiny) was ahead of his countrymen with this enigmatic, well crafted and superbly illustrated story about the witchcraft through the ages.

Assault on graves, tortures, possessed nuns and a satanic Sabbath. He employed a set of dramatic vignettes to explore the scientific hypothesis that the witches of the Middle Ages suffered the same hysteria respect psychiatric patients of the past century.

Spiced cocktail of fear, rudeness and black humor. From 1922 comes this treasured and so hailed film that all hard movie buff of the silentfilms (As I am) must have in their film essential collection.

A supreme masterwork all the way through.",1314144000,2,1134,5.353932584269663
1639453,5,B00005O5JP,"Loved Criterion's presentation.  I would only say that I was a bit put off by the 1968 version.  The droning Burroughs was a bore and the ""music"" sounded like someone dropped matchsticks in a garrett and was completely inappropriate for what was going on.  Why do these newer directors think they have the right to adulterate a perfectly good film with their terrible adaptations.",1310947200,,380,4.90625
1639454,5,B00005O5JP,"Haxan is a 1922 Swedish/Danish silent film. It is partly a documentary on medieval beliefs about witchcraft, partly a horror movie, partly an exploitation flick, and partly a treatise on a now long-discredited scientific hypothesis. This film is unclassifiable and highly enjoyable. Some of the early special effects look good even today. Other visuals are laughable, but that is part of the appeal. It is creepy seeing a witch pulling a disembodied arm out of a bundle of hay, and it is very funny seeing Satan influencing a bunch of nuns to start dancing in front of the altar. Sure this movie is a bit dated, but it is still highly watchable even on repeat viewings. It is also a great look into the history of filmmaking.

The Criterion Collection release has extremely clear picture. Yes, there are still a large number of anomalies on the film, but it seems apparent that the technicians took a long time to clean up the film the best they could. The only time I had previously watched Haxan was on YouTube, and I am amazed at how much clear detail I can see on my TV screen with this Criterion DVD. The orchestral score (a new recording of a 1922 score) works for the film but is nothing special. It does not do very much to enhance the film, but it also is never annoying. It seems to work nicely in the background just so your ears have something to do while you're watching the film.

The special features are awesome. I haven't yet listened to the commentary by a Danish silent film scholar, but I plan to soon. There is a 1968 version of Haxan called Witchcraft Through the Ages which is the original silent film with added narration by novelist William S. Burroughs and a jazz score. The narration sometimes adds much to the film and is sometimes ponderous. The jazz score is groovy and trippy, but it sometimes doesn't work well with the film - especially in the supposed-to-be-creepy scene where the witch is holding a severed arm.

Rounding out the special features there is a 1941 introduction to the film by the director during which he spends about 10 minutes talking about historical witches (worth a watch), a detailed breakdown of the sources used for the films illustrations, and a few screen tests. One of the screen tests is particularly worth watching, the special effects test for the flying-on-brooms scene in which a man riding a chair is superimposed over a landscape filmed from a moving train.

Some may see Haxan as a mere historical curiosity, but I think that the Criterion package is too good to pass up. I highly recommed this to all fans of early documentaries or early horror movies. Also if you've ever seen The Passion of Joan of Arc then you should definitely check out Haxan.",1309305600,4,2718,4.632780082987552
1639455,5,B00005O5JP,"I don't exaggerate in the least when I tell you that the Criterion release of ""Hxan"" is one of the most fascinating DVD's in my collection - a collection that currently includes almost 2,000 titles. This one is a winner on two levels - both as a transfer of an exquisitely restored silent film, and as a record of that film's intriguing metamorphosis over the past 90 years.

First released in 1922, ""Hxan"" was filmed the previous year by Danish filmmaker Benjamin Christiansen.  The first portion of the film is a pseudo-scholarly documentary that examines the historical record of witches and witch hunts via ancient texts and artwork obtained from many rare and obscure sources.  After this introduction, the film segues into a series of scenes in which the rituals of witchcraft and the hunts for witches are imaginatively and creatively depicted.  We are shown witches brewing kettles into which live snakes and toads are poured, as well as a vivid enactment of a witches' Sabbat during which the participants dance with creatures from Hell and kiss the Devil's arse.  Unlike other versions of the film available on DVD, Criterion's print is complete, and has been reproduced from a color-tinted and speed-corrected master which resides in the collection of the Swedish Film Institute, accompanied by a musical score adapted from the one played at the film's original Danish premiere.  Bizarre and potent stuff indeed!

But Criterion enriches the viewer's experience further by offering a wealth of extras, including: a great commentary track; a visual bibliography of the texts, woodcuts and drawings referenced in the film; a selection of rare outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage; and a small stills gallery.  Criterion also includes the sound introduction to the film's 1941 re-release, in which director Christiansen appears to expound upon his theory that those millions of people (mostly women) who were tried and executed in centuries past for the crime of witchcraft were actually suffering from the psychological condition diagnosed as ""hysteria"" in the first half of the 20th Century.

Finally, as the icing on an already rich and delectable cake, Criterion includes the 1968 re-cutting of ""Hxan"" - which eliminated the silent title cards, added narration by William Burroughs and a jazz soundtrack by Jean-Luc Ponty, and which was projected at a slightly faster speed.  This version, which runs 76 minutes as opposed to the original's 104 minutes, also omits the color tints in favor of austere black-and-white and was retitled, ""Witchcraft Through the Ages"".  The changes give the film an entirely different timber and tone, and show the power inherent in the filmmaking and film exhibition processes.

I am pleased to be able to recommend the Criterion version of ""Hxan"" / ""Witchcraft Through the Ages"" without reservations.  This DVD will appeal broadly to fans of silent film, to documentarians, to film scholars, and to those interested in the subjects of witchcraft, magic, sorcery, and the Middle Ages.",1295827200,5,3028,5.205761316872428

1639470,5,B00005O5JP,"Benjamin Christensen presents a series of recreations based on historical accounts of witchcraft throughout the ages. The film is told in a documentary format with a scholarly narration, and is accompanied by stills, etchings, and staged re-enactments of the occult, devil-worship, and witchery. While many of the vignettes are extreme exaggerations of true events, they are portrayed as the realistic social stereotypes associated with the practice of witchcraft from the Middle Ages to the present. The performances are convincing if not a bit theatrical, and they lack the eccentric overacting common to the German Expressionist films of this period. In addition to the incredible Gothic and Expressionist set designs, HAXAN produces haunting images of an array of ghouls and devils, using impressive costuming and make-up work to bring the creatures of the Medieval etchings into a terrifying reality. Scenes where Satan tempts supple young virgins, a coven of witches takes flight over the city, demons dance by firelight, ghouls feast on the blood of babies, and props from the torture chamber are demonstrated on willing participants leave a lasting impression on the audience. Christensen and his crew also experiment with early forms of reverse photography, stop-motion animation, overlays, and numerous other techniques that were decades ahead of their time. Pacing is the greatest fault found mostly in the final third of the film, where comparisons between Satanic possession and modern hysteria fall flat. Few films have painted the occult in such surreal and nightmarish terms, making HAXAN a unique and frightening experience.

1639471,5,B00005O5JP,"This is a beautiful rendition of both the original 104 min. 1922 version and the  76 min. William S. Burroughs version from 1967.  The picture and sound (there is a recreation of the original music that was to be played with the 1922 version) is the type of quality one expects from Criterion.

The commentary is also top notch giving you not only a greater insight into the film but into its maker as well and for those portions that are too short for full audio explanation there is another section on the DVD that allows you learn more about them at your leisure.

Even though my first experience was with the later William S. Burroughs version the 1922 version is definitely the superior one.  Perhaps because the Burroughs was my first introduction to this film I don't find the jazz music as annoying as other people do.  In some respects the Burroughs version is as much a remake as it is an edit and if viewed in that light makes it enjoyable in its own right.",1264896000,,968,4.440677966101695
1639472,5,B00005O5JP,"Hxan is an excellent 1922 silent film that depicted the practice of religion and witchcraft during the Middle Ages. In this movie, superstitious characters created unrest in what were once peaceful, European dwellings. Whenever plagues spread throughout communities or lustful temptations occurred within the clergy of a synagogue, a scapegoat would have to shoulder the blame for society's ills. The alleged perpetrator could be identified and found guilty on the basis of physical appearance. If the individual were deformed, then he/she could be deemed as the devil in the flesh; if, on the other hand, the defendant was an attractive woman whose beauty was captivating, then chances were, she would be branded a witch who enticed the sexual imaginings of many a young man.

With an effective cast who could act out the paranoid mindset that was swelling and spreading, Hxan had and still has the ability to lead viewers into witnessing some  darker realms of humanity that were under the guise of spirituality. The emotion of fear, in conjunction with superstitions regarding a village's misfortunes, would prevail throughout this movie. As it would often fall in line with the edicts of those in power, namely the clerics, and as it would secure the standings of those already at the top, fear, as it would be experienced among laypersons and lower-ranking pastorates, overruled logic.

It can be argued that Hxan was a creative exposition to the adage that wrong people in power, if given the opportunity, will try to control the minds of others by  keeping them poor, blind, scared and stupid. Hxan is based on a premise that a collective mindset built upon rumor, superstition and hate is highly dangerous.

Though this movie is nearly ninety years old, Hxan does have its fascinating, visual effects that were perhaps way ahead of their time. Portions of the movie depicted those deemed as the outsiders, that is to say, the pagans or devil worshippers who performed rituals that consisted of costumes, masks, and fire altars with some similarities to the pagan festivities in the 1973 movie, The Wicker Man. And it is within these ceremonial scenes that the stunning, technical aspects of the film arise.

The viewer is transported right away into a different dimension, where it is not clear if it is supposed to be an outer, spiritual world that exists or the enactment of what was in the mind's eye of the superstitious. Nonetheless, the presence of ghostlike figures and demons helped to create as stunning a heaven-or-hell dilemma as what one could possibly hope for from this film. The trick photography for enhancing the awesome spectral appearances leaves little doubt that ten years later, Carl Theodor Dreyer's use of ectoplasmic imagery in his 1932 film, Vampyr, was inspired by the viewing of Hxan.

All in all, this classic is, to say the least, a quintessential two-for-one. It is a perfect docudrama in the history of human behavior, and it is the perfect expositor of the genius of Benjamin Christensen, the movie's writer and director.",1244073600,4,3062,5.0395256916996045
1639473,5,B00005O5JP,"Despite the fact that this movie was made in 1922, its treatment of witchcraft through the ages is remarkably enlightened and contemporary.

In two versions -- the original and a modern redub from 1967 -- this movie tells the story of witchcraft through the ages from its unquestioned acceptance by the ancients to a more enlightened and modern view that the supposed signs of the witch are just undiagnosed mental disorders.

While if this movie was redone today an additional vignette on thought contagion and suggestability might well be in order, it bears noting that nothing about the existing movie -- including its silent format -- would require a single change.

That's because when all is said and done this movie says that the scariest thing about witchcraft was never its supposed practitioners but rather those individuals who shamelessly tried to use the fears of others to enrich themselves at the expense of the innocent.

In other words, this movie had the courage to both ask and answer the question of where the real witches could be found.",1228089600,2,1058,4.926966292134831
1639474,5,B00005O5JP,"This is a good production of this classic by Benjamin Christensen.  For $[...] dollars less than what else is readily available through Amazon and even cheaper through the available resellers, this DVD is a bargain.  In all honesty, you may watch it once or twice over your lifetime so why spend $[...] bucks on it?  Most of the bonus material you find on the other DVD available can be found on the internet anyway.",1226016000,2,416,4.594594594594595
1639475,5,B00005O5JP,"Haxan, also known as Witchcraft Through the Ages, is Benjamin Christensen's masterpiece.  It should be noted that Christensen himself gives a memorable performance as Satan, joyfully seducing a wife in bed next to her sleeping husband and gleefully terrorizing a priest during a moment of weakness. Unfortunately, HAXAN is the only film directed by Benjamin Christensen which is widely available today.

HAXAN contains several incredible sequences depicting devil worship in a very vivid manner which still retain their power to shock today eighty years later. I do not know how Christensen was allowed to get away with it back then - and indeed the film was heavily censored in its initial showings around the world - but I guess it was evident that the director's aim was not to wallow gratuitously in sensationalism but to portray as realistic a tableau of witchcraft through the ages as was possible at the time.",1223856000,,916,5.059602649006623

Benjamin Christensen shows his twisted side by playing both Satan and Jesus in this film.  Haxan is Christensen's interpretation of what may have happened during the Salem Witch Trials.  It is clearly a documentary but due to the time, the scenes of historical representation are acted out.  This film is strange by all means.  You will lose all focus on the fact that this film was made as a documentary while you are watching demons prancing across the camera lens.

The acting is really quite corny, but how the events are shown is pretty uch in tune with what historians agree actually happened.  Witches are not normally the sexy seductress, but instead were the ugly crones who have no way to defend themselves.  The inquisition stepped in to help bring about confessions, and without basic civil legal rights, the condemned was usually convicted through confessions.

This movie shows the whole gamut of events.  The sick child, the succubus, the trials, the temptations, and the trials.  There are no real special effects, but it kind of amazes me that no other film has attempted to cover this same subject as this film does.  It's a rare find, but worth the time spent watching it.",1223251200,3,812,4.716312056737588
1639478,5,B00005O5JP,"You've got to be kidding me, this movie is [.......] amazing! Haxan is a silent mockumentary film from 1922 about witchcraft and superstition. It plays out almost as an educational film about the history of witchcraft, but it's more like a satire on the idiocy of the human race in general. I was so entertained and involed with what was going on I forgot this was a silent film at all. 86 year's later it's still finding it's followers (me) and is much better than anything to come out recently. Stop motion animation, nudity, and reverse footage in the 1920's?!?! Not to mention grave robbing and other distasteful event's. Worth every penny!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",1205884800,3,670,4.885964912280702
1639479,5,B00005O5JP,"I've always enjoyed B&W movies, but was never much into silent films until a couple of years ago. Some of them are really amazing in terms of plot & sexuality. The Silent Era was fortunately before the censorship of the late 30's that dictated things like bra size & how close actors could be with each other when doing a kissing (and no French, please!) The TMC channel recently hosted a night of silents that featured ""Gay Actors."" It was a scream. I don't know how many people out there in Cyperland remember Zazu Pitts (perfect name!), but her silent shorts (as in film length, not leg wear) are really funny and perfectly performed. Anyway, I had seen little snippets of Hxan used to illustrate documentaries, but only ten seconds or so--and while doing my own research on witchcraft (doesn't everybody?), decided it was time to take a longer look.

At first the introductory segment is reminiscent of phys-ed ""just say no to premarital sex"" films. However, in Hxan the format is a deliberate & sophisticated seeting up of what follows. I say ""sophisticated"" because the movie works with the subject on different levels and dimensions. Sometimes you can't even believe what you are seeing!

The ways the film weaves various themes reminded me of ""Intolerance"" by (racist) American director D.W. Griffith; but I think Hxan presents an even more fully integrated multilayered storyline. Another interesting feature is the use of sepia (reddish brown) tinting, to give an even more documentary and realistic effect. The added background music fits perfectly; often an effective counterpoint to the action.

The acting too is very believeable, very realistic for the time. In fact, it would be considered suplerative even today. Religious and social prejudices are broadly & authentically lampooned in images so realistic that sometimes watching the movie is like looking through a peek hole in time.

Anyone interested in film history and/or the occultism/horror must see Hxan.

[NOTE 12/08: I just saw the new price for this DVD and it is totally outrageous. At this price deduct at least 3 of my precious stars. Rent it or forget it.]

[NOTE 12/10: Hey, they actually brought the price DOWN! This movie is definitely worth 24 bucks. I can highly recommend it now.]

1639515,5,B00005O5JP,"I was prepared to not be hugely impressed by this film, since I'd heard it doesn't really have a plot, but I ended up really loving it.  Sometimes an episodic structure can work better for a film than being plot- and character-driven, particularly in a film such as this one.  It's part documentary, part cultural and historical overview of, as the subtitle says, ""witchcraft through the ages.""  It starts out with various drawings from different cultures, depicting their views of the universe and evil spirits, and then goes into the meat of the film, the terror of the Burning Times in Europe, in this case in Germany, where most of the women falsely accused of being witches lived.  We first see the types of people who were accused of witchcraft, such as two medical students who dug up a fresh corpse for dissection purposes, a coven of women using white Magick for various ends, and an old woman who casts an evil spell on a man who cursed her.  This leads up to the story that takes up most of the film, the trial of Maria the Weaver, who has been accused of being a witch simply because she's old, desperate, and homely, and because the people whose house she went into for some food are the typical superstitious people of the time, believing she's the reason the man of the house suddenly fell ill.  Following the lengthy story of Maria's trial, eventual forced ""confession,"" and the subsequent arrests and trials of other people in town, there's a chapter about how many nuns of the era were thought to be possessed of the Devil, either because of excessive religious piety and things like self-flaggelation, or because their strong belief in such things became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The film's final section, the modern coda, is admittedly the weakest chapter, and appears a bit dated today in spots.  It attempts to explain the seemingly strange behavior and reactions of women accused of witchcraft by the retroactive diagnosis of hysteria and related psychiatric and neurological disorders.  The hysteria described herein, which includes insensitivity on some parts of the body, is known as conversion disorder today and has nothing in common with the long-debunked pseudocondition ""female hysteria.""  While it certainly seems laudable to have turned a modern scientific eye towards explaining some of these strange phenomena, today it seems just as simplistic and nave as the Medieval belief in dark forces and witches.  Its connection to the witch trials also seems a stretch; how are we supposed to see any real similarities between a kleptomaniac or sleepwalker and the average woman denounced for ""witchcraft,"" nor between someone legitimately suffering from conversion disorder?

The acting is really phenomenal, and the special effects and makeup are spellbinding considering the era.  All of the scenes of Devil-worship, orgies, secret covens, people flying through the air on broomsticks, torture instruments, and other diabolical things are very well-done, surprisingly R-rated for the era, and enough to satisfy anyone with a taste for the macabre and classic horror.  And since I'm very interested in Medieval history, I loved how most of it was set during the Middle Ages, with so many great costumes, sets, and depictions of Medieval life.  For those who can get past the fact that it happens to be silent and from 1922, the theme is timeless and just as pertinent today as it was back then, that we need to get past ignorant fears and superstitions about the world and towards people who aren't in line with what is believed to be the norm, and use reason, knowledge, compassion, and science to explain and understand things we don't understand.

Extras are an incredible commentary by Danish film scholar Caspar Tybjerg, a stills gallery, outtakes (particularly valuable since barely any films from the silent era have surviving outtakes), a filmed introduction to the 1941 re-release, by director Benjamin Christensen, a gallery of all of the still images presented in the film, along with more detailed commentary about them, and the 1968 re-released version of the film, which has narration by William S. Burroughs and a modern jazz score which can be a bit intrusive and inappropriate at times.  This version can probably only be explained by virtue of the fact that it was the Sixties.",1195689600,2,4329,5.006963788300836

Even with the subtitles.... even better when someone reads them aloud, this movie is actually fun and the symbolism is just darn funny.  For instance, in one part the 'devil'.... your basic horned ugly entity, has the witches lined up to kiss his butt.  And the makeup on the priests is just down right scary!  I have the vhs but plan to purchase this dvd even though it is a little pricey, it's worth it to me and my friends.

1639517,5,B00005O5JP,"This is not what I expected at all, from reading the back of the Criterion dvd you hear about Grave Robbing, torture, possessed nuns, and a satanic sabbath, so I'm thinking a horror movie.  What i got was writer director Benjamin Christensen exposing witchcraft for what it really was, mental disorders.  He does this first with some dark comedy which reminded me of Jeff Foxworthy's whole bit about you might be a redneck if, however here it's you might be a witch if.  It's infuriating almost, to see how ignorance and fear of anything and anyone different were proclaimed witches and tortured and murdered.  If you denied being a witch then you were tortured until you basically just wanted to die, so you would say anything they wanted.  Prisoners were often tricked into saying they were a witch in exchange for freedom.  I got a kick out of the woman who gets tortured till she's had enough and says I'll tell you everything and starts naming off everybody that's done her wrong and how there witches as well, smart idea.  In my opinion everyone that cuts me off in traffic are witches.  At the end he shows how modern day (being the 20's) it is hysteria and mental disorders, which we have specific names for every disorder he shows, and not the work of witches.
There are images of horror but it's more describing the peoples fear and nothing that actually happened.
I was surprised on the internet movie database that the only genre this falls into is horror.  It's a a whole lot deeper than that i believe and plays true today and every decade since.
The real horror and probably the scariest of all is the judgmental ignorance and fear by man of anything different, and in this film if there was something that couldn't be understood, well then blame it on someone that looks and acts different and call them a Witch.
History repeats itself unfortunately you could use this same film today and use witches and then at the end of the movie you could replace mental disorders with Hitler and the Jews.  You could use witches and then supplement mental disorders with slavery, racism and segregation.  Again use witches and replace mental disorders with ""the evil doers"" our president refers too.  Who will be the ""witches"" of the next generation?  That is the horror.
This is a great and important film.

1639521,4,B00005O5JP,"If you didn't know it...Haxan is a silent movie.  It is a really good silent movie too (that is if you like movies that don't have Vin Deisel rocking out your subwoofers with huge explosions).  The film starts out seeminly like a documentary about Withcraft through history.  The film follows that path, but is just so strange and fascinating that you will most likely forget all about the documentary part.  Instead of like basic documentaries shown today on the History Channel, Haxan's historical scenes are actually acted out in true film fashion.  The catch is that Satan actually is in the film (played by the director himself).  Once things start flying, horned demons go out dancing, and the peasants start kissing the director's a$$ (wow...now that is a true statement about Hollywood...MADE ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AGO), it is no longer a documentary, it is some freaky comedy played out with an humourously lighthearted soundtrack.  Criterion even went as far as to include the original shading to the film (nothing beats a red washed scene quickly switching to blue, then back to red before going into a true black and white scene).  To be honest, the colour shadings get kind of annoying (even if they are true to how the film originally was).  Yet, they can be easily corrected by adjusting your television set.
If you want a shorter film about Satan set to a jazzy soundtrack, there is another version of the film included on the DVD for your viewing pleasure.  It is also narrated by a very famous person with a voice that just makes you smile every time Satan gets a mortal soul eternally damned to hell.  Nothing beats laughing at eternal damnation while listening to an excellenct jazz soundtrack.
Basically, Haxan is a very good film if you like silent films.  It isn't the best silent film out there, but it is still extremely interesting.  Of course, it isn't for everyone, mainly just for the collectors and those who enjoy the fine intracacies of the silent film era.  There is good news though!  Even if aren't a film buff, a fan of silent films, or interested in this film in anyway, there are a couple of ways that this film can appeal to you (both of which have been experienced first-hand with highly positive results...honestly).
1.  Play this film at a party, when everyone gets drunk, nothing is more hilarious than watching peasants kissing Satan's [behind].  In fact, watching that scene over and over again while drunk can be the life of any dead party.
2.  If you are in a death metal band (particularly one that seems obsessed with the 80's hair metal scene) then grab yourself a digital projector and project this film behind you while you play.  You are guaranteed to have roadies before the stockades make an appearance.  If you have an extremely long set, either hit play again or switch out Haxan with Freaks halfway through.",1054252800,14,2866,4.751515151515152
1639522,5,B00005O5JP,"Witchcraft and demonic possession pervade popular entertainment and popular culture.  ""Haxan: Witchcraft Through The Ages"" by director Benjamin Christensen is a valuable reference because the film *graphically details* 1920's perceptions concerning witchcraft and demonic possession.  ""Haxan: ..."" illustrates kissing the devil's arse as a sign of respect, depicts demonic skin as rough and scaly like snakeskin, equates golden showers of coins (from slot machines?) with demonic lures, and states that the inability to shed tears signifies demonic possession (I can't cry anymore?).
Updated in 1967 with narration by William Burroughs (author of ""The Naked Lunch""), ""Haxan: ..."" is a study of ignorance, misery and poverty.  The film attributes the origins of disease (including sexual dysfunction) and agricultural blight (with implied bestiality?) to witchcraft.  The film discusses using a knotted cord (a modern witchcraft / Wiccan sigil) to cause male impotence and to prevent pregancy, while lager and wine goblets are dosed with aphrodisiacs.  Numbness of women's backs (a reference to sexual dysfunction) is *stressed* as a sign of demonic possession.  The film discusses the use of flails, spiked belts and spiked collars to purify the endangered soul by scourging the polluted body.  Suspected witches are tortured both to confess their demonic possession and also to identify other witches.  To escape further torture, suspected witches eagerly identify their personal enemies as practicing witches.  ***The use of torture makes witch epidemics a self-fulfilling prophecy.***
""Haxon: ..."" discusses 'The Burning Times' -- the inquisitions where convicted witches were burnt at the stake.  Modern-day witches and Wiccans consider 'The Burning Times' a period of social and religious discrimination.  One explanation for 'The Burning Times' _not_ discussed in ""Haxan: ..."" is that inquisitors viewed peasant and livestock's epileptic-like seizures from eating moist, ergot-infested grain as signs of demonic possession.  Another explanation for 'The Burning Times' more in line with Haxan's sexual emphasis is that embarrassment and insecurity over bad marriages and/or illicit sexual affairs coupled with naive or overambitious inquisitors initiated the witch hunt, then torture-extracted confessions and accusations created the resulting witch emergency.
Daniel Humair's avant garde jazz score helps communicate this macabre film's message.  If one picture is worth a thousand words, then ""Haxan: ..."" is an perceptual encyclopedia concerning witchcraft and demonic possession.",1052611200,5,2589,5.946091644204852

Inform?  He does that quite well.  Chill?  NOT in the original presentation...although the original print is BEAUTIFULLY tinted, and is better-framed than the 1967 reissue, it's the MUSIC that tends to lull me to sleep...the only difference between the 2 versions (note the running times) is the absence of ""narrative titles"" in the 1967 reissue.  The music of the '67 version has been criticized as being ""too jazz, too eclectic,"" but to me, it only adds to the madness of what the director was trying to illustrate!  The scene where two men steal a corpse into their village hut (for experiments) gives me chills in the '67 version...in the ""Swedish Film Institute"" version...it's only a few film segments edited together.

If you watch the original version (which is what I would recommend) the film is told in 7 parts. The first part is explaining the universe with old school pictures of the solar system, then it becomes a documentary about witches and the hysteria in the Middle Ages about accusing innocent people with being in cahoots with the Devil. The music throughout the film is a little off because it's upbeat jazz music while the movie is creepy and grotesque. If you're interested in old school silent horror films about witchcraft, I highly recommend HAXAN!!!",1459555200,2,850,4.598684210526316
