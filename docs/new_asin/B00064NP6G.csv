I truly believe it's captivating and also a sweet, spiritual touching love story. The actors did a great job, and for anyone who enjoys Independent Films, this is the one!",1365120000,,297,4.622641509433962
8038512,5,B00064NP6G,"Richard Barrows (Tab) is my uncle, and is very dear to me.  He showed all of us this movie one night at my gramma's house, and even though I was only 14 at the time, I was intrigued and have never forgotten the movie, even though I've only had the chance to see it once.  I'm very proud of the accomplishments of this movie, and that my uncle had the chance to be a part of it.  Regardless of your age, this movie is thought-provoking and an interesting look into humanity.  The black&white format of the film adds to its originality.  If you haven't seen it, look for it until you find it and have a movie night. :)",1090972800,,616,4.142857142857143
8038513,5,B00064NP6G,"Don Thompson's CLOUDS offers a grand mirror that reflects ones own relation to Life and Love in a beautiful way. The hopeful sincerity with which the physicist Robert St. John searches for the essence of life blends in a paradoxical fashion with the enlightened stillness that already surrounds him. His painful yet promising path towards love and realization is depicted with great realism and the resolution of the story is by no means short of its splendid build-up. I enjoyed a happy and highly elevated state of mind after watching CLOUDS, which is why I recommend the movie as one of the more inspirational works of art available on VHS.",1070064000,3,643,4.8545454545454545
8038514,5,B00064NP6G,I was intrigued by the characters in this movie.  The plot twisted through a labyrinth as the antipacation and mystery kept me guessing.  I recommend this movie to all.,1017100800,4,168,4.758620689655173
