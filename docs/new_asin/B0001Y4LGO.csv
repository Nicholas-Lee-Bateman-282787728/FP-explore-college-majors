8271494,5,B0001Y4LGO,"OVERVIEW OF THE ENTIRE SPIRIT WARRIOR SERIES :

In Japan, the series real name is Kujaku Oh (sometimes spelled ""Kujaku O"" by some people). Kujaku Oh started out as a Manga (which is a Japanese comic book) in 1985 and SOME of the comic issues were adapted for a five part Anime (Japanese made cartoon) movie series which began in 1988 and concluded in 1994 with it's last film (each of the five films are about 50 minutes to one hour each). Over here in the United States (and other parts of the world) the anime series has been renamed.

Over here in the United states (and in some other areas around the world outside of Japan) when the series was released as a five part VHS movie series, Kujaku Oh was called ""Peacock King"" (with Spirit Warrior in smaller letters under the Peacock King name). A few years later, when they released this series as DVDs in the United States, they dropped the ""Peacock King"" name and just called the series ""Spirit Warrior"". The five part VHS series is the SAME thing as the five part DVD series, they are just titled differently.

In all five of the anime movies, as well as the manga (manga are Japanese comic books) the MAIN character and hero to the entire saga is a young man by the name of Kujaku.

Also, just to clear something else up, despite ""Spirit Warrior : Revival of Evil"" being the first released anime movie in the Spirit Warrior series by the company who put this movie series out in the United States, it's actually the FOURTH part. The company in charge of putting this five part series out in the United States totally switched around the order of the movies and made Revival of Evil and Regent of Darkness the first two films released (this is absurd since Revival of Evil and Regent of Darkness are the two FINAL parts of the entire Spirit Warrior / Peacock King anime).

The following is the CORRECT order of the five Spirit Warrior movies :

1) Spirit Warrior : Festival of the Ogres' Revival (despite being the third released film, it's actually part one).

2) Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion (despite being the fourth released film, it's actually part two)

3) Spirit Warrior : A Harvest of Cherry Blossoms (despite being the fifth released film, it's actually part three).

4) Spirit Warrior : Revival of Evil (despite being the first released film, it's actually part four).

5) Spirit Warrior : Regent of Darkness (despite being the second released film, and even being called ""Peacock King : Spirit Warrior 2"" for the earlier VHS release, it's actually part five in the series).

You MUST watch Revival of Evil and Regent of Darkness LAST. If you watch them before the other films, you will be VERY confused later in the series. So make sure you watch the films in the order I listed above.

On a side note, I've watched ALL five movies and enjoyed them ALL. I liked ""Castle of illusion"" a LOT since it cleared up a LOT of things that I was exposed to when I was younger while playing the Sega Genesis game Mystic Defender (that game is based off of ""Spirit Warrior : Castle of illusion""). However, the whole series is a LOT of fun to watch and I recommend the entire five part series.

My favorite Spirit Warrior movie? It's a three way tie. ""Castle of illusion"" and ""the Revival of Evil"" / ""Regent of Darkness"" two-parter (those two films are one big story, so you MUST watch them back to back) are ALL really fantastic.
The other Spirit Warrior film called ""Festival of Ogres' revival"" is also really good. In my opinion, the weakest movie was ""Harvest of Cherry Blossoms"" (it's actually a GOOD movie, but there is a scene in ""Harvest of the Cherry Blossoms"" which seriously bothered me). Overall, ALL five parts are worth watching and I recommend them all.

It should be noted that ALL five of these movies are rated R. These are NOT anime movies for kids. While there is no swearing, there is a LOT of R-rated violence in them (blood, gore, etc). It should also be noted that there is a good amount of nudity in these movies. Granted, some have more nudity than others. Castle of illusion has the most nudity with Harvest of Cherry Blossoms at a close second. The other three films also have nudity, but not as much. It should also be noted that the third movie ""Harvest of Cherry Blossoms"" has a rape scene with nudity in it. Keep this in mind if you are sensitive to that type of stuff.

 Also, there are some mature religious themes present in this series. For example, some of the BAD guys from the film ""Castle of illusion"" read from the accursed bible (Satan's version of the bible) and wear reverse crucifixes (these are Satan's versions of the crucifix where Satan is upside down on a cross, to symbolize his fall from heaven). In case you are wondering, the GOOD guys (like Kujaku) are AGAINST this (so it's not like the series is trying to glorify what the bad guys are doing. It's not).

This series also deals with other types of villains (the Nazis being really good examples) who are pretty damn serious about their agendas and don't care who they have to eliminate in order to get what they want. Kujaku and friends aren't dealing with low level villains in this series. They are up against various types of people (and demons) who are VERY dangerous and have personal agendas they want carried out. Some of the enemies are of the supernatural type while others are just normal humans (which are equally as evil and dangerous).

Overall, ALL five of these movies are really great. Make sure to watch them in the CORRECT order I listed them above.

On a side note, if you are interested in the Spirit Warrior (Peacock King) series in OTHER media, Sega released two video games. The first one is called ""SpellCaster"" for the 8-bit Sega Master System. The second game is called ""Mystic Defender"" for the 16-bit Sega Genesis. While Sega changed the names of the characters in both these games (and censored out several controversial things) they are still Spirit Warrior (Peacock King / Kujaku Oh) games.

If you would like to see LIVE ACTION versions of the Spirit Warrior (Peacock King) series, there is a live action movie called ""Peacock King"". Not as good as the anime (it changes a LOT of things around), but it's okay and worth a watch. There was even a live action sequel called ""Saga of the Phoenix"". It's okay and worth a watch.

As for the manga (the Japanese comic book) it NEVER received an official English translation, which is a shame since it looks awesome.

Anyway, if you like high quality anime, pick up the Spirit Warrior complete series.
It's awesome.",1375574400,5,6557,4.562553191489362

 I Loved the Mysticism of this story that surounds a priest with unique mystical powers to combat (Ogres) demons.

 He is not alone in his strife, his companions are themselves unique in their own abilities and motives.

 To sum up the story line the fight itself throughout the series is one that has existed from the beginning of time.

 The fight between good (evil) and evil but with evil itself fighting for order the neutrality of the world to form balance.

 I feel this sort of storyline and content is itself on its own level i would rate it up there with Cybercity Oedo or something more on the lines of X the movie.",1130803200,4,665,4.377049180327869
