7955924,3,B00005UWA6,"Typical 1950s B-movie nonsense.  PEARL OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC will appeal to fans of Virginia Mayo (whose movies are sadly-lacking on DVD), and anyone who loves a rollicking south seas adventure.

A group of treasure hunters (led by Dennis Morgan and Virginia Mayo) set sail for a mysterious island where rare black pearls have been known to exist.  Mayo goes undercover as a missionary in order to ingratiate herself with the natives, and later has a complete change of conscience when she falls in love.  Don't look for elaborate production values or Oscar-winning screenwriting, just enjoy the movie for what it is.

PEARL OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC is a fun movie, with it's exotic island locales and Virginia Mayo in blazing Technicolor.  The cast also features Murvyn Vye, David Farrar, Lance Fuller, Basil Ruysdael and Lisa Montell.

The DVD currently available from VCI Entertainment is excellent quality for the price, with crisp picture and solid colour (and the reconstructed RKO opening sequence is much-appreciated).  The disc also features a trailer for ""Cattle Queen of Montana"" starring Barbara Stanwyck, also available from VCI.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1202860800,13,1173,5.297297297297297
7955925,4,B00005UWA6,"VCI Entertainment has produced an excellent DVD here. The picture quality is sharp and crisp and the sound is nice and even. The color is excellent. Extras include two vintage Ronald Reagan Western trailers. The Blair team must have used original studio elements to produce this great DVD. There's not one flaw in the master material that I could detect. Now, about the movie itself... it's just a typical 1950's Technicolor South Sea island adventure yarn with beautiful scenery, great sets, and Virgina Mayo in a sarong. But, then, this is my favorite kind of flick... and at a bargain price.",1134691200,12,594,4.891089108910891
7955926,3,B00005UWA6,"This is obviously a budget conscious movie, 98% filmed on a soundstage with a small number of actors with a limited wardrobe (the outdoor shots look like a backlot). This VCI release on DVD has vibrant color and pretty good sound. The plot is predictable and a little cheesy but so what it's got Virgia Mayo one of my absolute favorites, So anything I get to see her in is OK by me. So Far I've had good luck with the DVD quality on all the VCI releases that I've purchased. Thanks.",1051574400,14,482,4.25
