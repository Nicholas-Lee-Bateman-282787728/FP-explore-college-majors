8734691,4,B015UDEMU0,"I saw this movie when I was a kid. Joel McCrea was a big deal back then. When this came out on blu ray, I purchased it and it is still a good solid western. I think the characters sell the movie.  Well worth watching.",1483833600,,217,3.8222222222222224
8734692,5,B015UDEMU0,"This bluray edition, done by Kino Lorber, the same company that did ""Fort Massacre"" with Joel is really good. The HD looks fabulous and if you own a 4K TV with a 4K upscaling Bluray player, you are in for a treat. The picture and sound are just wonderful, better than anything that has been done before in previous releases!
Joel stars as the brother to Ed Masterson. When his brother gets shot in a shootout in Dodge City by a rowdy gang of thugs, he runs in competition for the spot of Sheriff. The current Sheriff, a buffoon and pretty bad Sheriff at that, loses. He then seeks out revenge on Bat and anyone that stands in his way.
Other notable stars of the era in this one are Julie Adams (The Creature From the Black Lagoon, Bend of the River), Sam Jaffe (The Asphalt Jungle), Richard Anderson (The 6 Million Dollar Man, Tora! Tora! Tora!),
** Special Features are 3 Western Trailers also from Kino Lorber",1483056000,2,911,4.428571428571429
