7267180,5,B00YT9IQYU,"Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th was originally released in 2013 as a companion piece of the book of the same name written in 2012 by Peter Bracke. Originally released as a 4-disc set by 1428 films (2 Blu-Ray discs and 2 DVD discs), it went out of print pretty quickly. Lucky for us, Image Entertainment acquired the rights to release it again this year in a very slightly different package.

First of all, the cover art is pretty much the same (although there is now a red ""2-disc Collector's Edition"" banner at the top), and second, this package contains the Blu-Ray discs only and does not included the DVDs. HOWEVER, this version's 2 Blu-Rays have disc art on them in the form of the cover art, whereas the original release, the Blu-Ray discs had a plain red art with the title on them. Nice touch.

Now, why 2 Blu-Ray Discs you ask? Because this thing is nearly SEVEN HOURS LONG. You read that right, SEVEN HOURS. Because of the monstrous length of the documentary, the only special feature you get is a commentary. In all reality though, the ENTIRE PRESENTATION is a special feature (and I do mean special)

The feature is broken down into 14 Chapters, Disc one contains Chapters 1-7 which covers Films 1-6, and one on the Friday the 13th TV series. Disc Two picks right up with Chapters 8-14 covers films 7-8, Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X, Freddy Vs. Jason, the 2009 reboot, and a final chapter titled ""Reflections in the Water,"" where participants give their final thoughts on the series and the ways it has impacted their lives and the fans.

Speaking of participants, the list here is INSANE. Narrated by Corey Feldman, we cover each and every film in the franchise including interviews from Sean S. Cunningham, Frank Mancuso Jr., every single director of the films (excluding Steve Miner) and major cast and crew from every film, literally over 100 interviews. Included is also hundreds of behind-the-scenes photographs, test footage from makeup and sight gags, scenes that were cut from the MPAA, and of course the stories that cast and crew share while making the films, including behind the scenes stories, experiences, accidents on set, reasons why some things turned out they way they did, orignal ideas and concepts, concept art, and some incredible facts that even I didn't know.

Watching the documentary over the course of two evenings, it was informative, incredible, fantastic, and exhausting. It's a trip going from humble low budget beginnings in 1980 all the way to big budget Hollywood, trudging through Crystal Lake to Manhattan, to Hell and back again. Was it worth it? Yes.

As a Friday fan? YES, YES, and YES.

Let's just say I'm strapping on my boots, lighting a fire and listen to them give it to me straight about Jason once again.",1442361600,15,2793,4.758264462809917
7267181,4,B00YT9IQYU,"Clocking in at more than 7 hours in length, ""Crystal Lake Memories"" is a quite comprehensive look at the entire ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, its behind-the-scenes stories, its cultural impact, its highs and lows, its creators, and about the love the fans have for this series.  The documentary is hosted and narrated by actor Corey Feldman, himself a cast member of the 4th film in the series.  Love him or hate him, Feldman does a fine job here.

With the notable exception of actors from the series who have gone on to significant fame (I'm talking to you, Kevin Bacon), almost all the major players from the series are represented here -- actors, directors, screenwriters, and special effects artists.  And almost without exception they look back on their on-set experiences as both a lot of work and a lot of fun.

Fans of the series will enjoy hearing the on-set tales and behind-the-scenes tidbits, not to mention seeing how their favorite installment's actors have aged over the years.  The series is 35 years old as of 2015.

I've had this set for just over a year and I've watched it twice already.  Again, we're talking about a SEVEN HOUR documentary.

Horror movie fans should not pass this one up.",1439078400,20,1209,4.746411483253588
7267222,5,B00YT9IQYU,"This is a fantastic documentary. Even casual fans of the Friday films will probably enjoy this presentation. It's fast paced, but thorough. Hell, at one point they even highlight the Friday the 13th TV series (which had nothing to do with Jason or Camp Crystal Lake). Almost everyone from the films participates, and Corey Feldman narrates the entire feature. Very informative and fun, definitely made by people who deeply love the franchise. 5 stars!",1510444800,,451,5.108108108108108

7267225,3,B00YT9IQYU,"I love Friday the 13th and I'm a huge fan of horror movies in general (mainly the good ones from the 60s-90s). I have the previous documentaries about this franchise so I was really impressed with the content (the inclusion of cast/crew members that weren't in the previous DVDs). However I was disappointed with the quality of the actual DVD. The sound was NOT very good so I was looking forward to being able to watch it with the subtitles; but of course, no subtitles and/or closed captioning! I had to turn the volume up on my TV very loud to be able to hear everything clearly which is very irritating after awhile! I found this kind of odd since the same people who did this also did Never Sleep Again: The Elm St. Legacy, yet that one has closed captioning 
Is anyone else having this issue? Does anyone have subtitles/closed captioning on their DVD or was this a glitch the filmmakers left out? I'd like to know so I can exchange mine please...thanks.",1502236800,,959,4.511494252873563
7267226,5,B00YT9IQYU,"I'm a big fan of the Friday the 13th movies and this documentary answered a lot of questions I wanted to know.

7267313,5,B00YT9IQYU,"If you love the Friday the 13th franchise, then this documentary is a MUST OWN item for your collection!
If you've seen the ""His Name Was Jason"" documentary, ""Crystal Lake Memories"" absolutely obliterates that one. Clocking in at seven hours worth of behind the scenes stories & information & tons of interviews with a ton of the cast & crew, this documentary is jam packed with everything you could possibly want to know about the franchise in it's entirety.
As somebody that deals with ADHD, I find it hard to sit & watch or focus on things for a long period of time. But with this documentary, not once did I find myself straying away from it or losing focus on it what-so-ever. I was enjoying it so much, I watched the whole thing in one night (on Friday the 13th actually too). It keeps you interested, which sometimes is hard for documentaries to do (heck even 90 minute movies have a hard time keeping viewers attentions these days!). But they nailed it & got it right with this one, just like ""Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy"".

If you're a major horror fan or just love the franchise in general & love learning about the films, you must see this or pick this up. It's a must have for sure!",1484524800,12,1207,4.436936936936937

7267318,3,B00YT9IQYU,"I enjoyed this, but it didn't really cover any new ground for me. His Name Is Jason has a lot of the same content, and truth be told, actually has extra features that were enjoyable. This one just seems like a retread.",1481673600,,218,4.214285714285714

I watched it and thought it was pretty good... I saw this one and its really good... Its a little over 3 hours I think. I really cant compare this with ""His Name was Jason"" because it was like 6 years ago when I bought it... and watched it once I think... I will try to watch it soon and compare the 2 of them... Both of them are 2 discs. And this one even talks about the ""Friday the 13th- the series"" the tv show.

I suppose if you get this, you've got too much time on your hands.  Really.

These guys take the ""credit"" for everything it seems and just go on about how wonderful all the films are.  Six hours or so of worthless dung.  I finally got through it after 3 months.  I donated it to charity after.

8719102,5,B00YT9IQYU,"A ComicCon-esque series of interviews which follows Corey Feldman hosting anecdotes from virtually the entrie cast of the movies from the original to the reboot. Generally, the majority of the guests are upbeat and pleasant about their experience--even more so than in the original book where they sometimes took shots at their fellow cast or the movies themselves.

However, while this absence of gossip is unfortunate, Corey does an excellent job of framing each of the movies for newbies who might not have seen every individual episode. It's a six hour documentary and really I don't know if anyone but hardcore Friday fanatics will be interested in it for that much but somehow remains entertaining throughout. I argue this is a much better purchase than trying to read the actual book--which was fun but definitely better experienced in interview format.",1528156800,,860,5.142857142857143
