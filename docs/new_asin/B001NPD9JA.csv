3720474,4,B001NPD9JA,"Have you ever read a book whose characters are so vivid, so alive, so believable that they seemed to step off the page and into your living room?  Or been so submerged in a story, so captivated, so enthralled that you felt as if you had disappeared into it?  Well, if you are a Silver Tongue, it might actually happen.  In the movie INKHEART, there are two such Silver Tongues, people who have the power to read a character right out of a book and into the real world.  But there is a price.  When a character comes out of a book, someone from the real world disappears into it.

Mo and his daughter, Meggie, have been searching for a very rare book for a very long time.  Nine years ago, Mo accidentally read several evil villains out of the book into reality.  Until that fateful night, Mo had no idea of that he possessed this special gift.  Unfortunately, his wife disappeared into the book.  Now, Mo has finally found another copy, and he is desperate to get his wife back.  But what price must he pay this time?

I have not read the very popular INKHEART series of books by Cornelia Funke, but for me, this movie stands on its own and is extremely enjoyable.  The premise is unique and clever, the pacing is just right, and I really had fun with the various characters and creatures from the Wizard of Oz, The Arabian Nights, Peter Pan, Greek mythology, and others popping into our world.  Who among us has not wished that a favorite book could come to life?  Well, if you have the power, they can.  What book would YOU wish for?

The casting and acting in INKHEART is very well done.  Brendan Fraser, who I always enjoy, does a very nice job as Mo - concerned for his daughter, terrified of unleashing more evil into the world, desperate to find his wife.  Helen Mirren is fantastic and funny as Aunt Elinor, the perfect avenger of her odd little family.  The rest of the cast is very pleasant and believable, whether they are from the real world or snatched out of fiction.  Eliza Bennett, who plays Meggie, is delightful and lovely, and Rafi Gavron, one of Ali Baba's Forty Thieves, is very nice to look at.

As I previously stated, I have not read the books, but I do plan to do so.  Never the less, I quite liked this movie; it is a fun and different sort of fantasy.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I must say that my 11 year old daughter, who HAS read the books, is very disappointed.  INKHEART is one of her favorite books, and she did not think the movie matched the book well enough.  My husband, who listened to the INKHEART book on tape, felt that there were too many unnecessary changes, but still thought it was a pretty good movie.

I RECOMMEND INKHEART.  As a stand alone film, it is a very entertaining, unique fantasy.",1233792000,,2745,4.371541501976284
3720475,1,B001NPD9JA,"I hate it when all I can think of while watching any movie is: ""when will it end?"" & ""I could be doing something much more productive with my time!"" Along with constantly hoping it will get better sometime soon!

Inkheart didn't have to be such a boring and dopey mess! There certainly is an interesting premise: A person who reads a story inadvertently has the magical power to bring people and objects from the story into real life. But instead of writing an imaginative story that makes some sense within the world the writer has created, Hollywood choose instead to create a tedious, dumbed-down film that will satisfy no demographic group - be it child, teen or adult!

If you like endless clich&eacute;s, sheer stupidity, mindless threatening, poor editing, cardboard characters, skimping on the special effects, constant frowning & pouting and sheer boredom - then Inkheart is for you!

3720476,4,B001NPD9JA,"Some have criticized ""Inkheart"" for sending the wrong message about reading, as if it was warning children that opening a book will lead to disastrous results. I saw it differently; to me, ""Inkheart"" sends a wonderful message about the imagination of writers and the power they have to create and/or destroy entire worlds. When the forces of evil become overpowering, the writer regains control with a few strokes of a pen (or, more modernly, a few clicks on a keyboard). Far be it from me to want to sound corny, but as a writer myself, I respond well to stories that are about stories. Based on the German novel by Cornelia Funke, ""Inkheart"" is creative and fun, a fantasy about fantasy becoming reality. It tells the story of Mortimer Folchart (Brendan Fraser), a father who possesses the ability to bring forth characters from books simply by reading aloud. But there's a catch: If someone from the story crosses over into our world, then someone from our world has to cross over into the story.

Such a thing happened to Mortimer's beloved wife, Risa, as he was reading from the pages of a novel called ""Inkheart."" Nine years later, he and his twelve-year-old daughter, Meggie (Eliza Bennett), continue to search the world for a copy of that book, which has long since gone out of print. If he can find one, he'll finally be able to read his wife out of the story. He and Meggie finally find one in a quaint bookshop in the middle of Italy. It's there that they run into Dustfinger (Paul Bettany), a juggler who has the ability to start fires with his own hands. As it turns out, he's a character from ""Inkheart,"" and he's spent the last nine years following Mortimer with the hope that he can get him back into the story.

Here enters Mortimer's aunt, Elinor Loredan (Helen Mirren), a snooty bookworm who dresses like Norma Desmond and lives in an isolated sprawling palazzo. She, Mortimer, and Meggie are kidnapped by the henchmen of the evil Capricorn (Andy Serkis), the villain of ""Inkheart."" His dastardly plot: Have Mortimer read aloud from ""Inkheart"" to summon The Shadow, a frightening monstrosity made from smoke and ashes. Capricorn's attempts to bring forth other literary creations have been unsuccessful; his reader, who has the same power as Mortimer, has a terrible stutter. The result is half-materialized creatures, unfinished lines of text written across their bodies. With the help of the author of ""Inkheart"" (Jim Broadbent), one of the Forty Thieves (Rafi Gavron), and a mute scullery maid (Sienna Guillory), Mortimer and Meggie set forth on a quest to restore everything to the way it's supposed to be.

The magic of this movie comes not from the digital effects or the elaborate settings, although both are quite impressive. It comes from the clever plot, the wonderful use of imagination, and characterization. This isn't to suggest that the characters are any more than fairy tale archetypes; heroes, villains, damsels in distress, wise elders, and comedy relief all contribute to the story in one form or another. Still, there's a complexity to certain characters that makes them more engaging. Take, for example, Dustfinger--he's a decent enough person at heart, but his circumstances often times lead him down a desperate, sometimes cowardly path. His only motivation is to return within the pages of ""Inkheart"" to be with his family (his wife, Roxanne, is seen only in brief glimpses and is played by Bettany's real-life wife, Jennifer Connelly). And the fact that he's afraid to meet the book's author made perfect sense; Dustfinger has never read ""Inkheart"" all the way through because he doesn't want to know his fate. When Meggie asks him why, he responds, ""Do you know how your story ends?""

I also appreciated the references made to well-known works of fiction, most notably L. Frank Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"" which plays a very important role midway through the film, when the good guys attempt to escape from Capricorn's castle. I love the idea that a written fantasy could be freed from the page and used as a weapon against the forces of evil. It makes for a level of excitement I rarely feel. What's even more exciting is the fact that the exact same forces of evil can also use the written word as a weapon; at that point, survival depends on being able to expand on the author's original vision. To say more would give too much away, but rest assured that anyone able to appreciate the act of writing will find the ending of ""Inkheart"" very satisfying.

I will not go so far as to say that it's an original story. I will say, however, that it works with what it has got very well. It's always a pleasure to see a film that appreciates the art of storytelling, which I personally feel is one of the greatest gifts we as people can share with one another. I have so much respect for writers; they create entire worlds and inhabit them with characters that are not always relatable, but are usually fascinating just the same. Not all will agree, but I feel that ""Inkheart"" is a film that celebrates the author and the worlds he or she creates. It's a pure delight from beginning to end, fun, exciting, and magical--exactly what I wanted to see.",1232928000,40,5199,4.765815760266371
3720477,2,B001NPD9JA,As a fan of Brandon Frasier I was extremley disapointed at the incredible slow pace this movie was delivered.  Any action sequences at all were few and fleeting.  One of the dullest adventure stories ever delivered to the big screen.  1 46 min movie felt like it was 3 hrs +  I personally couldn't wait for it to end.,1232755200,,317,4.322033898305085
3720478,4,B001NPD9JA,"This movie has been slammed by the critics.  One claimed that the movie was so bad that he would not consider reading the other two books.  I find it a bit strange to assert that because a movie was not spectacular, the book must be bad.  The book series is absolutely wonderful, so do not let the reviews of the movie in any way dissuade you from reading the books.

My family loves the Inkheart series.  We went to see the movie today, and found it acceptable, not fantastic, but decent and not deserving of the hugely negative reviews it has been garnering.

 Perhaps one has to have read the series to ""get"" the movie, certainly it would help a great deal.  The premise is fairly complex and movies are not necessary designed to bring  tangled and detailed stories to life. None of us likes when the story line is changed, and we feel that that particular problem occurred a little more than it should have in the film (trying not to give anything away here).

But the general premise of the story was present in the movie, and the special effects are well done.  I especially like that Meg, the main character, is not a wimpy whining girl.  She thinks and acts for herself.  The acting was good, and the movie was enjoyable.  Not a home run perhaps, but a decent family movie.  I would not take very small children (say under age 8 or so) for two reasons, it is a bit scary and the plot line would be very difficult for them to follow.",1232755200,4,1440,4.340823970037453
3720479,4,B001NPD9JA,"Have you ever become so immersed in a book that it seemed to come to life?

Suppose it really did. That premise underlies this enchanted fantasy story. I have to admit, the movie's basic passion for the written word spoke to something inside me. So did the libraries of whispering books, which brought to life something that had only been metaphorically real for me before, and so did the girl with her own zeal for reading and aspirations toward writing. On top of that, I was somewhat tickled to see the best of today's movie making effect-meisters putting so much effort into this tribute to the low tech pleasure of reading.

Given that magical beginning, the story might have become more - but drew me along anyway. The characters never wholly engaged me, though. Even Helen Mirren couldn't quite give her character the drive I might have hoped for. In truth, I was happy to see the effects kick in toward the second half of the movie, to give me visually what the plot wasn't offering.

I confess, I haven't read the book. It seems to have a loyal following, and loyal readers often express disappointment in how their favored scenes and characters appear on the screen. I had the luxury of judging the movie on its own merits, so I generally enjoyed it. Although a bit much for skittish small children, it's a kid-friendly fantasy - and one that works against the view that reading is for nerds.

3720480,3,B001NPD9JA,"Based on Cornelia Funke's novel, Inkheart presents a supremely fascinating concept with limitless possibilities - unfortunately the direction it takes falls into the predictable realm of formulaic fantasy (it's as if a quota must be reached for daring escapes, rescue attempts and damsels in distress). The basic plot is as convoluted and faulty as time travel, and without very finite ground rules, the details and conclusion feel contrived - unnaturally forced in order to neatly right the predicaments. Several characters are wasted and the most adventurous avenues are left completely unexplored, but for a fun-filled fantasy film Inkheart isn't entirely a letdown. First-rate special effects and well-paced action put this inventive picture well above the utter failures of Eragon or The Seeker.

Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart (Brendan Fraser) has a rare magical gift that allows him to bring to life anything he reads out loud from a book. It's more complicated than it sounds - when he reads aloud, the elements in each passage are transported into his current location, as if directly from the world defined in the book, and someone from his own time is sent into the book in exchange. This implies that every written story must create an environment that exists on a unique timeline, and that those creations exist somewhere in three dimensions. Further confusion is introduced when one of the characters Mo brings to life (or rather out of the book's life) worries about how his story will end, hinting that each book also has a timeline concurrent with present time - and later that the characters in books can change the course of their destiny, even though it's cemented in unchanging printed words.

Mo's troubles start because he is unaware he has such an ability (humans with this skill are known as Silvertongues). He reads the story of Inkheart to his young daughter and wife, unleashing the dastardly villain Capricorn (Andy Serkis), along with the roguish fire-juggling Dustfinger (Paul Bettany). Mo's wife vanishes and Capricorn sets about building himself an army of storybook henchmen. Mo vows never to read another book out loud and so twelve years pass without incident. His daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) has grown up and wonders about Mo's obsessive quest to obtain another copy of the Inkheart book to try and correct his decade-old error. When he finally finds another copy in an antiquarian bookshop, Dustfinger reappears, begging the Silvertongue to return him to his world; when Mo refuses, the ilk of Capricorn is summoned to force compliance.

There are well-intentioned themes (involving the power of reading and writing among others) floating around in the story of Inkheart, but the film fails to fully illustrate the creativity of the major concepts. The villains are of course unthreatening (this is a kid's movie after all), Helen Mirren's supporting role is wasted, and each of the characters is designed in the most generic manner. For a plot that is already incredibly outlandish and difficult to accept, it's odd to cast Brendan Fraser, who brings an instant air of goofiness and tongue-in-cheek humor to a character that would have been more effective if played seriously.

In one scene a Silvertongue is forced to read out of various books to prove her skill; as the camera pans across the room the audience can see Cinderella's glass slipper, Huckleberry Finn's raft, a gingerbread house from Hansel and Gretel, the Sword in the Stone and many more recognizable storybook entities. It's at this moment, with countless novels at the creator's disposal, that we acknowledge the biggest disappointment: imagining what could have been. What an amazingly unique concept with such mediocre execution.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: INKHEART [2008] finds Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart [Brendan Fraser] and his 12-year-old daughter, Meggie Folchart [Eliza Hope Bennett], share a passion for books. What they also share is an extraordinary gift for bringing characters from books to life when they read aloud. But there is a danger: when a character is brought to life from a book, a real person disappears into its pages.

On one of their trips to a second-hand book shop, Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart hears voices he hasn't heard for years, and when he locates the book they are coming from, it starts a chain of events that no one knows at the time what the outcome will be and hopefully , Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart  will solve these problems more swiftly so that he can find and save his beloved wife and gets her back into the real world and eventually get everything back to how it was in the real world and send people back into the fantasy world of the Inkheart book. The fantasy Inkheart book is filled with lots of illustrations of medieval castles and strange creatures and a book he has been searching for since Meggie Folchart was three years old, when her mother, Teresa ""Resa"" Folchart [Sienna Guillory] vanished into its mystical fantasy world.

But Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart's plan to use the book to find and rescue Teresa ""Resa"" Folchart is thwarted when Capricorn [Andy  Serkis], the evil villain of the rare book Inkheart and kidnaps Meggie Folchart and discovering she has inherited her father's gift, demands that she bring his most powerful ally to life and The Shadow [Marnix Van Den Broeke]. Determined to rescue his daughter and send the fictional characters back where they belong, Mo assembles a small group of friends and family and some from the real world, some from the pages of books and embarks on a daring and perilous journey to set things right.

Cheeky visual references to classic childrens books, like the flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz and the ticking croc from Peter Pan are among the creatures we get to see and keep the fantasy film is very engaging and gives great homage to its attitude towards the literature world. Visually, the film is totally impressively crafted in all respects all round, with lush widescreen views of coastal Italy and splendid palatial interiors by set designer-decorator Niamh Coulter and production designer John Beard. Eliza Hope Bennett is spirited and watchable as a girl who must ultimately draw on her own imaginative power to save the day, and Jim Broadbent is in reliable fuddy-duddy form as Fenoglio, the author of the novel within the novel. Dame Helen Mirren as the eccentric Elinor Loredan gives a performance so good and so right for the material when the actress appears on screen and her introductory scene in a storybook mansion on the banks of Lake Como is a master class in comic timing. Paul Bettany and Andy Serkis, in a rare non-motion capture role. The film has a handsome look due to the art direction by Rod McLean and Stuart Rose and the cinematography of Roger Pratt.  There are wonderful touches of whimsy in the corners of the frame when you look for them and there is a mix of visual effects from the stunning to total silliness. It is definitely worth a look and it will appeal to children who love the fantastical fantasy film of this calibre.

Blu-ray Video Quality  New Line Cinema and Entertainment in Video brings this Blu-ray disc with a totally stunning 1080p image presentation and is enhanced with the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. At times I was blown away by the brilliant colours and crispness of some of the shots and mostly with the ending of the film looks totally amazing. But was also outstanding is when the camera glides over mountaintops and swoops into medieval alleyways and it's all very stylish and gives the film some very luxurious golden, autumnal palette and the colours seem to feel like they pop out of the screen. There is an abundance of fine detail, in setting and costume, and these are fully realised to be very crisp and well defined. Then, once things get going, the transfer goes big time.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2008] [1080i] [1.37:1] [13:36] Here we get to view a number of deleted scenes that were left on the cutting room floor, and many of them are apparently taken directly from the pages of the book written by Cornelia Funke and were left out for some reason and here what you get to view the following: Opening: Mos House; Alpine Village Sled Chase; Mos Flashback of Resa and Meggie at Book Fair; Library; Capricorns Chambers; Contryside; Fenoglios Place; Basta and Mortola Confront the Reunited Family and Hillside Reunion. As usual you, you can either watch them individually or Play All.

Special Feature: Eliza Reads to Us [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [3:46] Here we are introduce to the Novelist Cornelia Funke explaining what we are about to view relating to her book in relation to the film with its characters and then we get to see the young actress Eliza Hope Bennett who plays Maggie in the film, reads a passage from the original Cornelia Funke Inkheart book that was left out of the film. The passage Eliza Hope Bennett states it is one of her favourite passage from the book, and discusses what happens to the main characters after the dramatic ending in the film. It is a nice piece, and Eliza Hope Bennett does a great job of reading the passage from the book. Apparently Cornelia Funke enjoys it when people read from her books out loud, which is probably why this is included as an extra.

Finally, with the film INKHEART [2008] it is all about the adventure fantasy starring Brendan Fraser, Paul Bettany and Eliza Hope Bennett, that is based on a best-selling young-adult novel written by Cornelia Funke, who is a German author who not only based her protagonist on Brendan Fraser, she dedicated the book's follow-up to him. The film INKHEART has a great deal of potential, and it is a fantastic fantasy magical film that will of course be compared to the franchise films of Narnia and Harry Potter. There were really good acting performances and some well over the top throughout the film and of course features fantastic special effects that I know all generations will really enjoy and especially seeing Academy Award Winners Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent, interpreting the pages of the Cornelia Funkes bestselling book, to the silver screen. Highly Recommended!

An absolutely wonderful,  beautiful movie!  Great story,  great actors and definitely a good movie to watch for families.

We didn't even know Brendan Fraser starred in a movie adaptation of the book.  Well, as always, while searching for a movie to watch from those available through Amazon's instant video, we were delighted to see Inkheart, the movie.  The film adaptation is a little different from what we imagined while reading the book.  However, the film also added to the richness of the book.  Overall, we had a great time viewing this film, and we have decided to keep a digital copy for ourselves.

I highly recommend this to those who are fans of the book.  We weren't disappointed, and hope you won't be, as well.",1460937600,6,725,4.523076923076923

3720729,5,B001NPD9JA,"I entered this movie like I enter the books I read...patiently, with excitement, waiting for a story to unfold and enfold me.  This movie fit the bill.  I bought the Cornelia Funke novel for $1 at a garage sale, and about a hundred pages in, I knew I had to see the movie.  I expected very little, and received a lot.  I'm confused by the reviewers who say that the plot concept ""doesn't make sense.""  Well, if sense for you means Donald Trump running for president and Kim Kardashian being a role model, then I guess it wouldn't.  The logic of fantasy is being swept up in a tornado, or lost in a labyrinth with a dangerous mutant monster....it's the world of ""What If.""  What if you read a book aloud, and the characters actually came out of it?  That's the premise, that's the sense of it -- the imagination.  Very much in the line of The Neverending Story which I bought in an airport to read on a flight and fell in love with.  Flight?  What flight?  I was immersed.  With an amazingly brilliant cast...watch for Jennifer Connelly in a small but significant role...she says more with one look from her eyes than most can with ten thousand words.  Brendan Fraser is good as the confused, angry, guilt-ridden father...best role I've seen him in since Monkeybones.  Helen Mirren is sheer delight as Elinor, the crotchety book loving great aunt.  Andy Serkis...pure genius.  The rest of the cast keeps up the pace as well.  Maybe not of the same caliber as say, Pan's Labyrinth, but damned close.",1438992000,,1497,4.543071161048689

Like How To Train Your Dragon by DreamWorks, it didn't exactly follow the book but it was insanely incredible and enjoyable. Inkheart was the same!

3720871,2,B001NPD9JA,"Inkheart

The popular Brendan Fraser proves for the nth time that he is not Richard Burton, as if we care.  Inkheart is a typical Fraser vehicle, heavy on action, light on character or plot.  It is in fact light on anything that we wish for when we pay our money at the ticket window of our favorite movie house.
 This is a childrens fantasy movie, which is fine.  It seems to be aimed at 10 year old females, which is also fine.  It just doesn't intrigue us; it never captures our attention to any acceptable degree.  The characters are too plentiful and too thin for us to care very much about their ultimate fate.  Dustfinger, a displaced fire juggler, is at once the best developed and the least appealing of the characters.  When he receives his desserts, we don't even care much about it.  The rest of the characters have less than the life and vitality of shadow puppets.
 It is no compliment to a film to say that the flying monkeys are about the best thing in the movie.  The special effects are good.  The film itself is quite pretty in many parts.  But the story is busy without being enthralling.
 This one hour 46  minute PG (for some scary events-no bad words or naked people) rated movie debuted at an appalling seventh place.  The people have spoken.  Sometimes the public has a sixth sense when it comes to shelling out the long green for a ticket.  Inkheart brought in a slight $7 million over its opening weekend.
 Director Iain Softly was responsible for the interesting K-PAX in the past.  That film will not be challenged as his most successful effort by Inkheart.

It is safe for kids, and it seems like that's getting harder and harder to find these days.  I wanted so much for it to be great,, and it just wasn't.

Bottom line - Rent it.",1410134400,,333,3.8676470588235294

3720940,5,B001NPD9JA,"Ok - just as a warning this review is coming from someone who did not read the book. With that said this is a wonderful film. It has great performances by both Helen Miren, Brendan Frasier, and Andy Serkis. The film revolves around a man who can read aloud so well, that characters from books will come out of them. As a result, a character from the book Inkheart has kidnapped his wife. He makes it his mission to find the book again and rescue her. Other books are brought into the film including Tom Sawyer, The Wizard of Oz, and One Thousand and One Arabian Nights. The film's best point is that it makes the viewer want to pick up a book and read after you watch it. It is very rare to find a film that advocates books like this one.",1408579200,,738,4.1678321678321675

3720949,5,B001NPD9JA,"This is an excellent movie for the family to enjoy! It has a great storyline, and the acting is very well-done.

If you are not familiar with the storyline, Mo (Brendan Fraser) has the ability to make the books that he reads come to life. This endangers the life of his daughter Meggie, their odd-ball assortment of friends (including Jim Broadbent as a bumbling writer), and himself when the villain Capricorn (played by none other than Andy Serkis!) wants to exploit Mo's gift for his own evil designs. (I mean what evil villain doesn't?)

The story is fun as it incorporates many beloved classics, such as The Wizard of Oz, Arabian Nights, Peter Pan, Rapunzel, and many other favorites. Definitely a movie worth watching.",1405641600,,724,4.830645161290323

I thought Helen Mirren and Andy Serkis was excellent, but the story just didn't sit well with the intended audience.

If you're a fan of this book series, don't go into it with high expectations. I was in such disbelief that I sat and watched the whole thing, saying, 'it's going to get better soon.' Honestly, had I not read the books, I probably would have enjoyed it a bit more. I like Brendon Fraser and all, but he was not the actor for the part of Mo.

I was happily surprised that the acting wasn't too awful and that the special effects were done very well.  The movie of course didn't follow the book verbatim but I think did a great job of adapting to film.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought Brendan Fraser was poorly cast and his character wasn't believe for me.",1391212800,,554,4.465346534653466

3721255,4,B001NPD9JA,"The only reason I gave it four stars is because the whole series was wrapped up in one movie and my children and I agree, we'd have liked to have seen more of these books made into movies.

This is an excellent book and the movie is very good. The movie closely follows the book until near the end. There are some noticeable differences between the two but not enough that it takes away from the enjoyment of the movie. But for those of you who want the movie to be exactly like the book, you will want to be aware that there are some minor changes in the movie.

The plot is excellent.
The themes are complex.
The characters are complex and true to the characters in the book. Meggie looked exactly like we thought she should.
The actors fit together and did a great job.

Overall, this is the type of movie I encourage my children to watch when they feel the must watch something.

Well worth the money.

3721300,2,B001NPD9JA,"The things I watch for Brendan Fraser....well, I read the first book and just a few pages of the 2nd book in this trilogy. Did not like them at all,  waste of time at any age. I had hopes that the screenwriters might be able to salvage the book as they transitioned it to to the big screen. There was a little improvement, but not enough. Due to the original book story line being so convoluted and ambiguous,the movie just carried on that style, just not so intensely. Acting was good, actors/actresses did well with what they had to work with(and how can you not like Brendan Fraser?). Even I had not read the book first I'd still have been left with such a sense of what the heck is going on. Very confusing. A lot of things were just not clear. What was left out from the book would have made it a bit clearer, but when you try to make material that was not very good to start with, it is almost impossible to make it anything of quality. So, yeah, it was a bust.....too bad.",1370995200,,979,4.207446808510638
3721301,3,B001NPD9JA,"I know I sure do. Movies like Arabian Nights, Stardust, the Neverending story. For those of you who read the book (I did, the whole series) you will be sorely disappointed. If in fact you're like me, by the end of it you'll be thinking how one day you should become a director to remake this devastating mistake. It's okay to watch occasionally, or once just after you buy it. The acting was good, however it somehow fell short which is why I gave it three stars, because like I said i'm the kind who loves cheesey effects. A remake that crossed James Cameron (Avatar) and Tim Burton style with some  J.J. Abrams action would be great.

3721383,1,B001NPD9JA,"Let me say this up front: I pretty-much hated this movie. I have never read the books and I don't plan to after seeing the movie. That being said, my review is a bit of a rant, though I bear no ill will to anyone, including the film makers.

With that out of the way, let's get down to business. Inkheart was a terrible movie, mostly due to its ridiculous premise. The premise is that there are some people in the world who have the power read things from books into reality. Cool right? Wrong, because there's a catch: everytime you read something in, something from our world goes into the story world. To top it off, the readers with this power have no control over who comes in or goes out. This means that they cannot read any work of fiction out-loud with out characters popping in and loved-ones popping out. Poor Mortimer Folchart has this exact situation thrust upon him: one night, he read a villain from the book Inkheart into our world and his wife disappeared into the book. The movie, also called Inkheart, tells of his quest to find another copy of the book so that he can read his wife back in. Accompanied by his annoying daughter, he takes a mostly pointless journey and ultimately succeeds in getting back his wife.

As a variant of the fantasy genre, the movie has potential but its execution falls flat. Much of the narrative is messy; I spent a decent amount of time confused about what was going on. The action scenes are weak and poorly executed and I had little investment in any of the characters except for Dustfinger, a magician who is desperately trying to get back into his book. The modern setting was a bit of a mismatch; it would have fit better in a medieval setting because the juxtaposition of the fantasy elements with the modern ones was not very good. The film's ensemble cast, which incudes the likes of Brendan Fraser, Andy Serkis, Paul Bettany, and Helen Mirren is mostly wasted.

But the ultimate reason why I hated this film was the climax. *SPOILER ALERT* Remember how those special readers can make books into reality? Well turns out that it works with anything that they read, including their own writing, which means that if they write anything down and read it out loud, it becomes reality. And guess who figures this out and learns to control it? The incredibly annoying daughter. (In her own defense, I think she was supposed to be annoying. If so, she deserves an Oscar.) In a horribly messy climax, she wraps up the entire plot, sending every character back to their respective books and defeating every villain, simply by reading her own writing. To say the least, I was abhorred. The power went from reading people in and out of books by accident, to near-omnipotence where this girl literally speaks and things are created. There was also no explanation for why nobody was accidentally read into any stories there at the end. It's like the writers were changing the rules of the story as they went and to place the fate of every character into the hands of an annoying little girl!? What a tragedy. I was honestly offended at the end as I asked myself, ""How stupid do they think we are?""

I honestly had high hopes for Inkheart. The cast was diverse and acclaimed, and the story sounded very promising. But after watching the film, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.",1361145600,,3328,4.578859060402684

3721427,2,B001NPD9JA,"Recently watched movie review:
*Inkheart (2008)- 2.5/5

Inkheart is a fantasy/family film and it is based on the novel of the same name by Cornelia Funke. Mortimer Folchart (Brendan Fraser) doesn't know it yet, but he possesses storytelling skills which gives him the power to transport the book characters into the real world. One night when Mortimer reads a bedtime story (Inkheart) to his baby daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett), a character pops out from the book, and when someone comes out of the book, someone from the real world must go back in to take that characters spot. His wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory) is the 'someone' who gets transported to the book world and it's now up to Mortimer, his 'now' 12-year-old daughter, and book characters to find a copy of 'Inkheart' to bring Resa back to the real world.

The premise of Inkheart should be rewarding to the viewer, but it's not, it's actually a disappointment. There's no momentum, the climax is lame, and the film feels limited to what it can do when in fact it could have been so much more. There's a nice 'Wizard of Oz' element that's incorporated into the film, but that just left me wanting more characters and themes from other novels. Inkheart has a quality cast, and it shows. Kids will mildly like it and adults will tolerate it, but one can't help but feel disappointed after watching it. Inkheart gets a mild recommended 'rent.'",1353628800,,1401,4.761316872427984
3721428,1,B001NPD9JA,"I hate it when all I can think of while watching any movie is: ""when will it end?"" & ""I could be doing something much more productive with my time!"" Along with constantly hoping it will get better sometime soon!

Inkheart didn't have to be such a boring and dopey mess! There certainly is an interesting premise: A person who reads a story inadvertently has the magical power to bring people and objects from the story into real life. But instead of writing an imaginative story that makes some sense within the world the writer has created, Hollywood choose instead to create a tedious, dumbed-down film that will satisfy no demographic group - be it child, teen or adult!

If you like endless clichs, sheer stupidity, mindless threatening, poor editing, cardboard characters, skimping on the special effects, constant frowning & pouting and sheer boredom - then Inkheart is for you!",1351987200,,884,4.886666666666667
3721439,4,B001NPD9JA,"No it isn't ""sophisticated"". No, it isn't graphically overwhelming like Avatar.

Yes it is a satisfying story with believable characters that have logical reasons for what they do. There is a magical power held by certain people called ""silver tongues"" who can make things appear out of a book, when they read aloud. This sets the story off and drives it to conclusion.

Thankfully, it is NOT a sword and sorcery, or a witchcraft-is-good kind of story. It's original.

Special effects were appropriate and useful to the story, but do not dominate it. Your imagination helps drive it - everything isn't put on screen for you to absorb. I liked that.

It's kind of intense for younger kids, and would scare them. There are some mean, violent bad people who kidnap and threaten the main characters - pretty convincing thugs. Ugly, too.

I don't think it got the publicity it deserves, but then it lacks wizards, bikini clad damsels, spellcasting, dragons, duels, vampires, and bloodshed. It's a modern make believe with some humorous moments, and I recommend it as a family film.",1351814400,6,1076,4.8901098901098905

3721442,4,B001NPD9JA,"Have you ever become so immersed in a book that it seemed to come to life?

Suppose it really did. That premise underlies this enchanted fantasy story. I have to admit, the movie's basic passion for the written word spoke to something inside me. So did the libraries of whispering books, which brought to life something that had only been metaphorically real for me before, and so did the girl with her own zeal for reading and aspirations toward writing. On top of that, I was somewhat tickled to see the best of today's movie making effect-meisters putting so much effort into this tribute to the low tech pleasure of reading.

Given that magical beginning, the story might have become more - but drew me along anyway. The characters never wholly engaged me, though. Even Helen Mirren couldn't quite give her character the drive I might have hoped for. In truth, I was happy to see the effects kick in toward the second half of the movie, to give me visually what the plot wasn't offering.

I confess, I haven't read the book. It seems to have a loyal following, and loyal readers often express disappointment in how their favored scenes and characters appear on the screen. I had the luxury of judging the movie on its own merits, so I generally enjoyed it. Although a bit much for skittish small children, it's a kid-friendly fantasy - and one that works against the view that reading is for nerds.

3721447,4,B001NPD9JA,"I have a seven-year-old who loves reading and has an active imagination. I had heard of Cornelia Funke's Inkheart trilogy of books but had not watched the film adaptation of the novel until today. I saw the DVD at our local library and decided my daughter and I would watch it this lazy Sunday evening, and we both enjoyed it immensely.

Inkheart tells the story of a young tween, Meggie (Eliza Bennett) whose life changes when she discovers her dad, Mo (Brendan Fraser) a quiet, unassuming bookbinder, is a Silvertongue who has the amazing ability to bring characters in books alive when he reads aloud. When Meggie was three years old, Mo read out loud from a book titled Inkheart and this caused Meggie's mother to be sucked into the book. It also had the unfortunate effect of causing several villains from the story to come out into the real world.

Fast forward nine years later - Mo has been searching for a copy of Inkheart and finally finds it only to be betrayed to one of the villains by a man desperate to return to the world within the book himself. Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) yearns to be reunited with his wife (played in a cameo by Jennifer Connelly) and his young daughter, and turns in Mo to the villain Capricorn who wishes to continue living in the real world without any threat of being sent back to the world of Inkheart.

The ensemble cast delivers strong performances that make this movie an above-average watch - particularly commendable are Paul Bettany's performance as the tormented Dustfinger and Hellen Mirren's portrayal of Meggie's aunt.

The story moves quickly and there are plenty of tense sequences though nothing too graphic or violent until the finale where a CGI monster with flaming eyes appears (this might be too scary for the under fives).

This makes for great family entertainment and the story is one that will appeal to children with active imaginations and booklovers.",1338681600,2,1915,4.7734138972809665
3721448,4,B001NPD9JA,"I had fun watching this movie; I was able to fully accept the basic assumptions of the movie and enjoyed an action filled fantasy ride with beautiful scenery thrown in as a bonus. If you are a fan of family friendly fantasy you'll need to be sure and watch this one. It has a story line that reminded me somewhat of Jumanji where imaginary fantasy characters came to life as one played a game whereas in Inkheart the fantasy characters came to life when a specially gifted (or cursed) individual simply read the words from a book out loud.

The story is about the adventures that follow when the father in the story discovers he has that strange gift and unintentionally sets in motion a series of unwelcome events including the sudden disappearance of his wife.  His reading draws a group of suitably villainous villains from fantasy to reality who found their lot was much improved in their new situation and decided to take advantage of it. The father, played by Brendan Fraser, and the daughter, played by Eliza Bennett are suitably innocent and charming to garner the sympathetic support of the viewer.

If you can abandon reason and logic and permit yourself to be carried along by a fanciful story, you may well enjoy this one as much as I did.",1338076800,6,1251,4.626126126126126
3721459,4,B001NPD9JA,"Mo Folchart (Brendon Fraser) is a ""Silvertongue,"" a person who can make storybook characters come alive by reading aloud. Really. Literally. But he didn't even know it until one night he reads a bedtime story to his daughter and things started to appear. I won't go into details, but the basic premise is that once these characters appear in the same world as the Silvertongue, they have free will and can do what they like, but someone from his world must go to the book's world to ""balance things out.""

Well, OK, it's a fantasy. But it's an interesting premise, and the plot is pretty consistent within the premises of the story. The book he had been reading the night his wife disappeared was called ""Inkheart."" So ever since then, he's been going to bookstores looking for another copy. He's a bookbinder by trade, so it works out as a good cover story.

Rather than give away the story, let me tell you about the most interesting characters.

Meggie Folchart (Eliza Bernett) is Mo's daughter, 12 at the time of the main action of the story. She knows something is strange, because her father will never talk about her mother's disappearance, they travel around to antiquarian bookstores all over Europe, and she's never been in a regular school. She turns out to be a pretty special kid on several levels.

Elinor Loredan (Helen Mirren) is Mo's book lover aunt, Meggie's great aunt. They go to visit her and she gives Meggie her mother's copy of ""The Wizard of Oz."" She's a demanding, crusty old thing, but turns out pretty wonderful when Mo and Meggie need her help.

Dustfinger (Paul Bettany) is one of the characters that Mo ""read out"" of ""Inkheart."" He's been stalking Mo as he searches for another copy, because he wants Mo to ""read him back"" to his home. He has a quite marvelous ferret for a traveling companion.

Farid (Rafi Gavron) is a young character from ""Arabian Nights"" that was ""read out"" when the villain from Inkheart forces Mo to read it for the 40 thieves' treasure. He's brave and resourceful, attaches himself to Dustfinger because he wants to learn fire magic from him, and it quite attractive. He, in turn, concludes that Meggie is quite attractive.

It's a fun adventure, would be great to share with kids old enough to not be frightened by monsters like the Minotaur and flying monkeys.",1336780800,2,2317,4.692118226600985

The overall idea is very original and quite good.  There are a lot of unusual characters and the plot is fun.  The idea is that the ""silver tongues"" can read object and people out of stories.  Unfortunately, the novel inkheart has some bad characters in it that Brendan Fraser's character reads out and his wife gets sucked into the book in exchange.  OK, the premise is obviously fictional but fun.  At the end, suddenly everything changes . . . spoiler alert coming next . . . and Brendan's daughter who is also a silvertongue can suddenly write anything she wants on her arm and therefore ""writes"" the happy ending; bringing the story to a crashing and abrupt halt that makes no sense.  Wouldn't Brendan Fraser's character have tried that?  Wouldn't the bad guy have tried that with his other silver tongue guy?  Just write for whatever he wants?  They set the story up to be a chase for the last few copies of Inkheart and then at the end change everything to say you don't need those at all, all you need is a girl with a pen and some skin?

The only decent book to films I have seen are the Lord of the rings and Harry Potter.

3721501,3,B001NPD9JA,"`Inkheart' is a pretty decent fantasy adventure about a man (called a Silvertongue) who can read books aloud and make then come alive. He did exactly this many years ago and lost his wife into a book, whilst setting some rather unsavoury characters free. As you can imagine this would lead to many adventures and how they are resolved is where this film leads. There are numerous literary references throughout this film, from Peter Pan to The Wizard of Oz, Huckleberry Finn to The Minotaur and more besides and this aspect makes the film more magical as the main characters interact with characters from classic fiction of the past. Andy Serkis plays an excellent baddie and the strong fantasy elements make the battle between good and evil all the more potent. Having not read the original book I came to his film with no preconceptions and also had the luxury of not being disappointed by any changes to the storyline. As a stand alone film this makes good viewing and just over 100 minutes of fantasy adventure suitable for all the family. I have seen better fantasy films (`Stardust' being one of them) but this still isn't bad and it is a good way to spend an afternoon. Worth a viewing.

3721503,2,B001NPD9JA,"Inkheart is a meticulously crafted and inventive book that celebrates the power and beauty of the written word.

I generally prefer reading a book myself to listening to an audiobook.  It's relatively unusual that the audio treatment adds enough interest to balance out the additional time that a read-aloud takes.  However, Inkheart is a book in which reading aloud is a pivotal theme; and the audiobook, narrated flawlessly by the late Lynn Redgrave, parlays that connection into a listening experience that not only matches but exceeds the experience of reading the book oneself.

In contrast, this movie takes the whole experience in the opposite direction.  The story is condensed and rushed, and the viewing experience is chaotic and overstimulating.  I wouldn't say it's unpleasant to watch; it's just a waste of a unique piece of children's/YA literature that has so much more to offer.  There's plenty of ""magic,"" of the cheap movie thrills variety, but the true magic of Cornelia Funke's storytelling is abandoned in favor of fast-paced yet unremarkable action. Watching this first will ruin the experience one could have had with the book and/or the audiobook; and watching it after will just be disappointing.  Don't bother.

3721521,3,B001NPD9JA,"This is quite a nice movie. It just isn't all that it could have been. The premise that by reading a book aloud the characters can come to life is an engaging fantasy. I don't accept at all the suggestion that this might put children off reading- in fact, I'm sure many children would love to have this power. The characters are not realistic, of course, but they're not meant to be. These are fairytale people and behave as such. The movie moves along pretty well and has a good climax. It's certainly worth watching, for those who enjoy the fantasy genre.

Where the movie falls short, in my view, is that too many of the scenes and characters aren't developed as they could have been. Instead, there are rather too many similar scenes; lots of chases and hiding from the bad guys, for example. Having assembled a very strong cast, the screenwriter and director waste their talents by simply not giving them enough to do. Helen Mirren's Great Aunt Elinor is splendidly dotty, ascerbic and adventurous, but she never actually accomplishes anything and at the end of the movie I was left feeling that somehow the reason for her character existing had been left out. Similarly with Jim Broadbent, who as the author of the fantasy book Inkheart should have had more to contribute than finding the original manuscript among his old files. The only characters who really captured the spirit of the story were Paul Bettany's Dustfinger and Andy Serkis' wonderful villain, Capricorn. Their characters were given something tangible to contribute and the two actors sank their teeth into the roles with relish. Brendan Fraser was a believable hero/father figure and Eliza Bennett (Tora from Nanny McPhee) was convincing as his daughter, but neither role was particularly memorable.

In short, a decent enough movie, but I suspect I would enjoy the book more.",1283990400,2,1850,4.869841269841269

3721527,4,B001NPD9JA,"INKHEART comes along at a time when fantasy films are sorely needed. It is an intelligent person's escape caper, Part One of a novel trilogy by Cornelia Funke that dares to take an adult theme and make it equally appealing to all ages.  David Lindsay-Abaire's screenplay maintains all of the magic of the novel and offers director Iain Softley the opportunity to plug in a cast of famous British actors to tell a story about books!

Mo 'Silvertongue' Folchart (Brendan Fraser) has the ability to bring characters from books off the pages when he reads aloud. This transference from the book page to the real world creates all manner of fun and havoc when of course evil character Capricorn (Andy Serkis) wants to take advantage of Mo's 'gift' and use it to his own wily ways.  The fact that Mo's daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) has inherited her father's gift puts a different slant on the chaos that arises and it is the father/daughter relationship that overcomes the evils.  The people we meet along the way are bizarre characters, both real and book people, portrayed by such brilliant actors as Helen Mirren, Richard Strange, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, Jim Broadbent and a host of wildly made up actors with words printed on their bodies. This is a bit of fluff that lights up the screen because of the virtuosity of the story coupled with the production values of the crew and actors.  It is a fine little film that can be shared with the whole family - or simply enjoyed by avid readers who have always yearned to literally enter the story of  the novel they are reading!

3721530,3,B001NPD9JA,"Oh, Brendan Fraser. How does one actor make so many movies that almost work but don't? He's been in a few brilliant films, a few god-awful ones, but the majority of them fall into an ever-widening pool of narrow misses.

""Inkheart"" is another one of those. It's frustratingly close. You want to go up to the screen and nudge it a bit so it crosses the line. It's a fantasy-- a genre where logic is only slightly required. If this story had made a wee bit more sense, it would've hit the fantasy-acceptable mark. If the dialogue had more crackle and the characters had more contrast, it would've worked. It looks beautiful. The effects are good. There are clever moments. It's well cast with actors known to be entertaining and who are spot-on for their parts. It could've been a lovely, enjoyable family film if it had been given any amount of extra thought.

The movie tells the story of a man who finds out too late that when he reads aloud, it brings parts of the books he reads into the real world while it randomly sends real people into the book being read.  When he reads the little-known children's book ""Inkheart"" to his wife, menacing characters fall out and his wife disappears. To have any chance of getting her back, he must have a copy of the rare book, so he packs up his young daughter and they spend years going from old bookstore to old bookstore rummaging through stacks of neglected volumes but not finding the one book he needs.

Fraser's bookbinder Mo is a likable good guy, the sort of character that's become Fraser's mainstay. Mo is a loving dad who's frightened by his unwanted ability and whose only quest is to read his wife home. It's a sweet, solid performance as Fraser plays straight man to some class-A scene-stealers. They are:

Helen Mirren-- no explanation required. She doesn't work at upstaging anyone, it just happens. Here she's the wealthy aunt of Mo's missing wife. Despite her flamboyant style, she has hermitted herself away with the collection of books she treasures, preferring to read adventures, not live them.

Jim Broadbent-- no explanation required here, either. He has one of those faces. He has one of those voices. He plays ""Inkheart's"" author and it's entertaining to see how much glee he gets from meeting the characters he created, even the horrible ones.

Paul Bettany-- He can't not be noticed. He's an actor who has an edgy energy about him--sort of like a younger Peter O'Toole. Twice his supporting characters have diverted attention from Russell Crowe-- as the lively college roommate in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and as the ship's doctor and naturalist in ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World."" Except for looking at Heath Ledger, the only joy to be had in the mess that is ""A Knight's Tale"" is Bettany's Chaucer. He stole the movie, or at least as much of it as he wanted. In Inkheart, his juggler Dustfinger is referred to as scary, but he's more scoundrel than villain as he attempts to right the wrong that's been done to him.

Rafi Gavron-- As a teen thief who is thankfully of no consequence to the plot of ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,"" he's adorable and adds a welcome lightness to his scenes. He's the future of scene stealing, earning some preliminary chops here among the pros.

Needless to say, when these actors are on screen together in any combination, you don't know where to look. It's mind-bending to try to understand how anyone could make a marginal movie with this cast.

In addition to the above, Eliza Bennett plays daughter Meggie. It's not a role that requires a lot, but she does a good job of not overplaying what could have been a whiny part. Poor Andy Serkis is stuck playing the same ego-maniacally evil villain we've seen over and over. There's no imagination to his character or to his clich band of goons. They're not even a particularly scary lot, and the lack of anyone or anything truly frightening contributes largely to making the story tepid.

""Inkheart"" has a fun, unofficial running game, a sort of ""Name that Tune"" where you try to recognize classic children's literature based on a character or a telltale prop. Watch it with your kids, and if they can't tell you what comes from where, move away from the TV and read them a book.",1266796800,28,4245,4.6466666666666665

Its like offering someone a bowl of ice cream to eat and they say they'd rather have tofu because its nearly the same. Yes there were a few sections of the movie where the filming suddenly changes.

3721534,4,B001NPD9JA,"First of all, it should be stated that Inkheart is NOT a horror movie- it's a fantasy/adventure film.  The description can be misleading.

It's probably more of a childrens story, but it's a pretty good one nonetheless, and adults like myself shouldn't have a problem watching a film like this.

What makes the film so entertaining is that it's about a father who has this amazing ability to bring to life the fictional characters from any book he reads.  We find out later his daughter has the same talent.

The storyline focuses on the father and daughter going on a quest to find the wife/mother who supposedly got stuck inside a book.  You see, every time a fictional creature comes out of a book, a person from the real world has to go inside the book, in exchange.

You are later introduced to other amazing characters that have special talents, such as one man being able to light things on fire whenever he wants, and the book writer himself (who kind of looks like Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire, haha).

Most of the fantasy storytelling takes place inside a castle in the mountains, and throughout the movie strange events occur as a result of the father (played by Brendan Fraser) making those things happen.

That huge creature with orange eyes that makes an appearance at the very end is going to haunt my dreams!!  That darn thing is SCARY!!

Overall, the acting is really good overall, the adventurous aspect of the storyline is nailed pretty smoothly (but let's be honest here, this film is no Harry Potter) and everything is in fine order.  Worth watching with the kids.",1260576000,,1589,4.676258992805756
3721535,3,B001NPD9JA,"***1/2

In ""Inkheart,"" based on the best-selling novel by Cornelia Funke, Brendan Fraser plays what is known in literary circles as a ""silver-tongue"" - a person with the rare ability to make characters he is reading about come miraculously to life.  Literally.  Unfortunately, this is one talent Mo might well wish he didn`t possess, for the consequences both to himself and to his family have been disastrous to say the very least.  For one night, while reading a fantasy novel called ""Inkheart"" to his little girl, not only does Mo inadvertently unleash all the disreputable villains and creatures who reside within its pages onto an unsuspecting world, but his own wife becomes trapped inside the story (the rule, apparently, is that for every person who comes out of a book, another must go in to take his place).  Nine years later, Mo and his now twelve-year-old daughter, Meggie (Eliza Bennett), roam the world's antique bookshops looking for a copy of the work in the hopes that he will be able to read his wife back out of it.  The trouble really begins when the characters Mo unleashed earlier finally catch up with him and Meggie, kidnap them - along with Meggie's mouthy Aunt Elinor (Helen Mirren) - then cart them off to an isolated castle so Mo can read more characters out of the book for them.

As written by David Lindsay-Abaire and directed by Iain Softley, ""Inkheart"" isn't as captivating as the recent and somewhat similar ""The Fall,"" but the movie has enough energy and imagination to allow even the most cynical among us to suspend our disbelief for the duration and join in the fun.  In its attempts to blend realism with fantasy, the screenplay doesn't always make perfect sense, but most audience members will be willing to overlook an inconsistency or two for the sake of the experience.

And quite an experience it turns out to be, with glorious vistas and exotic images effectively complementing the oddball characters and fairy tale settings.  The large and genial cast does a fine job with their roles, with veteran character actors such as Mirren, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent (as the author of the original fiction) lending more than a touch of class to the proceedings.

And although the last third of the movie slithers to pieces in a welter of action movie clichs and Middle Earth cheesiness, the first two-thirds, at least, provide decent fun for both the young and the not-so-young who accompany them in their viewing.",1259452800,2,2456,4.837708830548926
3721536,4,B001NPD9JA,"Sometimes, the timing of a movie's release is more important to its success than the movie's content itself.  This may help explain the success, or lack there-of, of this movie.  Released in early 2009, it quickly fell of the big theater chains and ended up in the cheap matinees.  It received zero Academy Award nominations, and barely registered a blip when released on DVD.  How so?  The movie has an innovative plot, features a large cast of good actors and actresses, has both male and female leads and supporting roles, has good special effects, and is appropriate for almost all age groups.  The reason why this movie bombed is timing.  If this movie came out ten years ago, it would have been a blockbuster.  But in the past decade we have the LOTR trilogy, the Harry Potter franchise, two Narnia movies, and a whole host of other fantasy movies, all of whom have bigger casts, better cinematography, more exotic locales and grander action scenes than Inkheart.  So for 2009, a movie like Inkheart is old hat for most of the US movie-going audience.  This is unfortunate as this is Brendan Fraser's best movie.  It is neither ridiculous like Monkeybone, Dudley Do Right or his other comedies.  And it is not a mindless action flick like the Mummy movies.  No, this movie has a great story, and his role is probably the most realistic of all his movies.  Helen Mirren also plays a good supporting actress role.

3721563,4,B001NPD9JA,"Somewhere between ""Labyrinth"" and ""The NeverEnding Story"" lies INKHEART, the enchanting story of what happens when fact and fiction clash in a blazing battle of good and evil, based on the bestselling book by Cornelia Funke.

Mo Folchart (Brendan Fraser) is a ""silvertongue"", one of the rare people who can actually bring characters from books into the real world.  But it's a gift that can also lead to tragedy, especially when his beloved wife Resa (Sienna Guillory) disappears into the pages of ""Inkheart"", taking the place of one of it's main characters, fire juggler Dustfinger (Paul Bettany).  When Dustfinger finally tracks down Mo and his young daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) after several years have past, begging to read him back into the book, ""Inkheart""'s feared villains come forth and kidnap Meggie, who has unknowingly inherited her father's talents...

INKHEART is a complete romp from start to finish.  Genuinely moving in some areas and full of rollicking fairytale adventure in others.  Readers of classic fantasy will adore such plot-points as Meggie reading ""The Wizard of Oz's"" Toto into her world; and the delicious Helen Mirren in a wry, good-humoured performance as Aunt Elinor.

Brendan Fraser sadly underwhelms in the lead role, but everything else about INKHEART is absolute perfection.  Recommended.",1253750400,,1334,5.319047619047619
3721564,2,B001NPD9JA,"I hadn't read very good notices for this, but I've got a weakness for ""high fantasy"", OK? Stuff with dungeons and dragons and tunnels and trolls, I dig it. Even the bad ones, I can often have a good time with. Unfortunately there have been an awful lot of bad ones lately - STARDUST and PRINCE CASPIAN threatened me to put me off the genre for a good long while. But never say never...

The first problem with this German/British coproduction is that they make the mistake (from an artistic standpoint) of casting Brendan Fraser as the lead (I guess thinking about the box-office standpoint), an antiquarian book repair specialist (!!!). Why Mr. Fraser gets these roles on a regular basis is beyond me; he seems to be somebody's idea - or some several bodies' idea - of a replacement for Harrison Ford, Douglas Fairbanks, etc: the swashbuckling hero of period adventures and medieval fantasies. Except he is just about the most resolutely 21st-century presence around - everything about the guy in every film I've seen him in screams frat-boy football star at some Midwestern state school (and yes, I know he's Canadian-born) grown up now and maybe working as a car salesman. Buying him as a specialist in old books, or an archaeologist, or any character from pre-WWII automatically requires a larger suspension of disbelief than I care to make.

In this case, thankfully, he's not called upon to exist in a pre-Fraser world, and in fact he is one of the less-annoying and ill-conceived aspects of this film, despite being the only character in the film (entirely set in Europe) with an American accent for no reason that is ever explained. Essentially, Fraser is Mo Folchart, a ""silvertongue"" - a person born with the magical talent of making books come alive when he reads aloud from them, and he's on the run in the early part of the film from some unpleasant folks who appeared out of a book that he read aloud years before and who now want him to come to their remote castle and pull riches and power for them out of his magical book-reading. He has a teenage daughter, Meg (Eliza Bennett), and a wife who disappeared when he last read aloud a decade previous; y'see, when you bring something into this world from a book, part of our world trades places with it.

So a series of adventures ensues with Fraser at first trying to protect his kid and not use his powers and later joining forces with one of the less-evil characters he's brought over, Dustfinger (Paul Bettany in the only interesting performance in the film). At the end we have a big ol' special effects showdown and all the good guys are safe and the bad guys vanquished - hey this is a kid's fantasy, I'm not spoiling anything.

Flat both dialog- and action-wise, directed by Iaian Softely without panache, betraying it's relatively low budget (less than $50 million) and full of all kinds of quite vast logical errors - Folchart has to locate a copy of the very rare book that exchanged his wife for all the baddies, astonishingly named ""Inkheart"", but has never once in a decade thought to try to find the author? - this is nevertheless reasonably tolerable, as the actors are all professional if not interesting (even Helen Mirren has little to do) and the locations and sets are nice enough to look at. And I liked the concept though it doesn't strike me as terribly original. By all accounts the book is better - I'll probably check that out at some point.",1253577600,,3432,4.649093904448105

On the plus side, it has an amazing cast (Brendan Fraser, Helen Mirren and Jim Broadbent come to mind) and it does have it's humorous moments.
If you read the book and loved it, Id say don't see it. If you read the story and hated it, maybe you'll see something better in this movie. If you haven't read the book, go for it.

A castle hidden deep within is the setting of a glorious fairy tale in the vein of Oliver Twist, The Secret Garden and  A Little Princess, only with 21st century film action and quality. There is also the current trend towards touchy feely, going into the minds of characters to discover the weaknesses and streangths that drive them foward -- little dream sequences and murky flashbacks. This tendency, however, does not become intrusive. The story itself is simple: A family that will do anything to be together, an evil villian and his thugs trying to tear their world apart. But the crafting of the story is a work of art, a visual feast from the first minute to the last. Breathtaking ligtning and fire -- a fire juggler with long, tousled hair and garbed in a deliciously gothic ""great coat"" -- a unicorn, a monitour, flying monkeys, thugs in black who march to chilling monastic vocals . . . I could go on and on. Ignore the sour one star reviews and sit down with a mug of hot chocolate to a visual and emotional experience you haven't had in years.

I figured since my kids nor I had not read the book, we would be lost in the story.  So not true.  The story grabbed us at the beginning and we were never at a loss as to what was happening.  Sure, knowing the story more thoroughly from the book might have been nicer, but reading the book is definitely  not a necessity.  The scenery, action and storyline were all interesting and the pace was quick.  Maybe a few short draggy moments during the movie when something is being explained, but otherwise it kept me and my kids at attention.  During the summer we watched duds like Bedtime Stories and Mall Cop,and I would rather watch Inkheart again then watch either of those.  My rating is more like a 4.5, and I almost feel like giving it a 5 the more I think about the movie.
  If you don't want to watch stupid humor movies with your kids, i.e. Bedtime Stories, then something like this that is full of adventure, lessons in life and fantasy would be a perfect ticket.  Plus, it is really PG,no cussing or kissing.  The Shadow monster shows up briefly and is kind of scary though, but nothing my 9 year old couldn't handle.",1251676800,,1274,4.370212765957447

3721605,1,B001NPD9JA,"In the world of fantasy films, there's original, refreshingly unoriginal, and unoriginal. Inkheart falls headfirst, painfully I might add, into the latter. You see, the movie gets lost in translation between great concept, and messy execution. Maybe it's because most of the characters are whiny, or not likable, not to mention one-dimensional, but the acting is atrocious also. Brandon Frazer is truly sleepwalking, Paul Bettany should know better than to do this, and what the heck is Helen Mirren doing here? Did she wander onto the wrong set, and the writer's were so overjoyed, they wrote some lines for her, in which she doesn't contribute to the movie what so ever? That sound's about right.

This randomness continues into the plot, taking good opportunities and not playing on them, or ignoring them. The daughter in the movie is left alone while the father goes off to save the day, bad guys kidnap girl, father is surprised when this happens, she ends up saving the day. Oh, the chiche! Not even chiche with fun, but chiche is lots of tediousness, which amounts to an hour and 45 minutes that feels twice as long.

Overall, the only redeeming feature is that your easy to please 10-year old might like it if you rent it, but you will want to stay away, and never, under any circumstances, buy this wasted piece of chiched and tedious, not to mention painful, crap. And they want to make a sequel to this? Oh, kill me now!",1249257600,12,1432,4.724

3721627,3,B001NPD9JA,"This movie was kind of a disappointment really. The characters were weak and sort of dumb. It lacked the depth that the book has. One of my biggest annoyances is that Basta is supposed to be scary, but he's sort of a dork. That was one of the things about the book. The characters were incredibly and even unnecessarily evil and the movie just didn't pull that off. Also, by changing the story around Resa they turned Dustfinger into a selfish coward. Granted, he was selfish, but he wasn't that bad. Also, the reading was too controlled. It should have been unpredictable. Well, I could go on for a while, but I won't bore you. There were just so many things that turned the story from good to mediocre.

  In it's defense, the story wasn't terrible, just not what I was expecting. The acting was good as well as the special effects and I do think they did a pretty good job with Capricorn's character. If I had seen it without reading the book I might have liked it, but I can't be sure because I did read the book and I know what it should have been like.

3721629,3,B001NPD9JA,"I always have high expectations about book-to-movie adaptations, which is probably why I gave this movie a low rating. The movie and the effects were great, but the details and events were changed sometimes greatly.

For example, Meggie shouldn't have an accent if Mo doesn't. Others things such as 'Silvertongues' don't exist; Mo is called that by Dustfinger, Basta, and Capricorn. Mo wouldn't lose his copy of Inkheart as well. But really, those aren't detrimental to the plot line. The ending was different and I was a little upset because the original ending was way better.

But in regard to the movie itself, the effects were excellent. The actors and actresses portrayed the characters just I had imagined. Brendan Fraser was perfect as Mo Folchart -- he's the father figure that you would want to look up to.

While the movie is not as intriguing as the book--it is still a good entertaining family movie and definitely worth watching. It's fast pace and basically follows the general story line of the book.  I found it interesting to see how they adapted it.

For those of you who haven't read the book--you won't know what you missing and I think you will be much less critical than those of us who read and loved the book.",1247702400,,567,4.231481481481482
3721631,2,B001NPD9JA,"The premise of ""Inkheart"" is intriguing:  certain persons have a special gift -- when they read aloud, they bring characters of fiction into the real world.  The downside:  for every fictional character who comes into the real world, a real human being is taken into the fictional world.

 Mo Folchart (Brendan Fraser), a book buyer and restorer, has this ability, and is stalked by a mysterious figure as he and daughter Meggie (Eliza Hope Bennett) browse through an open-air book market.  The stranger is Dustfinger (Paul Bettany), a fictional character Mo brought into the real world years earlier who longs to return to his family in the pages of ""Inkheart,"" a now rare, out-of-print book.  When Dustfinger appeared in our world, Mo's wife, Resa (Sienna Guillory), disappeared into the book's world.

 The plot is essentially a quest in which assorted characters combine forces, meet others along the way, and dedicate themselves to a mutually beneficial goal.  Of course, as with all quests, this won't be easy.  There's a group of fictional folks, under the leadership of Capricorn (Andy Serkis), who've made a very nice life for themselves in the real world, taken up residence in a hillside castle, and have no intention of returning to their fictional world.

Brendan Fraser seems to be the go-to guy for movie fantasies  (think ""The Mummy"" franchise and last summer's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"").  He has always seemed to me a grown-up with boy-like wonderment.  What he lacks in acting chops, he makes up for in earnestness, knowing that at any second this fantasy can degenerate into camp.

This does actually happen with the character of Elinor Lordan (Helen Mirren), Mo's aunt, an eccentric, turban-wearing book collector who speaks her mind with little regard for others' feelings.  Initially, the character is used to move the plot along.  She disappears for a long time and reappears in the movie's final third, speeding up the mountainside on a motorbike and later riding a unicorn into a sanitized battle pitting the forces of good against evil.  It's difficult to accept the sophisticated Ms. Mirren as this exaggerated caricature.

Bettany, who is best remembered as the imaginary friend of John Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind,"" conveys appropriate menace in the film's early scenes, but also a wistfulness -- even a sadness -- because of his entrapment in a world that's not his own.

Bennett plays Meggie not as a starry-eyed innocent but as a mature, intelligent young woman.  Her Meggie is not just along for the ride.  She  participates in decision making, is in the midst of the action rather than on the sidelines, and exhibits many qualities of the movie heroine.  She helps shore up the proceedings with her down-to-earth, focused performance.

 Even with the fantasy element, the movie limps along, predictable all the way.  We've seen cinema fantasies that are far more effective.  ""The Wizard of Oz"" still enchants viewers after all these years (there's an interesting homage to that classic in ""Inkheart,"" incidentally).  ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was the movie without equal for a whole generation.  More recently, the ""Harry Potter"" movies have shown how a solid script, engaging characters, and state-of-the-art special effects can combine to produce genuinely thrilling fantasy adventures.

 Rated PG, ""Inkheart"" builds to an anticipated climax, but loses dramatic steam before the final credits roll.",1247356800,4,3458,5.1288014311270125
3721632,5,B001NPD9JA,"I find it odd that this movie garnered such medicore praise. It was far more original and entertaining than many other fantasy film attempts out there, the bland/boring Eregon and the sad maiming of The Dark Is Rising novel for film come instantly to mind. I found Inkheart on the same level as the better films in the genre, good companions for the filmed versions of Narnia, Harry Potter, and Funke's other excellent novel-to-screen adaptation, The Thief Lord. Inkheart balances drama with comedy in much the same vein as classics like Time Bandits and The Princess Bride, and its nice to see Urban Fantasy onscreen as we did in Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2. Some critics complained about the literary aspects of the story being overbearing, but I see this as an attempt to pander to faux-hip technology by those not wanting to seem so un-trendy as to have ever loved books. Some of these same critics went on about kids reading books with Harry Potter novels being no big deal as well. Maybe they think people are better served texting or twittering mindless drivel all day long on their Blackberries. Whatever. Ignore the critics and read. And see Inkheart.",1246838400,4,1162,4.815
3721633,3,B001NPD9JA,"Based on a very long novel by Cornelia Funke, I found the book wasn't all that great. This is due to the author geared the novel to a very young audience. So how does one cram an almost 600 page novel into a movie under 2 hours. You can't.

The movie starts out well with a nice blend of mystery/fantasy and rapidly goes downhill. The film makers have tried to give the audience far too much information in a small space of time and the movie loses it's momentum very quickly.

The great cast is stuck with an overstuffed script. Even the ever reliable hero, Brendan Frasier seems at a loss. I did enjoy this movie on one level--the wonderful Helen Mirren. She is worth watching any time and manages the impossible. She actually rises above the material. The equally good Andy Serkis who made such a great little villain in THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy seems at a loss as Capricorn who is the villain of the piece. He comes across as a wet noodle at times due to the bogged down script.

I watched this twice in an effort to make some sense out of this far-fetched flick. I only read about a half dozen chapters of the book before getting bored. However, the book made sense, the movie does not.

Funke who is the 3rd largest selling children authors, is at times a poor man's Harry Potter ""wannabe"". But her books are well written and gives the reader the sense of love and respect for the written word that was so vital in her Inkheart trilogy. Somehow it got lost here.

Watch STARDUST if you want something original and exciting. It never received the attention it warranted, particularly when you have another tremendous cast.

Watch ""Inkheart"" closely, or you will get lost in no time.",1246838400,2,1692,4.459546925566343

3721657,2,B001NPD9JA,"I should have liked this movie. I'm a sci-fi and fantasy fan and can often enjoy even middle of the road quality movies in the genre. However, Inkheart was a huge let down for me and was actually painful to watch.

The special effects were top notch and Brendan Frasier has some cache in the big screen fantasy genre, however, aside from these two elements it would be impossible to believe that this film saw theatrical release.

The script, dialog, costumes, most of the acting, editing, physical sets, music and most of all directing had the distinctive feel of one of the poorer quality Sci-Fi channel Original movies. Made for TV all the way and a poor example of a made for TV fantasy pic to boot. The movie is a mess from beginning to end and it's the first movie in years where I've been so glad when it finally came to an end.

With so much wrong with the movie, it really comes back to the director. The dialog and action were horribly directed and the framing of almost every shot was off in one way or the other. I began to imagine as the movie went along how a shot should have been framed, at what angles the action should have been filmed and how the shots should have transitioned. No, I'm not a film student or aspiring or arm chair director with jaded expectations, just a lover of movies who can discern competent direction from the amateur.

The bare bones of an existing movie were there somewhere, but if any movie needed some major re-writes by some script doctor wunderkind, this was it.

And a final mention for the horrible musical score. Uninspired at best, but at worst, on multiple occasions, the music was so inappropriate for what was happening on screen that I had to wonder if a non-musically inclined editor just slapped pieces of this and that randomly onto the soundtrack after their music budget came up short.

Yes, this movie really is that bad. 1 1/2 stars, because I'm sure there are even worse movies out there some where.",1246579200,,1964,4.502808988764045

The story was never really fleshed out and the characters weren't given time to develop.  Great premise but badly handled, presumably by the editors.

3721663,5,B001NPD9JA,"Let me begin this by saying that I am biased.  When I read Inkheart the first time, something about it enchanted me more than any other book I've ever read.  The characters loved books as I did, believed in the characters as I did.  The chapters each started with little quotes from books I knew and loved.  And the rest of the series drew me in even more with the love it expressed for reading and writing.  Fenoglio's opinions of writing and his struggles with finding the right words really resonated with me (although I often feel more like an Orpheus... though maybe less of a sell-out.)

Yes, there were differences from book to movie.  But I felt those differences were appropriate for the book-to-movie change.  In my opinion, if a story isn't making the best of the medium it's in, it's not going to be its best, and a number of the scenes in the book read a lot better than they would look.  Plus there were some great foreshadowing moments in the movie that were not in the book, as the book was written before the author knew she was going to write its sequels.  Other changes really empowered young Meggie in a way that I liked.

Despite the changes, the characters are true to themselves, and the story's message is so much the same from book to movie.  I love this movie, and this story, and it's very likely that I'm going to watch it for a very long time.

I would have liked more understanding as to the ""Whys"" and ""Hows"" of things, and I believe that the movie could have been longer with more depth. Do not try to tell me that the Fantasy Movies for kids need to be 90 minutes. Look at the Harry Potter series, all hitting about 2 hours a pop.

And the bonus feature of the actress reading a chapter not even in the movie? that was a waste of space in my opinion.",1245888000,3,657,4.10077519379845
3721687,2,B001NPD9JA,"The concept was interesting, especially the idea of flawed readings, but the story became lame really fast, the chief symptom being the villain's lame name. Actually, many names were lame - Capricorn, Dustfinger, etc. Bad harbinger of things to come.

The movie itself was surprisingly tedious and unexciting. The climactic battle was no exception, and the scene of Elinor riding out on a unicorn was far from awe-inspiring; it looked silly. And a plot point there didn't make sense - Meggie starts reading something that's not in the book, then forgets that she could do that and has to actually write on her arm.

I appreciate the author's intent of making books attractive and interesting, but if this is the kind of movie that comes from books, it's a lost cause.",1245801600,,767,4.847328244274809
3721688,5,B001NPD9JA,"Outrageous things happen in a real way. Real things like book fantasy become surreal. Moody, atmospheric and literate. This is a film without an audience. Too serious for kids and too childish for adults... with exceptions. I like it. Film is cooler than its reputaton. Will rule in future. It was different.
I liked 'Return to OZ' which met with a lot of opposition. What you've got to ask yourself is, am I the exception? Well....are ya, punk!

3721689,3,B001NPD9JA,"Mortimer ""Mo"" Folchart (Brendan Fraser) makes his living as a repairer of old books.  He and his daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) travel all over Europe stopping in antiquated bookshops.  And in each one, Mo searches the entire collection for one book in particular, Inkheart.

Mo finally finds a copy, but just after he does, he is confronted by Dustfinger (Paul Bettany), one of the characters from the novel.  Mo manages to run away, and he and Meggie flee to great aunt Elinor's (Helen Mirren) in Italy.  But they aren't safe there.  Dustfinger appears again, says he is working with Capricorn (Andy Serkis) now, and kidnaps the three of them.

Only when the group reaches Capricorn's castle does Mo explain what is happening.  Seems he is a Silvertongue and has the ability to read characters into and out of books.  Dustfinger and Capricorn are characters in Inkheart, but Mo wants to find a copy for a very personal reason.  What do the characters want?  Can Mo and his family escape?

The previews for this movie made it seem like I would love it.  Heck, as a reader, the premise of characters traveling between a novel and the real world appeals to me.  But the movie just seemed off to me.

And it's mainly a matter of expectations.  I expected lots of references to characters from famous novels.  There are some, but the main focus is on the characters from the book in question.  I expected a fast paced action story.  Yes, there were action scenes, but there were also long passages between them where the story moved forward rather slowly.

I did find myself getting lost in the story.  The acting was top notch, and the special effects were jaw dropping.  Heck, even the cinematography held impressive shots of lakes and castles.

A word of warning to parents.  There are some frightening creatures and intense action sequences, including the climax.  You might want to preview it before your let your young kids watch it, especially those who frighten easily.

I half expected to rush out and read the books after I caught this in the theater, and that still hasn't happened.  If you watch the film, you'll enjoy it, but there's not reason to rush out to do so.",1245715200,7,2177,4.690476190476191
3721690,1,B001NPD9JA,"These books are amongst my favorites so when I watched the trailer for this movie, I was disappointed: I don't like Brendan Fraser, Helen Mirren, and Paul Bettany as actors. But I decided to give them a chance. Could they make justice to the characters created by Cornelia Funke that I learned to love? Sadly the answer is NO.

The story is set in Germany, but everyone strangely has an English accent, except Fraser who can't seem to make even a fake one. Is hiring German actors who speak proper English such a hard thing to do? It would've made the movie respect the original material a bit more.

Now with the characters:
- Mortimer: In the book he has an endearing quality to him. Just an average nice guy with a lot of hidden pain inside. He has a mysterious quality that makes you wanna learn more about his story. A good role for an actor but Fraser's performance is flat and one dimensional. It doesn't provoke anything.

-Meggie: In the book she is very pretty since she resembles her mother, Resa who was a beauty. Sadly enough Eliza Bennett is not gracious at all and her performance is rather forgettable.

-Dustfinger: In the book he was a not very tall guy, not too strong but quite athletic and agile. He had long red hair and had a way with the ladies. He wasn't handsome in a conventional way, but had plenty of charm. Instead they chose Paul Bettany to play him, a lanky guy that looks like an albino lizard on crack. What on earth were they thinking?!

-Capricorn: In the book he is very creepy, skinny and has a cold stare that makes your shiver. A man of little words whose actions are unpredictable and of course horrid most of the time. In the movie, Andy Serkis, bless his heart, is just a bald guy trying to look mean.

-Mortola: In the book she is in charge of the maids. She dresses very simply, she is almost like a prude. She is corpulent and bitter, authoritarian and with a big secret in her heart. In the movie they make her look like homeless witch with stupid hair and dress. Lesley Sharp didn't capture this character at all!

-Capricorn's gang: Not scary at all. They look like they come from a kid's play. Basta is even comical!

-Elinor: I was SO DISAPPOINTED with Helen Mirren's interpretation of Elinor! In the book she was this chubby lady with glasses that almost dressed and looked like a librarian. She was grouchy but funny, with the best of hearts. All in all, one of the most endearing characters in the book. Mirren portrays her as an pompous English snob who dresses like a fortune teller. She tries to be funny but fails miserably. No wonder she won an Oscar for playing Elizabeth II. You don't even feel sorry for her when her books get burned!

My dream cast for this film would've been the following:
Mortimer: Edward Norton
Meggie: Dakota Fanning
Dustfinger: Eric Stoltz
Capricorn: Chistopher Walken
Mortola: Anjelica Huston
Elinor: Imelda Staunton.

But one can only dream right? What I liked about the books is the fact that they were pretty dark, sort of fantasy for adults if you will. This movie is for kids. I wonder what Cornelia Funke has to say about this...PLEASE read the books before watching this. This movie only angered me.",1244246400,14,3193,4.527777777777778
3721691,2,B001NPD9JA,"I was surprised to see so many positive reviews for this movie.  From a description of the plot line, it would seem like this movie would be full of fantastic creatures and an adventurous story.  Instead, the story is painfully one dimensional and loaded with inconsistencies and fallacies.  I will not give a plot summary here as others have done that better than I could.

Thumbs Up
* Makeup and costumes were excellent.
* I read another review that criticized the special effects, but I thought they were great.
* The stylization is consistent and creates an interesting mood.

Thumbs Down
* A story loaded with holes and inconsistencies
* I wasn't attached to the characters.  I thought the little girl was irritating and Brendan Frazer's actions were so erratic and nonsensical that he never truly caught my interest.  Their story never really drew me in as an audience member.

Inconsistencies
* Brendan Frazer's character claimed he never read the girl any stories, yet she knows quite a few characters from literature.
* Why does the girl have a British accent?  She's been raised by an American father.
* In the middle of the movie, the characters decide to go to the author's house to see if he has an additional copy.... really?... they didn't think of this in the 9 years they've been searching??
* Brendan Frazer's distrust of dustfingers in the beginning of the movie doesn't make any sense.  There is no disincentive to teaming up.
* The characters realize that whatever the people with the ""gift"" read comes to life so they decide to read things that they want to happen.  I have a hard time believing they wouldn't have come to that conclusion a little earlier.
* Lighting the castle on fire in the end was completely unnecessary
* They make it a point to drive to the Great Aunt's house.  In fact, the Brendan Frazer character said ""we NEED to get there"".  Yet there was absolutely no purpose in them going there.  Great Aunt was really no help and there was absolutely no need to go there.

I don't believe this movie will necessarily motivate/not-motivate children to read.  Even if the net effect of this movie were positive, there are other ""pro reading"" movies that do the same thing significantly better.",1243036800,32,2228,4.733160621761658
3721692,4,B001NPD9JA,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. When Mo (Brendan Fraser) reads out loud, literature quite literally comes to life.
2. He learns the hard way that when something comes out, something must go in.
3. He accidentally ""exchanges"" someone close to him while inadvertently bringing out three characters from the book ""Inkheart""
4. Two of them make themselves at home, while one will stop at nothing to go back.
5. Tracking down copies of the now out of print book becomes a necessary obsession.
6. Fabulous fantasy frolic follows
7. Author takes artistic license to new levels
8. Story to be continued ....

Brendan Fraser, Paul Bettany, Jim Broadbent, Andy Serkis and Helen Mirren team up with some outstanding performances in this funny and imaginative movie version of Cornelia Funke's book of the same name.

This is one of those adaptations that works just fine on its own, so even if you haven't read the book, or the other two books that follow it, you won't have a problem following along.

Recommended for anybody who doesn't mind indulging in a little fantasy.

3721693,2,B001NPD9JA,"Characters were almost uniformly selfish and rather stupid (especially the villains), action scenes were few and far between and when they occured were terribly contrived and unrealistic, very little was actually done with the classic stories incorporated into the plotline (frankly, sometimes incorporated like square pegs into round holes), the plot was only unpredictable in that it implied more was going to happen than ever did, and even the actors seemed underwhelmed by the activity around them.  The whole thing really took too long.  On the other hand, beatifully set and shot, with outstanding cinematagraphy.  My daughter was bored (and she's a diehard Brendan Fraser fan!), my son never paid attention at all, and all my wife and I could think was ""When is this going to be done so we can get some errands done?""",1236470400,2,824,5.044117647058823
3721694,3,B001NPD9JA,"...but isn't is always. I, and a friend, went to see Inkheart when it first came out. She left the theater yelling that it was the worst movie she had ever seen. She was very disappointed that they chose to add things that were not in the book and did not include things that were. We both really enjoyed the series of books. This was her first experience with seeing a book she really enjoyed turned into a movie.

I did not think it was the worst movie ever, but I too was disappointed with the parts they added. I understand when the powers that be choose to take things out for a movie that are in a book; movies are only so long. But if time is a factor why add things that are not in the book?

The storm at the beginning of the book when Dustfinger first makes an appearance is so much more dramatic and sets a much better scene than him finding them in a street book fair. Where is Meggie's box of books that Mo bound for her? Why would Mo loose his copy of Inkheart? He clearly had a copy that he read from to bring Dustfinger, Basta, and Capricorn out of the book and Theresa into it. Do you really think he would loose it or distroy it when it might be the only way to bring his wife back? He clearly loves and knows how to take care of books being a bookbinder. That is just a few of the problems with the movie as it relates to the book.

The movie was not that bad when looked at away from the book, but the book was so good it was dissappointing to see the way the story was changed.",1235433600,5,1498,4.003344481605351
3721695,3,B001NPD9JA,"Mo Folchart (Fraser) and his daughter Meggie (Folchert) travel the world in search of the hard to find book ""Inkheart"".  He is a silvertongue, and when Meggie was younger, Mo read from the book and brought the story to life.  But, when something comes out of the story, something, or someone, must take its place.  In this case, it was his wife, Resa (guillory).  They are chased by two characters from the book, the evil Capricorn (Serkis), who wants to rule the real world, and Dustfinger (Bettany), who just wants to go home.  With the help of Mo's Great Aunt Elinor (Mirren), they set out to find the author of the book (Broadbent) to set things right.

""Inkheart"" could have been much better.  The solid cast is there, and they all do credible jobs in their roles.  The effects are there - they are as good as any special effects laden film of late.  The problem lies in the story.  Not that it is bad; one just gets the feeling that something was lost in the translation from book to film.  I have been told that things have been changed, and I cannot help but think that they were for the worse.  The ending itself suffers from what ""Hellboy II"" suffered from: a sense that things could have been resolved much earlier and easier given what resolves things.  (Of course ""Hellboy II"" was a better film and able to overcome this problem.)  If more movies are made in this series, the moviemakers need to tighten the story a little more and stay truer to the author's original vision.",1234051200,2,1488,4.503731343283582
3721696,5,B001NPD9JA,"Ever wish Narnia or Middle Earth were real? Or that you really could sit down to coffee with Jo March or Anne of Green Gables? What if anything you read came out of the book and into your world?

People with this gift exist in Inkheart. They're called Silvertongues, and some of them don't even know they have this ability, like Mo Folchart (Brendan Fraser). One night when he reads from a novel called Inkheart to his wife and three-year-old daughter, more than one villainous character suddenly appears out of the book, and his wife suddenly disappears into the book.

Mo has never read aloud again, and for nine years he's searched tirelessly for another rare copy of Inkheart in the hopes that somehow he can read his wife back out. His daughter Meggie (Eliza Bennett) is now twelve and travels Europe with her father, a bookbinder, from bookstore to bookstore. She doesn't know why her Mom abandoned them. She doesn't even know what her father's searching for. But she soon finds out when a strange man named Dustfinger confronts Mo, demanding to be read back into Inkheart. The adventure soon takes both of them into the wilds of Italy, and along the way they make friends and enemies, discovering more than they wish about themselves and the magic of Inkheart.

Based on a novel by Cornelia Funke, Inkheart is a wonderful tribute to the power of story and the love of reading. It's hard to see why its been lambasted by many critics, because all the elements of a great family-friendly film are here in full force. Its reverence for books shows kids that reading is magical and books are to be treasured. The fantasy adventure taps into a thriving market that's already been developed by Harry Potter and Narnia.

Inkheart features several noteworthy actors and actresses. Brendan Fraser is of course the quintessential action/adventure dude from the Mummy movies and Walden Media's Journey to the Center of the Earth. Helen Mirren as cranky and sarcastic Great-Aunt Elinor is brilliant (The movie's worth watching for her scenes alone.) Villain Capricorn is played by none other than the guy who brought us Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Jim Broadbent (The Professor in The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe) as Fenoglio, the author of the novel Inkheart in the movie, is thoroughly convincing as a curmudgeon writer in awe that his characters have come to life before him. Hardly the cast of a flop.

Why aren't we hearing more about this movie? Sure, there are a few minor continuity guffaws that'll have you scratching your head, like one minute it's day in a scene, the next minute the sun is setting. But this is a forgivable offense and found in many box office hits.

Maybe Inkheart veers too far from the novel upon which its based. It's been said big changes were made. Could this really account for the lack of ticket sales? We might never know. But even if you've never read the book, there's much to enjoy in the movie. With a strong theme of familial love and enough humor to crack up the room, it's amazing Inkheart is being lost in the shuffle. Let's hope it's the sleeper that becomes a DVD hit.

8327613,5,B001NPD9JA,"A number of others here have called Inkheart derivative because it contains some elements from The Wizard of Oz. Of course it does  thats the whole point! Its amazing to me that some people can watch a movie, and not see it.

The premise of this wonderful fantasy is that certain gifted people can literally bring fiction to life by reading books aloud.  As a result, the story is peppered with characters and artifacts from childrens classics: the flying monkeys, a tornado, and a terrier named Toto from The Wizard of Oz, along with Peter Pans ticking crocodile, one of Ali Babas Forty Thieves, Ebenezer Scrooges headstone, Cinderellas glass slipper, and King Arthurs sword in the stone among others.

It seems impossible to miss this central idea  the daughter reads from a book clearly marked Oz, and those things appear.  When the ticking crocodile is discovered, we realize someone has been reading from Peter Pan.  Its not hard to connect those dots.  They are very large dots, and only about an inch apart.

Inkhearts great cast includes Brendan Fraser, Helen Mirren, Andy Serkis, Jim Broadbent and Jennifer Connolly.  Directed by Iain Softley, who also directed Backbeat and K-Pax.",1526774400,,1190,4.9646464646464645
