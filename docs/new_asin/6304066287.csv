7861607,3,6304066287,"I first caught this movie on television back in the early-to-mid-eighties and was a bit miffed to find that it was never replayed (on Australian TV anyway).
It became part of a bucket list of rare movies, viewed a long time ago, many with a sporting emphasis; that I have sought to re-acquire. I had forgotten just how generic and typical of its genre is this work.
In the seventies there were a rash of box-office films and telemovies made, all of  which emphasised the hard-drinking, shiftless, drifting rodeo cowboy, unable to commit or settle down, who ""hooks up"" with a young college-educated girl out slumming or trying to ""discover herself"".
Girl pressures boy for a deeper commitment, boy can't cope with pressure or emotional commitment; there's an almighty row and they split.
Boy often enters one too many rodeos and gets busted up so badly that his rodeo career is finished, or he's killed.
With some variation of detail, this work is comparable with the likes of ""Junior Bonner"", ""When the Legends Die"", ""J.W. Coop"" and others.
The punchline? Who knows? I find it a bit like the exploitative quasi-commentaries which ""deplore"" crime, sex, the like -- yet manage somehow to titillate the audience with liberal and gratuitous lashings of same.
Anyone who had seen a few movies in this genre knew it was going to end badly.
The woman in this movie is crass, loud, boring and a pain in the neck. The male? Probably typical of an era before rodeo competitors became the focussed and disciplined athletes that the majority of them are today.
I pursue works like this for the sporting theme. I have to say that the rodeo stunts aren't bad.
For artistic merit  ---- give it a miss.",1396742400,,1686,4.7312925170068025
