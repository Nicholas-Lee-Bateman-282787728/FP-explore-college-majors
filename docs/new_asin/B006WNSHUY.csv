5024359,5,B006WNSHUY,"As a Carmen Sandiego fan, this is a must have. All episodes, 4 dics, decent quality image and sound, no subtitles at all (should have at least English and Spanish), however the decision to use a DVD case and 4 sleeves (1 per disc) is just horrible. They could have made a better edition overall (the 3 DVD set released in 2006 w/ the 1st season and a bunch of extras is awesome) for such a beloved show. It includes a bonus feature film (""The Secret Garden"") and a bonus episode of ""Liberty's Kids"" and both feel pretty random to be in this set.",1351296000,,545,4.25
5024360,5,B006WNSHUY,"Great purchase for all the education this series contains. I often find myself ""listening in"" while the DVD is playing for the kids. I am really pleased with this purchase and my kids request watching this instead of some shows that are not educational! I can't beat that:)",1348963200,2,273,4.708333333333333
5024361,5,B006WNSHUY,"I have play Carmen Sandiago before, and love the game, traveling in all the different locations, and all over the world, it is a great learning experience.

Keep up the good work!!!!!",1348012800,,183,4.71875
5024362,5,B006WNSHUY,"If you happen to be a child of the 1990's, you probably watched ""Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?"" on Fox Saturday Mornings or Fox/ABC Family.

A fun fact is this show came into creation from the Children's Television Act that wanted more educational programming for kids. The entire series run is included on these four discs and to be fair, almost all of them are in pretty good condition. (Only true issue is with the audio for ""By A Whisker"" but is minor at best)

The show stars ACME detectives Zach and Ivy as they tail Carmen Sandiego across the world attempting to catch her. There are plenty of twists and turns along the way including Carmen teaming up with them to foil criminals not as classy as herself.

Plenty of talented voice actors adorn this series including Scott Menville as Zac, Rodger Bumpass as ""The Chief"", Jennifer Hale as Ivy, and the timeless Rita Moreno as Carmen Sandiego. It is one of those series that stands the test of time and while giving you a history lesson, it doesn't throw it in your face.

My only issue is that the series was sadly cancelled before its time and never truly had the ending that it deserved. The best part of the entire deal here on Amazon is that you get nearly 15 hours of video for less than $10 dollars and since it is the entire series run, that can't be under sold. You can find most of the episodes on the Internet but no one truly has the full run of episodes.

What are you waiting for, ""Buy it now!""",1346457600,51,1469,4.366300366300366
5024363,5,B006WNSHUY,This is a cool cartoon. I like how they use the map a lot and it is a very informative series. Thank you.,1344902400,2,105,3.608695652173913
5024364,5,B006WNSHUY,"I remember watching this everyday when I was younger, and the random facts I learned are priceless. I can't believe I got the complete series for less than ten bucks. This is one of those shows that I'm going to treasure forever and share with my kids...whenever I have them.",1343174400,,275,4.52
5024365,5,B006WNSHUY,This is a cartoon from the early 1970s Saturday Morning cartoons - if you are a fan of those good ol cartoon days then you will love this set - for the price you can't beat it.,1339286400,,176,3.7837837837837838
5024366,5,B006WNSHUY,"DVD case was terrible, DVDs are in individual paper slips. Quality was better than expected but don't expect HD considering how old the show is. If you enjoyed the show in the past, I definitely recommend this especially since it's so cheap.",1336608000,,241,4.761904761904762
5024367,5,B006WNSHUY,"The whole series was Great! but I was a little disappointed in the ending""SPOIL ALERT""! Carmen's father gets Amnesia from falling off the roof She never gets her father back after trying to convince him that she is his daughter and Ivy and Zack never catch Her.",1332028800,,261,4.574468085106383
5024368,5,B006WNSHUY,"I just got my copy in the mail today after a short delay of the release. I watched this series as child when it was still airing on FOX in the mid 90's and the show is still just as good as I remembered it. The show is very kid friendly and has a bit of an educational theme. Now let's get to the specs of this DVD.

Approx Runtime: 14hrs and 20 min
Aspect Ratio: 4:3/1:33:1
All 40 episodes on 4 DVD's

The image quality is a bit of a disappointment since they crammed 10 episodes per DVD as well as some bonus features. That said, when I play this on my computer, my DVD fan will run very high because so much space was used on the DVD's. In my opinion, it would've been a lot better if they released this on Blu-Ray. As we all know, Blu-Ray DVD's can hold a lot more space than regular DVD's. Personally, I gladly would have forked over $50 for the complete set (as long as it's in airdate order and uncut) on Blu-Ray either that or they should have put them on more DVD's but I suppose this release will do for now.

The packaging is pretty piss poor. The DVD's come in 4 paper sleeves and a single DVD case. Whoever thought that was a great idea to hold DVD's that way should be fired. This puts the DVD's at risk for scratching and plenty of finger prints. Whatever happened to the days when companies released complete series in actual box sets or thinpak releases?

Unfortunately, this is not in the original airdate order. Is it really that hard to put all the episodes in the correct airdate order? I know I'm just nitpicking but I want to watch the series the same way as it was airing in the 90's. On the plus side, the openings and endings are included on every episode. Overall, this is a decent release and worth picking up for the nostalgia. Hopefully one day, another company will give the series a proper release in the future.

5024374,5,B006WNSHUY,"A blast from my own past as I played the computer game as a child. Now my own nine year old is learning with Carmen, a cultured criminal who is fun and sneaky. I especially like that even though Carmen Sandiego is a ""bad guy"", she goes out of her way to make sure no one is hurt in her heists and she sticks to a very strict code of behavior. It gives her an ethical edges in a sea of children programming where every episode is about fighting.

My child watches this over and over and over, we're thrilled. The case just has the disks stacked on top of each other, it makes it hard to get to later disks, but this is a minor concern.",1510099200,,634,3.9921259842519685

5024377,3,B006WNSHUY,"I thought this was going to be the show I grew up with but they've redone parts of it. There's no live action footage, it's all animated now. Still cute but not what I was hoping for.",1505260800,2,183,3.972972972972973
5024378,3,B006WNSHUY,"This review is for the product and not the show itself. Unless you're one of the idiots who mistook this for the similarly titled game show, you already know this was an awesome cartoon.

My main problem with this is they re-formatted the perspective to fit moden widescreen TVs. This reults in some of the original picture being cropped, and subsequently, some swkward shots. In one scene the heroes are beneath a structure wondering where Carmen Sandiego is. When she shouts down at them from the roof, the camera pans up to show her up to her neck, with her head completely out of shot. They really should have just kept the original square TV format.

Aside from that, the original film doesn't transfer to high def very well. The background images are all well done, but the animation cells themselves suffer from noticeable sharp pixelation on all black lines. Judging from the 380p episodes uploaded to youtube, this appears to be a probpem with the originals which the animators probably thought no one would ever notice (the old TVs smoothed this out a lot). I can't exactly ding the product for that but it's somewhat annoying and something to be aware of.

All in all, a great show that gets dinged a star for reformatting to modern TVs. My kids and I still love the show so we'll gladly live with it.",1503878400,,1312,4.622317596566524

My children do not learn well by just doing reading and writing. One is on the spectrum and the other is gifted I must find other ways of teaching besides simply a textbook and writing. This DVD is great. It was extremely enjoyable for my children and they have watched it several times.

5024440,4,B006WNSHUY,"It is a good animated series although I find it runs through the historical facts and information much too fast to absorb. Kids like it and that is what counts. I asked my kids if they liked it and they said yes but the youngest replied, ""That guy's head following them around on the Ipad is creepy."" haha.",1453939200,,306,4.293103448275862

We homeschool and this year we are learning about the World's Geography and different places, so I thought this would be an exciting way to do that.  I had no idea the excitement and adventure that this series had!  My boys are glued to the tv when this is on!  They have learned so much about geography tidbits and since Carmen is an art thief, they learn about art, and artists, etc. as well.  We watch one episode almost every night, so we have really drawn out the excitement and have enjoyed this for a month now (I am writing this on 1/25/2016).",1453680000,5,628,4.2

5024444,4,B006WNSHUY,"This is such a classic show that stands the test of time. My kids love it and have learned so much from it. We homeschool and instead of just using textbooks and curriculum we use various resources as our foundation for ""curriculum"". We want our kids to enjoy life and learning and learn through doing and living not just reading boring texts and memorizing stuff they care nothing about or can't relate to in any way. How many times did you love when your teacher brought out the film reels and pulled down the projector screen or rolled in the tv cart?. Today with so many options for great kids programming and documentaries there really is no reason not to utilize it more as a learning tool. No, my kids are not just sitting all day watching tv. But the shows they do watch they learn and remember everything. My son tells me ( as well as anyone he sees) random facts about things and I ask him how he knows and he says Wild Kratts or Carmen Sandiego, Magic Schoolbus, Octonauts, etc.

My only issue is the way the multi dvds are packaged. I don't like the envelopes. I would rather it be like other multi dvds and have the flip trays inside or fit more episodes per disc or a blu ray option.",1453075200,2,1197,4.32

I'd never heard about it before and  I thought this could be a fun thing for my 9 year old to watch and maybe he would learn something interesting about the countries in the world.  Turns out, it is fantastic!  He is always asking to watch it and loves telling me about the new countries he has learned about.  Every time Carmen goes to a new country we find it on a map so he has an idea of where it is in relation to us. It's great!  It fits in well with us learning about the continents, countries and the world in general.",1446854400,3,606,4.0588235294117645

We value quality programs that make our kids think and this series certainly does that.  Yes they are a bit outdated as far as technology goes these days but they didn't seem to mind.  The stories are so good it was worth every penny!,1408147200,,389,4.078947368421052

Then we push play, get the answer ans the show goes on.  :)",1404604800,,248,4.23404255319149
5024602,5,B006WNSHUY,My children have no idea they are watching a show from the 90's.  I'm glad I'm able to put something on the television that I do not have to monitor.  The episodes are 25 minutes long and are the perfect calm down (no fight scenes here) before they go off to start showering and bedtime.  The series is interesting to them because of the brother-sister teamwork and the mystery of searching for the elusive Carmen.  What I get out of it is a little bit of education and nothing too racy or ridiculous.  For the price you should just go ahead and buy it.  Forty episodes is a lot.,1404345600,,579,4.26605504587156

I really like the arc when Carmen ends up working together with Zac and Ivy to catch Maelstrom.  My only qualm with this series is the fact that even though you start learning more about Carmen in the final episode, it just ends!  There isn't really an ending!!!  She doesn't get caught, you don't really learn a lot more about her, she doesn't have a random change of heart back to being a detective (something that I think extremely unlikely), nothing!

She even used a fact she learned from watching the 1st disc for ""what she learned today"" at dinner. It's a fun way to learn. We received the order quickly after placing our order. It appears to be in good shape with no skips or pauses in the play. It is a fun way for kids to learn about different places around the globe, including here in the USA, past and present.

One thing I will say contrary to others is that I like that it is the 10 episodes per disk.  For us, travelling in a van, you don't have to swap disks very much on a long trip. To me this is a big plus.  Ok + 1 star.

Some people had commented on the packaging. The version I received came in a plastic case with all the DVDs stacked on top of each other. There were no paper sleeves that others had mentioned.

I know Carmen is an ACME agent gone bad but I was surprised a few times when she saved Zach and Ivy. So she must care a little bit eh?
The Shipping was quick although there was a small delay on the order. The only complaint that I have is that all the CD's are piled on top of one another in the box and that is an easy way for them to get scratched. Now I have to get some paper CD cases or something.

She's more into the locations. Good Series. They've even asked to play the board game my younger sister left at my parents house from her childhood.
The packaging is lacking. The DVD's come in little what I think of as CD paper sleeves.

They seem to have some educational content (my son thought it was neat to see places he has already been and places we have talked about or studied previously) and my son got so into watching them, it was sometimes difficult to get him out of the car at rest stops!

The price is low.  The content is terrific.

Could they have higher quality transfers?  Yeah.  But enh... you just got 40 episodes of Carmen Sandiego stealing stuff from all over the globe for a reasonable price.  It's also a kids show, not super serious.  The fact that they even made the DVD set... that thrilled me alone.

Brought me back to my childhood, learned a little something, and was thoroughly entertained in the process.

And I'll finally get to learn... did Zach + Ivy ever actually catch Carmen?",1366934400,4,539,4.648936170212766
5024816,5,B006WNSHUY,"Where On Earth Is Carmen Sandiego is a cartoon that ran on Saturday mornings from 1994 to 1999. Based on the popular Carmen Sandiego games, each episode has the titular thief committing grandiose crimes as Acme detectives and siblings Ivy and Zach track her down and try capturing the former Acme detective. All the while they occasionally receive help from other detectives and support from Acme chief, appropriately named Chief (who is voiced by the same voice actor that voices Spongebob's Squidward and also looks like a certain Real Ghostbuster...)

As someone who grew up watching the cartoon, it was great to finally get the chance to own it on DVD. The packaging itself I'm not entirely crazy about, as another reviewer also mentioned. The case itself looks great and then when you open it, the actual DVDs are stacked upon each other in cheap paper sleeves. For less than $5, not counting shipping, I suppose you can't expect a whole a lot, but it still would have been nice to have them packaged slightly better. I remember the show Archie's Weird Mysteries, also put out by the same company (which I reviewed last year), was given the same treatment. It's not a big gripe, but nonetheless...

The show itself is still very enjoyable. Not only still entertaining in its own right, but it also has its educational value as well, which is great for young kids. As I said about David the Gnome, the the ability to balance the entertainment and educational aspects seems to have been lost on people responsible for these shows. You have shows like this and David the Gnome and then you look at some shows of a similar nature and it's very noticeable. Such shows now have become ""let's shove it down kids and treat them like idiots' throats!"" But I digress.

I think the show has aged very well.

Bottom line is if you were a fan, the show is still worth a buy, especially with its current pricing.",1366848000,10,1903,4.654761904761905
5024817,5,B006WNSHUY,"I remember this series from my childhood and knew that buying it was a must. What I didn't realize is how much my kids would love it! My kids love watching the episodes and retain so much from them. They actually ask to expand on some of the topics they learned about . . .  which makes this homeschooling mom all giddy. :)

Pros:
Introduces kids to facts from around the world
Make kids want to learn more
Short episodes

Cons:
The discs are in envelopes. :/",1366848000,,459,4.252873563218391
5024818,5,B006WNSHUY,"Okay, first the DVD's themselves- I had NO problems with the quality of the DVDs. Some people complain the DVDs are in little paper black sleeves instead of the common plastic disk holders that somehow attach to the case. WHO CARES?! As long as you're careful and your kids don't go misplacing the black sleeves, it will not affect the quality or content of the DVDs. If this is the reason the price is so low, I'd take it anyday!
Next, the actual content- my kids had a BLAST watching all the DVDs. We're a homeschooling family, we even managed to tie the areas she went to into our history/geography lessons. I nearly pinched myself when I saw these DVDs for the price I paid for them. Why are more parents not buying this?! Seriously?! This show was one of the best educational shows of all time. The 90's were what I'll always consider the golden era of educational television. People were actually trying to use TV to teach kids about stuff they would need to know in school/learn for dare I say FUN!  Granted, the clothes are outdated and the ideas about the ""future""/technology, but most young kids don't really care about that stuff,anyways. I would take outdated clothes over the crap they're passing as educational television now...
Anyways, the show itself is VERY educational. Each show contains at least 1-2 questions that give the kids a chance to see if they remember what they're watching. We would pause it after they posed the question and give the kids a chance to answer because normally there would be a commerical break between the question itself and the answer. My kids recalled quite a bit of information by the question and answer segments alone, but if you ever want to go more in depth, check out the PBS(?) version of the game show on youtube. We did that a few times, the kids loved it.
Carmen goes across the globe and time. You not only learn about geography, but historical events as well. Not just American, but worldly events that I don't think most kids get in their history lessons today.
Even if you don't have kids, it's still a steal of a deal. I got to relive my late elementary years(when the computer game/start of the show was on). It was so cool just to see Carmen ""almost"" getting caught each and every time, while learning about her past(which I completely did not pay attention to when watching this as a kid), and the past of other characters as well.
I can't recommend this enough. If you just want to relive your childhood, it's beyond worth it. If you have kids, it's even more so, because you're giving them quality, unbiased HONESTLY educational television without the fluff of being politically correct or trying to cater to every individual sensitivity known to mankind(like most educational shows today). With this, a globe or a lamenated map, and maybe even youtube(optional) and a few books from the library(optional) you could give your kids a few fun weeks of geography and history while trying to figure out ""Where IS Carmen Sandiego?""
P.S.- the DVDs also include a cartoon version of ""The Secret Garden""(which was so-so), and an episode of ""Liberty's Kids"", another good DVD series that's on my ""buy soon!"" list, because it does a great job of teaching Colonial American history.
My only question now is...where DID she go?!?! ;)",1366761600,,3292,4.695501730103806

Educational trivia and fun action at the same time.

Price is GREAT for all 40 episodes!(currently less than $6)

Rita Moreno's voice was perfect for the clever, stylish, former detective turned thief, Carmen.

While I do enjoy the series, I have notied that Ivy comes off very butch for being such a kids show and Zach is too much of a lazy butt. While they work well together and show they do care about one another, I feel their individual roles are a little overplayed.

And the campy Cheese the chief pours on all the time can get annoying if you are watching several episodes in a row.

While I will suggest adding this to your library, most of the facts are still very relevant and can help young and old with some history, geography as well as introduce them to some other diverse cultures. Take it in small doses.",1361145600,9,853,4.285714285714286

5024857,5,B006WNSHUY,Can't say enough great stuff about this set/show. My boys ages 8 & 3 would watch this all day if I'd let them and I don't mind letting them watch a couple of episodes back to back because they are learning from it too.,1360281600,,218,3.977272727272727
5024858,4,B006WNSHUY,"I had never seen the animated series, but I used to watch the game show.  This is still a fun show with lots of interesting facts, but the theme music is completely different (I miss Rockapella!) and wouldn't be as engaging for younger kids.

5024860,5,B006WNSHUY,"Although the animation seems to be on ""early 80s"" level, these series do provide lots of interesting facts from various areas. The plot is built around situations when Carmen is attempting to steal various historical objects all across the world while two kids are always there to stop her from doing that. While ""investigating"" a case, each episode introduces a history and other details associated with each respective item and/or place. Probably will work best for kids 8+.",1357948800,,476,5.115384615384615

I'm still waiting on the whole ""Wishbone"" series about the cute dog, his life, and adventures into classic books to be put out on DVD. The cartoon version is great, but the gameshow version of ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"" theme song still plays in my head. Worth it.

Please come out with a complete series of Wishbone on DVD next! Thanks.",1356566400,,408,4.44
5024878,5,B006WNSHUY,I remember this series from the 1990s.  Now I have a 7 year old who loves geography.  This show is great as my son learns varies facts about different places following the ACME detectives as they chase the master criminal Carmen Sandiego around the world.  He also learns reasoning skills by putting clues together given throughout the show.  Even my 5 year old got into this series picking up different facts.,1356566400,2,410,4.732394366197183

5024880,5,B006WNSHUY,My six year old and my four year old love the video.  It is not only fun but educational so I do not feel so bad about them watching it for more than 30 minutes.  Each episode gives a good lead into discussions into history and geography.,1356307200,18,238,4.042553191489362

5024894,5,B006WNSHUY,"Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego is an educational cartoon in which the most famous world crook (Sandiego) pulls of the most daring heists (such as stealing the eyes off of the portrait of Van Gogh or stealing Cathrine the Great's statue from Russia) where she takes famous landmarks, ruins, paintings, etc. All of it in a spirit of playing an intellectually challenging game against two teenaged detectives Zac and Ivy (a brother and sister duo detective act from ACME).

This cartoon takes the viewer (young and older) on trips around the world with Ivy and Zac to track down Carmen. Usually the episodes begin with Carmen completing a theft and then leaving clues for the detectives to pick up on. As the two try to figure them out, Carmen endeavors to set a theme to her crime of the day and complete it for a playful twist of some kind. We as the viewers learn history, geography, and other cultures as the clues unfurl and lead us ever closer to that Carmen Sandiego.

The voices, art, and humor all come together to create excitement and laughter and make it all look good. Where as there are serious points that highlight key moral issues for the viewers to contemplate to add counter balance. Such as cases where the siblings must work to save Sandiego or work with her to complete an end and fight against something much worse than a famous thief. And the creators decided to give Carmen a strict sense of morality in which she doesn't hurt people, doesn't really want to have them hurt.

Overall, this is educational and fun. And while I can't say this is a substitute for reading, studying, and genuinely taking an interest in these things, it at least will pave the way for curiosity and what not. Heck, did for me. Part of my studying archeology is because of programs like this.

Highly recommend!",1355011200,3,1813,4.62111801242236

5024896,5,B006WNSHUY,"So I grew up watching this cartoon, and I was really happy to hear it was going to be relesead as a complete series edition (since until last year you could buy only some episodes).
Carmen Sandiego is a great way for kids learn something about other cultures and for grown ups to test their own knowledge on the topic, as well as of great entertaining value.
Buy it. now.",1353888000,,371,4.314285714285714

5024898,5,B006WNSHUY,"So I bought  ""Where on Earth is Carmen San Diego""  last week and it  arrived in the mail this week. I have  the  amazon  prime membership  so I was able to choose the free  2 day  shipping. I got it  very quickly and was happy about that.

I remember watching this tv show on Fox Kids way back in the 90s. I liked the show then and understood a chunk of it but not all.

Now in my 20s I fully understand it and the information it provides. I must say I like Zack and Ivy, the  gumshoes that get the stolen items back but never are quite quick enough to catch carmen. Even though eventually they do catch her for a short time.

The show  provides an endless amount of facts about people and places. I  always feel like I am learning something and not just simply being entertained. Though it does a good job at doing that too!

The chief keeps things even more interesting with his over the wall personality.

I have to say my favorite character is Carmen herself, even though she is the bad guy. She makes  stealing seem cool due to her always calm demeanor and last minute escapes. She always seems to have at least one more trick up her sleeve. It is fun to watch her out maneuver the everyone again and again. She steals for the challenge of it and  this makes her stick out more than your common thief.

The show feels like it should have been on  pbs but has enough action and animation to support it being on fox at the time. This is a wonderful show point blank.

The suspense and action are real so you feel like the show is actually taking place in real life.

I haven't seen all the episodes on the dvd, but I am glad to own the whole series. Now I can watch it whenever I want. I think it would be cool to see this series converted into a live action movie with the  right actors of course.

Until next crime...",1353888000,,1822,4.119658119658119

5024900,5,B006WNSHUY,"Great show - brings back memories - 40 episodes for $7? I couldn't pass it up! Great show for kids - lots of educational value - lots of trivia, facts, geography, etc.",1353369600,,167,4.25
5024901,5,B006WNSHUY,"A superb educational, yet entertaining series. This show is the perfect blend of both of these things.

All 40 episodes are present over 4 discs (That's 10 episodes on each). Though for some reason Mill Creek included a couple of odd extras. A bonus film 'The Secret Garden' (not the Live Action version from Warner Bros. obviously) and a bonus episode of a cartoon called 'Liberty's Kids (Est 1776)'. Probably because one is educational and the other is based off a book, but still they haven't really got much to do with the set itself.

So apart from a couple of odd extras, this set is a very worthwhile and affordable set. Perfect for those who are into Geography, a bit of history and even those who find this show a guilty pleasure who just wants a plesent trip down memory lane.",1353024000,,786,4.528169014084507
5024902,5,B006WNSHUY,"This movie provides an almost instantaneous connection point between our kids and any other kids who have seen the videos.  They just seem to glom together and have something to talk about right away.  This is somewhat remarkable -- even my non-chattiest child can talk about the action in Carmen Sandiego.  I was noticing the other day when we had a new family over for a meal and suddenly the kids were out talking about this and having fun.

Plenty of stuff gets learned -- mostly of the trivia variety, but also the video highlights the formulaic detective story and some foreshadowing.  This is good on a lot of levels.",1352160000,,624,4.636363636363637
