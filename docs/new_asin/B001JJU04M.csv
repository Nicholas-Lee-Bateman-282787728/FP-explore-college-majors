8312995,5,B001JJU04M,UNBELIEVABLE DVD.  Vintage Subdudes at their BEST!,1436486400,,50,6.142857142857143
8312996,5,B001JJU04M,"The Subdudes are one of the most talented & creative, yet, under appreciated groups in America. It's not as good as seeing them perform live at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, but it's damn close.",1315353600,,206,4.594594594594595
8312997,5,B001JJU04M,"Unless you are SOLELY into death-metal, gangsta rap, or hardcore punk, purchase this DVD and you will not be disappointed.  I purchased one CD by these guys in the mid-90's and enjoyed it quite a bit, but then lost track of the band.  In 2006, I saw them live in concert.  As it turned out, they only played 1 song that I knew, but it was as good as any concert I've ever seen.  These guys are extremely talented musicians who play whatever the ---- they want to play with deft and soul.  I've been to hundreds of shows at clubs, stadiums, and arenas, and no other group/artist moved me more than The Dudes!  As a bonus, I could have written the same review for Los Lobos.  If you've never seen them, check them out now (their live DVD is good, but doesn't do nearly as good a job of capturing the magic of a live show like the Dudes DVD does).  Peace.",1312848000,,852,4.184049079754601
8312998,5,B001JJU04M,"What can I say, these guys are awesome. I can't seem to get enough of these guys. I have purchased every album they have. Hope you enjoy!!!",1232150400,3,139,4.185185185185185
8312999,5,B001JJU04M,"For those who know the band, this set is a must. There are interviews with each member and some songs on the first disc and a live show on the second. Both are well done and will give the neophyte fan a good feeling of what it's like to see this fantastic group ""up close and personal"". Plus, for those who want to learn the guitar parts, you can watch Tommy's chord changes on a lot of the tunes. I was pickin' along and it was fun!",1226448000,5,433,3.9885057471264367
