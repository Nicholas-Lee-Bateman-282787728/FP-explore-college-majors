3791341,4,B001TK80CU,"This is a decent release of Cronenberg's ""M Butterfly"".Nothing special but at least it's finally on DVD.

As for the film,critics seem to love it or hate it. I like the fact that the story has Cronenberg's trademark color scheme,Shore's always-amazing score,and the great artistic talent of Jeremy Irons. Not an earth-shatteringly amazing film,but it's not supposed to be huge in scope.",1244419200,3,386,5.225806451612903
3791342,5,B001TK80CU,"Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly is the catalyst behind this fictional version of the bizarre true story of the relationship between Bernard Borsicot, a French diplomat, and Shi Pei-Pu, a Peking opera singer.  In the film and play, Bernard Borsicot becomes Rene Gallimard, a low-level accountant at a French embassy, who is promoted to head of embassy intelligence after he inadvertently ruffles some feathers among the espionage staff.  The real-life Shi Pei-Pu is known as Song Liling, a singer at the Beijing opera, although the actual events took place in Peking.  With a background set among the chaos of China just prior to and during the Cultural revolution, the affair between Boriscot/Gallimard and Pei-Pu/Lilang is used to frame a well-crafted and extremely well-acted story of espionage, love, betrayal, obsession and, ultimately, a dramatic reversal of the tragedy of Madama Butterfly.

Unlike some, I believe that Borsicot/Gallimard probably did not know, or certainly did not want to know, that Shi/Song was really a man.  I found John Lone as Song very convincing indeed, even though as a gay man I am very used to being around transgender people, many of whom are not even remotely as credible as Mr. Lone.  What is less credible is how young Song looks when she is finally revealed as a man during the brief courtroom scene, since their affair was supposed to last over 30 years, and John Lone appears to be in his late twenties during the trial scene.  But this is a minor quibble; the irony of the climactic ending may be lost on anyone who is unfamiliar with the opera that the story parallels, but this does not detract from the compelling nature of the film.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially Ian Richardson as the Ambassador and Barbara Sukowa as Gallimard's wife.

A word about the title, which many people refer to as ""M Butterfly"", as if the letter ""M"" were itself a word.  In French, ""M."" is the abbreviation for ""Monsieur"", and the title of the film and play are properly pronounced ""Monsieur Butterfly"".  Thus the irony of the climax is instantly comparable to the opera.  Highly recommended.",1243641600,34,2133,4.943977591036415

3791373,3,B001TK80CU,"Bernard Boursicot was a French diplomat.  While stationed in China in the 1960s, he met Peking opera singer Shi Pei Pu, who used the relationship to communicate French information about American activities in the far east to the Chinese government.  Although the two were separated in the late 1970s, when Boursicot returned to France, Shi Pei Pu followed him to Paris, resumed the relationship, and brought pressure upon him to actively participate in acts of espionage against France.  They were brought to trial in 1986, and the general outline of their story and relationship became the basis for playwright David Henry Hwangs M. BUTTERFLY, which debuted on Broadway in 1988, winning the Tony Award for Best Play and giving seven hundred seventy-seven performances.  The in turn became the basis of a 1993 film directed by David Cronenberg and starring Jeremy Irons, John Lone, Ian Richardson, and Barbara Sukowa.

Cronenberg is probably best known to the general public as the director of THE DEAD ZONE, THE FLY, and A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, but over the years he has built a significant reputation for combining mainstream genres such as horror and science-fiction with art house sensibilities.  The resulting films, like NAKED LUNCH with its surrealist flourishes and the highly controversial and often censored CRASH (not to be confused with the like-named Oscar winner), have brought him considerable acclaim.  Given the extremely theatrical style of Hwangs play, he would seem a good choice to translate the play to film.  Unfortunately, what we get is a near-miss that actually softens the plays sharp edges.

I think part of the problem is star Jeremy Irons in the role based on Boursicot.  Irons has a number of powerful moments in the film, and his ultimate confrontation with lover Song Liling is remarkable for its mixture of beauty and pain.  Unfortunately, however, Irons plays to his own stereotype as a sort of poetic elegance that renders most of the film extremely predictable, and I think a more burly, less fragile-seeming actor would have been a better choice.  Co-star John Lone steals the film, and Ian Richardson scores heavily in the role of the French ambassador, but in truth Cronenberg throws away much of what made the original play so fascinating.

The imagery is beautiful, but it unwinds at a slow pace that is increasingly tiresome as the movie progresses, and the political edge, the themes of east and west, the shift between Madame Butterfly and Monsieur Butterfly, and how Song Liling ensnares the Boursicot character by playing upon what he wants to see, what he expects to seeall of this is largely lost.  So too is the shock when the characters, suddenly shorn of illusions and disguise, confront each other at the films climax.  Ultimately, the film version of M. BUTTERFLY is a somewhat sleepy, highly romanticized, and mildly exotic love story with a twist more likely to cause a yawn than a raised eyebrow.  Worth seeing, but perhaps worth seeing only once.

3791378,5,B001TK80CU,"I own all of the David Cronenberg's movie on DVD. Sadly no blurays. But dvds. But not this one before yesterday. Becuse 1. I don't like westerners talking about Asian without knowing deeply or just having this fantasy about them telling storieies just with their own view. 2. It was kind of uncomfortable for me to see John Lone acting as a woman when I was really young.
But now that I decided to buy this dvd, I watched it again. The fact that the script was written by a Chinese guy but the director is David has not been changed and Jeremy Irons with his innocent looking searching for this mysterious Chinese man(Woman) who is a Chinese opera singer trying to seduce her(him) is not so beautiful. He just loves her(him) because he has this fantasy of his own. That is pity somehow.
But the setting and the music made me not regret buying this dvd.
Also John Lone's sincronization to the woman was almost let's say 90% woman which is amazing. His voice, his look, his movement and everything.
Jeremy is always a good actor and he is in this movie too.
The ending when he was in jail putting his thick makeup just like Chinese opera singer and talking about what he've done through was kind of really corney somehow but at the end when he stabs himself and dies, I felt truely sad and felt sorry for him.
Also during going to the jail, when John Lone and Jeremy Irons are riding the same car, first John Lone looked like he was mocking at Jeremy that he was totally tricked by him by thinking that he was a woman, but at the end we can see that he truely loved him. Which is kind of touchy.
This movie is beautifully shot and I cannot deny that the actors acted very well. Well enought to make the audience believe what they have to believe.
Even the fact that Jeremy didn't know that John Lone was a man and never took off his clothes during having sex. They just had anal sex only and he didn't even felt the difference between the As and Vs. Which is the only one that I cannot believe.
After all, this movie is a good classic work but not totally David Cronenberg's taste.",1459900800,,2079,4.319693094629156

3791412,5,B001TK80CU,"M. BUTTERFLY continues to rank among the more important cinematic adaptations of a brilliant play - this one by the playwright David Henry Hwang. Having the pleasure to see two productions of the play - New York and Los Angeles - and viewing the film (1993) in the theater and on Amazon Instant Video brings an immense amount of satisfaction of just how fine this work is and continues to satisfy. The fact that David Henry Hwang wrote the screenplay suggests how true to the original the film is and how much of an impact it makes on the viewer

M. BUTTERFLY is based on a true story that stunned the world. During the Cultural Revolution in China in the mid-1960s, a French diplomat Ren&eacute; Gallimard (a brilliant portrayal by Jeremy Irons) falls in love with a Chinese opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) - women were never allowed to sing in the Beijing Opera so the fact that Song is a man is credible. Song Liling touches him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly. The love affair is so fragile and respectful that Ren&eacute; does not suspect that Song is a man in disguise. Ren&eacute; Is an important diplomat with the French Embassy, married to Jeanne (Barbara Sukowa), and is responsible for maintaining the high standards of diplomacy. Song Liling has been placed in the position of an undercover agent to gather secrets from the Embassy about the American plans in Vietnam. As Ren&eacute; is promoted he demands to see his M. Butterfly without her clothes, an Song's only protection about her gender identity is to reveal that she is pregnant with Ren&eacute;'s child and must leave to be with her family until the child is born. AS the Cultural Revolution heightens the French Embassy is to be diminished and it is discovered that Ren&eacute; has been in a liaison with with a Chinese spy and is sent back to France to be imprisoned. When he is put on trial Song appears in Paris to be placed on the witness stand and since years have passed since their last meeting, Song attempts to offer herself once again to be Ren&eacute;'s Butterfly. Whether or not Ren&eacute;'s passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life. Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress--as well as his jailer. In a desperately touching final scene we see the imprisoned Ren&eacute; perform the final act from the opera that has accompanied this film - Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY.

The story is at once compelling, explosive and slyly humorous, 'a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes--and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.' The musical score by Howard Shore integrates arias and choruses from Puccini's opera with music from Chinese opera and his own sensuously beautiful original musical score. David Cronenberg directs with the tight amount of surreal disbelief the piece needs, but it is the brilliant acting of Jeremy Irons and John Lone that illuminate this film. It is a masterwork.

3791413,5,B001TK80CU,"I've just viewed M. Butterfly, twice in fact.  Jeremy Irons' performance is quite good; he always delivers as he is now in his role as Pope in The Borgias.  But the performance that transfixed me was that of John Lone.  I cannot think of a more extraordinary performance.  He should have won an Academy Award for so fully and believably transmuting himself into a woman.  Every movement, his walk, the use of his hands, his eyes, and above all his voice were in every way feminine.  Only a tremendously gifted actor could deliver such a superb performance.  And his last scene in the police truck, when he strips and kneels before Irons, well, I can't find the words to describe how powerful, moving and heart-rending Lone's acting is.  Yes, Lone indeed did ""become"" a woman, and he did indeed fall in love.  What Irons' character felt, is a tragic irony.  Yes, he fell in love with an image, but it was not a lie.  He fell in love with the essence of the man Lone represented, and it included the man's anima.  Only a man in tune with his anima could deliver such a nuanced performance.  And then the very last scene with Irons, here he matches Lone in his performance.  Both actors were wonderful, but I have to give Lone the edge: His role was the more challenging, and he does not fail, in fact he more than succeeds.  He is a truly gifted actor.",1335225600,3,1350,4.430894308943089

It was a good film that included all of the parts of the play but I did not like the director's take on Song. This is of course, my personal opinion based on how I read the play. In my reading I saw Song as being much more complex and ambiguous in how they saw themselves and the purpose they did everything (I realize this is vague but I am trying not to spoil anything). I also would have liked it better if Gallimard had been narrating like the playwright because it helps convey more complexity in my opinion. Four stars because as a film by itself I probably would have really enjoyed it.",1523923200,,691,4.203007518796992

The setting is the early years following the Chinese revolution and the period through the Cultural Revolution.  A married French diplomat falls in love with a beautiful opera singer.

Cronenbergs films focus on the body, the senses, the complexity of ourselves which are exposed to so much stimuli and input and often irreconcilably altered. M. BUTTERFLY (1993) is Cronenberg at his most delicate. There is nothing supernatural or extraterrestrial in this film but boundaries are pushed past the usual limits in terms of erotic attraction, capacity for intimacy and outward image as contrasted by inward biology. Without the use of drugs or mutating viruses or ultra sonic frequencies Cronenberg demonstrates that the dynamics between our expectations and reality are what effect is most deeply and at times fatally. Jeremy Irons is flawless as he reaches levels of empathy that would shock most men into nervous dismissal of the whole premise. As if sensing this the auteurs wisely place the climactic denouement in front of a captive audience of hardened convicts, a scenario that gives every indication that the catharsis so desperately needed by character and audience is in dire jeopardy.

Though certainly not one of Cronenbergs bloodier films, when the crimson flowed I had to look away. Drop for drop the human cost has never been higher.

Essential viewing.
