6758295,5,B00OPCF3EW,"I have told everyone I know about this film. In my book club, we all agreed we'd get the list of music we'd want and get it loaded on an ipod or some such so it's ready in the unlikely event it's needed. We needed to say ""unlikely"" to help us feel better and then we realized listening to it now would help us feel better! So, we are all loading up! Meanwhile...the film is like watching a miracle unfold. Inspiring, instructive, and it resonates at some level beyond words. There is WAY more to what you see in this film and what that is will be left with you for a long time to come.",1416355200,17,585,4.051724137931035
6758296,5,B00OPCF3EW,"Astonishing. Scintillating.  That a guy who is not a musician or initially an elder caregiver could penetrate so deep into our human world, bypassing the medical infrastructure with all its resources to create a pathway of such power is beyond nspiring.  It means anything is possible.  Now onto the real work of transforming our culture and its institutions.

6758299,5,B00OPCF3EW,"I was very deeply moved by this film, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, feeling joy and hope and inspiration.  This is the most stirring documentary and film I have ever seen.  It has inspired me to make it a  mission to spread the Music and Memory program to as many memory care centers as possible.  My mother had Alzheimer's and seeing her response to familiar music showed me the promise of this program.  This incredible film shows not only the results of bringing personalized music to those with memory impairment but also the brain research behind it and the general improvement of quality of life for both the person with dementia and for that person's family.  You will not regret seeing this film and may find yourself similarly inspired.  I've started making my personal music list for if and when I may need to have access to that music to bring me back alive and I have begun to add my favorite music to my daily life at the start of each day and find I am much better off for this small change in my daily routine!",1415750400,95,1033,4.491978609625669
6758300,5,B00OPCF3EW,"Please watch this movie and spread the word about the powerful impact music can have for people with dementia. After this movie was shown here at the Berkshire International Film Festival (where it won the audience award like it did at Sundance), a man called me who, inspired by seeing it, wanted to do the work it documents. He's been coming to the dementia community where I work for a few months with indisputable success. The message in this film needs to be spread so that many many people with dementia can benefit. As a colleague said,"" I challenge anyone to be downcast or grumpy when listening to his/her favorite music.""
Michael Bennett and Dan Cohen have done a huge service for the community of people with dementia and their caregivers.",1415750400,31,750,4.732824427480916
6758301,5,B00OPCF3EW,An amazing documentary about the effects of music on people who have Alzheimer's disease and other mental issues such as dementia. It's a must-see!,1415750400,12,147,5.166666666666667
6758302,5,B00OPCF3EW,"I recently saw Alive Inside at the 2014 Rehoboth Beach Film Festival.  About halfway through, I realized I was watching my favorite movie of the year.  Not surprisingly, it received the Festival's Audience Award for Best Documentary, just as it did at the Sundance Film Festival.  I liked this movie so much that I ordered copies of the DVD from Amazon so I could share it with others.

Written and directed by Michael Rossato Bennett, Alive Inside follows Dan Cohen on his quest to improve the lives of nursing home patients, especially those suffering from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.  Presently, patients are ""warehoused"" and fed medications to keep them sedated and manageable, still alive physically, but asleep inside, and no longer able to enjoy life.  Cohen, a social worker with a technical savvy for how mobile devices can actually benefit mankind, is the founder of Music and Memory, two words that define this film.

Cohen's approach is based on findings of neurological scientists that (1) we are hard-wired at birth to feel the beat (literally our heart beats) and (2) the area of the brain that responds to, and recalls music, is one of the last areas of the brain to succumb to Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia.

Cohen visits with mainly Alzheimer's patients, but also patients suffering from other illnesses.  He identifies the music most popular in their youth; personalizes this music into an iPod playlist tailored to each patient's interests; then puts earphones on these patients, starts their iPods, and watches what happens.

What happens is remarkable.  People who are unresponsive suddenly become ALIVE INSIDE as the music awakens memories in their lives.  They are happy again: smiling, talking, moving to the beat, and speaking in coherent sentences.  They are remembering and enjoying life once again.

The message is clear:  The Nursing Home setup we now have is a failure, and will soon be completely overwhelmed as Baby Boomers dramatically swell the ranks of those who develop dementia and Alzheimer's.  And Baby Boomers are not about to enter these Prisons for the Elderly without putting up a fight.  The system has to change, and I'm convinced that Dan Cohen's ideas will help cause a revolution in how the elderly, particularly those with the many forms of dementia, will live out their lives.

This is a remarkable film.  I applaud the director, Michael Rossato Bennett, who wrote and directed this movie.  He originally agreed to film Dan Cohen for only one day as Cohen tried out his ideas in a nursing home.  After seeing the results, he had the good sense to stick with Cohen, and ended up making a movie that will be hard to forget.

Alive Inside will tug at your emotions.  You'll be watching scenes that simultaneously make you smile as you watch people come alive, and just as quickly, find yourself brushing away tears of joy for seeing this happen.

I absolutely love this movie.  I will be shocked if it doesn't get an Oscar Nomination for Best Documentary Film.",1415664000,66,3031,4.919291338582677

I had made a playlist on an iPod for my father, who has dementia, and after watching this movie, I'm excited to expand on what we can do to make his world better. Music truly does open up a mind that has partially shut down due to dementia. One afternoon, I watched as my father listened to the music, watched him moving his hands in time to the music (a Broadway show tune), and - at the end of the song - spread his hands for the finale. It was so moving.
I bought this to show my sister. I know she will be as excited as I was.

6758360,5,B00OPCF3EW,"My father was a band director for 30+ years, he was a wonderful piano player, and he also had a jazz combo that he played in at night and on weekends when he was younger.  Because he has been in a nursing home with dementia/Alzheimer's for over four years, because I had been making him (and my mother--who visits and cares for him daily) a playlist of the old jazz standards and of many of his high school band songs, I was absolutely THRILLED to see this documentary!!  I had just bought a small MP3 player, which I planned to return when I found out that it didn't have Bluetooth capability, but when a coworker shared her excitement at seeing ""Alive Inside"" (which she told me about merely because I asked her about having the same MP3 player clipped to her collar), I rented and watched this documentary that weekend on-line.  The movie was like a miracle!  I decided to keep this MP3 player and put the playlist I had been working on for months on it.  My husband and I went and bought headphones the next morning and went to visit him (and my Mom) at the nursing home that day.  My father, who is practically a vegetable, began to sing after he had the headphones on for a while.  He also cried several times.  It was like a miracle!!
  When I see all the people sitting in the halls at this home, I think about how much their lives could be enhanced with their own playlists!!  They (it is true) are so drugged up so they can be managed that all they do is sit, stare, and sleep.  Music with iPods and headphones are a perfect way to reach them!
  I had bought my father an internet radio so we could stream jazz stations for him--we no longer have a local jazz radio station.  The Wifi in the nursing home, though, was so bad/spotty that the radio could not be used there.  Having a personalized playlist on an MP3 player and headphones, however, allows him to experience his love of music.  What a gift!!!!!",1474675200,4,1917,4.339887640449438

I think the ideas and techniques presented here will be a lifesaver for many.  I wish I had seen it in 2014 when it came out.  As I watched this, I just kept thinking, this is the most amazing thing I have ever seen related to the topic of dementia and other similar suffering.  I would highly recommended this to anyone and everyone, as we all know or we will know people in this situation, and of course, it may happen to any of us as well.  The only thing they did not address as much as I would have liked in this film, is how much the human contact with the people who were actually providing the music to those who were suffering, mattered.

6758403,5,B00OPCF3EW,"I work as a musician at assisted living facilities, many of which have Alzheimer's care. While all residents and patients respond to music activities that our duo provide, the Alzheimer's patients are [generally] more responsive. This video has both reinforced and changed the way we provide entertainment to the Alzheimer's patients.

Others have described the video in great detail, so I am going to skip that and get to some of the lessons and ideas we got from it. Foremost, music does make a difference, but it has to be music that reaches the patients.

Many of our audiences have a 20 year range of ages, usually from around seventy to ninety, so we have to carefully select songs that will trigger a response in segments of the audience.  Not every song will be meaningful to each audience member, but if we manage to elicit a response from each (or the majority) of them during our one-hour performances, then we feel as though we have accomplished something.

Moreover, even among patients in the same age range, there will be large variations in songs and arrangements that reach them. Some respond to classical, some to show tunes and others to popular music of their era (and childhood in some cases). I am mentioning this because if you are using this video as a blueprint for putting together activities that use music as therapy (live or using individual MP3 players), there is a process of elicitation to discover which music will trigger responses from the patient. Obviously it's much easier to tailor individual programs to individual patients than to perform and hope to reach most of them. But regardless, the selection of music is an important element to making the information in the video actionable.

This video is also useful to family care givers who are involved with parents or other family members who are suffering Alzheimer's (or dementia). Music can draw them out of the 'fog' so to speak and make them more interactive and cogent, at least for short periods.

Honestly, I have had to rewatch this a few times to let the information sink in. It has certainly made a difference in how I not only approach entertaining in the assisted living facility setting, but in how I perceive my role as going beyond entertainment and performance. Hopefully this video will make the same difference for others, and at least provide some glimmer of hope or a deeper understanding.",1461715200,9,2400,4.841463414634147
6758404,5,B00OPCF3EW,"Fabulous film!  Content-rich and moving vignettes that illustrate beautifully the power of music to stimulate memory, motor and verbal skills, and sense of identity.

Dan Cohen is such a person and in this moving documentary you get to see how music unlocks the memory of almost catatonic patients. At first they seem to have no interest in living, but as soon as they start listening to music on an iPod they brighten up and start talking. I found this very inspirational and enjoyable to watch.

The content is there but it's a shame that the film wasn't subtitled for the hearing-impaired. She herself wears hearing aids & said it was difficult to understand because a much of the dialogs are between non-professional (from a film standpoint) hospice workers & the elderly themselves. Many of her fellow caregivers are volunteer retirees in their 60's & 70's who not only donate time caring for the elderly but are starting to face neurologic & early Alzheimers & dementia issues themselves.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a loved one suffering from memory loss and to all of us as we approach the years in which we assume this will affect us all.

Letting go of their walkers and dancing, smiling, singing and remembering.  Although watching through tears, it also instilled a sense of hope that there are other untapped options that we don't fully understand, which can be used to benefit people with alzheimers or who are slowly retreating into their own world.  I certainly hope this program continues to reach more and more people so this impossibly simple solution (with no negative side affects) can be given as a gift to affect many lives in a positive way.

6758543,4,B00OPCF3EW,"Michael Rossato-Bennetts documentary Alive Inside follows the activities of Dan Cohen, social worker and founder of the nonprofit organization Music and Memory, who provides people with dementia, with an iPod so that they can listen to their favorite songs. The changes that their personal music can bring to them are simply amazing.

Music evokes and enhances our emotions. This is not new news, you know, but the power of music is rarely shown as eloquently as here. You have to see it for yourself.

Among those who are interviewed are famous neurologist Oliver Sacks and musician Bobby McFerrin, but what they have to say about brain and music is not particularly insightful or informative.

The film (only 78 minutes) tries to cover such important social issues as the modern healthcare system (especially for senior citizens) or aging population. The film makes the point that things are not going well, and I agree with that, but its argument is too short.

I give one less star because I wanted to know more about this fascinating topic. How do the caretakers find the personal music of each person? Does this method always work?
