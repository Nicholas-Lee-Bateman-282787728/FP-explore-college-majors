8753747,5,B01CQ8U1EI,"I was so intrigued by this tightly woven tale that I got the book on which it is based, Q&A, which was, as is usually the case, a slightly different story. They are both wrought with excellence in the art of storytelling, and together provide a distinctly unromantic look at some of the subcultures of India today and how they relate to one another. I learned things I didn't know - didn't want to know - and have been pondering this portrait of humanity ever since. It speaks to the quality of acting that I was completely drawn into the drama. Dev Patel delivers a convincing character who is endearing in the face of horrifying circumstances.",1496448000,,645,4.568965517241379
8753748,5,B01CQ8U1EI,"Great movie that I wanted to share with my daughter. Love this story of how one boy's act of kindness developed into one of endless love with a fantastic plot centered on the Indian version of the television game show, ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."" Interesting and often sad backdrop of Indian poverty and how the characters struggles to survive and find their place in society. Not to give anything away from this Academy Award winning film, well worth the watch. BTW - my daughter thoroughly enjoyed it.",1489968000,,508,4.719101123595506
