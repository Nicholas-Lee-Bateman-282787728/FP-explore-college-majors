3722999,5,B001NRY6MW,"WOW!  The Blind Boys of Alabama prove that they're the undisputed kings of Gospel-Rock!  This DVD is on fire and it's almost like being at Tipitina's down in New Orleans.  I saw the band live and they were great but with all these special guests and the horn section added in, this DVD is really over the top!  I recommend this for anyone who loves live music and especially Blind Boys fans.  This is a 'must have'!",1236729600,5,415,4.337662337662338
3723000,5,B001NRY6MW,"THIS DVD CONTAINS SOME GREAT SOUTHERN GOSPEL (""BLIND BOYS FROM ALABAMA STYLE""), WITH A NEW ORLEANS FLAVOR (""PLENTY OF RYTHUM & BLUES & SOME JAZZ""). Plus you get guest musicians of Susan Tedeschi (She is an outstanding blues vocalist), Dr. John (a New Orleans musical legend), The Preservation Hall Jazz Band (A long time New Orleans treasure), plus Henry Butler & Marva Wright (Two more New Orleans musical legends).  Total run time is approx. 100 minutes. THIS IS ONE GREAT CONCERT DVD!!!! THESE GUYS CAN REALLY HARMONIZE GOOD TOGETHER. Some of the ""Blind Boys"" play musical instuments, and also, you get plenty of back-up musicians. THIS IS A GREAT CONCERT!!!

The ""Blind Boys"" have won 4 grammy awards, plus a 2009 grammy lifetime achievement award.

The Blind Boys of Alabama are a ""Southern Treasure"" and a ""National Treasure"". Although, the name of the band includes ""Blind Boys"", these are real men, with a great gospel message. The Blind Boys from Alabama have been performing for years.

This dvd is was filmed at the famous ""Tipitina's Music Club"" in the ""Crescent City"" of New Orleans. You get a concert performance of 16 great songs. Some of the highlights include ""Free at Last"", ""Down by the Riverside"", ""Amazing Grace"", and ""People get Ready"".

You get some great bonus material also, including the music video of ""Free at Last"" filmed in New Orleans. Also, somewhere in the dvd, you get commentaries from members in the band. These guys have a wonderful attitude. One of them said, ""I'm not blind, I just can't see"". These guys are great period!!!! These guy's are ""heaven-bound"". This concert leaves you with a great feeling. If you want that ""great-feeling"", then buy this dvd, it'll make you feel good!!! If you like music, you'll love this one, and I highly recommend it!!!! Thanks!!!",1235779200,8,1804,4.901639344262295

Seamlessly blending gospel, blues & contemporary R & B, the Blind Boys deliver a very inspiring 100 minute show. Set list includes, Amazing Grace, Spirit in the Sky, Down By the Riverside and I'll Fly Away. Great sound and camera work capture their top notch band and well chosen guest stars.

8327855,5,B001NRY6MW,"The only thing better than a Blind Boys CD is a concert DVD. I love their music, and their enthusiasm, so seeing a live concert  is a great joy to me. The song selection (You Gotta Move is my favorite), the guest artists: Susan Tedeschi, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Henry Butler, Dr. John and Marva Wright are excellent. Tedeschi knocks it out of the park in Free at Last and People Get Ready and the group's renditions of Amazing Grace--to the tune of House of the Rising Sun, no less--and Spirit in the Sky couldn't be better. If you love rockin' gospel music this is a must, and if you don't, then this DVD is the way to learn to love it. You'll get your money's worth and more--including extras like the making of the BET TV show. Buy it. Watch it. Love it!",1403481600,,762,4.291666666666667

8327859,5,B001NRY6MW,"New Orleans lives and the Blind Boys of Alabama aren't blind, they just can't see.  Like many movie goers my first exposure to the Blind Boys of Alabama was seeing them in the opening of ""White Men Can't Jump.""  This DVD is a live concert where the Blind Boys of Alabama perform their own renditions of popular songs with spiritual overtones from several genres.  Songs like, ""Spirit in the Sky"", ""Amazing Grace"", ""People Get Ready"",""Down by the Riverside"" and ""Free at Last.""  There aren't many DVDS that I've played through twice the first time but this is one of them and I've enjoyed it several times since. Susan Tedeschi's guitar is also fantastic as well as everyone else.",1299974400,,679,4.728813559322034
