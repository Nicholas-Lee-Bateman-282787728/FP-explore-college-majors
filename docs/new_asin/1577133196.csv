196076,4,1577133196,"There are many actors who've played Zorro on the screen, but few that I would say really bring the character to life on the screen, and these include Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Tyrone Power, Guy Williams (of the Disney TV series), Reed Hadley (of the Republic serial ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION), Duncan Regehr (of the Family Channel TV series), and Alain Delon.  This film, shot in Italy/France, takes the origin of Zorro in a new direction, transferring the origin from Los Angeles California to Nuova Aragon in South America and giving a less altruistic reason for creating the identity of Zorro (the murder of Zorro's friend, the new Governor of Nuova Aragon, by the evil Colonel Huerta) among other differences, but the plot flows well enough, the humor of Zorro's outfoxing Hueta and his men has been restored, and the final duel between Zorro and Huerta (probably the longest on record) is excellently choreographed.  Although some scenes have been edited to make this film more PG tha! n PG-13 (trimming away some of the more graphic violence), it is still one of the best ZORRO films made and should be considered wrth being a part of any ZORRO film collection.

Alain Delon, even with his chisilled looks as the protaganist, seems more like he should be the Commedante, then Zorro. He acts like a patsy in his alter-ego,  rather than a man that was an intellectual, and someone that was in control of his emotions. This Zorro, did't act like he could control himself when things got close boiling point. The fencng scenes were put together rather well though.  END",898732800,,529,4.666666666666667

I really thought I would never find it. Thankfully I checked again. I was a little hesitant to order, but I'm so glad I did.

196090,5,1577133196,"The Somerville House edition of this film, with a listed publication date of November 19, 2012, is the first complete version of this film I have ever seen. The version that ran on American TV in the late 70s and early 80s included most of the footage you get here, but all prior DVD releases that I'm aware of badly butchered the story, removing as much as a half hour of film. If, like me, you've been waiting your entire adult life for an unedited version of this movie, this edition is the one to get.

Alain Delon is fantastic as Zorro, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and in this version you get to see Zorro redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor in a couple of scenes I've never seen anywhere else. Funny that this particular aspect of the film was one that was consistently cut -- the scene in the church during which Zorro relieves the wealthy of their jewels is enormously entertaining and short enough that it could have been left in without adding much at all to the running time.

The real jewel of the film is its last ten minutes. This is the best swordfight I've ever seen. Zorro and the evil Colonel Huerta fight their way from the ground floor of a building all the way up to the top of a tower. During the course of the fight, both combatants find themselves disarmed at one point or another, a sword is broken, a spear, an axe, and torches are used as weapons, Zorro loses his footing and takes a potentially fatal fall, and you can tell that the adversaries are getting tired (as one would). The use of stunt men must have been minimal, because for most of the fight you can clearly see the actors' faces. This goes for all the other action scenes, as well. The fight in the marketplace is another gem, as is Zorro's rescue of his romantic interest from her prison cell.

If you've never seen this movie, it's an incredible amount of fun and you should watch it immediately. If you have seen it before and would like to fill in those missing gaps and enjoy watching the entire final swordfight, get the Somerville DVD before it disappears.",1458432000,,2083,4.419270833333333

196093,5,1577133196,"Presented in the style of a ""Spaghetti Western"", this Italian/French film version of ""Zorro"" is quite enjoyable. It contains just the right amount of action, adventure, romance and a little bit of comedy.
Alain Delon gives an impeccable performance portraying the characters of Diego de la Vega and Zorro. The final duel (an extended sword fight) is worth the price of admission alone. Mr. Delon and Stanley Baker are convincing combatants as Zorro and Colonel Huerta, respectively. Their epic battle compares with many cinematic duels, including those with lightsabers.
Hats off to Sommerville House for restoring this full 118 minute English version and re-releasing it on blu-ray DVD. I have copies of this movie on VHS and standard DVD that are terribly edited, with many key scenes that were omitted. It is very much appreciated to see this original unedited film, digitally restored.

196101,3,1577133196,"Blu ray transfer is very poor and there are no subtitles. I had not seen this movie previously so I am not able to make comparisons to earlier editions and formats, VHS or DVD. I can only compare it to hundreds of other Blu ray titles I own from different places in film history and all I can say is that the Blu ray transfer on this Zorro is not good at all. Video is very grainy, you can hardly see any details. There is no crisp clear image you expect from a Blu ray format. There is hiss on the audio track. They probably didn't use the original master film for the Blu ray transfer and they did not clean up the video or audio. The scenes in the dark (and there is a segment in the movie where most of the scenes are dark), the contrast is so bad you can hardly see the images. They did not even bother to add subtitles. In the special features (which is not much), there is a part about the restoration of the film with before and after footage and quite frankly I couldn't tel the difference and it doesn't eliminate the concerns over the video or audio quality. Aside from the video/audio quality, it is a good movie. I liked Alain Delon as Zorro, I think he did a great job. I especially enjoyed him playing two different characters that were complete opposites; he was hilarious as the governor and added a nice comedic touch to the otherwise average plot. Action scenes were very decent and nicely done. I especially liked the final confrontation duel at the end between Zorro and the bad guy. Even though it was long, it didn't feel contrived, it was a natural fight scene. I did not care for the soundtrack song ""la la la la Zorro is back"", I thought it sounded like a cheesy pop song and did not convey the atmosphere of the scenes where it played (or I need to watch it a few more times get accustomed to it). There was another musical theme which was more suspenseful, personally I liked that better.",1430697600,,1916,4.2809917355371905
196102,4,1577133196,"LOVED IT!!! This is a great movie if you are any kind of fan of Zorro. The only thing that got on my nerves a little bit was the same song was played over and over and over, but it was still a fun movie.",1429660800,,203,3.533333333333333
196103,5,1577133196,"Alain Delon is my favorite Zorro followed closely by Duncan Regehr. Delon is handsome, elegant, charming, witty and humorous as he battles the evil Colonel Huerta played by Stanley Baker. I had taped this movie once on VHS but wore it to pieces so was very glad to find this DVD to replace it.",1429315200,,293,4.444444444444445
196104,4,1577133196,"For kids it might look a little bit childish. It is the colorized version of an older black and white series and the definition of the image is rather poor. It has not been remastered at that level so at times the picture is blurred and it was shot in such conditions so that cast panoramic views are not very good except if it is to show an empty landscape and fast movements always seem to be magical, some kind of sliding or slipping on the screen.

But it is fine for close-up shots and narrow scenes like a room or a yard.

The story is of course simple, very simple, though there is some truth behind it when California was coveted and lusted after by so many people like the Russians and the Americans. But the plot is really simple-minded with one man and a bunch of gunslingers who try to capture California by capturing Los Angeles which is at the time a pueblo with maybe a couple of hundred inhabitants, most of them Indians. But luckily the one-man show of and the single-handed treatment of problems by Zorro will manage to get all the culprits killed or imprisoned.

Now if you are nostalgic about the character you will like him very much. He is up to his reputation and very swift and smart and his deaf and dumb servant is even better. The sergeant is enormously sympathetic, wine swift and food clever. The rest of the time he is sleeping or doing little though he knows he will get the credit for a lot since Zorro being an outlaw he cannot claim credit for what he does.

I find it yet maybe too colorful to really make me nostalgic of the original in black and white. In fact it has become very funny and it made me laugh a lot, especially with the great number of flower pots and other pottery artifacts that end up on the heads of some bandits or disruptive individuals. After all the bragging that is behind this tale is probably typically Californian since we know California has the best soil in the world and produces the biggest tomatoes in the whole universe.

196114,4,1577133196,"I was drawn to this Zorro film by the rave-reviews that others have posted at Amazon.  I wasn't exactly disappointed, but I did find that Alain Delon's ""Zorro"" isn't without some serious flaws.

The good:
* This is a different (set in South America) take on Zorro, but it's fresh and fun, with lots of humor and action
* Alain Delon makes a great Zorro / fop -- handsome and dashing as the former and very funny as the latter
* Stanley Baker knows how to play a villain to boo and hiss at
* The final duel (about 9-minutes long, not 20 as some have written) is well-choreographed and exciting

The bad:
* At two-hours, the film is much too long.  I've made a copy with Corel Movie Studio that excises almost a half-hour of unnecessary or redundant scenes (lots of running about and such).  The movie suffers from bad editing.
* The friar is a tedious, scolding blowhard who seems like he's drunk all the time.

The ugly:
* The title song ""Zorro is Back"" by G. and M. de Angelis and Dandylion (!), and sung by Oliver Onions (!!), is pretty terrible (though the middle eight section is okay).  Worse still, it's an earworm that will plague you long after hearing it just once.  Even worse yet, it recurs throughout the film four or five times (!!!).  This song alone makes editing necessary.

In summary: I highly recommend this film if you love Zorro stories, Alain Delon, or swashbucklers in general, but only if you have the means to edit it (with a video stabilizer like Dimax's that circumvents copy-protection, and a video editing program).  Under U.S. law you are permitted to make a personal back-up copy, by the way.  If you aren't able to edit it then caveat emptor.",1414022400,,1674,4.488448844884489

196119,5,1577133196,"(This is a review of the latest DVD version of Alain Delon's ""Zorro""  --  the one with him charging on his horse against a red background.)

Splendid outing for Zorro and Delon  --  a sort of nominal ""spaghetti swasher"" that is a high-energy celebration of many, many things: the legend itself, of course, and of life, love, honor, humor, and film-making as well (among other things).

This is the freewheeling style of movie-magic the 60's tried and so often failed to fully realize; no excess baggage here, just pure fun  --  there are moments when the throw-off-your-shackles ""theme"" is gravely stated, but these are always tucked between comedic parentheses and quickly become part of the high-wire, high-octane fun ... and that, for me, is the real theme of the picture. Zorro, whether played by Ty Power or Guy Williams or your own personal favorite, has always been a pretty subversive character, and never more-so than in Delon's almost anarchic version; but if you ain't havin' a blast you ain't subvertin' just exactly right ...

The cast is uniformly terrific and totally dedicated to creating the explosion director Duccio Tessari was obviously intending. Delon, as has been said elsewhere, was born to play the role  --  by '75 the unbelievably pretty boy of his noir days has added a good dose of character to that face, and the cold blue eyes can now show real (occasional) warmth. Stanley Baker is an omnivorous tower of nemesis, enjoying every rotten turn his character takes. The old ""Bernardo"" part done so well by Gene Shelton for Disney is here called ""Joaquin"", and given a fresh reading by Enzo Cerusico of American TV ""My Friend Tony"" reknown; Henry Calvin's ""Garcia"" turn is lovingly recreated in some detail by the equally-loveable French actor Moustache (""Irma la Douce"", ""How To Steal A Million"").

Love interest Ottavia Piccolo may not be the Linda Darnell of the Tyrone Power classic (who is?), but smolders for Zorro even more effectively than Patrice Martinez did for Duncan Regehr in the 90's TV show  --  she is positively, uh ... moist in her scenes with Delon.

The film in this package runs 118 minutes (apparently Piccolo's summing-up speech following The Big Sword-fight has been cut) but plays much shorter. The action and character-development are non-stop; the energy never flags; the choreography is light-footed, light-hearted, and thoroughly astonishing (Delon in his swirling cape running  --  dancing, almost  --  towards you and then turning a corner and dancing away, is just one tiny, quick example); the story is compelling; and underlying all of it is that unmistakeable air of freedom the much-maligned theme song (I love it) sings of.

You can talk about freedom, or you can show it: Delon's ""Zorro"" is a complete illustration.",1405123200,,2781,4.991323210412148

I've since always liked Zorro and his exploits, watching as much of him as I can get hold of. To me, Zorro is even better than 007 James Bond! This 1975 release is the defining film adaption of the Mexican 'Robin Hood'. The French actor is handsome and exudes manhood, and Baker's antagonist is done superbly -- for a while I was always weary of mustached men since they all tended to look like Huerta!

It is a sleeper but I consider it to be one of the best ""Zorro"" movies out there equally as good as ""The Mark of Zorro"" with Tyrone Power, howver this updated version with Alain Delon is much better.

196141,5,1577133196,"I have been searching for this virtually uncut version of Zorro since I first watched it about twenty five years ago. Since then, I found copies of this movie with extensive amounts of material edited out and that really ruined the film. In the meantime there were other Zorro movies made but these focused on the ""star"" rather than the story and, even though I enjoy Zorro movies since I was a kid, they just didn't have the overall appeal of this one. Zorro movies can be ""same, same"" as they say but this one is different. In addition to the ""typical"" Zorro material, there is a subplot that provides witty comic relief through the film as the German guard bumbles his way through his role as a guard and his outrageous love affair.  There is enough going on outside of the typical Zorro plot that makes this version just fun to watch. As I've said, I've watched many Zorro movies but this is the only one that I have watched more than once. It has all the Zorro stuff but is also light and entertaining. If you have an evening where you just want to eat some popcorn and be entertained, this movie is a great choice. The only negative thing I can say about it is that there are about three to five minutes edited out at the very end between the final and defining sword fight on the tower between Zorro and Colonel Huerta (where the Colonel is killed) and then Zorro suddenly appearing out of nowhere on his horse as a grand finale. However, those minutes amount to a monologue delivered by Hortensia to the people to stand up for themselves against the corruption that had become endemic in the provence when Colonel Huerta was in charge. The few minutes of edited material really doesn't affect the movie however, it provides closure for one of the themes running through the movie. It should have been left in. Regardless, this is the best Zorro movie out there.",1368230400,,1869,4.497058823529412

196143,4,1577133196,"Nice to finally have this in decent print format-- long in the public domain it's been released by a lot of fly by night outfits with some murky film quality-- this one (which comes in a red box with Zorro riding Tornado towards us--- I say this because Amazon has a strange habit of mixing up reviews when an item has multiple releases) is not digitally remastered by any stretch of the imagination, but it's at least a decent print.

It doesn't seem to be letterboxed either, although it fit in my widescreen TV-- there were just no bars, and it didn't seem pan and scanned so that's always a plus in my book.

Alain Delon makes a terrific foppish Diego and a even more impressive Zorro.  The story, as with many MANY adaptions of the character takes great liberties from the original but the film makers definitely took a page out of Douglas Fairbanks version and tried to fill it with some really impressive stunts.  There is a great prolonged fight scene in the village done in one take as the camera follows Zorro fighting off the evil soldiers of the corrupt government.

It's a really fun all ages romp which can be watched by all ages, and in this day when a ""hero"" often crosses the line, its nice to find one with some good old fashioned values.

Don't let the song bother you, you'll know all the verses by the end of the film and take it for the spirit it was meant-- FUN.",1361404800,,1385,4.36964980544747

A family friendly feature that entertains from opening shot to the final fencing showdown (the longest ever done I believe).  Delon creates a Zorro that appeals to the child and has enough winks for the adult viewer as well.  The production is marvelously staged and shot at a breathtaking speed by Duccio Tessari.  Everybody knows the story but nobody's seen it done so well since Tyrone Power himself.  I saw nothing wrong with the transfer and it looks and sounds good.

Unlike in many other action movies, the hero often win the fight too easily. Here the fight between our hero and the evil colonel is so fierce and unpredictable, until the last moment, Zorro's victory is far from guaranteed. Quite unusual for showing a battle between the hero and the bad guy, the bad guy here seems to have more power and stamina than our hero, Zorro struggled all the way through the duel and at various moments actually could be vanquished by Huerta. It is refreshing to see being good does not equal to being strong, Zorro has to gather all his strength, courage and wisdom, fight to the last breath and finally win the battle. The fight is so real, so grueling, you could be in shock to see Zorro suffer so much throughout the duel, including the spectacular tumble through a stain glass window. Comparing to CGI-generated action scene in contemporary movies, the sword play here is much more alive and captivating. As the action scenes are so vivid and comprehensible, you almost feel you are experiencing our hero's agony, pain, perseverance and ultimate triumph by yourself all along the battle, it is a truly rewarding experience.

It's missing one final bit of footage in which the young Polito girl delivers some kinda moral boosting speech to the crowd just after Zorro has defeated the tyrant colonel. If you've ever seen the many truncated versions that are everywhere you may have wondered how Zorro gets from the top of the building to be seen by the crowds on his rearing horse at the end of the film so FAST. Well, it's not so fast when the gal delivers her speech to the crowd. How do I know this scene exists? I have a wide screen version in FRENCH that came from ASIA some years ago, and since I don't know French I can't tell you exactly what she is saying to the crowd, but it does give Zorro some time to get to his horse and to make his final dramatic rearing stead exit. Small complaint I know...but I sure wish this release was 100% complete. However, don't let me talk you out of purchasing this new Blu Ray version. It's fantastic, as far as I'm concerned. It's a fabulous price and unless miracles have not been outlawed, this is probably your only way of seeing this film almost completely uncut/unedited. The makers of the MASK OF ZORRO really were influenced by this mid 1970s film. Delon's ZORRO is a marvelous adventure film and Delon made it as a result of being asked by his young son about why his father never made any films that kids could enjoy. Young and old alike are grateful to his son. This film is a super addition to the ZORRO canon. Get it, you'll like it!",1358380800,7,1639,4.342019543973941

Before I get started I want to point out the 124 minutes listed is incorrect. It's only 87 minutes. Now it's really hard to assess an actor's performance when a movie is dubbed, but it seems Alain Delon does a servicable job as both Don Diego and Zorro. But he's noooooooo Duncan Regehr the greatest Zorro ever. (Yes I had to throw that in there) The movie does seem like it had either a big budget or just a whole lot of people that wanted to participate in a movie for free giving it a big budget look and the presentation looks epic scale. At least for post 1950s and 60s biblical epics and pre mid 70s Superman and Star Wars giant budget movies. This movie seems to have a lot more going for it than against it, but if that picture quality is so hard on the eyes, and hard it is. I see no reason to complain about the missing 37 minutes. Until the picture is cleaned up the short version is fine with me. Oh, did mention Alain Delon is noooooooo Duncan Regehr the greatest Zorro ever? Yes I did, but since we're on the subject I may as well tell you. Alain Delon is noooooooo Duncan Regehr the greatest Zorro ever.",1314403200,,1273,4.157894736842105
196161,1,1577133196,"WARNING! WARNING! DANGER!!!  Please note that this is NOT the full length original version of the film.  Over 30 minutes of the movie has been edited out.  Many major scenes are missing completely.  For example the first 5 or 10 minutes of the movie is not there.. the DVD starts with the murder.. no lead in whatsoever.  The film cuts directly from the discovery of the secret passage (revealed by the dog Assasin) to the scene with the monk on trial.  You miss the whole sequence with the Don and his sidekick asking questions in the street, witnessing the Monk speaking out and getting chased off, the kid (chico) setting animals free and leaving the mark of zorro, and ultimately telling the Don about Zorro.  All that is missing.

Next thing I noticed was the attempt on the Don's life (poisoned food killing the pigeons, Assasin the dog saving him) was cut out as well as the Aunt riding off in the coach with all her jewels, getting attacked by ""bandits"" who were actually soldiers.  All this cutting makes a lot of the movie make no sense.  Apparently they just decided to cut everything but the action sequences... maybe hoping to make the film appeal to children... silly because those who are most likely to purchase this will be doing so out of nostalgia and be very disappointed when they find 25% of the movie is missing!

Also the picture quality is rather poor.  It isn't terrible but it looks like a direct recording of an aged film reel.

Hope this helps!  I found that if you go to amazon.fr you can find the full version.

196170,3,1577133196,"Zorro is no masterpiece but it does have a few good things going for it. First and foremost is Alain Delon who is always a suave guy to watch. He plays Zorro as a man with a mission. His  mission is to restore law and order to a peasant village that corrupt officials and a violent general named Huerta have seen fit to terrorize. Zorro's brother was about to become the governor who promised to bring change to the village but Huerta had him executed days before he was  to take power. So Zorro goes using his brother's identity and carries out his plan. This distresses Huerta a great deal and he plots the execution of this impostor. Delon's scenes as the politician are hilarious as he plays him very fey and easily excitable. Once Delon puts on the mask  it's a different story. He begins protecting the villagers and attacking the corrupt government. There are a lot of good sword fights and action scenes in this one. The adventure doesn't always get you over the boring spots that pop up but the exciting De Angelis Bro score makes things a little more exciting. The theme song ""Here's to Being Free (Zorro's Back)"" may sound familiar. That's because director Wes Anderson dropped the Zorro's back chorus and used the song in his debut film Bottle Rocket. The song starts blasting whenever Delon starts slashing away with his sword which is to say frequently. The two combine to make this an enjoyable adventure to pass the time with.",1219881600,,1442,4.603112840466926

The transfer to DVD seemed to have been made from a poor theater print, with lines and color dropout all through the video.  The film itself is fun, and Delon makes one forget Tyrone Power, since he is so much the better (and better-looking!) actor.

The adventurer and brilliant swordsman Diego journeys to Nueva Aragon to pose as his murdered friend, who had been slated as the new governor of that corrupt pueblo. Diego has vowed to live up to his friend's ideals but promptly realizes that martial measures might at times be called for. Accordingly, in Nueva Aragon, Diego adopts foppish mannerisms to fool the evil Colonel Huerta and to camouflage his other identity - that of the rabble's fabled hero and avenger Zorro. As the masked and cloaked people's bandit, Diego does his best to bring justice to a beleaguered province...and does his best also to spark a gleam in the eyes of an outspoken aristocratic senorita.

I know of two versions of this 1975 film. There is the 2 hour film and there's the truncated and awfully edited copy, which is an hour and a half long and is absent of key explanatory scenes (Diego's friendship with Miguel de la Serna, Nueva Aragon's new Governor; how Diego learns of Zorro). If you've seen the 2 hour film, then the story makes sense and the movie experience is a fun one. If you have the other version...well, I share your pain. Somewhere, sometime in the past, I've managed to watch the film as it was meant to be seen. I don't know why this film was cut short of half an hour, other than to be able to show it on TV in a 2 hour window with commercials. But then why release this crap version on dvd?

Charismatic French actor and then sex symbol Alain Delon (LE SAMOURAI, ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS - both classic films) plays Zorro with virility and dash. As the Fox he is clever, nimble, and often cockily grinning. He athletically leaps and swings about. And with his commanding voice he pulls off the hero role quite well. As the governor, he's also effective, perfectly playing the simpering and quite cowardly fellow. Delon is very good.

This story wasn't meant to be exactly faithful to Johnston McCulley's book THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO, which debuted Zorro. When this Diego arrives as the new governor, Zorro is already an established legend, an identity of which Diego readily makes use. The venue is also moved to the corrupt town of Nueva Aragon. Oh, and Zorro gets a dog in this one. Plenty of rollicking action escapades here, as Zorro mocks and abuses a host of bumbling soldiers. The film culminates with Zorro's sprawling, extended sword fight with his nemesis, the wicked Colonel Huerta (a solid Stanley Baker).

And the song? Yep, the happy-go-lucky theme song initially tormented me, but oddly enough I grew to like it. Whenever ""Zorro's Back"" was played it usually served to showcase an action sequence, but, in a way, it also serves to punctuate what Zorro stands for. It's also disturbingly easy to sing along to.

There's an awful, most unconvincing stunt sequence of a carriage crashing over a cliff, and Diego's mute servant turned out to be very annoying. But, minus those objections (oh, and the clipped 30 minutes, of course), I've really got no complaints. This one's pretty darn good.",1191110400,2,3081,4.717472118959108

This is five stars and all the others (except the very first one from ~1920) are 1 star or less.  Delon is handsome and masculine yet not overly so, and his Zorro has lots of macho as well as humor, very much like the 007 portrayed by Roger Moore.  This is the Zorro most people will like, as there's no pretense or unnecessary roughness.  The DVD's quality is not great, but I still give this five stars because Delon's screen presence in this film is just superb.",1135900800,2,559,4.295238095238095
196182,2,1577133196,"I've read a few of the recent reviews on this site and I must disagree with them.  This is not a great movie.  It's hard for me to believe that someone thinks so.

There is nothing the least bit realistic going on.  There are no characters and no parts of the plot that can be believed.

When I was a child I enjoyed watching Zorro on tv.  This movie can be enjoyed by an eight year old.  Perhaps it can also be enjoyed by an adult who reveres it because he liked the Zorro character from childhood.  But if you come to it with fresh eyes, not giving it an automatic pass because you used to like Zorro shows, it no longer gets a free pass.

If we are meant to buy one minute of it, then why did the heroine of the film consent to marry the villain?  Give me a break.  Are you telling me that evil triumphed so completely, for a moment, that the rebellious, courageous woman agreed to marry the one man she hated, in order to save the lives of her parents?  That's pretty awful.  Why not just leave?

The fact that this woman is treated so unrealistically in the film shows how juvenile the film is.  A little boy wouldn't get that involved in what happens to a grownup lady, would he.  Who cares.  The target audience for this film is a little boy.

The movie deals with a very serious issue, the exploitation of the poor by the powerful.  But it deals with it in a childish and simplistic way.

This is a movie for little kids.  The refrain, the song we keep hearing throughout, ""here's to being free, lalalalalala, Zorro's back"" sums it up.  We get to pretend that the truly evil people in this world can be danced around, with a light heart.

I don't think this film is worth the few bucks it costs, unless you are such a fan of old Zorro movies that you won't even mind this one.",1120867200,,1784,4.167155425219941

196184,4,1577133196,"All of us probably have the greatest affinity for the first characterization we saw of our favorite heroes, whether it is Superman, Sherlock Holmes, or Zorro. Alain Delon was the first Zorro I saw, so all others fall WAY short in my opinion. Saw this movie on TV as a kid in 1976 and became obsessed with Zorro for a long time. Years later, when I saw it on Amazon on VHS I bought it immediately with a shout of glee!

The movie itself has a certain rough-cut, but magical charm. Dont expect a well polished, big budget film. This is a spagetti-western (low budget, made in Italy), with the same gritty feel as Clint Eastwood's ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."" The theme/score is a folksy, uplifting song that you will never forget- because it seems to be the only song they play, except for the villian music/dirge. SOme don't like it; I think it adds to the charm of the film.

Great family movie! I watched it with my kids and they laughed for days at the mild camp and gag-lines! Lots of good clean humor, great sets and costumes, and some of the BEST SWORDFIGHTING on film. No love scenes...just love interest/romance. Three on-screen deaths but no blood or gore. NO PROFANITY! What a novel idea...!

The story departs artistically from the typical Don Diego in California. In this version, Diego clandestinely assumes the identity of his assassinated friend, the incoming Governor of Nuevo Aragon(?) which is either a fictitious province of early 19th century Mexico or South America. He cleverly deals with the villian (and heroine) in both roles, as a wimpy, weak ruler and also as the daring masked rider. Children cheer as he appears, dealing out justice to corrupt officials and leaving his trademark ""Z"" majestically with a whip or sword. The film suggests that ""Zorro is back"", and hints that perhaps a previous governor was an earlier Zorro some years ago, and the downtrodden villagers are jubilant to see Zorro return.

All of Zorro's appearances are spectacular, and his escapes are humorous and amazing, from bouncing on multiple awnings onto his horse, to rolling down a ramp in a wine barrel toppling soldiers on his way. Unmatched stunts and swordplay.

Quirky and fun. A must see for true Zorro fans. Just realize going in that your favorite Zorro will probably always be the one you saw first. Alain Delon is still my favorite.",1101945600,16,2351,4.7104622871046224

196189,5,1577133196,"Miguel Vega de la Suerta has been appointed the new governor of Nuova Aragon in the New World. Shortly before he leaves Barcelona, he is assassinated by men who do not wish for him to reach Nuova Aragon. His friend Diego is present when Suerta is shot. Just before Suerta dies, Diego vows to travel to Nuova Aragon as the new governor and avenge his friend. Sureta makes Diego promise to not shed any blood or else not make the trip. Against his better judgement, Diego promises.

 In Nuova Aragon, Colonel Huerta asks the council for complete control of the army and government so that he can reestablish law and order in the territory. Diego appears at the meeting as the new governor, Suerta. Diego speaks in an effeminate manner an claims to be quite shaken by how bad the situation is in Nuova Aragon.

 Diego and his mute servant, Joaquin, watch Colonel Huerta force his men through a grueling practice which results in several of the men being injured. At the conclusion of the practice, Huerta slices the candles in the candelabra expertly. Diego asks Huerta for protection, and Huerta assigns Garcia, a bumbling soldier with a great appetite. Diego returns to the governor's quarters. Right after Diego says something about needing to find a way out of his quarters, a dog shows him a secret passage.

 In the plaza, Brother Francisco is charged with selling worthless hides and is sentenced to 20 lashes. As Brother Francisco is lashed, Zorro appears and lashes the soldiers. Zorro forces the soldiers to release Brother Francisco and then forces the soldiers to lash the men who were responsible for Brother Francisco's unfair prosecution.

 Diego sees a portrait of Hortensia Pulido and is attracted to her. He is told that her family was once wealthy and is now poor. Later, Hortensia urges the people to rise up against the soldiers. She tells them that the scales are rigged and that the soldiers are cheating them. Zorro appears and ridicules Garcia. After toying with Garcia for some time, Zorro makes his escape, aided with the help of a young boy. Hortensia watches Zorro's actions with admiration. Afterwards, Zorro visits Hortensia, displaying more than a casual interest in her. The soldiers approach and Hortensia urges Zorro to run. She states that she is very worried about him.

 Colonel Huerta arrives at Hortensia's home and orders his men to search the premises. Huerta proceeds to make unwanted advances upon Hortensia. He offers to marry her and tells her that it will redeem her entire family. When Huerta adds that it might even prove to be a pleasurable experience for her, Hortensia slaps him. Huerta grabs Hortensia and kisses her forcefully. Zorro emerges from the garden, disarms Huerta, and forces Huerta to go down on his knees and ask Hortensia for her forgiveness. Hortensia and Zorro walk outside as Huerta is leaving. Hortensia tells Zorro that she is still frightened for him and wonders how she can help him. Zorro kisses her hand. Hortensia kisses Zorro's cheek, and Zorro leaves.

  Diego, still in his assumed role as the governor, presides over a dinner party. His dog arrives with a note signed by Zorro that threatens the governor's life. Diego pretends to be terrified that Zorro is after him.

 Colonel Huerta visits Diego and tells him that he has devised the perfect plan to capture Zorro. Huerta plans to imprison Hortensia and cart her around the plaza until Zorro rescues her. Soldiers will be hidden everywhere so that there will be no possible way Zorro can escape. Zorro instructs Hortensia to go to the mission to hide. As Zorro makes his escape, he overhears Colonel Huerta saying that the governor was the only other person who knew of the plan. Huerta hurries to the governor's bedroom, but Diego beats him there by just a few moments. As Diego and Huerta converse briefly about the failed plan, it is clear that Huerta is suspicious of Diego. Diego suddenly insists that he himself serve as bait for Zorro, since he is the one Zorro wishes to kill.

 Continuing his masquerade as the governor, Diego goes on a fishing trip wit Garcia. While Diego and Garcia fish, Joaquin appears as Zorro. Joaquin is chased by the soldiers and seeks refuge in the same mission where Hortensia is hiding. The children of the mission help by disguising themselves as Zorro and making several apperances that keep the soldiers chasing along false trails. Diego pretends to be going to the carriage to sleep but instead makes an appearance as Zorro. Zorro then enters the carriage and pretends to have the governor at gunpoint. By using the governor as a hostage, Zorro is able to get the soldiers to release some people who have been forced into labor. Zorro flees in the carriage, hotly pursued by the soldiers. Zorro drives the carriage off a cliff into the water, and it appears that both Zorro and the governor are dead.

 Huerta plans to marry Hortensia now that both Zorro and the governor are dead. Just as Hortensia arrives for the wedding, Brother Francisco appears with the freed workers, demanding justice. Zorro arrives and tells Huerta that he as a rebellion on his hands. Huerta shoots and kills Brother Francisco, which causes the people to revolt. Zorro comments that the murder of Brother Francisco releases him from the promise he made a friend. Zorro and Huerta begin a very long duel. At one point during the fight, Huerta believes that he has killed Zorro only to discover that Zorro has survived. Finally, Huerta and Zorro end up on the roof, and Huerta says that one of them must die. Zorro says that it shall now be the moment of truth and removes his mask. Zorro runs Huerta through with his sword, and Huerta falls from the roof of the building. The movie ends with Zorro riding off on his horse into the distance.",1032912000,,5788,4.787362086258776

There is very little clear connection between scenes, and it is sometimes extremely difficult to follow who all the characters are, or where the action takes place.  There is no background music except for the occasional recurrance of the tacky theme song (""...la la la la, Zorro's back"") and the final fight scene goes on forever with nothing but the clang of swords.

7798961,4,1577133196,"RELEASED IN 1975 and directed by Duccio Tessari, Zorro stars Alain Delon as a new Spanish governor in Mexican California in the 1820s. With the populace of Nueva Aragn under the oppressive rule of corrupt Colonel Huerta (Stanley Baker), the foppish governor becomes the masked adventurer, Zorro, to bring justice. Ottavia Piccolo plays the noble hottie; Enzo Cerusico Zorros mute servant; and Moustache a bumbling fat bastage soldier.

The version I viewed cut out an entire half hour, so I might raise my rating if I eventually see the longer version. Nevertheless, theres enough good in the short version to make this colorful European rendition of Zorro worth catching if you like swashbuckling adventure flicks with joie de vivre (joy of living), like The Musketeer (2001), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and, of course, The Mask of Zorro (1998).

Im familiar with protagonist Delon from a couple of his prior films, Texas Across the River (1966) and Red Sun (1971), where he struck me as a striking, charismatic actor; unfortunately, hes not well known in the USA. Regardless, hes just perfect for the role of Zorro. Meanwhile, Piccolo is mind-blowing as the honorable senorita. The closing elongated sword fight is possibly the best bout of fencing put to celluloid, next to the one at the end of Rob Roy (1995).

Delon is excellent as the handsome Zorro complete with vivid blue eyes behind the mask. Great movie and good humor. and Garcia looks amazing like the Garcia we see in the Disney Version. * warning* there are plenty of grain in the movie at the beginning and the end.* but worth a watch due to the plot and over all movie.",1499817600,2,1283,4.297520661157025

7798967,5,1577133196,"Fantastic movie to watch for fun, to distract from the daily problems of life. Alain Delon is so great in this movie, you gotta like him. Funny at times, romantic and with great photographic scenes, this Zorro version doesn't have anything to envy to Hollywood, sincerely.",1475971200,,272,4.934782608695652
7798968,5,1577133196,"This was the Zorro I grew up with and watched over and over again. I found it on dvd about 10 years ago and was horrified that it had been slashed by a full half hour, so I was ecstatic to find it recently on blu ray restored to its full 2 hour glory. And I was equally delighted to discover that I enjoyed it just as much as I had as a kid. Is it cheesy? Yes, yes it is. The theme song has been suggested as useful for criminal interrogations, and you really have to either love it or ignore it. And some of the characters and humor are bit too goofy for me...But Alain Delon is so beautifully perfect as the character, mischievous one minute, ice cold the next, he makes the movie rise above any other Zorro I've ever seen. His horse is incredible and there's also a brilliant Great Dane who becomes an additional sidekick. Stanley Baker in his last film role is pitch perfect as the villainous Colonel Huerta, and the climactic duel is the best I've ever seen. The girl is feisty and lovely, and the movie is squeaky clean. Great for Zorro fans and kids of all ages.",1475280000,,1069,4.194174757281553
