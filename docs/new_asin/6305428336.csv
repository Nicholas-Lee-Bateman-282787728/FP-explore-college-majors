1019347,5,6305428336,"This movie ranks in the top five of positive films about African American families and our lives.  From Alfre Woodard to James Freeman Jr. to Wesley Snipes to Mary Alice to the young and old supporting cast.  This is  real--our struggles, our sacrifices, our love, our strength, the integrity  of our ancestral heritage, our survival in spite of hardships.  Hollywood,  with the help of Black filmmakers and directors had better start producing  more movies like this one, ""Once upon a Time when We Were  Colored"" and ""Eve's Bayou!""

In the beginning of the movie you caught up with the idea of another case where the mother made bad choices and the grandmother is working hard to keep the family strong, but the story is so much more.

1019806,5,6305428336,"I can relate to this film today as much as I did when I first saw it in the theater with my daughter (Christmas 1998). I've had to relocate because of a base closure and also take in family members who had alcohol and drug problems and wanted to change their life.  The movie didn't do good at the box office however, I bought my dvd copy to watch whenever I'm feeling down and need to be lifted. I liked all the characters from Loretta's daughter (Autism) to Aunt Annie (Esther Rolle (Alzheimer). It touched on diseases of the young and old in addition to struggles our families have with alcohol, drugs and unemployment and also companies closings and a recession going on. I liked the soundtrack from the first song by Prince (Don't Talk to Strangers) song by Chaka Khan to the last song (Where Would I Be) song by the Leverts (Eddie,Gerald & Sean). The song by the Leverts had a special meaning because the movie showed how the father Earl (Al Freeman, Jr.) loves his son Will (Wesley Snipes) even though they are in different states and how they come together when times get rough. I wished my sons could have seen this movie with my daughter and I but I let them see the dvd and they loved it. It is truly a movie that the family should see together.

1019911,5,6305428336,"This film is both heartfelt and funny. Maya Angelou had directed the movie in a straight forward style (no need for camera tricks or flashy embellishments here) and as such delivers a film that builds to an emotional, satisfying ending that should please all. All the acting is first-rate with an especially great performance by Alfre Woodard.  The screenplay provides for a wonderful family story to unfold at just the right pace with some pleasant surprises along the way.  And, although this is a story about a Black family, any person of any race will be able to identify with the characters and share in this heart-warming experience.

1019912,5,6305428336,"I think this film should be required viewing in every school across our nation.  Without realizing it, the viewer is slowing given a very personal lesson in slavery and its impact on the African American family, both in the past and as it effects these families today.  The film gets its message across without the viewer learning the meaning of the candlestick named ""Nathan,"" but when a family's determination to not allow a pawnbroker to take possession of Nathan is finally revealed, the impact slavery and how its horror echoes through to the present day becomes clear without being preachy or over-dramatic.

The performances of all the actors are exemplary, especially Miss Woodard.  It is a film that helps all people, black and white alike, more clearly define race in our country today and how the wounds of the past continue to scar us today, with a message of hope and power for the future.",1163030400,2,902,4.8

1019915,4,6305428336,"""Down in the Delta,"" directed by Maya Angelou, tells the story of Loretta (played by Alfre Woodard), a single mother who lives in Chicago and faces economic hardships. She and her kids move to the family's rural ancestral home to live with her uncle (Al Freeman, Jr.). This change of setting has a profound impact on the family.
Those familiar with Angelou's fine books will probably see similar themes explored in this film. Solid performances are turned in by the excellent ensemble cast. I was especially impressed by Mpho Koaho as Loretta's young son. And veteran performer Esther Rolle turns in particularly moving performance as Loretta's Alzheimer's-afflicted aunt.
This film does a good job of exploring a variety of interconnected relationships in this multigenerational context. The film celebrates family ties and family tradition, as well as one's capacity to overcome adversity.",1048982400,11,891,5.326241134751773
1019916,5,6305428336,This is the type of movie that causes you to stop and think. It shows some of the extremes you go through to keep family together.

1019917,5,6305428336,"This was a phenomenal movie.  This is one of the only movies I have seen where African-American families are portrayed in a positive, and yet not politically manipulative light.  The messages delivered through this production are as timeless as the meaning behind ""Nathan"" (a centerpiece in the movie). I would highly recommend this for teachers to use for powerful examples of ethnic identity development, positive examples of multicultural awareness, and inspirational teachings for all students.  Additionally, this is a great show for families to feel comfortable watching together (however, there may be one or two scenes that are a little harsh for children- but they are not graphic by any means).
Overall, this is an excellent film!!",1025049600,5,741,5.316239316239316
1019918,5,6305428336,"I haven't felt this good about a movie in a long time.  Not since  ""A Trip to Bountiful"" anyway.  I don't know how I missed it on the big screen.  Thank god for DVD.  (Too bad Bountiful is not out on DVD yet. )
It is a beautifully-made family movie without sex, violence and foul language (or even harsh language for that matter).  If you want any of that or fast-paced action (Wesley Snipes in not cast in his usual role) you will not get it here. In fact, I don't know why it wasn't rated G.
I won't bother to repeat the story since it has been covered by other reviewers here.  Maya Angelou has made a slow-paced but even-tempoed film that chronicles a family's struggle to stay together.  In her subtle way she almost succeeds in making us fail to notice that this is an African-American film with barely a white face seen except in flash-back sequences.  Her subtlety also extends to portraying strength in her female characters even when they are flawed.  It is enlightening to watch how she blends societal contrasts so effortlessly - the contrast between the haves and the have-nots and the one between urban and rural America.
All in all, this is a good movie to watch with your family.",1023580800,7,1195,4.465437788018433
1019919,4,6305428336,"In recent years, the number of movies and TV shows about African-Americans and other minority groups has declined. I am simply stating a fact, for I have no idea why this has happened. Whatever the reasons, I am always overjoyed when a movie like Down in the Delta makes it to the screen.
It is true that Down in the Delta is not a major piece of film making. Director Maya Angelou, who is by profession a famous poet, does not have the experience behind the camera to bring us a polished product. What she does know how to do is to weave a tale quietly and effectively.
This is the story of the Sinclair family and of a candelabra called Nathan. Nathan has been in the family since the end of the Civil War and is now in the possession of Rosa Sinclair [Mary Alice], who long ago moved from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago. She is a middle-aged widow trying to cope with her dysfunctional daughter, Loretta [Alfre Woodard]. Loretta has two children. They all live with Rosa in a small, but well-kept apartment in a rough Chicago neighborhood.
Rosa is a strong woman, and she believes that family nurtures the soul. This may be an old-fashioned notion, but it remains an inspiring one. When Loretta has yet another bout with drugs and alcohol, Rosa asks her brother Earl [Al Freeman, Jr.] if he will take Loretta and the children in for the summer.
Earl still lives in the Delta. Loretta and the kids find themselves in a different world. While it is never stated, it is obvious that director Angelou means for us to understand that the South has undergone changes since the great migrations to Northern urban areas. As cities like Chicago have become increasingly rough, the South has gotten much more livable. The Sinclairs there live in a fine old home in the country outside a small town. Earl has his own restaurant called Just Chicken, because that's all he serves. No one is rich, but everyone works. The town has a sense of community. Loretta's son discovers that school is much more pleasant, but also academically harder. Loretta herslef discovers that people are more willing to help her overcome her lack of work skills.
The Mississippi Sinclairs are not without problems. Earl misses his son, who's a lawyer in Atlanta. His wife Annie [Esther Rolle] has Alzheimer's disease. When Loretta suggests that Annie might be better off in a home, Earl replies that she is home. As the weeks go by, Loretta and her children learn the importance of family, something her mother has been trying to teach her for years.
Throughout the movie there is the story of Nathan - or rather the story of its meaning to the family. The flashbacks are minimal, but in the end this plot device works well in summing up the point of the story.",1016755200,6,2732,4.600409836065574
1020010,4,6305428336,"Maya Angelou's directorial debut underperformed at the box office, but don't let that discourage you from seeing this winner.  It concerns a drug-abusing mother (a great Alfre Woodard) who can't kick her habit or hold down a job.  In other words, this girl's a mess.  In an effort to get her act together, she takes her kids down south to begin a new life.  At times, the movie has a made-for-TV feel, but it's an otherwise riveting debut for Angelou.  You can feel her prescence in her directorial style; the words spoken from a few of the actors have a certain poetic flow.  So, why, then, did I give it a rating of only 4 stars?  Because the DVD has absolutely no features!  No trailer!  No production notes!  Nada!  I hope Miramax will revisit this film and give it a bunch of decent features including a making-of featurette.

1020018,4,6305428336,"Nowadays when I see the words ""family film"", I take it with a grain of salt. Not this time! At last, a film I could sit down and watch with my teenagers and not have to hit stop. An intelligent film with real  people and real situations you could believe and relate to. A film that  emphasizes the importance of family, tradition and unconditional love.  I  look forward to more films from Maya Angelou.",952992000,3,403,4.405405405405405
1020019,5,6305428336,"Finally, a film that the entire family can see that doesn't have any sex scenes that are embarrassing to watch when you're with your children.  (That's where ""Soul Food"" fell short.)  James Freeman Jr. and  Esther Rolle (this was her last film) were superb!  This movie is an unsung  classic that every Black family should own for their collection. Don't  wait, buy it NOW!",952387200,4,373,4.75

7888772,4,6305428336,"This is a good movie from 1998 that I still have on VHS, and Wesley Snipes is one of the main characters in this movie. Out of all the main characters in this movie, Wesley Snipes is my favorite actor. And I also have a favorite action movie on VHS that I like to watch with Wesley Snipes, and that movie is ""Passenger 57"". So before I watch this movie Down In The Delta, I would sometimes watch the movie ""Passenger 57"". And I would also sometimes watch the movie ""Blade"", another movie with Wesley Snipes that came out in the same year as this movie ""Down In The Delta"". Those two other movies with Wesley are totally different, and he does play a good character. And I find that Wesley also
did a good job playing a good character in this movie ""Down In The Delta"". You don't see much of him in this movie, but he's still one of the main characters. And not only do I like Wesley Snipes in this movie, but I also like Alfre Woodard and all the other main characters. And knowing that Wesley Snipes is one of the main characters in this movie, this is the last movie I would watch with him in it. I find him and Alfre Woodard had a great connection in this movie, and they were both nice to each other. So this is a movie I would never want to forget.

I don't too much care for the movies that Wesley came out with after this movie ""Down In The Delta"", so I wouldn't too much get into his movies like that. But he still is my favorite actor. And I would say that I would only watch three movies with Wesley Snipes, this movie ""Down In The Delta"", ""Passenger 57"", and ""Blade"".

Other than that, this movie is also about family getting together and having good times.",1476662400,,1668,4.1770186335403725
