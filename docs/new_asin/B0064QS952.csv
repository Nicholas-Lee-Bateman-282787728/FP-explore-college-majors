4952968,1,B0064QS952,I bought this because it was supposed to be 4 DVDs for $15. I had also previously bought a GAIAM yoga 3 workout set featuring an Asian gentleman whose name escapes me but they were good DVDs. What a joke this set is. The power yoga is ridiculous. There are no instructions as to how to breathe while doing the positions and I've been doing yoga for a couple of years now so I know one of the most important aspects is matching the movement to the breath. NO INSTRUCTION WHATSOEVER. I got so frustrated I finally popped out the DVD and popped in the Relaxation DVD but it was not to be. I literally watched a chick lie on the floor for three minutes before I decided that was enough of that. The toning DVD was completely cheesy and silly with a mariachi band playing in the background. I've decided the only peace and relaxation I'm going to get from this set is by donating it to Goodwill and hoping someone else can get something out of it.,1344902400,4,942,4.268156424581005
4952969,1,B0064QS952,This was a very disappointing DVD set. They're all very outdated--NOT filmed in 2011 like the box wants you to believe. The 'Yoga Tone' isn't Yoga but just a workout Dvd. 'Yoga Sculpt' is ridiculous. I would definitely pass on this.,1337299200,5,232,4.682926829268292
4952970,1,B0064QS952,"So I was in Target's workout section and saw this little number and said to myself, what the heck, why not, it's only $15 so if it's a bust I won't lose too much.

I am so glad I only spent $15. It was a complete bust.

So if one looks at the back of the packaging, it says copyright 2011, so one would think that the videos are current.

WRONG.

The newest ones are from 2002 and there are two from 1990. 1990, people!!! Complete with post-80s puffy hair. Even one video (yoga sculpt) from the 2002 set has a little yoga mariachi band or whatever playing in the background of the set (you can actually see them with their rainsticks or whatever...very distracting). The set for yoga sculpt is also set up really weird, with like everyone in a circle and they look like they're about ready to hit each since they are crammed on there so tight! Not to mention the styling is disguisting and completely laugh-able. Very New Age-y and foo foo (there are Chinese lanterns hanging around and the camera angle from the ceiling shows that the floor is a giant ying-yang symbol)...I guess I'm too used to Jillian Michaels...on a gym set...looking fashionable...and modern.

Not sure if I should keep this to have friends over so we can mute it and do our own overdubs (*host points to pants* overdub: ""Help! Get me a new pair!!! These are olive GREEN!!!"") or if I should throw it away with the rest of society's garbage. Like those olive green pants.",1332806400,7,1442,4.446969696969697
8492785,1,B0064QS952,Soooo disappointing.  This is not yoga.  Especially disappointing coming from Gaiam.,1423267200,,84,6.545454545454546

8492787,4,B0064QS952,"I enjoyed the sculpting ones.  But you do need light weights; haven't gone through them all yet.  I started running a few months ago and I'm overweight so this compliments other stuff I do to lose weight.  I don't care about the decor or the hair of the person doing it so long as it gets me results.  For those looking to learn poses and how to breathe properly,  then don't get this.  One I'd recommend for Learning poses is Yoga Zone Yoga for beginners...although it's an old set the Yogi knows his stuff and takes his time to explain both poses and how to breath and it lasts an hour ending in corpse pose where you float.",1408838400,,626,4.262711864406779
8492788,1,B0064QS952,"I love doing yoga, and was excited to see that at least the Power Yoga portion was Vinyasa yoga.  It was less than wonderful, and I didn't feel much of a burn at all. I tried the Tone disc next and it was awful. I don't do yoga with a drum circle for a reason, and I didn't feel like it was a workout at all. Way too hippy-dippy for my tastes. Glad it was a cheap dvd set at target and that I didn't plunk down any major cash on this. Still looking for a good Vinyasa power yoga dvd!",1403827200,,483,3.782178217821782
8492789,1,B0064QS952,"My son bought this for me for Christmas knowing that I love GAIAM products.
I am appalled by the blatant misrepresentation and false advertising of this product.
I can't believe my grade schooler wasted his allowance money on this rubbish.
Waiting to see if Gaiam will do right by sending out a replacement. I cannot believe they would re-package this
footage to give the impression it was current. The model on the discs and cover are not even in the DVD's,
she probably wasn't even born yet. Gaiam you should be ashamed!",1389052800,,522,4.684782608695652
8492790,1,B0064QS952,"Out of the 4 dvds included in this dvd set I've only gotten any use out of 1 of them: the power yoga dvd. It's not great but it's ok. The toning, sculpting, and relaxing yoga dvds are a joke. They're straight from the 80's so I felt very deceived by the modern looking cover on the dvd set. I wouldn't care about that if they were actually any good though. Yoga tone is not yoga. I'm not sure what it is actually. Yoga sculpt is weird. There some kind of odd band playing on the set. I couldn't even take it seriously. Yoga for relaxation is boring and has 3 poses. Chilling out in corpse pose with some soothing music would be about the same thing. No dvd needed for that.
Long story short? Save your money. This one's a flop.",1363564800,,727,4.126760563380282
8492791,1,B0064QS952,"This DVD is not worth the money.  I was so excited because I didn't have a yoga class when I moved for school and this was on sale. I now know why.  The Power Yoga is good, I really quite like it.  All the other DVDs are crap.  The yoga sculpt has these drums going on and there is nothing to do with yoga besides the mats on the floor. Yoga tone was the same way.  Yoga for relaxation only has a few poses and you have to have a ton of equipment that most don't have. I would just say try a different one.",1361664000,4,506,3.780952380952381
8492792,1,B0064QS952,"I so wish i had checked the reviews on my phone before i purchased at Target. I almost did...
The first dvd is somewhat ok. Three ten minute sessions. Not awful, but not great.
There is no option to fast forward through the instructions each time.
The other videos are from the 80's or 90's and beyond outdated.
I cannot believe Target sells this.
Do not waste your money.",1360108800,,372,4.405797101449275
8492793,1,B0064QS952,"Bought at Target like a couple of other reviewers, and glad I didn't spend much. I'm fairly new to yoga so hoped to get some basics - not with this one. Tried the Power dvd first. No information on the poses themselves or breathing. I had the same problem with a beginner class at a local Y - the instructor didn't teach the poses or breathing, just starting going through the poses and you were I guess supposed to know them and follow along on your own. And also tried the ""relaxation"" one, but it was only a couple of poses that felt like a waste of time. I can do better relaxation with my own combined breathing and stretches. Thinking I'll get a book and learn the basic poses one at a time, then create my own flow routine. Into the Goodwill box this one goes. Don't waste your money.",1359072000,,791,4.245033112582782
8492794,1,B0064QS952,"I was in Target and spontaneously decided to buy this DVD without reading any reviews. Actually, there are no reviews on this DVD on Target.com because it is not on the website at all! The cover looks normal, from this century, and the set includes 4 DVDs for only $15. Also, it is Gaiam and I own and thoroughly enjoy several of Rodney Yee's yoga videos and a Gaiam yoga mat, which is pretty cool too. This DVD however, is the biggest disappointment in terms of workouts, execution, instructions and visuals. I really don't want to insult any of the instructors so I won't refer to specific workouts but one of the ladies never mentions the number of repetitions, she doesn't count and suddenly she informs that this was the last one while your leg is mid-air or something... There's nothing wrong with the 80-90s, but it came as a surprise to see the participants rocking puffy hairdos and all around 90s vibe, when the cover clearly states 2011. Some instructors, which is truly hilarious, use either a very seductive voice and/or powerful eye contact throughout their segments. Lastly, I work out a lot- jogging, P90X, yoga and Pilates, and without being an expert I can still predict that the moves in this DVD won't do much unless someone counts big time laughing as abdominal workout. I really believe that this DVD should be recalled and all of us who purchased it should receive an apology and the newest Rodney Yee dvd for free in act of good will from Gaiam or Target, just a suggestion.",1348272000,7,1498,4.635338345864661
