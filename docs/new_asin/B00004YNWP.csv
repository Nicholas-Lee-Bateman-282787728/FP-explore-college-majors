7927421,1,B00004YNWP,"i never take time to rate things, however, i am taking the time to say this....this video is simply an info-mercial that you buy. as much as i admire laura mercier's work, i just can not believe that this video would be so deceptive. basically, it is an extremely vague promotion of her products. if you want to learn what you would from this video..simply pick up ""allure"" magazine. there is nothing to be gained from buying this video. totally unsatisfied. shame on you, laura mercier.",1106611200,7,487,4.674418604651163
7927422,3,B00004YNWP,"I have to agree with the reviewer who found this video lacking.  If I had realised what it was, only 30 minutes, and none of Laura Mercier's glamour work--but mostly an advertisment for her line of cosmetics--I would not have bought it.  It certainly doesn't seem worth the price--there's lots of filler (short bios of the models, Laura talking about her ""makeup philosophy"", asking the models questions about how long they want to spend doing makeup on a daily basis, etc.) and not a lot in the way of makekup tips,  for example, there are only about 10 seconds on the eyebrow--I'm not exaggerating.  Laura talks about a minimal makeup routine, but then there are about 8 products in that routine.  The makeovers of ""real women"" are nice, perfectly appropriate for everyday, and the results she gets on an oriental woman with acne are very impressive.  Otherwise there was nothing here that you couldn't find in a good magazine like Redbook.  I was hoping for some insight into Mercier's glamour makeup, but her work in glamour was only mentioned at the beginning and ending in a somewhat misleading way.  Furthermore, the women being made up looked fine after they were made up--and so would you and I if Laura had done it; but doing it yourself is a different matter, and not addressed at all. Oddly, there is a credit at the end for ""Directed, Produced, and Written by..."" and that credit goes not to Laura Mercier, but to a man I've never heard of. Sadly, I can't recommend this video to anyone except perhaps Asian women with acne.",987465600,10,1537,4.687732342007435
7927423,2,B00004YNWP,"Laura Mercier may indeed be a very talented makeup artist when it comes to celebrities, who as we know are blessed with good looks by God. However while viewing this brief and rather primitive video I failed to notice dramatic changes after her makeover of 6 ""ordinary"" women. I didn't discover any new makeup tips for myself either. In my opinion this video is for people who have no idea about makeup whatsoever, as it provides  very limited and basic information on techniques and products. (Without saying,  Laura Mercier advertises her own skincare and makeup lines only). I also find  Laura's roundtable discussion about the purpose of makeup to be a waste of time in this 27 minute video. My expectations for this video were much higher.",976838400,26,744,4.84251968503937
7927424,5,B00004YNWP,"This is an excellent video for those who really want to explore the different makeup tips that Laura has mastered.  She is a true ""makeup artist"".  Although I thought that I knew plenty of makeup techniques, there were several that she used that I hadn't thought of.  Also there are different perspectives for  several different skintones/ types.  An excellent video indeed!",971222400,5,374,5.065573770491803
