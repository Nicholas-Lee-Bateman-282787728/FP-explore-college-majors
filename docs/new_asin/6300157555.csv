7803187,5,6300157555,"This was my sisters favorite movie as a child and I have searched for it for years.  When I saw it listed on Amazon by ""an Amazon user"" I was a little nervous it was a scam but I figured since it wasn't a lot of money it was worth a shot!  I was not disappointed!  The tape arrived early (in time for the holiday) and was in great condition!

7803190,4,6300157555,"I grew up watching this movie and to this day I am always mesmorized by the sheer imagation of the movie. Amy, a girl having troulbe writing a poem for school, talks with her stuffed animal pal, Wrinkles. To the joy of Amy,  Wrinkles comes alive and brings his family to help the distressed girl.  Mostly packed with high excitment music there is one slow-paced and  meaningful song. I believe that to be the only real down  and not so  enjoyable part of the movie, but that is my opinon. I don't think most  adults would appreciate the creative fun of the movie though kids will find  it a fantastic and incredible time.",961718400,2,621,4.442477876106195
