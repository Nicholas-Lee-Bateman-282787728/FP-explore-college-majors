8412349,2,B0040IDYNS,"To put it politely this was kind of a downer.  The majority of the movie was the filmmaker trying to find people and resources to make the movie and it showed him failing continually.  He was stresses and panicked yet very eager to make this film.  He didn't find a good quality of people to interview, not  all but most. It was like he was shooting too low.  Like attracts like!!.. in the Law of Attraction.  His continual focus in what wasn't working showed how hard everything was.  It was sad to watch, a poor guy desperately trying to find the way to riches.  I don't feel this was edited well, as it showed too many scenes of him making calls and hanging by the phone with rejection after rejection.  It didn't feel like a large revelation was achieved ... well if we buy this movie he will get richer but ...well I don't know what else to say but read ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon hill (the full unedited original text).  It is WAY MORE inspiring than this movie.
That's what motivated the filmmaker to make this movie; however a few very poignant points in the book were lost to him.",1391817600,,1096,4.354679802955665
8412350,5,B0040IDYNS,Excellent example of using the 17 principles in The Science of Success! I am a proud student of Nap's works.,1373068800,,108,4.45
8412351,5,B0040IDYNS,"Highly recommended!  Comprehensive, raw, genuine, and filled with inspiration...  Beautiful story of constant surrender.  ""Think and Grow Rich"" is a classic book that really started the entire Law of Attraction movement in today's culture, many of today's self help writers, enraptures, dreamers, and spiritual avatars mention the power of this book.  ""Awaken Your Riches"" is a perfect way to introduce your consciousness to this material, so BUY it and LOVE it.",1344211200,,462,5.464788732394366
8412352,5,B0040IDYNS,"This is a fabulous documentary on the principles of Napoleon Hill's ""Think and Grow Rich""

I wasn't sure what to expect with this film - I had seen the trailer, and it reminded me of The Secret, so I thought it might be a similar film, but it was refreshingly much more authentic.

Yes, there are some interviews and ""talking heads"" as there are in ""The Secret"" and ""What the Bleep"", but that wasn't the compelling and memorable part of the film - what I found fascinating was watching the documentary maker's journey as he made the film AND applied the principles to the making of the film. It was like a mesmerizing stack of Russian nesting dolls! You are actually watching the process of someone go from 0 to 1,000,000 as the film unfolds!

To watch Martin as he trusts the principles and then to see them work! It's amazing!

Everyone, and I mean everyone, who is the least bit interested in improving their life should take a look at this film to see how it can be done!",1293235200,4,975,4.4
8412353,4,B0040IDYNS,"I first heard about this dvd, because Wendy Robbins said she was in it.  I really like Wendy Robbins, because she has so much energy when she talks and her talks are motivating.  The editing in the movie is not that good.  I don't think there was a professional crew.  Just a guy with one camera.  Some of the camera angles really annoyed me.  Other than that, it was okay.  The special features is a plus with interviews of people talking about ""think and grow rich"".",1292976000,,468,4.372093023255814
8412354,5,B0040IDYNS,"I just received and watched the movie and LOVED it. I originally found out about it while taking Napoleon Hill's PMA Science of Success course. It is a fact that many people do not read. This movie will reach an audience that might otherwise never have learned of Napoleon Hill and an audience that knows and loves Napoleon Hill at the same time. You owe it to yourself to get buy it and watch it.

When I heard that this movie featured principles from the bestselling book ""Think and Grow Rich,"" I didn't know what to expect. This movie was very lifechanging. I will be purchasing copies to give away to everyone I truly care about.",1284076800,4,304,4.446428571428571
