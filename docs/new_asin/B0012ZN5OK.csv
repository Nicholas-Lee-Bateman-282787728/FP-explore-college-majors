8248542,4,B0012ZN5OK,"This Region 2 four-disc box set contains three Hello! Project concerts performed in Japan in January 2008, plus one bonus disc of backstage footage. The concerts are ""Wonderful Hearts Nenjuu Mu Kyuu,"" featuring Morning Musume and the younger groups, Berryz Koubo and C-ute; ""Kashimashi Elder Club,"" featuring H!P's older solo artists plus the groups, V-u-den, Melon Kinenbi, and Ongaku Gatas; and ""Kettei! Haro Pro Award '08,"" which features the combined lineups together (67 performers in all) at the massive Yokohama Arena on a stage with a runway circling around in front of the entire audience.

This is quite a collection of rousing, entertaining concerts featuring a distinct segment of energetic, bouncy, and exuberant J-pop that attracts its own unique subset of fans. My favorite of the set is, of course, the Elder Club, which gives the most experienced performers in H!P a chance to show how much better they keep getting (and how much more beautiful, too), as we see solo performances by Natsumi Abe, Yuko Nakazawa, Aya Matsuura, and Yuki Maeda, subgroups with Kei Yasuda, Ayaka Kimura, Atsuko Inaba and Mari Yaguchi, and numbers from V-u-den (in their farewell appearance); Melon Kinenbi, the longest-running group in Hello! Project with its membership intact; and the new unit, Ongaku Gatas, which features three former members of Morning Musume.

The great pleasure of the Elder Club concert was the attention given to the seven former members of Morning Musume on hand: Natsumi, Yuko, Mari, Kei, Hitomi Yoshizawa, Rika Ishikawa, and Asami Konno, who all come out together and do a set of old MM favorites, including ""Daite Hold on Me!,"" ""Happy Summer Wedding,"" ""Happy Night"" and, joined by the rest of the lineup, ""Renai Revolution 21."" This was the first time these seven have performed together as a group since 2001 and it marked a most joyous occasion, one that was tempered, however, by the notable absence, for various reasons, of six other former members, Kaori Iida, Maki Goto, Ai Kago, Nozomi Tsuji, Miki Fujimoto, and Makoto Ogawa, four of whom had been on last year's concert tour.

The current nine-member lineup of Morning Musume, including three girls who joined last year, gets short shrift in the two concerts in which they appear. They sing five songs--some of them lip-sync'd--in two different sets in the ""Wonderful Hearts"" concert and only three in the ""Kettei Haro Pro"" concert. The MM sets used to be the highlights of any H!P concert, but the days when they'd come out 15-girls-strong and knock out such powerhouse numbers as ""Do It! Now,"" ""Mr. Moonlight,"" ""Ai Araba, It's All Right"" and ""Souda! We're Alive,"" are long gone. Furthermore, the two younger groups, Berryz Koubo and C-ute, seem to be playing on a level plane with MM now. As MM's lineup has gotten younger, especially since Yossi and Miki left, Berryz and C-ute have both remained intact and--guess what?--gotten older. The four newest members of MM all have far less performing experience than anyone in Berryz and C-ute. So the whole hierarchy of these concerts has changed.

The final concert mixes repeats of various numbers from the other two concerts with some new ones, offering a fast-paced collection of short-and-sweet, high-energy numbers from the best performers in Hello! Project. And it's got a rousing three-song finale featuring the entire line-up, the last song being the celebrated ""All for One & One for All,"" the perfect ending for this exhilarating spectacle.

The backstage footage on disc 4 runs for 44 minutes and consists of bits from all the concerts, mostly the girls making quick, comical asides to the camera, all in Japanese with no subtitles, as they either head out to the stage or come back afterwards. You either find this kind of thing vastly entertaining or you don't. I do.",1213660800,2,3812,5.03486529318542
