Rating: 3.5 out of 5, 7.0 out of 10.0

What's the 'big deal' about 'Big Deal on Madonna Street?"" Well, it's a pretty amusing take on Italian Society in the late 50s. Strong suits include a bevy of neat character types, a plot that moves along at a saucy pace (except perhaps for a bit of a draggy denouement) and dialogue full of jokes, some of which are spot on and others that are probably lost in translation.

When a petty criminal, Cosimo, is locked up for breaking into a car, he soon gets wind inside the local jail, that there is safe full of jewels inside a pawnshop on Madonna Street in Rome, ripe for the taking. All he has to do is conscript his pals, gain entry into a vacant apartment next door and punch through a weak plaster wall, which leads directly to the safe in question. One problem remains: his sentence on the misdemeanor is keeping him locked up for months on end.

Cosimo calls upon an old geezer, ex-Jockey Capannelle, to find a 'scapegoat' who will confess to the crime and take his place in the lockup. Capannelle calls upon a motley group including Mario, a product of the Italian orphanage system, who is perennially unemployed, Michele Ferrite, a Sicilian hothead who keeps his sister under lock and key, ensuring that no man takes advantage of her and and Tiberio, an unemployed photographer who must take care of his infant son after his wife has been locked up for smuggling cigarettes. All these ne'er-do-wells refuse to accept Cosimo's cash offer of 100,000 lira as they all have records and will probably be given significant time despite pleading guilty to such a minor crime. They finally find a washed-up boxer, Peppe, who agrees to switch places with Cosimo. Both Cosimo and Peppe hit a snag when the sentencing Judge sees through the ruse and also sends Peppe to jail.

In one of the real neat scenes in the film, Peppe tricks Cosimo into revealing the location of the potential heist on Madonna Street. After returning from the sentencing Court, he acts as if he's been sentenced to three years and Cosimo suddenly takes pity on him, spilling the beans. Peppe then walks out laughing, indicating that in actuality, he's been sentenced to one year probation.

If there's one scene that doesn't work at all, it's when the crooks steal an old 8 millimeter movie camera from a flea market after Tiberio comes up with the lame brained idea of utilizing the camera's zoom lens to film the safe combination from a rooftop, as pawnshop employees can be seen periodically opening the safe through a window of the building across the street. The scheme is so ridiculous from the get go since it's obvious that no one could read the safe combination by using a cheap camera like that. I understand that the point is to show what a bumbling bunch this gang of crooks really is. Unfortunately, I believe, no one is THAT stupid and it reduces the characters to a bunch of buffoons.

Fortunately, that's only one scene and there are plenty of others that hit the mark. One very subtle jab at a certain 'character type' occurs after the group needs to raise money to hire a ""professional"" safe cracker to open the safe. Mario visits his ""mother"" and her friends, the other older women at the orphanage where he was raised. One very funny bit is when one of the women keeps insisting how ugly he is without any awareness of her lack of tact.

The story takes a darker turn during a short sequence when Cosimo, after his plan for the big heist has been stolen from him by his former pals, resorts to mugging women on the street and ends up being killed after being hit by a streetcar, following a chase by the police. The gang then gets together for his funeral and wax philosophical about the capriciousness of life. The unsophisticated Capannelle can only say something trite in front of his pals: ""feast or famine"".

Some judicious editing could have improved the final quarter of the film as the focus is on two long-winded subplots: Michele going after Mario who expresses his love for Michele's sister and Peppe's involvement with Nicoletta, who works for the two spinsters who inhabit the apartment which the gang must gain access to. I also felt the actual 'break-in' scene was much too long but after reading Wikipedia, I learned that it was designed to satirize ""Rififi"", a 1955 French heist film, which I have yet to see.

'Big Deal' ends nicely as there are no fatal consequences for any of the misguided group of thieves. After drilling through the wrong wall, they conclude that its best to abort the caper; but all's well that end's well, when they partake of leftovers in the refrigerator concocted by the endearing Nicoletta. Finally, Peppe gets his just desserts, when he's swept up in a crowd of men who are seeking work at a construction site--work, of course, is the last thing Peppe really wants to do but he has no choice to accept his fate.

'Big Deal on Madonna Street' perhaps suggests that the root of instability in society is tied to infidelity between men and women. Without a strong anchor (or shall we say, 'moral compass'), people are condemned to a lack of satisfaction precisely because of the lack of strong relationships between the sexes. Right after being locked up, Cosimo can only joke when he promises his girlfriend a fur coat if he and his confederates can pull off the big heist. His girlfriend replies she'd rather get married and Cosimo states he's only doing a few months and she wants to sentence him to life! It's a funny line, but indicative of something much more sad going on in 1958 Italy, and just as relevant to today's times as well.",1311033600,2,5659,4.626494023904383
704851,5,6303818331,"In order to fully appreciate the wit in this film it would be a good idea to have viewed Rififi des Hommes first.  Many elements of Rififi have been masterly ""borrowed"" and adapted with great success to a really funny film.  From a child being included to the services of a master safe cracker, from the empty adjoining property to the proposed heist's location, to the black and white format.  But what an amazing result.  Just to see a young and impossibly handsome Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni to the hilarious Toto as the master safe cracker who in this case sells his tools and advice but does not participate in the proposed heist.  If you wish a good heartfelt laugh this is the film to watch, all the more so if you are fluent in Italian, but the subtitles suffice.",1304899200,4,786,4.546099290780142
704852,4,6303818331,"The caper or heist film is surely the second most universally popular subset of the crime genre after the murder mystery, and I wonder if it was ever more in vogue, and more interesting artistically, than in the years after the huge success of GRISBI and RIFIFI. The late 50s and early 60s saw Melville's BOB LE FLAMBEUR, TOPKAPI, the early Pink Panther movies, and this fine neo-realist/comic effort from Monicelli, a director I've not heretofore been familiar with.

It's a rather odd film, with many shifts in tone and a rambling plot that really doesn't coalesce into anything approaching the crime story you might expect until about halfway through. A group of small-time crooks and ex-cons, among them Peppe (Vittorio Gassman), Dante (Toto), and Tiberio (Marcello Mastroianni) hit upon a plan to rob a pawnbroker's safe by going through the wall of a neighboring apartment while the tenants are away; but they are clearly so incompetent and half-hearted about the whole thing that we never really believe they're going to get anywhere with their plans. The real drama to the story lies in wondering just when and how they'll get caught and who will go to jail; the real miracle will be if they get away without losing anything, let alone winning through.

It's a portrait of a still desperately poor Italy just a few years after the war....there are still old, war-torn, decrepit buildings everywhere and the new ones we see going up are as ugly as anything being built in Poland at the time....everybody seems to know someone in prison or be a parolee him/herself.....so the comedy has a sombre edge to it, despite the presence of the farcical Toto, and the young and garrulous Mastroianni. Look for a very young Claudia Cardinale in a small role as well. Beautifully shot in a low-rent way in B/W by Gianni di Venanzo.

I should note that this Criterion edition doesn't have much of anything in the way of extras (trailer, that's it) and the titles aren't the greatest.  Not on the whole one of their better releases, and though I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece exactly, it deserves better.",1254441600,2,2105,4.806629834254144
704853,4,6303818331,"Ostensibly a send-up of the French caper classic, ""Rififi,"" ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" actually IS a big deal.  Personally, I found plenty of humor in the leak-proof, exhilarating predecessor, so the ironic meaning of ""Big Deal"" seems off the mark if the intention is to mock the childish, self-destructive games of professional jewel thieves.  ""Madonna"" is big in a more literal sense--physical, outrageous comedy that nevertheless manages to distinguish each of its unforgettable characters, balancing slapstick and surprise with humanism and pathos.

A film like this, moreover, could be made only by an Italian, or an Italian-American such as Frank Capra.  It's as distant from the Teutonic Hamlet-like brooding of Bergman or the achingly, ceremonial slow pace of Kurosawa or Ozu as you can get.  And it makes American comedies and buddy pictures, at least since ""Animal House"" and ""Butch Cassidy,"" seem like big klutzes by comparison.  From Capra to Fellini, Italian cinematic sensibility is essentially positive, upbeat, communal and comic, even if, as Rossellini and de Sica remind us, the social order is subject to the iron-clad materialistic challenges of living (just as the isolated protagonist we find in other national cinema is bound to a code of some noble personal order essential to self-actualization).  No cinema--not even Russian--seems more open to Marxist theoretical approaches than Italian (it's Bedford Falls, not George Bailey, that proves the true hero--or antagonist, as the case may be).

There's an additional reason to see this film as more than a send-up, merely, of a predecessor movie. ""Big Deal,"" like ""Riffi,"" has a moral and a message, which comes down to something like ""Never give into the machine let alone become one yourself.""  Like both Chaplin and Keaton, whose best films are also the result of painstaking, meticulous mechanical engineering (both filmmakers go for broke to 1. mechanize the human, as in the famous conveyor belt scene of ""Modern Times,"" and to 2. humanize the mechanical, as in the tarnished but never defeated Confederate locomotive run by Buster).  Mario Monicetti emulates the two founding fathers of film comedy in his attention to the details of editing, mis en scene, and acting.  And he recalls both the essentially comic vision and communal emphases of his fellow countryman, Frank Capra, in his construction of a little society that is (more or less) functional, ""democratic"" and, above all, living!

Trust the French to be existential about the inescapable and perennial problem of greed and its empty deserts; the Italians, on the other hand, take it more in stride.  No tragic potential here but plenty of misfortune--along with sadness that this vital and vibrant community, even though a dubious lot of thieves, in the end simply can't hold it together.  But it's important to note that they retain their ""integrity""--they're not about to submit to the indignity of ""work"" (a cake walk compared to all they've suffered while trying to make their fortunes the ""easy,"" or illicit, way).  Like ""The Bicycle Thief"" they are ultimately out of work, not to mention friends; the difference is that this rag-tag motley crew with a not-so-magnificent obsession is too shielded from the Marxist reality (that seems to occupy the margins of every Italian film) to understand ""why"" their failed caper should be a big deal.  A disappointment, to be sure.  Yet the viewer leaves with the feeling that it's all simply another day's work--or, more accurately, play--in the lives of Falstaff and company.  It's not Henry V: it's neither the end of Falstaff nor the triumph of the social-economic forces that will eventually lead to his dismissal. But it's a heck of a good time for viewers of any ethnicity, race, class, or gender.

[As the above paragraph suggests, ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" demands a sequel.  And it gets it 20+ years later, once again featuring Marcello Mastroianni.  But if it's a revisionary send-up, or parody, that you're looking for, try De Sica's ""The Bicycle Thief"" followed immediately by Maurizio Nichetti's ""The Icicle Thief""--two films that are a half century and worlds apart yet, upon reflection, offer a comparison that suggests the post-modern milieu of the present is not necessarily superior to the depressed post-World War Italy captured by De Sica's neo-realist classic.]",1251244800,2,4376,5.1875
704854,5,6303818331,"I might be stretching it a bit to give ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" a 5 star rating but I rounded it to the nearest score.  I did so because of the understated quality of the humor in the movie.  I was rather easily led along the story line which got more and more complicated as each minor difficulty resulted in another misdirection.  By the time the movie was in full swing, the twists, turns and obstacles kept things hopping.

The acting and directing were very good.  There are some familiar names and a lot of new actors (to an American audience).  The beauty of the movie is the seriousness of the players contrating to the inanity of the script.  This is a movie that movie lovers ought to see at least once in their lives; just for the fun of it.",1209859200,,756,4.28169014084507
704924,5,6303818331,"A brilliant spoof of caper films like Jules Dassin's ""Rififi,"" Monicelli's manic romp is crowd-pleasing in every way, thanks to hilarious performances from Gassman, Mastroianni, Renato Salvatori, and the rest of the ebullient cast. Monicelli focuses as much on his sad-sack characters as he does the details of the heist, and it's impossible not to find these inept robbers--who drill a hole through the wrong wall--completely endearing. Mastroianni, as buffoonish photographer turned car thief Tiberio, is a gas, even up against fabled funnyman Toto (as a scene-stealing, semi-retired burglar). Watch, too, for a young Claudia Cardinale. Filmed on location in Italy, ""Madonna"" was remade as ""Crackers"" in 1984, minus the uproarious laughs.",1182902400,,740,5.616071428571429
704925,5,6303818331,"Tall, handsome Vittorio Gassman stars as Peppe, the womanizing glass-jawed palooka who, along with several keystone criminals, stumblebum their way to...not much.  Also featured in this comedy by Italian film legend Mario Monicelli are Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale, who would go on to fame and fortune, but here have only modest parts.  Mastroianni, who would later star in La Dolce Vita (1960), Il Bell'Antonio (1960), Divorzio all'italiana (1961) and many others, plays Tiberio a photographer without a camera, whose wife is in jail, who has a constantly crying baby to take care of with one of his arms up in a sling with a board under it.  Cardinale, who would go on to become one of Italy's most famous beauty bombshells, plays Carmelina, a young woman locked up by her brother in order to protect her honor until she marries.

Also featured are Carla Gravina (Nicoletta), a very pretty 17-year-old who went on to only a modest career, and the veteran Toto who plays the incompetent safecracker, Dante Cruciani.  Notable is Renato Salvatori as Mario who wins Carmelina's heart, Memmo Carotenuto as Cosimo who fails at purse-snatching, and Carlo Pisacane as Capannelle who looks like an aged member of the Bowery Boys.

The story begins when Cosimo is caught trying to steal a car.  In prison he learns of a nice sting that he can pull off if only he can get out of jail.  So he tries to hire a scapegoat to confess to the crime so he can be freed.  Finally Peppe, after getting knocked out in the first round of a prize fight, decides he needs the money.  However when he goes to confess, the police see through the ruse and throw him in jail without releasing Cosimo.  But Peppe does get out, and he and the motley assortment of would-be jewel thieves plot their crime amid hilarious missteps, pratfalls and mass confusion as they break into an apartment that they have the keys for to knock down a wall (which wall?) to gain access to a safe they probably can't crack.  Will they succeed despite all the mishaps?

There is a sense of both recovery and poverty in post World War II Italy in the backdrops and the asides and the circumstances of the characters that lend to this comedy a realistic edge.  We see the petty thievery as an understandable and almost acceptable way of life, at least for the time being.  Mario always buys or steals three identical things for his ""mother"" who turns out to be three women who raised him at the orphanage.  Tiberio has to sell his camera and then steal one.  Skinny Capannelle is always eating.  And in the jail several men share one cigarette while they blow the smoke into a bottle to capture it so that others might get a little nicotine as well!  (Sure, and I have some gum I can recycle.)

The Criterion Collection DVD that I viewed has excellent yellow subtitles, but some of the lines come so fast and with such comedic as well as denotative intent that it is easy to miss something.  Knowing Italian would help!

See this for all the ""bumbling criminal"" movies that it both imitated and inspired, and for the fine work by the talented cast.",1180656000,4,3111,4.638686131386861

For anyone who loves this movie as much as I do, I recommend to see its sequel made a year later by Nanni Loy: ""Audace Colpo dei Soliti Ignoti"", with only the  absence of Mastroianni but the addition of Nino Manfredi- Sure it's not as great as the first, but having liked these characters so much it is natural that one would want to see them back in action with yet another ""scientifically"" schemed project along with all their mishaps as usual...and of course, a little more of the unfolding romance of the couple portrayed by Claudia Cardinale and Renato Salvatori.

With the music and visual gags, I thought Woody Allen was going to appear any second (watch this for influences on ""Small Time Crooks"").  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is not for the movie itself, but because of the subtitles.  I hate to get picky or get dark on Criterion, but sometimes the subtitles flash on the screen without nearly enough to time to read them, and that just isn't necessary in most cases.  Most often there would be enough time to keep them on the screen longer before another one comes up.

This is an early caper film very much in the vein of ""IL Bidone"" where we follow the activities of an inept and bungling cadre of not very bright would-be thieves in their misguided attempt to rob a business on Madonna Street.  The entire plot is played for humor with the outcome always in doubt, but a foregone conclusion.  Monicelli deftly directs his ensemble cast of characters in an almost surrealistic atmospheric world of criminal losers, some of which are retired, (and should have stayed so.)
The caper is engrossing as it unfolds and the viewer really roots for the unlikely success of the perpetrators.  One of the diverse group of supporting players is Marcello Mastroianni, in one of his better roles.  The cast also includes Vittorio Gassman and Toto,
with a very young Claudia Cardinale appearing in an almost insignificantly small part.  Big Deal is a fun watch and Criterion has
done a beautiful job in creating and releasing a pristine new digital transfer from the original film elements.  The new subtitles are easy to read, even though they flash on the screen almost too fast for a speed reader.  I recommend Big Deal because of the
