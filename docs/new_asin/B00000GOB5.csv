The videos are educational as well as entertaining.  I enjoy selecting my favorite teams and participants in the race.  I have been very disappointed that the Eco-Challenge no longer takes place.",1250985600,,336,5.283018867924528
8324651,5,B00000GOB5,"I put this video in for the 30 minutes or so that I run on the treadmill each day and it inspires me to great things!  These are not spoiled, pampered over-paid athletes that compete.  They are people like all of us  and most of them are well into their 40's and above.  Their effort is  unbeleivable.  The video also has great stories, wonderful photography and  fantastic quotes about nature and the environment.",917308800,5,414,4.589041095890411
