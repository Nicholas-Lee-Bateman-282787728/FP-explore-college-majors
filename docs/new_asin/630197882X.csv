402656,3,630197882X,"The story-book setting and costumes are a flaming anachronism, the ballets are a bit silly...and yet, every once in a while, I do go back to it.  Leslie Caron as the misunderstood stepchild is very touching, and Estelle Winwood spouting illogical-seeming knowledge and stealing everything in sight is a great cause for smiles.  A Hollywood film great for kids, but doesn't totally neglect the adults either.",1101254400,7,407,5.151515151515151
402657,3,630197882X,"I remember seeing this years ago, presented as a special edition of a family TV anthology (this gives you an idea of how old I am; anthologies are but a thing of the past now). One of the things I immediately warmed to was the fact that they dispense with much of the conventional magic known from the original fairy tale: the fairy godmother is given a specific name and personality- and portrayed as something of a neighborhood kook who loves funny words and even steals. When she helps Ella (only given a 'Cinder' prefix by those who tease her) go to the ball she borrows a coach, steals a gown, and has to make her charge over herself. Leslie Caron, a positively beautiful dancer in her early years, is made to look less pretty than she really is, and the film teaches a rather sizable lesson by making the stepsisters conventionally beautiful for once- but still with poisoned personalities. With this scenario, we are allowed to judge the central character by her spirit, intelligence, and wistfullness (something that would be re-imagined 40 years later in the film EVER AFTER)- knowing all along that she will be rewarded in the end. It is also a sweet change that the prince and Ella meet before seeing each other at the ball- creating a real love story (which is further explored in the Roland Petit fantasy ballets- 'the son of the cook,' and so on). It is a shame that Leslie Caron did not continue to dance on film after this year; all of her subsequent films after 'Gigi' (a musical without dance sequences) were straight dramas. Check this out; it is one of MGM's lesser known, but evey bit as impressive.",1060560000,32,1620,4.589655172413793
402658,5,630197882X,"This is a great Cinderella story. If your son or daughter likes Cinderella, I think they will like this movie too. The Prince is soooooo hot.",1042416000,5,141,4.461538461538462
402659,5,630197882X,"They sure don't make movies like this anymore. ""The Glass Slipper"" is a truly beuatiful film. I've seen it many times. There are some very tender moments and wonderful ballet sequences. It's a film well worth seeing . Leslie Caron and Michael Wilding make a very romantic couple in it.  Michael Wilding is a true Prince, so charming and kind.  Leslie Caron is very pretty and shy.",995241600,4,380,4.656716417910448
402660,5,630197882X,"THE GLASS SLIPPER is a magical, poetic and charming new telling of the Cinderella tale.
Leslie Caron plays Ella, the soot-covered heroine, who is the bane of all the townfolk's insults and jokes, and she is alone and friendless.
Enter the dotty Mrs Toquet (Estelle Winwood) who becomes her confidant and trusted friend, and who is an incurable kleptomaniac to boot!
Michael Wilding as the dashing Prince, Elsa Lanchester as Widow Sonder and Amanda Blake and Lisa Daniels as the sisters Birdena and Serafina all add color and whimsy to the proceedings.
The score is by Bronislau Kaper (FOREVER DARLING, LILI) and the ballet sequences are handled by Roland Petit and the Paris Ballet.",977270400,35,682,4.991228070175438

402702,2,630197882X,"I hadn't seen this in decades and remembered it better than when I saw it just now.  The different plot for this Cinderella movie

I disliked the narration and cutesy words and unfortunately I disliked the 2 major ballets done as dreaming sequences.  I love Lesley Caron especially for An American in Paris and I think she was a fantastic dancer.  I like her ""rolling"" down the stairs in a ballet-elegant way and that scene was the one I most remembered from the original viewing.  The music was great.

I like Michael Wilding, very aristocratic and with a pretty good singing voice (when he was ""playing"" the pianoforte or harpsichord. The supporting cast was very good, especially Estelle Winwood, the thieving fairy godmother.",1499731200,,729,4.8861788617886175

402737,4,630197882X,"I am a long time can off cinderella. Not entirely sure why, considering for the most part she is a wildly inefficient heroine....doormat (only if you lay on the ground and LET people walk on you can you be a doormat) who allows the world to save her instead of simply saving herself. Nonetheless....this cinderella is whiney, abrassive, aggressive, a bully and mean. Somehow prone charming finds her crying and bullying endearing, and in spite of lying to her she falls for him. They get married all aft er lengthy daydreams in which cinderella firmly establishes that she would do nothing of use in the palace. That said the acting is...standard for a 1950s, the actress is famine as heck, the Prince actually charming, and the step family is unpleasant rather than evil....which is a wonderful turn around from the usual schtick. Enjoyable, glad I bought out. Exemplaryv film from the 50s.",1457568000,,891,4.868421052631579

The ballroom dance scenes and the cake dance are full of life personality, and Leslie Caron is enchanting and charming as an adorably quirky and feisty Cinderella. The soundtrack is also a treasure. The whistfully beautiful ""Take My Love"" never fails to induce a faraway smile and a sigh.

402967,4,630197882X,"Unlike most Cindella's this one doesn't sing but she can sure dance. This despite what the case looks like is a full movie and not a ballet. Leslie Caron plays an spirited, feisty, and oddly independent Cindella. She has much to say for herself and the prince likes her before she is seen in all her finery. The ballets meld well into the rather faniful fairy tale, and it not a simple retelling.

Leslie Caron is exquisite  and the dream ballet scenes make the whole movie. The movie is rather endearing in its simplicity and seemed timeless. In an age where there were no computers, the dance scenes are  just out of this world. The acting, though it may not be Oscar material is fine and believable.  I can view this over and and over and would never tire of  it. Adults who still appreciate clean movies can enjoy this. Children definitely will  love this with no scary surprises  that characterize modern adaptations of the fairy tales.

Being a dancer at the time, I loved the ballet scenes and dreamed of perhaps pursuing that road.  But I also loved the realistic magic of the Cinderella story.  And the role of the fairy godmother is the best ever.  Being a newcomer, Leslie Caron showed her acting skills.  All in all, I knew I was in a make-believe world, but at that time young girls dreamed of such possibilities. And I loved the ending and the fact that stepmother and stepsisters were not as evil as previously portrayed.

What a joke, she is nothing of the kind, and it wouldn't surprise me that they would make excuses for the family's mistreatment of her.  I like Michale Wilding as the Prince, and since he never danced ballet before, in my view he was ok.  As always Lesile Caron is great.  Such grace etc.  Don't take this the wrong way Lesile, but I hate you! Of course it goes without saying that I'm joking.  Of all the films about the story of Cinderella, this one I like the best.

And Cinderella falls in love with him believing him to be the son of the cook, not knowing he's the prince. Leslie Caron's Cinderella is the most sympathetic of Cinderella's and Michael Wilding's Prince Charles is the most charming of Prince Charmings... courteous, kind, and handsome.  What a great movie!

403052,5,630197882X,"""The Glass Slipper"" is a modern interpretation of the classic fairy tale. And it's a good one. Leslie Caron is cast as Ella, a girl almost destroyed by the death of her mother and the lack of understanding shown her by her insensitive stepmother (Elsa Lanchester) and haughty stepsisters (""Gunsmoke's"" Amanda Blake, and Lisa Daniels.) The local villagers are likewise indifferent to her, and (as narrator Walter Pigeon dryly observes), her spirit is in danger of being broken as a result. Enter local ""madwoman/kleptomaniac"" Estelle Winwood, who, simply by reaching out to the defiant girl, gives her confidence and hope. Yes, she's the film's equivalent of the fairy godmother, and she is wonderful in the part. Although the prince (a mature Michael Wilding) leaves a bit to be desired in the dancing department, he is perfectly all right otherwise. Keenan Wynn is wasted as his companion, but Barry Jones is amusing as the prince's father, and Miss Lanchester makes a suitably nasty stepmother. But what of Leslie Caron? Well, she goes from neglected little spitfire to luminous princess effortlessly, and her appearance at the ball is a treat. The ballet sequences do tend to slow the film down, but Miss Caron did begin her career as a dancer, and she has a grace few others could match. The music by Bronislaw Kaper perfectly enhances the mood, as does the modest but tasteful production. Strangely enough, this could be called the original ""Ever After"", because, except for a delightful twist at the end, the tale is told as if it could have happened. All in all, a captivating version of ""Cinderella"", and one which will linger in your memory. [phillindholm]",1134777600,39,1665,4.971326164874552

Ella is bullied partly because her real mother was told by a fortune teller (before Ella was born) that Ella was going  to live in the palace one day... and Ella as a child was apparently not shy about sharing that prediction with others, after her mother died.
