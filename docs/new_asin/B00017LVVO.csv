8007633,3,B00017LVVO,"This movie is pretty much an unoffical remake of Cooley High. You wouldn't know that until an exact scene from Cooley High is seen in this movie. After that this movie follows Cooley High with some different twists.
Jamal (writer), Kaisean (boxer) and Carlos are in their senior year of high school and end up making some wrong choices.
The boys get involved with two other guys and steal from a snack factory. They get arrested while in school and it follows Cooley High's plot from there until the death of one of the boys and it's not who you think.
Not a bad movie, but it looks like the writer watched Cooley High and did the script at the same time.",1085702400,,655,4.377049180327869
