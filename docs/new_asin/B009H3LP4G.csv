5334759,5,B009H3LP4G,"One of the most original horror movies I have seen in a long time. Writer, director Dustin Mills delivers again with this balls to the wall movie about a young man who has to make a decision weather to live or die and how that decision effects the people around him. This movie has blood, boobs and tentacles, what more do you need.",1359072000,,332,4.285714285714286
5334760,5,B009H3LP4G,"This is movie is hilarious. One of the best low budget horror films I have seen in a while. It has a strong story along the lines of Little Shop Of Horrors, its  very well shot and has a great mixture of practical and CGI FX.

5334761,5,B009H3LP4G,This was a brilliant low-budget creature feature with a unique plot and mad acting from Brandon Salkil. Buy it unless you want to be discontent with your life.,1359072000,,159,4.714285714285714

BEWARE, I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAMS THE NIGHT AFTER VIEWING THIS! The most disturbing film i've seen since, ""Phantasm""!",1358812800,,253,4.644444444444445
5334763,4,B009H3LP4G,A fantastic movie from up-and-coming director Dustin Mills. Mills is doing so many things better than most of the indie horror crowd at 1/100th the budget. This one is a rip-roaring good time from start to finish! Pick this one up today if you're a fan of sleazy no-budget cinema!,1358812800,,280,4.62

8541451,2,B009H3LP4G,"This semi-art house, semi-perverse film is only for lovers of true indie horror.  That said, this was well-done considering its shoestring budget.

After suffering some serious heart complications, fantasy erotica artist David (Bath Salt Zombies, Easter Casket) strikes a deal with the Devil for a new heart.  He didn't turn to Medicaid or venture to Canada for cheaper solutionsnope.  The Devil had just what he needed.  And with that David's heart is replaced by a tentacle monster in a wooden chest.  Just one problem:  the monster needs to be fed living flesh in order to survive.  The monstrous heart is eloquently voiced by an Bill Nighy sound-alike.

Writer/director Dustin Mills (Bath Salt Zombies) clearly made an effort with this script.  His writing is far from brilliant, but he definitely deserves credit for delivering far more than I've come to expect from the vast majority of direct-to-DVD horror.  Theatrical devices like overt melodrama, narration and asides add an irregular flavor to this film.  Whereas this flavor may please the art house crowd, some may find it over-the-top and distasteful.

Speaking of distasteful  Is there a lot of sexuality and perversion?  Yes.  But I see it as being used more as an exploitative ""device"" than purely as a crutch to cover the film's shortcomings.  There's masturbation, which seems to reveal our protagonist's desperation, and nudity, which does not utilize the typical stripper-cast actresses. There are also several sex scenes with little to no nudity.

Some of the acting in this is real crap (sorry, but I'm referring especially to Dustin Mills' cameo) and the effects are about as cheap as they come.  But considering this film had a budget of about $1500, I think I'll let it slide.  If you can make anything that entertains me for that cheap, then you've succeeded as a filmmaker.  The closing action sequence is awful and fun.

I should note that whereas this film is not nearly as deep or art house-ish as Lo (2009), the style is similar enough to warrant comparison.  Those who love true indie horror will likely enjoy this film.  But just because you consider yourself an adventurous horror-goer, that doesn't mean this is for you.",1400544000,,2206,4.997252747252747
8541452,1,B009H3LP4G,"Dustin Mills wrote, directed, played Satan, provided the special effects, produced, provided the music and edited the film which he shot entirely in his Ohio apartment. Dave (Brandon Salkil) who draws dirty pictures for a living, has a heart attack while choking his chicken...a man's worse fear. He makes a deal with the devil to survive. Dave keeps his heart in a box as this Faustian tale takes on aspects of ""Little Shop of Horrors.""

The dialouge ranged from bad to campy fair. Unfortunately the acting was really sad with fake voices. The special effects were cheap. There is a scene of blood explosion. The ""boobs"" bragged about on the DVD cover aren't worth watching attached to pot bellied actresses.

The funniest scenes are the sex scenes where the guy screws up the dirty talk. The film is designed to be campy, but misses the entertaining aspect.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and nudity...it opens that way.",1379894400,2,921,4.891025641025641
8541453,1,B009H3LP4G,"I was curious as to wether or not this would be worth checking out as many of the reviews were rather positive.
Well, I watched it last night and let me tell you something, it doesn't matter how good someone can make a movie with what he has if all he has is a budget of 1.85 $.
Seriously, there's a part in this movie where your watching the main actor pretend or ""act"" like a tentacle thing is trying to rip his face off or some such and as I watched this it was painfully obvious that the tentacle thing is a red rope with a crappy plastic? claw at the end of it and I could not visualize it for what it was suppose to be, but for what it actually was.
Which is a guy struggling with a red rope with a crappy plastic claw at the end of it.
There's all of five different actors in this movie as that's all Dustin Mills could afford.
I could probably make a better monster in my sleep. (the thing is awful looking production wise)
The story has a few giggles nestled in there but most of his attempts at humour fell flat for me.
In re-cap, you can pour your heart and soul into a movie but you can't make water out of wine.
Avoid unless you want a real good idea of what a low, borderline infinitesimally small budgeted movie is inevitably going look like.
I've got more money hiding in between the cushions of my couch.

8541454,1,B009H3LP4G,I don't mind watching low budget horror movies but this movie is about as entertaining as prison rape with sand paper condoms.,1365206400,,126,4.7727272727272725
8541455,2,B009H3LP4G,Acting below par and story very slow. Title is misleading as far as I'm concerned. OK if you LOVE this kind of movie,1364601600,,116,4.086956521739131
8541456,5,B009H3LP4G,"From the very begining of Dustin Mills' film, it's evident that budget was and issue.  There is no denying it.  But something very strange happens as you watch.  It transends it's restraints and becomes the kind of B-movie fun Joe Bob Briggs would eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  A sort of acid trip-Troma version of Donnie Darko (I know, right?), with some serious undertones that were welcome in a genre that normally would ignore such things.  This is Skinemax material all the way and don't be suprised if you start recognizing the name Dustin Mills soon.  The man puts in his time and the effort shows.  This movie is NOT for everyone, but it IS for everyone who loves ""blood, boobs, slime, tentacles and laughs"", as the lush DVD packaging suggests on the cover.  Enjoy and support True Independent Film!",1361664000,,815,4.7304964539007095
8541457,5,B009H3LP4G,"Wow I sat down to watch this movie and didn't really know what to expect given the synopsis and knowing I was in store for yet another Dustin Mills production.  Like Puppetmonster Massacre and Zombie A-Hole this movie was equally funny as it was sickening and brilliant.  The sound effects, the colorization, the visual effects...all more than very well done for a film of this budget.  True independent horror at it's finest and I know independent horror very well...there really isn't a lot of grey area for me.  It's either terrible or well done.  But I really don't see anything terrible coming out of Dustin Mills.  The story goes of a young 24 year old man searching for love, listening to his neighbors hump every night, and in bad need of a heart transplant.  Dave soon discovers that satan is watching over him and decides to make a deal for his heart.  Of course our friend did not read the fine print and the heart ends up needing to feed which includes Dave's own pet dog.  I kept thinking of the films of Frank Hennennlotter while watching this most especially Brain Damage but most definitely done in Dustin Mills style.  Every actor in the film did very well most especially Brandon Salkil and Nicole Gerity something I usually have to look past in independent films like this and it's nice not to have to do so.  Highly recommended for lovers of independent films like me.",1359331200,,1388,4.624489795918367
8541458,5,B009H3LP4G,Dustin struck gold again. It's hard to believe this was all filmed in one location! Support true indie filmmaking greatness with this one.,1359244800,,138,5.043478260869565
