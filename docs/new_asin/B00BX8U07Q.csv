5680217,5,B00BX8U07Q,There is not a lot out there  beyond Bruce's albums so when I saw this I had to have it .ive seen him live twice in 1987 and this past march and I really enjoy anything he does . I always feel better after hearing him sing play guitar or just talk,1376265600,2,247,3.75
5680218,5,B00BX8U07Q,"Unless you are fortunate enough to have an extended visit with Mr. Cockburn, this documentary is your opportunity to turn the photograph over and read the writing on the back.

If Cockburn's music resonates in your spirit, get this DVD.  You won't be disappointed.",1374883200,3,264,4.9772727272727275
5680219,3,B00BX8U07Q,"This is an enjoyable 1 hour documentary that I found fairly interesting to watch the first time after it aired on television. When I just watched it again in the dvd release I realized that it is seriously lacking as any kind of document of Bruce Cockburn's life and career. As a document of this one solo tour in 2008 it gets the job done I suppose.

Bruce's amazing musicianship and songwriting skills do of course come through in the songs he plays - some snippets and some full length songs. Although I did find the concert footage a bit sterile. I could tell that an audience was present but they are not shown and there is no interaction by Bruce with them. At any of the dozen Bruce shows I've been to(and the many live recordings I've heard) there is a palpable connection between audience and performer. A real love for Bruce that is manifest by the audience laughing at any mildly witty thing he says and even people unable to restrain themselves from shouting out song requests or asking questions. None of this comes through at all in these performances. I'm not saying they aren't quality performances but Bruce could almost be playing to an empty room.

There are a lot of people in this film saying how wonderful Bruce is in regard to his songwriting skills, his guitar playing, his spirituality and his activism. None of this is new to anyone who has been a fan for a while, so there are few revelations here.  My favorite part part of the documentary is a very revealing couple minutes where Bruce opens up and shares how disappointed he was with his performance that particular night. Bernie, his long-time manager, reinforces how often this is the case - Bruce not satisfied with himself. This was amazing and interesting to me. My impression of Bruce is that he is never really OFF in concert and it really surprised me this revelation of his personality. I wish they had delved into this deeper, but we were soon back into more familiar adulatory waters.

This is certainly a worthwhile purchase for any Bruce fan. I would also recommend the 2001 documentary My Beat, also short but it covers his early years a little bit.

I will say something here though. Bruce is at the top of my list of favorite artists. I've been a fan for 3 decades and have listened to more Bruce music than any other artist. I love that Bruce has been so prolific, that the quality of his work has remained consistently amazing throughout his career, and the fact that he tours in my neck of the woods regularly. What I don't like is the flip side of the coin. Bruce is always looking forward, never backward. So this is the sort of thing we get (if we get anything at all) when it comes to a dvd release or anything archival (remasters notwithstanding). As far as concert video releases there is a VHS release from '81, and a couple semi-official things in the 80's. No dvds to speak of. No archival live cds, no box sets. Bruce's early formative years when he was very popular in Canada are almost completely undocumented in live video, even among collectors.

How about a genuine multi-disc documentary covering all eras of Bruce's career with complete songs from the 70's through today?
Some archival live shows from the early years? A box set with unreleased tracks and rarities? A coffee table book with Bruce pictures and lyrics from his archives? We have seen many lesser artists get these things. Bruce is just as deserving.",1372464000,26,3430,4.59640522875817

8574995,4,B00BX8U07Q,"This is a great documentary for fans; i.e. it ""preaches to the choir"" somewhat, so those new to Bruce may feel - after watching this - that he must walk on water.  And while I believe he's the greatest singer/songwriter/guitar-player out there, it would still be nice to have a more neutral approach to his work and history. In line with that, it would also be nice to have a little longer running time, as this is just over an hour.  Still, I expect it will be fairly regular watching material for me, so take my critique for what it's worth....",1492128000,,546,4.396039603960396
