3597131,5,B001G6LJ3O,"You will not regret buying this movie! Definitely watch it with the whole family! An inspring story of a father coming home to be the spiritual leader of his family as God commands and, by grace and prayer (and the support of his wife!!), succeds with glorious results. A beautiful picture of what a Christian family should look like, no matter where you live.",1358553600,,360,4.640625
3597132,5,B001G6LJ3O,"This was interesting to watch.  Document's one family's journey to change their lives from the rat race of professional, fast-paced careers to a God and family focus, living off the land and eventually becoming missionaries to Israel.",1352851200,2,234,5.324324324324325
3597133,5,B001G6LJ3O,I heard about this movie from a friend and it has become one of my favorite movies!  It's a very heartwarming documentary of one family's journey away from the hustle and bustle of society to a quiet life filled with family and the roots of their faith.  Very inspiring!,1314576000,,270,4.489795918367347
3597134,5,B001G6LJ3O,"What a lovely view of family and home life!  We have owned this film for several years now and watch it several times a year.  Sherry is the Titus 2 older woman you always wish you had.  You will be encouraged by their family, whether you are a husband, wife or child!  If you are into organic farming you will be encouraged.
You will see their family farming together, learning together, selling produce together, worshipping and singing together.  Just beautiful!
We were honored to meet them in person in 2008 and they are just as sweet and kind in person as they are in this DVD.
Highly Recommended!",1298332800,5,603,4.546296296296297
3597135,5,B001G6LJ3O,"This family is packed full of passion and love.  Not a love and pursuit of the american dream that so many people chase today; but for their family especially their children.  This is a dvd that is worth, not just purchasing; but investing in.  You can and should watch this and continue to have this inspiration right at your finger tips.  I loved viewing this video and will watch it many times.  This family has such a sense of humility that my heart just smiled.  What a wonderful Godly family.  Thank you!!!!",1269561600,,513,4.510869565217392
3597136,5,B001G6LJ3O,"What a great story!!! This family truly fulfills the American dream... working with your own hands, following the Godly example of your parents and helping the community. Our family sat in silence as we watched this family transform into young adults and children that were confident, well able to work and eager to help others. I highly recommend this film!  kp",1253577600,7,362,4.934426229508197

3597139,4,B001G6LJ3O,"This is not a major motion picture, thank goodness.  Otherwise the language would be so bad it wouldn't be for kids.",1473724800,,116,4.523809523809524
3597140,1,B001G6LJ3O,"Five minutes into the movie I was in despair at the thought of having to follow the adventures of this adolescent who was so stupid that I had to wonder how he'd survived past toddlerhood.  Sure, lets bring a bear-cub into our bedroom and play wrestling games with him.  No problem. There is just NO way this could possibly end badly, right?

And the stupidity then gets worse, as he decides to bring said bear-cub 'home' to his mama who had been (sensibly) removed from the village and taken to a more suitable location far, far away.  Hopping onto a snowmobile with few supplies, no spare fuel, no map, and a polar bear cub cozily tucked into a sled being pulled behind, idiot-child heads off 100 miles into an uncharted wilderness of melting sea-ice.

Risking, of course, the life of the man who then has to head out after him.  (A man who, in his initial scene appeared to be, more or less, the voice of reason [telling idiot-child that life in the arctic is tough, and sometimes bear cubs die ....] but is soon taken in by cuteness of both bear-cub and idiot-child, and continues to risk his life beyond all reason to help idiot-child complete his quest ... or at least rescue him.  He should've let the kid drown.

I won't completely spoil the film by listing everything that idiot-child does ... but the list is impressive. Even more impressive is how he somehow manages to NOT die from hypothermia ... repeatedly ... despite being drenched in freezing water for hours, stranded on an ice floe for hours,  wandering in an arctic blizzard for hours, and  out on open water in a small, leaky boat for hours and too stupid to even put his hood up. And how he manages to not get devoured by mama bear at the end of the film.

Positives?  Nice arctic scenery.  Despite some rather questionable casting of Visnjic as the half Inuit arctic guide  (sure -- I guess accents are interchangeable, right?) he provides about the only decent acting in the whole piece and is always easy on the eyes.

Oh, and the DVD has no captions and no extras.",1470614400,5,2040,4.505434782608695

3597155,3,B001G6LJ3O,"This is an amazing comedy, but a poor drama. It's impossible to watch this film without asking questions about why the main character continues to repeat horrendously stupid mistakes. It's as if he has a death wish. Darwin's ideas about ""survival of the fittest"" do not apply to the kid who this movie focuses on. It's such a bad movie, that it is almost good because you can't help but laugh and wonder what might happen next. This film belongs in the same category as ""Sharknado."" Also, the ending would've been better if the Polar Bear would've eaten the kid, just to top it off.",1448150400,,582,4.552380952380952

3597158,1,B001G6LJ3O,"Just watched it on netflix. It was hard to watch because the kid seemed so stupid like he had no business being in the wild. He speeds thru  and iced over lake or ocean area that is craking up all around him him till he wipes out a snowmobile and sinks it and almost killing himself. it just looked stupid watching it so I fast forwarded the show to see if it got better. When I stopped the fast forward it stoped and after a minute he comes upon a boat and takes one or two steps backward and trips over a paddle and hits his head and knocks him out. It just looked totally stupid and clumsy and not realistic. Then the boat he finds just laying on the ground covered in snow and he turns it over and finds paddles a everything there to make a sail and not knowing nothing about the boat ""since he just found it"" he then gets the bear inside and pushes it into the freezing ocean were hypothermia can kill you if there are leaks in the boat, not to mention no life jacket. Every move just looked very stupid and dangerous.  Only good thing about the movie was watching the bear. The humans were terrible in it.",1446508800,4,1111,4.138888888888889

3597172,5,B001G6LJ3O,"I love this documentary. As a newly wed and starting to think about raising a family I sincerely worry about the way society is moving. I'm 25 and I realize something is not right with the ""daily grind"" that literally leads no where. My husband and I hope to one day emulate this family (maybe not with that many children ;) but definitely the simplicity and family centered ways they live their daily lives. I also love the traditional aspect of this family. I have always been of the thought that women nowadays have been lied to about the corporate ladder and working outside the home is how women are empowered.... As a college educated woman who works a job I can say without a shadow of a doubt that I am happiest when I am at home doing ""woman's"" work. Working outside the home is miserable and is just another reason the simple life calls to me. Now, those who enjoy the corporate rat race that's fine but not all women find it desirable. If you are of christian beliefs or just really love the idea of a traditional family focused on loving each-other and self sustainability you will LOVE this documentary.",1392595200,5,1116,4.502463054187192

3597175,5,B001G6LJ3O,"This is one of the most inspiring and encouraging DVDs I've seen in years.  There is a gentleness and humility about this family that one rarely sees these days.  It was also a blessing to see the mother and some of the little girls wearing the prayer coverings, and they all dressed so modestly.  I would love to hear what has happened to this dear family since the making of this DVD.  ~Hannah",1377993600,,395,4.36986301369863

8304111,2,B001G6LJ3O,"I would never let my impressionable children watch this, because this would be such a bad influence on them. The main character was extremely selfish and spoiled, and he made such shameful, horrible decisions that put multiple lives in danger. Even after he was rescued and saved from death by volunteers who risked their lives for him, he then went out into the wilderness again and risked multiple people's lives again. He was irrational, arrogant and should have been punished for all of the life-threatening damage that he caused. --Instead, he was revered as a hero!
