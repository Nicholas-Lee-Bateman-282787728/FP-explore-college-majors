8554556,2,B00AN87CQE,Boring matches that either went to long or to short and out of shape wrestlers (yes you Franchise!) are mostly what you will get from this first show from Extreme Rising. Luckily Jerry Lynn and Dangerous Devon Storm showed up to tear the house down and make the night not a total disaster. i would recommend you don't watch the main event because Shane Douglas looked like he hasn't hit the gym since 2001 and he liked like he wasn't all the interested in having a match at all.,1376438400,,478,4.382022471910112
8554557,3,B00AN87CQE,"The opening tag team bout between The F.B.I.(Little Guido & Tony Mamaluke) against The B.W.O.(Stevie Richards & The Blue Meanie) was BORING!! The AL Snow-CW Anderson match was average but too long for it's own good. The Balls Mahoney-Axl Rotten match was a hardcore,smash-mouth brawl. The Devon Storm-Jerry Lynn match was a high-flying,hardcore,smash-mouth,high-spot-full show saver. The Shane Douglas-2 Cold Scorpio match was bad yet still entertaining but a poor finish to ruin it more. I give this super-card a 5 out of 10.",1361664000,,526,5.349397590361446
