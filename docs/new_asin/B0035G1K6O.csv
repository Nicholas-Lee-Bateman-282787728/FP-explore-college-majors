8389015,2,B0035G1K6O,"3 college kid movies that try to be funny, but don't quite make it. Freshman Orientation concerns a kid who can't get the girl, but finally succeeds by pretending to be gay. Foreign Exchange contains foreign stereotypes, the usual one. Who's your daddy is about a kid who suddenly inherits money he wasn't aware of and becomes an a-hole. Predictably he falls on hard times, his friends come to his aid and teach him life lessons. Lots of pretty girls, that's about it.",1441756800,2,468,4.650602409638554
