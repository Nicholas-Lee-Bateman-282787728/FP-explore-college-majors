7902994,4,B000003KB5,"This episode is very thought provoking in that it deals with a race encountered by the Voyager crew which supposedly evolved from dinosaurs and traveled thousands of light-years from Earth to the Delta quadrant.  A scientist from this very advanced species is trying to prove to his people what he calls the ""distant origin theory"" with the help of Chakotay.  His belief is rejected by his people and he is imprisoned along with the Voyager Crew, will they ever escape?",1020556800,2,469,4.85
7902995,3,B000003KB5,"In a Chakotay filled 45 minutes we learn that the second in command has been kidnapped by an alien scientist who wants to use Chakotay to prove his  theory about the origin of his species. You see this alien is a member of a  very proud race that believe it is the first being to be created on their  planet and that they are the most important creation in the Universe. But  this maverick scientist believes that their race, the Voth, originated on  Earth and that the human's onboard Voyager are his distant ancestors...  well apparently he was once a dinosaur so they must be VERY distant  ancestors.
This is a strange episode that explores the religion vs.  science war and that it is often best to lie to people then give them  groundbreaking news that they can't handle.",966816000,5,776,4.525179856115108
