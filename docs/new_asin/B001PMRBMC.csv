3748331,5,B001PMRBMC,"This show is wonderful, intelligent, honest, dark and soda out the nose hilarious. I fell in love with in the first 5 minutes. This is a great show if you are a woman who is looking for something that doesn't shove fairy tale BS and traditional gender roles down your throat. This is the exact opposite. The women are horrible, the men are horrible, EVERYONE is horrible and in the most amusing ways. For the sick and twisted woman in your life.",1252972800,12,445,4.439024390243903
3748332,5,B001PMRBMC,"This show isn't for everyone, no (what is?).  It is brilliant, yes.  But you might hate it - or, worse, just go ""meh"" - though probably only if you're expecting it to be something it isn't.  That's because its humor - like most humor - isn't for everyone.  But, rest assured, this means that if it does hit your funny bone, it *really* hits it, as it doesn't go for the broad ""everyman"" humor of sitcoms that is so depersonalized (and depersonalizing).  Which is frankly sort of a contradiction (or would be, if we weren't all weened on over-broad, over-safe comedy), as this show derives its humor from the absurdity of life in the reality we share.  That's where this show shines, by taking the everyday, the downright droll, and mining it for the humor that is there, that each of us goes through, but that we don't necessarily see the ""funny"" in just as a goldfish doesn't see the water, since, well, it's soaking in it.  Or rather, I presume that's the case, as I've never been a goldfish.  We're all soaking in the absurdity of life every single day, but Pulling gives us a new perspective, a distance, which allows us to see it for what it is.  So sure, in some ways there's darkness to it, but then that's true for life, isn't it?  However, to call this show 'dark' is sort of missing the point.  So is saying it's anti-this or the antidote-to-that.  Because here's what the show is: a unique creation, that stands on its own, and doesn't need to be held up to anything, compare or contrast.  Here's also what it is: a show that illustrates not the darkness of life, but rather the humor surrounding even dark things (or the no-things), that exists not only despite the everyday, but because of it.  The plot, the writing, the acting, the production - all of it succeeds where others have failed precisely because it is tone-perfect, note-perfect, reality-perfect, all by being true to itself.  And that seems to be one of the hardest things to achieve, as so few ever pull it off.  But Pulling does.  To brilliance.",1251331200,15,2024,4.53168044077135
3748333,2,B001PMRBMC,"This Britcom stars co-creator Sharon Horgan as a bored bride-to-be who dumps her dull fiance in the first episode (just before the wedding) and then finds dating with her cynical friends isn't such fun. It has a certain deadpan appeal, but too often that's crossed up by broad comedy, like having her fiance crawl to her weeping on his knees. Low-key or exaggerated: choose, people!

3748334,5,B001PMRBMC,"This comedy is hilarious.  Don't take my word for it.  Pulling Seasons 1 and 2 were nominated for BAFTA Awards.  The writing is killer, and the acting is fantastic.

It may not have the high (read: moneyed) production values of some of the more lavish American comedies (set in wealthy homes in New York and L.A.) - the world of Pulling is a gritty, realistic world - but this only adds to the brilliance of Pulling and the believability of the characters.  I was completely drawn into the drama of their lives, and found myself believing all of their ridiculous, self destructive antics, which is what made it so very, very funny.

Pulling is genius.  I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD.",1244246400,16,698,4.492063492063492
3748335,1,B001PMRBMC,"I purchased this DVD because of the hype, which made it sound like it was on par with the Office, Peep Show, etc.  I fell for the tag line that this show was nothing like Friends  I dislike Friends, predicable plots, one dimensional characters, and lame jokes that you can see coming from a mile away.

Take the three female characters from Friends, have them drink more, sleep around more, and throw up a lot, and you have Pulling.  Pulling has nothing in it that you haven't seen before on every single crap sitcom released in the last ten years.",1241913600,15,548,4.45
3748336,5,B001PMRBMC,"""Pulling"" is one of the funniest well written tv shows since ""The Sopranos"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Entourage"".  Why wouldn't anyone who enjoys bold, bawdy comedy want to watch a sitcom described as

""the dark side of Sex and The City"" and ""the sitcom for people who hated FRIENDs and everything it represented""

with characters described as

""sluttsh alcoholic schoolteacher karen""

and

""desperately man-hungry Louise""

Who plunge into the single girl's real world of public drunkeness, shameful promiscuity, crippling guilt and the tantalizing possibilites of new love.

A little raw in the language department, but I always felt I was in good company, even watching alone at home and wondering why I didn't have a date myself. Well, you won't feel alone when watching this oddball trio of single woman trying to figure out what's wrong with themselves, advising each other, getting into screwball situations, falling for the (definitely) wrong guys. This is what Sex and the City should have been. It's much funnier. If you like dry, Irish wit, you'll love this. Oh, and I'm male and I love the accent. Total sucker for it. Music to my ears.

3748354,4,B001PMRBMC,"It's NOT the ""inbetweeners"" (good, but very adolescent) or ""Peep Show"" (my fav) but it is of a similar genrenuanced and tongue in cheek, a low-key buffet of very empathetic and very flawed characters doing things we may see every day but done here in a way NEVER seen on TV... a great cast of REAL characters, living REAL lives.  I haven't been in the UK for quite a few years but this confirms my impression from earlier BritCom viewing that there is NO censorship on British TV (BRILLIANT!!!) The dialogue and situations induce the guilty pleasures and of this type of comic voyeurism... very blunt and harshand, very often, brutally sad and howlingly funnyjust like life.
The principal characters and the whole gang of secondary characters are definitely the great strength of this series.  It's hardly a beauty contest, by any means, but a real slice of life, ""warts and all"", that's most often entirely believable and grimace-inducingly funny (in the style of 'The Office"").
Would love to see more from these guys.",1403654400,2,1019,4.850574712643678

3748356,5,B001PMRBMC,"I bought this without any knowledge of what it would be about. I LOVE comedies involving women and so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I think it's similar to the HBO series ""Girls"", but funnier. The Brits come up with some funny stuff and usually more daring than the USA does. These ladies will crack you up. After season 1, season 2 is a must! The ONLY BAD thing is there is only 6 episodes per season. I didn't want these two seasons to end, but the Brits think it's better to give you quality entertainment rather than quantity that lacks luster with time. I personally wish someone in the USA could take-off on a series like this (like I said with Girls maybe) like the ""Office"" did and keep it going. Season 2 is just as funny and I'll bet you fall in love with these ladies just as I did. They're cute and crazy funny!",1395273600,,824,4.188679245283019
3748357,3,B001PMRBMC,"I liked this series in the first few episodes, but then the characters became people I no longer related to and I became disinterested. I did not finish the series. It is okay, just not for me.",1395100800,,193,4.243243243243243
3748358,5,B001PMRBMC,"This show is witty, clever, insightful, and above all HILARIOUS. You'll lough so hard you're bound to choke on something or pull a muscle, so be careful. If you're NOT accustomed to watching british TV, you might be having hard time understanding the language, but if you watched Shameless (uk version) IT crowd,  The Office and their likes and loved it, you are guaranteed to be hooked. That's not to say first timers  should  be discouraged.  Watch how Donna, the main character, breaks up with her Fiancee during episode 1. If you're in need of medical help at that moment it's a good sign.

The show follows the lives of 3 friends, all single women in their 30, as they bundle through life, career, dating, love and sex. Sounds a bit like ""Sex and the city"", right? Well, Wrong. This is not a show about Manolo shoes or glamorous parties. It's not about gloss and fashion and reading Cosmo, it's about being single and young and not knowing quite what to do with it, and making all the possible mistakes, with the most hilarious results. There's such raw, crazy thirst for life, love, sex and Booze. Oh, so much booze. and sex. and booze. And havoc.
Donna, Tanya and Louise are real, lovable and extremely funny. Though they are all flawed in their own way and super dysfunctional, you cannot help but falling in love with them and hope that somewhere there's a happily ever after for them.
Another big plus of watching this show is that you WILL NOT feel discouraged with your own love life/career/house/money/body after watching this. This is a feel good show! Comparing, Your life will seem great, your choices mature, your partner sensitive and supportive and your substance consumption tolerably moderate :)",1394582400,3,1716,4.764309764309765

3748363,5,B001PMRBMC,One of my all time favorite shows.
