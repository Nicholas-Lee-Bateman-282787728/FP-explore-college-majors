8548939,4,B00AA6AI6U,"Believe (hope I am wrong), Amazon will let me review only one. NO reviews of this yet. 150 + reviews of book (mostly 5 stars). So, this cries for review, even if less-informed than I would like. (Appreciated what I saw. Background info calls me to want to see the other stories.

When I saw book listed last night: immediately wrote about it to a friend. Such strong recommendation. (""Oh! Should send this is as review. No time today."" Now, with so many reviews - almost identical, I wanted to write about the audiobook, my favorite format - if unabridged & read by author).

Searching for audiobook; found this. (No Question: Will add it to my wish list by this weekend!) From info so far:These are all important stories that need to be told, with multiple lessons we can learn from each.

Letter to friend, recommending the book was based on compellingly-powerful memories from movie (decade ago): HTH. Letter was recap (w/o spoilers) of nearly dozen, vivid memories from movie - most from after her decision to graduate high school (and more).

Academically ""gifted"" - no question. And modest. (Curious how Harvard affected her - and she, Harvard.)

Audience without direct knowledge of gifted teens may walk away from HTH without apprecating how/why a brilliant woman made the decisions she did (and carried out those difficult deciions.) Not just the big one: all the daily ones, too.

Looking forward to the other stories as well, so giving a guarded 4-stars: To encoursge others to write additional reviews. When I have opportunity to see ""the set"" - I can add comments and, if appropriate, change the rating.

If Amazon also lets me write about *only* the first selection, I would share from the letter I wrote (ideally at the audible-book listing).

Suggest readers find more reviews of each of the stories included here. Or, if ticket-price is  not a concern: follow your instincts. If stories are as well-told as I expect, you will have ample opportunities to ""share your find"" - perhaps (then) write about what you see, learn, feel, know.",1358380800,2,2050,4.8342857142857145
