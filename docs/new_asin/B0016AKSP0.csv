3155502,5,B0016AKSP0,"I'm so glad this film became available on DVD.  Barbara Stanwyck is perfect as the spoiled daughter of TC Jeffords (Huston).  There's a lot going on, but the pace is leisurely enough that you have time to digest and enjoy every morsel.  The scenes between Stanwyck and Judith Anderson are terrific.  Oh, who am I kidding?  EVERY scene with Stanwyck is terrific!!",1239840000,3,362,4.774193548387097
3155503,5,B0016AKSP0,This is just one more reason why my favorite star of all time is Barbara Stanwyck.  There was no role she couldn't play and didn't try.  How she never won an oscar is a mystery to me.  She could play the meanest woman and still make you love her.  There was just something about her. The Furies is just one example of this.  Walter Houston is equally cast as her hard headed father.  All the supporting cast is top notch.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.  It's a great western and the battle between the two stars for control is great drama,1227139200,6,548,4.201923076923077
3155504,4,B0016AKSP0,"In one year, 1950, director Anthony Mann made four films: There was the crisp Farley Granger noir adventure ""Side Street"" plus three Westerns, including ""Devil's Doorway,"" the rousing classic ""Winchester '73"" and ""The Furies.""

That's how you hustle, and for any filmmaker that's a damn good year.

That last title, ""The Furies,"" refers to a sprawling southwestern ranch owned by the proud, controlling blowhard T.C. Jeffords (Walter Huston in his last role, one year after winning an Oscar for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre."").

During the course of the film, the main characters refer to the estate often but it is never called ""the ranch,"" ""the property"" or even ""our land.""

It's always called ""The Furies,"" and as if to underscore the self-consciousness of the conceit, most of the people who say it seem to be resisting the urge to lick their lips immediately afterward.

But the film's three principal characters tote their own serious grudges, so while it's a clumsy subtext, the title could also refer to these agents of vengeance. Bastards, the set of them, but in the end sympathetic as well.

Barbara Stanwyck stars as Jeffords' daughter Vance, whose devotion to her father is second only to her fondness for standing in boots and jeans with her gloved fists pressed defiantly into her hips. That stance is basically how she lives and she lives to work the ranch (er ... I mean, The Furies). Surely that's not too much to ask, is it?

My facetiousness aside, this is a wonderful and frequently astonishing film. I kid because the movie is a breathless mix of influences and high emotions -- there's Sophocles here, and a lot of King Lear and sundry other Shakespeare. It's also Wellesian -- the Jeffords could be southwestern cousins to the Ambersons. But there are also hints of ""Dallas"" and ""Falcon Crest,"" as well as other more serious but still-soapy fare in which doomed offspring stand beneath towering portraits of their parents.

Despite Mann's eventual seminal Westerns, however, ""The Furies"" seems more like Sam Fuller than, say, ""The Naked Spur"" or even ""Man of the West"" -- it has Fuller's grit and shrewdness and his tendency toward the baroque. That is, in part, because producer Hal Wallis didn't want to pay for Technicolor so -- highly unusual for a Western of this time -- he ordered the movie shot in black-and-white.

That decision absolutely sealed the film's greatness because Mann, with cinematographer Victor Milner, created a nightmarishly beautiful landscape as a backdrop. With some exceptions, the exteriors are largely shot day-for-night, even in cases where it's supposed to be daytime -- most of the scenes seem to exist in that alien space where the cattle drive began in ""Red River."" The sky is almost always stark and bleak and strewn with beautiful clouds and the desert is always somewhat shadowy and peopled with the silhouettes of riders. This lends the melodrama the air of isolation and purgatory; it transforms The Furies everyone wants so badly into a wasteland and makes ""The Furies"" something of a ghost story that is all the more unsettling because it's so lovely to look at.",1225584000,7,3132,4.93916349809886
3155505,4,B0016AKSP0,"There's a lot of Freudian subtext in this unusual 1950 Western, but what resonates most is how director Anthony Mann so smoothly transcends the testosterone-driven genre to come up with an entertaining hybrid of a woman's picture and a Greek tragedy. At the dynamic core of this film is the masterstroke of casting Walter Huston (in his last screen role) and Barbara Stanwyck as a spendthrift father and his headstrong daughter at odds over running the expansive ranch that gives the movie its name. In Roman mythology, the Furies were supernatural personifications of the anger of the dead. As females, they represent regeneration and the potency of creation, which both consumes and empowers. It is this single-minded sense of empowerment that drives Vance Jeffords to usurp her wily father T.C. while seeking his approval at the same time.

Set in 1870's New Mexico, the story written by Charles Schnee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-and-the-Beautiful/dp/B00005U2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad and the Beautiful</a>) is steeped in not-so-indiscreet psychological baggage. T.C. lives by his own rules by borrowing liberally from banks, paying hired hands with his own script, and allowing Mexican settlers to live off his land. Unlike her weak-willed brother, Vance enjoys provoking her father but to what end is never clear as an unacknowledged cloud of incest hangs over their strange relationship. At the same time, T.C. has a sworn enemy in gambler Rip Darrow who is looking to avenge his father's death at T.C.'s hands. Vance falls for Darrow, but she's also drawn to Juan Herrera, a childhood friend and one of the Mexicans now considered squatters. Complicating matters even more is the arrival of T.C.'s pretentious fiance Flo Burnett, a devious socialite out to rid the ranch of the Mexicans and push Vance aside as the female head of the beleaguered family. This ploy leads to a most shocking scene that fits well within the story's noirish shadings.

As T.C., Huston gives a grand performance evoking both the old prospector in his son John's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre/dp/B00003CXD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a>&nbsp;and the conflicted industrialist in William Wyler's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodsworth/dp/B00005PJ6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodsworth</a>. Although a bit old for her role at 43, Stanwyck combines her no-nonsense manner with a childlike vulnerability in illuminating Vance's most complex psyche. This is excellent work from an actress who always seemed home on the range. Generally a pliable third lead in films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window/dp/B001CC7PPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window</a>), Wendell Corey doesn't lend charisma or a convincing edge to his swagger as Darrow, but Gilbert Roland shines in the smallish role of Juan and strikes sparks with Stanwyck that should have happened with Corey. However, it is Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebecca/dp/B001D8W7EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rebecca</a>) who steals her brief scenes as Flo bringing out a palpable tension with Stanwyck in their almost-comically cutting scenes together (pardon the pun!). Veteran character actress Beulah Bondi also has a nice near-cameo as a banker's wife fully aware of her husband's prideful shortcomings.

The intensely passionate movie swirls in all its psycho-sexual emotionalism and Shakespearean-level acts of murder, revenge and greed, but oddly (and perhaps due to the edicts of studio censors), Mann applies the brakes in the disappointing final portion of the film. Still, it's well worth viewing in the new Criterion Collection's 2008 release chock-full of extras. First, there is the meticulously academic commentary track by Western scholar Jim Kitses (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horizons-West-Directing-the-Western-from-John-Ford-to-Clint-Eastwood/dp/1844570509/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horizons West: Directing the Western from John Ford to Clint Eastwood</a>). Then there is an interesting 17-minute interview with Mann (""Actions Speak Louder Than Words"") conducted just prior to his death in 1967. Another interview is offered with Mann's daughter Nina specifically for this release as she recalls her father's often underrated body of work. More of a curio is a silly, obviously scripted 1931 interview with Huston where he evasively responds to the vacuous questions of a pretty reporter. The original theatrical trailer and a stills gallery round out the extras.",1224892800,4,4810,6.374233128834356
3155506,3,B0016AKSP0,"This is an entertaining film and definitely contains some find elements, but it is far from the best work of any of the major participants and in the end isn't completely satisfying.  The movie is most famous for being the great Walter Huston's final film.  He in fact died very shortly after finishing work on the film and before its release.  Though not among his best films, it does feature many moments where he is able to chew up one scene after another.  And near the end of the film there is a steer-wrestling scene on which he appears to have done much of the stunt work, an astonishing feat for a man of 65.

I'm a huge fan of Barbara Stanwyck.  She is, in fact, my favorite actor, but I was very uncomfortable watching her in this one.  Much of my enjoyment of her in other films comes from the fact that she is by any standard a strong female at a time when women weren't always allowed to be so.  In this one, however, she not only has a bizarre attraction for a physically unattractive and personally unappealing gambler, she puts up with being slapped around and otherwise abused.  She is, however, even in this film remarkable.  Playing a character much younger than Stanwyck was at the time (she was 42 at the time of filming), her girlish build did not at all belie her age.  And this despite being in real life a heavy smoker.  Still, this is very far from being one of her best films or one of her more memorable performances.  Part of that, however, is a reflection on just how many superb performances she gave over the years.

This is also not one of director Anthony Mann's best films.  1950 saw the release of the first of his significant Westerns, WINCHESTER 73.  Over the next decade he would establish himself, along with John Ford, as the premiere maker of classic Westerns, directing such films as BEND IN THE RIVER, THE NAKED SPUR, THE FAR COUNTRY, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, and THE TIN STAR, most of these starring his WINCHESTER 73 star Jimmy Stewart.  THE FURIES fall far below any of those movies, or even lesser Westerns like MAN OF THE WEST.  Still, the movie is interesting as an early effort by one of the masters of the Western genre.

The title of the film refers on one level to the ranch that Huston's character owns, but also the Greek myths concerning the three goddesses of vengeance.  They were especially concerned with avenging injustice.  Going into the film I assumed that three women would play some role in wrecking vengeance on T. C. Jeffords.  Stanwyck's Vance Jeffords was one obvious candidate.  Judith Anderson's Flo was the second.  Blanche Yurka, as the mother of Juan Herrera, hung by T. C. Jeffords, avenges the death of her son as the third fury.

All in all, I was not impressed with this film.  As I stated at the beginning of my review, Mann, Stanwyck, and Huston all did much better work than this.  I'll probably never rewatch this movie though I've already seen films like Mann's THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, Stanwyck's DOUBLE INDEMNITY and THE LADY EVE, and Huston's DODSWORTH and THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE multiple times.",1219190400,3,3106,4.539568345323741
3155507,5,B0016AKSP0,"Director Anthony Mann made the important transition from film noir B movies to westerns in 1950 with three films:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winchester-73/dp/B00005JLV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winchester '73</a>, Devil's Doorway, and The Furies. The last film was an ambitious big budget mix of western and women's melodrama with a fascinating dash of psychological subtext. At its heart is a startlingly complex performance from Barbara Stanwyck.

While The Furies has all the iconography of a western, it more resembles a psychological drama and as such, it is quite an achievement that Mann was able to make it within the Hollywood studio system.

There is an audio commentary by film historian Jim Kitses. He talks about how the film evokes a blend of gothic romance, film noir and the western. He makes a convincing case for Anthony Mann as an auteur and how his thematic preoccupations elevate this film above genre conventions. Kitses expertly analyzes the director's style and how it informs the characters and their motivations. This is a solid, informative track.

""Action Speaks Louder Than Words"" is an excerpt from a 1967 interview with Mann for British television. He talks about his beginnings in the theatre and how he broke into the film business. Mann also talks about some of the filmmakers that influenced him in this excellent interview.

""Intimate Interviews: Walter Huston"" is a rare interview with the veteran actor who comes across as a larger than life figure as was his reputation. It is a playful yet odd interview as he gives little away.

""Nina Mann Interview"" features the actress and daughter of Anthony Mann as she talks about her father and his films, in particular, The Furies. She points out that he refused to have stereotypical heroes and villains in his films and this was readily evident in this film.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

There is a Stills Gallery with a nice collection of behind-the-scenes photographs of the cast and crew at work.

Finally, in a nice touch, Niven Busch's source novel is included which is a wonderful extra the Criterion Collection has done in the past (i.e.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Fell-to-Earth-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000A88EVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Fell to Earth - Criterion Collection</a>) and hopefully one that they will continue in the future.",1215388800,17,2464,5.658536585365853
3155508,5,B0016AKSP0,"Anthony Mann's marvelous noir Western gets the usual deluxe Criterion treatment here, with a flawless transfer, excellent commentary from Mann scholar Jim Kitses, and the icing on this package's cake, a reprint of the hard-to-find Niven Busch novel that serves as the film's basis.  Like Busch's other Freud-on-the-range epic, DUEL IN THE SUN, THE FURIES hardly lacks traditional action set pieces, but places its emphasis on the tortured pscyhes and twisted relationships of its main characters.  Stanwyck's perhaps a bit long in the tooth for the story's Electra figure, but her performance is full-blooded and richly enjoyable.  She's a fine match for Walter Huston's inspired scenery chewing as patriarch T.C. Jeffords.  Wendell Corey, the lacklustre romantic lead, was in the middle of proving to producer Hal Wallis why he'd never be a major star; he's solid and intelligent, but his meant-to-sizzle pairing with Stanwyck suggests a Greenwich accountant trying to explain a particularly thorny tax problem to an uncomprehending client.  Not to worry, though.  Barbara's scenes with childhood pal Gilbert Roland and (yes!) father Huston have enough erotic subtext for ten films.  Throw in Mann's usual great eye for spatial relationships (the compositions on display here could tell the picture's story without words), crisp dialogue in Charles Schnee's sharp screenplay, fine supporting performances from Judith Anderson, Thomas Gomez, and Blanche Yurka (who seems to be sporting Katina Paxinou's old hair), and you've got a classic film ripe for rediscovery.  Grab this one.",1215129600,4,1581,5.5041322314049586
3155509,4,B0016AKSP0,"This is a really entertaining film, despite the fact that Leonard Maltin only rates it two and one-half stars. The acting and cinematography are excellent. Maltin finds it talky, but I can't entirely agree. It's actually a paraphrase of the O'Neill drama Mourning Becomes Electra. The supplementary material included is good.",1215043200,9,325,5.392156862745098
3155510,5,B0016AKSP0,"This is a great ""noir western"" starring Barbara Stanwyck, whose name is synonoymous with Westerns and Noirs. The underlying  theme and truths of Father- Daughter  love and hate, with the need and love of land and family legacy. Here Stanwyck is Vance Jeffords, the only person who can run and manage the ""Furies"", thousands of acres of ranch and cattle, besides  her father. Torn between love for Rip Darrow, an enemy of her father's, as well as Juanito, a Mexican squatter and one at war with her father.
The pairing of Wendell Corey (Rip) and Stanwyck takes a little getting used  to. They were much better matched in the File on Thelma Jordan. Their romance is challenged by her devotion to and later on hate for her father, played by the great Walter Huston in his last movie.
When Stanwyck received the AFI's lifetime achievement award in 1987, John Huston saluted her with the words his father said after the movie rapped.
""I just made a great film with a great and wonderful actress and lady""; referring to Stanwyck.
This movie was not well received when it was first released due to the times (1950) when people were not about to accept a tough and mannish woman (aptly named Vance) having  difficult times with her father, as well as two romances; one with a Mexican and she kisses him on the mouth!!
This movie has been re-digitalized  and I can say as one who had taped it years ago on AMC, this is a fine and clean print. The original book by Niven Busch is added, Also Criterion always has extra adds on the DVD that are worth seeing. You will not forget this movie anytime soon and know why it is becoming a
cult fav.",1214611200,11,1631,4.493243243243243
3155511,5,B0016AKSP0,"This film about the feud between a megalomaniac rancher T.C. Jeffords(Walter Huston) and his daughter Vance (Barbara Stanwyck) is an unusual but excellent western. Jeffords and his daughter have a complex relationship with even a hint of the sordid that had to remain unstated in 1950, when this film was made. In middle age T.C. takes a wife, Flo (Judith Anderson). Vance sees Flo as a threat to her relationship with Daddy, and in an angry moment hurls a pair of scissors at Flo's face. In revenge T.C. kills someone who means a great deal to his daughter, the squatter Herrara (Gilbert Roland).

From this moment forward the battle between father and daughter shifts from being one of violence to one of wits. Wendell Corey plays Rip Darrow, Stanwyck's love interest in this film. He quickly finds that as long as Daddy is alive that he will always come in second. Daddy has ownership of all of the emotions Vance has to give - both love and hate.

This film is basically a film noir played out on a Western landscape. It is often ""Mourning Becomes Electra"" from the father/daughter angle versus mother and son. Directed by Anthony Mann, maker of the thinking person's Westerns, it is a shame that Walter Huston did not live to see the release of this - his final film - in which he gives so great a performance.

New, restored high-definition digital transfer

3155525,3,B0016AKSP0,"An obscure Anthony Mann western -- deservedly!

There's a strong sense of stage play here cuz the family conflicts formed the centerpiece of the film. That's not a bad thing -- many westerns were about dysfunctional families.

Financial dealings replaced most (but not all) the gunplay. That's not a bad thing either. The west needn't be just about honorable vengeance (but that does play a major role here, too).

Like many films of the pre-womens-lib era, the women dominate -- sometimes in-your-face, as Barbara Stanwyck's character does -- or more subtly, as Judith Anderson's and Beulah Bondi's characters. In fact, the best stand-off scenes occur between Stanwyck and Anderson. Wonderful performances from these women.

Those were my favorite elements of the film.

My first gripe is that the story took too long to get going -- altho, once it did, it moved at a good clip.

The male side paled next to female side. Wendall Corey did well in a well-written role -- but he lacked screen charisma. Gilbert Roland's character was totally emasculated. Walter Huston's character would have been fun but his top-of-his-lungs acting ruined the first part of the film for me. As his role diminished, he became more tolerable.

Even in the Criterion version, it was an ugly film to look at with quite a bit of day-for-night. And the metaphor-rich dialog was hard going.

3155528,4,B0016AKSP0,"Anthony Mann desperately wanted in his directing career to make a Western version of KING LEAR; though he  succeeded at the end of his Fifties with his film MAN ON THE WEST, his yearnings in a Shakespearean direction produced some other memorable Westerns, including this remarkable blend of Jacobean and Greek tragedies set in New Mexico in the late nineteenth century. In his vision of an egomaniacal land baron named T. C. Jeffords (Walter Huston) who becomes far too close to his spoiled adult daughter Vance (Barbara Stanwyck) and then invites tragedy by bringing a widow (Judith Anderson) home as his new fiancee, Mann brings a vision of the West unlike almost anything else Hollywood had seen... except, perhaps, in JOHNNY GUITAR.

Here, as in the Nicholas Ray film, all the power is in the hands of the women, despite the film's celebration of T. C.'s legend, and the title refers not simply to the name of T. C.'s giant ranch (and is such a strange name for it that the screenwriters refer to it in practically every other line of dialogue so we can get used to it) but also to the four ""queens"" who dominate the picture and who leave their mark on T. C. and eventually destroy him: Stanwyck as a hyperaggressive queen of clubs who fights with him; Anderson as a smooth-as-silk queen of hearts who wins his affections (temporarily); Beulah Bondi as a wealthy San Franciscan banker's wife who, as the queen of diamonds, figures prominently into the financial dealings that drive the film's plot near the end; and Blanche Yurka, over-the-top as ""The Witch Herrera,"" the matriarch of a Mexican family accused of squatting on The Furies who is both queen of spades and a deadshot, cackling maniacally when she fires at her enemies.

All this may sound a little much, and it's perhaps not as smoothly brought together as one might like. But the cinematography is fantastic (making frequent use of day-for-night shots), and the acting is of as high quality as you might ever expect in a Western. (Only Wendell Corey, as Stanwyck's scheming suitor who loathes her father, is a disappointment; though his performance is fine, he looks like a ventriloquist's dummy, and seems miscast for someone whom Stanwyck keeps speaking of as an Adonis of the Prairie.) The casting of Judith Anderson to play the crucial part of Flo, Vance's rival for T.C.'s attentions, was particularly brilliant: Anderson was celebrated for her stage portrayals of Greek tragedy queens, and only she, perhaps, could have seemed a fit nemesis for Stanwyck (who winds up mutilating her stepmother-to-be with a pair of scissors). The dialogue is meant to be clever, and sometimes is, and sometimes seems overripe. The film's greatest flaw is its softened ending, which veers away from the full Jacobean chaos it seems to promise earlier.",1268438400,4,2808,4.894957983193278

3155530,4,B0016AKSP0,"Anthony Mann cut his teeth in movies directing some of the best ""film noir"" the genre had to offer.
Movies like T-MEN, RAW DEAL, SIDE STREET and DESPERATE showed his strengths in composition, cinematography and gritty realism in his storytelling (if at times a little uneven). However...Mann really hit his stride when he began directing the ""western"". Here Mann is in his element.

1950 was the year that made Anthony Mann a directing icon.  Filmed before 1950's WINCHESTER 73, yet released after is THE FURIES (1950) This is a deliciously demented mixture of film noir and classic western elements.

Walter Huston plays T.C Jeffords, the widowed, ruthless, cold blooded, yet charismatic cattle baron. Barbara Stanwyck plays Hustons spoiled, headstrong tomboy daughter Vance Jeffords. While he has a son (played by John Bromfield) Huston has chosen Stanwyck to be the eventual ruler of his empire once he has retired. However...after being away on a long trip, Huston returns with a new love interest, the more ""society friendly"" Flo (played with great complexity by Judith Anderson)

Flo and Vance butt heads and when it is clear that she is jockeying for control of the ranch and trying to edge out Vance, Stanwyck reacts with a disturbing act of violence that has horrific results. Stanwyck flees the ranch and takes refuge with her long time friend played by Gilbert Roland. Roland is a squatter on Hustons land and in retaliation, Huston reacts with an act of violence of his own to spite Stanwyck.

In the aftermath, Stanwyck spits out the most memorable line of the movie at Huston

""now I hate you in a way I didn't believe a human could hate. Take a good long look at me T.C. You won't see me again until the day I take your world away from you!""

And thus begins an epic clash between father and daughter.

As with all of the Mann westerns, the terrain figures prominently in THE FURIES just as much as in Winchester 73, The Man From Laramie and Man Of The West. Unlike Ford, who emphasized and incorporated the beautiful vistas and sweeping grandeur of the southwest, Mann goes for something different. Mann sets his stage in desolate, remote, dangerously rocky hills. He goes for an almost claustrophobic feel. Bullets richochet off boulders, horse and riders struggle on unsure, gravely ground and rocks and boulders tumble dangerously down hillsides.
In a Mann western, the terrain is just as dangerous and deadly an opponent as any black hat wearing villain.

The film also has a memorable performance by Wendell Corey as a gambling house owner whose father was cheated out of his land by Huston, and who may or may not be an ally of Stanwyck. Also of note is Thomas Gomez as Hustons gleefully evil henchman ""El Tigre"".

It's logical that THE FURIES and Winchester 73 would incorporate a lot of noir style in them as that was Mann's forte prior. But THE FURIES mixes the two genres to the best effect I think. It has possibly some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a B&W western, Red River and Winchester 73 being the possible exceptions.

Again, like most Mann westerns, there is a ""King Lear"" style father figure in Huston. Stanwyck has a wonderful and demented strength and stands toe to toe with the imposing, wiley Huston all the way through. Corey is smartly understated next to these two titans. An excellent film, a great western and on my own personal top 20 greatest movies list.
I suggest getting the Criterion dvd of the movie. It has a great commentary that analyzes practically every frame of the film, an entertaining, fact filled booklet with interesting analysis of the film as well as an unpublished interview with Mann. There is a 1930s era interview with Huston at his home. The set also comes with a new printing of the Niven Busch novel on which the film is based. It is shown in its original aspect ratio.

Mann has always seemed to me to be the bridge between Fords more traditional vision of the west and the bleak, amoral, bloody violence of Peckinpaw. There would be no Peckinpaw without Mann, but there would be no classic Mann westerns without Ford. While The Furies is not as entertaining as the collaborations between Mann and Stewart, it is one heck of a ride and definately worth buying just to see the excellent treatment that Criterion gives this, until now, rarely seen little gem.",1241913600,7,4344,4.761968085106383
3155531,3,B0016AKSP0,"Compared to Anthony Mann's other Westerns, The Furies is certainly something of a disappointment. Released between his first, Winchester `73, and his darkest, Devil's Doorway, of Mann's Westerns, alongside Cimarron, it's easily the weakest. Both are at times more women's pictures set on the range than westerns and both only really work effectively for half their running time - Cimarron for the first half and The Furies in its second once the rather heavy-handed scene-setting is out of the way and the real power struggle begins.

Walter Huston's the cantankerous cattle baron building an empire as much on bank loans and IOUs as old-fashioned range wars. Used to having his own way in his kingdom - he even has his own worthless currency, `T.C.s' - he finds himself going all King Lear on his tomboyish daughter and heir apparent Barbara Stanwyck when she chooses the wrong man (and promptly easily buys him off). Things only get worse for her when she's usurped in her father's affections by Judith Anderson's society lady of a certain age and the scissors come out - literally - and Huston takes out his fury on Stanwyck's childhood friend with the aid of Thomas Gomez' rope-happy foreman. Yet it while it does improve in the last third as the blood starts to flow, it's never as engaging as it could be.

Part soap opera, part Greek tragedy, part stock market drama (it's stocks, a bear raid on the ranch's shares and bank manipulation that are her chosen weapons), it often feels like the film's being pulled in too many different directions to be wholly satisfying, never finding a really cohesive tone. It's almost as if the film has been carved up between the director, actors and producer, each getting their moment to dominate the film but sporadically giving the impression they're all making very different films. Mann's trademarks are visible, from the sadism of one female character being disfigured to one of his beloved mountaintop shootouts (for once not the climax of the film), but his customary visual sense and style simply isn't for all but a few fleeting moments here. It often feels more like an underbudgeted independent picture than a major studio one, with Victor Milner's Oscar-nominated cinematography less than successful whenever the film ventures outdoors: certainly there's nothing to match the adventurousness of Mann's collaborations with the great John Alton. Nor is he able to rise to the material as well as in his later films: he managed the dynastic infighting much more successfully in The Man From Laramie, El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire.

Worse, for a film that revolves around the land, for all the talk about their right to inherit it, the cast are rarely convincingly of the land. Only Huston and Gilbert Roland's squatter really seem at home here: everyone else seems like a visitor from the East. It's not helped by some weak casting - particularly Wendell Corey's dull romantic lead who's about as dangerous as an assistant manager in a shoe shop and John Bromford as her brother.

It's not all bad: Judith Anderson has one wonderful scene telling her new husband why she won't lend him any more money - the only security and assurance a woman in her circumstances can have - there's a powerful lynching scene and you do get to see Huston wrestling a bull in his last film, but it works more in fits and starts than in its entirety. Still, at least Criterion's DVD is impressive, with a 1967 interview with Mann carried over from their El Cid laserdisc, trailer and stills gallery, an at times over-academic audio commentary and a copy of Niven Busch's original novel for good measure.",1241654400,,3647,4.858520900321543
3389999,5,B0016AKSP0,"I'm so glad this film became available on DVD.  Barbara Stanwyck is perfect as the spoiled daughter of TC Jeffords (Huston).

Walter Houston is equally cast as her hard headed father.  All the supporting cast is top notch.  Do yourself a favor and buy this movie.  It's a great western and the battle between the two stars for control is great drama,1227139200,6,548,4.201923076923077
3390001,4,B0016AKSP0,"In one year, 1950, director Anthony Mann made four films: There was the crisp Farley Granger noir adventure ""Side Street"" plus three Westerns, including ""Devil's Doorway,"" the rousing classic ""Winchester '73"" and ""The Furies.""

That's how you hustle, and for any filmmaker that's a damn good year.

That last title, ""The Furies,"" refers to a sprawling southwestern ranch owned by the proud, controlling blowhard T.C. Jeffords (Walter Huston in his last role, one year after winning an Oscar for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre."").

During the course of the film, the main characters refer to the estate often but it is never called ""the ranch,"" ""the property"" or even ""our land.""

It's always called ""The Furies,"" and as if to underscore the self-consciousness of the conceit, most of the people who say it seem to be resisting the urge to lick their lips immediately afterward.

But the film's three principal characters tote their own serious grudges, so while it's a clumsy subtext, the title could also refer to these agents of vengeance. Bastards, the set of them, but in the end sympathetic as well.

Barbara Stanwyck stars as Jeffords' daughter Vance, whose devotion to her father is second only to her fondness for standing in boots and jeans with her gloved fists pressed defiantly into her hips. That stance is basically how she lives and she lives to work the ranch (er ... I mean, The Furies). Surely that's not too much to ask, is it?

My facetiousness aside, this is a wonderful and frequently astonishing film. I kid because the movie is a breathless mix of influences and high emotions -- there's Sophocles here, and a lot of King Lear and sundry other Shakespeare. It's also Wellesian -- the Jeffords could be southwestern cousins to the Ambersons. But there are also hints of ""Dallas"" and ""Falcon Crest,"" as well as other more serious but still-soapy fare in which doomed offspring stand beneath towering portraits of their parents.

Despite Mann's eventual seminal Westerns, however, ""The Furies"" seems more like Sam Fuller than, say, ""The Naked Spur"" or even ""Man of the West"" -- it has Fuller's grit and shrewdness and his tendency toward the baroque. That is, in part, because producer Hal Wallis didn't want to pay for Technicolor so -- highly unusual for a Western of this time -- he ordered the movie shot in black-and-white.

That decision absolutely sealed the film's greatness because Mann, with cinematographer Victor Milner, created a nightmarishly beautiful landscape as a backdrop. With some exceptions, the exteriors are largely shot day-for-night, even in cases where it's supposed to be daytime -- most of the scenes seem to exist in that alien space where the cattle drive began in ""Red River."" The sky is almost always stark and bleak and strewn with beautiful clouds and the desert is always somewhat shadowy and peopled with the silhouettes of riders. This lends the melodrama the air of isolation and purgatory; it transforms The Furies everyone wants so badly into a wasteland and makes ""The Furies"" something of a ghost story that is all the more unsettling because it's so lovely to look at.",1225584000,7,3132,4.93916349809886
3390002,4,B0016AKSP0,"There's a lot of Freudian subtext in this unusual 1950 Western, but what resonates most is how director Anthony Mann so smoothly transcends the testosterone-driven genre to come up with an entertaining hybrid of a woman's picture and a Greek tragedy. At the dynamic core of this film is the masterstroke of casting Walter Huston (in his last screen role) and Barbara Stanwyck as a spendthrift father and his headstrong daughter at odds over running the expansive ranch that gives the movie its name. In Roman mythology, the Furies were supernatural personifications of the anger of the dead. As females, they represent regeneration and the potency of creation, which both consumes and empowers. It is this single-minded sense of empowerment that drives Vance Jeffords to usurp her wily father T.C. while seeking his approval at the same time.

Set in 1870's New Mexico, the story written by Charles Schnee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-and-the-Beautiful/dp/B00005U2KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad and the Beautiful</a>) is steeped in not-so-indiscreet psychological baggage. T.C. lives by his own rules by borrowing liberally from banks, paying hired hands with his own script, and allowing Mexican settlers to live off his land. Unlike her weak-willed brother, Vance enjoys provoking her father but to what end is never clear as an unacknowledged cloud of incest hangs over their strange relationship. At the same time, T.C. has a sworn enemy in gambler Rip Darrow who is looking to avenge his father's death at T.C.'s hands. Vance falls for Darrow, but she's also drawn to Juan Herrera, a childhood friend and one of the Mexicans now considered squatters. Complicating matters even more is the arrival of T.C.'s pretentious fiance Flo Burnett, a devious socialite out to rid the ranch of the Mexicans and push Vance aside as the female head of the beleaguered family. This ploy leads to a most shocking scene that fits well within the story's noirish shadings.

As T.C., Huston gives a grand performance evoking both the old prospector in his son John's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Treasure-of-the-Sierra-Madre/dp/B00003CXD5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a>&nbsp;and the conflicted industrialist in William Wyler's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodsworth/dp/B00005PJ6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodsworth</a>. Although a bit old for her role at 43, Stanwyck combines her no-nonsense manner with a childlike vulnerability in illuminating Vance's most complex psyche. This is excellent work from an actress who always seemed home on the range. Generally a pliable third lead in films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rear-Window/dp/B001CC7PPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rear Window</a>), Wendell Corey doesn't lend charisma or a convincing edge to his swagger as Darrow, but Gilbert Roland shines in the smallish role of Juan and strikes sparks with Stanwyck that should have happened with Corey. However, it is Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rebecca/dp/B001D8W7EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rebecca</a>) who steals her brief scenes as Flo bringing out a palpable tension with Stanwyck in their almost-comically cutting scenes together (pardon the pun!). Veteran character actress Beulah Bondi also has a nice near-cameo as a banker's wife fully aware of her husband's prideful shortcomings.

The intensely passionate movie swirls in all its psycho-sexual emotionalism and Shakespearean-level acts of murder, revenge and greed, but oddly (and perhaps due to the edicts of studio censors), Mann applies the brakes in the disappointing final portion of the film. Still, it's well worth viewing in the new Criterion Collection's 2008 release chock-full of extras. First, there is the meticulously academic commentary track by Western scholar Jim Kitses (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horizons-West-Directing-the-Western-from-John-Ford-to-Clint-Eastwood/dp/1844570509/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horizons West: Directing the Western from John Ford to Clint Eastwood</a>). Then there is an interesting 17-minute interview with Mann (""Actions Speak Louder Than Words"") conducted just prior to his death in 1967. Another interview is offered with Mann's daughter Nina specifically for this release as she recalls her father's often underrated body of work. More of a curio is a silly, obviously scripted 1931 interview with Huston where he evasively responds to the vacuous questions of a pretty reporter. The original theatrical trailer and a stills gallery round out the extras.",1224892800,4,4810,6.374233128834356
3390003,3,B0016AKSP0,"This is an entertaining film and definitely contains some find elements, but it is far from the best work of any of the major participants and in the end isn't completely satisfying.  The movie is most famous for being the great Walter Huston's final film.  He in fact died very shortly after finishing work on the film and before its release.  Though not among his best films, it does feature many moments where he is able to chew up one scene after another.  And near the end of the film there is a steer-wrestling scene on which he appears to have done much of the stunt work, an astonishing feat for a man of 65.

I'm a huge fan of Barbara Stanwyck.  She is, in fact, my favorite actor, but I was very uncomfortable watching her in this one.  Much of my enjoyment of her in other films comes from the fact that she is by any standard a strong female at a time when women weren't always allowed to be so.  In this one, however, she not only has a bizarre attraction for a physically unattractive and personally unappealing gambler, she puts up with being slapped around and otherwise abused.  She is, however, even in this film remarkable.  Playing a character much younger than Stanwyck was at the time (she was 42 at the time of filming), her girlish build did not at all belie her age.  And this despite being in real life a heavy smoker.  Still, this is very far from being one of her best films or one of her more memorable performances.  Part of that, however, is a reflection on just how many superb performances she gave over the years.

This is also not one of director Anthony Mann's best films.  1950 saw the release of the first of his significant Westerns, WINCHESTER 73.  Over the next decade he would establish himself, along with John Ford, as the premiere maker of classic Westerns, directing such films as BEND IN THE RIVER, THE NAKED SPUR, THE FAR COUNTRY, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, and THE TIN STAR, most of these starring his WINCHESTER 73 star Jimmy Stewart.  THE FURIES fall far below any of those movies, or even lesser Westerns like MAN OF THE WEST.  Still, the movie is interesting as an early effort by one of the masters of the Western genre.

The title of the film refers on one level to the ranch that Huston's character owns, but also the Greek myths concerning the three goddesses of vengeance.  They were especially concerned with avenging injustice.  Going into the film I assumed that three women would play some role in wrecking vengeance on T. C. Jeffords.  Stanwyck's Vance Jeffords was one obvious candidate.  Judith Anderson's Flo was the second.  Blanche Yurka, as the mother of Juan Herrera, hung by T. C. Jeffords, avenges the death of her son as the third fury.

All in all, I was not impressed with this film.  As I stated at the beginning of my review, Mann, Stanwyck, and Huston all did much better work than this.  I'll probably never rewatch this movie though I've already seen films like Mann's THE NAKED SPUR and THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, Stanwyck's DOUBLE INDEMNITY and THE LADY EVE, and Huston's DODSWORTH and THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE multiple times.",1219190400,3,3106,4.539568345323741
3390004,5,B0016AKSP0,"Director Anthony Mann made the important transition from film noir B movies to westerns in 1950 with three films:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winchester-73/dp/B00005JLV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winchester '73</a>, Devil's Doorway, and The Furies. The last film was an ambitious big budget mix of western and women's melodrama with a fascinating dash of psychological subtext. At its heart is a startlingly complex performance from Barbara Stanwyck.

While The Furies has all the iconography of a western, it more resembles a psychological drama and as such, it is quite an achievement that Mann was able to make it within the Hollywood studio system.

There is an audio commentary by film historian Jim Kitses. He talks about how the film evokes a blend of gothic romance, film noir and the western. He makes a convincing case for Anthony Mann as an auteur and how his thematic preoccupations elevate this film above genre conventions. Kitses expertly analyzes the director's style and how it informs the characters and their motivations. This is a solid, informative track.

""Action Speaks Louder Than Words"" is an excerpt from a 1967 interview with Mann for British television. He talks about his beginnings in the theatre and how he broke into the film business. Mann also talks about some of the filmmakers that influenced him in this excellent interview.

""Intimate Interviews: Walter Huston"" is a rare interview with the veteran actor who comes across as a larger than life figure as was his reputation. It is a playful yet odd interview as he gives little away.

""Nina Mann Interview"" features the actress and daughter of Anthony Mann as she talks about her father and his films, in particular, The Furies. She points out that he refused to have stereotypical heroes and villains in his films and this was readily evident in this film.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

There is a Stills Gallery with a nice collection of behind-the-scenes photographs of the cast and crew at work.

3390005,5,B0016AKSP0,"Anthony Mann's marvelous noir Western gets the usual deluxe Criterion treatment here, with a flawless transfer, excellent commentary from Mann scholar Jim Kitses, and the icing on this package's cake, a reprint of the hard-to-find Niven Busch novel that serves as the film's basis.  Like Busch's other Freud-on-the-range epic, DUEL IN THE SUN, THE FURIES hardly lacks traditional action set pieces, but places its emphasis on the tortured pscyhes and twisted relationships of its main characters.  Stanwyck's perhaps a bit long in the tooth for the story's Electra figure, but her performance is full-blooded and richly enjoyable.  She's a fine match for Walter Huston's inspired scenery chewing as patriarch T.C. Jeffords.  Wendell Corey, the lacklustre romantic lead, was in the middle of proving to producer Hal Wallis why he'd never be a major star; he's solid and intelligent, but his meant-to-sizzle pairing with Stanwyck suggests a Greenwich accountant trying to explain a particularly thorny tax problem to an uncomprehending client.  Not to worry, though.  Barbara's scenes with childhood pal Gilbert Roland and (yes!) father Huston have enough erotic subtext for ten films.  Throw in Mann's usual great eye for spatial relationships (the compositions on display here could tell the picture's story without words), crisp dialogue in Charles Schnee's sharp screenplay, fine supporting performances from Judith Anderson, Thomas Gomez, and Blanche Yurka (who seems to be sporting Katina Paxinou's old hair), and you've got a classic film ripe for rediscovery.

Here Stanwyck is Vance Jeffords, the only person who can run and manage the ""Furies"", thousands of acres of ranch and cattle, besides  her father. Torn between love for Rip Darrow, an enemy of her father's, as well as Juanito, a Mexican squatter and one at war with her father.
The pairing of Wendell Corey (Rip) and Stanwyck takes a little getting used  to. They were much better matched in the File on Thelma Jordan. Their romance is challenged by her devotion to and later on hate for her father, played by the great Walter Huston in his last movie.
When Stanwyck received the AFI's lifetime achievement award in 1987, John Huston saluted her with the words his father said after the movie rapped.
""I just made a great film with a great and wonderful actress and lady""; referring to Stanwyck.

3390008,5,B0016AKSP0,"This film about the feud between a megalomaniac rancher T.C. Jeffords(Walter Huston) and his daughter Vance (Barbara Stanwyck) is an unusual but excellent western. Jeffords and his daughter have a complex relationship with even a hint of the sordid that had to remain unstated in 1950, when this film was made. In middle age T.C. takes a wife, Flo (Judith Anderson). Vance sees Flo as a threat to her relationship with Daddy, and in an angry moment hurls a pair of scissors at Flo's face. In revenge T.C. kills someone who means a great deal to his daughter, the squatter Herrara (Gilbert Roland).

From this moment forward the battle between father and daughter shifts from being one of violence to one of wits. Wendell Corey plays Rip Darrow, Stanwyck's love interest in this film. He quickly finds that as long as Daddy is alive that he will always come in second. Daddy has ownership of all of the emotions Vance has to give - both love and hate.

This film is basically a film noir played out on a Western landscape. It is often ""Mourning Becomes Electra"" from the father/daughter angle versus mother and son. Directed by Anthony Mann, maker of the thinking person's Westerns, it is a shame that Walter Huston did not live to see the release of this - his final film - in which he gives so great a performance.

There's a strong sense of stage play here cuz the family conflicts formed the centerpiece of the film. That's not a bad thing -- many westerns were about dysfunctional families.

Financial dealings replaced most (but not all) the gunplay. That's not a bad thing either. The west needn't be just about honorable vengeance (but that does play a major role here, too).

Like many films of the pre-womens-lib era, the women dominate -- sometimes in-your-face, as Barbara Stanwyck's character does -- or more subtly, as Judith Anderson's and Beulah Bondi's characters. In fact, the best stand-off scenes occur between Stanwyck and Anderson. Wonderful performances from these women.

Those were my favorite elements of the film.

My first gripe is that the story took too long to get going -- altho, once it did, it moved at a good clip.

The male side paled next to female side. Wendall Corey did well in a well-written role -- but he lacked screen charisma. Gilbert Roland's character was totally emasculated. Walter Huston's character would have been fun but his top-of-his-lungs acting ruined the first part of the film for me. As his role diminished, he became more tolerable.

Even in the Criterion version, it was an ugly film to look at with quite a bit of day-for-night. And the metaphor-rich dialog was hard going.

3390025,4,B0016AKSP0,"Anthony Mann desperately wanted in his directing career to make a Western version of KING LEAR; though he  succeeded at the end of his Fifties with his film MAN ON THE WEST, his yearnings in a Shakespearean direction produced some other memorable Westerns, including this remarkable blend of Jacobean and Greek tragedies set in New Mexico in the late nineteenth century. In his vision of an egomaniacal land baron named T. C. Jeffords (Walter Huston) who becomes far too close to his spoiled adult daughter Vance (Barbara Stanwyck) and then invites tragedy by bringing a widow (Judith Anderson) home as his new fiancee, Mann brings a vision of the West unlike almost anything else Hollywood had seen... except, perhaps, in JOHNNY GUITAR.

Here, as in the Nicholas Ray film, all the power is in the hands of the women, despite the film's celebration of T. C.'s legend, and the title refers not simply to the name of T. C.'s giant ranch (and is such a strange name for it that the screenwriters refer to it in practically every other line of dialogue so we can get used to it) but also to the four ""queens"" who dominate the picture and who leave their mark on T. C. and eventually destroy him: Stanwyck as a hyperaggressive queen of clubs who fights with him; Anderson as a smooth-as-silk queen of hearts who wins his affections (temporarily); Beulah Bondi as a wealthy San Franciscan banker's wife who, as the queen of diamonds, figures prominently into the financial dealings that drive the film's plot near the end; and Blanche Yurka, over-the-top as ""The Witch Herrera,"" the matriarch of a Mexican family accused of squatting on The Furies who is both queen of spades and a deadshot, cackling maniacally when she fires at her enemies.

All this may sound a little much, and it's perhaps not as smoothly brought together as one might like. But the cinematography is fantastic (making frequent use of day-for-night shots), and the acting is of as high quality as you might ever expect in a Western. (Only Wendell Corey, as Stanwyck's scheming suitor who loathes her father, is a disappointment; though his performance is fine, he looks like a ventriloquist's dummy, and seems miscast for someone whom Stanwyck keeps speaking of as an Adonis of the Prairie.) The casting of Judith Anderson to play the crucial part of Flo, Vance's rival for T.C.'s attentions, was particularly brilliant: Anderson was celebrated for her stage portrayals of Greek tragedy queens, and only she, perhaps, could have seemed a fit nemesis for Stanwyck (who winds up mutilating her stepmother-to-be with a pair of scissors). The dialogue is meant to be clever, and sometimes is, and sometimes seems overripe. The film's greatest flaw is its softened ending, which veers away from the full Jacobean chaos it seems to promise earlier.",1268438400,4,2808,4.894957983193278

3390027,4,B0016AKSP0,"Anthony Mann cut his teeth in movies directing some of the best ""film noir"" the genre had to offer.
Movies like T-MEN, RAW DEAL, SIDE STREET and DESPERATE showed his strengths in composition, cinematography and gritty realism in his storytelling (if at times a little uneven). However...Mann really hit his stride when he began directing the ""western"". Here Mann is in his element.

1950 was the year that made Anthony Mann a directing icon.  Filmed before 1950's WINCHESTER 73, yet released after is THE FURIES (1950) This is a deliciously demented mixture of film noir and classic western elements.

Walter Huston plays T.C Jeffords, the widowed, ruthless, cold blooded, yet charismatic cattle baron. Barbara Stanwyck plays Hustons spoiled, headstrong tomboy daughter Vance Jeffords. While he has a son (played by John Bromfield) Huston has chosen Stanwyck to be the eventual ruler of his empire once he has retired. However...after being away on a long trip, Huston returns with a new love interest, the more ""society friendly"" Flo (played with great complexity by Judith Anderson)

Flo and Vance butt heads and when it is clear that she is jockeying for control of the ranch and trying to edge out Vance, Stanwyck reacts with a disturbing act of violence that has horrific results. Stanwyck flees the ranch and takes refuge with her long time friend played by Gilbert Roland. Roland is a squatter on Hustons land and in retaliation, Huston reacts with an act of violence of his own to spite Stanwyck.

In the aftermath, Stanwyck spits out the most memorable line of the movie at Huston

""now I hate you in a way I didn't believe a human could hate. Take a good long look at me T.C. You won't see me again until the day I take your world away from you!""

And thus begins an epic clash between father and daughter.

As with all of the Mann westerns, the terrain figures prominently in THE FURIES just as much as in Winchester 73, The Man From Laramie and Man Of The West. Unlike Ford, who emphasized and incorporated the beautiful vistas and sweeping grandeur of the southwest, Mann goes for something different. Mann sets his stage in desolate, remote, dangerously rocky hills. He goes for an almost claustrophobic feel. Bullets richochet off boulders, horse and riders struggle on unsure, gravely ground and rocks and boulders tumble dangerously down hillsides.
In a Mann western, the terrain is just as dangerous and deadly an opponent as any black hat wearing villain.

The film also has a memorable performance by Wendell Corey as a gambling house owner whose father was cheated out of his land by Huston, and who may or may not be an ally of Stanwyck. Also of note is Thomas Gomez as Hustons gleefully evil henchman ""El Tigre"".

It's logical that THE FURIES and Winchester 73 would incorporate a lot of noir style in them as that was Mann's forte prior. But THE FURIES mixes the two genres to the best effect I think. It has possibly some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a B&W western, Red River and Winchester 73 being the possible exceptions.

Again, like most Mann westerns, there is a ""King Lear"" style father figure in Huston. Stanwyck has a wonderful and demented strength and stands toe to toe with the imposing, wiley Huston all the way through. Corey is smartly understated next to these two titans. An excellent film, a great western and on my own personal top 20 greatest movies list.
I suggest getting the Criterion dvd of the movie. It has a great commentary that analyzes practically every frame of the film, an entertaining, fact filled booklet with interesting analysis of the film as well as an unpublished interview with Mann. There is a 1930s era interview with Huston at his home. The set also comes with a new printing of the Niven Busch novel on which the film is based. It is shown in its original aspect ratio.

Mann has always seemed to me to be the bridge between Fords more traditional vision of the west and the bleak, amoral, bloody violence of Peckinpaw. There would be no Peckinpaw without Mann, but there would be no classic Mann westerns without Ford. While The Furies is not as entertaining as the collaborations between Mann and Stewart, it is one heck of a ride and definately worth buying just to see the excellent treatment that Criterion gives this, until now, rarely seen little gem.",1241913600,7,4344,4.761968085106383
3390028,3,B0016AKSP0,"Compared to Anthony Mann's other Westerns, The Furies is certainly something of a disappointment. Released between his first, Winchester `73, and his darkest, Devil's Doorway, of Mann's Westerns, alongside Cimarron, it's easily the weakest. Both are at times more women's pictures set on the range than westerns and both only really work effectively for half their running time - Cimarron for the first half and The Furies in its second once the rather heavy-handed scene-setting is out of the way and the real power struggle begins.

Walter Huston's the cantankerous cattle baron building an empire as much on bank loans and IOUs as old-fashioned range wars. Used to having his own way in his kingdom - he even has his own worthless currency, `T.C.s' - he finds himself going all King Lear on his tomboyish daughter and heir apparent Barbara Stanwyck when she chooses the wrong man (and promptly easily buys him off). Things only get worse for her when she's usurped in her father's affections by Judith Anderson's society lady of a certain age and the scissors come out - literally - and Huston takes out his fury on Stanwyck's childhood friend with the aid of Thomas Gomez' rope-happy foreman. Yet it while it does improve in the last third as the blood starts to flow, it's never as engaging as it could be.

Part soap opera, part Greek tragedy, part stock market drama (it's stocks, a bear raid on the ranch's shares and bank manipulation that are her chosen weapons), it often feels like the film's being pulled in too many different directions to be wholly satisfying, never finding a really cohesive tone. It's almost as if the film has been carved up between the director, actors and producer, each getting their moment to dominate the film but sporadically giving the impression they're all making very different films. Mann's trademarks are visible, from the sadism of one female character being disfigured to one of his beloved mountaintop shootouts (for once not the climax of the film), but his customary visual sense and style simply isn't for all but a few fleeting moments here. It often feels more like an underbudgeted independent picture than a major studio one, with Victor Milner's Oscar-nominated cinematography less than successful whenever the film ventures outdoors: certainly there's nothing to match the adventurousness of Mann's collaborations with the great John Alton. Nor is he able to rise to the material as well as in his later films: he managed the dynastic infighting much more successfully in The Man From Laramie, El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire.

Worse, for a film that revolves around the land, for all the talk about their right to inherit it, the cast are rarely convincingly of the land. Only Huston and Gilbert Roland's squatter really seem at home here: everyone else seems like a visitor from the East. It's not helped by some weak casting - particularly Wendell Corey's dull romantic lead who's about as dangerous as an assistant manager in a shoe shop and John Bromford as her brother.

It's not all bad: Judith Anderson has one wonderful scene telling her new husband why she won't lend him any more money - the only security and assurance a woman in her circumstances can have - there's a powerful lynching scene and you do get to see Huston wrestling a bull in his last film, but it works more in fits and starts than in its entirety. Still, at least Criterion's DVD is impressive, with a 1967 interview with Mann carried over from their El Cid laserdisc, trailer and stills gallery, an at times over-academic audio commentary and a copy of Niven Busch's original novel for good measure.",1241654400,,3647,4.858520900321543

8262040,5,B0016AKSP0,"The Furies

This is an extraordinary Western, at times electrifying in its storytelling. It is about love turned to hatred and the search for revenge.

At its heart is a complex and intense relationship between a father and his daughter. At times they look at each other like lovers, at other times taunt each other and compete for the upper hand. The mans son is an irrelevance to him, his daughter the sole focus of his attention. Most of all, though, he loves power.

She has a relationship with an older man, a squatter on her fathers vast property, who is like a father to her except that they share kisses which seem to go beyond the platonic.

She also develops a relationship with a gambler and businessman which looks like love but has a violent edge to it, kisses often alternating with slaps. Most of all, though, he loves money.

There are two acts of savagery in the film which shock the viewer and illustrate the brutality and ruthlessness to which the perpetrators are willing to go to hurt their enemies. The Director does not dwell on these acts - one occurs offscreen - but this does not lessen their impact.

The director (Anthony Mann), scriptwriter (Charles Schnee) and cinematographer (Victor Milner) have created a film that is noirish, at times an operatic melodrama, but never less than gripping and intriguing. Mann frames the story against a huge, rugged landscape and the night time sequences, rich with moody cloudscapes, are striking.

The father and daughter characters are brilliantly played by Walter Huston and Barbara Stanwyck respectively, both infusing subtle layers and complexity into their portrayals. Another exceptional performer is Judith Anderson, who holds her own in the scenes with the other two formidable actors and breaks the heart in her final scene with Huston.

The film is let down by its finale, whose sentimentality does not fit with the key characterisations so deeply developed in all that has proceeded.

The Criterion edition includes a copy of the fine novel by Niven Busch on which the movie was based. Reading it strengthens ones appreciation of Manns artistry in turning the essence of the book into a great visual experience.

The Furies was released in 1950 and also that year came Winchester 73, the first of Manns superb Westerns starring James Stewart. The former film loses nothing in the comparison.",1514764800,,2370,4.917293233082707
8262041,5,B0016AKSP0,"This is a 1950 Western drama shot in black and white.  It isn't stylistically dated.  The movie is directed by Anthony Mann.  His forte is film noir and westerns.  This movie has elements of both.

This is Walter Huston's last film.  I don't wish to risk being a ""spoiler"".  I find some of the actions of his character reprehensible.  However, there are other times I admire the character's actions.  All in all I feel Walter Huston did a fine job in this, his last role.

The above is not what makes this a ""5 star"" movie for me.  I believe this movie is somewhat forgotten.  What makes this movie to me is Barbara Stanwyck.  I really have trouble identifying my favorite role of Barbara Stanwyck.  However, this ranks with her best.

The picture and sound quality was pristine, considering the cinematography was nominated for an Academy award. I doubt Criterion can do much better than this with the blu-ray release (whenever that happens!!).

Then, along comes Wendell Corey, who plays Rip Darrow.  Miss Stanwyck's father hates Mr. Corey ( years ago he killed Mr. Corey's father in a ""fair fight"" ).  Miss Stanwyck seems to like to anger her father, so she goes for a buggy ride with Mr.  Corey.  He slaps Miss Stanwyck and is rude to her, which she finds sexy and exciting.

If only Mr. Roland had thought of hitting her, he may have become the object of her affection.  Bad things start to happen and Miss Stanwyck seeks revenge on her father.  I am not sure what the moral of this story is, if there is one.  The movie seemed awfully long and is full of unpleasant characters.
