3667265,1,6305719012,"The ""Special Defects"" are hilarious! The captions (in English) alone will keep you in stiches. Those translations that did make sense were comical and many translations made no sense at all. Gong Li is my favorite actress in any language. Goes to show that not even the world's best actor can save a really bad movie.",1175990400,,317,4.678571428571429
3667266,5,6305719012,When I first watched this movie I was amazed. Wonderful story and So truely amazing actresses.  I loved this movie and If you enjoy Old school kung-fu movies then you will love this one as well.  It was like Star Wars on wicked crazy kung-fu crack!! I loved it,1081123200,8,260,4.285714285714286
3667267,3,6305719012,"This typical HK movie is not the best Wing Keung Chien did. The story by itself is very simple (like many HK movies) but characters are well portrayed. The bad point is that visual FX are below the average and the DVD transcription is really poor (maybe it's my DVD Player and/or my TV ;-). Sound quality is not incredible, just ok but I think it's because the movie is a bit old (1994). Anyway, if you're a HK MadMan, buy it else rent it first...Ooops, about bonus materials : nothing...",983750400,9,488,4.373626373626373

3667272,4,6305719012,"Fun wuxia film to watch. Video and sound quality is somewhat lacking, but that is pretty much expected for such an old, hard to find film. The three leading actresses are all wonderful, as expected. A slight twist and blending of timelines of Louis Cha's Demi-Gods, Semi-devils story. I highly recommend reading a bit about that story before watching the film, though, as you might get lost with all the characters and connections due to Dragon Chronicles' fast pace.",1409270400,,467,4.924050632911392
3667273,4,6305719012,"Convoluted as all get out as you might expect from a HK fantasy period piece but hard to beat Brigitte Lin, Gong Li and Sharla Cheung sharing the screen together. Recommended for that reason but also super entertaining watching their characters battle and outwit each other. Great final boss fight and good VFX too. Definitely worth the watch.",1405296000,,343,4.931034482758621
3667274,4,6305719012,"Story: good
acting: good, a little over the top at times
scene transition: great
special affects: for the time, entertaining
you know when you watch this it's not going to be some modern jet li or jackie chan movie. you have to rewind your standards for the time of the film. It's a little corny, the fighting obviously isn't believable (who really flies across valleys etc?) but if you take it like a fairy tale and suspend reality, it's a fun movie. it doesn't try to get you to do that, it's just a prerequisite I guess. It reminds me of movies from my child hood. oh- the subs are funny sometimes.",1395273600,,601,4.375
3667275,5,6305719012,"Good or I should say excellent for the 90's. It was better watching this film this time. I guess maybe because I have gotten used to watching Chinese movies. All the various aspects they employ such as the wire work, yes lots of flying in this movie.  Since this is a Chinese movie the translation wording in English is quite humorous  at times.

All in all this is a well done film. You might say they set the creative standard for Chinese Martial Arts, Myths and scenery. The acting is well done. I think anyone viewing this movie well like it.",1392422400,,546,4.3861386138613865
3667276,3,6305719012,could have been more action with less far out woman acts that don't fit n the picture!! I hated parts of it!!,1391126400,,109,4.0
3667277,4,6305719012,"If you like Wuxia films and are alright with viewing a subtitled film (and do not care if the story is so complex you will need multiple viewings to fully grasp it), this is for you.
Brigitt Lin stars in the role of evil/good twin sisters and is convincing as ever, Gong Li [usually not an actress to be found in Wuxia] plays an excellent love-struck villain.

The subtitles are sometimes slightly wrong (both grammar, vocabulary and register), but are much better than, say, the ones from Beijing Opera Blues.

The martial arts scenes are well-choreographed and well-executed.

The story (in a nutshell):
Gong Li and the twins played by Brigitte Lin are members of a Wuxia sect whose leader has been poisoned by a rival. Instead of trying to avenge their teacher, the three women fall out with each other because the twins are both in love with their teacher (who only loves one of them) and Gong Li, in turn, is in love with the twin who is favoured by their leader. [I did say it was complicated].
The rival who poisoned their master is bent on destroying all other Wuxia sects and gaining the power of the women's sect leader. However, an innocent monk happens to be given the leader's power instead. He manages to unite the women against their master's killer and they overcome him in the end.
As most Wuxia films, this film also has no happy ending. Love remains unconsummated.
All villains also have a humane streak in them that makes the viewer pity their lot.

4 stars mainly because of the excellent cast.
Story and film: 3 stars.",1209427200,,1540,4.589090909090909

8315576,2,6305719012,"A bit boring. Not martial arts, not horror, not sci-fi. Mixes genres in a very uninteresting way.",1473033600,,97,4.764705882352941

8315579,3,6305719012,"If you don't understand Chinese folklore, or at least the concept behind it. (Buddhism against the old mythologies, demigod's, chi etc.) This movie is going to be REALLY confusing. I got it on the first run through...mostly. The acting was great by the leading ladies. The story crammed in A LOT of things, and didn't do necessarily all of it well. As others have said the special effects are really dated, and about the first 1/3 of the movie is pretty darn slow.

I do enjoy that I saw it to the end though, even if the final battle was kind of anti-climactic.",1451001600,,562,4.456310679611651

8315581,2,6305719012,"Not sure if there was actually a plot to this movie. Mostly it was just a variety of indistinguishable characters who may have been kung-fu masters, oriental demons, demi-gods, or sorcerers flying around against a green screen shooting globs of various colored light at each other.",1435968000,,281,5.130434782608695
