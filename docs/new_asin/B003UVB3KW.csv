8406196,4,B003UVB3KW,"Although the package claims that there are two languages available on the disc (the original German and English), when I play it there is only one language option that appears on the screen and that is ""Deutsch"" - there is no ""English"" option to select.  I have spoken to Samsung (my TV's manufacturer) help line and they say that the problem is with the disk.  That if the two language options do not show on the starting screen - then there is only the single choice  actually on the disc.  You  need to be aware of this.
If somebody reading this can offer a suggestion to me how to get the English soundtrack, I'd be glad to hear about it.  Thanks.
