8431536,2,B004J2M0QC,So very disappointed in this series. It's just not funny. I love Geoffrey Palmer but this show lacks humor. I'll try to sell it on eBay.,1507593600,,136,4.269230769230769
8431537,5,B004J2M0QC,"Since I was about 9, I have been watching British comedies (and dramas and documentaries), thanks to my city's award-winning PBS station.

I came home from college, UT, which is hell for anyone who isn't a certain ""type"" of person.  A bit depressed I turned to my beloved station for comedies to lift my mood.  In that year they broadcast Butterflies.  I couldn't believe it.  It was funny, romantic, political, and an observation on family life. And even though I was only SIX when they first broadcast it in the UK, I could understand it in the 1990s, being in college.

The station had not broadcast it since and I have been waiting for years for them to put this on DVD.  There are/were only 2 series/seasons on North American format and it has been hard for me to find THOSE.

So I was pleased to find an entire collection in the format for the UK.  I even bought a multi-region player just to watch them.",1466035200,,910,4.433734939759036

I had seen the first two seasons, but the last two seasons have never been available in the states. I just love this series, which I found thoughtful and exciting, very romantic, sometimes frustrating. It's rare when you can sympathize with all three characters in a love triangle. The ending was a bit sad, but when three people are involved, one of them must be disappointed eventually. The complete collection includes a Christmas special, but unfortunately not the 15-minute BBC charity reunion done in the early 2000s. Still, no complaints. I really enjoyed this!",1421625600,4,660,5.009090909090909
