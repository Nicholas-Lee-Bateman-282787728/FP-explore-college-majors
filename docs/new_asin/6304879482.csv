It is heartbreaking and will leave you in tears, but at the  same time it is an intriguing and beautiful love story. Jennifer Jason  Leigh does a superb job as Catherine.

935869,4,6304879482,"19th century master Henry James almost always focused his keen, detailed eye on the upper crust and their stubborn efforts to keep their status.
What sets this work apart from other recent period gabfests is  the moxy of its heroine. She doesn't just fall in love; she develops a real  backbone and character. As portrayed by Jennifer Jason Leigh in one of her  most vivid performances, Catherine Sloper is a plain thing. She's  unambitious and rather garish in taste. She clings to papa, an  even-tempered doctor played with the usual prowess by Albert Finney.
When Catherine meets Morris Townsend, a stud with nothing but cobwebs in  his wallet, she's smitten, and so is he. Wait a minute. Hunks aren't  supposed to like dopes like Catherine. Except if there's a possible payoff.
Drop Jane Austen from your list. She's surface. The tough stuff is  written by James. Washington Square isn't a chess match with human pieces;  nor is it a cutesy, cuddly dating game played out in English manors. It's  Americana, boys and girls. And, in the end, it has the courage of its  dramatic convictions. Hooray!",950400000,10,1101,4.865591397849462
935870,2,6304879482,"Having both read the Henry James novel whence comes the title, if little else, of this film, and been charmed by the original adaptation ""The Heiress"", I was interested to see what a new interpretation might  betoken: little of merit, I'm, sad to say. Where the original( both novel  and film) had subtlety and depth of characterization, this one was blatant  with actors following simple-minded leitmotifs. Where the original  expressed the nobility and honor befitting the era, this one offered  one-dimensional soap-operaish travesties. The new Katherine is such a  clumsy fool, literally stumbling and falling down in almost every scene)  lacking the wit to finish a sentence, that one doesn't empathize with her  so much as pity her as being something of a retarded mutation. The new  Morris is not much better. The new Dr. Sloper is uniformly heartless and  completely lacking in the severe dignity with which James provided him.
This film lacking intelligence, tries to overwhelm us with maudlin  sentiment -- it fails to an embarassing degree. The depth of feeling  rendered in the original is lost here.  JJL simply lacks the finesse of  Olivia de Havilland, although she seems remarkably well-rehearsed in her  many pratfalls.
Albert Finney seems a brute in comparison with the  elegant Ralph Richardson. Anyone who watches both films will see what I  mean.

936020,5,6304879482,"My husband and myself both really enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting by Jennifer Jason Leigh was quite good and also by Ben Chaplin. But I felt Albert Finney was superb! I also very much enjoyed the book. Yes, they may have exaggerated her character to some degree, but being a person who suffers from social anxiety, and who also went through a supremely shy period in my adolescence, I can relate. They may have made her more inept in the movie, but I feel it didn't ruin the movie, as I just viewed it as her being someone who grew up in a household devoid of real love or any proper guidance for her lot in life. Plus the fact that she felt inferior because of that lack of love, and her fathers seething and insidious resentment and disappointment in her.
I normally, as I do now, rate a movie on it's superb and subtle acting and it's ability to be thought provoking and moving, which this movie had to some degree, but I did also enjoy the beauty of the film that was brought about by the direction and set design of Agnieszka Holland.
No, I would not put it on my top rated movies for acting ability, though, as I already stated there was some solid acting, and Albert Finney was a wonderfully awful father, with nice subtlety, and I really enjoyed the acting of the woman who played Albert Finney's sister - though I cannot remember her name.
All in all, for a modern American movie I feel it was about as top quality as you're going to get any more. There was a bit of caricaturistic acting by Maggie Smith and some light acting by others, but still somehow it was intriguing and enjoyable. I felt it was compelling and very interesting, and very poignant. I also feel the subject matter of the plainness (or less pejoratively - averageness) of a woman's appearance affecting her value as a desirable human, or wife is quite a sad commentary on societies mores and values.
That being said, I loved the movie! And I felt deeply for Catherine's unloved, devalued and tread upon character. I felt the ending had so many captivating emotions and reflections to chew upon.
I would definitely recommend this movie to those who don't depend upon the special effects and magical thinking of Hollywood to entertain them, but like good acting and good old fashioned stories, that absorb your thinking and emotional processes.",1443398400,2,2331,4.552380952380952

The costuming and sets are fabulous and the actors play their parts with feeling and authenticity. The ending of this film is completely different to the earlier one  but it shows how the heroine did over a period of time develop independence and a strength of purpose.  This I believe is due to the harsh and inconsiderate treatment metered out to her by the significant males in her life.  This different ending to the film certainly re-enforces the strength that some of the women of this particular era  developed in spite of their often humiliating and unjust treatment by the society of the day.

936072,4,6304879482,"Washington Square was based on the book of the same name by Henry James, the author who also wrote Wings of a Dove and Portrait of a Lady. Going in, it helps to know that he is known for realism and also the dark nature of his work. If you are looking for a rollicking good time or romance, this is not it. This is more of an anti-romance.

The story is an entertaining one, even if it is somewhat confusing. The characters are not as fleshed out as they are in the book, so everything that hinges on having a clear sense of character (meaning everything), is weakened. It holds together, but is not as psychologically satisfying as it could be.

The actors are solid, but Leigh is a bit off. It's not her acting. She does a great job of being naive, then later, disillusioned, but she is just too old for the young part. It's distracting.

If you are looking for something different, I'd give it a shot. This is definitely not your typical Hollywood flick. It leaves you wondering... which is a good thing.",1424044800,2,1007,4.345744680851064

The rest of the cast is great as well, the production design and photography are beautiful, and the screenplay generally sticks to James's dialogue.

She gives a stellar performance as a terribly wounded, but resilient character. I also enjoyed The Heiress, which was a play adaptation rather than a book adaptation as was this movie. I have to say, though, I think the WS version has a more uplifting ending then the revenge filled Katherine at the closing scene of The Heiress. In that movie she turned as heartless as her tormentors. It made for great drama, but in WS I like that Katherine redirects her devotion, rising above the men who were not worthy of her love in the first place.  Though Olivia D's ending was more dramatic, this one gave you a better feeling at the end. Both movies are jam packed with great performances from talented casts.

936116,2,6304879482,"I have always maintained that there are laudable attributes to the manner in which the old Hollywood studio system chose to depict a story; the wisdom was in their ability to distill any given story down to its most vital essence, thus doing away with the distracting elements of a faithful"" transcription of the original source material.

Taking this into consideration, I still prefer the older movie The Heiress with Ralph Richardson as Dr. Sloper, Olivia de Havilland as Catherine Sloper and Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Lavinia.

The contemporary approach now in vogue, is to take a more direct approach which borders on transcribing a work practically verbatim in painful detail; dispensing with the proclivity to take artistic license for fear of corrupting the plot and obscuring greater insights.

In Washington Square the dreadful depiction of Catherine Sloper is unbearable as she comes off as a nearly mentally challenged young woman throughout the movie.

Even at the end when she is disinherited by her father, her attempt at portraying acknowledgement and acceptance of the cruel irony of the situation is conveyed in such an odd manner that is both unconvincing as it is bizarre.
There is a glaring mistake or inconsistency wherein Catherine is shown wearing a spectacularly vulgar gown she had made for the important Townsend festivities, much to the astonishment of both her father and aunt.

In reality this would not have happened in those days as she would have deferred to the advice of her aunt who would have been her chaperone; although the aunt is depicted as being over accommodating in that respect as we witness Dr. Sloper chiding her for being remiss in her duties, particularly where they apply to Morris Townsends attentions towards Catherine.

The portrayal of Dr. Sloper by Albert Finney is overtly brusque and consistently teetering on the brink of an act of brutality compared to that of Ralph Richardson who was able to convey his anger and disgust with cutting wit and eloquence.

Maggie Smith is channeling herself in her roll as Aunt Lavinia, which may be suitable for Downton Abbey but her recent over reliance on this tactic is growing tiresome and is not a positive testament to her considerable acting abilities.

Ben Chaplins performance as Morris Townsend is acceptable and minimally succeeds in enhancing the characters role as a mercenary fortune hunter.

The scene of the death of Dr. Slopers wife upon giving birth to Catherine is an obvious attempt to underscore the psychological reasons for Dr. Slopers bitter resentment towards Catherine but that sentiment was conveyed just clearly with just a few lines of dialogue in the 1949 version.
The Townsend party dance scene is clumsily handled and the elongated scene of Catherine and Morris tripping over one another is silly.

All in all, I think the direction of this production is slightly misguided and heavy handed and lacks the subtle yet tangible power of the legendary director William Wyler. Old school still works.",1415750400,6,3018,5.066532258064516

from a little girl embarrassed to perform in public. And then Morris meets Aunt Penniman in a sordid part of town where prostitutes meet customers behind torn muslin and while Morris and Livina are conversing, you hear the grunts and moaning in the background.
Jennifer Jason Leigh's portrayal of Catherine Sloper left me wondering what (if any) direction she received during the course of filming. When she and Morris are initially introduced at the party to announce her cousin's engagement, she trips and nearly falls several times....it was way over the top. She acted more like a stroke victim than a shy, introverted girl with no self confidence.
I thought Ben Chaplin (Morris) was about the only character that was believable of all the cast.

When her father takes away the extra inheritance she would get from him, will Morris still want to marry her, or leave her in the lurch?  The prior role of the Aunt, played earlier by Miriam Hopkins, is played well by Maggie Smith.",1384560000,,838,4.480263157894737

Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, Ben Chaplin, Judith Ivey--the entire cast--is pure gold.  Washington Square itself becomes a main character, and a complex one, it is.  I recommend this brutal movie about upper-middle class American life in nineteenth-century New York.  It is particularly moving about a pampered yet abused child, comparable in its different way to Now Voyager with Bette Davis as the abused daughter of a monstrous mother rather than a cruel, cold father in this film, played by Albert Finney.

Veteran theatrical star Judith Ivey,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Addams-Family/dp/B0035LJY6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Addams Family</a>), appears as Mrs. Almond, the doctor's other sister; a young Jennifer Garner,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghosts-of-Girlfriends-Past/dp/B002LAZEJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</a>), appears as Marian Almond, Mrs. Almond's eldest daughter who does everything right by Victorian standards, including making an appropriate, ""punctual"" marriage.

Dr. Austin Sloper, a rich respected physician, lives in Washington Square, New York, with his only surviving child, Catherine. She is a sweet-natured young woman who greatly disappointments her brilliant domineering father; he thinks her physically plain and dull of personality and intellect. Mind you, Sloper's beloved, beautiful and vivacious wife had died a week after giving birth to Catherine, so it seems obvious that the doctor also holds her mother's death against the young woman.  (The Doctor's three-year-old son had died two years earlier.) Sloper's widowed sister, Lavinia, a foolish woman, is the only other member of the  household.

Catherine meets the tall, handsome and charming Morris Townsend at Mrs. Almond's party celebrating her daughter Marian's engagement; she is strongly attracted to him. Morris instantly proceeds to court Catherine; he is aided in this enterprise by Mrs. Penniman, who craves drama.  Dr. Sloper strongly disapproves of the courtship, as he believes Morris to be a fortune-hunter. Thus, when the young couple announces their engagement, the doctor looks into Morris's background.  He visits Mrs. Montgomery, the young man's sister.  Sloper thereby learns that Townsend, who has run through his small inheritance wandering  Europe, has been a parasitic spendthrift to his poor widowed sister and her five children. So the doctor forbids his daughter to marry Townsend, whom he considers to be a 'selfish idler.'  Poor Catherine cannot decide between the loyalty she feels she owes her father, and the devotion she feels for her fianc.

Dr. Sloper understands Catherine's predicament and even pities her.  But he tells her that he will disinherit her if she marries Morris; then takes her on a far-ranging year's tour of Europe to help her forget her young suitor. During this time, he mentions Catherine's engagement only twice: once while they are alone in the Alps, and again on the eve of their return. On both occasions, Catherine holds firm in her determination to marry. After her second refusal to give up her projected marriage, Sloper angrily compares her to a sheep fattened for slaughter. He has finally gone too far: Catherine sees his contempt, withdraws from him, readies herself to give her love  to Morris.

Jennifer Jason Leigh does all right as Catherine, though I've never been a big fan of her super-intense style.  Ben Chaplin does better than you might expect; he's no Montgomery Clift,(who played the part in the 1949 movie)  but he does manage to infuse his fortune-hunter with a certain sense of vulnerability, as did Clift. (Though Clift, of course, did it better.) Albert Finney does well as the  doctor.  Smith, in her role as Lavinia, is that silly woman to the life.  Ivey and Garner are fine in their supporting parts.

While this film takes some liberties with the original text, it  hews more closely to the book than did the much more popular and better-known film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Heiress-Universal-Cinema-Classics/dp/B000KGGJ1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Heiress (Universal Cinema Classics)</a>, directed by William Wyler, released in 1949.  That earlier  film  memorably starred Olivia De Havilland (an Oscar winner for this), Montgomery Clift, Ralph Richardson and Miriam Hopkins.  It was  based upon the stage play of the same name, by Ruth and Augustus Goetz, which adapted the novel. That play was originally performed on Broadway in 1947 with Wendy Hiller as Catherine and Basil Rathbone as Dr. Sloper. (It was most recently revived  in 2012. And I managed to see it, starring Jessica Chastain, Dan Stevens, Judith Ivey, and David Strathairn.  What a cast, what a treat!  And hasn't Judith Ivey made a specialty of this entertainment!)  Both the earlier play and movie stuck closely to the novel and took many of the best lines directly from James' dialogue. However, the Goetz version does make a few changes to the story and to the character of Catherine, making her eventually sly enough to plan revenge on Morris, abruptly sending him off.  The Goetz version also had Catherine, in fact, receiving her full inheritance, which makes her revenge on Morris even  sweeter.  And it introduced the two great dramatic bookends of the story, Morris's jilting of Catherine on the way to the altar, and her revenge: neither of these two riveting set pieces is used in the later film.

Nor was I pleased with some of the liberties taken by this later film.  It introduces two vulgar scenes, found nowhere in James' novel, or anywhere in that sensitive man's work.  It also introduces a scene of the older spinster Catherine apparently running a day care center in her luxurious Washington Square home.  Now, critics agree that any work of literature or art  that lasts more than a century must allow succeeding generations to read it their way, and this is certainly true of WASHINGTON SQUARE.  The script of this movie tries to present Catherine an early feminist, and, although James certainly didn't see her this way, the material does allow it.  But running a day care center in her home?  The novel was published and set in 1880.  Jane Addams, the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was a pioneer social worker and founder of Chicago's Hull House.  She was born only in 1860.  So she would have been 20 in 1880, and hardly have had time even to found Hull House, let alone invent daycare centers.

Well, I missed the two great dramatic scenes--the sequential mutual jiltings-- from THE HEIRESS, and had negative reactions to the additions made to this script. Can't recommend this film: if you ask me, it deserved to flop. It did.",1363305600,6,7705,6.0027447392497715
936239,1,6304879482,"The central problem with this adaption of the Henry James novel is in the casting of the female lead. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays her as if she is mentally impaired.

The story unfolds too slowly, relating the events of the book without editing, heightening or above all, dramatizing them. Catherine Slocum remains a passive victim throughout.

While it is clear you cannot repeat something that's already been done, though keep in mind, you cannot repeat the magic from the original film neither.

And Jennifer Jason Leigh as Catherine is so lifeless and dull. The characters in this film were so underdeveloped and bland. I just don't think that the casting worked.

936277,3,6304879482,"I'm going to go ahead and compare it to the older movie I thought it was a remake of, since I've seen that done so much at other customer-review sites. Everywhere online, I see Ben Chaplin sneered at as being ""no Montgomery Clift"" and a pathetic ""substitute."" Narrow, self-limiting, empty-skulled admissions of never having heard of Henry James or realized this movie closely follows THE NOVEL of which ""The Heiress"" was only a loose adaptation. How pointless to all look at each other and sniff in unison that this beautiful, talented actor compares poorly to Montgomery Clift. For one thing, he doesn't! Ben Chaplin is wonderful as Morris Townsend.

I don't read Henry James, don't care for him, and didn't know ""Washington Square"" had been a novel. I wanted and expected from the movie a remake of ""The Heiress,"" and was disappointed enough to throw my hair-scrunchie at the TV when it ended. But compare the two endings: ""Catherine..!"" Morris pounding with his fists on the locked door. ""Catherine!"" Frantic pounding increases. ""Catherine! Catherine!!!"" to ""I don't hate you, Morris, but please don't ever come here again.""

For the broader audience, ""Washington Square"" is a dud that could only work as a movie if ""The Heiress"" hadn't preceded it. Or on thinking twice, I guess without The Heiress to precede it--without the shorter, punchier, more obvious adaptation gotten out of the way--the dull but faithful ""Washington Square"" wouldn't have been made at all.

I didn't like Aunt Lavinia in this movie. Realistic though she probably was, I thought she was just too repulsive, more tolerable and interesting in ""The Heiress"". Albert Finney was as good as Ralph Richardson, in other words fantastically great. I love Jennifer Jason Leigh, but thought her Catherine came across as too ugly. It was distracting, that sallow skin, those small yellow teeth, knowing how lovely she really is. For some reason, that same issue works FOR the story, rather than against it, with Olivia de Havilland's Catherine.

""Washington Square"" shows us parts of the story that are left out of ""The Heiress,"" like Catherine's misery and awkwardness as an adoring little girl to her chilly papa, and the lurid depiction of Catherine's birth killing her mother. That kind of opening scene can be a huge draw, but I found the tragic birth scene (as presented) embarrassingly unlikely.

The haunting piano song in ""Washington Square"" carried the day! I'd watch it again and again for that song, for Albert Finney, and for Ben Chaplin.",1324857600,,2518,5.014354066985646
936278,5,6304879482,"Darwinism, selective adaptation, rationalism, a stone cold universe--these are the main characters in the film adaptation of Henry James' novel ""Washington Square."" I wept for the futility of the motives of the players.  Forlorn-ness, weariness, desperation--these are feelings Henry James (author) passed out with plenitude to both Morris and Catherine, the exquisitely needy main characters.

Catherine, an only child, who lives at Washington Square, under the strict supervision of her doctor-father, is the most emotionally deplete character to begin. Played with utmost perfection, with downward stares, gazes from under obedient eyes, a shrinking of body in the presence of men, Jennifer Jason-Leigh lived that character. So does Chaplin with Morris with perfect beauty, necessary emotional repertoire and glib talent with tongue and ready story. He is as extraordinarily handsome as she is plain. Yet, by steady and intense tender attention, he brings out a Catherine no one has ever seen, least of all her domineering father.

This is a story of want meeting need, with each discovering in the other the answer to each dilemma, with one (Morris) knowing what is needed, the other (Catherine) just feeling what is wanted. They meet at an engagement party (so ripe a setting for possibility). It is amazing to watch Chaplin see Catherine and fall instantly in love with her. Or is it a game? Her father, the wealthy doctor, thinks so and discourages her at every turn. Personally, I watched carefully for any slippage in his facial control to detect a false face or mocking smile. But never. He seemed genuinely to care. On the other hand Catherine refuses--initially-- to accept or believe his intentions. Her father has well-trained her to believe she is stupid and plain and desired by men only for her future fortune.

At the beginning when I spoke of despair and weariness, I mentioned these in accordance with the scientific and philosophic views of the day: the cold indifference of the universe, the non-involvement of the religious with daily life, almost a cold, calculating universe in its own way.

There is in some religious circles today the belief that prayer not only changes the one prayed for, but the one doing the praying. Although an anachronism, surely the context is the same: Morris does fall in love with this poor creature he is wooing. That is my impression. Of course, she loses herself passionately.

That's all I need say about the film. For sure, it is a powerful drama that unfolds before one's eyes and, for sure, the ending is both expected and incredibly sad. Yes, how can we ever push ego into the bushes and seize the moment and take a chance? Why are we so stubborn? Can there occur a merging  between these two? What would it take? Everything? Nothing? Can we go too far past a certain point? Oh, I could keep asking these questions, but the answer remains the same: It is what James made it to be. His book reflects the values not only of his day, but our day as well. The story could go differently today, but should it? Can there be too much in a relationship to return to its purer moments?",1324166400,3,3139,4.889097744360902

The first mistake in making Washington Square, which by the way is the the original title of the book by Henry James, was in casting Jennifer Jason Leigh. Of all the actors that could have been chosen, I couldn't understand how they picked her. I like Jennifer as an actress, but not in this movie.

936281,4,6304879482,"If you are, like me, a fan of opulent, well-researched period movies, ""Washington Square"" will not disappoint.  In fact, it should impress you.  Everything about the production values are rich and detailed, although a bit rose-tinted.

The costuming is particularly sumptious.  I feel that it is, not only accurate, but it serves as an imporatant character-shaping devise.  Clumsy, graceless Catherine is so overcome with all aspects of social customs that even her clothes are antagonistic.  She seems to be wrestling with her shawls, attacked by her hair-bobs, and practically consumed by her finery.  Interestingly, it is when Catherine in in Switzerland and finally undertsands her Father's true opinion of her, that a violent breeze lifts one of those strangulating stoles of of her shoulders and sends it sailing away in the rough and dangerous wind.

The performances are stunning and memeorable.  I give every leading actor my highest praise, except for Jennifer Jason Leigh.  She is utterly ridiculous in the first third of the movie.  Her raming into door sils, falling on dusty streets, and head butts with Morris while dancing made me think I was watching a Carol Burnett skit.  Thankfully, as Catherine grows stronger, these odvious pratfalls disappear and Leigh's performance moves into the solid, superior, and haunting kind of acting that we expect and treasure from her.

Chaplin is excellent as the mercenary suitor, Morris.  Albert Finney is astoundingly powerful.  I love Maggie Smith as Livinia and marvel at how she can transform some of the wildest bits of business into an acting x-ray of a tortured and arrested individual.  Judith Ivey is charmingly plain-spoken and a good jouster for the bombastic Dr. Sloper.  Even Jennifer Gardner delivers a moving performance in such a dinky role.

The direction is dense and firey - but it seems too blatant at times.  I applaud the writer and directors for finding the humor, which I think permeates the novel.  But it is, at times, heavy handed.  This is probably why JJL seems to be channeling Lucille Ball in her early courtship scenes with Morris.  Throughout, there are giddy chamber maids, wrist slappings, grunts, tumbles, and fumbles that distract rather than articulate.

Comparing with ""The Heiress"" with Olivia deHavilland and Montgomery Cliff doesn't is useless.  They are very different in their fundamental approach to the story.

936283,4,6304879482,"In ""Washington Square,"" Henry James examines the fascinating dynamic of what a handsome, worldly but penniless man might see in a plain rich woman. Henry James, like E.M. Forster, is fascinated with attempts of couples to break out of predictable pairings based on social class and color.

At first the relationship between Catherine Sloper, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Morris Townsend, played by Ben Chaplin, seems sincere and of the theme ""love will prevail.""

Catherine's controlling father, played by Albert Finney, proves obstinately against their union, and the viewer must decide whether he was right in his assessment of Morris or whether he engineered Morris's eventual cynicism by forcing the lovers into a year apart. The role of Catherine's widowed aunt, Maggie Smith, is implied but not explicit in souring the relationship and could have used a sharper explanation in the screenplay.

At the end the viewer must judge whether Catherine enjoys a real or Pyrrhic victory over her father and Morris, or merely goes into some sort of Zen, above-the-fray state of mind.

Tidbit: ""Washington Square"" was filmed around Baltimore's Union Square, standing in for New York and Paris as well. During the filming, I saw  Maggie Smith poke out of her trailer, parked for a shot near the Pratt Library's main branch.

936284,5,6304879482,"I am reviewing this film from a very narrow perpective. After seeing this film on television, I came to realize that the setting of a scene - where father and daughter ( Finney and Leigh ) are visiting Paris in hopes the the latter will forsake her mercenary lover - was shot in Baltimore, MD. Having lived there for 60 years, I noticed that the backdrop for the celebratory Paris scene was actually the Washington Monument which is located on Charles St. in downtown Baltimore ( Peabody Circle ). This locale was also the setting for another Hollywood movie, "" Bedroom Window "". This leads me to believe that perhaps the entire production of ""Washington Square"" was filmed in Baltimore, since the row homes where the Slopers lived is very similar to Bolton Hills ( an exclusive neighborhood in Baltimore).

Additionally, the father to Jennifer Garner, who played the newly married relative of Catherine, was acted by Arthur Laupus, a well-known local Baltimorean noted for his numerous dinner theater portrayals. I would note that Arthur ( Otts ) was my roommate our freshman year at Towson State Teachers College and we recently renewed our acquaintence at our 50th class reunion.

My purpose for relaying this information is bring to light the setting of this excellent film. The acting is uniformly sterling. This was unquestionably James' finest work and the film does it more that justice. Accolades all around for direction, setting, acting, costuming, musical composiiton, and Baltimore for showing forth its best face.",1292630400,,1527,5.031620553359684

936286,4,6304879482,"Henry James' WASHINGTON SQUARE is well served in this solid film whose screenplay was adapted by Carol Doyle and has been directed with secure wisdom of James' style by Polish director Agnieszka Holland )'Europa, Europa', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Copying Beethoven', etc).  The musical score is in the capable hands of Jan AP Kaczmarek and the Director of Photography is Jerzy Zielinski, and with all these elements in place, the last ingredient in making this a successful adaptation of a Henry James novel is the cast.

Fortunately the assembled cast matches the above credentials.  Albert Finney is superb as the wealthy Dr. Austin Sloper who hoards his money in his mansion on Washington Square and whose overprotective rule of his less than attractive daughter Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) - who is also under the influence of her overbearing Aunt Lavinia (Maggie Smith, still chewing the scenery as usual but convincing) - has put an impasse to Catherine's infatuation with the handsome but poor Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin): if Catherine should choose to marry Morris she would be cut off as his heiress.  James' models of womanhood are played well by Jennifer Garner as the niece that marries and breeds and her mother Aunt Elizabeth (Judith Ivey, currently wowing audiences in a revival of 'The Glass Menagerie').  Distance, imposed by the disapproving Dr. Sloper in escorting Catherine to Europe for a year, doesn't appear to squelch the passion between Catherine and Morris, but Morris finds work which takes him away from the returned Catherine, only to learn upon return that Catherine will not inherit her father's fortune - a glitch that sadly changes the relationship of what had appeared to be a true love romance.  In the end the film follows Henry James' view of the world of his time - a palette for social criticism. Made in 1997, this film holds up very well indeed.

If your a huge fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh, just buy it. There aren't too many actresses w/her range, intensity, and indepth talent obviously.
BTW she also is supposed to be playing a dim-witted young girl.

936300,5,6304879482,"I saw this movie about five years ago and liked it, but was a bit disappointed in the ending.  I'm a big fan of movies based on books by Jane Austen, so I'm used to everything working out in the end.  Recently I viewed ""Washington Square"" a second time and found it extremely compelling and thought provoking (as well as being entertaining).  Catherine and Morris are complex characters and you never really know exactly what they are thinking or what their motivations truly are.  I think Morris wanted Catherine's money, but I'm not convinced that he was simply a fortune hunter.  I think he felt like he and Catherine could make each other reasonably happy and he wouldn't have to toil for his living, which he seemed to think was beneath him.  After the trip abroad, why did Catherine refuse to ask her father again for his consent as Morris obviously wanted her to?  She was willing to risk losing Morris in order not to beg of her father.  Perhaps she knew it was pointless, but it seemed to me that she just flat out refused to even try.  When Morris says ""Yes, I wanted you and I wanted your money, is that so horrible?"", I found myself sympathizing with him--was it so horrible to want both?  After all, he doesn't say ""I never wanted you, I only wanted the money."" At one point the married aunt says something to the father along the lines of ""you've worked all your life for your fortune, can you not give it to Catherine and allow her to have it in a happy state.""  But the father isn't willing to do that--I don't think simply because he views Morris as a fortune hunter, but also because he harbors deep resentment and refuses to see Catherine happy when he was denied happiness due to his wife dying in childbirth.  It's wonderful to watch a movie where the main character evolves and that happens with Catherine in this film.  She is a much changed person in a span of eight to ten years.  Another viewer may read this review and feel very differently about the happenings of the story.  That is what is so compelling about this film--it forces you to think and it certainly makes you feel.",1245196800,8,2106,4.462140992167102
936301,4,6304879482,"Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as Catherine Soper in this film version of Henry James' ""Washington Square"" is one of the great acting cameos of the 1990s. Cruelly exposed to her father's psychological abuse,we see her undergo agonies of low self-esteem and self-loathing until,in the movie's final stages,the worm turns. It is this transformation at the end of the film that leaves us dwelling upon what has preceded it. In addition to the cold downputting by her father,played convincingly by Albert Finney,Catherine suffers yet again from the exploitative manoeuvres of her aunt and,last but not least,by her supposed ""amour"",Maurice Townsend,played by Ben Chaplin. His performance rises above its earlier Uriah Heep awfulness as he displays the cold and selfish innermost layers of his heart. In a world where she is constantly treated as a tool of the male sex,Catherine's ultimate response is devastatingly shown at the end. At least she has become her own person but the cost has been high and she will never,we think,be able to open up again to any displays of human warmth.
The recreation of late C19 New York is a feast for the eyes in this production. The house in Washington Square exhibits well the mental tidiness of the times. It's built on a wealthy,large scale but its many spaces reflect the coldness that characterises the running of family life in its big,empty rooms. The costumes,the food,the music: all underlie the strict mores of the genteel set of that time. There is little room here for big warm fires and happy partying and a daughter must do what others decide for her.
This production is every bit as good as the earlier Joan Fontaine/Montgomery Clift version,in black and white.

936327,4,6304879482,"Honestly, this was one of my favorite films until I read the book, and it brought to light two things that I think the director really messed up on.
1.  Catherine Sloper was nowhere near as socially retarded in the book as she was in the movie.  In fact, as someone said, in the movie they practically portray her as being borderline mentally challenged.  In the books her faults were not as exaggerated, and consisted of her plain looks, dull personality and occasional lack of a witty retort (which happens to all of us save for those annoying few who always have the perfect thing to say).  Otherwise I would characterize her, especially in comparison to her flighty aunt and cold-hearted dad, as the only normal one in the house.  While everyone else was making the situation with Morris more of a  drama than it needed to be, Catherine was taking things as they came and letting them go as they went.  She grows from naive girl who adored her callous father to a secure woman.
  Also, while in the movie they portrayed her dress sense as evidence of her social ineptitude (the scene where she goes to the party where she meets Morris in that awful fringed thing), in the book it is an admirable eccentricity, and proves that she is not as boring as she seems.
 2. While Albert Finney does a great job of capturing Dr. Sloper's callous sarcasm, he doesn't (and again, I think this is the director's fault) really capture the type of psychological game he is playing with his daughter.  In the book, Dr. Sloper detachedly views the goings on between his daughter and Morris as a kind of entertainment, a play that he wants to see if he guessed the correct ending to.  In return, as Catherine realizes what as asshat her father is (can I say that here?), she begins to play the game with him, telling him when he is near his deathbed that she can't promise she won't marry Morris after he dies (This scene also takes place in the movie, but the way it is acted out you get the sense that Catherine is saying this because she hasn't let Morris go yet - the director hasn't developed the character enough to make the viewer believe she has the intelligence to play her dad's own game).
  In terms of praise, the performances by Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and Ben Chaplin are great.  To quote another review again, Ben Chaplin really has you wondering what exactly are his character motives (even though deep down you know he wants her money, like the naive Catherine, you continue to want to believe everyone is wrong).  I admit I picked up the book in the first place because I wanted to get a better handle on Morris and his intentions!  Also, the soundtrack is just gorgeous.",1170115200,47,2679,4.513457556935818

936329,4,6304879482,"Any filmmaker taking on a James adaptation MUST make casting his primary concern since all of James' works are character driven.  This film was partially successful.

Jennifer Jason-Leigh's interpretation of Catherin Sloper was interesting to me but I found the characterisation taken to jarring extremes.  Another review declared at times she appeared so socially backward as to be retarded and I agree with him.  Thus it was more jarring to see her one moment squirming and tongue-tied before Townsend, the next moment smoothly inviting him to play piano at her home.  I try to refrain from age-attacking actresses but I do feel she was a little too old for the role as well.

Ben Chaplin is gorgeous but I found Townsend unsympathetic in the film.  Townsend's character is supposed to retain a certain sympathy and he just couldn't do it.

Finney and Smith were both wonderful in their roles.  Finney's vindictive unforgiving parenting of Catherine is very true in my mind.  He is brutal, at times violently indifferent, yet it is apparent at times he is reaching for some common thread of understanding with the daughter he resents and despises.  His ultimate hypocrisy also sets Catherine free of any more fortun-hunting prospects as well as depriving the Slope dynasty of any hope of continuation.  He is just self-destructive enough to do it and be believable.

The costumes and production values of this film were beautiful but the cinematography was just plain weird at moments, with strange camera angles, and the soundtrack is very nice.

In comparison to ""The Heiress"" (starring Olivia de Haviland) I think ""Washington Square offered certain pros and cons.  I preferred WS's faithfulness to the story, which presents a more quiet triumph on Catherine's part as opposed to TH's more dramatic resolution.

936331,3,6304879482,"This adaptation, like 1949's *The Heiress*, is based on the Henry James novel. *The Heiress*, starring Olivia de Havilland, remains as a well-respected piece of work, though less true to James' original story than this new remake, which retains James' original title. It is the story of a awkward, yet loving daughter , devoted to her father after her mother dies during childbirth. The arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever, and considers her, as well as all women, simpleminded. When a young man of good family and little fortune comes courting, the Father is naturally suspicious, but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man, is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him. Leigh is a controversial actress - most either love her or hate her - and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style, like she's acting through gritted teeth. She's not bad in this, and she handles her role relatively deftly - it's just an awkward role for any actress, making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses. While the character garners a lot of sympathy, she's not particularly likable. The very handsome and immensely appealing Ben Chaplin (previously seen in *The Truth About Cats and Dogs*) plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune, or is really in love with her. Maggie Smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well-meaning aunt. Finney is marvelous, of course, as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience, but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves. But does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune? This is only one instance where *Washington Square* differs from *The Heiress*. Another instance is the ability to stick with it.

Now I bought a video of the film, to find the reason why this was neglected in our Japanese market.  Well, though I still don't know why, I think I can somehow understand the distributors' unwillingness to release this one.
Because the film is a mixed bag.  Not that ""Washington Square"" is a bad film.  On the contrary, I would rather like to praise it, but with some reservation.  First, remember, the story, based on one of James's earlier works of the same title, is a tragic one.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is Catherine Sloper, whose father (Albert Finney) is a respected doctor in New York City of the early 19th century.  Though Catherine is a good girl (morally, I mean), she is never praised as a beautiful girl, and she knows it, too.  Though her father Dr. Sloper is not cold-hearted, he is emotionally detached from his only daughter while she is desperately seeks for his approval.  Thus their life goes on at Washington Square in New York City.
Until a handsome man meets Catherine at a tea party, where he advances to her with a golden smile and skilled conversation.  He is Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin, ""Lost Souls""), who, it seems, lived a wild life in the past, but now, he says, is back as reformed.  Catherine falls in love for the first time in her life, and he says he is willing to marry her, but her father suspects that this young handsome guy is just a cad, good for nothing and after the money which she is to inherit after his  death.  But is he (doctor) really right in sternly rejecting him and his daughter's wish?
The story is melodramatic, but that is not the point.  Director Holland allows the actors to be characters they play, so that they realize the complicated relations which are subtlely described in the original book.  Certainly it is slow-moving, but if you pay attention not to the plot, but to the emotional changes happening in these people, you will enjoy the film.  After all, James is not famous for gripping storytelling; it is his characters and the relations between them that we care, and the film deserves our praise very much for the reason that it brought them to very real thing on screen.
But the praise is not unconditional, for there are some questionable decisions made in the film.  Holland rendered the piano recital scene a very embarrassing one (like ""The Exocist""), but that is totally unnecesary (and the original book does not have Catherine humiliated that way).  Casting is also strange.  Jason Leigh, herself very good, is, I am afraid, a bit miscast because Catherine should be, I thought, a little younger.  Ben Chaplin and Albert Finney are good, but Maggie Smith's meddlesome Mrs. Penniman, who gives some comic (but  slightly cruelly depicted) taste, looks uncomfortable.  Probably that is because we see her playing more serious, no-nonsense characters, as she did in ""Secret Garden"" ""Gosford Park"" and others.
Though this is not as good as William Wyler's ""The Heiress"", director Holland made a splendid job here.  Some of the camera work is also superb (see the sweeping movement of the opening scene), but sometimes her direction goes too far, as I pointed out.  But as a whole, a very good costume drama.",1040860800,19,3310,4.696707105719238

936348,5,6304879482,"Perhaps one of the most exasperating romances of all time and yet the subtle message throughout are delightfully entertaining. You are left to make up your own mind as to the true intentions of the characters.

This is the passionate story of a young heiress who is destined to choose between love and wealth. Her father (Albert Finney) disapproves of the man she loves and feels that if she marries a man who cannot take care of her, her mother died in childbirth in vain.

Morris Townsend (Ben Chaplin) is a handsome yet impecunious young man who sweeps her off her feet and shows her a world she longs to live in. Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is na've and shy and when she falls for Morris so fast, we can only assume she is consumed by his words, the stories he tells her and how he makes her laugh and feel about herself. She almost faints in his presence, so strong is the effect he has on her. He knows what a woman wants to hear.

""I never imagined I'd be taken like this...I heard tales of this, this thing. But I suspected it was an idea originated by mercenary novelists. Now I find myself, I find myself performing the most useless tasks in the hope that I'll find a moments respite from thinking of you. I'm quite overcome."" -Morris Townsend

Morris is determined to play the game of love and he wants to find the key that will
unlock the gate to Catherine's heart. Once he finds the key, he uses it to his advantage, all the while also wanting to find the key to her father's soul. When he fails to find a way to gain her father's approval, he starts to act irrationally and shallow.

Catherine's aunt seems to be living out her own fantasy of forbidden love and while she thinks she is working a magic love spell with the best of her intentions, she has in fact helped to concoct a strange and cruel curse.

When Morris shuts the door on Catherine's fantasy by saying he wanted her, but wanted her with her money, it is too cruel a fate. Did he mean what he said? Was he only mocking her controlling father who was impervious to pity.

Passionate with a powerful message of how strong women can be when looking into the eyes of a cruel fate. This is about a woman who gains confidence and some sense of satisfaction, yet loses what she wanted most, love.

936349,4,6304879482,"Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as Catherine Sloper,a clumsy,shy and innocent only daughter of Doctor Sloper(Albert Finney).  Her mother died at her birth and her father doesn't seem to like Catherine much.  Morris Townsend(Ben Chaplin)falls in love with her but he's not rich and her father starts to believe that Morris just wants to marry Catherine for her money.  If she marries Morris her father will disinherit her.  What will Catherine do?
  The performances of Jennifer Jason Leigh and the handsome Ben Chaplin are fine.  So is Albert Finney role as the strict father.  The music of the movie is beautiful.
 Though the ending was not what I expected,(I actually felt disappointed)I actually can say that I liked the movie(after I watched for the second time).  If you like period movies, like me, you should take a look at Washington Square.",986601600,20,844,4.964285714285714
936350,3,6304879482,"I saw an interview once with Jennifer Jason Leigh. I have never seen someone so boring and so utterly dull and personality-less on television. However, she imbues the characters she plays with real lives of their own, and I figure that is how she does it. She does not have a personality of her own, so she adopts the personalities of her characters and really makes a life for each of them. She is a superb actress in all of her roles, virtually disappearing in all of the roles. And she is no different in Washington Square, playing a dim-witted, none too attractive woman who stands to inherit her father's fortune when he dies. Her father (a lovely Albert Finney) disapproves of the relationship she begins with a man who appears to really love her for who she is. (This character is played convincingly enough, although stiffly, by Ben Chaplin). Indeed the story is an unhappy one based on a Henry James novel. Finney had been worried all along that Chaplin was only interested in his daughter for the money she stood to inherit, and it appears that Chaplin has pure intentions, but when it comes right down to it, he is greedy and wants her for her money. She ends up alone and does not inherit anything from her father (she has a modest inheritance from her mother's estate). Chaplin comes to visit her after many years apart, and she tells him simply never to return. It is rather painful to watch Jennifer Jason Leigh in this role because she plays pain so well.",985564800,3,1471,4.554716981132075
936351,5,6304879482,"This movie is undoubtedly one of the most dramatic in history. Unlike most other love stories, it ends on a sad note, but has an opening for pride in the future for it's innocent, heartbroken protagonist Catherine. The cast is very good (except for the young Catherine) and did a superb job acting. The costumes are perfect, the music is completely fitting. This movie is certainly worth seeing.",983404800,,395,4.823529411764706
936352,5,6304879482,"This film is worth watching for two things, mainly:
1. the acting
2. the music
Jennifer Jason Leigh embodies Catherine Sloper and gives us all she's got. I don't have words to express just how moving she is in this movie. Ben Chaplin doesn't disappoint either. He captures Morris's ambiguity and show us that Morris is capable of fine feelings, even if he is not strong enough to be a better man. Albert Finney is awesome. His cruelty plays off immensely well against Jennifer Jason Leigh's quiet growth in strength and self-awareness. Maggie Smith is both saddening and creepy. Terrific actress.
I loved this movie. I'd read the book before and loved it first. I find that the script doesn't do justice to James's intricate observations (it's virtually impossible) on society and human psyche, but, at the same time, whenever I think of Catherine Sloper and Morris Townsend from now on, I'll see Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ben Chaplin and feel moved all over again.
All I have to say about the music is that it's beautiful. Listen to ""Tu Chiami Una Vita"". It'll break your heart...in a good way.",981417600,7,1094,4.7631578947368425
936353,5,6304879482,"Washington Square is an engaging period piece, with wonderful performances to be had by Albert Finney, Maggie Smith, and Ben Chaplin. The only jarring note here is the performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who lacks subtlety and is so heavy handed as to be distracting.

This movie closely follows Henry James' novel of the same name.  Albert Finney plays a wealthy doctor, Austin Sloper, whose wife died giving birth to their daughter, Katherine, an only child raised by the imposing Doctor Sloper with the assistance of the Katherine's maternal, but silly and vapid Aunt Lavinia, beautifully played by Maggie Smith.
Katherine, a shy and clumsy child, desperately wanting, but lacking, affection from her imperious and distant father, grows up to be a plain faced, graceless, and awkward, young woman. As played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, she is a caricature rather than a fully fleshed character. Her portrayal of Katherine shows her lack of skill as an actress, especially when compared to the finely nuanced performances given by the other actors.

When this clumsy, plain jane is wooed by the dashing, but penniless young hunk, Morris Townsend, she falls hard and wants desperately to marry him. Silly Aunt Lavinia encourages the romance and aids and abets the lovers, curiously fulfilling her own romantic fantasies, while assisting her niece in fulfilling hers. Her father, however, pegs the handsome Mr. Townsend as a fortune hunter, because, he reasons, why else would Mr. Townsend want to marry his graceless lump of a daughter?

Needless to say, what follows is the cat and mouse game Dr. Sloper and Townsend play with each other, as well as with Katherine. Father threatens to disinherit daughter, and daughter swears she will marry suitor, despite father's threats. Suitor equivocates on the issue of whether disinheritance will cool his affections for Katherine. Does he do so out of love for Katherine or self interest? Suffice to say, while Katherine ends up finally getting some backbone in the end, one must ask who is the the ultimate victor in this drama. In my book, Father wins hands down and has the last laugh from the grave.

All in all, this is a handsome and, for the most part, well acted period piece that will be enjoyed by those who love this genre of film.",981244800,29,2285,4.955613577023499
