1870187,3,B00008YYV3,"Intrigued by the premise of the decadent 80s in LA [and all the star names associated with this movie], I decided to rent it. The result however was completely underwhelming, and left me feeling disappointed and annoyed at wasting my time on it. The movie plays out ala ""Crash"" in the sense that you have all these characters that are kind of linked with each other through certain circumstances. There's a Hollywood honcho [Billy Bob] who has a tumultuous and strained relationship with his wife [Kim Basinger] because of his dalliances with a newscaster [Winona Ryder]. His son [Jon Foster] is heavily involved in a world of sex and drugs, a world which includes his promiscuous girlfriend [Amber Heard]. There's a father-son pair who can't seem to connect with each other [Chris Isaak and Lou Taylor Pucci], a disillusioned rock star [Mel Raido], and a doorman [Brad Renfro, whose appearance in this movie was his last prior to his death] who is forced to put up with his con artist/criminal uncle [Mickey Rourke] and his nefarious activities [which include the kidnapping of minors].

The story arcs seem compelling, but they are never explored with any great level of depth, and the connection between these various arcs are at best, tenuous. I just felt underwhelmed by most of the performances - Billy Bob just seems to have this vacant expression on his face for most of the movie, Amber Heard's performance highlight was exposing her delectable bits and pieces, Brad Renfro blubbers throughout, and the list goes on. The exception was Kim Basinger who is actually quite compelling and credible in the role of the betrayed wife.

""The Informers"" tries its best to engage viewers' attention and elicit sympathy, but I felt emotionally disconnected from the major players, and felt the movie was shallow and under-developed in its' theme and characters portrayals. A rental at best.",1251590400,18,1888,4.9904761904761905
1870188,3,B00008YYV3,"In adapting his own novel, Bret Easton Ellis' The Informers depicts the hollow, self-obsessed world of early 1980s Los Angeles with enough vivid detail to keep you enthralled.  Among the denziens of The Informers are a Hollywood exec (Billy Bob Thornton) playing both his ex-wife (Kim Basinger) and his newscaster mistress (Winona Ryder), while his son (Jon Foster) finds himself among a group of young and privilaged who are in the thick of drugs and sex, including his girlfriend (Amber Heard).  Also on the plate here are an empty-souled rock star (Mel Raido), a distant father (Chris Isaak) and son (Lou Taylor Pucci), and a lonely belhop (Brad Renfro in his final film role) caught in a dangerous web with his amoral, ex-con uncle (Mickey Rourke).  While there is certainly to truly enjoy in The Informers, what the film does manage to accomplish is being an accurate enough adaptation of Ellis' own novel.  And, while the film is faithful, well-made, well-acted, and well-directed by Gregor Jordan, it ends up leaving the viewer feeling nearly as empty as the characters that it portrays, so much so that it'll leave you wondering just what the point of it all is.  Still, there have been worse adaptations of Ellis' work in the past, and in that regard, The Informers is certainly worth a look at the very least.",1251158400,7,1319,4.844444444444444
1870189,4,B00008YYV3,"...But I cannot quite put my finger on how to review the film content as highly. There has definitely been a split view out there on how good or bad this story worked in the 98 minutes it was given, and admittedly I felt a little shorted when the credits suddenly appeared. But as a Blu product, this did quite well.

The picture quality throughout was excellent, the night footage showed no grain in any sequence and the overhead city shots were succinct. There was only one sequence of sunlight bleeding the lens, otherwise all of the green screen shots were competent (and only after watching the making-of did I realize there were a few extra CGI shots I missed). There was such clean depth to the flesh tones (and there is a lot of flesh in this), that the make-up caking and flaws were unfortunately obvious. As a whole though, I loved watching a great clean picture. As always for a music laden film, I would have preferred DTS, but the TrueHD thumped through adequately and often - and I loved the music choices.

The main supplement is a 15 minute making-of that has some candid material from the cast and crew, and helped highlight some interesting film making tidbits (most of the film was in Uruguay, Billy Bob would not go there to film, the CGI/green screen usages, and so on). The commentary has Jordan's monologue plus two of the younger cast but he dominates the discussions with some good material.

The performances were filled with believable and some more solid than other attempts, and for it being Renfro's last film (died a week later) he showcased a fitting role to that end. For the most part I liked what everyone did, but there just was not enough time for any one role to stand up and take center stage (would have liked to see Chris Isaak and Mickey Rourke a bit more, but with 14 characters being covered, I now realize the much sought after extra forty minute version would be worth the time). Three and a half for the film and Blu clarity, 1/2 for the supplements, but once those credits popped up in that sudden last scene, I could not give it a five.

EDIT: One last thing I remembered, is that this film is actually represented perfectly by the red band trailer - and so few film trailers are accurate to the actual film. If you watch that trailer, and everything about the music montage and brief visuals look appealing, you just saw the film and you will probably like it.",1250812800,3,2410,4.508009153318078
1870190,5,B00008YYV3,"The Informers is a more awesome film than American Psycho and darker than Less than Zero. Brian Metro as the recount shows us how genuine acting and rock and roll is made, with all the requisite ingredients, and via insider trading. Chris Issack raises the baby spader with little effort, while Mickey Rourke works with a Brad Pitt fed looking person. It reveals how badly the current titanic generation is listing not to the left, but towards a middle size fits all. All the emotive water is there with the typical BEE sound scoring and lighting. Along with two other positive reviews from Roger Ebert and the San Francisco Chronicle, I consider this movie to be the great American geek filter. Again the actual film seems prescient with a 'nightmare' and a reference to January 15, miracle on the Hudson. What most negative reviews seem to miss, is how average the sex and drugs were of the era, and that 99% of us that indulged in great personal film making, are still rich and spoiled and extremely healthy and active today. Sure everyone is in a state of dread, but that's the price of creating such beautiful memories, it's not easy but it's worth it. The blue house. Today, you can have anything you want EXCEPT MEMORIES. Ask anyone today what they did last weekend and I'd be sure it's completely PG-13 rated laughable, and not what classical Zeus and Apollo surely paid to see. Winona Ryder is dressed perfectly like the first lady of the era, Nancy Rx.",1245974400,,1462,4.648648648648648

If you are a fan of the book i think that you should enjoy this film version, its not perfect but the tone and themes are present and that matters more than anything, to me at least.",1245110400,10,510,4.4361702127659575
1870192,2,B00008YYV3,"Despicable people doing reprehensible things can sometimes be entertaining, but The Informers fails to engage by examining too many characters, none of whom invoke any empathy, sympathy, pity, or any other emotion expected from a downward spiraling drama about lost souls amidst the `80s. Compounding this lack of intrigue is a storyline that is all introduction and setup, leaving the audience waiting for a third act that never comes. The Informers does dissect many of the clichs of the classes, but for all the sex, drugs, and rock `n' roll, there's still an overwhelming tediousness to such futile redemptions.

Multiple lives are explored during the early `80s, from the rich and famous to the desperate and despondent, all stripped bare by the unglamorous addiction to perpetual self-destruction. William (Billy Bob Thornton) is a powerful movie producer unfaithful to his equally adulterous wife Laura (Kim Basinger), and fickle in his decision to reunite with her as he pines for newscaster Cheryl (Winona Ryder). Their son Graham (Jon Foster) endlessly parties with his girlfriend Christie (Amber Heard) and their mutual friend Martin (Austin Nichols), though he is first to realize the loss of intimacy in their flagrant promiscuity. Lead singer of popular rock band The Informers, Bryan Metro's (Mel Raido) constant indulgence in mind-shattering decadency has all but eradicated his sense of morality. Tim (Lou Taylor Pucci) attempts to connect with his estranged father in a paradisiacal locale and hotel doorman Jack (Brad Renfro) must cope with a surprise visit from dangerous criminal Peter (Mickey Rourke). Though all are not immediately connected, every life examined shares a similar struggle to grasp the last shreds of humanity they have all but forsaken.

The Informers seems to say that indulgence in drugs, alcohol, sex and leisure can lead to a path of self-destructive horror. And for the wayward characters presented in the film that partake in an orgy of decadence, there is no hope for redemption or purification. It is nonstop free-spirited extravagance that bewitches the major parties in The Informers, and a sinking realization that order cannot be reacquired for the dysfunction that saturates the estranged families.

The whole film seethes with dark despondency, failing to present any comic relief or bright moments amongst the desperate criminals, unprotected lovers and uncontrollable rock stars. Rampant with random acts of debauchery, a total lack of supervision (which Graham practically begs for), and unexplainable violence, The Informers suffers from dire need of significance. With too many characters, representing the top and bottom of 1980's LA life, along with inconsequential dialogue and relations to fill in the gaps, the reasons behind any of the characters or their multiple narrative subplots is painfully obscure. Much is explored but nothing is explained. It is impressive, however, that the large cast of familiar faces agreed to participate in a film that struggles so desperately to get to the point.

1870403,2,B00008YYV3,"In glamorous L.A. during the early 1980s, bisexual drug dealer Graham (Jon Foster, this generation's Andrew McCarthy) thinks he might be in love with his girlfriend (Amber Heard), even while his girlfriend seems to be spending more time with their man-wh*re pal Martin, who sometimes joins the couple for three-ways. Graham's dad (Billy Bob Thornton), a studio exec, wants to get back together with Graham's mother but he can't quit his neurotic newscaster mistress (Winona Ryder, looking surprisingly frumpy as the other woman). Graham's mother (Kim Basinger) doesn't seem to know what she wants but she's sure she doesn't want to get back with her husband, instead whiling away her days in a medicated fog, occasionally breaking up the monotony of her existence with some afternoon sexing from Martin. In addition to Graham's screwed up family you have a boozy skirt chaser (Chris Isaak) trying -- and failing -- to bond with his son during a trip to Hawaii; a wasted rock star (Mel Raido) wreaking sexual havoc while on tour in L.A.; and, on the other side of the tracks, Brad Renfro, in his final film, as a pathetic doorman whose life becomes a whole lot more desperate when his criminal uncle (Mickey Rourke, almost upstaged by facial hair that resembles a fungal growth) shows up at his house with a teen girlfriend and kidnapped boy in tow.

Just from reading those story elements one might think ""The Informers"" is based on a Burt Hirschfeld novel. If only. Instead, the movie is based on a book of stories by Bret Easton Ellis, which means all this debauchery is slathered with generous helpings of self-loathing and ennui. Though not a sequel to Ellis' debut novel ""Less than Zero,"" the movie could just as easily be titled, ""Less than Zero 3: The Informers"" (""Less than Zero 2"" would be ""Rules of Attraction"").

Slickly directed by Gregor Jordan, ""The Informers'"" disjointed narrative, with all its sex, drugs and sleaze, should be more intriguing than it is. Supposedly this is satire, but it's a decidedly unfunny one. Parents are self-absorbed and immature; their neglected children are bored sociopaths. To say these characters are lost souls would imply they have souls to lose. Only Brad Refro's doorman seems to have any humanity, though to be fair Graham appears to at least *wish* he had feelings. In lieu of emotions, most characters in ""The Informers"" settle for sensations, be they from lines of cocaine or passionless sex (for all the beautiful naked bodies in this movie, the sex scenes are about as arousing as a deodorant commercial). It's telling that the only display of pure joy in the movie is when Graham makes a drug delivery to a music video shoot.

""The Informers"" isn't a bad movie so much as it's a pointless and dreary one. By the time I reached the final credits I felt as dead inside as its characters. It's a shame the vampire story thread from Ellis' book didn't make it into the movie; the actual undead might have livened up this parade of walking corpses.",1359504000,2,3001,4.823300970873786

Ellis is good at setting a pitch perfect tone and ambiance, but seemed to struggle with plot development early in his career, as evidenced by the brutally repetitive American Psycho - one of the few instances where the movie was better than the book. I am looking forward to the movie version of Lunar Park - Ellis' best novel, most emotionally resonant, and like a second but unrelated episode of Donny Darko.

This movie is brilliant setup with no payoff, no climax, and no conclusion. Still, compared with the majority of movies available, at least Informers got that much right. The Informers plays like an intriguing first 45 minutes of a good movie extended into an hour and 45.",1355184000,,759,4.75

We are in Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) land - LA in the early 1980s, with rich and privileged parents and their rich and privileged kids, all of whom are buff and beautiful, with virtually everyone overindulging in booze, drugs, and sex (hetero-, homo- and bi-) in various combinations and permutations. Since Ellis did the screenplay he has no one to blame but himself for the film's complete lack of focus. The acting ranges from okay to pretty good, with the exception of Billy Bob, who seems to be sleepwalking through the whole film (or is he supposed to be always drugged up?). The film takes place just as AIDS was coming into people's consciousness, and one of the characters, indeed, has obviously contracted the disease, so are we supposed to take this film as a warning of what unchecked hedonism leads to? If so, it doesn't work, because all the characters are so superficial that it is impossible to care about any of them. The Informers (and I guess I'm just not with it, but I have no idea what the title is supposed to mean) might have worked as a collection of individual short stories loosely tied together by a common theme (think of Robert Altman's vastly superior Shirt Cuts), but here, at least, that loose connection just doesn't work cinematically.",1341964800,,1791,4.707006369426751

It is certainly a throwback to the 80s and will therefore be somewhat nostalgic for those of us who grew up during that era.

Instead, there are a bunch of sub-plots which rub against each other.  However, unlike CRASH, where the stories made a seamless whole, to me the disparate stories in this movie made the storyline seem disjointed and a bit chaotic.  There are also disturbing images of violence against women & children which are thrown in for no good reason.

Of course, seeing Amber Heard dance around topless is worth several times the price of admission.

1) The drug-dealing college protagonist Graham Sloan and his sexy (and more than not topless) girlfriend Christy who is sleeping with his friend Martin (who Graham is also sleeping with)

2) William and Laura Sloan (Graham's parents) who are trying to ""reunite"" the family while William is actively lusting after his old mistress Cheryl Moore (Winona Ryder).  The daughter - Susan Sloan - is supposed to be providing the only moral voice of this dysfunctional group - but she is so annoying I found her to be sort of disposable. The talent of Billy Bob Thornton and Kim Basinger are almost completely wasted in these roles, as is Wynona Ryder.

3) Mickey Rourke as ""Peter"" in an absolutely pointless kidnapping and ransom subplot whose only tie to the previous two is as a hotel attendant at Christy's apartment (what's his name? who cares....).  I cannot for the life of me figure out why this plot is even part of this movie.  Maybe the book makes that more clear - I don't know.

4) Another pointless subplot about a debauched rock star with an estranged wife and kid who snorts coke (in a movie like this.... who doesn't?) abandons his band in the middle of a concert (nobody notices) and hops into bed with 2 underage groupies.  His tie to the rest of the movie?  The estranged wife is friends with Christy - apparently....

5) A father (played by Chris Isaak - another wasted talent) tries to make amends to his son by taking him to Hawaii for some sun & fun.  In what promises to be another uplifting moment, the son tells the father that there is no chance for him to earn his forgiveness for some crime that goes unspecified.  The son is friends with Graham.

Whatever this movie was intended to be, it comes across instead as a patchwork of messy situations that are a joyless for us to experience as they are for the characters.  It seems that by assembling an all-star cast and putting together a great soundtrack, the producers were hoping that they could overcome the movie's less logical elements through sheer stylistic determination, but they fail dreadfully.

What you have here instead is nothing more or less than a car crash that ends with (spoiler alert - for those who have no predictive capabilities) one of the main characters dying with aids.  When the end credits started to role, the only thing on my mind was the question of why they made this movie as it offers nothing new to the genre - essentially a form of pornography for those obsessed with misery brought on by moral depravity.

If you're looking for movies about the horrific results of excess through the eternal search for short-term gratification, here are a few superior alternatives I could suggest off the top of my head -

1) Requiem for a dream - just as depressing but infinitely more true.
2) Trainspotting
3) Kids
4) Blow",1303516800,,3264,4.610726643598616
1870456,2,B00008YYV3,"""Adjust my dreams for me."" It's a short phrase, but can be interpreted in so many ways. Some people may find it a lazy request; some may see it as the catch-phrase of drug culture; others may see it as the words of a talented writer telling his future self to change the names, places, and most of the activities of a novel in order to make it even more confusing as a movie.

  Introducing, The Informers.

  For better or for worse, ""adjust my dreams for me"" is the main character's cry for salvation from what his life has become in the Bret Easton Ellis book-turned-movie, The Informers. Unfortunately, the rest of the story is so messy that you feel that some of the plot-lines should have been made into short films.

  In Bret Easton Ellis' book of the same name, you are given a multitude of short story-type chapters, where characters are cross referenced in those chapters and even in other Ellis books. What is created is literary confusion, as most of the characters are part of an elite troupe of the LA scene and, with one exception, everyone is about sex, drugs and rock n' roll. The movie is much like the book, except the names are traded around to make someone like me who has read the book even more confused. Half the time I was watching The Informers, I was pausing and referencing the book to figure out who the hell is who.
  To summarize, the movie is about a dead playboy, a kid and his estranged drunken father, a separated couple in the midst of faking a reunion, a guy fed up with sleeping around and having his girlfriend sleep around(specifically with the guy's best friend. There's a nifty post-threesome scene), an out of work actor and his convict uncle, and a confused rockstar. The stories interwine with each other throughout the movie as the characters try to find some peace. Or, something. Whatever it is, no one finds it. Not exactly the feel good movie of the year.

  The acting isn't half-bad. Mickey Rourke steals the show with the minimal screen time he has as Uncle Pete, the loving soul that sells kids into sex slavery, along with since deceased Brad Renfro as an out of work actor trying to do the right thing no matter what the cost. In a better world, this could have been the next Another Day In Paradise, but instead it is just part of The Informers. Billy Bob Thornton and Kim Bassinger play very well as a separated couple trying to patch their life back up. Unfortunately, their story doesn't measure up to what is going on in the rest of the movie.

  Amber Heard, playing Christie, is naked for half the movie, which is awesome, but her interaction with her boyfriend, Graham, and his best friend are perfect in allowing Graham to get to that point where he's had enough, but just can't seem to break away from the cycle that his life has become. In the final scene of the movie, Graham goes to Christie as she's sick, lying on the beach. The interaction is intense when Graham meets Nina, the woman who called him to get Christie:

Graham: ""Why me?""

Nina: ""Well aren't you the one that loves her?""

Graham: ""What's that gonna fix. Is that gonna help her?""

  It's not really going to help anyone in this movie, but as a hammer to the head as a realization that these characters will never get out of their own ways, it helps us as the audience, and somewhat saves this movie.

  The story-line of the rockstar Bryan Metro is so stereotypical it barely makes a dent. Think Trent Reznor rumors right before ""The Downward Spiral"" was released.

  In fact, the only really bad actor in the movie was Chris Isaak as a drunken father. Sure, he seemed drunk, forcefully, annoyingly drunk. Maybe he really was drunk because his acting was even worse sober. Who knows?

  So does one actor ruin a movie? No. What killed this movie was  too much content, and not enough depth. Ellis got away with having multiple storylines co-existing. He had a lot of space to play with in the book. But in a movie, we have 2 hours. While it can be done(like in Crash), it needs a distinct story to keep it moving, and a balance of cuts as me are movied from story, and unfortunately, this movie was lacking both of these.

  I'd go as far as to say that the story of Graham and Christie and the story of Uncle Pete and Jack could easily have been great as short films, or even as feature films. I'd go as far as o say that these two stories could have co-existed together in this film if only the rest of the film was cut.

Laced with well known actors (Mickey Rourke, Billy Bob Thornton and Kim Bassinger) this is a disturbing look on life amongst rich in 1980s LA.  Music, clothes, drugs and parties are all around.  People are as beautiful as they can be in southern California.  But they are also insatiable in their appetites for everything else.  In their cruelty, all is fair because they simply cannot distinguish good from evil.

The complexity of familiar relations, superficiality of friendship, promiscuity at its saddest and life seemingly wasted are all around.

1870460,5,B00008YYV3,"Firstly, I'm shocked by the amount of negative reviews I've seen for this film. It seems as though everyone has missed the point entirely.

THIS FILM IS A SATIRE. So saying its a glorification of decadence is absurd.

Second of all, this film is not about plot - it's a character study.

Yes, this is a film about the selfish, narcissistic L.A. scene and the people who inhabit it. And no, this film is not attempting to glorify the lifestyle these characters lead. The film is a warning, a modern morality tale. This film could have just as easily been set in ancient Rome. In the book, it's clear that Christie is HIV positive, and of course, the implication is that everyone she's slept with, as well as everyone that has slept with everyone she has is positive as well. Hardly a glorification of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Everyone in this film is lonely, desperate, and lost and will most likely soon be dead. A sequel to this film would depict the characters are wasting away from AIDS in their expensive private hospital rooms. Nothing good comes from the way these characters act, so how can this be a glorification?

Ellis, like in American Psycho and Gramorama, is not trying to glamorize this lifestyle, he's attempting to satirize and criticize the people it creates. I'm frankly surprised that all can't see that. And The Informers does this very well. It shows us people that are difficult to like and even easier to hate. Towards the end of the film, the viewer isn't sure if these characters are to be pitied or laughed at. We're not sure if we should be appalled or fascinated. And that's the point. The Informers"" is  not a film about ""sex, drugs, and rock and roll, European-style"" (as an actor who plays Graham from the movie so eloquently puts it in the commentary). Rather, it's a film about beautiful people doing awful things. Why? To hi-light the moral decay that exists in our culture. To shock us into change. Bret Easton  Ellis, a self-professed ""moralist"", is making a statement; beauty is only skin-deep and decadence will lead to your downfall.

Also, despite the social commentary, this is one hell of a beautiful film.

Perhaps what is so disturbing for people and why this film is so harshly criticized is because of what it does. It holds a mirror up to the viewer and you won't necessarily like what you see. There are no heroes in this film. Only moral decay, desperation, apathy. People who lack in a moral compass and need guidance. There is no catharsis and no ""happy ending."" There is no resolution. You are only left with your thoughts.

At its heart, this interlocking web of shorts is really about the complex and fragile dynamics between fathers and sons. As the actor who plays Tim says it's a ""relationship piece"" and I agree.

Now, that said, being a big fan of Ellis' work myself, this film disappoints as the ""adaptation"" it claims to be. For one thing, in the book, Bryan Metro is a vampire, and there is no suggestion of this in the film. Also, the film downplays the effect of AIDS on the characters, which is of course the main ""concequence"" of these character's grotesquely decadent lifestyles. In the film, it is implied that Christie is dying of AIDS, while in the book it is made clear. arguably the antagonist, its her decadence that brings about the demise of everyone around her.

Perhaps it`s this line that encapsulates the film in a way; ""you can't make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things. And you know, I'm willing."" And this is the beauty of film. WE would never do such things, but it's thrilling to watch these ""fake"" people on screen do them.

The irony - a common device in Ellis' work - is how these beautiful people are doing awful things to each other. It's interesting that the director said that for this film he was inspired by Italian movies from the 1970s, depicting beautiful people in terrible situations. The themes of decadence, hedonism and the price of that lifestyle fit well with the ominous soundtrack and dark tone the film used.

""The Informers"" is more than another 80s noir period film with a killer soundtrack featuring beautiful naked young people doing drugs. That is the surface of this film. The purpose, the ""message"" dare I say, goes far deeper than that and is based on how you choose to interpret this film and the book it is based on. We are not meant to laugh at these people, despite how lost and clueless they are, we're meant to pity them, and loathe the parents who made them the way they are. As Graham tearfully explains to Martin, he needs someone to tell him ""what's good and what's bad"" and asks how he's supposed to know if no one ever told him.

On the surface, The Informers is a fascinating film on its own merit. It falls short as a successful adaptation of Ellis' book, though.",1278115200,,4832,4.584009269988412
1870520,2,B00008YYV3,"This is a movie about the decadent 1980s.  The main plot, focusing on a group of rich young adults, is very good.  It gets it right what is like to be rich and spoiled and what the excesses of drugs and sex were like in the 1980s.

What is bad are the subplots dealing with the adults.  These subplots do not enhance the movie or have anything to do with the 1980s.  These subplots could happen at any time.  There's the cheating husband and there is the creep kidnapping children and there is the rock musician over endulging in drugs and underage girls.  These things have happened in every decade.

The biggest problem with this movie is the timelines of the all the subplots.  The movie keeps jumping from one subplot to another, but the timescale isn't the same for the subplots.  The main one with the young adults plays over months, while some of the others are only 2 days long.  This is just plain sloppy film making.",1275782400,,926,4.420118343195266

Based on my limited interactions with these ""Movers and Shakers"" I would say the atmosphere and/or mood depicted in this movie was accurate. While I was backcountry skiing and/or backpacking in the Pioneer/Sawtooth/Danskin mountains or whitewater kayaking on Payette/Boise/ Salmon river(s)... these movers and shakers were doing some very different moving and shaking.

1870522,1,B00008YYV3,"What a mess!

This film reminded me of Jay McInterney's novel (later a film), BIG LIGHTS, BRIGHT CITY, another story of 1980s decadence.  Except that that book was coherent, and the lead character, while initially annoying, became sympathetic toward the end.

But THE INFORMERS is a mess.  A film about mostly twentysomething white guys, and a few gals, living decadent lives in Los Angeles, on the fringes of the movie and music businesses.  Also some divorced middle-aged folks (none happily married) preying on the young, and on each other.

This film tries SO HARD to shock us.  But it's tough to shock an audience these days.  The film's overkill approach only makes us feel contempt for these characters.

One young guy is run over by a car. His friends are callous at the funeral.

A divorced dad takes his son to Hawaii.  Then dad flirts with the son's date, and mocks his own son in other to impress the date.  This young woman actually responds, preferring dad to son!  Sleazy dad, shallow woman.

There's the divorced rock star who sleeps with underage kids of both sexes, at the same time.  He awakes from a drugged stupor, finds the kids in his bed, and, having finished with them, calls security to toss the kids into the hall.

There's the aspiring actor.  His uncle, who sexually abused the actor when the actor was a child, shows up with a kidnapped child that he plans to sell to drug lords.

There's the obligatory AIDS victim.  A young druggie girl who has a strange new sickness which baffles everyone.  We know she will die.  I guess this is meant to be poignant, but we don't get to know her, and can't admire what little we do see.  Filmmakers have to realize that giving a character AIDS does not automatically confer sympathy.

Everyone's drinking, doing drugs, divorced, cheating on their significant other. But apart from the shallow, vain, low-life, creepy characters, the film is further hampered by the story -- there isn't any.

There are so many characters, the film couldn't provide meaty story arcs for any of them.  We see only brief sketches, dropping in on one creepy character after another.  We see them betraying, drugging, drinking, and abusing one another, then it's on to the next low-life.  Mostly rich low-lifes, but low-lifes nonetheless.

What's the point of this ""slice of life,"" lacking any story or characters of interest.  Is the filmmaker telling us, ""But it's real!  People like this exist!""

Yeah, we know.  Films (and reality TV shows) have shown us that for decades.  Such ""slices of life"" are no longer enough.  Your film has to do more.

Winona Ryder, once again, has only a tiny cameo.  She's not had many significant roles this decade, and has appeared in mostly  bad films.  A few okay films, but mostly bad.",1274054400,5,2770,4.741596638655462

If you watch carefully the first five minutes of the movie, the rest of it just expands upon it: at a glitzy Los Angeles party, one of its attendees gets run over by a car. It is, in effect, a wake up call to the rest of the attendees that the party has to end some time, and it may not be in a way you like. The rest of the film takes its ensemble and gives them each a wake up call. Some of them respond to it so as to make you think they might make something out of themselves and others do not.

To be honest, I hate that; if you're going to foreshadow the whole movie in five minutes, then what's the point of the rest? You're just wasting the moviegoers' time. But I will give the makers credit for faithfully recapturing the look of the 80's. It was a nice trip down Memory Lane.

I don't pretend to be familiar with Ellis' work, as I've never read a book by the man and I've only seen two film adaptations of his work. One was American Psycho, the other The Rules of Attraction. The Informers is the first film adaptation that Ellis had a hand in, co-writing the script with Nicholas Jarecki. It's a period piece of sorts, set in Los Angeles in 1983 among the Hollywood scene. It's got an all-around reliable cast including Billy Bob Thornton, Kim Basinger, Mickey Rourke, Winona Ryder, Rhys Ifans, and the late Brad Renfro...How can this be a bad film?

They're all engaged in drinking, sex, and soon one of their friends is struck by a vehicle and killed. At his funeral, only one of his friends reacts and the others seem indifferent. ""Bruce was an [...],"" says one character. This is a film filled with character's that are indifferent to their lives and the world as a whole. Graham (Jon Foster) is the son of studio head William (Thornton) and Laura (Basinger), who just lounges around her home occasionally having sex with Graham's friend Martin (Austin Nichols). It's not uncommon for Graham to wake up next to his girlfriend Christie (Amber Heard) and Martin. Meanwhile Jackson (Renfro), an aspiring actor and hotel courtesy clerk, is confronted by his Uncle Pete (Rourke), a despicable man who tells Jackson he has a plan and doesn't allow Jackson to object.

The film has interweaving storylines, obviously, including one about a drugged-out rock star Bryan Metro (Mel Raido) and one of Graham's friends Tim Price (Lou Taylor Pucci) who is forced to travel to Hawaii with his estranged father (Chris Isaak), who frequently asks him if he's gay. When Tim actually meets a girl there, his father hits on her.

It runs a mere 98 minutes and has too many storylines going to really do any of them justice. Apparently, the original novel had more (including one with vampires), but a novel's a novel. The film simply doesn't really flesh out any of these character's nor does its running time allow it enough time to do so...And, as many people have mentioned already, the characters are not sympathetic. The performances here are good all around, but none of the character's have any depth for the actor to work with. The only sympathetic character here is Jackson and the performance by Renfro makes one realize how tragic a loss this was for movies. Renfro plays Jackson as a troubled young man, afraid of his Uncle Pete and the man's actions...This character doesn't seem like a deep, multi-layered character but it's not an easy part to play. Watch the scene where Jackson tries to tell the blonde man who arrives at his apartment that he doesn't know what the man is talking about. That's acting, folks.

As I said, the performances are good here but not a single one (except Renfro's) really makes any connection with the audience. Without feeling something for the characters, you don't really care what happens to them. This complaint of mine goes along with other's complaint about the abrupt ending...It does end abruptly, with little optimism for anyone involved. This didn't bother me very much, but it would've been much less bothersome if the character's had been fleshed out before the ending. While I don't want to exclude Basinger and Thornton, Mickey Rourke is fun to watch here. I love Rourke and I always enjoy seeing him play the sweaty, charismatic-in-a-dirty-way character with his hair lazily slicked back. Rourke has that charisma that he mixes with subtle threatening overtones. It's nothing Award-worthy, but a fun performance.

The film does capture the `80s vibe very well and credit should be given to director Gregor Jordan for capturing an era that isn't the easiest to capture on film without going into self-parody territory. I would not call The Informers a waste of time, but the poor characterization and predictable dialogue (there's some dialogue in this film where you know exactly what the character's are going to say to each other) bog it down. It's certainly not ""one of the worst movie's of this or any year"" as Peter Travers branded it.

My advice to you is approach The Informers without expecting American Psycho or a masterpiece. The Informers is entertaining enough; it'll pass the time, but it's nothing special nor is it anything memorable.

1870588,2,B00008YYV3,"Tried to watch this movie 4 times. It is really boring and not engaging at all.  There are some hot chicks in it getting naked, but even those scenes aren't acted too well.  Pass this one up unless you are super bored.",1254787200,,218,4.166666666666667
1870629,4,B00008YYV3,"As I began watching this movie, the immeidate parallel that I drew was ""Less Than Zero.""  I didn't know until it was over, and googled the cast, that I found out that it was written by the same guy.  Very similar in mood.

In fact, I think the mood is more the point of the movie than anything else, and in that respect I can testify for it's accurate portrayal since I was exactly the age of characters at exactly that time.  The dress, the look, the ""searching"", the feel of opulent loneliness, or exquisite desperation...  It really did feel exactly like that in the early to mid eighties club scene.

Others have criticized the story line for being shallow, but hey, we were shallow.  There were a couple of places that I thought seemed a bit ""contrived"", but even those mirrored some of my own sentiments from that time.  I'm speaking of one instance where two of the guys are talking, and one of them is beginning to question his lifestyle and the other is definately not.  He begins talking how he needs ""someone to tell him what's right and what's wrong..."" and I'm thinking, ""Well, that came out of nowhere...""  But when I look back, I did a lot of the same questioning myself, after coming home from a night on the beach clubs.

The movie is a series of pretty much independent character stories, in the same sort of vein as ""Crash"", but without the obviously clear connections between all the characters.  They seem less connected to each other than in Crash.  I'm not sure what Renfro's and Rourke's characters had to do with anything, though, and that whole plot line could  have been dropped from the movie entirely with no sense of loss at all.  Not sure what they were there for other than to perhaps lend a hand to the feeling of depression which I think this movie is intentionally trying to create.  Same for Bassingers and Thornton's character line.

In fact, so independent are the stories from each other that you could drop almost any of them with no noticeable impact.  The movie is the sum total of it's parts, but the sum would certainly be a bit less with any of them missing.  Altogether, they create an ""air"" of emptiness, loathing and desperation that really were the mood of 80's nightlife.  ""To Live and Die in LA"" has the same sort of grittiness to it.

What will help you survive this movie is to look at it differently than you are accustomed to. If you go in expecting the characters introduced at the beginning are going to be redeemed by the end, you will be disappointed.  If you expect this to be a movie where all the knots are untangled by the end, where the rough edges are made smooth, the dillemas resolved, and harsh reality eased and made more bearable... you will be disappointed.  This movie goes the other way and makes the smooth edges rough - the closing scene is particularly jagged.

Also of note is the soundtrack.  It includes a lot of the ""big names"", but it's nice to see a movie about the 80s that doesn't neglect to remind you that there was lots of music on the scene other than ""Flock of Seagulls"".  The soundtrack includes a lot of the other 99% of songs that never really made it to the Top Ten.  This has the effect of intensifying the feeling of authenticity.  You recall the music being like that, but not necessarily who did it.  And that's the way 80's music really was.  It was ubiquitous yet largely unknown; extremely transient.  The only thing I can think of conspicuously missing is any reference to Miami Vice, although a character in the opening scene is dressed much like Don Johnson just before he gets killed.

SPOILER!

The sex is gratuitous and I could have done with less - a LOT less, in fact.  But I think it may have been made excessive, but not specifically gratuiotous.  I think there was a reason: it was to make a very hard impact on the closing scene.  The dying Christie, laying on a cold, sunless beach, pale, ravaged now with AIDS.  And on her pale, bruised covered thigh, a fly lands and crawls about for a while, while her former lover looks at her.  This is the same beautiful body we were seeing before, now only weeks later cold and nearly dead with flies crawling on it.  The contrast between soft and beautiful, and diseased and infected, on the same skin in so short a period of time.  That really was a bit of a shock.",1254182400,23,4320,4.453503184713376

1870632,5,B00008YYV3,"I almost never review anything anymore, but I'm reviewing the motion picture adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' THE INFORMERS because I honestly believe it was treated patronizingly, haphazardly and unfairly by most professional film critics.

THE INFORMERS--the movie--is an unusually faithful adaptation of the collection of stories upon which it is based.  I consider ""The Informers"" a novel, but Ellis considers it a collection of short stories.  In any event, the film certainly looks exactly like I imagined it would look.  There are minor changes here and there, and the absurd vampire stuff is omitted (mercifully) because it would have stood out as atonal and conspicuous.

The fiction of Bret Easton Ellis is clearly an acquired tasted.  Initially, I loathed it, but after time it began to grow on me and I feel he has the knack for capturing what was so titillating, repulsive, appealing, magnetic, compulsive, empty, vacuous, frightening and true about that period between 1981 and 1990.

I suspect, and I may be wrong, that most critics who detest the movie THE INFORMERS neither read the book upon which it is based nor like the novels by this author anyway.

Bottom line, for me:  This movie is faithful in tone and spirit to the novel and waddles unapologetically in precisely the type of deadpan, vicious, fierce satire at which Easton excels.  Yes, it is at times painful, loathesom, horrifying.  And the tone oscillates to include the broader satire of his work, as illustrated by the father and son trip to Maui, punctuated with flashes of extreme sincere pain.  Note Kim Basinger's performance.

In truth, the movie is actually kinder and gentler than the book.

It would be interesting to read the critiques of readers who ""get"" Ellis' work and see if their opinions vary drastically from the conventional talking points about this film constituting an utter failure.

Admittedly, it is by no means a perfect film--and it would perhaps have benefited from being longer--but it is far, far better than most of the reviews would lead you to believe.  You want to see an awful adaptation of an Ellis novel?  Check out LESS THAN ZERO.  The only thing the movie and novel have in common is the title.

In addition, I highly recommend the collection of stories upon which it is based, the original book ""The Informers.""

As an afterthought, I am shocked to see people actually asking ""What is this film about?""  Is it not obvious what it is about?

I mean, really.",1253664000,14,2478,4.90625
1870633,1,B00008YYV3,"This Short Attention Span Summary will seem a bit disconnected, but that is because the movie was the same way. Plot spoilers.

Short Attention Span Summary:

1. The movie opens with someone being hit by a car. No explanation.
2. Later on, we see people engaged in various sexual acts. There is a Decadent Rock Star that seems to have sex with anything that moves (of either sex). At one point, he wakes up in bed with two teenagers and calls the security guards to get them out of his bed.
3. Later still, a Bad Guy (Mickey Rourke) looks up his brother/ friend/ acquaintance (he has with him some strung out girl that is tagging along). The Bad Guy kidnaps a child to sell him to some people who plan to do some ungodly things (we are never clear on who the people are or what they plan to do).
4. Some woman who is in some relationship with some person/ people apparently has HIV (this is before they quite knew what the disease was-- so it is only hinted at). Eventually her lover meets her laying on the beach (not lucid) and kisses her and leaves here there.
5. The Decadent Rock Star one night comes back to his hotel room to find his wife sitting there. He kisses her then punches her. We are later told that someone is holding his wife hostage with a gun (and presumably it is Decadent Rock Star), but this plot line was never resolved or explained in any way during the movie.
6. There is some young man in some bad relationship with his father. The young man finds women and his father steals them from him. There is some type of hostility in the relationship, but we don't know its genesis.
7. There is some diabetic husband (Thornton) that has a wife that is strung out on prescription medication (Basinger) that he wants to come back to him (all the while having a piece on the side).

Review: I honestly just don't know what this movie is about. Even in the worst case scenario of movies (I've seen a lot of bad movies), I can say that the movie will be worth it if it goes onto the dollar shelf. But this movie isn't even that promising (because you would have to spend the time that it took to go get it).

The plots overlapped, but were not developed. For that matter, they seemed to start in the middle of the story and just run until the movie ended, with no resolution. (And any one of these subplots, taken on its own and developed, could have made a good film that showcased the Decadent 80s.) Perhaps there were some plot details that were too esoteric for most viewers to get. But after it was all said and done, I just ended up confused.

This movie is awful. Save your time. The single best part was the shocking hairstyles that were in vogue in the 80s. But we can look at any VH1 I Love the 80s to see the same thing for free-- and even hear a good song or two while snickering at the hairstyles.",1253404800,3,2824,4.2611940298507465

The only reason I left it playing as long as I did was because my cat was in my lap and I didn't want to disturb her; unfortunately that exposed me to more creepy, violent, pointless unpleasantness than anyone should have to absorb in one sitting.

This is a pretty pointless movie about how shallow the 80's were. There is sex, violence, drugs and some bad behavior in this, but the plot is so pointless you just don't care and feels like a waste of time. The only good part about this movie is when it shows Amber Heard naked, but after those few scenes the rest of it is some more shallow and boring stuff. Besides Amber Heard naked, the awkwardness of the film got a bit of my attention especially from the beginning but that is about it, didn't live through the 80's nor do I care, maybe someone who did might enjoy it or people that are fans of the book. But I doubt even that, just about shallow people being connected to one another in some way.

I don't look at these characters as immoral (Save For Mickey Rourke's Character) so much as I view them as amoral (meaning Neither Moral Nor Immoral).
This movie encapsulates the 1980s better than any other film I've ever seen. It goes straight at you and it does not apologize. In the behind the scenes of the film they say it is sex, drugs and rock and roll all the way. And it certainly is. I'm about 10 years or so younger than the central characters in this film but I can honestly say that I'd have loved to party with graham and Martin and Christie. Lou price seems to be a spoiled brat who unnecessarily ignores his Father (Although I Admit His Dad is Not Blameless for The Estrangement). the other characters are superfluous to the whole film. while others are shocking. mickey Rourke's character frightens me as do most of his roles.

Graham is the central character and he and his friends are the protagonists of this fine film. I like that the writer of the book also did the screenplay. this permitted the film to be entirely his own vision without any tampering from a hired screenwriter.

There are people who complain about the sex and drugs shown in this film. Come on, people! This was the 1980's! Almost everybody did some blow in those days (Many Do Today). The fact is that in those party cultures people imbibe and snort and screw to their hearts content. As a fellow named Kirby Wallace said, the film is the sum of all of its parts. while the scenes of the main characters work conterminously with one another, the story arcs also would work independently of one another. That's the genius of the writer.

I give this film Four and a Half Stars. I'm the 92nd person to review it and the 17th to give it a Five Star review. I recommend this film and want you to know that it is not for children. The sex is intense as is the drug abuse. If one is from the conservative south or Midwest I recommend that you stay away from this film or you will be shocked.
