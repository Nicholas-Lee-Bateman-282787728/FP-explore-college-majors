8020043,5,B00021MZUU,This was my first Charles Dance film - and I was thrilled to be able to find it again!  Holds its own with our most recent spy thrillers!!,1238976000,,138,3.9285714285714284

Whatever, the film has a lot of style to it, but - warning - the lead character - Charles Dance playing ""Paul Hatcher"" - is unappealing.  The script also is a bit talky for a suspense thriller. It needed more action. It had an interesting premise: a movie critic who spies on his neighbors, gets caught and strange things then happen. ""Hatcher"" starts confusing reality with movie fiction. Without giving anything away, he winds up on the hit list of mobsters.

As I said, it's a strange film. Frankly, I'd like to see it again, this time with a good DVD transfer.

By the way, the definition of McGuffin - as used in film - is ""a plot device that has no specific meaning or purpose other than to advance the story; any situation that motivates the action of a film either artificially or substantively.",1237420800,,877,4.4625
