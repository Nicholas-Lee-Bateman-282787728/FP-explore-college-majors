8072799,5,B000A2WSSK,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves Arthur and his many different adventures.

What I specifically really liked about these three episodes are that they all center around Arthur's wonderful grandma, Thora.

It's funny how a kid never looks at an adult as a child (what you see is what you get) and that is what makes this episode great for me.  It gives Arthur perspective that maybe his grandmother isn't just a grandmother.  She is definitely something more especially when she teaches him about marbles.

Now, coincidentally a couple days before my daughter Shayna watched this show, my dad told my daughter about how to play with marbles.  So lo and behold, this video completely held her attention.

This volume presents three episodes all centered on Arthur's grandmother, Thora. In ""Arthur Loses His Marbles,"" grandson and grandmother compete against each other in a marbles' tournament.  In ""Half-Baked Sale,"" Arthur tries to prevent Thora from submitting her cookie recipe to the school bake sale.  In ""Clarissa is Cracked,"" Arthur's little sister, D.W., damages Thora's porcelain doll.

I only wish the DVDs were longer (three 15 minute videos aren't enough in my opinion) but you can't go wrong if you can get them at a good deal.

...And this dvd definitely should not be rated two stars (if you read the only other review about Arthur on this particular product). It is a great dvd in my opinion.  So I felt the need to publish my first review.",1204761600,3,1454,4.842105263157895
8072800,2,B000A2WSSK,"Like most children's shows, this cartoon (and ""DW Blows the Whistle"") explores important life lessons: don't be a tattle-tale, remember safety first, it's OK to be sad if you don't get invited to a party, etc.

But Arthur, who is a third-grader, and his little sister DW, a 4-year-old, are really mean to each other. And although it's normal for 4-year-olds to pitch tantrums, DW exhibits a lot of ""smart-allecky"" behavior.

Needless to say, I'm not a fan of children's movies that portray rotten attitudes and bratty behavior and then say ""don't act like that, that's naughty."" I prefer the cartoons like Franklin and Little Bear that show the characters being thoughtful and kind to each other in the first place. I realize that's not real life all the time, but my son will learn this behavior soon enough. I don't need a video teaching him.

All to say, ""Arthur"" is not for toddlers. It's, at best, suited for older kids who can pick up on the ""older-kid lessons."" But regardless of age, I think there are better, more positive videos out there to choose from.",1137715200,2,1064,4.709677419354839
