8416201,3,B0044LYRF0,"Ted Mikels vision is the same today as it was in the 60's. He and his sci-fi,tongue & cheek B-movies are just as timeless today as they were decades ago. The Astro-Zombie series,in my opinion,is Ted's way of saying,""I'm alive and well just doing my thing"".Get your sci-fi on Mr. Mikels and we'll look forward to your next release.",1352764800,2,330,4.610169491525424
8416202,1,B0044LYRF0,"The first in the series is worth a watch. The second is rather bizarre but this one, stay away. Ted V. Mykel has definitely lost his touch with time. He continues to create terrible sequels that are attached to his classics that just diminishes his original genius. Stick with Ted's 60's material. This is one to stay away from.",1331510400,2,328,4.576271186440678
