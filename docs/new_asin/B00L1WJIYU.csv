6461554,4,B00L1WJIYU,Really far fetched.  Saw a lot of the same effects as in other syfy movies - Independence Day only in the ocean kind of thing- but it was fun.  Fun loving bad boy saves the day and gets the girl sort of movie.  So if you like that kind of syfy and don't expect big budget block busters you might like this.,1411084800,2,306,3.903225806451613

6461559,2,B00L1WJIYU,"Within the opening seconds of BERMUDA TENTACLES, the president (John Savage- ALL THE KIND STRANGERS, THE KILLING KIND) is ejected from Air-Force One in the middle of the dreaded Bermuda Triangle! In a hurricane! A rescue fleet of navy ships, headed by a nearly unrecognizable Linda Hamilton (THE TERMINATOR, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY) is dispatched. Within seconds of the fleet's arrival in the Triangle, giant tentacle / worm monsters attack for no apparent reason! Billions of bullets / rockets are expended. trillions of explosions go off.  Many deaths occur. Yep, BERMUDA TENTACLES lives up to the SYFY name, offering 90 minutes of humans vs. CGI absurdity and nonsense. Though it's certainly good to see that Ms. Hamilton is still acting, this movie is just plain rancid! Obviously, plot isn't overly important to any gargantuan worm movie, but this story had to have actually been conceived by invertebrates! The soldiers are stock monster-fodder, the scientist just wanders around spouting pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, and the offending creatures are the usual cartoonish, computer-regurgitated schlock. Unfortunately, it has none of the idiot charm of a SHARKNADO, so it loses steam fast. If you already love such films, then you'll probably enjoy this one. If not, then this will just make you mad. On the plus side, the mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle disappearances has now been revealed!...",1410566400,3,1410,5.351351351351352

That some adult would feel this script would be worth the time , money, and effort to turn it into a movie I have to question why. Why do people make films like this? While the production values are good, I have seen better, more interesting films when I was a kid on Saturday morning TV. Maybe the ending makes up for the beginning, but I was not able to endure watching more than half of it. Go take a walk around the block, you will be better off.",1410393600,,516,3.9711538461538463
6461562,2,B00L1WJIYU,"Another Asylum film.  Poorly done of course with name stars appearing.  You have navy ships being attacked by huge tentacles and everyone on the ships are dressed in camo and shooting at them with small arms.  What happened to the big guns, the 50 calibers, the depth charges?  Why is a admiral taking guff from a Chief Petty Officer?  Why is he still a Chief anyway?  If planes are doing such a good job, why keep attacking with helicopters?  You have an aircraft carrier there!  Why Linda Hamilton as an Admiral?  Why is the Chief called Sgt. Oliver the first time he lands on the ship?  Why does the space craft shoot it's ray destroying a ship and we are told it destroyed a town of 20,000?  Since when does a Chief order a Captain to launch any craft?  Way too many simple flaws in this one.  Fun premise but bad editing, bad wardrobe, shaky storyline - just typical Asylum film.  Some decent special effects and CGI kept this one from being a one star film.",1410393600,3,963,4.3977272727272725

6461566,1,B00L1WJIYU,"When I say that ""Bermuda Tentacles"" is one of the lesser Asylum originals, you should know to be very afraid. Unlike the ""Sharknado"" series which works because it's played to be fun with a cast that fully appreciate the ludicrousness of the joke, here Linda Hamilton and company play it deadly seriously with stern, wooden performances. The premise is like a mashup of plotlines from a lot of other better movies, and constantly moves tangentially to the central plot in a cauldron of subplots that do not work together featuring a cast that has no chemistry.

The President is flying in Air Force One in a terrible storm in the Bermuda Triangle and when the plane is going down he's put in an ejection pod and jettisoned. These geniuses didn't design the pod to float so he sinks like a stone to the bottom of the Atlantic, provoking an idiotic rescue mission. Chief Oliver (Trevor Donovan) who previously had some kind of relationship with Admiral Linda Hansen (Linda Hamilton)...yeah, that's plausible...is assigned the mission of retrieving POTUS from his comfy aqua-pod with the orders ""Bring the President back alive, son!"" Enroute to the rescue, the flotilla is attacked by giant barbed tentacles. They start by attacking the aircraft carrier battle group, and Dr. Zimmer (Jamie Kennedy) the token science guy, immediately identifies them as giant tubeworms. Yeah...tubeworms. Oh, the humanity!

The special effects are about what you'd expect from SyFy, which is to say laughable. Despite the tentacle peril, Chief Oliver decides to rescue the President and defy Hansen's direct orders by diving for the Presidential pod in the submersible ""Prometheus"", even though he knows this will result in his court martial. In other words, this is the least plausible military dynamic ever. There is a long backstory about an aborted previous rescue attempt that results in conflict between Hansen and Oliver, but meanwhile Dr. Zimmer spouts some absolutely hilarious technobabble pseudoscience about how...brace yourself...the tubeworms are from outer space!

The heroes take the submarine inside the extraterrestrial tubeworm and discover a giant airplane and ship graveyard that's the movie's one genuinely cool visual. The President's pod is located after a foot search in the underwater cave that houses every plane and ship ever lost in the Bermuda Triangle. Once they pick up the President they stop and chat a lot as they mosey back to the sub (maybe put a little spring in your step?) Amid dramatic scenes of pump maintenance and lines of dialogue like ""We're surrounded by tentacles!"" the Presidential rescue proceeds apace. Please note the airplane yokes that they steer the sub with; why are they connected to nothing, yet two crewmen are simultaneously required to steer? There's an electrical emergency of some sort, and the President suddenly opines about the best way to mend the circuitry, and presto, they get the sub back onboard the mother ship with no further difficulties. Hey, at least this President has a useful skill.

The President tries to be the hero and debates Hansen about whether or not he should get off the ship. He wants to lead in battle because he was a Marine after all and despite a big anti-nuke speech, authorizes the use of nuclear weapons on the extraterrestrial tubeworms. This provokes the giant flying starfish-spaceship (I don't know what else to call it) to engage in battle. The President doesn't relieve Hansen of command despite her being the least effective Admiral in naval history, although the long bloviating soliloquy kind of makes you side with the tubeworm monster. This leads to the stupidest plan ever foisted involving a conventional warhead and a helicopter and in the end Chief Oliver shoots the tubeworm down with a bazooka after it destroys Cape Hatteras.

In case you wanted to see more, the DVD includes a ""making of"" feature and a mostly lame gag reel. It is also dubbed in French which makes it much more amusing and no less lucid, even if you speak no French. For those interested in maritime trivia, ""Bermuda Tentacles"" was shot on the USS Iowa (which is a World War Two era battleship that's now a museum). Also note that this is a region B/2 disc which will not play in most North American players.

In the pantheon of SyFy classics from the Asylum, this is among the weakest and least entertaining. I normally like these movies as they are so cheesy they're enjoyable to watch and laugh along with (and at), but this one is painfully unpalatable.",1473552000,,4520,4.9801324503311255

Seconds before the plane blows up (hope we're not expected to pay for it).  His pod sinks into the Bermuda Triangle.  They sent out the fleet to find him.  (Maybe the vice president wasn't a good option.)  Enter Linda Hamilton with her bun wound a little too tightly.  She's in charge.  And don't you forget it!  Unfortunately, she has to put a yahoo she doesn't like in charge of the rescue mission (Trevor Donovan as Trip Oliver).  To lend an air of authority to the piece, they attach Jamie Kennedy as Dr. Zimmern, an expert in something or other (none too convincingly).  Consider everything comic relief.  Yes, there are tentacles or tube worms or long glowing angry thingy-things sprouting from the ocean.  It's all quite dramatic and not in the least realistic.  They are hostile.  Scores of people die.  Nary an alien is shown yet we're supposed to accept that this is entirely extraterrestrial in origin.  Thank goodness the dialog was scintillating.  ""Stay Frosty.""

The President while flying Air Force 1 over the Bermuda Triangle in a thunderstorm and without back up for reasons unknown is placed in a pod and jettisoned from the plane...apparently a pod that doesn't float. A group of naval vessels without submarine escort are quickly on the scene on a clear day as they are attacked by ""tube worms"" which we find out later are tentacles (hint we get from title). The movie divides into subplots with a mini-sub going on a rescue mission while Admiral ""I can't act"" handles things on top.

While I expect bad 50's style science fiction from SyFy, normally the feature isn't this bad.  I had trouble sitting through it and almost qualifies for a punch on the hacker card. Don't pay money to watch it.

6461644,3,B00L1WJIYU,"Here's a frantic SYFY-Channel mashup of now familiar cliches stolen almost at random from The Abyss, Independence Day and Escape From New York.

Air Force One has gone down with all aboard. Flying right into a Cat 5 hurricane! In the Bermuda Triangle!
The POTUS has ejected in a one man escape pod. No one designed the Presidential Escape Pod to float (!!!) so the pod is now lying on the ocean bottom at 20,000 feet.

When the entire US Navy Atlantic Fleet converges on the scene for search and rescue, they are immediately and unexplainedly attacked by dozens of giant, 500 foot tall metallic tentacles with scorpion-like stingers.
Although they are the US Navy, they don't use their Big Guns or assorted high-tech missiles to blast the attacking tentacles. Instead, the entire crew are ordered to rush onto the deck to pop away at the Giant Metallic Tentacles with small arms and handguns. Individual tentacles then skewer individual enlisted men. Repeat endlessly. This occupies a large part of the movie.

Linda Hamilton is the lone Big Name in all this, playing the Admiral In Charge and dutifully trying to do her best with a terrible, laughably bad script. The rest of the very young cast appear to have been recruited from the Santa Monica Dinner Theater cast of 'Death Of A Salesman'. There's an inexperienced, wooden earnestness to most of the cast of young unknowns that never improves as the film grinds on.

The CGI tentacles are just terrible, like bad cartoon anime. There's a mostly unseen alien city on the sea floor borrowed from The Abyss, and a giant (pressurized and surface-atmosphere) underwater cavern where each and every ship and plane ever to have disappeared in the Triangle have been brought, dissected and left as scrap. That's a cool visual for the minute or so of screen time that it gets, but we see very little of it before it's back to Handguns Versus Giant Tentacles.

The entire cast of characters consists of US Navy personnel. The entire film takes place on US Navy ships. But the young Gen Y civilian screenwriters for SYFY clearly have no idea whatever how the military speaks, which ranks are which, how terminology works or how simple everyday instructions are given and acknowledged.
One Navy character is a 'Sargent' one minute (there are no Sargents in the Navy) and a 'Chief' the next. Angry low ranking personnel under the slightest stress bark orders (!) at their Commanding Admiral. It's silly at first, then annoying.

All in all this is one step up from MST3K material. All but the most diehard Linda Hamilton fans will want to avoid this one, and even the LH fans will need a stiff drink to get through this.
Barely OK for Prime Streaming, but I wouldn't care to own it on DVD.

Try to give the script writers a break on some of the horrendous line they wrote for The Admiral, Linda Hamilton She is a good actor, don't know why she wound up in this flick. Not a George Lucas production but it did not cost $200 million to make either.

The monsters were a bit like aluminum foil though I couldn't help but like them. The lead guy Chief Oliver was nice to look at and did a good job.  He sort of reminded me of Brad Pitt with a lot more muscles. Linda Hamilton has aged, but haven't we all? She was believable in the part as Admiral.

Now, Bermuda Tentacles???? The ""star"" Trevor Donovan must have needed the job/money...I think there is talent there but well, it is a SYFY movie. I think he had nothing to work with. The rest of the cast OH MY GOD, don't list this on your resume'.  Now for the reason I only got 48 minutes into it. Linda Hamilton, plays ""the Admiral"" in command of the fleet!

There's an aging actress, one or two B-list TV stars, some unconvincing CGI, and a script that makes no sense whatsoever.  This one was painfully stupid (caution: Spoilers!):  A giant alien ship in the center of the Bermuda Triangle has been hijacking ships using CGI tentacles.  Somehow the alien ship causes Air Force One to crash, leaving the President sealed in a ""pod""  (remember ""Escape from New York?"") which naturally has to be found by a tough-as-nails disgraced hero who will redeem himself by Breaking The Rules To Save The Day.

At least in the bad old 1950s, the effects were unconvincing but the scripts made sense.  I think we were better off with fake monsters and real writers - today we have CGI monsters  and fake writers, apparently",1414195200,,938,4.746913580246914

6461697,3,B00L1WJIYU,"OK, three stars is probably a bit too much.  It has to do with expectations - don't be surprised by non sequiturs because there was very little money left for editing.  Don't be surprised by flat performances, because there was no money for another take.  Don't be surprised that the fx rival that of Star Trek-TOS - there was no.. You get the idea.  Still, it's not a bad concept, and while there are moments that a viewer can laugh out loud at, I see potential.  James Cameron, for instance, could remake this movie shot for shot with more takes and better effects and it would be terrific.  A few tweaks and it would be outstanding science fiction.

Still, it's disappointing that Linda Hamilton and John Savage can't get a job in which they go from table read to one-take shooting.  These are actors capable of more.  It's also amusing to see Jamie Kennedy walk through this like he's hung over.  He's barely there.  And Kennedy takes direction well - I can hear in my mind the director yelling ""Look UP' as the entire cast, mouths agape, look up while Kennedy looks stage right.

8663249,4,B00L1WJIYU,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2014 and directed by Nick Lyon, Bermuda Tentacles covers events in the Bermuda Triangle after the president of the USA (John Savage) is ejected from the doomed Air Force One on an escape pod. Linda Hamilton plays the admiral in charge of the military operation searching for the pod at the depths of the ocean. Unfortunately some kind of multi-tentacled life-form threatens the task. Trevor Donovan plays the risk-taking leader of the rescue team and Ma Marie Harrison a lieutenant who joins the squad. Jamie Kennedy appears as the onboard scientist.

I saw the horrible reviews for this Asylum flick, which debuted on Syfy, so I was fully prepared for a real dog, like 2007s dull 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but Bermuda Tentacles is actually pretty decent for a TV sci-fi/horror flick. This is an austere military-oriented movie and the thrills are consistent from beginning to end. All the vessel scenes were shot on a real battleship. True, the CGI tentacles are cartoony, but anyone viewing a movie that debuts on Syfy expects that anyway.

What surprised me was that I thought this would be a movie about vessels combatting tentacled monsters. While theres a lot of this, particularly in the first act, the movie is more ambitious and opts for elements of movies like Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), Alien/Aliens (1979/1986), The Abyss (1989), Independence Day (1996) and The Core (2003), albeit on a TV budget. There are some genuine wonder-inducing moments.

Being an action-based military-focused flick, don't expect any of the women to appear in alluring apparel. Curvy Ma, for instance, appears in unflattering cammies from beginning to end, but she does a fine job and is likable.
