I generally hate so-called documentaries because they invariably have some agenda to move forward, or some establishment crock to reinforce like the war distortions etc.
However, in ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon""  it appears to me that the the only agenda the director has is a desire for truth and exposing government lies.

1406768,1,B000059MCU,"If by some chance you haven't heard of or seen this ""documentary"", save yourself the trouble. It is merely a bunch of information presented in a biased and misleading way with the goal of convincing people that somehow, the Apollo moon missions of the late 1960's and early 1970's were faked for some mysterious reason. The ""facts"" presented in the documentary are all tired old clich&eacute;s that have all been debunked many years ago, there's really not much to see. Bart Sibrel has no scientific credentials whatsoever, being an ex cab driver, ex TV cameraman, and part-time minister and radio host, and not a pilot, scientist, physicist, mathematician, or any other profession that would give his theories any weight at all. The fact is, he's wrong in his ideas, comically wrong, and this documentary is just an attempt to cash in on the craze for conspiracy theories in general, the theory being that persons amenable to one theory will be likely to listen and believe another, even if it's completely unrelated. It is not a mystery that so many of the people who buy into the moon landing hoax theories are also heavily invested in conspiracy theories involving JFK, 9/11, Oklahoma City, Area 51, or a host of others. The Apollo missions stand as some of the best documented events of the 20th century, as well as the greatest scientific achievements of that century, and this tawdry attempt to diminish their importance and the bravery of the men who flew on them is embarrassing at best, and insulting in any event.

This is one of those cases where a zero rating would be more appropriate, if only it was possible.",1407628800,5,1624,4.8

1406771,1,B000059MCU,"First of all, this is a review of the movie itself and not the possibility of a conspiracy.  One thing these films seem to have in common is that barely intelligent feel.  What I mean is that these people think they are pointing out things which prove how hight their IQs are, but in reality show their ignorance.
This is a film and as such it should draw in the viewer.  This one does not.  When it starts, I can not tell if it is a moon hoax movie, an anti-government movie or an anti-big business movie.  It intercuts scenes of the Apollo missions with scenes of starving people and violence in other countries.  If the writer wanted a movie about how much we were spending on the moon missions, he should have made a movie about that.  I can't really tell which part he is complaining about.
The movie is not entertaining and has no focus, but what about the science?  Horrible.  He talks about shadows and stars, which we have all heard before.  Cameras do not work the same way the eye does.  If I adjust aperature for the brightness of the moon, it will drop shadows into complete darkness.  The opposite is also true- if I adjust for the shadows, the highlights will be blown out.  It is called clipping and is prevalent even on todays best digital cameras.
The color video camera used inside the module was a film camera and not capable of live broadcast.  The BW one which did broadcast, was a huge contraption that could not be moved inside the module.
I could go on and on about the stupidity of this, but the movie does it for me.  Somehow it meanders about and we get end with a shot of Kennedy's assassination.  I am not sure how that relates to the moon landing, but maybe it is meant to show that Kennedy was going to out the moon program and so astronaut snipers killed him.",1342915200,11,1792,4.336336336336337

1406774,1,B000059MCU,"WOW, did NASA really fake the Moon Landings, when over 400,000 people were directly involved with the project? Did our own Astronauts, heroes to the USA and the World, lie to us all this time? . . . Keep reading !

At first, I was shocked and intrigued by the idea that NASA might have conspired to fake the Apollo Moon Landings. I grew up during the Space Race and the Astronauts were my childhood heroes. Naturally, the information documented and presented by Bart Sibrel was disturbing to me. At first, it was interesting, but then I decided to research the ""source"", Bart Sibrel himself.

What I found was more shocking and disturbing than the possibility of massive fraud by NASA ...

What did I learn about Mr. Sibrel and his ""credentials"" and ""expertise"" ?

(1) Bart Sibrel is a TAXI-CAB DRIVER in Nashville, TN . . . Certainly, not a ""Rocket Scientist"" !

(2) He attacked a person over a PARKING SPACE . . . Google it for proof.

(3) He STALKED Apollo 11 Astronaut BUZZ ALDRIN, who finally punched Sibrel in Self-Defense . . .  It's on YouTube!

There are numerous accounts regarding Bart Sibrel's past behavior on the internet, just Google up his name and see for yourselves!

FRANKLY, in closing, I would not believe BART SIBREL if he told me that the Sun was shining, without looking to be sure . . .

BART SIBREL has no ""professional experience"" in the U.S. Manned Space Program apparently has some type of problem . . .  I am shocked that so many people have believed this wild tale of conspiracy at ""face value"", without ever considering the source !

It never fails to amuse me that these people who are supposedly 'rational' will not even entertain the idea that the moon landing was faked.

If you are interested in this movie you really only have one question to ask yourself.  Is it possible that the moon landing was faked?  Unless you were actually in the capsule with the astronauts there is only one way to answer.  Of course its possible.",1303430400,5,736,4.572519083969466

1406796,5,B000059MCU,"As already noted this is not the best documentary in the genre, but it does contain some rather explosive evidence against the official version of events, and the movie maker has to be commended for the way he confronted the liars who pose as lunar astronauts. Aside from most of the standard points noted the golden nugget consists of video footage of the astronauts clearly in low earth orbit taking pictures of a transparency of the earth over a backlit window in order to give the impression that the earth was photographed whilst very far away. That this really IS a true record of events is confirmed by the actual mission photography; for anyone who doubts this, try this very very simple test:

Got to Google & search for ""Apollo Image Atlas"". Select the first Google result, then select 70mm Hasselblad, Apollo 11, Magazine N. Scroll slowly down the images showing the earth getting successively further away until you get to those numbered from AS11-36-5382 to AS11-36-5399 showing the astronauts inside Apollo, allegedly something like 150,000 miles from earth. How is it possible that blue light is visible through ALL the windows which are visible in those pictures? Where does the blue light come from if they really are in deep space halfway to the moon?

Another simple test:

Go to Apollo 11, Magazine S, image number AS11-40-5930 (indeed, any similar image showing an astronaut's shadow from behind like this will do, they all have the same problem). At the bottom of the page click on the link to see the Hi Resolution Image(s), then save the image to your PC. Open the image in Windows in Paint Shop Pro or PhotoShop or similar, or open it in Linux with Gimp. Create a negative of the image, then zoom in to the rocks in the right and the left of the image. You will see indisputably, especially clearly in negative as the shadow shows up as stark white, that in the left of the image the shadows are on the right side of the rocks, and on the right side of the image the shadows are indisputably on the left of the rocks. In the foreground they go from south to north. Additionally, there is a very obvious ""hot spot"" around the astronaut shadow's head, which again can be more clearly seen in negative. This is indicative of a bright spotlight behind the astronaut's head, whilst the shadows running in different directions are proof positive multiple light sources either side of the camera were also used. If the sun really was the only source of light on the moon (and the Apollo missions took NO extra lighting with them) then all shadows should run parallel and there should be no hotspots, as the sun is the same distance away from all objects on the moon.

If you cannot explain why these problems exist when they should not (without resorting to MythBusters....!!!), you need to think seriously about the content of this video, and others which are far better, because these government-sponsored hoaxes come directly out of YOUR POCKET! And especially for those in the US, don't forget you are about to cough up countless billions more to ""go back to the moon"" in 2018, when we KNOW it is impossible using current technology. Note that the objection ""the images have been digitally enhanced"" does not explain the observed effects. Digital enhancement should not change the direction of shadows, and nor can it contribute to an illusion of blue light where there should be black space.

The best video on the subject is without a doubt What Happened On The Moon, which is accompanies the book Dark Moon: Apollo & The Whistle-Blowers by Bennett & Percy. Another very good book on the subject is One Small Step? : The Great Moon Hoax and the Race to Dominate Earth from Space by Gerhard Wisnewski. This video, whilst not the best, is a valuable addition to the mountain of evidence accumulating against the official version.

Arthur Schopenhauer said ""All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident."" Unfortunately for NASA, the cat is out of the bag and it is now only a matter of time before the truth is accepted as self evident by all, even those with a desperate NEED to believe: we did not, we CAN NOT go to the moon using currently available technology because, very simply, we cannot hope to survive the radiation ever-present in space and made even worse close to earth by the madness of NASA & the US DoD in 1962 during Operations Argus & Starfish Prime.",1292371200,9,4484,4.705732484076433
1406797,5,B000059MCU,"This is an excellent piece of investigative journalism, a real pity finding out the moon landings were faked but the truth is more important than what people want to believe.
It's a sad indictment of the scientific community when it's so obvious the landings are a fraud, that many, not all, deny the evidence and support these lies. There is much more proof than offered in this video, science should be based on evidence, fact and reason.
Not to worry, the video points out that we are all mortal and asks for the astronaughts to come clean before they die off.  As time marches on, more and more people can see through organisations and evidence becomes more undeniable, like the belief that the earth is flat, the truth will be firmly established.

What is immediately striking about the brief 50 minutes we are shown, is how much irrelevant padding is included. In the opening 15 minutes we are treated to numerous pointless asides from the creator, where he talks about the Titanic, the tower of Babel, and how it was ""God's irony"" that they would fail.

Most people will be familiar with the various tenets of moon hoax theory so there is no need to enumerate them here. What is unique about this production is their use of a video which was supposedly sent from NASA buy mistake. This video purports to show members of the moon mission faking some of the operation. This video however, contains a huge and obvious edit, and offers effectively no evidence that these are genuine moon mission tapes.

On top of this, the producer of this video is a man who makes a habit of following around and harassing members of the Apollo 11 mission, trying to make them swear to their participation in the mission on a bible. This is one production that is to be avoided.",1271030400,15,1216,4.6465116279069765

1406801,5,B000059MCU,"Sibrel's film is an artistic portrayal unlike any I've seen in a documentary film.  The film begins with statements of absolutes, and then offers near the end, an inside look into how the missions were faked from the command module - the absolute proof that Apollo 11 did not go to the moon.  But I have a different take on it.  This footage was shot for another reason.

There the three men are, creating a lasting moment for television viewers - of which only 20 seconds was aired.  They are caught lying about where the camera is.  They are caught trying to pretend that the inside of their spacecraft is deep space itself, by zooming in from the other side of the CSM while claiming that they can't get near the window to see the Earth because the camera is in the way.  There is much more here.  I watched the DVD over and over, there was so much in this one scene alone to take in.

It is important to note that, [...], Sibrel has changed his mind about how they faked the Earth image.  Apparently, he did not think it through as he should have.  I think the website offers this DVD for free. Don't quote me on that.

I personally think we went, but buying this DVD was worth it because I
was forced to defend my beliefs against some very strong evidence when it came to the Apollo 11 footage.

I decided that they must have filmed this before the mission in case they died, because it's just too big of a screwup to be an actual part of the mission.  I mean it's very bad, because they only had two more days to get to the moon - the film is from July 18th, and it proves they were not on their way to the moon when this footage was shot.

I'm guessing that, like Nixon, they made this in case they would die on the way.  Five stars, despite my disagreement with Sibrel.  This film is well worth the price for the historical footage it delivers.",1212537600,9,1852,4.215909090909091

So everyone coming to this film has had years of being told the official line. That's a lot to compete with and a lot to flush out of the brain.

Just imagine if the USSR (Russia) had carried out the moon landing.

Imagine the dent in US national pride. Well if Bart SIbrel had then come along and accused the USSR of faking the landing.

The US support would have been in the majority - 'of course Russia did not land on the moon' everyone would have chorused.

The problem is that most people see such an historic event, an event that has come to be seen as 'man's' greatest achievement, through political filters.

No if Russia had done it, becuase we don't WANT them to have done,

or YES if the US did it, beacuse we'd WANT that.

Looking at the evidence presented in the films, and looking at the official responses, and debunking, the case for a faked moon landing is over the 1/2 way mark - so its more likely that it was faked than real.

I suggest you watch his films for yourself, and decide for yourself, and try not to let any preconcieved ideas filter what you see.

1406834,1,B000059MCU,"This ""documentary"" is so chock-full of inaccuracies, lies, deceptions and misconceptions, that Michael Moore would be proud to call it his own.

Bart Sibrel, a one-time video editor who was fired for incompetence, now purports to be some kind of ""authority"" in the field of video and photo analysis, and even fraudulently misrepresents himself as working for the Discovery Channel from time to time.  He continually stalks former astronauts, aggressively confronting them and demanding they ""swear on his Bible"" that they walked on the moon. When some of them understandably refuse, he becomes even more belligerent - once getting a much-deserved punch in the mouth from Buzz Aldrin because of his predatory behavior. Yay Buzz!!!

Of course when they DO take him up on his asinine offer, (as Gene Cernan and Alan Bean did) he makes absolutely no mention of it. Buy this compost heap of a DVD only if you enjoy burning money and being taken for a fool, because that is precisely what this charlatan is doing in selling it to you.

In all his blustering about how the moon landings were faked, Sibrel fails to confront the one bit of ""solid proof"" evidence that the conspiracy crowd hates to debate: The fact that the ultra-fine, powdery ""dirt"" kicked up by the astronauts and lunar rover, instantly falls to the surface. It does not leave floating clouds of dust. The reason is obvious: THERE WAS NO AIR WHERE THE VIDEO WAS SHOT.

1406835,1,B000059MCU,"This movie is the worst kind of ""documentary"". It makes outlandish claims that contradict well-established science, and totally ignores evidence that contradicts its conclusion. The ""secret"" footage used by Mr Sibrel (supposedly showing the crew of Apollo 11 staging the flight to the moon and supposedly never available anywhere else) is on my bookshelf at home ... as part of Spacecraft Films Apollo 11 DVD set. That set also includes additional footage that demonstrates quite clearly exactly the opposite of what Sibrel claims and (rather than an inane and emotive commentary put in place by the moviemaker) includes the original soundtrack from the Lunar Module where the astronauts explain exactly what they are doing.

As far as Spider ""Boy""s questions are concerned, why not check out some websites offering proper scientific critiques of the moon landing hoax theories, such as [...] and [...] instead of just taking this films word for it. For the record though ...

1. Who filmed the lift off? If it was a direct feed, then is the feed still there, or did the battery die, and if not, when did it die out?

This was Apollo 17. The lift-off was filmed using the camera mounted on the Lunar Rover (which was left there) and controlled remotely from Mission Control. Quite a simple thing to setup.

2. Temperatures on the moon range from -150 to +250 degrees, but yet they never seem to discuss that when you hear about the moon. They were supposed to have withstood those extreme temperatures for days?

You are correct ... except the moon heats up and cools down slowly. It does not instantly change from -150 to +250 degrees as soon as the sun comes out. All the landings happened early in the Lunar day (which is 14 Earth days long BTW) when the temp was nowhere near the maximum, and plenty of planning for thermal control.

3. Why did the shadow get shorter and longer when the men walk? How is that possible in the sunlight? Only happens in artificial light.

All I can say is you have obviously never walked on a hill, or in a quarry, on a sunny day. The terrain affects shadows enormously ... just pay attention the next time you are out in the Sun.

1406837,4,B000059MCU,"This video, was my first exposure to the Apollo hoax genre. I found it not as thorough as I'd hoped, but a good introduction, that spurred me to take a critical look at Apollo. The problem with this idea of Apollo being a hoax, is that people are mostly in the habit of believing things blindly, especially when they get it from ""mainstream"" sources. We believe things mostly because we hear and see them on TV, or because a ""respected"" expert or leader assures us they're true. Serious scrutiny is never undertaken, difficult questions are rarely asked, and it's even become fashionable to ridicule and laugh at anyone who dares to question the ""official story"". Blind faith is never smart, yet people seem to have confounded blind faith and gullibility with intelligence! Unfortunately for those who dismiss or guffaw at the Apollo hoax and other so-called ""conspiracy theories"" the joke is on them. Rather than honesty and integrity, the U.S. government has a very real history of scams and hoaxes against the U.S. public.

The good thing is, common sense is all that's needed to identify most government hoaxes and scams, yet people rarely make use of it. First one must dispense with the NASA and media hype, as well as the ridicule of the gullible masses. Then one must take a common sense look at some basic facts of Apollo. It soon becomes quite obvious that something is very wrong. NASA went from projects mercury, to gemini, then to apollo, yet find's itself back at a glorified project gemini, with the Shuttle program! Why does NASA limit itself so rigidly to earth orbital missions today, when they've allegedly mastered the far more daunting skill of manned lunar flight over thirty years ago? The science and technology of manned space flight has progressed, yet live manned missions seem to have regressed! There's something very wrong with this picture. At the end of the day, this descrepancy is enough to give the lie to Apollo. Successful advances in manned spaceflight or any other scientific endeavor for that matter, tend to be built upon, not abandoned. This has invariably been the case throughout the history of mechanized flight, until Apollo. What prevents NASA from reprising or building upon, their Apollo lunar prowess today? Why has NASA dumbed down the manned space program to it's current limited dimensions, if they've actually been to the moon? Had manned lunar flight actually been mastered, it's safe to say such missions would've become easier to do, not more difficult. NASA's complete inability to do a manned lunar mission today, or in the foreseeable future, is proof positive that Apollo was a hoax.",1153699200,26,2644,4.928251121076233
1406838,5,B000059MCU,"It is evident that there is a large and concerted effort to discredit this movie.  I just saw it in the company of 80 people from around the globe, and we were all blown away.  Every person came away KNOWING it was impossible to have had a moon landing.

Why didn't we go back to the moon?  The lies we have been fed to believe are beyond nauseating, and I can understand the reluctance some have to confront this, as this undermines the sense of Uncle Sam as our friend and protector instead of bleeding us of TRILLIONS of tax dollars, lying to us and raping our sensibilites for these many decades.  This cracks open the lie, pulls back the curtain from the Great OZ, and most find it too scary to see what's back there.

But if you want to continue believing in fairy tales, then along with believing we went to the moon, you are probably doing the following:
(1) taking your share of the drugs Big Pharma is pushing on you on every TV commercial
(2) eating the ""food"" sold in supermarkets, and when you feel like crap, see step one.  You will be a candidate for the top 3 diseases.  Take your pick.  This is a set-up, if you haven't yet figured it out.
(3) believe that the cost of the war in Iraq [...] is the best use of your tax-payer money, rather than education, housing or alternative energy.
(4) believe what the news media spits out on TV every night.

Most people find it easier to stay asleep.  This DVD is designed to wake you up.

Are you ready?

Do you have a fire in your belly to know the truth?  WARNING! It will forever change you, and your innocence will be stripped away.

1406839,5,B000059MCU,"Someone told me that China has plans to go to the moon, just to prove that we never have.  They can save their effort.

In 47 minutes, this film makes all others on the subject obsolete.

The film hinges upon footage that the government accidentally released to the filmmakers, which shows the astronauts faking a significant part of the mission.  As the creator has said elsewhere, this footage made the likelihood that the moon landings were faked jump from 25% (in his estimation) to 100%.

The film also proves that the ""moon"" had an atmosphere.  The flag is blowing in the wind.  ""Debunkers"" claim that ""From the first Apollo landing, astronauts commented on how difficult it was to insert the flag into the ground. They encountered very hard ground at about 9-11 inches, and had to twist the metal pole repeatedly to get it to seat in the surface properly. It is this motion which [a previous film] is seeing and attributing to wind.""

From the footage in this film it is unmistakable that the flag is blowing in gusts of wind.

The film also puts to rest explanations for the shadows that suggest artificial lighting was used.  The ""debunkers"" claim that an uneven surface caused the illusion of shadows curving, but this film shows shadows in perpendicular directions on flat surfaces.

Some of the film's other evidence is questionable, but in light of the proof (the astronauts are caught on tape faking footage), the film wisely notes how absurd the story was in the first place: that American astronauts, having not yet completed a full orbit of the Earth, made it 250,000 miles to the moon on their first (and second) attempts, somehow forgetting to bring a telescope and to take pictures of the stars.

Frankly, when I saw the ""moonwalk"" footage played back at double speed, which made it obvious that the ""moonwalk"" was faked with slow motion, it had me there.  After three days in a cramped shuttle, nobody to tried a high jump?  No way.

""One small step for man"" indeed!

To think this movie is anything less than proof is desperation on the cusp of madness.  From the poopy reviews given by others, it's clear that the real problem people have with this movie is how a belief they've had their entire lives could be so easily proven false.",1148601600,22,2257,4.687817258883249

Young threatens to slug Sibrel after being ask to swear on his mommy's Bible that he walked on the Moon. That's proof?  When I watch Sibrel, I want to slug him too!

Why does Sibrel believe we can launch a 400 foot rocket into Earth orbit, but then suggest we don't have the know-how to relight its 3rd stage to go into lunar orbit?  That's like saying, ""Sure, someone can built a 747 and propose flying people across the ocean, and sure, even though I saw it takeoff myself, I still find no reason to believe that it actually does cross the ocean...it's just a hoax...and I can prove it by showing training videos and photos where it looks like the 747 is missing a wing.""

1406860,1,B000059MCU,"About five years ago, fox (deliberately not capitalized) aired a TV show about how NASA had faked the moon landings and I couldn't believe that with the great wealth of scientific and engineering data available that the moon landings were faked.  Since that time, I have become very interested in the Moon Hoax Conspiracy and have researched both sides of the arguments.  As an engineer with over twenty years of research, design and development experience in the areas of heat transfer, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics research, I felt that I could provide an unbiased scientific/engineering evaluation of at least some of the claims.  One thing I should add, unlike others who have probably provided a review without even having seen this video, I can honestly say that I own this production and have watched it six or seven times and selected sections more than that.

The DVD opens with several minutes of material related to the Bible and specifically the Tower of Babel.  What this has to do with the hoaxed moon landings and NASA is not clear?  Possibly he wants to show an early and failed attempt by man to reach the heavens.  Personally, I feel that producer/director Bart Sibrel believes that mankind has not been to the moon because in the Bible it says ""The heavens belong to the Lord, but the earth is given to us,"" (Psalms 115:16).  After this section, the viewer is shown more than a dozen clips of rockets exploding and crashing during liftoff.  It is at this point that I noticed the deception beginning.  Here are four examples.

1) All of the exploding vehicles are Army and Air Force missiles and none of them were intended for manned spaceflight which has much more rigorous safety and reliability requirements.  Furthermore, none of the rockets were NASA launch vehicles.

2) Some the rockets shown are not rockets at all, but early concepts for cruise missiles (Bomarc and Navajo).

3) A good portion of the clips predate the formation of NASA and are Department of Defense missiles.

4) Several of the clips are simply repeats, except that the producer has reversed the image.  In other words, the producer is trying to deceive the viewer into believing the failure rate is much greater by repeating and slightly changing the clips.  It should be noted that this repetitive technique occurs throughout the show.

After this section, the deceptive practices continued, and here are few I noticed.

He claims that the Lunar Module (LM) should have created a blast crater when it landed.  His proof is a sketch of some sort lunar lander vehicle (which is NOT the LM) which shows a blast crater.  Hardly, what one would call proof.  He does not provide any sort of technical analysis, expert opinion, etc and to why there should be a blast crater.  A search of the NASA archives (available publicly via the internet) reveals that NASA did in fact examine this problem and concluded the blast crater would be less than an inch deep.

He claims that Neil Armstrong rarely gives interviews and when he does it is only a NASA sponsored reunions efforts.  A simple internet search revealed many non-NASA Neil Armstrong interviews, including several complete audio interviews, all conducted before the production of this DVD.  It should be pointed out that several of the interviews were conducted by the noted historians, Stephen Ambrose and Douglas Brinkley.  I feel the real answer is that Neil Armstrong won't give Bart Sibrel an interview.  Furthermore, Neil Armstrong has spoken and continues to speak at various non-NASA events, many of which are open to the public.

His most outrageous claim involves his secret NASA footage which he mistakenly interprets as the astronauts practicing faking an upcoming broadcast.  The narrator states the clip is, ""never before seen or heard footage"" which is a complete lie.  These statements by the producers are nothing but spin and sales hype.  In fact, all this footage, plus nearly ten additional hours is available from Spacecraft Films (for sale here on amazon.com) for only ONE dollar more (that's not a typo).

In conclusion, this show should be watched for amusement, because the research involved in this documentary (and I use that term very, very loosely) bears the same relationship to serious scholarship that pop rocks candy do to geology.",1144281600,25,4318,4.944521497919556
1406861,1,B000059MCU,"If I had any doubts about the authenticity of the moon landings before watching this video, Bart Sibrel has certainly removed them.  This video is nothing but a sleazy con job meant to separate fools from their money by libeling the reputations of honorable men.  I'm happy to report I got to see this video without having to paying for it.

Sibrel does make a few attempts to present evidence, but his ignorance of science and distortion of historical facts makes his conclusions laughable.  He is so stingy with the facts that it can be nothing else but a deliberate effort to deceive the viewer.  The last thing Sibrel wants is for the viewer to think for him/herself.  He tells you exactly what you ""should"" think and then hopes you lack the gumption to question it.

To make the viewer more susceptible to suggestion, Sibrel tries to get you all worked up emotionally by referencing examples of past government malfeasance, both real and imagined.  It is a cheap trick intended to turn the issue into a question of trust and credibility rather then a clear-headed, reasoned, and full examination of the evidence.

Near the end Sibrel finally shows his alleged ""smoking gun"" evidence, which he falsely claims is never before seen video.  Unfortunately Sibrel doesn't allow us to examine it; instead we're shown a couple minutes of edited footage that is voiced over with the narrator's commentary.  Sibrel again tries to force upon us his interpretation, yet we see nothing in the video that gives us reason to favor his explanation over any other.

First of all, the rockets really went up into the air.

Next, the capsules really did come out of the sky.

Next, the capsules really weren't in earth's orbit, or they would have been seen, so they had to go somewhere. Why not the moon?

Next, if you listen to any of the astronauts speak candidly, there is no perception of falsity in what they say, along with all of the people who worked on the project.

Next, the movie is done as a conspiracy theory.  That should tell you something.

Next, the scientific community feels we went, and I trust them more than a conspiracy theorist, and even the government.  They are not the same.  Let's put that into perspective.

1406864,1,B000059MCU,"If after watching this program you are having doubts about whether we ever set foot on the moon, I suggest you put Sibrel's so-called ""evidence"" to the test and see if it holds up.  And it is very simple.  First regarding his claim that shadows produced by the sun are always parallel, take two pencils outdoors on a sunny day and stand them upright so that they are perpendicular to a flat surface and parallel to each other.  You will notice that their shadows are indeed parallel.  Next either tilt one of them so that it is no longer perpendicular, or stand them on an uneven surface so that they are no longer parallel to each other.  Are the shadows still parallel?  Definitely not.  And if you don't believe me, go out and try it.

You can also test Sibrel's claim that stars should appear in the Apollo photographs if they were actually taken on the moon.  Try taking a picture of the stars at night with a camera.  You will find that the only way they can be seen on film is by using a long exposure setting.  Now try taking a picture of, say, a building at night lit by a streetlamp and using a long enough exposure setting so that stars can be seen in the photograph as well.  What does the building look like in the photo?  It is badly overexposed.  Likewise, for stars to appear in the Apollo photographs, the astronauts would have had to use long exposure settings, which would badly overexpose the foreground lunar surface.  Notice in photographs of Earth taken from the space shuttle, you don't see stars in the background blackness of space either.  Again, try this experiment for yourself if you don't believe me.

Now how plausible is it that an individual with an obviously poor understanding of shadows and light, and long vs. short time exposure photography, for two easily provable examples, who nevertheless would have you believe that he is an expert on these subjects, would know what he is talking about on any other subject for which he is not an expert, such as the Van Allen radiation belts, or anything else associated with the Apollo program?

Sibrel claims on his moonmovie.com website, and in his own self-serving review found elsewhere at this site, that since so many people try and refute his claims, and warn others not to buy this program, that they don't want you to see it so it must therefore be true.  (It can't be that they are merely trying to warn would-be buyers not to waste their money on such trash).  On the contrary, I encourage everyone to see it (ideally without spending money on it if you can) and put every one of his claims to the test whenever possible (after getting over your bellyache from laughing so hard at how ridiculous this nonsense is), then decide for yourself if NASA was indeed perpetrating a hoax, or if the real hoax perpetrator is the director of ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon.""",1134518400,30,2870,4.535922330097088

But, and this is the thing, and in a way it makes me feel guilty for only giving it 3 stars, it shows quite clearly that on the 18th of July Apollo was in earth orbit and not 130,000 miles out as Armstrong states. How does it do this? It shows a very bright earth outside the window at the end of the clip. That's all, but it's enough.

1406883,1,B000059MCU,"This film is highly deceptive.  After several minutes of emotional religious setup reeking of brimstone, it presents a few slipshod and comical attempts at discussing astrophysics and rocket science, neither of which its writer/director Bart Sibrel seems to know anything about.  The film tries to argue that Apollo was suspiciously successful after the initial Mercury project failures.  But that's easy to do when you completely ignore -- as Mr. Sibrel has -- the Gemini project in which all those problems were faced and solved, including the supposedly impassable Van Allen belts.  (Here's a hint:  Dr. Van Allen, for whom the belts are named, specifically repudiates this filmmaker's radiation arguments.)  The film argues that the Soviets had a 5-to-1 advantage in space, but that was true only in about 1960.  After Gemini (circa 1968) it was 3-to-1 in America's favor.  That is just one of the film's many misleading statements.

Only toward the very end do you get to see any of the ""smoking gun"" footage from Apollo 11.  Mr. Sibrel says the astronauts faked their distant en-route telecasts by shooting lots of video from Earth orbit using camera tricks.  This raw footage was allegedly edited on the ground into only a few seconds or minutes of ""polished"" footage that the world saw.  From an hour of ""backstage"" film the director says NASA mistakenly sent him, Mr. Sibrel shows only a snippet here and there, most of it without the audio that clearly explains what the astronauts were really doing -- testing television equipment they hadn't had time to learn to use.  Instead the narrator repeats Mr. Sibrel's accusations of fraud.  In fact, there's probably more time devoted to the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination (which is shown in eerie slow-motion with a dramatic gunshot sound effect at the grisly climax) than to the film's supposedly exclusive evidence.

The secret this film keeps most closely is that anyone can get Bart Sibrel's raw footage.  It's not hidden away in some vault.  You can buy it from Spacecraft Films uncut in a high-quality DVD format preserving all the conversations he elected to omit, as well as the shots that clearly contradict Mr. Sibrel's theory.  You can, for example, see that the video was shot through the square side window of the spacecraft, not through the supposedly round hatch window.  (The hatch had a round inside bezel, but a trapezoidal outside bezel -- a fact Mr. Sibrel could easily have researched but apparently chose not to.)  You can see shots that include both the window frame and the distant Earth, clearly proving that the image of Earth was NOT an illusion created by the stagecraft trickery he suggests.  Most enlightening, you can hear the astronauts discuss with Mission Control how they're only testing the camera, not collecting footage for fakery.

The only bit of evidence Mr. Sibrel can offer to support his interpretation is the title plate of the reel he was sent, saying that the footage is ""not for general public distribution"".  That doesn't mean ""Keep it a secret.""  There are many examples of genuine declassified NASA material from that period, and the stern warnings about what will happen if you release it inappropriately are in clear contrast to the gentle suggestion from the NASA Public Affairs office regarding this footage.

But so certain is the director that his raw footage is top secret backstage photography, he didn't realize that many of his ""backstage"" shots actually come from the 30-minute live telecast that was seen by millions, which is also included on his reel and instantly recognized by people well enough versed in Apollo history.  That is, his reel contains both test footage that wasn't broadcast to the world at the time, and also a record of the live telecast for which those legitimate backstage sessions were practice.  Sibrel doesn't know the difference, and so he indiscriminately uses shots from both sources, claiming it's all backstage stuff that was never seen.  Many of the gaffes he says reveal the hoax in the ""raw"" footage were actually seen live by the entire civilized world, not trimmed away as outtakes by NASA editors.

Like other films of this type, the director's premise is established only by manipulation, misdirection, and selective quotation -- carefully controlling what the viewer sees and hears so as to preclude coming to any other conclusion.  Save yourself some money.  For the same price as Mr. Sibrel's film you can get all the Apollo 11 raw footage and judge for yourself without his ""help"".",1104969600,92,4554,5.0

We can count the dimples on a golfball from 30 miles up in space with our spy satallite cameras today but we can't take a single photo of the moon landing site to see if what we supposedly left up there is still there and in the location that it is supposed to be? The Hubble telescope can look back into space millions of years and see light from the time of the big bang but none of our satalliets can take a close up shot of the surface of the moon where we supposedly landed and left all kinds of equipment behind? I don't think so.

It  even addresses the logistics of keeping such an elaborate hoax under wraps.
The bottom line is that all of the negative reviews posted here are from people who don't agree with the director.  One should not dislike something simply because they don't agree with it!  The fact is that it is a well made, thought provoking film that is guaranteed to test your faith in the powers that be (or were, I guess), and the reason that they hate it so much is because it doesn't fit in to what they want to believe.

1406925,1,B000059MCU,"I knew when I bought this bit of silliness that the science in it would be either suspect, or nonexistent,  but I didn't expect it to be so breathtakingly boring.  The FOX special, though equally bad from a science/logic standpoint, was at least fun to watch.
Mr. Sibrell has so many faults in his reasoning and film footage, that a review of all the errors would be longer than I care to write or that most people would care to read.  Still, here are a few items that should provide some idea of how bad this tape is:
1.  Twice, Sibrell, through the monotone narrator (if I could have watched it with the sound off, I would have), refers to the USSR having the first animal in space.  This is true, of course, but the animal he shows in both cases is a chimp.  The Soviet critter who was first in space was Laika - a dog.  Footage of Laika is easily found.  I've got at least two tapes with her in my own collection.  This is sloppy, lazy production.
2.  Sibrell mentions that the USSR was the first program to accomplish a rendezvous in space.  This is a questionable claim, since the rendezvous in question was really just two orbiting spacecraft passing within a few miles of each other without being in the same orbit.  Still, I'll give it to him.  The problem is that the footage accompanying the claim is of a US rendezvous in the Gemini program.  I suspect he had to use US footage because none exists of the Russian rendezvous (too far apart for pictures).  Still, this is shoddy production.
3.  The cornerstone of his claim is the usual one for ""Moon-Landing Hoax"" proponents:  the Van Allen Belts are too dangerous to fly through.  He claims heavy lead shielding would be necessary to protect the astronauts.  Well, he's right about one thing - the radiation would be lethal to astronauts - if they were traveling naked outside their ship.  The flaw in the reasoning is simple.  All radiation is NOT created equally.  The belts are NOT X-rays or other electromagnetic radiation.  The radiation is PARTICLE radiation (which he acknowledges), which is much easier to shield against.  Did we need shielding?  Yes.  Did it need to be thick lead?  No.
There's plenty more to ridicule, but I'll let it go at that.  I do have my own theory, however:  Since all Sibrell's claims are so easily refuted by even a tiny understanding of science, I don't think even Mr. Sibrell believes this load of manure.  He just hopes enough other people can be duped to make ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"" a good meal ticket for him.
Now, if you want to really learn something, including why hoax proponents claims are nonsense, order Phil Plaitt's book, ""Bad Astronomy.""  It's an entertaining read, and you won't be wasting your time or money.
A postscript to my review (added on Dec. 18. 2003) has to do with an interview or two I've read from Mr. Sibrell.  In these interviews, he changes his claim that the view of the Earth taken through the Apollo CSM window was staged using a round window and a cutout of some sort.  It was pointed out by quite a few people that, if the crew had been filming the Earth from Earth orbit, the land masses and clouds should appear much larger.  In fact, the Earth, in that footage, appears EXACTLY as you'd expect it to from 130,000 miles altitude.  Apparently, Mr. Sibrell agreed.  He now claims the shot was staged using TRANSPARENCIES placed on the window.  Too bad he didn't make that theory up first.
Something else I can't resist regarding the seemingly non-parallel shadows:  Go find a sixth grade art student and have him/her explain the phenomenon of a ""vanishing point,"" then go look at the shadows again.
How the USA managed to pass the Soviets in rocket technology is a matter of history.  After Alexei Leonov's near-fatal first spacewalk, the USSR had exactly zero flights until after the USA's entire Project Gemini was completed.  In Gemini, the US accomplished the first REAL rendezvous, first docking, first changing of orbit during a flight. and two long duration missions in addition to multiple spacewalks.  Then, while our Saturn V booster was operational, the Soviet moon rocket, the N1, was lauched four times - and blew up four times.
I stick by my theory of last year:  Sibrell knows this stuff is nonsense.  He's just making a living pedalling his tape to suckers.",1023667200,28,4333,4.609150326797385
1406926,4,B000059MCU,"Having just watched another ""Did we really go to the Moon?"" program, I decided to revisit this review.
The main thing that struck me having seen interviews with Doubters and NASA spokespeople is that while the Doubters make very specific observations, which they claim suggest a 'faking' of the Moon landings, the NASA people only make generalized denials.
At no time did the principal NASA spokesman take the Doubter's points one by one and answer them directly. Even if you disregard the idea of the Van Allen Belt radiation question, and the flexing or blowing of the flag in a supposed vacuum, a number of points remain problematic.
The main area that simply does not look legit is the area under and around the lander - in every single mission. Even given the relatively minimal thrust used during the final descent, there should have been some kind of blast crater, however shallow, under the lander. This, plus the fact that the lander legs were not in any way embedded in the lunar surface, nor was there any dust etc. on the pristine feet, does make the scene look far too neat and tidy. Like a set.
The other big concern re: the lander is that during the remotely-viewed take-off, there is no visible thrust from the engine, and in take-off mode, there would have been more thrust than in braking to land. It certainly looks more like the unit has been yanked upwards by a cable, as the Doubters suggest.
Equally, the photographs are another problem. Not only does there appear to be more than one light source in many of the photos, as evinced by the shadows falling in different directions, but the clumsy, chest-mounted cameras were such that they could never be aimed with any true precision. Yet somehow all of the lunar photos are beautifully centered, and in crisp focus.
I am not even going to examine the suggestion that Gus Grissom was murdered in the launchpad capsule fire, other than to say that Doubters believe he was about to blow the gaff on the Apollo program, and its inability to complete the job by the end of the decade, due to numerous technical inadequacies. They also believe that other individuals were also killed in case they disclosed sensitive information.
Did the Apollo team reach the Moon, or was it, as has been suggested, filmed on a set in Area 51? At this point, in the absence of disclosure, we cannot be sure, but the hostile reactions to any reviews which suggest that there may be some truth in the video, raise issues in themselves. Either NASA people are angered by the idea that they have been played for chumps, and that the entire program was just a Cold War political sideshow, or they are all getting their buddies to jump on and click ""No"" because they want to suppress even the idea that anybody has the right to question items that are by ANY definition, anomalies.
No, the video does not prove anything definitively, but it does raise many genuinely intelligent questions that NASA have never adequately addressed and which they have refused to take seriously. But then, we all know about the power of Denial, don't we? Governments in all their forms are masters of it.
This issue is far too important for NASA to stonewall it. Forty billion dollars of US taxpayer's money went into the Apollo program. Given this outrageous expense, it is morally unacceptable that NASA should just ignore a series of valid questions, which have not been addressed in more than thirty years. Surely NASA could spend a few grand making their own video in order to step-by-step handle every point raised by the Doubters - while having an open two-way discussion with the principal Doubters. That is, if it is possible to deny the claims of those that doubt the legitimacy of the Moon landings, and assuming that NASA has nothing to hide.
To merely mumble about 'bad science' and ridicule Doubters and describe people as gullible 'nuts', WITHOUT a systematic examination and disproving of the most disturbing of the apparent anomalies, NASA are just proving what many people suspect - that they are so aloof and contemptuous of the public that paid their wages, they are acting as though they are a law unto themselves.
Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE it if NASA would go ahead and effectively disprove the doubts raised by this and other videos. I totally accept that it may be possible for them to do so. Yet in the absence of such a structured analysis, I can only conclude that they are either just too arrogant and contemptuous to feel answerable, or they do indeed have a few skeletons in the closet.",1014768000,24,4550,4.6958698372966206
1406927,4,B000059MCU,"Like it or not, the fact remains that ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"" is a superlatively made, thought-provoking documentary.  It is true that this video often seems more like a generlized, idealistic essay on social injustice and government corruption (did not understand the JFK assassination tie-in), but is well written and replete with enough damning evidence to garner a conviction from the O.J Simpson trial's jury.
I am hardly a savant when it comes to optical principles and concepts but anyone with a video camera can infer that the newly discovered Apollo 11 footage in the video was taken in Earth's orbit, filmed through a circular window, creating the illusion of a distant Earth.  And the continents seeming small, those could easily be small islands that resemble Earth's continents.
Although it does not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the the Apollo missions were faked, still worth buying for the aforementioned never before seen Apollo 11 footage--yes, it is convincing.
Personally, the jury is still deliberating on this controversial topic.  However, comparing the theory to such apocryphal drivel as UFO's, psychics, Bigfoot, etc. is shortsighted.  It would be nothing less than naive to assume that the government, given the motive (which they certainly had), would not perpetrate such a hoax on an unsuspecting population.

1406929,1,B000059MCU,"I've known for a long time that the level of scientific expertise in this nation is poor, but never have I seen so amptly proven. Obviously in a desperate attempt to make money, Bart W. Sibrel has created this 47-minute documentary, which ranges from unsubstantiated and conjectural at the best to completely ridiculous and downright humorous at the worst.  I laughed my way through most of this, and also through the ludicrous FOX documentary which was broadcast on Thursday, February 15.  After both programs, I told myself that the sensationalist garbage convinced me more than ever that we have landed on the moon during the Apollo program.
Sibrel is one of the more amusing conspiracy theorists involved in this issue, and he proves it in this video.  Most of the so-called ""evidence"" that is put forth as evidence of a faked lunar landing is not new or damning, and can easily be explained by a high school student with a basic physics book.  However, a great deal has been made out of the new video footage which ""proves"" that Apollo 11, and astronauts Neil Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, never left earth orbit.  Actually, this video is nothing more than footage of Apollo 11's second telecast from space, while on their way to the moon.  Aldrin is moving the camera, and panning back at the earth; if this footage were taken from earth orbit, we would see the clouds and land formations changing.  However, since the earth remains completely still, it is obviously viewing the earth as a globe, and are making their way to the moon in the command module Columbia.  Sibrel, ever the rational thinker, claims that the footage was taken using cardboard to give the impression that they were far away from earth, when they were really only at an altitude of 250 miles, in earth orbit.  This is quite a fantasy, and it could only be concocted by someone with very little real knowledge in spaceflight and the Apollo lunar landings.
Thus, I remain convinced, and always will be, that twenty-four Apollo astronauts have indeed sailed the translunar gulf.  Sibrel can keep fooling himself for as long as he pleases, and can continue to try to make money off the gullible and uninformed, but I will always know the truth of this matter.

Sibrel (the man behind the scam) brings up the same tired old arguments, all discredited; the Van Allen Belt, no stars in the photos, diverging shadows, etc.
Next, there is a supposedly 'newly discovered' video clip that shows the astronauts still in orbit when they should have been nearing the moon. The video takes pains to point out how the astronauts used a piece of cardboard, cut into a circle, to mask the earth in a window so it would look like it was small, and, therfore, far away, when it actually filled the window (because he claims they were still in orbit).
But honestly, I could NEVER see what they were talking about. The earth is obviously shown fully in the clip, because you can easily make out the continents and cloud cover. Also, if you look at the earth from orbit, you see it moving quite rapidly below you. But the shots this video shows are completely still.

  ""Flag flapping in the wind"" - The astronaut had his hand on the flag pole the entire time 'and' was moving around the whole time, probably using the pole to help steady himself.  That would tend to shake a flimsy flag attached to a flimsy flag pole.
  ""Some shadows are pitch dark, but in others you can see an astronaut"" - You get the same effect on Earth.

In a way, like nave Adam and Eve, you can't blame people for initially being deceived, after all, which is a more pleasant realm to live in, one in which your country or world continually lies about science, integrity and spending, or one in which your country or world is scientifically unsurpassed, honorable and financially honest?  Naturally, people almost always seem to see the latter because this is the kind of realm they would rather live in.

Personally, if I had cancer, I would want to know about it rather than pretending that I didn't have it.  (Obviously though, some people prefer being lied to with pleasantries.)  While pretending that I wasn't diseased would temporarily pacify my emotions, it would also unabatedly spread the disease, potentially to fatality, because I ignored it.  On the other hand, while finding out that you have cancer is quite depressing, you can at least plan according to reality instead of fantasy, and perhaps actually accomplish more with this information, knowing that you have limited opportunity to change your life for the better.

When I ask leading ""intellectuals"" why they will not even briefly consider just the possibility of a moon landing fraud, they say ""No one would do such a thing.""  (That is to say, no one would be that audaciously wicked.)  My argument is that in a world full of genocide, murder, rape, theft, mutilations and molestations, is merely lying about a scientific accomplishment so farfetched?  After all, haven't Nobel laureates in the past been forced to give back their medals for plagiarism and deceit?  Yes, they have!

These type of people who vehemently oppose the admission of a cover-up regarding the Apollo ""moon"" landings, with endorsements of felony violence to defend and maintain a corruptive status quo, have openly admitted, time and time again, that if firsthand eyewitness Neil Armstrong himself had went on national television and confessed to the cover-up prior to his death, they would still believe that the moon landings were real, when he was there and they were not! . . . Who then is mentally deficient, as they claim the conspiracy theorists are regarding this?  These people will not even consider for one second, even the possibility, that the alleged manned moon missions were a cold war deception to inflate the appearance of American military superiority, as well as pacify rampant disgruntled domestic revolt during the Vietnam war, so how can the opinions of such close-minded people be trusted in the first place?  The supposed manned moon missions are a religion to them . . . and a false one at that.  (See  2nd Thessalonians  2: 9-12)

Hitler, the master of deception, said that it was actually easier to get away with a gigantic lie than a small one, because small lies are so common and therefore anticipated, so that no one would expect the audacity of a grand deception.  This is precisely the psychological tactic that was used in precipitating and maintaining the monumental, yet very simple, lie of the manned moon landings . . . with 1960's technology.  Again, a feat that cannot even be done today!

Never before in the entire history of the world did such an historical event have absolutely no independent press coverage.  Why do investigators overlook this most telling piece of evidence?  Only three government employee eyewitnesses to the ""greatest event in history""?  Whatever completely government controlled and edited photographs and images were given to the press were blindly assumed to be authenticated by the ""credible"" Nixon administration.  It is like giving a whining child cake for dinner to appease them and then expecting them to argue with you demanding broccoli instead!

The Vietnam War during the alleged moon missions was destroying the country from within by its divisiveness and civil protests.  Nixon repeatedly said so himself, thinking that this mounting public discontent might actually lead to real anarchy, rebellion and the disintegration of the government, not to mention his precious egotistical cushy job!  A unifying pep rally of a successful moon landing was just what the American patient needed!  Do you really think that Nixon was going to risk killing three national ""heroes"" on ""live"" worldwide television during his presidency when simply failing to rescue kidnapped hostages would ruin you for life as it did president Carter a few years later?  How could he absolutely guarantee a successful moon mission? . . . To stage it! . . . Not to mention that it was technologically impossible at the time to begin with.  In fact, according to NASA contractor William Kaysing, who worked for six years on the Apollo program, a classified interdepartmental memo, which he personally read and proofed, estimated the likelihood of a successful manned mission on the first attempt at a mere one in ten thousand chance.

Some assume that if the Soviet Union or Chinese intelligence agencies found out that the American moon landings were fraudulent they would ""spill the beans"" to the rest of the world.  This is simply not true, and again, thinking only one step farther than programmed to do reveals the truth.  If wars are created for the profiteering of the ""Military Industrial Complex"", as many forward thinking people including president Eisenhower now realize, then ""adversaries"" of America are merely imaginary, created for profitable ends by the billionaires pulling the strings behind the scenes, who have been making money off of war, ""cold"" or otherwise, just as Eisenhower warned, since world war one.  (Think about it: America has been at war, nonstop, since the end of world war two, more than seventy years ago!)  As such, the Soviet Union and China are, in fact, in-league with the United States government, despite mainstream media appearances.  (Just imagine a fake wrestling match.)  This being the case, these overseas entities would not bring the truth of such an American scandal into the light to injure their co-conspirator brother.  Any ""bad blood"" the United States appears to have with foreign powers is merely staged for the very purpose of keeping their complicity a secret.

Even if these two ""super-powers"" were actual enemies of America, they still would not expose the truth about the moon missions.  For example, if I had a picture of the president with a prostitute, would it be more profitable for me to give it away free to the press corps, or to blackmail him year after year with ever increasing tolls until the day he died?  If such countries really were enemies of America and had proof of the moon landing fraud, it would serve their interests much more to keep such knowledge to themselves and blackmail America, year after year, administration after administration, to get the behind-the-scenes negotiations to favor them, whether it regarded trade, arms, debt, or anything else they so desired.

There were, in fact, no ""independent"" tracking stations for the Apollo missions.  The only entities that had such capability were the United State's own government agencies (who were complicit in the cover-up) and the aforementioned countries, who profited from keeping the secret.  Additionally, NASA launched the ""Tetra-A"" satellite shortly before the Apollo missions to simulate transmissions coming from the moon so that their ground crews could rehearse the ""moon landings"" during their many simulations.  Conveniently, it was purported that the Tetra-A satellite ""accidently burned up"" in the earth's atmosphere just before the first moon mission, that way the government satellite could secretly still be in service, performing the same simulation function during the ""real"" flights.  Furthermore, retired ground crew members recently acknowledged that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a ""real"" and a ""simulated"" moon mission.

From Wikipedia regarding The Apollo Fraud:

""Some people insist that the Apollo moon landings were a cold war deception of the Nixon administration.  However, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did occur.  Anyone on earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can apparently bounce laser beams off three retro-reflector arrays reported to be left on the moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15, suggesting deployment of the lunar laser ranging equipment at asserted Apollo moon landing sites, implying equipment constructed on earth was transported to the surface of the moon.  In addition, in August 2009, NASA's lunar reconnaissance orbiter claimed to send back high resolution photos of the estimated Apollo landing sites.  These government issued pictures show not only what is reported to be the faint shadows of the descent stages of the lunar landers allegedly left behind, but also apparent tracks of the astronauts' walking paths nearby in the lunar dust.""

At first (and only) glance, these appear to be relevant arguments, yet each one is, surprisingly, most easily and unconditionally refuted with only a modicum amount of further investigation beyond initial conditioned interpretation.  First of all, it has recently come to light through ""whistling blowing"" intelligence employees that ""Wikipedia"" is a mainstream, establishment supported, parasitical organism used rampantly for propaganda purposes by multiple government agencies such as the NSA, as they can anonymously post intelligent sounding pro-government thesis to the masses, often deliberately contradicting and smugly belittling more truthful ""conspiracy theories"" of very real crimes of the authorities in power, whose express purpose of these writings is to cover-up and deflect attention away from their own illegal and unholy behavior.  (See the Sleuth Journal article on this topic at the end of this writing.)  When they use words like ""empirical evidence is readily available to show that the manned moon landings did occur"" . . . It not only shows their arrogance (which, in and of itself, demonstrates their blindness to the facts), it also exemplifies their desperation to make an argument that is so much losing ground that they have to resort to the administration in power tactic that if you don't agree with them you are somehow deficient in intelligence.

It was proven in 1962 that a laser can be bounced and calibrated off of the moon without a man made reflector thereon simply due to the reflectivity of the lunar surface.  Secondly, Russia put a manmade mirror on the moon's surface during the time of the Apollo missions for this same claimed purpose, using instead an un-manned probe that would not have to suffer the biological ravages of lethal space radiation.  (See the March 1959 issue, Volume 200, Number 3, of the magazine ""Scientific American"", article entitled ""Radiation Belts Around the Earth"", to see how deadly and impenetrable space radiation is beyond the safety of low earth orbit where the space station currently resides, at an altitude of merely 205 miles above the earth . . . The moon being about 239,000 miles away.)  Thirdly, seeing how all of these lasers have their data computer controlled, it would only take one computer hacker, if they so desired, to manipulate the data shown on a scientist's viewing monitor, which they would then wrongly assume to be truthful.  (This was precisely the case at ""mission control"" during the ""moon"" missions, where dozens of computer ""operators"", who actually just read the preprogrammed data screens like news anchors who do not write their own words, openly admitted, after the fact, that they could tell no difference whatsoever between a flight ""simulation"" and a ""real"" flight.)

To say that additional ""new"" photographs from the criminal NASA are evidence that ""prove"" the moon landings were real is laughable.  They already faked high resolution, full body pictures of an ""astronaut"" standing right on the ""moon's surface"" nearly fifty years ago, so what is it to fake additional pictures now, with almost five decades better technology, of such simple things such as tiny shadows or scratches on lunar satellite photographs that are supposed to be from human foot tracks or Apollo lunar landers?  These diehard believers are just seeing what they want to see, like a nave spouse of a cheating partner, accepting the fox's evidence that they didn't steal a chicken.

Additional arguments against the fraud are reported to be the hundreds of thousands of people throughout industry who contributed to the missions, who allegedly would have had to have been informed of and kept the secret.  Again, seemingly a good argument, yet it is not with only a little extra thought and investigation.  Do you really think the CIA was stupid enough to tell hundreds of thousands of contractors the goings-on of a top-top-secret project?  Would the CIA really be so careless as to tell the person making the rocket's door handle, or the glove or the boot of the spacesuit, that they were actually faking the moon landings?  Do we really think the CIA is that stupid to tell so many low level people? Furthermore, to say that because my uncle worked at NASA and believed the moon landings were real, is proof that they were real, is like saying that because my uncle worked as a vender at the Super Bowl and believes that the game was honest, is proof that the football players didn't cheat to win!  How then can this be a genuine argument against the fraud?  Surely the government officials making this statement realize this and are deliberately trying to mislead the public away from the truth, like a profiteering shepherd herding their nave unwitting sheep to the slaughterhouse.

Just like a pyramid of power in any business, what the employee, the manager, and the regional manager knows about the business' actual agenda, is completely different than what the CEO at the very top knows.  Remember, there were only three people (""trusted"" government employees) who were actually there at the time.  As you will see in my film ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"" (the link follows this article), the three crew members were indeed on the rocket, they did launch into earth orbit (to attain realistic ""zero gravity"" flight photography), they did splash down in the ocean (to add to the realism), yet the rest, everything beyond earth orbit (which is only what they can do today), was completely contrived, like a masterful illusionist, by satellite data manipulation, complete media control, and professional movie sets.  After all, what is easier to do, actually build a rocket and travel to another planet with 1960's technology on the first attempt without killing anyone, or simply make a movie about it?  The age old argument ""The simplest explanation is the true one"", which many ""Apollo proponents"" use to suggest the missions authenticity, actually proves the fraud instead!  The simple fact is that it is easier to fake a moon mission than to actually do one . . . otherwise there would be manned bases there by now!

Some of the best evidence supporting the fraud is the fact that in 1998, when the space shuttle flew to its highest altitude ever, three hundred sixty-five miles, one third higher than they normally flew, they were asked to descend to a lower altitude by mission control due to lethal space radiation they encountered by approaching too close to the ""Van Allen Radiation Belts"", which don't even begin until one thousand miles altitude (and continue for an additional twenty-five thousand miles).  That is to say, they were six hundred thirty-five miles away from radiation that was so intense that they reported they could see the radiation with their eyes closed as sparks of light hitting the retinas of their shaded eyes.  When this happened, CNN inadvertently reported this fact by saying, ""The radiation belt surrounding earth is more dangerous than previously believed.""  Apparently not a single journalist on the entire planet figured out, except for myself, that this statement totally contradicts the authenticity of the moon landings!  Here's why:

The only time in world history human beings are said to have traveled through the twenty-five thousand mile thick radiation field called the ""Van Allen Radiation Belts"", which unbeknownst to most surrounds earth starting at an altitude of one thousand miles and extends twenty-five thousand miles beyond that, is during the alleged moon missions.  Why is it then that astronauts some six hundred thirty-five miles away from this radiation, twenty-nine years later, know more about the radiation than the Apollo astronauts who claimed they were in the middle of it eighteen times to the moon and back?

Remember, the recent discovery proves that the radiation is . . . ""more dangerous than previously believed"".  What is ""previously believed"" if not based on the previous reports from the ""experts"" of the radiation, the Apollo crews, who were allegedly the only ones in all of world history to have ever traveled through the radiation (and eighteen times at that, to the moon and back), all with no ill effects and no reports of any kind of the visible sparks of radiation being seen, as were later reported by the space shuttle crew from hundreds of miles away, not even in the middle of it as the Apollo crews supposedly were!  Again, how can people six hundred thirty-five miles away from radiation they have never traveled through or even to, know more about it than people who were allegedly in the middle of it eighteen times?!

Of course, this is simply not possible.

What does this mean?  It means that the people who claimed to have previously been inside the radiation field lied about being there!  Of course too, if the ""Apollo"" crews never went through the Van Allen Radiation Belt as this contradictory report reveals, then they certainly could not have gone to the moon either, which the traversing of this radiation would require!  Why does no one connect the dots with this very revealing information except me?  Because the dots lead to a horrific truth that would break the spirit of the entire American nation if they knew, proving that most people would rather believe a pleasurable lie, than a painful truth.

In fact, when I discovered absolute proof (actual, on camera evidence) that the Apollo astronauts never left earth orbit (contained in a newly discovered unedited NASA reel which was never broadcast to the public; debuted in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"") and showed this controversial videotape to a news director at NBC, he turned pale white, practically fainted as he collapsed in his chair and exclaimed, ""Oh, my God!  It looks like we didn't go to the moon!""  ""I know"", I said, ""What do we do?""  This man, who held the betterment of America in his hand, thought for a long while . . . and then eventually ""chickened out"".  He said, ""I cannot broadcast this with a clear conscious.  It will cause a civil war.  I will not be the one responsible for that.""  While I disagree that the public knowing the truth about the moon missions would cause a civil war, they would probably demand governmental reform and start investigating other matters of corruption and deception.  Naturally, criminals would rather not get caught and preserve their way of life that reform would inevitably dismantle.

Oddly enough, when Bush Jr. was president, he went on national television and proclaimed that ""The United States will return to the moon as a logical first step to Mars and beyond"".  Did no one besides me notice that if they really already went to the moon six times, why would they need to do a ""first"" step over again for the seventh time?  He was even so bold as to go on to say that ""First we will need to learn how to protect the astronauts from lethal space radiation.""  Am I the only one curious enough to ask, ""Why not do it the same way that worked so good the first time they went to the moon?""

In August of 2009 it was reported, albeit as a news oddity (and it certainly was) that a ""moon rock"" personally given to the president of the Netherlands by Neil Armstrong in 1969, who supposedly hand picked it off of the ""moon's"" surface himself, was opened forty years later from its hermitically sealed container by a curious museum curator after he had watched ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"".  Following microscopic examination, the rock was verified to actually be a deceptively authentic looking piece of petrified wood instead!  Yet again, not a single journalist, except for myself, asked the question, ""If the moon rocks are fraudulent, what about the moon missions?""

If more people would only view with an open, deprogrammed mind, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"", which contains newly discovered video evidence of the moon landing fraud, they would see with their own eyes recently uncovered unedited behind-the-scenes outtakes of false photography of the ""moon missions"".  The scene contained therein has never been broadcast to the public.  In it, Neil Armstrong is using a one foot diameter model of the earth, from low earth orbit, to create the illusion for the television viewers, that he and his crew are half way to the moon, when they are, in fact, still in earth orbit.  This is absolute proof that, though they were on the rocket in low earth orbit, the crew never went any further due to lethal space radiation.

This footage is even dated by NASA's own computer clock as having taken place two days into Armstrong's flight, when he is supposed to be half way to the moon, or some 135,000 miles away from the earth, yet he and his crew are clearly shown (in these newly discovered unedited outtakes of the broadcast) to still be in earth orbit, and are instead, falsifying the television photography to deceive the viewing public of their real location.  The CIA is even heard on a private, third audio channel, prompting Armstrong to respond to Mission Control's questions only after four seconds have elapsed, in order to create the false impression of an increased radio delay, so as to appear much farther from the earth than he and his crew actually were.  Jump ahead to time  32:02  in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon"" if you do not wish to view the entire forty seven minute documentary and only see the newly discovered unedited out-takes of Neil Armstrong falsifying mission photography during the historic and now infamous mission.

Recently, a website detractor to the obviousness of this fraud shown in the newly discovered footage debuted in my film, suggested that because I only showed excerpts of this condemning footage in the documentary, that I somehow tricked people into thinking that the clearly heard third track of CIA audio and the blatantness of the one foot diameter sized mocked-up model of the earth, was something other than a deliberate lie.  Seeing how my program is only forty-five minutes long and the unedited falsified footage reel is an hour in length, I deemed it quite logical and appropriate to show, in the most timely manner possible, the segments of the fraudulent video which displayed the most apparent falsification, editing from one such clip to the other.  According to this misleading and false accusatory thinking, showing only the highlights of a football game negates the winning team's victory.  As such, the one making this baseless accusation is the one guilty of deceiving his audience.

If the moon landings, which were done with such ease on the first attempt with 1960's technology, though they cannot be duplicated toady with nearly fifty years more advanced technology, are so obviously real, then anyone who says otherwise is an idiot.  Why then are there hundreds of websites, with tens of thousands of hours spent on their construction, in existence to refute the insane rantings of morons?  As Shakespeare so famously said, ""Thou does protest too much.""  Another historical commentator said this, ""The likelihood of one individual being right, increases in direct proportion to the intensity with which others are trying to prove him wrong.""

Even former president Clinton, once holding the (allegedly) highest office in the land, doubts the authenticity of the moon landings.  On Page 156 of his biography ""My Life"" he states:
""Just a month before, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague, Michael Collins, aboard spaceship Columbia and 'walked on the moon', beating by five months President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon before the decade was out. The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened.  I said sure, I saw it on television. He disagreed; he said that he didn't believe it for a minute, that 'them television fellers' could make things look real that weren't. Back then, I thought he was a crank. During my eight years in Washington, I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time.""

If a president of the United States is finally admitting his doubts as to the authenticity of the ""moon landings"" (albeit, after he safely left office) and is calling those who perceive the truth of the event ""ahead of their time"", shouldn't you also reconsider your thinking on the matter, if you haven't already?

When it comes to perceiving the truth in a world full of lies, historically, the majority has always been deceived, and later proved wrong, by the minority of their contemporaries, whom they persecuted and considered deceived at the time, when in fact it was they who were deceived.  Does a person know it when they are deceived?  No, they do not.  They defend the lie with red faces and clinched teeth.

The majority of scientists thought the world was flat, the majority of astronomers thought the earth was the center of the universe, the majority of physicians thought bleeding the sickness out of a person was a cure, the majority of congressmen thought Nixon was honest, and a majority of scientists, astronomers, physicians, and congressmen think the moon landings were real, yet their titles and majority do not equal truth, as history has well proven, and will prove again.

Why is it so difficult for them to see the truth?  Very simple . . . Pride.

""The Pride of your heart has deceived you.""

Obadiah 1:3

Pride is simply the unwillingness to be wrong, just as humility is the willingness to be wrong.  The great thing about being wrong, which is what I had to finally admit about the moon landings, is that I am learning something new, and I am no longer walking through life in error.  The bad thing about being right all the time, is that I cannot learn anything new, and I am living my life in a self-deceived state, which is the very worst form of deception.  When someone else deceives me, if I try hard enough, I can eventually figure it out, after all, I know that other people cannot be trusted all of the time.  Yet when I am self-deceived, it is nearly impossible to overcome, because the person I am relying on for ""facts"" is myself, and of course I can trust myself! . . . even when I am wrong.

When someone considers themself smart, this is the first step towards their ignorance.  They boast about their years of experience and degrees, and thereby pour concrete around their finite knowledge, unawaringly calling their stone mound of limited facts, the entire universe of truth.  If you try to tell them they are wrong, they will defend their post to their emotional and intellectual death at all cost, all the while attempting to defile you with their venomous words for pointing out their mistake, even if you are right, just like those previously mentioned throughout history.

Just like OJ Simpson's lawyers, who later admitted they knew of his guilt and were only ""doing their job"", no matter how plain the evidence, their deceptive lawyer-like minds have an explanation for why facts are fictions, and fictions are facts.  With every evidence I submit as to why the moon landings were falsified, no matter how condemning, there is always a zealous pride-filled counterpart to throw away the truth and institute a lie in its place, with each and every piece of factual evidence, just like OJ Simpson's defenders.  Just because someone has an explanation for something, or everything, does not mean that the explanation is true.

Rather than looking for the truth, even at the cost of being wrong, the majority of people, because of their blinding pride in the accomplishments of themselves and like-minded others, instead ""Gather around them a great number of teachers to tell them what their itching ears want to hear"".  (2nd Timothy 4:3)  In other words, rather than looking for the truth, they look for people to agree with what they already believe, so as to prove themselves right.

The extremely simple fact is this: After Columbus traveled to the new world, everyone else traveled to the new world.  After Lewis and Clark traveled to the American west, everyone else traveled to the American west.  After the Wright brothers accomplished powered flight, everyone else did immediately thereafter.

Lindbergh first flew across the Atlantic in an airplane in 1927.  Five decades later there were millions of airplanes flying across the Atlantic.  Soon it will be five decades since America allegedly had men leisurely playing golf on the moon in complete safety with 1960's technology, all on the first attempt.  In comparison, the 747 aircraft, built after seventy years of successful aviation history and millions of manufactured aircraft, was developed at the very same time as the ""Apollo"" spacecraft, the first ever vehicle to take men to another planet, yet it took one year longer to construct and made over 160 failed attempts before it finally got off of the ground!

Interestingly, more computing power today is found in a ten dollar watch than was in the entire Apollo program, including the entire spacecraft and all of the computers at ""Houston Control"", and yet for some reason, no one, from any nation on earth, has been able to go to the moon and survive, not even ONCE, with five decades more advanced technology . . . WHY? . . . There is only ONE possible answer . . . (It is soooooooo simple, yet people refuse to see the unpleasant truth) . . . Because it cannot be done . . . Even today!

If all the scientists from all the nations on earth cannot go to the moon today with all the newer technology that the 21st century has to offer, it simply means, and it cannot mean anything else, that America did not go to the moon in the 1960's.  Again, Technology does not go backwards!  It is sooooo obvious to anyone with an open mind who does not have a religious attachment to the event.

Just as Hitler's children, if he had any, would have a hard time seeing dear old papa as anything but a benevolent patriarch, mired tunnel-visioned ""intellectuals"" and misdirected beguiled ""patriots"" will seldom admit that their enamored ""scientific"" community and ""glorious"" government can be just as corrupt as pedophile priest.

""God opposes the proud, yet gives grace to the humble.""

the more it will hate those who speak it.""
