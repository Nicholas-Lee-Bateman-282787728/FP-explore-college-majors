4464411,4,B004SRTKO8,The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra are a world renowned ensemble who do an amazing job of showcasing not only their own talents but the talented violinist Joshua Bell as well.  This DVD features a live performance in Stockholm's Concert Hall and is not only a fantastic recording but the sound quality is amazing as well.  Bell's performance surrounded by the orchestra's performance will have you standing in ovation by the end of the live performance DVD.,1308873600,6,465,5.105263157894737
4464412,5,B004SRTKO8,"Being an ardent devotee of neglected Romantic-era composers and their long-forgotten works, I approached this DVD somewhat reluctantly, if only because its contents, Beethoven's ""Leonora"" Overture No. 3, Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, and Sibelius's Fifth Symphony, are so popular, and are heard so often in concerts, that I would rather not hear them so often.
I have to admit that I was completely bowled over! The Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo elicits wonderful performances from the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, and violinist Joshua Bell gives an excellent performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. The live performance, in Stockholm's Konserthus (concert hall), is a joy to watch, and Joshua Bell was given a (mostly) standing ovation for his performance of the Tchaikovsky. The sound quality is excellent. The program notes (in English, French, and German) give very little information on the three works, but instead focus on the struggles and triumphs of the three composers against various forms of opposition and hostility that they, or their subject matter (Leonora and her politically imprisioned husband Florestan in the case of the ""Leonora"" Overture) had to face. Thus, these three works are tied to the concept behind the Nobel Prize, which is awarded only to those who have stood up for their beliefs in the face of political power.

4464413,5,B004SRTKO8,"For many listeners, Joshua Bell may be the main attraction on this disk. And he is very, very good indeed. As Clive Goodwin expertly states, this is a highly charged ""romantic"" reading of the Tchaikovsky concerto, portamenti galore, high gloss and all. If you seek the depth and desperation, the poignant melancholy in Tchaikovsky's music, this may not be for you. In itself, however, it is absolutely irresistible and very deserving of the standing ovation, even from the Swedish Royal family. The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra -- a world-class ensemble -- and the Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo give perfect support to Bell. Both the flanking works, the third Leonore Overture (with valveless period trumpets!) and the Sibelius Fifth are exceptional in every respect. The Beethoven is heaven storming and finely shaded in its various moods and dynamics, the Sibelius symphony stunningly powerful and idiomatic: for me the high point of the concert. It brings to mind long gone great LP interpretations of Alexander Gibson et al. You can find no better reading of this symphony in any medium today. Outstanding audio and video as well as interviews with Bell and Oramo make this a first choice of the season.",1308009600,19,1218,5.125628140703518
4464414,5,B004SRTKO8,"The Tchaikovsky is obviously a showpiece for a great fiddler, and that's what Bell is. He really plays the hell out of this piece,just nudging my erstwhile favorite, Viktor Tretyakov, into second place (This latter is part of the Fedoseyev/Moscow Tchaikovsky cycle).

The Strad that Bell uses had belonged to Huberman, one of the major violinists of the early twentieth century. I have this piece played by Huberman on a Naxos historical CD, and he reflected the style of that period, which was to use lots of portamento (string slides instead of discreet notes). I am happy to report that Bell does this also, which really adds to the flavor of the concerto. The cadenza is brilliantly done, and the slow movement is nice and ""schmaltzy"", as it should be.

The Swedish orchestra easily keeps up with Bell, aided by great direction from Sakari Oramo, a conductor with whom I'm not familiar, but can't wait to hear more of. Oramo works wonders with the other two works on this disc, a thrilling Leonore Overture #3, and a simply superb Sibelius #5 Symphony. This piece should make your hair stand on end (if you have any!)and this performance surely does.  The only other 5th. by itself is the awful Salonen/Verbier disc. There is a great Bernstein set with the Vienna Phil. that's worth having, but the sound and picture are dated.

This is one of the few concert discs released where all the works are worth hearing, and all performances are excellent.

Interviews with Bell and Oramo are interesting. I didn't listen to the one given by the Nobel recipient, Llosa, yet.

I must say that the company ACCENTUS seems to be doing a consistently better job than discs put out on the Euroarts label, in content, sound and video.",1307577600,52,1724,4.749163879598663
4464415,5,B004SRTKO8,"This is a way to have Joshua Bell perform this amazing violin concerto every time you want to see it.

4464420,5,B004SRTKO8,The sound track is excellent. The selections chosen for the DVD are great and in my opinion Joshua Bell is one the best violinist of today.,1351555200,,139,4.384615384615385
4464421,5,B004SRTKO8,"I'm a longtime music lover and I enjoy going to the local symphony concerts.  There the soloists, especially the violin soloists, are a big part of the enjoyment and excitement.  It occurred to me that a Blu-ray system might help my interest and enjoyment of virtuoso violin performances and so I was glad to receive this disc from Amazon to play on my system.  In short, it is marvelous.  The sound engineering and camera work in the production are superb and represent the performance in a most satisfying way that I have wanted from Blu-ray but that not all productions deliver.  Mr. Bell is a wonder.  His energy and skill and musicality and beauty absolutely thrill me as I watch and listen.  The conductor is a treasure and added considerably to my enjoyment.  I understand people have their favorite renditions and performers so there is no one best, but this must be one of the best.  The bonus tracks are very interesting.  I highly recommend this production and performance.",1349827200,3,984,4.769230769230769
4464422,2,B004SRTKO8,"Mr. Bell pops up almost non stop everywhere. I have never seen a performer of his statue so over exposed. He may have all the technical skills of playing violin, there really is no music making here. He plays like a teen ager, with no musical maturity. Further, his over active body movement is a real distraction.",1346544000,5,314,4.526315789473684
4464423,2,B004SRTKO8,"Joshua Bell despite playing a Strad is devoid of all emotion.  He plays on Evah Pirazzi strings that lack all the overtones of metal wound gut strings like Eudoxa or Olive strings.  He can play loud but that is not the intention of the composers.  Evah Pirazzi strings have dynamics that go from loud to louder. It is disappointing that his playing is so metallic and devoid of overtones.  Old instruments like the Strad he plays were meant to be played with metal wound gut strings like Heifetz and Milstein played.  In fact Milstein played a pure gut A and metal wound D and G strings.

Hillary Hahn strives much more for the old and compelling sound that is lost in modern performers.  As someone who plays the violin himself Joshua Bell's performances leave me cold.  I grew up listening to Heifetz and Milstein in performance.  Unfortunately many modern string players have lost the elegance and emotion of past performances.  Bell's violin costs about 4-5 million dollars.  If one chooses synthetic strings then Dominants or Obligato strings would be a much better choice.  The full bodied sound that his violin is capable of is lost both by his choice of strings and style of playing.  The sound is thin and devoid of overtones. I would not recommend this issue.",1344556800,4,1269,4.739726027397261
4464424,5,B004SRTKO8,"Others have and will comment upon the musical pieces and the skill of the performers.  Bell lovers will gush, and Bell detractors will grump.

My point is to review the disc as a video product.  It is supurb; the best I have ever seen of a classical full-orchestra performance.  I don't know how many cameras and microphones Accentus, the producing entity had working (it must have been a large number), but the editing is wonderful.  The final edit allows you to observe up close and marvel at the bowing, finger work, and effort of Bell on the Tchaikovsky concerto, while at the same time picking up the nuance of the music, the contributions of individual instruments from within the orchestra.  The ""play"" of the final product across the entire orchestra, and between soloist and orchestra, was seamless.

I do not have a first class sound system attached to my TV, so all I can say about the sound quality is that, on my TV it sounded excellent.

If you want a concert DVD that allows you an intimate, exhilarating view of both soloist and orchestra, this DVD is for you.",1338076800,4,1076,4.626315789473685
4464425,5,B004SRTKO8,"I greatly enjoy this disc - Joshua Bell is always brilliant when he plays the Tchaikovsky concerto, and Sakari Oramo and his Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra are fabulous throughout the performance. Other reviewers have said a great deal about the merits of the disc; here I want to comment on some of the things other reviewers said about Joshua Bell's music-making.

I find it interesting that some listeners take issue with Joshua Bell's interpretations in general because they don't sound ""deep"". You see, that's the issue I have with some classical music listeners; does music have to be ""deep"", ""profound"", or ""thought-evoking"" to be enjoyable, or to be great music? There seems to be this assumption that a musician is only good if he makes the music sound deep. It seems that our age of music listening is, sadly, more about instructing than enjoying. And really, who are we to say how a piece of music is supposed to be played? More often I find that when a critic criticizes a certain player's interpretation, the review speaks more of the critic's own ego than anything else.

To me a great musician makes his listeners enjoy the music, and in my opinion, Bell is one of those musicians. Over the years, he has made his sound more and more refined, and achieved this tonal unity that's quite remarkable and unique. He has a big palette of colors when he needs it, but more often you hear this pure, slender and focused tone, with only subtle variation in timbre throughout the pitch range. That's the thing I love the most about Bell's violin sound - he keeps the tone perfectly in control, so when he does vary it, it has great effect on the music expression. His playing is subtle; he doesn't saw out scratchy pizzicati to make one notice how fast he plays, doesn't make bombastic sounds to show his effort, or use blistering high notes to remind the listeners that he has soul. He doesn't set out to make his interpretations different from the others, and that's exactly why I like them - everything sounds natural, and there isn't any of those quirks that often mark many violinists' so-called personal ""interpretations"". His interpretations are often balletic, full of dancing rhythm, like light hovering high in the air. There is hardly real darkness; and no, they are not the most ""profound"" interpretations - they don't make you think about the meaning of your existence, or questions about life and death. But music isn't all about life-and-death questions. I remember Bell said in an interview that he made music for its beauty, and he disagreed with the idea that music must reflect the ugliness in the real world (""people wrote the most beautiful music in the ugliest time"", how true). In this sense, he has achieved exactly what he wanted; in his music, everything is beautiful, almost too much so.

For listeners who accept Bell's music-making in its own terms, they would for sure be rewarded with a great experience of ravishingly beautiful music. And for listeners who don't appreciate Bell's philosophy - well, you have plenty other musicians to listen to.",1332979200,7,3091,4.8283018867924525
4464426,5,B004SRTKO8,"Whilst I had only heard Joshua Bell on the soundtract of ""Ladies in Lavender"" I had not seen him. This is an outstanding concert - he is the consummate performer on his old valuable Strad, and the obvious rapport between him and the conductor and orchestra is great. Highly recommended for classical fans.",1328659200,,305,4.773584905660377

4464428,5,B004SRTKO8,"Truly one of the world's most accomplished and gifted musicians, Joshua Bell can be appreciated even more by watching his mastery in this recording. Having seen him play the Tchaikovsky twice in person, this recording provides the added benefit of seeing his technical expertise and passion up close. The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra provides superb accompaniment and performances of Beethoven's Leonore Overture and Sibelius' 5th. My only regret is that a Blu-ray, HD format of this title is not available.",1314489600,4,517,5.475

4464431,5,B004SRTKO8,"The bluray is a Nobel Prize concert held in Stockholm in honour of the 2010 Nobel Laureates. There is an interview on the disc with 2010 Nobel Laureate for literature, Mario Vargas llosa. The Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, is conducted by Sakari Oramo, who is Finnish.  Beethovens Leonore Overture No 3 in C Major starts off the concert. The Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in D Major, is played by  Joshua Bell, who sways and dances with his Violin. He does not stand still. I like this form of playing. This shows that he is emotionally involved and is playing with passion. The Orchestra backing him plays the tempo that is required, not slow, but fast. It is a tour de force. The audience thought so too, they would not let him go at the end of the piece.

Jean Sibelius Symphony no 5 in E flat major,is conducted again not only with passion, but the Finn Oramo, seems to get right inside the piece and bring out the themes. I keep going back to this piece, because Oramo conducts it just right and brings out the energy and the Finnish landscape which Sibelius has painted in his Symphony No 5. A blu ray I can recommend to add to your collection.",1313798400,5,1157,4.5
4464432,5,B004SRTKO8,"The Nobel Prize Concert is something all music lovers would like to attend in that it often showcases music that provides the foundation for the concept of the Nobel Peace Prize.  This concert has not only been captured sonically, but also visually, a factor that makes the performance by guest soloist Joshua Bell a treasure.

Sakari Oramo is a dashing, expressive conductor and he obviously has the devotion of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra secured.  He opens the concert with an uplifting Leonore Overture #3 by Beethoven.  Then it is the exceptionally photogenic Joshua Bell who enters the stage and gives an all out performance of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. Yes, there is evidence that he is aware that his performance is being taped in that his emotional expressions seem a bit over the top at times, but his performance (with Oramo's fine collaboration) is a solid one and his command of the piece, already documented on other recordings and in countless performances around the world, is complete.  The orchestra has an obvious affection and admiration for him as doe the vociferous audience at concerto's end.

Oramo closes the evening with a richly nuanced performance of the 5th Symphony of Jean Sibelius - a recording that now must stand with the best of the competition.  It is a fitting ending to an evening that celebrates nobility of spirit and the honor of peace.  Grady Harp, August 11",1313107200,3,1422,4.970464135021097
4464433,4,B004SRTKO8,"This was in reality, Oramu's day out. He is not only just a fine conductor, but on any video format, be it blu ray or DVD or youtube, he is a visual treat to watch. Almost poetic in his movements and interpretation, he really comes out as THE star in this show.

Most people are attracted to Joshua Bell's name on this disc. He does not disappoint either, but I beg to differ from many here who have stated it as a benchmark recording of Tchaikovsky. I agree that it is different, very passionate and almost lyrical in places, but this is anything but a Russian work in his approach. Maybe he wishes to take Tchaikovsky out of his stamped Russian character. The effect is good, but not great. I would any day think that the good old poker faced Oistrakh does a much better job of this, not to mention Heifetz or even Vengarov. Interesting indeed, but rather far fetched if one were to deem it as THE Tchaikovsky to devour.

The Beethoven Leonore No. 3 was good, but a bit sterile by standards set by Karajan and the brat-pack of his generation.

Sibelius is the one to really applaud here. I am absolutely certain that it would have been even more spectacular in the concert hall. I have a decent sound system,and the recording appeared to be a little muddy in the louder passages, especially the end of the 1st movement, and the rather brilliant passages of the strings (although you can see the whole string section scratching away furiously) were effectively either drowned by especially the brass and percussion, or appeared a little 'tired' in the recording.

I would definitely recommend this blu ray, but I have a feeling that one may be more enchanted by the clarity of the recording, Oramu's style and the glitter rather than the interpretation of the music itself.",1311984000,9,1774,4.586750788643533
4464434,1,B004SRTKO8,"Joshua Bell is one of my least favorite violinists.  He plays well enough, certainly.  But his ""music making"" is so self-important and superficial that I can not listen to him at all anymore.  His stage presence is no better.  A retired concertmaster I used to know, whose major-league orchestra has accompanied Mr. Bell a dozen or more times in the past 30 years, often called his playing ""pretty but stupid.""  As for this DVD...well, he plays the Tchaikovsky.  A friend lent it to me and insisted I watch it, so I did.  Now in his mid forties, Bell's playing has not deepened with age.  He sounds the same way now as he did when I first heard him in his late teens and early 20s.  Really too bad.  I think he's been so overexposed and commercialized from day one that the world can't help but love him (and I speak also of his People Magazine ""World's 50 Most Beautiful Men"" status in the early 90s.) I wonder if he even practices anymore or tries to go further...if so, I haven't heard it come out of his fiddle.  Oh well, at least his agents are doing what he's paying them to do...but his time has quite clearly passed.  Move over, Joshua, you had your turn in the sunbeam and there are others who need to occupy your place!!

The rest of the concert, Beethoven and Sibelius - both are fine.  Nothing further to add.

Needless to say, if you want to buy a better classical concert DVD, there are so many other better ones on Amazon to choose from.  'Put this one back on the shelf' and keep looking.",1311811200,12,1504,4.356115107913669
