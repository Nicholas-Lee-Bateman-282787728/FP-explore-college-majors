1986664,3,B0001CCXZW,"I'm part of a group of Gilmore Girls faithful. It is, in my opinion, the most well written show on TV, and the chemistry of the cast is irresistable. Don't think twice. Don't wait to see an episode to see if it's worth buying. Just buy it and enjoy! You certainly won't be sorry!",1075248000,2,279,4.185185185185185
1986665,5,B0001CCXZW,This is the ultimate show ! I have seen every episode of GG and I am always amazed at the rapid fire talks beween Rory and Lorelai. These two actresses are so good together. I realize all shows come to an end but thank goodness it is finally on DVD. It has been a long time coming.,1075248000,,281,3.9473684210526314

Luke owns a diner where Lorelai and Rory get their Coffee. Loreai is Rorys Fun outgoing and out there mother. The cocky but gorgeous Trisan DuGrey is a student at Rorys new school and repeatedly gets rejected by her.

1986668,5,B0001CCXZW,"Television shows are tricky. Some of them get better with time, until reaching their climax, and it's downhill from there. The X Files is an example of that. Others begin greatly, but then are never able to reach that peak again. Gilmore Girls is one of those cases. The first season is gold, definitely one of the best seasons of a tv series. There's an intimist atmosphere, the characters are nice, even the two protagonists, and you can relate to them. The balance between drama and comedy, and between common and weird, is flawless. And the fact that Rory is considered the perfect kid is not yet annoying, since she's  cool. Combining that with a great soundtrack and a finale that wraps everything up nicely, and here's all you need about Gilmore Girls.
Unfortunately, it was never this way again. The second season is still very good, despite being irregular, and even if it introduces the love triangle from hell. Jess was an interesting character, even with the clichs, and had good chemistry with Rory. But season 3 started to take this show down the hill, and it still hasn't recovered. Actually, since the creator doesn't seem to acknowledge what's wrong with it, it's hard to believe that it ever will. Having this season at home is a good way to relive its best moments and try to figure out what went wrong.",1074816000,5,1322,4.67381974248927
1986669,5,B0001CCXZW,"No vampires to slay.  No kryptonite ""Freaks of the Week.""  No friggin creeks that you wish the series' namesake to drown in.  Nothing but a well-written, wonderfully cast show that is long overdue for a DVD release.  When the first season DVD release hits shelves, the fourth season should be close to wrapping up on the WB, and hopefully will continue everything about the show that made the first episodes so enjoyable.
Set in a fictional Connecticut town called Stars Hollow, The Gilmore Girls follows the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a a single mother and teenage daughter who share a bond that is as much best friends as it is that of a mother and child.  The series begins with Rory's acceptance into the prestigious Chilton Academy and Lorelai's frantic desire to make that happen, which much to her chagrin, involves the help of her own mother, Emily Gilmore (played by the excellent Kelly Bishop) and father Richard (Edward Herman).  Growing up the rebellious daughter of wealthy society types and becoming pregnant at age 16 didn't exactly endear them to each other.  It is Lorelai's relationship with her parents that drives much of her character's motivation.
While life as a single mother might be hard, Lorelai is not without a support system.  Stars Hollow is populated with an impressive collection of colorful characters, from the gruff, flannel-wearing diner owner, Luke, to Lorelai's coworker and best friend Sookie and the annoying Frenchman, Michel.
Rory, too, has a group of close friends and even closer enemies.  Lane Kim, daughter of a Korean Bible beater is the music obsessed best friend, Dean (Jared Padelecki) is her first boyfriend and Paris, her academic and social rival.  As is the case with basically anything on the WB, Chad Michael Murray also finds his way into her life, as do Madeline and Louise, Paris' oversexed friends and Chilton classmates.
Some of the highlight episodes from this debut season include Concert Interupticus - which featured a Bangles performance and hinted that there might be some degree of feeling beneath Paris' chilly exterior, and Emily in Wonderland - where Emily redecorates Rory's bedroom.  There are 20 more episodes, each with moments or more of genuine wit and even more genuine heart.
All of this considered, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, as Lorelai and Rory, are the show's driving force.  Their chemistry, combined with the clever dialogue and rapid-fire delivery, have made this one of the best shows on tv. And now, at long last, on DVD!",1074816000,123,2523,4.980952380952381
1986670,5,B0001CCXZW,"Oh my gosh! I can't believe they've finally put Gilmore Girls out on DVD! I'm still just kind of in shock.  If you're a big fan of the show, or you just can across it on amazon.com, you've got to buy this, because Gilmore Girls is one of those shows that has comedy, drama, and moral points in it that can relate to normal life in every way. You've got to buy this! It's hilarious!",1074729600,,381,4.08

1986672,5,B0001CCXZW,"I have been watching Gilmore Girls since the very first episode.  Ever since The First episode aired all the way back in 1999 I have been in love with the Characters, Town, and writting of this heartwarming, yet comical tale of a Mother and Daughter (Who are the fastest talkers in the east) Growing up together in a small New England Town (which has residents to rival those of Northern Exposure's Cicely).  At the time of this writting the show is in the middle of it's fourth season and it still hasn't lost its luster (and there is no end in sight).
In the First season we are introduced to Lorelai Gilmore (a 32 year-old mother of one, who runs the Independence Inn, and has a ""stressed"" relationship with her parents), and Rory Gilmore (16 year-old daughter of Lorelai, who is very intelligent for her age).  The Two characters seem more like best-friends then mother/daughter, and they love each other very much.  During the first episode Rory is acepted to Chilton, a private school which will give her a chance to to fulfill her dream (attend Harvard).  But there is a problem, Lorelai cannot afford the tution: Inter Richard and Emily (Lorelai parents, who have a very ugly and colorful history with there daughter).  Richard and Emily agree to pay for Rory's schooling if the girls agree to come to dinner more often (52 times a year, instead of once).
Throughout the first season we are introduced to a hole cast and extremly quirky and lovable characters sucha s: Luke (the owner of the local coffee shop, and Lorelai's best friend), Lane (Rory's best friend, and daughter to the most religious Antique store owner in history), Kirk (a 33 year old man, who has bad social skills and skill lives with his mother), Babett (the next door neighber with a heart of gold, but that isn't necessarly a good thing), Miss Patty (ex-Broadway dancer and local ""know-it-all""), and last but certainly not least Taylor (The local buissy buddy that needs his nose in everybody's buisness).
Throughout the First season the girls will come to grips with many struggles: Rory moving to a new school and realizing that she won't be accepted with open arms, Lorelai coming to grips with her parents which havn't been in her life for many years, A girls first love, a girls frist enemy, and the search for the best cup of coffee.
This First Season DVD includes all 21 season one Episodes which are: Pilot, The Lorelais' First Day at chilton, Kill me NOw, The Deer Hunters, Cinnamon's Wake, Rory's Birthday Parties, Kiss and Tell, Love and WAr and Snow, Rory's Dance, Forgiveness and Stuff, Paris is Burning, Double Date, Concert Interruptus, That Damn Donna Reed, Christopher Returns, Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers, The Breakup - part 2, The Third Lorelai, Emily in Wonderland, P.S. I Lo..., and Love Dasisers and Troubadours.
Included on the DVD are the Following Special Features: Gilmore Girls Beginnings - a documentary including interviews with the show's creators cast and crew, Gilmoreisms - A montage of the Witty comments coined on the show, Gilmore Goodies and Gossip - fun facts popup throughout the episode 'Rory's Dance', additional/deleted scenes, and more.  The Episodes will be in fullscreen, 1.33:1 formate, with English Stereo.  Also included are English, French, and Spanish subtitles.
This is a pretty nice ""first season"" set for a pretty nice show, from the masters of tv-on-dvd (Warner Brothers).",1074729600,7,3419,4.8929188255613125
1986673,5,B0001CCXZW,"I just came to my email box and there was something that i have been waiting for. A alert email from our friends Amazon.com letting me know that the first season of the Gilmore GirlS is coming out on dvd. This is long overdue. And now the wait is over.
And i wanted to be the FIRST to review this more then remarkable television series that is FINALLY getting the due that it more then deserveS.This is a great tv series in the classic sense. Great chemistry between the actresses and actors. And unlike a lot of shows this is more like real life. This show shines in every way possible and then some. The shining star of this show is the young actress Alexis Bledel. Whom i think is one of the most beautiful most aexy actresses we got today And without a doubt one of the most talented. Alexis is about 19 when she started this show so she is part of the club that is playing younger then what she is in real life.(let me also put in a plug for the dvd of a movie that also stars Alexis Bledel ""Tuck Everlasting"":) And the actress that plays Her Mother is also very talented and very beautiful. And they work together magnificatly. A very rare thing in tv today. I been waiting for this and this set is longggg overdue. This show is ""a little show that could"".Started out as this little show and became a loved part of our lives in America. God Bless America and God bless the Gilmore GirlS.And exspect to see lots more of Alexis Bledel. I also want to note that Alexis's eyes speaks silent poetry for her eyes can speak without a sound. A Treasure of this gifted actress. Everyone here is top knoch and more then worth our viewing. Highly recommended. Check out this show and exsperiance the rare Magic that tv needs much more of...Long Live The Gilmore GirlS......",1074729600,2,1768,4.36060606060606

But I have watched about 6 or 8 episodes and find Lorelai's constant quipping so grating, her relationship with her mother annoying and her behavior incredibly immature, not cute.  The relationship with her daughter I'm sure is supposed to be sweet, but it's actually pathetic. She's the original helicopter parent and it's not a pretty sight.  (And btw, is that an XL Sally Fields with a bizarre accent?!?  Why does she talk like that?? )  I really don't get why everyone (including mature adults) is so into this show.  It's saccharine sweet and annoying.  The rest of the negative reviews seem to be about the quality of their DVDs, not the show.  This is supposed to be a review of the SHOW, not the quality of your DVD.

This is one of those TV series that will leave an impression on your life.  It's a very feel good type of TV series that is probably the only show that I have ever wanted to own in every single platform it's available.  Blu-ray, DVD, Digital copy.  I can't get enough of it.

It will make you want to live in a small town.  It will make you want to get outside in this digital world of Facebook, video games, etc. and experience communities and be a part of something.  It has everything, witty banter, humor, love, hate, suspense, joys, everything.  For a TV series to do something at that level, it is truely unique.  I would recommend this TV series to everyone.

Anyways, that's it.  Time to watch it again =)",1424131200,,821,4.287581699346405

1986868,4,B0001CCXZW,"My wife watched this show back when it first came on and enjoyed it. Thinking it a rather uber girly show, I took a pass. Recently, I ran across this set at a very cheap price and bought it for her. And much to my surprise, I find myself enjoying it as much as my wife. Now I've always liked the classic rom-coms (When Harrry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, Moonstruck), but have never been into chick flicks in general. But the Gilmore Girls takes that style very high indeed. It's not only chick flick and rom-com, but screwball comedy and sweetly gentle social satire. You've got your adorable single mom and teenaged daughter...you've got your wisecracking (but not too biting) banter and wit that goes on for miles...you've got your picturesque New England town (shot in LA of course)...you've got your eccentric lovable friends and relations up the ying-yang...you've got your weekly hilarious tempests in teapots...you've got your romances blooming and fading... Gilmore Girls is just great, funny, feel-good TV...even for guys who don't think this show is for them. There is one caveat, though; that has nothing to do with the entertainment value of the show. The transfer from film to DVD here is disappointing. Instead of being sharp and crisp--as such crisp, sharp material deserves--the imagery is dull and out-of-focus, and sometimes dark and murky. Gilmore Girls deserved better technical quality than the DVD company provided. A remastering from the original film elements for DVD & Blu Ray is urgently needed.",1418428800,,1526,5.011811023622047

1986892,1,B0001CCXZW,"Wife ordered this one.  This is the worst show ever created, but for some reason, females love it.

I have pinned it down to a sole reason.  Bad acting aside, it is the temp of the script.  They answer or respond to questions almost before the other character has ended speaking.  I mean, if the people in Stars Hollow are telepathic, then I think they should state that somewhere in the 153 episodes.

Alas, I do not think they are telepathic, but just bad acting, bad script writing, and an all around headache of a show.",1417392000,4,523,4.395833333333333

1986899,3,B0001CCXZW,"I just started watching Gilmore Girls on cable TV. There's something about it that makes you want to return and watch more.  But the more I watched, the less I liked it.

The rapid-fire dialogue irks me.  Lorelai is just too much of a friend to her daughter, Rory and seems to have a hard time being serious; everything has to have a zinger of  a line or comeback.  Lorelai's character overcompensates for her mother's coldness and stiffness.  Rory's character irritates me because of how much of a people-pleaser she is (I think she just reminds me too much of myself as a kid).

It's ok, it's definitely a sweet program and it's funny, but I think I made a mistake in binge-watching it.  The things that made the characters so endearing quickly became tiresome.",1415145600,3,763,4.6

The dialogue and chemistry between Lorelei and Rory is great. You really get the feeling they are mother and daughter. I also really enjoy their interactions with Emily and Richard. You can really feel the emotional turmoil between Lore and Emily. Now add into the mix the supporting characters from the small town they live in and it is an AMZING show. I love Luke, Sookie, Patty, Kurt, and even Taylor at times. I also love that this is a family show your entire family can enjoy.

1986907,5,B0001CCXZW,"This show has some of the best writing you'll hear...ever.  It was a shame for this show to go off the air after just 7 seasons.  If you like rapid-fire, smart dialogue loaded with pop culture references and delightfully quirky characters, this show is a must.  Lauren Graham (Parenthood) and Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly, Bridesmaids, etc, etc) may be better known for their more recent work, but Gilmore Girls will always be my favorite roles for both. Alexis Bledel is lovely as daughter Rory Gilmore and veteran screen actors Edward Herrmann and Carol Bishop are outstanding as the Gilmore grandparents.  Recurring characters played by Sally Struthers and Liz Torres, among others, are frosting on the cake.  I own all seven seasons on DVD but purchased these two episodes when I needed a Gilmore Girls fix on my Kindle.  This series is worth the investment!",1411084800,2,864,4.924137931034482

I've only seen part of the first season but it's such a strong first season.  I love that the actors all seem to look like normal people of all shapes, sizes, and looks (although yes it is a bit on the white side).  And there are a surprising number of women in the show considering when this came out.

And I am LOVING the character development.  The characters all start out seeming like they're going to be one note characters and then slowly they open up and it's just great.  I also love the supporting characters and there are so many.  The town of Stars Hollow is full of great people/characters.

Not only was it another way for us to bond, but it covered so many of the challenges that teenagers go through, from friends, to boyfriends, to preparing for and choosing a college. By the time my daughter was applying to colleges, we knew what to expect (and we were looking for that large envelope in the mail, which we got, and unfortunately which they no longer do...it's all my email now). It's a great, wholesome series that I highly recommend every mom watch with her daughters. It offers plenty of opportunities for discussion of situations they may encounter in their own lives.  My daughter even puts it on when she comes home for college breaks because it's very comforting to watch.",1393718400,,794,4.631205673758865

1986997,5,B0001CCXZW,"So, I love streaming downloads from my Cloud, which doesn't have to be dusted and the kids can't scratch and ruin.
I love the Gilmore Girls, ever since I stumbled upon it completely by accident while sitting in an emergency room waiting room.
If you don't know the Gilmore Girls already you should start at the beginning... When you meet Loralei's mother you will meet my grandmother at the same time... not the actress, but the character they wrote. That is probably one reason that this show has so much appeal for me, I didn't know enough people who had grandmothers like that, so didn't know there were a lot of people who could understand....!
When you come right down to it, Loralei the mom is rather selfish and intolerant, just like HER mom, but she does it differently so its hard to recognize as being the same at first. Rori, the daughter, is also being taught a lot of that, but having her eye on education and career makes her a little less in-your-face control freak. And, of course, all the women have stunning moments of goodness, which sort of helps you love them in spite of....
I hope you enjoy the series as much as I do. And, I just won't understand anyone who doesn't love that streaming cloud thing!",1367798400,,1222,4.509009009009009

1987001,5,B0001CCXZW,"For anyone who likes witty comments, quirky personalisties, communities, family or even romance than this series is perfect.
If focuses on the daily lives of mother/daughter team: Lorelai and Rory Gilmore.  This series starts off with Rory at 16 and her mother, who had Rory and left home when she was 16.  for all these years they have relied on each other but when Rory gets an offer to prestigious school, financial hardships follow and  Lorelai turns to her parents for assistance.  This first season focuses on the precarious relationship they two have with the Lorelai's parents.  In addition, thoughout the series we get to meet the fascinating people of Stars Hollow (where they live).  Exuberant Sookie, the ornery yet caring Luke, the noisy neighbors, stunted Kirk and many more loveable characters.  As all drama's must we also get to join the Gilmore's in some of their relationships as well.
Do not think that this series is only for females!  I know guys who would watch episodes with me and would get a kick from the wittism shown and the fast paced dialogue with pop- culture references makes this fun for everyone.  So while its perfect to sit and watch with you mom, grandmother, daughter, etc; feel free to watch it with your boyfriend, husband, neighbor, etc.  The lighthearted comedic side is a perfect blend to its drama/family counterpart.
The packaging is also nice her.  each disc gets its own side to click into a plastic holder, so no more discs stacking one ontop another.  This really seems to help with avoiding scratches.  So sit back with your favorite snacks ( I guarantee you'll see the Gilmore Girls do the same throughout the show), grab a friend or family member and enjoy the show.",1360713600,,1719,4.8061224489795915

1987018,5,B0001CCXZW,"My wife adores the series and I like it, too. She'd seen this back in college and talked about it for some time, so I took a chance ... and it payed off! One of her utmost favorites! The thing that really makes the series is the measure of just how much the viewer wishes they were part of Stars Hollow. I'm one of those who - in the first few seasons, anyway - wished such. Now, although I feel it never surpasses the energy and vibe of season one, the series holds up well nearly throughout its whole seven year run. With it being a dramedy, the balance is really best in its introduction. After this, the drama picks up some and, slowly, Stars Hollow becomes less and less charming and sweet over time. However, the next three years are still pretty strong (especially season three) - and if only season six could have held onto the brilliance it created during its first half. Whether you become a big fan or not, though, I feel anyone couldn't help loving season one. In this season, Rory starts dating and begins attending the very competitive Chilton, as her mother has boy problems of her own. Rory's time at Chilton, her grandparents, and Luke who runs the diner add some good drama, but ""Rory's Birthday Parties"" proves just how much fun Stars Hollow can be.",1358208000,3,1268,4.446351931330472

1987043,5,B0001CCXZW,"While flipping through channels a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon Gilmore Girls. I recall when the series was first aired in 2000 and for some reason I never got around to watching an episode. What caught my eye was that Lauren Graham was constantly carrying around a cup of coffee, which so do I. After twenty minutes of viewing and listening to the snappy dialogue, I was now a fan. A few days later I went to a Target store in the city and found seasons one and two bundled together for twenty dollars.

Gilmore Girls is set in the small, wacky town of Stars Hollows, where single mother Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham), manager of the Independence Inn, is raising her sixteen-year-old daughter Rory (played Alexis Bledel). When her daughter is accepted into the Chilton Preparatory School, Lorelai asks her rich estranged parents for financial help due to the school's expensive tuition. Of course things are not so simple as her parents want them to have Friday night dinners with them and be an active involvement in their lives.

Besides from Lorelai and Rory's addiction to coffee, I like their quirky personalities. Lorelai is a fun and carefree mother, while Rory is a Harvard bound book nerd. The dialogue between the two is smart, snappy, and more real than other scripted shows. There are other colorful characters on the show as well, such as Luke Danes who owns the local diner; Lane Kim, Rory's best friend (When the series started the actress was 27 playing a 16 year-old.); and Sookie St. James, Lorelai's best friend and head chef at the Independence Inn (played by Melissa McCarthy).

In just over a week, I watched the entire first season, but I did skip over a few that I had already seen. Even though the show is almost twelve years old, I find it to be a bit of fresh air compared to other horribly scripted shows on network television today.",1337731200,2,1867,4.651515151515151

The witty bantering between her and Rory (if that is how you spell her name) is refreshing TV. BUT in between these high points you get a true glimpse of spoiled, self-involved, bratty Americans. Their wise cracks turn into cynicism after they make fun of anything nice and good. The entire ""I was abused because I was born into a wealthy privileged family with parents who wanted something for me"" bit got old and actually never got off the ground. It was more like ""I was abused by my bad decisions born out of total selfish behavior"" bit. I would have loved to have had had a foot in the door of LauraLai's parents' world. . . . her parents as a great aunt and uncle or something. The show pulls you in to the love stories only to let you down as the ""heroines"" turn on their lovers and of course blame their wealthy backgrounds. They toss aside good guys who treat them well just because. They rattle off these lines of just words as fast as they can, usually yelling, gets old and annoying after a while. It is supposed to be intelligent banter somehow, we are led to believe. It was really a disappointment to watch these train wrecks in motion. But I must say . . . it is reality for some people. How many times have you known someone who just dug their own grave out of total immaturity and you just had to sit around watching them to because they refused to listen to any advice. They had everything and just thumbed their nose at it claiming to have the high moral ground. I just think I wouldn't like most of these people in real life as the ones similar to them I know in real life . . . I distance myself from. Funny irony is no matter how much LaurLai makes fun of her parents and her upbringing and no matter how many teary emotional outburts we witness between her and her parents over how ""abused"" she was she runs right back to them for help when the going gets rough.

Little did I know that I would get sucked in right along with her. The characters are quirky and downright odd, making it one snappy, fun, sensational show.

Here's a list of my favorite supporting characters. Sookie, the chef whose pastries and palatable perfection literally had my mouth watering, even as she went off on some tangent about Lorelai's whatever. There's the reception desk manager, Michel who is strangely bitter, yet so... not, that I could hardly take my eyes off of him. And that accent, ... oooo, la, la. Of course, the show would not be complete without Emily and Richard Gilmore, Lorelai's parents who are so perfect that they are full of flaws. Then there's Paris, one of my favorite characters of all time. She's a total psycho, but somehow, we all love her for the insanity and root her on as she claws her way to the top of the Harvard food chain. And then, da da da dum, we have Luke, the love object for Lorelai's affection and the father figure in Rory's eye.

Of course, the main characters, Lorelai and Rory, are awesome. I particularly enjoyed watching the interaction between Lorelai and her parents. Rory acts like the padding in this relationship and rather than detract from the characters, this interaction works to propel the writing forward. There are no special effects, no cars exploding, no supernatural phenomenon, unless you count Lorelai's sensational appetite for all things quirky. Instead, there is quality acting, writing, and production, creating one superb show.

That said, I didn't like season seven. I felt that I had invested all this time, effort and emotion into the show only to be let down and left hanging in season seven. There are just too many strange things that happen in season seven. It just about ruined the show for me. But that's another review.",1285286400,,1959,4.789940828402367

What was most fun about the few episodes of Gilmore Girls that I did see when they originally aired was the very UNreality of this idealized story.

A real-life Lorelai would likely have been much more worn down by the stresses of single parenthood, the real Grandparents would likely have already died by the time their money paid for Rory's schooling, and a real Rory and Tristan would likely have been too reserved, too shy and ""appropriate"" ever to have dared reveal to anyone, let alone to one another, that each one carried a torch for the other.  Thus, real-life characters even partially similar to our favorites in Gilmore Girls would likely have had lives whose tone far more closely matched that of an O Henry or Anton Checkov short story than this bubbly, cheerful TV series.  Nevertheless, at times it is the very fantasy of a happy ending that we reach for, as I will be reaching to watch these unlikely but heartening and essentially hopeful vignettes in the weeks ahead.",1264550400,,1215,4.712264150943396

1987120,5,B0001CCXZW,"This is such a unique and fun show. I've owned this set for a few years now and I never get sick of it. There's always something new and fun to bring to the table. Yes, ultimately at the core of it all, its main idea is the relationships between characters, especially the Mom and Daughter relationship(s). (Lorelai + Rory, Emily + Lorelai, even Emily + Rory) However I feel it does a great job of showing character development without it getting too stale or boring.

I really love that this show is so funny. It does a great job of making me actually laugh out loud and if you're anything like me, will try to challenge themselves to figure out where most of their little comedic ""references"" come from.

Overall I adore the first season of Gilmore Girls. The writers do a great job of making Stars Hollow become a believable, little, small town community, even including the quirky personalities to be found in said towns. They keep you interested in it from the moment the pilot begins until the moment the final episode of the series ends.

About the only complaint I have is the super-fast talking each character has to be able to speak at just so the writers can get everything in that they wanted to. Thought after a while its not hard to pick up on and you will barely notice it anymore. I guess it could actually add to part of the shows charm if you want to look at it that way.

I enjoyed the special features on this dvd a lot. I feel it gives good insight into the story and characters. I especially loved finding out something interesting about the character of Luke. (Which I could tell you but won't because Im not going to ruin it for anyone.) And it gives good insights into how they were able to get the cast that they ultimately ended up with.

Anyway, this is a very good show to watch. It's a great way to get one's mother/daughter to sit down for an hour and do something together. Actually, my entire family enjoys this show, not just the women. I guess there is enough humor in it to make it passable for guys to watch too.",1246406400,,2049,4.339425587467363

1987135,3,B0001CCXZW,"Ok...so I think this show is absolutely adorable. I love the dialog and the story lines are very entertaining. However, I am extremely disturbed by the character Lane. I understand that it must be difficult being raised by strict Korean immigrants, in a lily white/All American type of enviornment. But Jesus, does every episode have to involve her saying something disparaging about her culture. I find myself cringing everytime she makes a ""Korean joke."" It would be nice to see a more balanced Asian-American character who had pride in her culture, and wasn't so easy to fully immerse herself into White American cultural values.",1237161600,2,632,5.086538461538462

1987170,5,B0001CCXZW,"My husband converted me to Gilmore Girls fandom through reruns on ABC Family channel. We rented the complete first season so that I might enjoy the series from the beginning.

The first season lays the groundwork for the future complexities and issues in the series. From the first episode, we learn about Lorelai's stormy relationship with her parents; Rory's ambitions; Sookie's gourmet tastes (which ultimately lead her to love and babies); the Gilmores disappointments, etc. The major characters are not perfect. Lorelai is still ""stuck"" at 16- the age she was when she gave birth to Rory. Rory's best friend is her immature mother. (In fact, I've become upset with Rory for occassionally closing out Lane Kim, who is her other best friend.) Lorelai and Rory are selfish, confused, and emotionally unavailable to their friends. Still, it's addictive to watch their trials and tribulations in their quiet New England town.

Lane, Sookie, and Michael are wonderful supporting characters who are much healthier than our heroines. Lane is the best friend every teenager wishes she would have. Lane's mom is the kind of parents most mothers wish their daughters' best friends would have! Sookie is has so much gusto and she's not afraid to ask men out. Michael has to deal with Lorelai's juvenile nonsense, and he takes it all with good humor and sassy replies! :)

The show attempts to deal with issues of socioeconomic status. That's where it fails, in retrospect. The canned stereotypes leave much to be desired. Not only do the superwealthy (Gilmores) become embarrassed when their 16 year old daughter gets pregnant; not only do the superwealthy become disappointed when their teen daughter ruins her college plans; not only do the superwealthy wreck their cars in drunken stupors; not only do the superwealthy get all persnickety about their homes and appearances. Rory's decision to attend Chilton demonstrates that she buys into class and labels. Rory is more Grandma Gilmore than Lorelai is. Yet, Lorelai, who walked away from a comfortable lifestyle to raise Rory on her own, working as a maid and living in a one room ""shack"" condones Rory's decision.

Nevertheless, the stories are wonderful. I can't wait to rent season two!",1228780800,,2236,5.084468664850136

I enjoyed this season because I had missed this entire season when it first aired on the WB; so I loved watching how Stars Hollow came to life.  Then there is Max, wow he is an amazing guy.  Now I know what the Friday night dinners are all about.  The blind date was hilarious.  There's Gran, wow what a character. Then Dean, yep the Dean, he is such a wonderful boyfriend to Rory (he is every mother's dream boyfriend for their daughter).",1216684800,,608,4.153846153846154
1987174,5,B0001CCXZW,"Whatever happened to Gilmore Girls in later seasons? I don't know. But whatever did was NOT a problem in Season 1. If you're thinking of giving the show a chance because you've heard so much about it, go ahead! Jump, take the dive, it's perfectly safe.

Season 1 is the story of the Gilmore family, Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter, and all the people they include daily in their lives. Wether by blood or by experience, the Gilmore family is a big and fun one.

Season 1 deals with how Lorelai and Rory got to that point in their lives. It deals with Rory growing up, having her first boyfriend; with Lorelai slowly coming to terms with her parents and her expectations for her daughter and their world.

The Gilmore girls are not perfect, but they're charming and quite interesting. One of the highlights of the season is Rory's developing relationship with Dean Forester. I think Dean is usually underrated, but to me, he was Rory's best boyfriend and in this season, while they're still so young, they're still a romantic and warm couple.

There are little DVD extras and the ones included are not exactly riveting or revealing. I would have loved a few commentaries and a gag reel, but you buy this set for the episodes, because they're wonderful.

1987195,3,B0001CCXZW,"Been generally enjoying watching this on DVD; after a while the fast, smartie-pants repartee gets old, but it's still interesting to see how this buddy-buddy theory of raising a kid will work out. The mom isn't a great example to her kid, with her sleeping around, but this is TV. In one episode, however, the liberal bent lurking in the background comes to the fore in a nasty way - for no reason, the mom screams that she hates George Bush. And why? Because of the way he looks! Classic liberal hypocrisy - attacking someone because he looks weird to you, or because he doesn't agree with your views, yet denouncing ""lookism"". (And you just KNOW she has a bumper sticker that says ""Hatred is not a family value."") This peeled back the cheery veneer of the show for me, although you knew it already from the joy-hating Korean Christian mom character.

1987217,5,B0001CCXZW,"This is my all-time favorite TV show! Every episode makes for riveting viewing, and the great casting makes all the difference...the drama centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. Its an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estanged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible...Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the chram in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.

The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman,Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their role in the series.

1987249,5,B0001CCXZW,"Oh, Gilmore! *sigh* You were so young!

Let's start this off with a statement: I am a GIGANTIC Gilmore fan. GIGANTIC! I've watched this show since I was 15 years old, so I feel as if I've grown up with it and its characters.

This is the very first season. Rory is an innocent, inexperienced little one (yes, I'm getting sentimental even though Rory is a year or two older than I am). Lorelai is still working at the Independence Inn and, of course, looking for a man (which she does basically throughout the series. Luke forever! Okay. I'll stop, ha), dealing with her parents, and caring for the love of her life: Her daughter, Rory, whom she had at the age of 16, which created a myriad of problems between her and her parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore.

The first season of the show revolves around Rory and Lorelai's relationship, their loves lives, and their outside school/working lives. Rory enrolls into Chilton, an esteemed prep school, and she meets a group of girls including the sarcastic Paris Gellar. Lorelai is working at her Inn with her best friend, Chef Sookie, and rude but funny as hell Michel. The show is also infused with the goings on of Stars Hollow (where Lorelai and Rory live), which happens to be a town I would die to live in with people I would die to call my friends. The townies are hilarious. Luke, who owns the local diner, is just beyond words awesome. And if you don't end up wanting Luke and Lorelai together by the first season...you are basically not good. Haha. Just playing. The show also has the Gilmore (aka: the rich world Lorelai left at 16) world alongside the Stars Hollow world. It is filled with Friday Night Dinners, fancy parties hosted by Emily, and enough guilt and resentment to make anyone become a coffee addict like Lorelai Gilmore.

The writing is so great thanks to Amy Sherman-Palladino, Daniel Palladino, and other writers. The show has such heart, charm, and wit. The characters are the best I've ever seen on any television show. The performances are all great - especially Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) and Kelly Bishop's (Emily Gilmore). Scott Patterson (Luke Danes) is also great throughout the series, but never receives the credit he should. But do remember, I'm a GIGANTIC fan, so I could be bias.

Basically...watch the damn show. If you don't like it, something is wrong with you. Just joking.",1180051200,2,2369,4.698795180722891
1987250,5,B0001CCXZW,"For any fan and collector of the show, this is a must. I'll have to admit I had already bought the first five seasons before I bought the first and while the later episodes are great the first season sets the tone for the rest of the shows later. Who is going to forget Rory's first kiss, Richards first bout with angina and Loreli and Lukes chemestry, all all set up in the first season? In the pilot, however, it seems that Rory comes off a little darker than she does for the rest of the series and the extras on the last disk seems to have been added several seasons later, as in after the show has become a success.",1178928000,,620,4.132231404958677

1987263,5,B0001CCXZW,"Gilmore Girls is ending this year.  Season 7 shall be the end of one of the most creative, witty, intelligent and well acted series on television.

Season 1 begins it all and this show is very rare for most shows are a little rusty during their first season.  Not Gilmore Girls.  You watch the pilot and it's as if these people have always been around.  And by mid season its as if the show has been around for years.

The acting from the entire stellar cast is exemplary but none of it could exist without Lorelai - the truly believable characterization brought to life by the gifted Lauren Graham.  She carries this show on her shoulders entirely.  Yes, she and Alexis Blesdel as the amazing Rory have unique and true chemistry.

But it is Lauren's acting chops that everyone els must match.  Her scenes with her mother - Kelly Bishop and Luke - Scott Patterson are all Emmy worthy.  And who can't love the sweet and wacky Sookie.

I have always found it sad that this show was on the WB (now the CW) for shows on this network never got their due.  Had this show been on a major network it would have garnered Emmy nods and wins every year - especially Lauren Graham.

But get season 1 and all the rest.  Gilmore Girls may be leaving prime time but it will never leave my life.  I have just started watching the dvd's from season 1 for the third time.  It always sparkles and never looses its glow.",1178496000,5,1400,4.343629343629344

I had to send it to her as she doesn't have a tv at home and I don't know if there's Gilmore Girls series on the tv there. I watch here in Italy but unfortunately they don't show chronologically but sporadically in 3 segments from different seasons (1, 2 and sometimes 3, I guess). Love it very much as it reminds so much of my relation with my daughter.

I'm addicted to it.  I love every show.  But I had to start with season 1 for my daughter where I already reached season 2 here in Italy.

Very sweet storyline.  Love Lauralai and Rory.  But I wish Lauralai would not be so antagonistic towards her mother and her mother would not be so detached and cold to her in return.  That's the only dissappointment I have in this tv series.

Will save money to buy the whole series up to season 6 if possible.

1987267,5,B0001CCXZW,"Having literally grown up together, 16-year-old Rory Gilmore and her 32-year-old mother Lorelai are best friends. They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.

In Season 1, Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.

Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.

Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others.

Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter. Still, I can overlook that -- it's fun having one of my favorite shows set in my own state. That way, I almost feel like I might really bump into a Stars Hollow resident somewhere along my way... :-)",1174521600,2,1912,5.099041533546326

I love seeing the old EP and the Pilot which is in this collection. Three or so EP's into the season you meet Chris, Rory's father. You also meet his parents and you are soon glad they have nothing to do with Rory. I feel for her a little knowing how it feels having family that don't have anything to do with you for someone elses misstake. Emily says it best when she cheers her granddaughter up with the misstake caused problems, but she is loved. Mother and Daughter are a roit as they bounce off eachother.

After the first few episodes of Gilmore girls I found myself hooked, despise my frustration at times with the adult Lorelai (who I feel acts immature a lot). The premise is a cute one and there are plenty of fun times had by all, especially the introduction of Rory's boyfriend Dean, and Lorelai's romantic life.

Despite the fact that I like this show, I am a bit tired of some elements. Lorelai and her daughter have awful eating habits. They seem to survive off of pizza, burgers, and poptarts and don't gain a pound. Seldom (except when they go to their grandparents do these two ladies eat a normal meal). Second, I do get a bit tired of the adult Lorelai's spastic jokes. The humor seems forced and dumb rather than witty and humorous as the writer's intended. Also, sometimes the small town atmosphere is TOO quirky, and too strange. A little goes a long way.

I do like Rory's friend Ling, the character of Rory, her boyfriend Dean, and her friends Tristan and Paris. I like Luke occasionally and Suki in small doses.

They agree to pay for Chilton but Lorelei and Rory must attend Friday night dinners in exchange for the money. Lorelei has a very strain relationship with her parents and you can actually see each charactor's point of view and understand where their coming from.  The entire cast is really amazing from Sookie, Luke and Michel to Paris, Richard and Emily. The town of Stars Hollow is a corky small town. Rory's smart, bookish and loves school which was a real change from most teenagers on TV. She has a goal to go to Harvard and her mother's determind to make that happen. Rory gets her first boyfriend in Dean while Lorelei dates one of Rory's teacher Max despite her attraction to diner owner Luke Danes. The writting is incredable from the hilarious jokes to the hundreds of references to movies, music and other stuff.

1987309,5,B0001CCXZW,"""Gilmore Girls"" could have easily been a bad show. A story about a mother and a daughter bravely going through life could have been pathetic, boring and uninteresting. But then the makers took an unexpected U-Turn - they made it a smart one.

The most valuable part of this mother-daughter story is the dialogue. When Lorelai and Rory get in their zone, the audience is thrown inside a chaos of pop culture references, witty word-choices and genuine emotion. Most importantly, the audience is invited to be a part of Stars Hollow, the little city where the two Lorelais live with a bunch of other memorable characters. In order to understand the show, you need to actively participate in the discussions and issues of the show. What is usually something you watch while ironing the clothes, you are absorbed into the world of Gilmore Girls.

This show is successful because of its cast. There is some fine acting involved, and although the cast is basically unknown, they make you care and follow their struggles without blinking. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are adorable and manage to cover all the minor mistakes that are made. After you see the whole first season of this wonderful show, you will be left with a sufficient amount of special features to become a Stars Hollow native yourself. The makers of ""Gilmore Girls"" did not take their audience for granted, and it has been proven before that a smart show is a good show. Why would the story of Lorelai and Rory be an exception?",1162598400,,1490,4.749034749034749

1987312,4,B0001CCXZW,"I wouldn't exactly call myself a fan of the Gilmore Girls, I wouldn't have thought I was the kind of guy who'd be drawn to this kind of show. Still, my girlfriend got the first series on DVD and we'd been watching it in mini-mararathons now and then, and it's a pretty decent show.

The series is all about Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a mother and daughter who live in a small, sleepy American town, where everyone knows everyone, as well as everyone's business. Rory was the result of a fling Lorelai had with a boy when she was 16, a fling that has alienated her from her well-to-do parents, who live half an hour away. Rory thinks they're nice enough, but Lorelai tries to keep out of their way. This year, however, she won't be able to do that. You see, this year, young Rory is off to a very exclusive school, to make the most of her academic talents. This all costs money, and Lorelai is forced to ask her distanced parents for a loan. Her parents agree, on the condition that Lorelai and Rory come to see them once a week for dinner. Being the first series, there are many others firsts. First kisses, first loves, etc. I'm sure all these firsts will leave others out there wanting seconds!

It's strange, but it doesn't feel like a TV series, I don't think. Like I've mentioned, I watched these episodes in bursts, and it all flowed like a really long movie (in a good way). Characters interacted, grew and developed, the people's feelings turned into ideas, and those ideas into actions across the episodes. It was quite interesting, very, very well planned and put together. The characters aren't perfect (I find Lorelai to be a bit of a control freak, for instance), but I think the writers know that, and these faults are explored nicely.

There's quite a lot of cultural references in the show. Rory being as intellegent as she is, she reads a lot of classic literature, and her friend Lane Kim seems to have an encyclopedia-like knowledge of popular music. It was nice to hear these references, and I knew what most of them were, but at the age these teens are supposed to be, I found a little unbelievable. It was a bit of a stretch that they knew so much, but ah well.

When I first saw an ad for Gilmore Girls one day when I was watching tv, I thought to myself, ""Oh great. Another feel good show. I'm not going to waste my time with that."" I am so glad that I eventually changed my mind and started to watch it. I think that I started watching it when there were reruns on ABC Family since I started on the 1st season. I immediately became hooked. It's amazing how the actors and actresses can talk as fast as they do. Most of the references made go right by me. That's why the Gilmorisms guide that comes with almost all of the DVDs except season 5 comes in handy. I feel that it's better to review the 1st season of Gilmore Girls to start out with at least since that is where it all began.

This show has strong writing, quick wit and humor.  The actors and actresses pull it off flawlessly.  Each season builds on the work of previous seasons and introduces new characters.

One of the beautiful things about Gilmore Girls is the character devlopment.  It starts of with Lorelai and Rory Gilmore but builds beyond them into developing pretty much the whole town of Stars Hollow.  Many of the quirky characters bring humor and a touch of seriousness to the show.

All the characters are wonderfully real and original, and they all manage to somehow be funny, without being laughable.

1987335,5,B0001CCXZW,"The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.

When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.

It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.

The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",1141430400,,1946,4.807807807807808

1987348,5,B0001CCXZW,"Nothing anyone can say or write could capture the wonder and perfection of Gilmore Girls on television. It's the smartest show I've ever seen with all kinds of funny references flying out of everyone's mouth every 10 seconds. The communication between characters is so amazing you'll be addicted to Gilmore Girls by the time in the first episode when you see Lorelai begging for a cup of coffee from Luke at his diner. The first thing we learn about the Gilmore Girls is that Lorelai can not function with out coffee. What show would take a risk to talk about coffee in the first few minutes? Gilmore Girls would. When you're watching the show one can only marvel at how fast they are talking. It must be really hard to talk that fast but, it is so amazing. It makes the show what it is. No one can imagine Gilmore Girls with out the fast paced talking in the dialoge.

So, the First Season of Gilmore Girls is where it all starts. Lorelai is running the Independance Inn with Head Chef Sookie by her side, and rude French Michel answering the phone (hopefully). But, Lorelai and Sookie's dream is to someday open a Inn of their own (Hence Season 4). Rory is very smart and has big plans for her future. She wants to go to Harvard and become a journalist. So, she and Lorelai who wants the same for her, are estatic when a letter of acceptance comes from Chilton for Rory. They see Chilton as one step closer for Rory to achieve her dream. The only problem standing in the way of achieving that dream is money. Something Lorelai doesn't have that much of to give to the school for Rory's tuition. So, she comes to the painful last resort of asking her parents who she doesn't have very much of a relationship with for money. They agree but, with the Gilmore's there are always strings attatched. The Gilmore Girls have to start coming over for Friday night dinners. Suddenly Rory's Grandparents are a part of their lives something that Lorelai is not very happy about. But, allows it anyway so they will pay for Rory's school. This season is also where Lorelai meets Max (One of Rory's Chilton teachers)! Also, Rory gets her first ever boyfriend, Dean in Season One. A boyfriend that Lorelai actually likes. As Lorelai puts it, ""The best first boyfriend you could ever have."" (Personally, although other people might have other opinions I don't like Dean that much mainly because of what he did in Season 4.) In this season we also, get introduced to Christopher, Rory's father. I think the writers tried to leave a feeling with Christopher that maybe someday he and Lorelai could have a future. But, anybody who is a true Gilmore fan knows that Luke and Lorelai are meant to be together. I will be so mad if in the end they are not together and instead it's Christopher!!

Pilot: Rory is accepted to the elite Chilton prep school. Bad news for Lorelai: she must make amends with her parents to borrow the money for Rory's tuition. The money is available - with strings attatched.

The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton: YOu get extra pints if you sing the school song - in Latin. Chilton isn't a place where cutoffs and cowboy boots are the fashion. But, that's what Lorelai hurriedly throws on to accompany Rory to the posh school.

Overall a MUST HAVE for anybody! A Gilmore fan or someone who hasn't even heard of Gilmore Girls but, just stumbled randomly upon my review MUST get Gilmore Girls Season 1. Money well spent.",1137888000,8,8758,4.7694848084544255

1987350,5,B0001CCXZW,"Omg I was a fan since the first episode.  All you need to know about this series, pretty much sums it up in the first episode.  It has to be the best pilot I have ever seen.  I know that Emily and Richard are snotty, but I do not think that there would be any Gilmore Girls without Friday night dinners.

The show wouldn't be the same with different actors, its perfect!

I just have one question about it, I mean I know who Kirk is, but in the 2nd episode (The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton), when Lorelai comes home to find him installing a DSL, well he says his name is Mick, so that can be confusing to some people.

Dean has to be the most perfect boyfriend ever, I want my boyfriend to be like that, it wouldn't hurt to look like that either.  Also, I know that Triston likes Rory and she has no clue, but they could've went further on that, I think it would have been great if they would have done more than kiss, I mean like date or something, not sex!

I am officially addicted to this show, and I cant wait until the 6th season comes off TV and on to DVD, I hate waiting a whole week to watch it.  I mean now that I have the DVDs seasons 1-5 I need to watch it everyday, can't go through a day without a Gilmore moment lol.

Anyways, in the 1st season, Lorelai borrows money from her snotty parents and has to now come to dinner every Friday night. She meets Max, it doesn't work.  You can tell Luke and Lorelai like eachother! Rory gets her 1st boyfriend Dean, who is perfect. Rory gets accepted to Chilton, a prep school, one step closer to Harvard. Max and Lorelai get back together, with a unanswered purposal and 1000 yellow daises at the end.  All in all, its a awesome show, no one will be disappointed!

I had my friend watch it with me, she was hesitant and now she is just as addicted to it!

1987354,5,B0001CCXZW,"Some shows take a while to hit their stride, but this one was brilliant from Episode One, capturing smart, funny, poignant, off-beat, and warm all in one gulp.

It's not a 'chick-flick', as the ""Girls"" in the title might indicate, although the central relationship does involve around a young thirtysomething mother, Lorelai, and her teenage daughter, Rory.

Richard and Emily (Lorelai's parents) are pleasing antagonists. The eclectic townies offer entertaining second and third storylines. And then there's Luke, Mr. Backwards Baseball Hat Diner Owner, whom we just KNOW pines for Lorelai and loves Rory as if she were his own daughter.

In this first season, Rory has her first boyfriend and her heartbreaking first breakup. And even though ""Love, Daisies and Troubadours"" leaves us with a marriage proposal to Lorelai from a perfectly respectable and charming man in the last episode, with a thousand yellow daisies, just as she's always dreamed, we know that someday, some way, she'll end up as Mrs. Backwards Baseball Hat.

If you are already a fan, you'll be a bigger fan after a second and third viewing. If you're not yet a fan, this is a great place to start.",1134000000,3,1169,4.97948717948718

Perhaps it's because I am around the age of the charactor Lorelai, or because I can relate to being a single mom, or because the story is written so well...nahhhh, I just love their humor, and the stirring passion between her and Luke. You simply MUST check this out!",1133827200,,451,4.317647058823529
1987376,4,B0001CCXZW,"Gilmore Girls is a great show exploring the relationship between a 32-year old mom and her 16-year-old daughter.  I think it is great that more and more shows are exploring the positive aspects of different kinds of relationships.  Everwood is a show about a father (trying to be one) and his angry, resentful son. Gilmore Girls explores the single mom dynamic and does it very, very well.

Most of the credit, although the cast is very good from top to bottom, has to go to Lauren Graham.  She's without question one of the best actresses on television today.  She is fast, witty, and has a charismatic personality that draws you in.  Scott Cohen (Max Medina) states in the interviews, ""If you're going to act across from Lauren Graham, you'd better bring your 'A' game, because she'll leave you in the dust otherwise.""  She plays a cheerful, exciting mom who drinks coffee by the bucketful, loves to eat pizza and chocolate, and runs a small Inn in the town of Star's Hollow.  I'm not a girl, but I can quickly imagine that Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is the kind of mom that many girls envision for themselves.  She's more than a mom to her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), she's her best friend.  Don't think that Lorelai is soft on her daughter when Rory finds herself in a pickle or has done something wrong, as Lorelai can quickly shift to a very concerned and disappointed mother.

Cast includes Scott Patterson (Luke) who runs a small diner.  He doesn't talk much, but it's obvious that there is a connection between he and Lorelai.  Their witty banter is some of the best on television.

There's Melissa McCarthy (Suki), Lorelai's friend and cook at the Inn.  She's a bubbly, energetic woman who's a bit clumsy despite her great culinary abilities, such as accidentally smashing a pan into the face of another chef.

There's Yanic Truesdale as the Inn's stuffy, French concierge who believes everyone else is a fool.  Great character and wonderfully played by Yanic.

Also, there is Keiko Agena as Rory's Korean best friend, Lane.

Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop play Lorelai's wealthy parents who live in Hartford, Connecticuit.  Both are fantastic actors and great additions to the show.

Alexis Bledel is the new-comer to acting.  Therefore, I cannot fault her for her portrayal of Rory Gilmore as a bit wooden and lacking a certain charisma.  This is most evident in the first half of the season.  Alexis picks up quick though, as she quickly is able to get a handle on her character.  I haven't seen any of the other seasons, so I'm going to assume that things improve for her.  She never takes away from the show, however.  But many times, seasoned actors can inadvertently show a contrast to someone who has little acting experience.

The town of Star's Hollow is the kind of place I've always dreamed of living.  It's fun, friendly, and has all the characters of a small town.  Season 1 focuses on Lorelai's re-connection with her parents as well as Rory's getting to know her grandparents.  It also focuses on possible romances for both women.

People may assume that this is a ""girl's"" show.  You'd be selling it short if you arrive at this conclusion without seeing it.  The acting is superb, the stories delightful, and the atmosphere fun and charming.

Give the Gilmore Girls a chance, and you'll find as I did, that they very quickly grow on you.",1132358400,4,3366,4.734939759036145
1987377,5,B0001CCXZW,"I had never seen this programme until very recently. It came up as one of Amazons recommendations to me in an email. I paid it no thought, not knowing anything at all about the show. However, when I noticed that it was airing on the Hallmark Channel here in the UK, I thought I would give it a watch. After 5 episodes aired, I had already ordered the first 3 series, and now, after completing the viewing of series 1, I have ordered series 4 and 5. This should emphasise to you all just how good this show is. To all of you who think it is just another teen show (I'm 43), it most certainly is not. It is a show about relationships, with comedy thrown in, and will appeal to all ages. Lauren Graham is just outstanding as Lorelai. Her prickly relationship with her Mother is a joy to behold. This programme is a departure for myself, my usual viewing is West Wing, 24, Red Dwarf, Blackadder and shows of that ilk. But I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending it to anyone who likes appealing characterisation, wonderful snappy dialogue and outstanding acting. 5 stars",1130889600,,1074,4.456852791878172
1987378,5,B0001CCXZW,"First and foremost, I must begin by saying that Gilmore Girls is the best television show I have seen in years. I must start with the cast. Lauren Graham couldn't be better for the role of the mother, Loralei Gilmore. And Rory wouldn't be Rory without Alexis Bledel's angelic appearance and amazing acting skills.

Gilmore Girls is a story of a young mother and daughter who, surprisingly, are best friends. Rory is 16 and Loralei is 32 (Loralei dropped out of highschool at 16 when she became pregnant with Christopher's baby). At the beginning of the season, Loralei wants Rory to go Chilton, a Connecticut prep school. But the only way in is to pay the costly tuition, and the only way to get the money is to ask dear mom and dad for the loan, which means in return, you will have to meet with them for dinner every Friday evening. And that, my friend, is the last thing Loralei wants to do after sixteen years of freedom from her pushy, proper, rich, and conniving parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore. But Rory must go to Chilton. So Loralei must go to dinner. Over the season, you are introduced to more and more characters. Luke Danes, the diner guy who never takes his hat off and hardly ever says a word. But Luke would do anything for Loralei because he has a crush on her. Then there is Dean, Rory's first boyfriend. Ahh, first love. Dean thinks nothing but of Rory and would do anything for her. Next is Lane Kim, Rory's best friend. Lane is Korean and her mother is very religious and strict. Which means, but of course, a lot of sneaking around. Then, there's Sookie St. James, best friend and coworker of Loralei. Sookie is bubbly, funny, and the world's best chef. Then comes Jackson, Sookie's future husband, but for now, the vegetable guy who has a major crush on Sookie. And Sookie, poor thing, is clueless. Michelle is Loralei's french coworker at the Independence Inn. And most of the time, she would love to slap him. Miss Patty is the town gossiper, an old beauty who still instructs dance lessons and is a little over the top. But every town has one of those. Next up is Taylor, town mayor, owner of everything, and Luke's arch enemy. Then there's Kirk, the town geek who has a lot of strange ideas. Moving on to Rory's classmates, Paris Geller, the perfectionist who needs a therapist and would like nothing better than to take smart and pretty Rory down. Madelyn and Louise are her possy that think nothing but of fashion and have brains the size of peanuts. Then there's Tristan, the preppy, stuck up, school hottie who is dying for Rory, but Rory hates him. Oh the drama. But the best thing about Gilmore Girls is how all these characters come together with their wacky personalities and create a bond. Stars Hollow is really the perfect, ideal small town filled with busy bodys. But that's to be expected. Loralei and Rory have an unexplainable bond and work perfectly together. Loralei's witty sense of humor ties it all together. With a brilliant cast, a brilliant writer, and a brilliant director, Gilmore Girls is everything you could hope for in a TV show. It's warm, funny, and sweet. It's one of a kind. And I hope this review has persuaded you to buy this season, because you're really missing out on something if you don't.

After catching the season's premiere on TV sometime back I immediately became a fan, waiting for a new episode every week. A mixture of witty scripting and smart smack on your face dialogue, this show captures life in both hands and spreads it all over a wide array of endearing characters.

And, don't even get me started on Luke, Suki, Rory...etc etc.

If you loved Northern Exposure like I did, there is something familiar here. The town is small. The cast of characters is both eccentric and eclectic. You'll love them while you want to strangle them....just like family.

1987414,5,B0001CCXZW,"Well, this show includes a number of elements that would normally put me off.  I am more often annoyed than charmed by casts of relentlessly quirky characters that are calculated to be lovable, but I was conquered by the Gilmore Girls. The show is just so well-written and refreshingly innocent and the cast is so good that I couldn't help watching most of the episodes with a big smile on my face.  The many distinctive personalities of Stars Hollow form a well-developed community worthy of comparison with Cicely, Alaska of ""Northern Exposure,"" the 4077th of ""MASH,"" and Mayberry of ""The Andy Griffith Show.""

Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are perfect as the mother-daughter pair of Lorelei and Rory who are more like sisters due to Lorelei's early pregnancy.  Lorelei's struggle to form a sane relationship with her mother (Kelly Bishop), Rory's attempts to fit in at the ritzy Chilton Academy, and both women's adventures in love provide the material for some fine television.  A standout episode is ""Rory's Dance,"" in which her genuinely joyful relationship with boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki) inadvertantly shames a roomful of cynical rich brats.",1123891200,,1157,5.132978723404255
1987415,5,B0001CCXZW,"The most appealing storyline for me is the Lorelei-Emily relationship. As much as I love the dynamics of Rory-Lorelei relationship, the Lorelei-Emily is the one that truly made me a fan of the show. And I guess season 1 gave us a lot of stories about that, because as the season goes on, even though they still have conflicts, they are in better terms now generally compared to the first 2 seasons.

The show is populated by great supporting characters, my favorite besides Emily of course (played to perfection by Kelly Bishop) is Paris (played effortlessly by Liza Weil), the overachiever who won't quit. I miss when Rory and Paris were archrivals. I also love the audiophile Lane, out of this planet Kirk, omnipresent Taylor, bowtied Richard, horny Miss Pattie and the sweet as candy Sookie.

Some of the standout episodes of Season 1 are:

-Pilot (one of the best pilots I have seen, great setup for the characters)

-The Lorelei's First Day at Chilton

-Rory's Birthday Parties

-Kiss and Tell

-Rory's dance (great dramatic showdown for Emily and Lorelei, ""She's gonna get pregnant like you"")

-Christopher Returns

-The breakup Part 2 (great Rory episode, and great ending)

-Ps I Lo.. (the reaction of Emily when Rory ran away and came to their house was priceless)

-Love, Daisies, and Troubadours (the season ended on a high note, how can you resist the two girls jumping like crazy at the end of the episode)

1987416,5,B0001CCXZW,"Nominated for 1 Emmy and 1 Golden Globe in its first five seasons, Gilmore Girls has experienced much greater success among TV viewers than among industry critics. In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...

Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...

The Gilmore Girls (Season 1) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the series premiere in which Rory is accepted to a very prestigious prep school named Chilton. But Lorelai struggles to come up with the tuition money necessary to send her, so she contacts her estranged parents for a loan. They agree to provide Rory with the tuition if Lorelai will agree to have a family dinner with them every Friday. Meanwhile, Rory has developed a crush on a recent transfer student, making her apprehensive about attending Chilton. When Lorelai finds out that a boy is the source of Rory's uncertainty, the two get in a fight with Lorelai fearing that Rory will follow in her own path of bad decisions. However, after the family dinner with Lorelai's parents, Rory realizes the sacrifice her mother has made in asking for the loan, and the two make up... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Forgiveness and Stuff"" in which a feuding Rory and Lorelai settle their differences just in time for Christmas, and ""The Third Lorelai"" in which Emily opposes her mother-in-law's offer to set up a trust fund for Rory because she's afraid it will mean an end to her contact with her granddaughter...

The DVD Report",1122422400,3,3849,4.957943925233645
1987417,5,B0001CCXZW,"There are only three shows that I know where the act of conversation is elevated to the status of high art:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE WEST WING (early seasons only), and THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Though these three shows may not have a great deal in common in other ways, all three revel in great talk.  Other shows have good talk, but these three have great, great talk.  Take just a sample, delivered at a machine gun pace:

GRANDMA: You were on the phone.
GRANDPA: Long distance.
LORELAI: God?
GRANDPA: London.
LORELAI: God lives in London?
GRANDPA: My mother lives in London.
LORELAI: Your mother is God?
GRANDPA: Lorelai.
LORELAI: So, God IS a woman...
GRANDPA: Lorelai.
LORELAI: And a relative, that's so cool. I'm gonna totally ask for favors.

Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, the self-proclaimed model for Lorelai Gilmore and the writer of an unreasonably large number of the brilliant screenplays, has an absolute genius for talk.  Few movies and no television series (apart from the above mentioned BUFFY and WEST WING-early-seasons-only) contain better talk.  I watch the episodes of this series with a persistent grin and an unceasing delight in the manner in which the show elevates mere talk to something greater than mere talk.  It is in many other ways a very good show, but what makes it exceptional is its gift for gab.

But it takes more than a great script filled with great talk.  It takes actors who can pull it off.  But luckily, THE GILMORE GIRLS is filled with a bevy of competent actors who are completely capable of handling every nuance of the script.  All are at least solid, but in Lauren Graham the show has someone who is exceptional.  The show would be very good even with a lesser actress, but she is absolutely perfect as Lorelai Gilmore.

There is never a point at which this show is ever less than completely entertaining, and it often puts me in mind of ""A Prarie Home Companion,"" with the way that you get to know each character in the town of Stars Hollow.  Although Lauren Graham dominates the show, the series in fact features an ensemble supporting cast, with each person bringing a perfect additional touch to the show.

And for all literate folks the show is an especial delight.  How many shows routinely drop names like Stella (from STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE), Proust, Oscar Levant, Marlon Perkins (the Wild Kingdom guy), Tolstoy, John Muir, Thoreau, and so forth, as well as extended discussions of ennui.  And the musical references are consistently cool:  PJ Harvey, Belle and Sebastian, Nico, Blur, and a host of others.  I get all the references, but I think even if you don't it would be fun for once not to have a show whose scripts are directed at the lowest common denominator but no higher.

I have to add that I love the interaction between Lorelai and Rory.  They have what is without question the finest onscreen relationship between parent and child on TV.  Oh, and I'd like to add that more than one person (well, two) has told me that Lorelai and Rory remind them of me and my daughter, so I like to keep that in mind when I watch the show.",1122336000,4,3105,4.665441176470588

1987420,5,B0001CCXZW,"This is a great show. The mother, Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Lorelai Gilmore AKA Rory live in the town of Stars-Hollow.

Lorelai and Rory are best friends. Lorelai is a very fun character she acts childish at times which makes the show great she also is a single parent. Rory is a great student and has wishes to go to Harvard.

Lorelai is the daughter of Emily and Richard Gilmore. When Lorelai had Rory she had moved out of the house and rarely keeps in touch with them. Now when Rory gets accepted to Chilton a private school she has to turn to her parents for money. Emily and Richard do give her the money to pay for the school on one condition, she and Rory have to go and have dinner with them every Friday. It wouldn't seem so bad if it weren't for the fact that Lorelai's parents drive her insane.

I haven't seen such a great show in a long time and I highly recommend it to everyone yes even guys I had my brother watch it and he likes it too.",1116547200,,960,4.150537634408602

I love everything about this season of this show. I love how Jackson catches Sookie buying someone else's strawberries. I love how Lorelai tells off her mother at the end of Rory's Dance. I love how Paris smiles as she watches her two best friends get yelled at by Lorelai. I love all the music. I love how the final scene in the last episode of the season gives a wonderful, joyous sense of closure, as if the writers were worried that there might not be a second season.

Simply put, the first season of Gilmore Girls stands very well on its own. And as far as I'm concerned, it's the only season of the show that I ever wanted to own.",1115078400,,804,4.147435897435898

I finally decided to pick up Season One and that's how I got hooked! The relationship between Rory and Lorelai is what you wish you had, and the relationship between Lorelai and Emily is often what you get! Some say it's overwritten, but if I wanted reality TV, I'd flip over to The Apprentice.

I loved it.,1108944000,4,328,4.306451612903226
1987441,5,B0001CCXZW,"Gilmore Girls is my favourite show. It is funny, dramatic, smart, and addicting. I have watched multiple discs of both seasons 1 and 2 in one sitting- the perfect way to waste a day. Make sure to have a pen and pad of paper near your hand so you can write down people to look up, books to read, and songs to sample. Many people I know don't watch Gilmore Girls for precisely the reasons I do: 1) it moves slowly and 2) you often don't know exactly what the cast is referencing (hence the pen and paper). Examples include the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Danny Kaye's ""Pellet with the Poison"" bit from ""The Court Jester.""

If you haven't been able to ""get into"" the series on TV because you felt lost, thought they were trying to be too witty, or were just all bad actors (a common misconception!) you should invest in this, and learn the reason why ""Oy with the Poodles already!"" is part of my daily vocabulary.",1108857600,3,919,4.374269005847953

Probably won't want to let your buddies on the softball team know that you're watching this show, but it's really a funny and interesting show.  It's a television show for people with brains.  The references to pop culture, hisorical figures, and literature remind me of similar references in The Simpsons.  Not kidding.  Pick it up at this great price and catch up with a season that you might have missed.",1107475200,7,463,4.654320987654321
1987463,5,B0001CCXZW,"It's said that certain shows sometimes take half a season or so to ""warm up"" before they really take off--not the case with ""Gilmore Girls""--the show established itself immediately and the whole first season remains continually addictive episode after episode.  The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel is uncanny and overwhelmingly convincing and endlessly entertaining.  The show does a great job of slipping in ""side stories"" for additional interest while keeping the focus primarily on the endeavors of Lorelai and Rory.  Essentially, all of the show's acting is excellent, including Scott Patterson's masterful portrayal of the Luke character, but it's Alexis Bledel who 'steals the show' again and again--granted, she's at an advantage in the sense that she's playing such a likeable character in the first place, however, she truly brings the Rory character to life in such a one-of-a-kind way that's pure genius.  Obviously a lot has already been said about ""Gilmore Girls"" and certainly no one in the right mind can deny it's a terrific show.  I'd just like to add that there's a wonderfully uplifting and human quality about ""Gilmore Girls""--to put it a certain way, it makes you realize that certain things that can happen in life are really not as catastrophic as they may appear.  ""Gilmore Girls"" serves as a reminder of the joyfulness that life can provide, as well as the importance of really learning from life's experiences.  Plus, there is some GREAT and intelligent humor in here that totally hits the spot, plus fun references to history, music, and more.  This 6 DVD set is excellently packaged and contains generous bonus material--add to this the consistent high quality of the show itself, this set easily justifies its price.  If you've never really watched ""Gilmore Girls"" much, or if you've missed a lot of episodes, this is an ideal way to start getting caught up, and where better to start than the beginning!",1106352000,4,1951,5.071875

1987465,5,B0001CCXZW,"I started watching Gilmore Girls when I was two months pregnant.  I had something in common with Lorelei Gilmore.  I was young and I was pregnant.  I looked to the show for inspiration while I went through the lonely weeks of pregnancy.  She was strong, she made it, and Rory was healthy and intelligent.

Now my son is six months old and I'm still watching the show faithfully.  I started watching the show in the middle of the 4th season and became really curious on what the first few seasons were about.  I decided to purchase the first season on DVD.

I was not disappointed by the DVD.  I really wish there were more extras.  It did seem like there was an odd ""echoing"" quality to the audio at times which became jarring.  However, any Gilmore Girls fan knows that nothing matters except the story.  And what a fine story it is.

Lorelei Gilmore was 16 years old when she became pregnant and delivered a healthy baby girl.  In her delirius state, she decided to name her daughter afer herself -- Lorelei Gilmore.  Shortening the name, her now-16-year-old daughter goes by the nickname Rory.  The show explores the mother-daughter relationship of Lorelei and Rory as well as their relationship with the outside world.  Lorelei, a coffee-aholic and non-cooker, spends most of her eating hours at ""Luke's"", a diner.  Luke is a grouchy man, but has a lot of charm.  Lorelei spends her working hours at the Independence Inn, where she rose from a lowly maid to the manager, second only to the owner.  There we explore a relationship with Michel, a French.. well.. jerk, and Lorelei's best friend Sooki!  Sooki is an accident waiting to happen, but good hearted and loving.

On the other hand, Lorelei's parents aren't so good hearted or loving.  At least, on the surface they aren't.  Emily Gilmore is a control freak who desires to run her daughters life.  Richard Gilmore is a Top Dawg at some company where he makes beaucoup money.  While Lorelei lives a middle class life, her parents are upper class.

There are a lot more tangles and subplots to this fascinating story.  And, if I was willing to name my daughter after Lorelei, then shouldn't you at least check it out?  :)",1104796800,7,2180,4.648293963254593

The Gilmore Girls is one of the most intelligent and hilarious shows I've ever watched.  The rapid fire manner in which the entire cast communicates seems so weird at first, but eventually you get used to it and the dialogue flows better and more realistically than most reality shows.  The casting on this show is also trememendous with a few exceptions.  Suki (please excuse my spelling of characters names) sucks.  She's an obnoxious stupid cook who is so darn annoying!  Lane is interesting, but barely in the show enough to matter, and all of Rory's Chilton friends are shallow and 2-dimensional largely because the actors playing them are no good.  The Gilmores themselves, including Grandma and Grandpa are amazingly fun to watch though.  The lead roles (including Luke) are hilarious and enjoyable in basically every episode.

1987507,5,B0001CCXZW,"Up front, TV shows that like to showcase a too-good-to-be-true view of the world give me the cooties.  The Gilmore Girls, though partaking of some of that fantasy small town Americana, transcends its apparent limitations to be perhaps the best dramody currently on the tube.  Aside from the great Lorelei/Rory two kinds of people in the world/who do you like best test (currently I'm tending towards Lorelei since Rory cut off her hair and became a homewrecker), the non-stop snappy writing and admirable narrative pacing set this series way apart from the squirming drivel filling the airwaves.  Sure, the characters and setting are theoretically way too cute, but the acting chops displayed by Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (particularly) are first-rate, gloriously complimenting the fine writing and direction of the show.  All this and a family-friendly content that still maintains its edge and hipness.  Great music (though the Carol King theme song is not my fave), two of the most magically delicious female leads in television, and a densely meaty narrative that holds up as individual shows and a compelling meta story.  Bledel is a magnetic performer who will hopefully break out at some point; she is a natural actor of consummate skill, amazing for someone who pretty much started out from scratch in the series.

AND IT IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S SHOW!!

Definitely start from the beginning and savor the first season DVD.  Rory Falling In Love is a wonderful story arc, played for sentiment but not sentimental.  Lauren Graham is fabulously watchable and an actress on a par with the apex of 40's screwball comedy. The ancillary characters are a bit sketchy in the first season, though Scott Patterson's unrequited Luke is a resonant performance of note.",1096675200,7,1766,5.058620689655172
1987508,5,B0001CCXZW,In Ireland we don't get the Gilmore Girls that often and they tend to mess up the order and leave out episodes. I travelled to the US during the summer and bought this box set. Obviously enough it doesn't work on the European DVD players -so i went out and bought a region free DVD player especially! That is how good this DVD is. The Gilmore Girls is hilarious quick-witted and sweet all at the same time. To be honest there isn't enough of a fuss made about the program over here which is a little annoying. If you like comedy and great story lines then this DVD is the way to go. There is no way you could possibly be disappointed! Personally I just can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD!,1096329600,7,703,4.176470588235294
1987509,5,B0001CCXZW,"It is refreshing to see this great show as it began.  I missed most of the 1st and 2nd seasons, and caught up with many on reruns and the remainder on this DVD set.  I absolutely love the show and where it has gone over the past 4 seasons.

As for other reviewers who have a hard time dealing with Rory's ""loss of innocence"" as of late, HELLO, the character is a 19 year old college student when she loses her virginity.  That is old for today's standard, and the writers likely figured (and rightly so) that it would not be possible for her to remain a virgin forever.  And I also didn't see much ""bed-hopping.""  One guy (while he is questionable b/c married) is hardly ""hopping.""  Also, it is a common situation in real life and the writers want to portray situations that may happen in a life well lived.  Personally, I think they did it just to put a period at the end of the ""Dean"" issue.  What better way than to make him a philanderer?  And, seriously, ""Murphy Brown"" references are so ridiculous at this point in time that I hesitate to even type those two words in my review.  Not gonna go there...

This is a great television show, smart, funny, and superbly acted and written.  The characters, while extreme caricatures in a small town, show true human emotion that successfully draws fans of all ages to the show.  I just can't wait for the second season to be released!  The special features on the DVD set are better than I have seen on other sets, and the little booklet guide of each episode is very handy.  I would actually have liked to see some outtakes of scenes where the actors flub their lines, because you know it must happen from time to time with the rapid-fire delivery of those complex sentences!!

To sum up, BUY IT!  You won't be disappointed!",1095897600,2,1773,4.403076923076923
1987510,4,B0001CCXZW,"The design of this boxed set is superb. The special features were a bonus, though I was hoping for much more. Commentaries over a few of the episodes would have been nice, as would a few more outtakes, but the set is generally worth the money.

As for content, I can echo that it is witty, well-written and equally well-acted by regulars and guest stars alike. A fine production. I would like to point out, however, for those thinking this is a family forum drama, that Lorelai Gilmore stands for everything but family. She made it clear from the beginning that she wants very little to do with her own parents, whom she openly despises, and never wanted to start a family of her own with Rory's father, whom she never married. She can be applauded for opting out of abortion and for raising Rory 'a-la-Murphy Brown' into the young woman we find here in season one. However, Lorelai sets no good example for her blossoming young daughter by hopping into bed with Rory's teacher, ending that relationship abruptly when Rory finds out and flips out, then sleeping with Rory's dad when he happens to pop into town for a quick visit after many years away. At season one's end Lorelai is back in the teachers' sack, hiding the renewed relationship from her daughter. (The lie of omission is still deception.) Rory finds out and flips out again, which only compounds her angst as she tries to determine what LOVE is and if she has it for Dean, who broke up with her after he confessed his love and she did not verbally reciprocate.

Having just seen the opening episode for the latest season, I can tell you that season one is the most innocent; it goes quickly down hill from there. Rory is now not only hopping from one bed to another and back again - like her mother - but she is now a full-blown, 'my needs are all that matter' adulteress. Rory's friend Lane, a once sweet but now jaded anti-Christian, when finding out about Rory's latest sex-capade with the now married Dean at Miss Patty's studio, remarks ""Miss Patty would be proud!"" This current moral attitude is far removed from season one's ""Rory's Dance"" episode where Dean and Rory innocently fell asleep at Miss Patty's, causing jaws to drop all over Stars Hollow.

If you enjoyed the quirky characters of Stars Hollow when they first appeared on our little screens, you should find these 22 episodes well worth watching again. Having seen where this Bedford Falls-ish berg eventually decends, however, has got me considering whether to waste my time and emotions on the remaining seasons.",1095811200,,2548,4.6703786191536745

My biggest complaint with this set is the lack of extra features.  There are NO commentary's at all, and very few behind the scenes stuff.

1987543,5,B0001CCXZW,"My ex-girlfriend first suggested this show to me last year, and I was skeptical.  I thought it would be some boring soap opera, and I really didn't care for the premise.  But, this show is so good and entertaining that, I can't stop watching it.

The funny thing is, I can't figure out what I love about it, and why it's better than other shows I like a lot such as Dawson's Creek, and 7th Heaven.  The chemistry is probably the part that gets me the most, especially between our central characters:  Lorelai and Rory, Lorelai and Emily, Sookie and Lorelai, Sookie and Jackson, Luke and Lorelai, Rory and Paris, Rory and Lane.  It's well scripted and the acting is top notch.

Besides all that, what else is there?  The story arc is fantastic, as bland as it could have been.  Lorelai is a 32 year old mother of a teenage daughter, Rory, who's almost 16.  Lorelai has raised her daughter on her own in a small town called Stars Hollow, in Connecticut, along with some help with many great friends along the way (Luke, Bebe + Maury, Miss Patty, Sookie St. James, and Rory's best friend Lane, and soon to enter would be Paris, and Dean.).  The best part is that nobody really has a background role.  All the roles are pretty important to each character in some way, and it's all connected.  A lot of real life situations are met along the way:  Rory starts a new school, Rory's first kiss, Lorelai and Rory's english teacher date, Rory's school dance and not being home by curfew, pressures by an overbearing mother and father, class differences, jealousy, birth out of wedlock, etc.  All are taken seriously, but are not over done, nor are they melodramatic as they are in shows such as Dawson's Creek, or even Full House.

I think what I love most is how much I see in Rory and Lorelai's great relationship.  I see a lot of me in both of them (even though I am male).  And their mother-daughter relationship is very familiar to me.  It's nice to see that kind of thing on TV, something that not all families get to share.  That awesome closeness, coupled with the dark juxtaposition between Lorelai, and her mom.

This show really is for everyone, and I really encourage everyone to check this show out.  You won't be disappointed, I promise.",1094169600,2,2242,4.511166253101737

The show is extremely well-written with sundry movie, tv, music, theater and historical references included as part of the every day banter. This is not your usual TV script and reminds me of Tracy-Hepburn movies. And the Gilmore Girls cast is excellent throughout!
I don't usually buy TV shows on DVD since you can almost always find them in syndication, but my partner and I can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. Unfortunately, I'm forbidden to watch any of the current season until we catch up!

WB is not being fair by producing this series in low quality DVD transfer because they've done a good job with ""Smallville"". I hope they won't repeat the same mistake in the future.

1987618,5,B0001CCXZW,"I am sure every one has their own reference point for viewing ""Gilmore Girls,"" especially if they really like the show.  Since I am neither a mother nor a daughter my frame of reference is not in the real world but in the ghost of a television show past, namely ""Moonlighting.""  This might strike some of your as odd, but on ""Gilmore Girls"" the average script for an episode is usually 75-80 pages versus the 45-50 for a normal hour-long television program, which was pretty much the math I remember from Glenn Gordon Caron's hit series (1985-89) which reminded America who Cybil Shepherd was and introduced the world to Bruce Willis.  The nice thing about ""Gilmore Girls"" is that unlike Dave and Maddie we do not need to fear that Lorelai and Rory will do the same thing to mess up their chemistry (they will have to find some other way).

Set in the storybook Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, which is populated by an eccentric mix of folks, the Gilmore girls are 32-year-old Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and 16-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel).  When Lorelai was Rory's age she became an unwed mother, to the disappointment of her parents (Kelly Bishop and Edward Herrmann), not to mention generations of Gilmore ancestors probably going back to the ""Mayflower."" But Lorelai has carved out her own life, managing an inn, and having a relationship with Rory which is more like best friends than mother and daughter.  The only problem is that Rory has her heart set on going to Harvard and being able to attend Chilton, a private school in Hartford, would be a big help.  That means Lorelai has to ask her parents for help and the price is steep: every Friday Lorelai and Rory have to go to dinner at the Gilmore mansion.  Good thing Lorelai really loves her daughter a whole bunch.

I can explain why I like ""Gilmore Girls"" simply by pointing out that on Disc 6 of ""The Complete First Season"" where we have the episode ""Rory's Dance"" enhanced by pop ups explaining all the pop culture, historical, and other references, I did not need any of them.  In fact, I caught a couple of lines where I thought they could have added some pop ups.  I am a bit weak on current musical groups, but fortunately Rory has eclectic tastes in such regards, so there are still more hits than misses.  Absolutely true that people do not talk like this in the real world, but they should, even if that means you have to put up with a lot of eye rolling and sighs being heaved your way.

The supporting cast is wonderful.  Melissa McCarthy as Sookie St. James may well be the Willow of the thirtysomething generation and if Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) are the last too people in town to know they are meant for each other they will have to catch on eventually, 1000 yellow daisies not withstanding.  Keiko Agena as Lane Kim and Liza Weil as Paris Geller provide the polar opposites of Rory's divided teenage existence for the female gender with Jared Padalecki as Dean Forester and Chad Michael Murray as Tristan DuGrey doing the duty for the other side.

But the heart of this series is indeed the Gilmore girls, all three of them.  Graham is like a standup comedienne who does not mind if no one gets her cracks because she knows how good they are even if others are waiting for the pop ups.  Bledel, whose only previous credit was as an extra in ""Rushmore,"" is simply someone that the camera loves and who has a way of speaking that is even more endearing.  Then there is Bishop as Lorelai's mother, a picture of being prim and proper but desperate to maintain contact with her daughter, even though she is loathe admitting it.  Lorelai and her mother have a reputation that has been deeply damaged, perhaps irrevocably; but that is why we have to stay tune.  Meanwhile Rory is building a relationship with her grandparents at those Friday night dinners separate from the existing hostility.

The series is unique it that it is the first series to make it to the air supported by the Family Friendly Forum's Script Development Fund, an initiative between some of the nation's top advertisers and the WB network.  The show was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, who previously worked on the situation comedies ""Roseanne"" and ""Veronica's Closet.""  I was told my several people that I should watch ""Gilmore Girls"" when it started on the WB in the 2000-2001 series, but it aired on Thursday nights opposite other shows I was already watching and as mentioned above my sense of gender identification with the lead characters is rather limited.  Fortunately shows like ""Gilmore Girls,"" ""Roswell,"" and other series I should have been watching but missed are available on DVD.  The problem is that the show just finished its fourth season and how am I supposed to catch up so I can get on track?",1085356800,8,4769,4.647619047619048
1987619,5,B0001CCXZW,"How wonderful it is to see these episodes, absent of the commercials and all the ""WB"" promo nonsense. This is truly a classic, a show from which I pick up new things each viewing....as the fast dialogue often slips by the first time around. [""Do you like duck?"" ""Only if its made with chicken.""]
My few ""nits"" would be in having the menu default to ""play all"" instead of ""episodes"" and not having one of the cast members do commentary.
The pluses far outweigh the minuses though. The packaging is beautiful. The clarity of the transfers is crisp and clean.
One can only hope that the other seasons are also released. {Anyone know if the seasons done in HDTV are also widescreen?)
One other issue....am I the only one who would love to see Lauren Graham's ""M.Y.O.B."" released to DVD?",1084752000,5,782,4.5928571428571425
1987620,5,B0001CCXZW,"Gilmore Girls is one of the best written shows on TV. The loveable characters will draw you in and provide a great viewing experience for the whole family. Watching this show is like eating a big of your favorite potato chips with dip (except that Mrs. Kim would approve of the show.)
The packaging, episode guide booklet and navigational menus pay tribute to the character oriented nature of the show by featuring largely unseen publicity shots of the characters.
Upon insertion, the DVDs bring up to the main menu quickly and none of them include mandatory commercials. Menu navigation is clean and simple. The main menu has the typical repetitious music which, no matter how charming it is the first time, quickly becomes irksome. The rest of the menus are mercifully mute.
The menu easily allows all episodes on the disk to be played straight through as well as allowing individual episode and chapter selection. Unlike DVD sets from some other shows, the only chapter points are at commercial breaks. This is a shame because it's the little moments that really make Gilmore Girls special. Adding more chapters to make individual scenes more accessible would have been a simple way to add value to this set. Another omission is the ability to skip the ""previously on Gilmore Girls"" recaps which are common, especially in later seasons. Hopefully these things will be corrected in future sets.
The set doesn't include any audio commentaries. Future sets probably won't either since WB won't pay anyone to do them and the actors involved are to high a caliber to donate their time to making someone else rich.
The ""making-of"" special includes interviews with the actors, producers Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, and the director of the pilot. It is nice if for no other reason than to put faces with the names that appear in the writing credits for so many episodes.
""Gilmore goodies and gossip"" is basically the episode ""Rory's Dance"" with pop-up video type background on the actors and explanations of the various references.
""Gilmore-isms"" is a collage of some of the shows crazy references.
""Deleted scenes"" consists of scenes cut from 3 different episodes. They are poorly prefaced and give the impression that they were added just so that the studio could advertise the set as having deleted scenes.
In summery: the price is steep and the extras are few but, as with all good shows, the episodes themselves are the selling point that really matters. I recommend this show to everyone.",1084579200,22,2505,4.95249406175772

1987622,5,B0001CCXZW,"Gilmore Girls is one the best-written, well acted shows on television.  The program bounces along at a breakneck pace, filled witty dialogue and banter between characters that are reminiscent of Hollywood films of the 30's and 40's.  The show focuses on the mother-daughter relationship between Lorelei (Lauren Graham) & Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) who are really best friends. Lorelei comes from a wealthy Hartford family and got pregnant at sixteen and moved to a small Connecticut hamlet called Stars Hollow to raise Rory. Lorelei runs the local Independence Inn and Rory is an incredibly gifted high school student.  The show's plots are built around the girl's relationship which each other and the conflicting lives Lorelei leads.  One is her life in Stars Hollow, which is filled with quirky residents and odd town events.  The other is with her estranged parents (Kelly Bishop & Edward Hermann), whose blue-blooded ways rankle with her free spirit.  Lorelei is forced to take her parents help in order to pay for Rory's tuition at the prestigious Chilton School which will help Rory try to fulfill her dream of going to Harvard.  As a condition of giving her the money, Lorelei and Rory must attend weekly Friday dinners at their house.  These dinners lead to numerous confrontations between Lorelei and her parents throughout the season.  The residents of Stars Hollow provide comfort and friendship to the Gilmores.  Among them are the gruff and grumpy Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) who owns the local diner, Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) who is Lorelei's best friend and chef at the inn and Michel Gerard (Yanic Truesdale) who is desk manager at the inn and is incredibly sarcastic.  Ms. Graham is a revelation in her role.  She commands every scene she is in and she can deftly deliver the rapid-fire dialogue that is in every show.  She is one of the most over-looked and underrated actresses on television.  The extras on the disk are as good as any on tv show box set.  One interesting extra is a pop-up video version of the ""Rory's Dance"" episode.  A big trademark of the show are the incredible amount of pop culture references included in each episode.  This extra provides you with a pop-up each time one is made and in the pop-up, it tells you where the reference is from.

We got the DVD less than a week ago, and she's watched most of the episodes twice already.

The DVD set (at long last, and by the way, when does seasons 2, 3 and 4 follow?) is a great value.

1987627,5,B0001CCXZW,"If you've only seen the recent episodes of Gilmore Girls and didn't see the first two seasons, then you are missing out on 43 of the finest episodes in television history.  This boxed set contains the first season which was truly wonderful (although the second season was even that much better, striking just the right balance between whimsy and sentiment).

Nevertheless the first season is a gem, capable of being viewed as a self-contained story in its own right.  More than any other season in the series, the episodes from the first season display a level of craftsmanship and directing that are rarely seen on television, particularly network television.  Many of the episodes are like five act plays, intricately constructed and choreographed.  Witness the cooking scene in the first episode, or note how both the first and last episode conclude with Yo La Tengo's ""My Little Corner.""  Perhaps because the renewal of the series may have been in doubt, the season builds to a dramatic climax in the season finale that brilliantly works both as a finale and as a springboard into later episodes.

Gilmore Girls combines witty dialogue, comedy, drama, sentiment, quirky characters, social satire, and even a little bit of the surreal with an ambitious directing style more often seen in cinema than on television.  At its best (i.e. its first two seasons), it is a kindred spirit of ""Northern Exposure"" that carries the torch of inspired writing about unique characters living a kind of idyllic, literate, Bohemian existence.  Stars Hollow, like Cicely, is the kind of place and lifestyle you dreamed about living in when you were young and idealistic, and allows you to return to those ideals and live them vicariously through Lorelai, Rory, and the rest of the colorful characters of Stars Hollow.",1084147200,,1803,5.023489932885906

1987673,5,B0001CCXZW,"In the true Gilmore style (Pro/Con list), I thought I'd add my 2 cents about the Season 1 DVD set.
Pros:
-Packaged beautifully, all 6 disks in one booklike case.
-The included booklet has all kinds of good information-show names, original release dates, directing and writing credits, episode summaries and chapter listings.
-Special Features:
  *""Welcome to Gilmore Girls"" is a cute behind-the-scenes kind of look at what went into making Gilmore girls happen. Nice interviews with cast members about auditions and the show's obscure references. It'd be nice if they continued this for each season's set.
  *""Gilmore Goodies and Gossip"" haven't watched it all the way through yet, but this feature is a ""Pop Up Video"" kind of feature on the ""Rory's Dance"" episode that gives us extra information. (You can also watch the episode without the goodies, they're on 2 seperate disks.)
  *""Gilmore-isms"" is a montage of cute little phrases/references said in Gilmore girls.
-Clarity. This is a big Duh since it's a DVD set, but I've been watching old, VHS-taped episodes, so it's nice to see them with the right colors!
-Shipping through Amazon was practically overnight, very impressed.
-And the biggest Pro of all...Gilmore girls on DVD, period!
Cons:
-Additional Scenes: There are only three. I wish there were more of them.
-Special Features: They're all nice, but I would have really liked to see something like bloopers/outtakes. I bet they'd be hilarious.
-No episode listing anywhere besides the little booklet. Meaning, to figure out what disk to put in to watch ""Kiss and Tell,"" you have to look in the little booklet. No listings by or on the actual DVDs.

1987675,5,B0001CCXZW,"I got hooked on this show about a year ago and have loved it ever since. I'm so glad they released season one so I can finally catch up with what all I have missed. Lauren Graham is tremendous as Lorelai and the way she interacts with her daughter is a treat. Growing up while being the child of a single parent, I respect the way that Lorelai treats Rory and the maturity involved in their relationship. Some may complin that the dialogue is a bit ""wordy"" or developed, but I say that Stars Hollow resembles a typical New England town where intelligence is the common. Special shout goes out to Sally Struthers as Babette (so sad when her cat dies) and Carole King who sings the opening theme (and later appears as a music store owner).",1083715200,,737,4.386861313868613

This show has a biting quick wit. Now on DVD, I can watch some of my favorite episodes any time I want, and I find as I watch, not only am I recalling some of my favorite lines and puns, but I'm catching jokes I missed the first time around, and I am still laughing and still being surprised. This show is suitable for families to watch together, and enjoy quality time together as the Gilmore Girls do. This show is fresh, current with loads of pop culture references peppered through to keep you on your toes.  Thank you WB for finally releasing the gilmore girls to be accessable, flowing out among the people with their brilliant humor and tongue twisting gymnastics.
thank you
everyone enjoy!!!!!",1083715200,2,874,4.531645569620253

you see i am from australia and well as you know it is only available in  AMERICA (as usual) and canada because of coding or some nonsence.
gilmore girls is shown in many differenr countries, usually behind the US. how much longer will we have to wait for the dvd if they are a total season ahead of us on tv?
well that is my only complaint and hopefully someone will read this and help, if possible cause i know there are many fans of the gilmore girls around the world who would love to be able to collect alll the episodes on dvd to keep as memorabilia of such a great show!!!!!!!",1083715200,3,693,4.0583941605839415

1987721,5,B0001CCXZW,"A written description of Gilmore Girls can do the series no justice. The rapid-fire writing is some of the sharpest on television, the plots are rarely, if never, cliche and the large stable of characters never fails to make you laugh. It's rare for a show to strike a perfect balance between comedy and drama with no sappiness attached, but Gilmore Girls succeeds and truly breaks new ground.

1987726,5,B0001CCXZW,"Gilmore Girls is one of the best shows on television, and it's DVD release is long overdue. The show is well written, well acted, and it takes a matter of seconds before you're engrossed in the story line. The show has been exceptional since the pilot, and has continued to please. The first season introduces us to Stars Hollow, Chilton, and Hartford. We meet the kooky residents of the Gilmore's hometown, the spoiled Chiltonites, and Richard and Emily Gilmore, Lorelai's parents who could be her polar opposites. Many of these characters are still important today. Sookie, Luke, Paris, Miss Patty, etc... Plus, we meet Tristan DuGrey. What more could a girl ask for?",1081468800,6,669,4.929203539823009
1987756,5,B0001CCXZW,"I started watching Gilmore Girls about half way through the first season. Of course as a fortysomething single male, I couldn't tell anyone! But as the years have past, it now seems that the word is out on one of the best written Television shows of all time. The first season is of course the best one. As is the case for most shows. The characters are new and you can't wait to get to know them. The relationship between Lorelai (mom) and Rory (daughter) is so real that you can't help loose yourself in their struggles to make it through what life dishes out. The thing that I have always liked most about the show is it's fairy tale approach. The comedy is always there, the too good to be real hometown, the quirky townspeople it's just a joy, and yet it's real when it needs to be, but never quite being a soap. I can't recomend the DVD enough. I'm planing on talking it with me to the nursing home someday cause it (Gilmore Girls) will stand the test of time. Hope you all enjoy it as much.",1080950400,,997,4.252631578947368

1987758,5,B0001CCXZW,This show had a remarkable season. All 21 eps are great. The characters of Rory( Alexis Bledel) and Lorali (Lauren Gram) share a great dynamic. They bring you into there lives and make it impossible not to love them and impossible not to stay glued to you tv awaiting what will happen next. I love GG! And I have watched it from the very beginning. I cannot wait for the second and third season to be released also.,1079740800,,415,4.333333333333333
1987759,5,B0001CCXZW,"For a long time there were people out there, myself included who suspected that West Wing scribe Aaron Sorkin may have been moonlighting over on Gilmore Girls.  His trademarked fast-speak, witty observations and fascinating characters are apparent on both shows.  We were wrong though.
Both shows have amazing ensemble casts and writing that defies description.  With Angel going away after this season I am left with only three shows to Tivo each week.  Gilmore Girls, West Wing and The Shield.  It's hard to lament that fact though when looking at the quality of what remains behind.
My wife and I want to find this quaint, little, New England township and move there.  The characters on the periphery of the show are positively Rockwellian, yet quirky, intelligent and interesting.  Don't even get me started on the Gilmores themselves.  These are the kinds of people wifey and I love to hang around with; incredibly well read, almost painfully intelligent, yet whimsical, fun loving and sometimes just plain silly.  We love visiting with them every Tuesday night and can't wait to catch up on some good old times once this DVD boxed set comes in.",1078272000,45,1150,4.947916666666667

1987763,5,B0001CCXZW,"As a large fan of this series, I believe the first season was one of the best and a must-see, must-buy for any fan. The first season of Gilmore Girls was the most charming of them all, like many other shows, it set a high standard for its following seasons.
Many good things about the first season was that the viewers almost saw the lives of the Gilmores as if they'd been a part of it. The show developed the story in a clear way that there was no confusion or ""catching up"", but instead you could follow along with the witty dialogue and enjoy it's originality.
Many good characters came with the first season (Luke, Tristan, Dean, Babette,etc.), and it was good to see the characters develop.
Everything was new in this season, Rory first started at Chilton, the prestigious prep school; Lorelai, Rory, Richard, and Emily finally were able to come together as a family; Rory met her first boyfriend; and all in all the brilliance just radiated from the scripts. The cast was perfectly chosen, and when watching the episodes their performances provide some of the best talent seen on television.
This would be a great purchase for anyone who's a fan or who wants to catch up on the old times. I would highly recommend buying this DVD set.",1076803200,10,1241,4.569506726457399

As a father of a teenage daughter I have watched the Gilmore Girls to ensure that the content is age appropriate. This is pure ""chick flick"" material not at all for macho guys like you or me. The dialogue, the story and the character development are targeted at girls. The 5 stars is from my daughter who loves the show. The mother would drive anyone insane, she acts like a sister and is so far removed from the personality of a real parent that the show is unwatchable,at least for this male.",1076803200,2,501,4.397849462365591

1987804,5,B0001CCXZW,"I am an avid Gilmore Girls fan! I absolutely love the show, mostly because it reminds me so much of my own life. My mom was only 17 when she had me, so I have a lot in common with Rory, and my mother and I have a very similar relationship. My mom and I love watching the show together, but she didn't start watching it with me until almost the end of the 3rd season, so now we will be able to watch it together from the start. I even got to go to the Warner Brothers studios and I got a tour of the whole set and I got to watch Lauren Grahm, Alexis Bidel and Scott Patterson film a scene in the infamous diner!!!

1987806,5,B0001CCXZW,"I have to admit that I'm as macho as the next guy. I like action movies, sci-fi and comedy. When I first heard of Gilmore Girls I just wrote it off as another show that I would skip. That is until I actually saw an episode. That one episode opened my eyes and forced me to expand my definition of quality television. I have never encounted a show whose dialogue was so SHARP and yet managed to stay so close to how real people would react. The charecters, both main and in the background, are memorable and unique. And I will say to anyone who asks, whoever made the decision to cast the parts of Rory and Lorilei were absolutely brilliant. The chemistry between the two just takes your breath away. It blows my mind that I have to keep reminding myself that they are not mother and daughter in real life. I think what ultimately draws me as a viewer is that way it perfectly mixes sharp dialogue, drama, humor, and most of all the way it shows not just whats going on on the surface of a person but underneath as well. I still proudly call myself a guy. Its just that now guys who are into quality television have Gilmore Girls to add to their list as well",1076198400,56,1157,4.239819004524887

Contrived situations, silly love triangles, fickle girls, and characters too lazy to make their own coffee or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, they go to a place called Luke's to be waited on. I don't know what happened to the main protagonists in this series, the slutty mom and her daughter, and I don't care. There's too much good stuff out there to waste time with silly series like this puff piece.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.
