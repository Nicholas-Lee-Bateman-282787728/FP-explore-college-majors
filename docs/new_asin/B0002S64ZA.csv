8030983,1,B0002S64ZA,"Really dissapointed with the movie. Not one of his best (Mark Harmon), either Kirsty Allen. Supposed to be a comedy (black comedy), but I didn't find the comedy in it.",1366848000,,167,4.6
8030984,5,B0002S64ZA,"A very tan, very lean and fit Mark Harmon. Plot was standard 80's quirky romantic comedy. It was fun to see some of the bigger names as they once were when younger. A cute movie, and hey Mark Harmon in short shorts on the beach, tan and near pools - what more do you need in a movie! ;) Definately what I put in on a Rainy Wednesday.",1312934400,8,333,3.911764705882353
8030985,4,B0002S64ZA,"Adorable movie.  Early acting works of many actors that are well loved even today.  Mark Harmon does have the best smile in the industry and it is over powering in this movie.  Believe this is the first movie that Mark and Kirstie Allie did together, Summer School being the second.  Both are good to watch for fun and with kids (although there is one partial nudity scene towards the end, with 2 girls exposed breasts)  Bought this from Amazon but, the movie is prepriced in a 3"" x 3"" price tag at 3.99 and Amazon is charging and charged me 7.99.  Buy the movie for fun.  If you are a Mark Harmon or Kirstie Allie fan, you will enjoy.",1245542400,16,635,4.285714285714286
