8533190,5,B004PZPO98,"Kids ages 3-9 like to watch  it.
It has two movies: The Esrog and Yakov And Eliyahu.
It contains also a documentary film on how this movies was made and Alef-Bet letters to learn.
Thought the documentary is more for adults, since not all the makers are frum looking.
Still very recommend.
My 3 years old can't stop watching it!",1372377600,,327,4.45
