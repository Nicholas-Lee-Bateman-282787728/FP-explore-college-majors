8447909,5,B004Y3G1NE,"This is a terrific movie.  It is the story of a family whose wealthy patriarch is dying in a Paris hospital.  As his family arrives from Spain and Argentina to be by side in his final days, one of the sons uncovers a secret that has been guarded well by the father for years.  The plot addresses themes such as European fascism, homosexuality, and family unity.  Wonderful performances are given by Leonardo Sbaraglia, Geraldine Chaplin, and Fernando Fernn Gmez.
