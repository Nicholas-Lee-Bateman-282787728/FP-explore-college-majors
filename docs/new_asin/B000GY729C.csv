2620399,4,B000GY729C,I thought this was a great movie.  I am planning a surfing trip to Peru and this helped me get an idea of what to expect.  I hope I don't get robbed!,1245369600,,149,3.625
2620400,5,B000GY729C,Excellent movie about the surfing in Peru with some of the culture in it. A lot of differnt spots. A well done movie.,1243468800,,117,4.130434782608695
2620401,4,B000GY729C,"This is more than a surf flick; it's a real movie in the tradition of other Brown family members' work (Endless Summer, Step Into Liquid). I would put it into the travel/adventure genre and on the DVD there's a bonus documentary of the filming of the movie. Both would appeal to anyone who has been to Peru or is contemplating a trip there. It even includes the obligatory trip to Machu Picchu. If you're a surfer and want nothing but non-stop cutbacks, floaters, backside hacks and the occasional aerial, try Hit & Run by Taylor Steele. I can dig it but for a film to show your non-surfing friends without boring them to death - that has all that and a lot more - check this out.",1214870400,,680,4.362204724409449
2620402,4,B000GY729C,"We watched this one as a family last night and enjoyed much of it. It was a solid effort and it carries the same beautiful vibe as the Endless Summer. Fun for the whole family, though it would take just a bit more for me to give it 5 stars (let's be realistic here). I saw it featured for the first time yesterday on the ""Summer Picks"" table at a local bookstore. I would have picked it up here if I hadn't had a gift card to get rid of. It's worth adding to your collection. So where's the soundtrack?",1214006400,,502,4.03
2620403,4,B000GY729C,"This video is a little different from the mainstream of the young guns series and whatnot. It goes into talking about the country of Peru itself and its history of the sport (which may surprise you). Of course there is amazing scenery and incredible beaches with no crowds that can just get you all sorts of excited, and then it shows a little more of the traveler/adventurer lifestyle of the surfers taking the trip.

All and all, I really enjoy the video from the laid back music they play to the great surf they show. This is the perfect video after a long surf when all you want is to throw back a beer and take a nap with a video in the background. Enjoy!",1212624000,,660,4.28
2620404,5,B000GY729C,"Peel The Peru Project stands out as a very well depicted documentary of some of the several small villages on the long peruvian coastline, where fishing and wave surfing are part of the daily life among its people -men and women alike-, and how some expert US american surf sportsmen (from Hawaii and California) share their experiences in this land together with peruvian locals. It is really nice to see the always laidback and respectful north americans enjoying their stay at the sea and the cultural history Per had to offer to them. And of course, together with the also expert peruvian sportsmen/-women, led by surfing champion Luis Miguel (Magoo) de la Rosa as overall trip guide, they all show us excellent scenes of surfing. Although unfortunately there can be a very few cases of robbery (just very briefly handled in the film), particularly when you go to small villages apart and a bit remote in developing countries, it is just a matter of watching out for our valuable things; actually, and being myself a Peruvian who knows about it, you can feel as safe here as in almost any other part of the world.
This documentary is not about crazy surf manouvers accompanied with crazy hardcore adrenaline-fuelled music; it is a DVD, done with the right feeling, about a part of Per: its coast, its surfing cultural history, the feeling and savvy of this group of north americans and peruvians when hitting its sea with joy and with great manouvers of course, and even going to experience the karma of the ancient incas culture in the highlands. This ultimately becomes a proof of the excellent work of the producers and editors of this DVD documentary. And, of course, the excellent music there, too. Thumbs up for it.
To complement this review, let me just add that Per has all kinds of sea waves (I would also like to add Ecuador here, being the Pacific Ocean coastline along all both Ecuador and Per some of the best for simultaneously relaxing and surfing in America), from 2-ft to 25-ft waves (thus making it also a great place for big wave riders), and for anyone coming to the coast here at anytime of the year, they will always be welcome by consistent beautiful waves and by their people, all of which I am sure will contribute in making them get a unique sporting, cultural and relaxing experience out of this place.",1198713600,,2333,4.706601466992665
2620405,5,B000GY729C,A profound surf journey along the coastline of Peru that inspires the adventurer in all of us.,1189728000,,94,4.588235294117647
2620406,5,B000GY729C,"I am not a surfer, and I've never really been interested in surfing... but my boyfriend grew up in Hawaii and loves it. So he introduced me to this film. Not only is it very artistic, it's also a really beautiful journey through a really amazing place: Peru. The music is awesome, the film is thoughtful, and the passion of each surfer completely resonates. The whole documentary has this kind of calmness to it. It captures the wonder and also sometimes the desolateness that exists in Peru. And the whole film itself is very relaxing somehow. It's more about Peru than surfing.

And girls: the surfers are also really hot.",1183248000,7,624,4.672727272727273
2620407,5,B000GY729C,"Having been born and raised in Per and surfed since 1966, I have watched and read everyting that is about surfing in Per. This film is great, cinematography and the surfing was awsome. Listen to what Magoo de la Rosa says, you will lern about our surfing culture. I was also happy to see that these surfers also went to visit Machu Pichu, they did what all surfer's should do. Not only does Per have waves every day of the year (never a flat day)all through the coast line, but it is rich in culture.

The surf community loves to show off our country, so surfers are always welcomed.",1160611200,13,583,4.348623853211009
2620408,5,B000GY729C,Just watched it for the first time and now I have to watch it again just to catch a better look at the shots! Great cinematography and great music. Only thing I found that I didn't like was the closing credits. They are a bit blurry and I had to freeze frame them to read the song credits. I loved the song 'Sweet and Lonely' and was able to find find it on the net at I-tunes under Nathan Paine. Time to go check out some of the other artists who's tunes are in this movie. If you surf or just dig great surfers doing what they do best just buy it....,1158710400,7,552,3.9375
2620409,2,B000GY729C,"Great scenery and locations, but lacks any real depth. Giving the locations and cultures more attention would elevate this into a better class of surf documentary..",1454198400,,164,5.346153846153846

2620420,4,B000GY729C,Nice mix of a documentary: surfing and traveling through Peru. Beautiful scenery. Real comments. Amazing music in the background. I was in awe of the surfing and humility & hospitality of the Peruvians. I was crushed to find out that there was no official soundtrack; found most of the sounds individually but not all.,1428105600,2,318,4.907407407407407

2620426,1,B000GY729C,"It is terrible! This documentary does not show the real culture of surfers in Peru... the best part is only when the Peruvian surfers talk about their experiences. They only show very horrible shots of Lima and the small towns along the coast of Peru and I know that they have very beautiful places to stay and eat. It is obvious that they did not invest much in the production of the film.  This was like a home-made video of the American surfers featured in the documentary and their vacation in Peru.  It did show good places to surf and that it is not crowded along the coast so it is easy to find great places to surf without the beaches being overcrowded.  But the other shots of Peru only showed poor people and the shanty towns they live in.  Those do exist.  But Peru has a lot of beautiful scenery and nice places to stay and good restaurants.  They didn't show anything of Lima except the Waikiki Club.  Lima is a large, metropolitan city with a lot of old historical buildings.  It's a great place to visit.  In the summer there are a lot of surfers along the beaches of Lima.  This film only presented a few interviews with star Peruvian surfers.  It did not present the culture of average Peruvians who enjoy surfing as a hobby and love the beach there.",1368316800,2,1267,4.394849785407725
2620427,2,B000GY729C,The movie is so boring me too much even I was slept.  I thought they were actors but I was wrong.  They talked about surf on the beaches of Peru. Do not buy it.,1331424000,,160,3.676470588235294

8135010,2,B000GY729C,"I could not get over the comments about the ""shady""and ""sketchy"" locals that wanted to rob them and the desert being referred to a ""desolate wasteland.""  This movie presents the Peruvian people as violent untrustworthy thieves, it is full of culturally insensitive remarks about the locals by privileged white dudes.  There are other surf movies to spend your money on.",1495929600,,369,5.133333333333334
8135011,3,B000GY729C,"It was good for a surf documentary, showing the journey to little known regions, the ""goose chase' to find a legendary wave, some local culture, good rides, but a bit too much bloody bullfight,  the torture and death of a majestic creature. I do not watch surf movies to see this type of animal abuse.",1483833600,,301,4.472727272727273
