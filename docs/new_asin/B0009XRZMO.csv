8070257,4,B0009XRZMO,"Delon defines cool as a cop hunting down super-psycho gangster Trintignant in post-war Paris.  You don't get the thrilling cinematic high of a Melville picture in this largely set-bound but colorful production, but it's fun and Delon is riveting.  (JTL on the other hand, is such a humourless, dead-eyed, whack-job it's hard to see how he could come to lead a criminal gang that's this loyal to him.)  The tense restaurant climax is terrific.  (And note how the denouement resembles American Gangster.)",1220054400,3,502,5.085365853658536
8070258,3,B0009XRZMO,"Flic Story is an uninspired but serviceable period thriller with Alain Delon's honest cop tracking down Jean-Louis Trintignant's psychotic killer in post-war France. The true story is better than the execution, which mixes good but sparing location work with a lot of studio interiors to not always seamless effect, but it's only in the last couple of far too brief scenes where Delon and Trintignant's characters get to know each other that the film really shows what it could have been.

The letterboxed transfer is more than acceptable but less than outstanding, while the extras consist of brief stills gallery, trailer and unsubtitled trailers for 9 other Delon titles - The Sicilian Clan, Borsalino and Co, Two Men in Town, Mort d'un Pourri, Trois Hommes a Abbatre, Pour la Peau d'un Flic, Le Battant, Parole de Flic and Ne Reveilles pas un Flic Qui Dort.",1141516800,,861,4.937931034482759
