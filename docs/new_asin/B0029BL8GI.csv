3876453,3,B0029BL8GI,"MEET THE PEOPLE stars Lucille Ball and Dick Powell, and it's assumed that a pairing like that is a shoe-in for a good time at the movies. MEET THE PEOPLE instead is a mediocre 1944 musical comedy. This was Powell's final musical before the aging matine idol shifted genres and finally landed those dramatic roles. See, later in 1944, he'd dip his toe in film noir with the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-My-Sweet/dp/B000244EX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder, My Sweet</a>. MURDER, MY SWEET successfully reinvented Powell's image from crooner to world-weary tough guy. And while he would still occasionally dabble in lighthearted cinema in later years, he would never look back.

The plot is thin. A war drive in Morganville, Delaware wins shipyard riveter William ""Swanny"" Swanson (Powell) a date with Broadway star Julie Hampton (Ball). Except that Swanny isn't at all on the make; no, he's got his eye on the bigger picture. Swanny has written a stage play that celebrates the common folk, and he wants Julie to help him get it produced. Julie, by this time, is smitten and she pulls strings and gets financial backing for the show. She means to star in it. And when Swanny, unhappy with the garish spin put on his play, challenges Julie that ""to play the people, you have to meet the people,"" she signs on as a lady welder at his shipyard in Morganville. Not too long before the press gets wind of this.

For once I found myself not liking a Powell character much. Swanny Swanson comes off as insufferable, pretty full of himself. He's too judgmental about Julie, doubting her sincerity and effort, even though she's doing her very best to please him. So, yeah, there's that. The script doesn't really allow Lucille Ball to shine, although she's immediately likable. The songs are mostly forgettable, although a June Allyson sighting has her singing ""I'd Like to Recognize the Tune."" The best (and most droll and catchy) tune isn't sung by Powell. No, the best song belongs to the deadpan Virginia O'Brien who warbles out ""Say That We're Sweethearts Again."" I don't think she changed expression one bit during that song.

Mostly, MEET THE PEOPLE is a rah-rah musical revue, its flimsy plot just an excuse to trot out a succession of tedious musical numbers and novelty acts (although, okay, the acrobat girl was pretty d0pe). Meanwhile, I loved Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, but I think that's all I've ever loved him in. I don't love his leaden humor here. 2.5 out of 5 stars for MEET THE PEOPLE. Powell picked the perfect time to jump ship from the musical genre. Or, actually, he was one musical too late.",1352073600,4,2675,4.97986577181208
3876454,4,B0029BL8GI,"As a film, you can see it was made to promote war bonds and give The Boys Over There something to laugh at, but as a film it is one of the little curiosities in the MGM Library. First of all Dick Powell looks too old for the  and smilepart and Lucille Ball is too pretty to disguise as a welder. Bert Lahr is thrown in for laughs and even disappears from the last quarter of the film. MGM stars,including June Allyson, Virginia O'Brien, Rags Ragland, and the orchestras of Spike Jones and Vaughn Monroe add to the star-studded look that only MGM could do.
In 1941 there was a stage revue with the same title, which Metro thought enough of to buy, but all that seems to be left is the title and title song.
For one's collection, since it's one of thos 'oddities', I would say it's a must.
My only conmplaint is with these films the Warner Archives is putting out - there are no extras on most of them, and some of them won't play properly in older machines.",1339459200,5,956,4.224043715846994

This movie has some sensational music in it, great arrangements & great singing, especially one of the greatest songs written by one of the greatest songwriting teams: A gorgeous rendition of one of the most complex, intelligent & downright beautiful pop songs ever written or performed - Rogers & Hart's ""I Like to Recognize the Tune"" (& then there's Spike Jones).",1252972800,,413,5.0

8357681,3,B0029BL8GI,"I was really hoping to like this one since the cast is loaded with favorites, but the story is pretty shoddy.  There are a couple nice musical numbers but the best are saved for the supporting cast.  O'Brien the classic deadpan singer gets a great number where she actually has some emotion and Lahr gets a nice number too, but the film never really gels and Lucy fails mostly in the lead.",1423180800,,389,4.388888888888889

8357686,1,B0029BL8GI,It`s films  like this that give musicals a bad name.  I can`t understand why Bert Larr or Virginia O`brien were in so many films they really turn me off. The only exception for Larr was in Wizard of Oz.  I don`t think there was a memorable song in the film.  My advice: skip this one.,1352505600,,284,4.109090909090909
