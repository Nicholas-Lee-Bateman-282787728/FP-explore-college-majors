8225407,1,B000WS724W,"I guess I was fooled in buying this movie by the other reviews (wrote by the people involved in the making of this joke, I realize this now)...
Another amateurish piece of trash, posing in some kind of ""work of art"". Give me a break...Don't be fooled by the reviews advertising this as being ""a work of art"" because IT IS NOT. Don't waste your time with this...",1245888000,,361,4.323529411764706
8225408,5,B000WS724W,"Randy Greif created something that could easily become a cult classic.  Very surrealistic... has many layers that go way beyond today's studio releases.

I don't want to repeat too much of the other reviews, but the content is definitely not for children, prudes, or the squeemish.  Also, you'll want to watch it a few times to fully appreciate it's intricacies.  There are alot of quick glimses of cool shots that help fill in the story.

It's pretty freaky...  but in very cool way.",1194825600,2,484,4.771084337349397
8225409,5,B000WS724W,"There are very few films being released nowadays that qualify as an ART FILM.  Enter 3 trials- at long last, it's the real deal, a geniune artistic piece from start to finish.  This is a great movie and a great one to own.  Like a music recording, it can be viewed over and over again.  It has a plot, but is not plot driven.  It is a geniune time honored ART film, an exciting debute from Randy Grief, for people who miss the Genre- as ART FILMS seemed to have ceased to exist sometime ago.

For a (I imagine) low budget, it has some of the best cinematography this side of A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT.  The music, however, is what gets the film repeated plays in my home.  I love the true industrial music, not the commercial crap of 9 inch nails that they play on KROQ, but the real deal- an assembly of the best groups of the form are all here, SPK, Controlled bleeding, nurse with wound,muslimgauze, Rapoon and Grief himself.  I imagine a soundtrack CD will be realeased too, to compliment the film, but for now, you can just let the film play and you have some of the most beautiful music and cinematic images in the 00's.  I can't think of any film that encorporates music as wonderfully as this.

This movie is not for the kids and not for the squeemish.  It's got a little porn, altho, the sex is celebrated and performed in a unique way.  It is very sexy, tho, as new comer Molinee Green is not only hot but a skilled actress.  None of the actors ""Act,"" per se- the style is realistic so you don't have actors spitting back LINES.  I couldn't tell if the dialouge scenes were improvised or scripted.  For a cast of unknowns (unless I'm mistaken- I did see Thomas Crnkovitch of HBO'S DEADWOOD in there) they all look real good and the acting is refreshingly real.

It's worth the dough.  It's an original piece that you can put on when friends come over, just having it on is cool as for the most part it is non linear.  You can jump in anywhere and enjoy it for it's complex cinematography, witty dialouge or steamy sex.  It is also hilarious.  The DVD is hours of fun with a huge bag of extras and deleted scenes.  I bought two, one for each TV in the house, so they can play simultaneously.  It's very trippy.",1194739200,3,2216,4.286746987951807
8225410,5,B000WS724W,"I recommend the purchase of this DVD.  It was a very thought provoking independent film by Randy Greif.  An excellent performace by Mollinee Green as the wife of a Surgeon (Max Herholz)  I enjoyed Michael Schmidt's character which is featured in a supporting role.  The images, as the main character Green travels between fantasy and reality, created by Director Randy Greif are both vivid as well as strong.  It would not be a film for childern under 18 due to some of its R rated content.  Again, my hat is off to Randy Greif and the cast of the Three Trials.
Thanks Mike in Northern California.  11/06/07",1194307200,2,607,4.616822429906542
