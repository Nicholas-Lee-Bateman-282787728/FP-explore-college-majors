8073913,5,B000A3E8KK,"With 82 years and exiled in Burdeos Francisco Goya tells to his daughter Rosario the vicissitudes of his life: a life marked by the illustrated Spain of king Carlos III, the invasion of Spain by Napoleon, the corrupted kingdom of Fernando VII, political intrigues and the murder of his lover Cayetana, duquesa de Alba.

"" Goya en Burdeos "" is so a personal and very beautiful homage to the genial spanish painter as a perfect synthesis of Saura's career as filmmaker and artist; so a film scrupulously documented as a creative recreation and profound reflection about Goya's work and life. The structure of the movie is intrincate and fluid, and also emblematic of Saura's last film works: a game of mirrors, ebbs and flows where Goya's paintings and motives; imagination, dreams and nightmares; memory and reality form an organic system of communicant vessels. All this and the artifice of to be an old Goya who refers us his life allows Saura to ""touch"" all the retrospective scenes of the film, dark dreams and disturbing imaginations of Goya with the light, colour and motives of his paintings, matter in which takes an important part the excellent photography work of Vittorio Storaro. In this sense, both artists, Saura and Storaro, go a step beyond than in his previous and magnificient collaboration together ( this is, "" Tango "" ) in using colour and light to create transitions and narrative jumps in time and space. Unforgettable are, for other part , the recreations with actors ( catalonian avantgardist theatre group "" La fura dels baus "" collaborates in some of them ) of some famous Goya's pictures, as if they were paintings turned into life. The film is beautifully closed, with a circular movement, over the birth of Goya: it's snowing outside and the image gradually dilutes until the colour white occupies all the screen, this is, like if the screen was a not used linen. Seconds after we read Andre Malraux's famous words: "" With Goya begins modern painting ""

But - as it have been said above- "" Goya in Burdeos"" is also a synthesis of all Saura's previous film work: we find in it the political commentary and allegoric language characteristic of his firsts films; a reformulation of the coreographies and formal experiments we find in his more recent musical ones; plastic invention inspired in barroque painters; metalinguistic games; the use of light and colour in a conceptual and narrative way; the anticlerical satire; metaphisic arguments and a labyrinthic narrative structure.

In short, ""Goya en Burdeos"" is an astounding and very personal experience of cinematographic and plastic invention inspired in the work of one of the most influential and genial painters of all time, and until today the most profound and passionate homage that someone has dedicated to Francisco Goya. But this review wouldn't be complete if we forget to mention that "" Goya in Burdeos "" is also the artistic testimony of another man who has gone a step forward of his time ( and, may be not accidentally, from Aragon too... )
