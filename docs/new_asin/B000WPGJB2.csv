8224800,3,B000WPGJB2,"I've been delving deeper into my Irish roots after visiting Ireland last August, especially the troubles of Northern Ireland. There are two great books I can recommend, Proved Innocent and Error of Judgment, which address bombings in the UK by the IRA. In both cases confessions were beaten out of people who weren't guilty. This movie is based on the second series of bombs and by today's standards of movie making this one seems pretty contrived. I suppose if I was seeing it in 1976 when it was first released I might have been more impressed. If you want better knowledge about the subject the books are better.",1447027200,,615,4.703703703703703
8224801,4,B000WPGJB2,"a stellar cast,I had to get this movie because I'm a huge fan of Martin Shaw - it dragged on a bit for a while,but a good story nonetheless",1394409600,,139,3.8275862068965516
8224802,4,B000WPGJB2,"Very intelligent, thoughtful re-telling of the true story of six men
who where put away in the UK for a bombing in Ireland they had nothing
to do with, and how journalists finally got the case re-examined.

This reminded me in tone of a low budget 'All the President's Men', the
focus being not on the men imprisoned, nor the real culprits, but on
the slow, difficult uphill climb journalists faced in putting together
the facts, with the police, politicians and even the courts standing in
their way.

While a very good film, it somehow lacked the power of the classic
""President's Men"". Sometimes these recreations felt a little more
theatrical, the acting a bit more self-conscious, the bad guys a bit
moustache twirling. And John Hurt's character as the main investigative
force felt a bit one note in his dogged approach. Not the fault of this
very fine actor, who brings as much life to the character as possible,
but seemingly the script, which has a few too many scenes of Hurt in a
room with someone, pressing them for details in a similar way. I would
guess real life journalists have to vary their tactics more depending
on the situation.

But carping aside, this is another in the body of solid films that
investigate what can happen when police and politics decide it's more
important to convict someone, then to convict the right one.",1325376000,,1348,4.703389830508475
8224803,4,B000WPGJB2,"This arrived much quicker than I expected, which was good.  It's basically a docu-drama about the convicted bombers of Birmingham UK, and really makes you question whether they really are the bombers.",1296777600,,200,5.25
8224804,2,B000WPGJB2,"I've been a long time student of the Troubles, and I'm well acquainted with the case of the Birmingham Six, and I think they and the British people owe Chris Mullin a great deal for exposing the wrongful conviction of the Six for the worst case of mass murder on British soil before Lockerbie (which amounts to a huge miscarriage of justice itself given the Scottish Government's indefensible release of one of the bombers after serving just eight years of a supposed minimum of 27 on ""compassionate"" grounds).

Unfortunately, I can't recommend ""Who Bombed Birmingham?""  The problem with it is that the story jumps around so much and so quickly (from 1974 to 1985 and back again), the dual narratives (the arrest, torture, and conviction of the Six in 1974 and the journalists uncovering it all in 1985) are never given any time to build momentum or make us care about either the wrongfully convicted men or the campaigning journalists.

So the movie was disappointment for me, but I can definitely recommend another movie about a similar miscarriage of justice ""In the Name of the Father.""  It deals with another infamous set of IRA pub bombings and accompanying miscarriages of justice (the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven), has a much higher powered cast, better script, and production values.  I actually saw it in Belfast and I remember one native of Northern Ireland (aka ""the North of Ireland"") commenting that the riot scene in the movie was so realistic, he thought he was going to get hit by a brick flying out of the screen.

So I'd recommend that movie and not this one.",1251417600,2,1751,5.1879432624113475
8224805,2,B000WPGJB2,Didn't translate well to the screen. Interesting topic to some (me) would have been better served in a short book or part of a larger work on British corruption/frustration during the recent troubles.,1227484800,,200,5.090909090909091
8224806,4,B000WPGJB2,"Who Bombed Birmingham focuses on the true events that involved the 1974 IRA bombing of two different Pubs in Birmingham, England that killed 21 and injured 162 others.  Following the outcome of the bombings, six Irish men were wrongly convicted of the crimes.

The story presented here is a meticulous re-creation, examination, and investigation of the different elements of the crime by three journalists from a current affairs television program attempting to set the record straight about what the facts really were and who the real suspects might have been.

Discovery of forced confessions through police brutality and other questionable techniques along with the fact that Britain's judicial system failed to acknowledge the illegality of these incidents went a long way in revealing many doubts about the official version of how the suspects were convicted.

The culmination of the investigation with all the new facts at hand along with an appeal to the courts by the wrongly convicted six men, unfortunately, did not sway the British judicial system and they all remain in prison to this day.  Subsequent investigations by the journalists eventually revealed the identities of five actual IRA suspects that carried out the bombings.

Although the pace of this film moved slower than I expected it to, it was worth the wait because I found the story to be quite interesting and intriguing.  My chief complaint with the movie was the fact that the audio itself was substandard overall.  Changes in volume at different times coupled with the British accents throughout the entire dialogue sometimes made it difficult to hear and understand everything being said.  This did not totally detract from the viewing experience but it did lessen the appeal a little bit.  Unfortunately, there was no option on the disc for subtitles.  Apart from that, I was pleased nonetheless and I would recommend this film to anyone who likes stories based on true crime events of any kind.",1226534400,3,1976,5.1246105919003115
