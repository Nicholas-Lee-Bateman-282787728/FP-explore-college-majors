2245624,4,B0007V6IVM,"I bought the first season DVD set and have been thoroughly enjoying the show.  The final bikes look fantastic and really give you the urge to get a custom chopper of your own.  When you watch the 9/11 Fire Fighters tribute bike being put together, and see how everyone gets so personally involved, you can't help but feel a bit moved by the unveiling.

Two minor gripes with the series.

The first is that all you really see of bike building is Paul Jr fabricating bits and pieces from sheet metal and bolting them to the bike.  Don't get me wrong, the guy's vision is amazing, but they send out for most things including painting and custom framework.  You get to see snapshots of an engine being lifted into the frame, or a wheel having the axle put through it, but if you are expecting pointers on how to really put a custom chopper together (installing engine, electricals, etc) then you will need to look elsewhere.

The other thing is the famous/infamous Paul Sr V's Paul Jr shouting matches that take up a good 1/4 of each episode.  You have to real feel for the other guys in the shop as it must be embarrassing as hell.  If you enjoy watching people screaming at each other in a dysfunctional fashion then you will enjoy it.  For me when they start going at it I just hit fast forward on the remote, once the arms stop waving around I resume playback and enjoy see the bike taking shape.

All in all for a ""reality show"" it is a very enjoyable series and I will be buying Series 2 very soon.",1117411200,17,1826,4.395833333333333
2245625,4,B0007V6IVM,"As another reviewer pointed out, there are missing episodes & some footage.  The episodes ""Jet Bike"" & ""Biketober"" are not included.  If you want these, prepare to shell out more $$$ + s/h from discoverychannel. com to get them.",1117411200,21,228,4.82051282051282
2245626,4,B0007V6IVM,"As someone who grew up in an environment of a family owned business, I thoroughly enjoy the ranting and raving of the guys of OCC. This is funny stuff.",1116633600,4,151,4.241379310344827
2245627,5,B0007V6IVM,"I've watched this show from the beginning and can't get enough of it.  I think it might be because they are just blue collared american workers just like you and I.  There is one thing I noticed on one episode.  When they build the race car bike, the 2nd part, all footage toward the end what taken off.  I remember watching it on tv with them going to the race track and watching the race car drive for trim spa ""chase"" at the time race in the daytona 500.  All that footage is not on the dvd.  Also it doesn't include the 2 pilot episodes with the ""jet bike"", and also ""the cody project""  Also missing the christmas bike episode but I don't remember what season it went with anyway.  Other than that I would highly recommend it!",1116288000,2,730,4.239130434782608
2245628,5,B0007V6IVM,"I am going to first start off by writing the fact that when I started watching this show a few years back that I was in no way intrested in metal fabrication or motorcycles for that matter.  Now I own my own 78 harley which I have modified heavily for fun, so to anyone (yea im talking to you CDI grizzly) who says that these guys are chumps and don't know what they are doing maybe you should talk to the couple million bikers who actually work, build and ride creations inspired by this show,  truly amazing what this show has done for so many people.

The show is quite honestly a perfect example of commentary, display and final showoff of creations that are made.  You find out what it takes to actually make something from ground up, add to that this show is hilarious with the dad and mikey.  Add to that all the guys that work there are amazing guys.

So in conclusion this show is amazing and now that you can get the entire first 2 seasons for 25 bucks a piece is a no brainer for anyone who remotely enjoys motorcycles or creation shows.",1115596800,3,1048,4.267676767676767
2245629,2,B0007V6IVM,"Speaking on the authority of a REAL Biker who has LIVED the Lifestyle for over 35 of my almost 53 years, during which I have ridden the same '63 Harley Panhead, (which I built and rebuilt from the ground up with my own two hands), longer than the Turtle Kids have been alive, My Brothers and I all find Orange County Chumps to be some of the Funniest Comedy on DVD! Their Ol'Man is one of the greatest comedians to try and call himself a ""biker""; seemingly, the only thing that HE works at is running his MOUTH! What little I have been able to watch of this show without developing acute nausea, I have NEVER seen Turtle, Sr. EVER pick up a tool or lend a hand to help anyone at ANYTHING.
The bikes built by OCC may have some eye appeal, but are otherwise a waste of parts & labor, as they are totally unridable; you would need an entire parking lot to turn one of them around, and the spider bike in particular, with its ridiculous rear fender, would give you a radical shower if one attempted to ride it on wet pavement, much less in the rain!(And I would LOVE to know what company sells them INSURANCE!)
My Brothers and I have long debated which is more hilarious, the Turtles, with their hour long screaming matches, or the sidewalk commandos who give the mighty OCC free advertising, running around with T-shirts & other gear, none of whom OWN, or probably even KNOW HOW to ride a MOTORCYCLE! Only Hang-arounds and Wannabees worship these comedians; REAL Bikers only LAUGH at them! The only reason this gets two stars is the LAUGH Factor!
 As far as other reviewers who are so critical of my well earned opinion are concerned, just read their other reviews (if they have any)!
At least Jesse James RIDES his creations to shows! The Turtles TRAILER Theirs (and then have to FLY IN their mechanics when one of their monstrosities breaks down!) JESSE may be terminally commercial, but at least he's HONEST!",1115596800,,1908,4.482758620689655
2245630,5,B0007V6IVM,"I have been a fan of the show on Discovery Channel. Late night, I work all night long on my web site for Horse Racing fans, and its a grind getting all the info typed in before daylight arrives.

One of the more enjoyable shows on Discovery helps me get through those long nights, its American Chopper.

Right away, you realize that this is a show about much more then just building hot bikes. The bikes are hot, and the talent displayed by Paul, jr and family is very impressive.

This show gives you the human side of the Teutul family. I have to say the greatest aspect of American Chopper is that you feel you are watching real people, not paid actors, and it makes all the difference in the world.

Paul jr's commentary is so honest. He is not being pretneous in any way, and when people make mistakes, they admit to them, and the show moves on. Our day to day life is filled with people being hammered for making any mistakes in their work, and its very refreshing to see the guys move forward and work as a team if any problems arise with the building of these very complicated bikes.

In a way, you almost feel like you are invited to be part of the family as you watch the family interaction between Paul, Paul jr, Mike and Vinny.

I really like the Teutul's and the show, and would encourage people to buy the DVD's. Its a refreshing idea for a TV Show, and it really holds your interest through each episode.

On my web site, I say ""The Stick Rules""

For this show, you have to say...""The Teutul's Rule !""

It takes an artist, and a skilled craftsman and an amazing business sense to create, design and fabricate the one of a kind bikes you see on the show. This family seems to have all those talents wrapped up in the talented people they surround themselves with.

G-d bless,

2245632,1,B0007V6IVM,"Why are the American Chopper/OCC DVD, complete season sets being piece mealed, and for the most part, overpriced.  Is it greed from the Teutul's , Discovery or others.

Although the season doesn't include the Pilot episodes (Jet Bike & Biketober) neither the Mickey special, it contains the first 13 episodes of Season One. It includes main menu, episode selection and special features. Unfortunately for people interesting in other languages, it does NOT include any subtitles(spanish,french,...), but it includes closed captions.

2245646,3,B0007V6IVM,"I really like this show. And since I didn't start watching it untill the middle of the third season, I bought the DVD. However, upon consideration. I may buy all of the seasons offered since shows made for the Discovery Channel are unlikely to show up in syndicaton on some other network.",1143244800,2,288,4.5576923076923075
2245647,4,B0007V6IVM,"What can I say, I am addicted!  The personalities of Paul Sr and Paul Jr and son, Mickey, along with their valuable employees (Vinnie, Rick, etc.) is quite entertaining.  Not only do they build ""dream"" bikes, but it's fun to get a glimpse of a successful business and its daily operation and the adulation that it has brought them.  An American Dream, that's what it is.  As an owner of a small business myself, I wish I could get away with yelling at my daughter, the way Sr yells at Jr, and not have her talk back to me in a disrespectful way.  Hats off to Jr......if you love motorcycles, buy this series, fun fun fun!",1138665600,2,621,4.318965517241379
