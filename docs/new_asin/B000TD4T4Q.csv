8208631,5,B000TD4T4Q,This is a great DVD that clearly shows the Round Peak clawhammer style and songs. Mr. Carlin is a relaxed master and presents the songs in an easily understood manner. This DVD helped make connections between what I was hearing on clawhammer CD's and helped me transition into making my own arrangements of songs in this style. Highly recomended!,1381104000,,346,4.88135593220339
8208632,5,B000TD4T4Q,"I love this DVD.  It is like 6 months of lessons with a really good, really patient teacher...except better because you can use it any time of day or night for as long or as little as you want.

I recommend skipping the first tune and coming back to it if you are a relative beginner, because Bob makes an error in what he says he's doing that can be disorienting unless you're experienced enough to pick up on it. However, in general I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  I love the style of banjo that is being taught here, and Bob does a great job teaching it. The DVD does also include a tab sheet for extra reference if you get confused.

On this DVD, Bob teaches:
-Ducks on the Millpond
-Solider's Joy from Kyle Creed
-Rockingham Cindy
-John Henry
-John Brown's Dream from Tommy Jarrell
-Sugar Hill
-Round Town Gals
-Train 45 from Fred Cockerham
-Tater Patch from Charlie Lowe",1219017600,6,892,4.387878787878788
