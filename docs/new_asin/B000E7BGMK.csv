Yes I could go into deeply analytical critical reviewing but why kill a good time.  ""That's the guy we framed!""--""you're a lucky man."". And there it is SO THERE.",1440547200,,297,3.9
8106896,3,B000E7BGMK,"The routine, parsimonious second feature made as such, originally a training academy for aspirant directors, was almost wholly obsolete by 1959, and this very tired rehash of familiar tropes (doomed airliner, panicked semistellar passengers, substitute pilot) is more interesting for its credits and piquant cast list than what actually hits the screen. It's one of the last gasps in a dying genre replaced by pernicious television, and the auteur extended his career in that voracious medium while the very creative producer wisely retired. The onscreen talent--all clearly enervated by the Mexico City altitude--include Guy Madison, George Raft and George Macready, and the diverse second-tier female actors are Virginia Mayo, Ilona Massey (her film swan song), Margaret Lindsay, Anna Lee and her comely starlet daughter Venetia Stevenson, all in career doldrums and willing to work inexpensively. Lee is reliably elegant, La Massey rather  animated as a conceited diva, and Mayo very professional, leggy and extremely fetching in Madrileno cabaret costume in the film's pseudonoir prologue. Madison, Mayo and the shady Raft collaborate as substitute pilots for a bumpy Idlewild landing, and for once we're not asked to believe that Doris Day or Karen Black did it all, sweaty-palmed and piloting the turboprop solo. The director and producer respect their experienced captive audience, although the script is impossible and Louis Forbes' score is simply a bald inversion of Tiomkin's famously tiresome ""High and the mighty"" theme. (The King Sisters quaintly swing their Forbes song ""What would I do without you?"" as jukebox underscoring in a quickie flashback, but the film lacks any Mayo-Raft ballroom dancing that might have made it special, as in the spectacular Raft-Jerry Lewis tango in LADIES MAN.)

The director is Byron Haskin (1899-1984). Born in Portland, he survived the San Francisco earthquake and in Hollywood was a distinguished DP and SFX specialist in collaboration with George Pal. His signature films came in the 1950s, with WAR OF THE WORLDS and Charlton Heston and Eleanor Parker menaced by killer ants in NAKED JUNGLE. With Haskin what you see onscreen is what you get (he was a great visual artist), and he's a likeable and solid director who doesn't take himself too seriously, although his craftsmanship is painstaking.

Even more interesting is the colorful indie producer Benedict Bogeaus (1904-68), whose personal imprint is all over this film, his last. An entrepreneurial and artistic godfather to Roger Corman, Ben came from Chicago where he manufactured zippers and radios, then quite logically to Hollywood where he was a very resourceful indie producer from 1940 on. He notably collaborated at RKO with the great pioneer Allan Dwan for the Canadian's late masterworks SILVER LODE, TENNESSEE'S PARTNER and the incredible color noir SLIGHTLY SCARLET. Virginia Mayo had worked happily with both Bogeaus and Dwan, and her presence here--she's certainly the best thing about the film--provides continuity with their barebones indie tradition in maverick filmmaking. Symbolically, Mayo in this unremarkable film (alongside her elder Warners colleagues Lindsay and Raft) is a living link between the tyrannical studio system and the newer, looser and more tenuous milieu of independently financed production that still defines Hollywood's business day.",1431216000,,3382,5.487523992322457
