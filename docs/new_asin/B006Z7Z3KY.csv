5038463,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I pre-ordered this because never before has there ever been a daytime serial that's been released in its entirety in one complete box set.  I've been meaning to watch ""Dark Shadows"" and ""get into it,"" but the high price of each DVD set has deterred me from doing so.  I think the suggested retail price is fair and I'll always have the set ""around"" so that when I am ready to start watching from the beginning it'll be there.  No doubt this box set will go for an extremely high price one day when it eventually goes out of print. I'd like to save myself the headache and buy it now.",1327104000,30,583,4.2342342342342345
5038464,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"The following review is dedicated to my favorite actor of all-time, Jonathan Frid who passed away peacefully in his native Canada on April 14, 2012. We will miss you Mr. Frid, but thankfully we have your years of work on DVD for posterity to remember you by. God bless you ""Barnabas"".

With the release film version of the 1960's cult classic daytime soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" starring Johnny Depp MPI Home Video has released ""Dark Shadows-The Complete DVD Collection""! This has made all of us ""Dark Shadows"" fans extremely happy, especially those of us that haven't yet purchased any DVD sets of the series. All 1225 episodes from the ABC network daytime run (1966-1971) are available along with a slew of bonuses including interviews with series creator Dan Curtis and various stars of the soap.

 Luckily for the show's fans all episodes of this soap opera exist except one (#1219) which is the ""lost show"" episode. However, the audio of that episode has been found by a collector and the studio has been able to recreate the episode using that audio and various still pictures. The fact that most soap operas had their episodes destroyed prior to 1979 and that all the shows of ""Dark Shadows"" exist is really a miracle as networks were proned to wiping soaps and daytime game shows as they felt no one would want to watch them again after their first airing, and also because videotape (which is the way ""Dark Shadows"" was produced) was very costly during the sixties.

 The price for this beautiful box set is in the range of $400.00-$600.00, but when you consider what your getting it is a remarkable deal. The shows have been cleaned from their prints and look as if they were produced yesterday. Also, ""Dark Shadows"" has been released several times on DVD in various box sets that were nearly $60.00 per set and there were 32 sets to purchase so when you take all this into account the ""Limited Edition"" or ""Deluxe Edition"" is a collector's dream! If you had to purchase each one of the ""collector's sets"" individually the final price tag would be $2000.00 for all 1225 shows so again this is a fantastic price!

 It is important to note as well that on the original individual box set that featured episode #451 a very popular ""blooper"" was omitted. The blooper featured an actress playing an old witch who went up on her line. You then could hear someone off camera telling her what the line was. In this ""Complete Collection"" set that blooper is being restored!

 Also the first episode to feature Barnabas from 1967 was an old kinescope that was grainy and rough to view which was put on the original DVD set. Eventually on the last DVD set of ""Dark Shadows"" (from the ""In the Beginning"" series) a better copy of that episode was found, restored and included as a bonus. In this ""new"" set both the rough copy and the remastered version are being included.

 Many have wondered if the two ""Dark Shadows"" feature films, 1970's ""House of Dark Shadows"" and 1971's ""Night of Dark Shadows"", would be included here and unfortunately the answer is no. Those films are not owned by MPI, but by Warner Brothers who have stated that both movies will be released on DVD and Blu Ray sometime later in 2012.

 MPI has also announced that it is rereleasing all 32 individual box sets of ""Dark Shadows"" on April 3, 2012

 UPDATE: MARCH 23, 2012: THE STREET DATE IS INDEED APRIL 10, 2012 WITH SOME ON-LINE RETAILERS ACTUALLY SENDING OUT COPIES TO CUSTOMERS THIS WEEK, TWO FULL WEEKS BEFORE THE SET ARRIVES IN STORES!!!

 The following is a complete list of bonuses provided by MPI Studios and these are splendid:

1. Commemorative large Coffin package (housing 22 amaray cases)
2. A Deluxe Booklet with episode summaries and photographs
3. Special Bloopers, Treasure and Behind-The-Scenes DVD
4. Over 120 Bonus Cast and Crew Video Interviews
5. An Autographed Postcard from Jonathan Frid (Barnabas). This is an actual signed postcard autographed by Jonathan and not a preprint!!! (Thank you Gerard Heaney)
6. Limited Numbered Edition
7. Deluxe High-Quality Packaging (matte and foil coating, nickel hinges and black ribbon to hold lid when opened)
8. Box Dimensions: (Coffin), 13 1/2"" L X 11 1/4"" W (at widest) X 5 3/4"" D
9. Shipping Carton Dimensions, 16.5"" X 8.8"" X 14""
10. Weight (Carton and Contents)-15.5 lbs

 The actual box art comes in the shape of a coffin and is the size of a shoebox. The DVD's themselves are housed in individual plastic cases with the spines looking upward to show the entire body of Barnabas lying asleep in his coffin. Really neat!!! The cases house an amazing 131 DVD's.

 Among the MANY bonuses are the rare Jonathan Frid ""Merv Griffin"" interview from 1969 and Joan Bennett's appearance on ""The Mike Douglas Show"". What is also nice to hear are the original ABC network voice-overs during the credit crawl at the end of the episodes.

 MPI I thank you from the bottom of my vampire heart!!!!

 UPDATE: MARCH 28, 2012: Well folks I almost dropped dead when a man came to my door today as I didn't anticipate getting the set until the street date. I opened this big cardboard box and there lying in all its glory was my beloved ""Dark Shadows""!!! Trust me...everything you've heard about the set is true. As ""Mayday"" explained...""MPI hit it out of the ball park with this one"". This set is everything I dreamed of and more. The packaging is strong, sturdy and almost made out of a combination of cardbord and strong tin. Where the coffin opens there are two hinges made of medal that are tightly screwed to the case. Inside the DVD's themselves are all lined up nicely and safely and are NOT in paper sleeves, but actual strong DVD cases. When I opened my set I was dismayed not to find my collectable booklet, but upon inspection I realized it is put at the very end along where the DVD's themselves are housed. The book is gorgeous with rare black and white pics and all the ABC original airdates and summaries of each show are included. The autograph postcard of Jonathan Frid is indeed authentic and is signed in beautiful red ink.

 I also looked at the bottom of the set and I am #2462 out of 2500. There is a seal that states this is a limited edition and has your number there.

 All in all a beautiful set that has to be seen to be believed.

 UPDATE: MARCH 29th, 2012: O.K. MORE NEWS! MPI HAS BEEN SO IMPRESSED WITH THE HUGE SALES OF THIS COMPLETE SET OF ""DARK SHADOWS"" THAT ON JULY, 10th, 2012 ANOTHER SERIES OF SETS OF ""DARK SHADOWS-THE COMPLETE SERIES"" WILL BECOME AVAILABLE!!! HOWEVER, ON THIS ""NEW"" SET THE DVD""S, THE COLLECTABLE BOOKLET AND THE WONDERFUL PACKAGING OF THE COFFIN WILL REMAIN THE SAME, BUT MISSING WILL BE THE JONATHAN FRID POSTCARD AND THE ""LIMITED #"" ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SET. THE JULY 10th RELEASE WILL BE AN UNLIMITED SET MEANING THOUSANDS WILL BE PRODUCED, NOT JUST THE MERE 2500 THAT WERE MADE. THE REASON TOO FOR THIS DELAY IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE PACKAGING OF THE COFFIN IS DONE OVERSEAS AND IT TAKES TIME FOR THEM TO BE MADE AND SHIPPED TO THE U.S..

 UPDATE: ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 6th, 2012 AMAZON HAS STOPPED TAKING PRE-ORDERS FOR ""THE LIMITED SET"" SIGNALLING THEY HAVE NO MORE FOR SALE, BUT THEY ARE TAKING PRE-ORDERS FOR THE ""DELUXE EDITION"". Also, as of July 20th the Deluxe Edition has already sold signalling the second printing of this delightful box set (even without the Jonathan Frid autographed postcard) is in very high demand by consumers. Way to go ""Dark Shadows"" fans!

 UPDATE: April 13, 2012: As of this date all on-line retailers, including Amazon, have completely sold out the Limited Edition set of ""Dark Shadows"" which means if you were fortunate enough to purchase a copy you are now sitting on a gold mine! Actually, many stores sold out this remarkable collection weeks before the actual street date which was April 10, 2012 including MPI the company that produced the set.

 UPDATE: July 18th, 2012: Warner Brothers has announced that both ""House of Dark Shadows"" and ""Night of Dark Shadows"" will arrive separately on both DVD and Blu-Ray on October 30th, 2012!!!!!

 UPDATE: January 1, 2014. It has been awhile since I last updated this review. Looking at the latest amounts of ""Limited Edition"" copes of ""Dark Shadows-The Complete Original Series"" on Amazon I noticed prices from private sellers are between $1300.00 to $3500.00 U.S. !!! Collectors...take care of those coffins! LOL

5038465,5,B006Z7Z3KY,I absolutely cannot wait for this to be released again because I missed it the first go 'round. I'm just hoping that this time the video is cleaned up a little more.,1327104000,7,165,4.1875
5038492,1,B006Z7Z3KY,"I bought the genuine product from amazon.com themselves in January. It has all of the characteristics of the genuine product, so it's definitely not a fake.  I haven't finished it yet, but so far I have found 4 discs to be faulty in different ways. I'd watched a lot of this series for free but decided to buy it, so I started watching it from disc 97 and then started over from the beginning and have got to disc 26, which has been freezing and then jumping ahead. There was a disc that had loud singing in the background, first a woman, later a man speaking, then a man singing. Then there were two that had the soundtrack playing twice over the top of each other but at different places and farther apart than an echo would be.
I contacted MPI yesterday by their website contact form to ask if they replaced faulty discs, expecting them to say yes, because that's what a company that stands behind their product would do. They replied that if you don't buy it directly from them, they charge $9.98 each plus shipping. When I bought this back in January, it cost me nearly $400 including the tax, and now, unless I find even more faulty discs, which will make it even more money, they want about $40 plus shipping, which will probably also be well over the top of what it really costs them. The discs worked out to about $3 apiece in the original set when I bought it. They not only don't stand behind their product, they rip people off, making them buy replacements of their faulty discs and at ridiculously high prices, which may also be faulty. You don't know that until you buy them and play them. I'm really disgusted..",1522627200,,1626,4.42
5038493,2,B006Z7Z3KY,I opened the package and the coffin case was damaged on one side. The DVD cases and discs were not damaged.,1522281600,,107,4.142857142857143

5038498,4,B006Z7Z3KY,First of all let me say I am loving this box set. This is brought back all the memories that I thought it would. And a beautiful coffin type box DVD package with a picture of Barnabas I have just started watching them but I have one small complaint being as expensive as this is I have no closed captions as of yet. So I'm assuming that the whole set has no closed captions. Being that this is an older print and has been remastered very well I am still hard of hearing. But I will not let that deter my love for this box set I got this on a lightning deal 4 under $300 so I am glad I waited in that pay the five to $600 when it first came out. But that being said it would still be worth it if you're a fan like I was Fork over the cash I just said,1519948800,,749,3.7468354430379747

My collection would not play on my DVD player, and I almost returned it.  However, it played fine on my computer.

Disks were fine, Amazon Customer Service was a great help other than that all is well with purchase. My review is....best of the best, nothing beats the original. I enjoyed every minute of it.

5038549,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Because you will LOVE it even more...  the series, to paraphrase  David Selby, is timeless, a true classic.  Between Barnabas (a name the shows creators picked out of the Bible), Angelique and  Quentin,there is no shortage of gothic entertainment that keeps you anticipating the next episode.  What makes this timeless is, there is no technology, no automobiles, nothing to suggest what year this takes place other than they announce it, and then tell you when they time travel back to the past.  You see no televisions, no meals being prepared.  A lot can be left up to the imagination as the entire show focuses on the actorsand mainly Collinwood, the Old House, and the cemetery.  It was good when I was a kid but to be able to watch as much as I want when I want now -with ALL the DVDs...is my guilty pleasure!!!!  Excellent price for 1200+ shows, bonus interviews and bloopers.

Dont try to get it cheaper elsewhere. I did-and got a bootleg set.  Amazon sells the authentic MPI set.",1515974400,2,987,4.6473988439306355
5038550,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I was a bit skeptical after seeing so many negative reviews, but most are from back in 2011 and 2012. My set was complete, no damage to the carboard case, individual disk cases or any of the dvds. All were in order, none missing, not a mark on any of them. All removed easily eith no cracking and so on. Can't say for sure yet about playing errors, but time will tell. I highly recommended this collection to all DS fans.",1515974400,5,421,4.209876543209877

5038562,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"My husband was SO excited to receive this amazing set for Christmas! We have been binge-watching Dark Shadows since Christmas day, and my children are now hooked on this fun, creepy and supernatural soap opera.

We love pointing out ""Collin-speak,"" when the characters repeat their line. ""I don't like it. I don't like it at all...""

So this set is AMAZING. I have included photos of the packaging and presentation. It was boxed in a custom shipping carton, with custom folded cardboard that held the coffin in place. Then that carton was BUBBLE WRAPPED inside a bigger shipping box. Amazing! No damage at all to the treasure inside...

and the coffin-shaped DVD case, is simply remarkable. The hinges are real metal, and the case is going to hold up nicely for many years. I'm sure my husband will display this set in a prominent place, after he is done viewing all the episodes... and I'm sure he will go through and watch them all again after that.

I have also included some photos of the included booklet, which describes each episode. The last 2 pages of the booklet include a list of all the bonus materials.

We have already had many hours of enjoyment from this series. I highly recommend this to any avid fans of Barnabas Collins, Dark Shadows, or even just someone who loves entertainment that features vampires and the supernatural. The show is campy, creepy and cultish. Each episode begins with a shot of the director's board, and almost all of the episodes were shot in only one take. There are mistakes in the lines, and missed cues, filming and technical errors... all included! It's great fun to watch with the family. We love it!

I was so glad to find this. It was the best Christmas gift he has ever received.",1515024000,10,1730,4.655737704918033

Even if one didn't watch the show when it was on years ago, it's still a lot of fun.  The episodes were taped live, so it's all part of the charm - like going to live theater!  I was a little wary because it's an expensive purchase to make online-unseen, and I knew through research that there are some knock-offs, so I was very happy when this arrived.  This is a great trusted seller.  Shipped very securely and quickly too!",1512259200,4,549,4.44

5038588,1,B006Z7Z3KY,"Sorrybut, one star to warn buyers and current owners about how tight the front and back discs (two on each side) are fastened to their hubs. Nearly every one of these discs now have hairline fractures from me taking them in and out of the cases and Ive noticed them spreading dangerously close towards each discs aluminum layer. No matter how careful I am when removing the discs, more tiny fractures appear and spread. Instead of using the original cases, I am placing the discs into paper CD sleeves to protect them from further damage. I can imagine one snapping in half if I continue using the original cases.

Has anyone else noticed this? I would be really curious if any current owners have had this problem. I wonder if the damage is happening and they haven't noticed it, yet. It only happens to the four discs attached to the inside of the front and back of each case; the two discs mounted on the center wing, Ive had no problem with. Ive called Amazon and reported the problem and they offered me a small refund ($40).

Someone else must be experiencing this issue. If you have this problem, please respond to this review. Thank you!",1506297600,14,1145,4.553398058252427

5038637,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I was 8 years old when this came out and was a big fan. I raced home from school to see it. it is what probably started my love of spooky/scary shows. when I first heard the intro music and some of the background music I brought back all kinds of memories of my childhood.
  The acting is off at times and there are plenty of mistakes made by the actors, the filming at time is not very good but the dark sets and the scenes of the houses are one of the things that make this great as well as the story line. I  have always liked stories about haunted house with secret passages and rooms. The dark and gloomy look to this adds to help make it spookier. It sometime fells like an old Frankenstein movie.  IT starts in black & white and then goes to color about 1 1/2 years in. but still maintained the fell of the old black & white which I actually find spookier.
  I am on episode 330 as of now. I remember something's but not that much as I watch it but I am thoroughly into it and hooked like I  was as a kid. I have also learned a lot about the series and actors that I didn't know and am finding very interesting.

5038639,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I have great memories of running all the way home from school to get there in time to watch that day's episode of Dark Shadows, peeking out from behind my hiding place behind the sofa because the show scared the pants off of me.  I know that compared to today's productions it was melodramatic and took itself probably way too seriously, but it was awesome!  Putting one of the discs into my player just gives me a warm glow of nostalgia.  The coffin makes a really neat display on my shelves and watching the shows is almost like taking a trip back in time.  Love it.",1497916800,6,568,4.330188679245283

It's great to have a collection of all the episodes, especially since the first 200 or so episodes are almost impossible to find. The collectors coffin is much larger than I anticipated (it weighs about 15 lbs) but it's fantastic. Great way to arrange the discs. I'm extremely pleased.",1495584000,,427,4.706666666666667
5038654,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I got hooked after watching one episode on my day off work back 1996 when the show aired on the SyFy Channel. Years later, I bought the entire collection. Great show! The one thing I was annoyed with was how the Victoria Winters storyline was never resolved. Sure, writers made it obvious the she was Mrs. Stoddard's long lost daughter, but they never mentioned anything else about her past once Barnabas Collins was introduced. Afterwards, the show became all about the adventures of Barnabas and Julia Hoffman. Nonetheless, I loved the show!",1494374400,,543,4.913043478260869

I feel the writers did an excellent job, as this keeps you on the edge of your seat. The actors are perfect in their rolls.

I probably would not want young children watching, just my feeling.

I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys suspense .

The only negative I have is the coffin case takes a ton of shelf space, so I have had to place this in our basement ( I have the entire collection of prisoner of cell block h, and that is in a square box, easy for storage.)",1492732800,,576,4.070796460176991

5038658,2,B006Z7Z3KY,"Love the packaging--is that the reason for the bloated price on this set? The above quotation is from this horror movie feature one TV station used to run late Saturday night in my hometown called ""Chiller Theater"". Its host was one of the newscasters done up in a bedraggled ""mummy costume"", half-unraveled wrappings and all, with a special effect used to make him transparent. He would open the program with the ""revised"" nursery rhyme I quote in this review's title. In ""Dark Shadows"", Jonathan Frid's Barnabas Collins portrayal was completely different from that of Johnny Depp's urbane Brahmin delivery in his more-recent 2012 feature film;

Girl; ""What are you, stoned?""
Barnabas; ""They tried to stone me, my deah--it didn't work.""

Frid in turn was nothing like ""Dracula's"" sinister Hungarian depicted by Bela Lugosi that everybody knew how to imitate (""I vant your blood"")--he was this smooth well-spoken personable type who talked like your doctor. Or your kid's school principal. It was hard to buy him as a vampire. And for me, it's even harder (call it ""impossible"") to buy this set.",1487980800,,1095,5.044198895027624

But I was able to get (again) *some* of the episodes on VHS, and (still again) *some* on the DVD collections, and through it all, never the entire series and what I had had severe gaps in the storyline. Finally, a time came when I had to discard my videotape collection due to space requirements. I thought I would never see the series in its entirety, until I came across this collection, every episode...in order...no gaps in a nice sturdy box that takes up hardly no space whatsoever. To make the deal even sweeter, was the fact that I was able to get it for just under 400.00 (thanks to an Amazon sale price).

I especially enjoy seeing/ meeting the writers, unsung cast members, behind-the-scenes directors/producers/personnel after a disc has been played throughout between episodes.

5038683,5,B006Z7Z3KY,I ordered this coffin box set from MPI home video. The Deluxe Edition. Mine did not include a signed card by Jonathan Frid though. I read a review where someone said their is 134 dvd's. Correction. Its 131 dvd's. One caveat I have though is all the DVD cases on back at bottom has B/W (Black and White). According to the episode guide #295 episode was the first color episode. So MPI either overlooked this or just didn't realize that the cases just have B/W on them all. And not BW and color. Did not watch yet but I am going put a DVD in from middle of the coffin box and see if it's in color. MPI probably an over looked mistake in printing the sleeve included in the DVD cases.

This is okay, cause this keeps the picture in the same quality of the original recordings. They aren't perfect, but, this show wasn't perfect when it was aired.

All the cases are housed in a sturdy box shaped like a coffin as you can see. The show is pretty amazing because it was made before all the special effects technology that we have today. The creators were pretty clever making each episode which took an entire day to complete. There are bloopers here and there (nothing too outrageous) that would not occur today, but are fun to spot. An overhead microphone shadow crossing the screen, a miss said line, etc. The shows were broadcast live so there were no out takes possible.

5038807,3,B006Z7Z3KY,"Well, I can't judge this too badly because all the disks were there.  However, 1 DVD jacket had a tear at the bottom where you could see the DVD showing.  I checked it out, no scratches and it still played good. I gave it 3 stars for the way it was packaged.  After I checked all the DVD's that were all in correct numerical order, I also checked for scratches on the disks and could NOT find anything damaged on them.  I decided to keep it knowing that if I exchanged it, it would've been a nightmare having the product even more damaged.  The box (casket like) came with a few nicks and cuts but I used a good ole ""sharpe"" marker to do the trick.  Other than that, the collection is simply worth having in spite of the slight damage on the DVD jacket, as long as the disk wasn't damaged, it was worth keeping.  I'm glad I decided to keep it as oppose to complain about every little small thing that can be fixed.  To make this short, please purchase it (that's if you're a die hard DS fan).  Each episode from the beginning, had you on your toes, love the variety of suspense, gothic, ghosts, vampires & thriller, and for this, I give it FIVE STARS.  What a unique soap opera.  I purchased this set in memory of my deceased mother (who just passed away two months ago).  I used to see her watch every episode of this series, one of her favorite all time classics.  I was only 5 yrs. old back then and was ""petrified"" to watch it with my mom.  Now I am the official ""owner"".  I only wish my mom was here to watch it with me. :(  However, she would be proud to know that I own the collection.  You won't be disappointed folks.  I'm now on episode 49, and yes, this series is still interesting from the very 1st DVD, it just keeps getting better.  I can't wait to go home tonight and watch it.  WHOOO  HOOOO.................

This past weekend they did a binge marathon of this awesome soap which was so infinitely appropriate for Halloween and I was glued to the tv since 4am Sat to 4am today just watching Dark Shadows!!! It's fun horror, terror, fright, and bone chilling extravaganza!!!! I am so addicted to this show now!!!!! And almost cried when the weekend marathon ended this morning. Dark Shadows is Halloween fun to the max!!!! This show has this hauntingly relaxing effect-- you're scared out of your mind but at the same time the haunting and creepy music just puts you in a trance like Maggie Evans and Vicki Winters!!! :) There is always that Victorian sexiness of a vampire hovering over a beautiful girl while she's asleep- I wish I can have my boyfriend do that to me!!!!! ;)  this show is infinite frightening fun!! I cannot emphasize how wonderful this show is!!!!! It's like a horror novel coming to life!! I will definitely buy season 1!!! I have to own at least one season!!!

P.S. I got mine during a one-day promo I heard about through the Collinsport Historical Society for $224.99. With points applied and 5% cash back on the balance it worked out to $142.99 . That's $1.09 per disc or 12 per episode, and it arrived in plenty of time for Halloween. I just had to rub that in.",1445817600,14,557,4.514851485148514
5038823,2,B006Z7Z3KY,"Not sure how to rate this show. Never having heard of it before 2012, I began watching it through those separate volume DVDs. I started from the very beginning (before the arrival of Vampire Barney) and was immediately hooked. Couldn't stop watching. It took me away to another time and place. The town seemed so real. The setting seemed so real. And the characters seemed like real actual people. The storylines had mystery & intrigue. I had to restrain my self from going through the series too fast!

But then, once Vampire Barney came along, the show got a bit silly, but I still went ahead and bought the whole boxed set hoping it would only get better. It kept me engaged well enough even though I was beginning to get loathsome of the silly way Barney Collins was inserted into the program. He shows up at Elizabeth's door claiming to be a ""distant relative from England,"" and Liz Collins excepts his word at face value! Without even checking for references, she just accepts Barney into her happy home. All these weird things keep happening around her and no one can make the connection between the weird occult occurrences and the new household occupant! And Barney seems to have nothing at all to do but abduct women in order to convert them into his long lost love Jossette Dupree (I think that was her name) and to constantly keep his vampirism a secret from everyone accept Doctor Hoffman and Bill Loomis, his personal slave.

After Maggie Evans escapes from Barnabas's abduction, she never goes back to work in the hotel cafe and we don't know what she even does for a living until Vicky Winters departs from the show and Ms Evans assumes her role as the governess of Collinwood. This show has a tendency to often leave storylines unfinished. One big example is the character Adam, who is a Frankenstein type character created to heal Barney of his vampirism. After many months of terrorizing Barney and everyone else at Collinwood, Adam disappears from the show without explanation! And this is also the time Vicky (Alexandra Moltke) makes her departure from the series and is replaced as governess by Maggie Evans; but Maggie is not as visually appealing as Vicky and lacks her charismatic charm; moreover, the actress who plays her, Katherine Leigh Scott, has limited talent as an actress and is not nearly as good as Alexandra Moltke.

At this point, late 1968, the show begins to meander into goofy storylines that just seem to endlessly drag. They begin to shove these two annoying kids, with screechy voices, in our faces they're endlessly carrying on about some new ghost named, ""Quentin"" who they at first communicate with through a toy telephone. I often forwarded through a lot of those episodes. Now here I am at around April 1969 and I barely watch the show at all because it's boring me silly! They've got another time travel story that just drags and drags and goes takes forever to get to the point. Unlike the previous time travel storyline, this one has no direction. The actors, with acception to Humbert Allen Astredo, become more stale & generic as the series moves along.  And the characters don't even come off as real or authentic any more. What's more funny is the fact that no one at Collinwoood seems to have any life at all. Aside from silly putty  for ghosts, vampires, warewolves, or Frankensteins, they are total losers! None of them seem to work or earn a living (accept for Maggie Evans of course), so how do they take care of themselves and pay all their bills?! Anyone know?

When I started watching this show, the characters seemed more genuine and seemed to have something more to do with their lives other than fool around with ghosts and goblins all day. They even seemed to have had jobs! And Barney Collins, who started out as a Vampire, is cured of his vampirism after one year, and the only time he even goes back to being a vampire anymore is when he mentally travels thru time into his past body. The moral of all this is: don't judge a TV show by its early episodes! Know what you're getting into before committing to a 300 plus dollar boxed set!

Now I wonder if I even WILL continue watching this show at all. Or will I remain forever trapped in April of 1969? That is the real question...!",1444780800,6,4252,4.63129973474801

The case that they come in is larger than the picture shows.  It is a casket with hinges and a clasp.  The DVDs have an average of 5 per jewel case.  What sets this off is that the edge of all the DVDs combined show the likeness of Barnabas.  You can buy the DVDs separately, but that will cost more in the long run..  If you can afford it, I suggest that you buy this set as it comes with all the bells and whistles. As you can see by the photo of the coffin, you can just make out the likeness of Barnabas.

My aunt, who's a huge fan of the show, tried purchasing a complete set from eBay a couple of years back, but when it arrived, it was all bootlegged, and half of the disks didn't play. Unfortunately, she was unable to return them. But this past year, since she'd done so much for me, I really wanted to surprise her. So for Christmas of 2014, I got her these.

It made an impression on me enough so I remembered a few characters and always wanted to see all the episodes. My husband got me this as a birthday gift....we watched them all the way through together, and loved it. I am re-watching them now while hubby is working during the day. I will watch them over and over. This was a great purchase, very nice quality on the coffin box, the individual dvd cases and on the dvd's themselves. Everything is great and I will enjoy this gift for many years to come! I would recommend this to any Dark Shadow's fan, it has lots and lots of interviews of the actors/actresses, directors, camera people, music directors, absolutely everyone seems to have given an interview, and I loved seeing those.

I actually started streaming these episodes through netflix and then hulu plus but they are limited showing only episodes 210-450 something.  I had gotten hooked, so I decided why not get the whole series?  It's a lot of episodes that may take you a couple years to watch through but if your like me and hate the satellite monthly fees then you can cut the pay tv services and enjoy tv shows this way with no commercial interuption.  With the tons of extras and interviews loaded into the set any Dark Shadows fan will be happy about their purchase.

5038854,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"On April 10, 2012, the complete, original ""Dark Shadows"" (1966-1971) was released as a DVD set.  For many of our generation, the series had been the ultimate in exoticism and eroticism.  For this writer, it was the germ of his aesthetic.

The ABC program began as a Gothic romance, in beautiful black & white, in the manner of a contemporary Henry James.  This black & white was an inestimable boon to its phenomenal popularity, since it gave off a strong Expressionistic flavor.  When it turned to color (as all television programs were doing at the time), the garish colors, fashions, and coiffures of the era were mercilessly exposed.  It compromised the exalted purity of the conception.

As is well known, it was with the introduction of a vampire that the series took flight, as it were.  Jonathan Frid as Barnabas Collins became the cynosure of the enterprise, engendering multitudes of admirers.  This was because, in the midst of the ugly chaos of the nineteen-sixties, here was a gentleman of the oldest school.  Frid's theatrical, even Shakespearian, background gave him a melodramatic, mysterious, mannered approach to acting, which was--and still is--captivating.

Indeed, many actors from the New York theatre appeared on the show, which gave the show its energy and its rather abstract quality of the bizarre.  Much has been made of the obvious mistakes, actors forgetting lines (especially the great Frid), film equipment showing up on screen, sets falling over, etc.  But one has to watch it as one would theatre, with all its incidental problems.  It will be worth the viewer's while, for the epic nature of the series is without equal, the vaulting ambition, the daring of the script transcending centuries, and the bravery of the actors in giving their all in performance.  The romances were invariably risible, but the underlying eroticism was volcanic.

Mr Frid, late in life, declared that if Bela Lugosi's ""Dracula"" was a ballet, ""Dark Shadows"" was an opera.  Exactly.  And while Robert Cobert's score was atmospheric, it should have been of the School of Schoenberg.

There are great actors to be seen here, the present writer's favorites being Frid (with his great mystique), John Karlen (extraordinarily versatile, intense, and charming), Joan Bennett (a still-beautiful film actress of the previous generation), Grayson Hall (highly volatile), Lara Parker (stunning as an erotic witch who was never baptized), and, in secondary rles, Michael Hadge (as a beatnik who rode a motorcycle), Michael Maitland (a child-actor of frightening intensity), and Caveda Humphrey (as a highly-theatrical Mme Findlay).  It is inconceivable why so few cast members went on to major careers.

Two films were made in the wake of the series, ""House of Dark Shadows"" (1970) and ""Night of Dark Shadows"" (1971), neither very remarkable.  In 1991, NBC produced a short-lived remake which was fascinating save for the miscasting of the anti-hero, Barnabas Collins.  The 2012 feature film directed by Tim Burton was a vicious, unspeakable parody of the original.",1435104000,4,3064,5.182926829268292

I have watched the first 19 discs and there were two of the discs that had a couple problems with them.  They would stop/freeze for a minute before playing again and this would happen several times during playtime.  Towards the end of one of the discs, even before the show was finished, the disc just stopped and ejected.  This was a new 131 disc set and not used.  If the discs would not play at all, I would be very dissapointed and would have returned them.",1428019200,,577,4.305555555555555

I had not gotten the series on DVD because on a military disabilty pension full retail price of all 32 four disc sets (over $1900.00) was too high. Thank god I had only bought 5 used sets under a $25.00 or less per set rule when I came across this & on my wish list it went with a link to it sent a few close friends. As I hoped it is my Christmas and birthday present from my x and his husband. It just got here and it's great absolutely perfect condition inside and out all discs present and accounted for no damage.

5039118,5,B006Z7Z3KY,Jonathan Frid Best Vampire ever.,1413763200,2,32,5.6
5039119,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"With hundreds of reviews, what can I add?

I'd been watching the entire series on rip-off copies from China for four years.  I didn't know they were ""bootleg"" copies until they arrived.  About 15% of the discs did not work so I was always going to youtube to see the issues I couldn't see from my collection.

When originally aired, I watched it after school in 5th and 6th grade.  Running home to see it was a must.

Besides the great casting, the great set designs, and storylines, I firmly believe that the music written for this show was very important in its success.  I think the first year before Barnabas arrives is fantastic, though I understand at the time before Barnabas emerged in the storyline that the show was on shaky ratings.  Maybe the music helped it get it through the first year?  The music is excellent.  I also have the five CD collection of all the soundtrack music from the series. (It's actually an 8 cd collection as pointed out by a comment to this post.)

If you were to start watching this series on the wrong episode you could get the idea that it's cheesy and cheap.  But being a live show, day after day and at the hazards of cast changes and tight budgets there are bound to be lulls in the story lines as they develop, mature, and then shift to the next storyline.  The entirety of the series has a remarkable relevance to many basic plots and many details which intertwine and remain relevant to storylines way down the timeline.  This is what makes the entire series so enjoyable to watch, the global relationship between all the storylines and changes.

Despite the occasional times of flatness in story, the overall development of each time period or storyline successfully builds to an exciting and complicated intersection of plots before being thrust into a new time setting.  What is really remarkable is the excellent acting carried on day after day, the excellent cast of theatrical personnel (as opposed to TV actors), the superbly excellent set designs and the remarkable special effects that they carried off on such a limited day to day schedule.  The entire show is an important period piece because it is both genius and a beautiful example of the technology of the time.  Both the black and white and the in-color shows at times look like moving paintings; this appears to be because of the very dramatic and creative lighting and camera shots along with the limited quality of television transmission at the time.

I am not vampire fan, vampirism is not why I love this show.  I love the show because it is high drama between the innocent - the afflicted - , and the enforcers of evil; classic good against evil at times much like a comic strip; but there is a strong dramatic identification with the human frailties of all the characters.  The gothic setting is very appealing to me.

I could make a long list of the excellent actors on this show and a short list of those whom had less finesse.  The actors play many roles which plays into the plot(s) nicely and endears the viewer to the family that this troupe really is.  The overall acting, frank and in presence as if on a stage, but with no re-do's nor long rehearsals like a continuing nightly two hour stage musical makes the performances and the entire series remarkable.

5039217,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I'll try and make this review as comprehensive as possible. We're closing in on the 50th anniversary of this series, and this is undoubtedly one of the biggest TV complete DVD sets yet released (rivaled only by Australian soap ""Prisoner: Cell Block H"", which has its own equally dedicated cult audience).

First, my own bias: I'm much, much younger than the series, and I came to it about five years ago, gradually making my way through all 1,225 episodes . So it's worth noting, for anyone coming to this series, that ""Dark Shadows"" was filmed live-to-tape in the 1960s, one episode a day from rehearsal to final taping, and broadcast usually within a week of that date. Tapings were rarely cut (leaving many so-called bloopers, which reflect live stage practices), the viewers - watching, after all, on TV sets common in the '60s - hardly expected to remember continuity or to be concerned about special effects, and sets and actors generally kept to less than 5 per episode for obvious financial reasons. Anyone coming to this series expecting 2014 production values will be sorely disappointed, but at the same time anyone expecting to watch this ironically - as something hilariously inept - will be let down. The cast, writers, and crew of ""Dark Shadows"" really were at the top of their game much of the time, and - even as a twentysomething raised on HBO-level TV - I must concede that this is quite a grand achievement. (It's interesting to read reviews of the invididual DVD sets, where it seems many people purchasing this item are middle-aged and remember it from the '60s, with a kind of rose-tinted nostalgia. Cute, but hardly useful for determining the success of a series fifty years on, or of a DVD set overall.)

It's here I'll stop to point out that there has recently been an outbreak of counterfeit sets. It's worth Googling to fint the key differences, as sets sold on eBay may be counterfeits. While some sets work fine, many have reported individual discs to be faulty, and certainly the overall quality of the set is markedly less. Watch out! Anyhow:

First of all, the series itself. ""Dark Shadows"" is a pretty impressive body of work, airing from late 1966 to mid-1971. The story is well-known by this point: young orphan Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke) takes a job as a governess at Collinwood, a gloomy mansion and estate overlooking the small Maine town of Collinsport, which operates mainly on fishing and small industry. The Collins family are the heads of the town - both financially and socially - but all is not right. Among the occupants of the house are a reclusive matriarch (Joan Bennett), a spoiled child (David Henesy), and a father with many secrets (Louis Edmonds). Victoria and the other new arrival in town, ex-con Burke Devlin (Mitchell Ryan), are about to get absorbed into this chaos. From these soapy beginnings, creator Dan Curtis and his talented writing staff crafted a story that encompassed three centuries, three different bands of time, and hundreds of characters. Gradually introducing the supernatural (originally as a way of boosting ratings), the series rarely lost touch with its more character-based elements. The long-time directors (particularly Henry Kaplan and Lela Swift) were tasked with making 25 minutes of television every day, and did very well. At its worst, the writing can be plodding, making the series tough to get through (the most dreary are a seemingly endless dream curse and a murder mystery that largely revolves around the location of a pen). At the other end, such stories as the 1795 flashback and - although it's less well-remembered - the deftly-crafted 1840 storyline, manage to make the most of their time.

The bloopers, low production values, and technical issues are there in abundance, but it's impressive how well the series does. Long before ""Twin Peaks"" and ""24"" revolutionised television, it was the nighttime soap that could craft storylines over several years. And before that, it was the daytime ones. Relying on housewives and shut-ins (at that time, the norm rather than the exception for middle-class women and the elderly), ""Dark Shadows"" could make references in a 1970 episode to something that happened in 1967 and expect the audience to keep up, even in an era before the internet! This allows the writers a great deal of flexibility. It's true that the scripts can sometimes lack punch, or at least show the strings (the phrase ""I don't know"" in response to a question is almost a parody by the end of the series - anything to string out the story!) but some of the character work is first rate, and the scripting of numerous storylines is simply superb. Not just ""for its medium"" but for television as a whole. On occasion, particularly with the characters of Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid), Gabriel Collins (Christopher Pennock), and Samantha Drew Collins (Virginia Vestoff), there are some absolutely marvelous character examinations. It's not all perfection, that's for sure. When special effects or performances don't work, they sometimes really don't work (Curtis' ambition was his defining feature, but it sometimes met its match with the rigors of daily television). The series' first few months were long-forgotten because they contained almost nothing supernatural and so were rarely repeated, and were the last to be released on VHS and then DVD. They certainly don't have the flair of the later episodes but are actually grounded in very good performances. Over the course of the series' five years, the writers explored both realist and more expressionist moments, while the cast ranged from old film stalwarts to theatre actors of the new generation, from avant-garde performers like Grayson Hall to soap-opera veterans. You will need patience to get through the series, certainly; if you don't think you can stomach a 1,225-episode story, then I'd stay away! But the series does reward, particularly if you're a multi-tasker like myself, and can have it on as you go about your day.

There are also a few devastatingly poor performers in the mix who tend to drag down the episodes they're in (I won't mention any names!) and the child actors aren't always great, although I disagree with some of the harsh things I've seen on the internet about them. I've always been particularly impressed with young David Henesy, although his best work was - strangely - in the show's first year. Like most child actors of the era, he's quite a mannered performer, but truthfully he had a maturity far beyond his years and this comes across, at least to me. Finally, it's worth mentioning the series' greatest innovation: no, not its trope-changing approach to the reluctant vampire, but the decision to cast its actors in a repertory format. When the series chose to return to 1795, it made sense to keep the contracted cast to play their own ancestors. What this did can't be understated. It allowed the series to truly follow through on its threats to the characters (you can kill anyone off, knowing you can just invite the actor back); it meant the series could hope to retain some very talented theatre actors by allowing them to play vastly different characters (series MVPs must surely include Marie Wallace, Clarice Blackburn, Christopher Pennock, John Karlen, Thayer David, Grayson Hall, and the great, great Nancy Barrett, who was with the series for the entire run but never had the fame she deserved after it came to an end); and it gave the series a fascinating palette of connections between characters that have allowed fans to geek out to this day.

Ultimately, this series will mostly appeal to those with fond memories of it from their younger years; to soap opera fans (it really is a supreme example); to TV buffs (my main interest in the series, to be honest, is how fascinated I am by methods of television production over the years); and hopefully to those with enough time on their hands and willingness to explore! I personally recommend starting from the start (get a jigsaw puzzle, some coffee, and some chores), but if you are concerned about not enjoying the ""early years"", jump in at 202. You'll still have a few episodes before the much-hyped arrival of Barnabas, but it will allow you to get a sense of the characters and situation, and comes just after the major storyline of the first 200 episodes - the history of Burke and Roger - has been resolved. Dan Curtis was a fascinating man, so knowledgeable about how to create a story, and yet in some ways a man who never got his full public dues. It's still wonderful to see this series, and to uncover the long and passionate fanbase it still maintains. (What other daily soap could profess to have its whole run available on DVD?)

For those out there who aren't fans of the supernatural, I'm on your wavelength. I don't enjoy ""True Blood"" or ""The Walking Dead"" (although I adore the craftsmanship of the heights of ""The X-Files""). Undoubtedly, much of the series is given over to witchcraft and vampirism, but I think the drama of the series actually transcends that for the most part. Many of the series' storylines were taken from classic literature, such as ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Frankenstein"", so you'll appreciate those if you're familiar (although occasionally the riffs are very overt!)

And if you enjoy the series, you should then check out the two ""Dark Shadows"" movies from 1970 and 1971 (not direct continuations of the series but kind of variations on the theme with much of the same cast), the 1991 revival series (which reportedly would have been renewed for a second season were it not for the Gulf War), and - as much as it does not follow the tone or attitude of the series - the 2012 movie starring Johnny Depp. Finally, if you really become a fan, the British company Big Finish has released a series of audio dramas starring members of the original cast, exploring various avenues from the series' numerous timelines. In book form, two of the series' most prominent cast members - Lara Parker and Kathryn Leigh Scott - have continued the ""Dark Shadows"" legacy, the former with fiction and the latter with non-fiction. I have not read any of their books, but they remain popular with the fans. Finally, MPI has generously opened up their vaults and released the entire library of musical cues on CD. It's a ridiculously bulky and pricey set, that would probably only cater to the absolute anoraks among us, but if you want every single musical cue used on the show over five years, it's the set for you.

On to the DVDs themselves: 470+ hours over 131 discs. Let's just let that sink in. Wow. There's a lot to recommend, but it's worth pointing out that the collection is not ""perfect"" - at least not in the sense of the absolute greatest DVD collections like ""Seinfeld"". This is for two reasons, the first being that financially it would have been impossible to create enough extras befitting such a large set, so some of the extras are pretty threadbare. The second being that, as ""Dark Shadows"" already had a life on VHS and DVD, MPI have smartly repackaged much of this material to make sure that completists can have everything at their fingertips but sadly causing double-ups and redundancies.

So, let's start with the packaging. The series comes in a beautiful coffin-shaped set, which opens to reveal the 131 discs in a number of cases, the spines of which make up the sleeping body of Barnabas. Anything this bulky is bound to be a bit of a risk in the mail, and it's going to take up a lot of room on the shelf, but personally I'm not that concerned. It's pretty cool and - for a large coffin - reasonably tasteful.

The DVDs were originally released in 32 volumes, Collections 1 - 26, followed by the 6 ""Beginning"" sets encompassing episodes 1-209. Here, they have been ordered chronologically and repackaged, although the disc content itself has not been changed. As a result, most of the extras remain where they were in the individual releases, and the DVD menus somewhat incorrectly refer to the discs as ""Collection 4, Disc 2"", for example, which might be a bit confusing.

In terms of quality, the first third of the series is black-and-white, after which the series shifts to colour. The quality of the material varies but - if it wasn't for Dan Curtis' unique foresight - we likely would have few of these episodes at all. Many of the episodes are in great condition but some show technical glitches, and a dozen or so have missing master tapes, so patchy kinescope copies have been used. One episode at the end of the series is completely missing, but thankfully a fan recorded the audio of the series (as happened with all the missing ""Doctor Who"" episodes) and this has been reconstructed using photographic stills and a narration by Lara Parker. You're not going to get HD quality anytime soon, but it's reasonably good stuff.

The first 24 discs are the original ""Beginning"" episodes. Discs 25-126 feature the original 26 DVD collections. The menus are quite nice, and will automatically ""play all"" from whichever episode you choose to watch. The extras on these discs are all from the original DVD releases, and some of those were reappropriated from the '90s VHS releases. (You'll hear cast members referring to 30th and 40th anniversaries of the series as if they're current.) There are interviews on most discs with cast, crew, and critics. These are usually about 10 minutes long and range in quality, but all are fascinating. Some of the cast members (such as Parker, Scott, and Selby) clearly appreciate what the series is still bringing to their lives. Some are more indifferent, remembering the series mainly as a job they had, and some even seem bemused to be doing interviews for this old daytime soap! It's a smart (if unintentional) prism of approaches which allows the viewer to see the series as a job and a business rather than just a work of art. The writers, directors and producers particularly provide insight into the struggles the series faced. From time to time frontline crew members appear whose discussions of how the series was made can be a little technical but still worth watching. And finally there are the TV critics who give a modern viewpoint on what the series stood for. These guys know their stuff and - although they're obviously talking up the series - are able to place ""Dark Shadows"" in context. And it must be said, even when the interviews are occasionally frustrating, it's helpful that MPI has provided the VHS and original DVD interviews. Many of the actors are now deceased or very frail, and some of the opinions are neatly uncensored, rather than a bunch of interviews collected solely for the DVD which may have been more repetitive.

Many of these special features have a certain cobbled-together quality. Just to have the series on VHS originally would have been a treat, and MPI were happy to simply reach into the archives. As a result, the placement of other extras to complement the interviews is a bit haphazard, and the quality of the material varies. Disc 1 includes an introduction with Alexandra Moltke, Discs 4 and 24 feature various original commercials, rehearsal footage and newsreel footage. Disc 25 includes an ""Introduction"" which was designed for when the original DVD range started with episode 210. It's basically a highlight reel of the first 209 episodes, and feels a bit redundant on this larger set. Finally, Disc 4 contains a rather odd extra, in which Kathryn Leigh Scott - in front of a green screen - narrates a brief history of Collinsport, and a tiny introduction to the Collins family. To be frank, this feels underwritten; I can see what the series was going for with this, but I feel as if this may have been filmed for something else (a video game or some such?) and just transferred here because it was in the archives. It would have been nice to have some commentaries or some brand-new documentaries on the series. Shows like ""Seinfeld"" and ""Twin Peaks"" have impressed with open documentaries that were able to discuss elements that may have been sensitive at the time. How great would it be to hear about the creation of the series, the decision to move to various times, the gradual disenchantment that some lead stars such as Frid and Bennett developed, and the issues that led to cancellation. It would also perhaps have been fun to learn why some stars - such as Hall, Barrett, and David Selby - remained with the series for so long when they must have been tempted by other offers. Anyhow, not to be.

(Please note that, while the ""Limited Edition"" of this set included a signed, numbered postcard by Jonathan Frid, the ""Deluxe Edition"" is the name for the regular release, which does not include that postcard.)

The rest of the special features are collected on the final discs, and are a motley mix of archival, pre-released, and new pieces. There's everything from the sublime to the ridiculous, but again it's worth it for completists. To go through them:

Disc 126: ""Beyond the Shadows"": an important extra, in which Roger Davis narrates the original article DS writer Sam Hall penned for TV Guide back in November, 1971. It details what happened to all of the Collinwood regulars after the series had ended, which is alternately uplifting and heartbreaking. I'm really glad this came about. (Although it is edited from the original, which can be found online.)

Disc 127: ""Dark Shadows Tribute"": a very enjoyable compilation of interviews from conventions, clips, and other footage that was compiled for the show's 30th anniversary in the mid-90s. Like all of this footage, it's primarily cobbled together, and much of the charm can be in the accidental nature of seeing the actors and key crew members reveal much about themselves in the way they interact. However, much of the ""special footage"" here (for instance, interviews and commercials) can now be found on the later discs as supplementary material.

""Scariest Moments from Dark Shadows"" and ""The Best of Barnabas"": in the days of VHS and early DVD, MPI - like many companies - released compilation tapes that seem a bit weird in this day of complete series sets. The idea I guess was to appeal to fans who didn't have access to the whole series, and perhaps to attract newcomers, even if they were mostly buying them as misguided gifts for friends and family! Both of these are a bit odd, they're basically 45-minute compilation clips of the series. It's a nice idea but there's no context of the clips for new fans (the story goes basically chronologically, but what does that even mean on this show?). Good to have, I guess, but I'm not going to put it on any time soon.

""Dark Shadows: 25th Anniversary Special"": an older anniversary special which is just convention footage, but it's cute to see the actors engaging with the fans. This is particularly rewarding to see new footage of the actors that includes some good Jonathan Frid material, and other things that we didn't get to see in the interview features elsewhere in the set.

Disc 128: ""The Making of 'Return to Collinwood'"": a great little documentary on the first audio drama, written by David Selby's son and featuring many of the original cast. It's not particularly in-depth, and it doesn't explain why some of the big names didn't appear, but it's great to see the cast genuinely engaged with the subject and enjoying being reunited. Particularly given that this led to a bigger series of audio dramas for the show, it's worth watching.

""Dan Curtis: Before the Shadows"": an all-too-brief interview with Curtis, where he explains how he got to the point in his life and career where he created the series.

""The Mistress of Collinwood"": a brief series of interviews with cast and crew about original cast member Joan Bennett, undoubtedly the most famous name when the series began.

""A Fan Remembers"": particularly interesting. Jay Nass, a fan of the series from the 1960s, would spend his afternoons with his other teenage friends waiting outside the ABC studios to get autographs with the cast. His reminiscences are a neat insight for people like myself into how the fan relationship with the show worked (given its afternoon timeslot, the youth attraction really helped the series stay on the air). He also gives some anecdotes about meetings with the cast which are refreshingly diverse, and the feature includes clips from his own home movies of the cast arriving and leaving from the day's work. A much-appreciated extra, and it's a shame that more original footage like this doesn't survive.

""1970 Dark Shadows Rehearsal"": unfortunately, given the series' age, there is very little in the way of outtakes or extra footage. As a result, much of what is sprinkled throughout the set is a bit lifeless, but I appreciate MPI making the effort. This footage of Lara Parker rehearsing and blocking the scene is an effective example of what daily life was on the series, especially when working with special effects.

""1984 Dark Shadows PBS Promos"": Archival commercials done by Jonathan Frid as part of a PBS pledge drive.

""1969 ABC-TV Promo Announcements"": some examples of closing credits from the show featuring announcements about other television shows and the 1969 moon landing.

""The Beginning"": an advertisement for ""The Beginning"", the six volumes of DVD which were released last but contained the early episodes.

""Dark Shadows Vampires & Ghosts"": another compilation of existing clips from the series.

""Movie trailers"": actually a very worthwhile little extra! Featuring about 10 movie trailers, including ""House of Dark Shadows"" and ""Night of Dark Shadows"", the remaining are archival trailers for movies starring original cast members of the show. They're interesting to see the cast members outside of this element (Joan Bennett in ""Father of the Bride"", Lara Parker in a B-movie with Peter Fonda and Loretta Swit called ""Race with the Devil"") but also just as examples of movie trailers from the '50s, '60s, and '70s. Fascinating stuff.

Disc 129: ""Bloopers & Outtakes"": sadly, very boring. The 45-minute bloopers clip is the result of interns going through hundreds of hours of episodes. It seems to feature every single time someone passed by the screen during filming, an actor stumbled over so much as one syllable, or a door didn't close properly. There's no narration, little in the way of recognisable segments, and many of the bloopers are so minimal you have to strain to notice them (like when the music kicks in a few seconds too early and overrides the last word in a sentence). There are probably nine or ten minutes of legitimate and hilarious bloopers from the series, so it's a shame that they're mixed in amongst another 30 minutes of minor difficulties. The few minutes of ""outtakes"" really just show how little extra material survives, which is a shame.

""Dark Shadows Music Videos"": an odd one, but not unwelcome. This is just a series of compilations, but this time they are set to music with the dialogue muted. Recognisable tunes from the series play over related clips, as well as some shorter musical moments from the series, like the singing of ""London Bridge"" and Pansy Faye's vaudeville number. Again, it's not so much a special feature as a presumably already extant compilation extra, but MPI have left no stone unturned it seems!

""Dark Shadows in Salem"": one of the many promotional items that appear on these discs, not unwelcome but ultimately not that rewarding. Here, Lara Parker promotes a book she wrote about Angelique and Barnabas, and in doing so spends some time in the town of Salem speaking with ""real-life"" witches. Parker looks a tad uncomfortable, and the history of Salem is quite simplified, but I hope she sold some copies of the book!

""Game Shows"": this is more like it. Archival recordings of episodes of ""What's My Line"" and ""Generation Gap"" which featured appearances by Joan Bennett, Jonathan Frid, David Henesy (as well as his mother), and the werewolf (stuntman Alex Stevens). All of the appearances are blatantly ABC cross-promotional opportunities, but it's fun to see the actors in a more relaxed state.

""Promos"": a cute and quirky addition. These are three assorted promos by Frid, Parker, and Scott from previous decades. However, rather than the promos, we get the outtakes, which makes these rather delightful.

""Comedy Tonight"": short but funny appearances by Jerry Lacy from a variety comedy show, co-starring Diana Canova and the sublime Madeline Kahn!

""Dark Shadows Pillow Commercial"": a genuinely hysterical pillow commercial from the '60s, for ""Groovy Horror Heads"" featuring the faces of Quentin, Barnabas, and ""The Witch"" (whoever that is).

""Merchandise and Trailers"": a bunch of miscellaneous ads for books by cast members, and the Big Finish audio series.

Disc 130:
""Dark Shadows Behind the Scenes"": a genuinely good hourlong documentary, gathering together almost all the surviving cast members for brief reflections on the series. As with anything so long ago, we can't expect detailed discussions (although Nancy Barrett has clearly been consulting her diary!) but it's a great analysis of the beginning of the show, and its legacy. Not enough time is spent, perhaps on the ending, but that's not what this doco is about. It's particularly neat to see some performers like Diana Millay and Donna Wandrey, who are otherwise unrepresented in this set. Truth be told, this is probably the most insightful of the longer special features. It doesn't feel long enough - but for a series running more than 450 hours, what would?

""Dark Shadows Nightmares & Dreams"": Yet another compilation of scenes from the series.

""Dark Shadows on Location"": Aw, this is cute. Nancy Barrett wanders around a number of locations. The series didn't shoot often on location, but did so particularly in the first year to great effect. Barrett narrates a quirky little piece that explains a bit about filming techniques, the history of the series, and general facts about the locations. Not groundbreaking but it's the kind of thing there should have been more of in this set.

""Inside the Shadows"": the downside of this DVD release largely being an archive of previous events, is that this mini-documentary captures many things previously discussed about how Barnabas was introduced to the series, using different clips and different (but very similar) interviews with the late and wonderful Dan Curtis. It's largely clips, but I love how Curtis was always so frank in his interviews. He really openly discusses the mindset behind the creation and development of the series' most iconic character and how the series attempted to keep up its facade even once this novelty had passed.

""Spanish Episode #289"": Exactly what it sounds like!

""Rare TV commercials"": Okay, this is good fun. Among a miscellany of items are TV commercials - largely product commercials - featuring, among others, Humbert Allen Astredo, Marie Wallace, Jerry Lacy, and an unintentionally hilarious if well meaning Brut ad starring Roger Davis. There are also a few rare Dark Shadows commercials, including some that appear elsewhere in the set.

""Photo Gallery & Music Montage"": A lovely collection of archival photographs, this extra will probably only interest obsessives, but it's the most cost-effective way of getting this kind of material out to fans. (If you like this, you might be the kind of person who will shill out a few hundred bucks for the complete recording of every Dark Shadows musical cue ever!)

""Trivia"": An odd little holdover from the previous DVD releases, which lists a simple text history of the series, and outlines supernatural films that featured cast members from the series.

Disc 131:
""Dark Shadows Reunion"" and Backstage Reception: A 2-hour piece from the William Paley Centre, reuniting much of the surviving cast from the time. It's lovely to see the older cast getting together, and see them react to some interesting - and occasionally frankly batty - questions from the audience. It's a stark reminder again of how, for many of these performers, this was just one job for them, often hard to remember or take seriously decades later! The forum is clearly edited, and about 45 minutes is spent on video captures, but it's actually quite a good best-of, moreso than the weird compilation videos we see in this set. Quite lovely. The additional ""backstage reception"" is actually only about 3 minutes, and just a photo montage from the night.

""1969 Jonathan Frid Interview"" - Frid on the Merv Griffin Show. The actor himself is a fascinating person, an intellectual, Shakespearean actor who was never a good fit for soap opera, even though he became one of its defining figures. The interview is great, but it's also amusing because he's such a different person from those expected, and the conversation alternates between Frid trying to fit in, and Frid being himself. Unusual but enjoyable, particularly since Frid is sadly not well-represented in the special features elsewhere.

""1970 Joan Bennett Interview"" - Bennett on the Mike Douglas show. She's such a classic star, she has a lot of fun. It's a reasonably simplistic interview, but it's very funny and Bennett is absolutely a gem.

""1969 TV Promos"" - something else from the archives, some ads Kathryn Leigh Scott did for an Alabaman TV station.

In closing, the series can certainly present its own challenges but is definitely worthwhile if you're open to its age and length. And the DVD set has some flaws, but MPI is to be commended for providing all the episodes and archival material in such a format. ""Dark Shadows"" is a mix of ambition and limitations, of powerful moments and slightly silly ones. And it created an entire world that is still being expanded by both fans and the original cast. I'll probably not watch the series again for another 10 years, but when I do, I look forward to enjoying the rich history anew.",1401580800,7,29948,4.904028436018957

I figure it might take us an entire year to finish the series which is a nice delightful treat. How many other gifts have such a long entertainment value. It's a bit campy, but very addictive. It's a bit of a game with us to look for bloopers and if you're not expecting Shakespearian acting or state of the art special effects this is very enjoyable.

away.  I began watching Dark Shadows as a young bride in my brand new home.  The children in my neighborhood would run to
my house and run downstairs and sit on the chairs and sofa and floor and scream when Barnabas appeared on the screen.  I know just watching the series will bring back very fun memories for me.  My husband has now gone to be with the Lord and all the children have grown and now have grandchildren of their own.  When I see the children that would come to my home and watch Dark Shadows with me they will bring their grandchildren to see me and they always tell their grandchildren about watching Dark Shadows with me and how fun it was for them.  How they screamed in terror and jumped up and down when just the music came on.

So when I saw the chance to buy the entire series in one collection, I pounced.

Just beginning the series, I have been fascinated by the storyline before the arrival of Barnabas Collins.

I just love the undercurrent of dread that seems to lie just beneath the surface of these stories.

There's nothing like the original  T.V. show.

UPDATE2: since we chose amazon.com to purchase from, they are kindly offering two choices: 1) a partial refund for the broken disc, or 2) a full refund if we return the full box set.  If we go with 1), we will need to spend approx $20 to purchase Collection 2, which contains disc 29, but then we'll have an extra copy of discs 30, 31, 32.  If we go with option 2), shipping the whole thing back may be more trouble than it's worth since I probably threw away the original packaging the box set shipped in.

The moral of this story is ""check all discs as soon as you receive the box set.""

Original review...

My only complaint:

The intro to each episode from the first year (pre-Barnabas) was accompanied by a slate/ clapperboard.  As soon as the Barnabas episodes begin, there is no longer that slate telling you what episode # you're about to watch.  Didn't seem like a big deal at first, but now we never know which episode to cross off the list (yeah, we made an episode checklist).  Our DVD player's display feature does not include the chronological episode #, but only shows, for example, ""title 3 of 12"", but that includes special features, so you gotta kinda keep track of which episodes are on which disc.",1396137600,,1423,4.34469696969697

Then I would run into my bedroom and change my clothes and go into the kitchen and get my slice of peanut butter bread and my Coke and would be glued to the tv. I am now 62 years old and it is like living my childhood all over again.

5039265,4,B006Z7Z3KY,"Whenever I get a DVD collection, I copy the discs.  That way, I can store the originals away for safe keeping and watch the copies.  It was quite a chore backing this set up, since it's 131 discs.  It's taken me several months to do it.

When I got to disc #50, I discovered a pretty serious gouge in the disc, and one of the files on the disc would not copy.  I e-mailed MPI Video thru their web-site asking if there was some way to get the missing file, so at least I could make a working copy, even if the original could not be saved.

MPI said that if I sent them the disc they would replace it.  I was skeptical, but I didn't really have anything to lose, so I packaged the disc in a CD mailer, then put that inside a bubble envelope.  Several weeks passed and I was pretty sure the replacement disc was not coming.  Lo and behold, today I got an envelope with a replacement disc #50.

When I got to disc #124, I had another video file which would not copy.  This time, however, I was able to copy the file after several re-tries, so even though there is some sort of issue with this disc, I don't plan on trying to get a replacement.

If you buy this collection, I suggest going thru it and checking all the discs as soon as you get it.  If you really want to be sure, put each disc in your computer's DVD drive and copy a folder called ""VIDEO_TS"" to your computer's hard drive.  If that folder copies successfully, then the disc is OK.",1395014400,3,1442,4.103571428571429

This has Dark Shadows from the very first day!  We had watched DS on the Sci-Fi channel several years ago, and there was so much jumping going on, that we realize that the channel had left some episodes out.  By watching from day one, it also helped explain better the relationships between Burke Devlin and Roger, Vickie's search for her heritage, and the turmoil that David Collins suffered over his loss of an affectionate parent.  We started this Christmas day, 2013 and today is Feb 23, 2014, and we are just about to leave 1795.  There are bonus interviews on almost every disc so far---some at varying stages of the stars' lives.  We had been collecting the original dvd sets for several years, sometimes occasionally finding one or two at a used music/book store, and we had over half of the 26 set collection purchased.  However, when adding up how much the remaining ones would cost, not to mention that some are harder to find then others, we saved money and bought this set---can start watching without fear of interruption from missing episodes. and gave the others we had previously purchased to my sister in law, who now is just 4 volumes short of complete--(without the pre-Barnabus) episodes.",1393113600,4,1413,4.81404958677686

5039320,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Dark Shadows was a great unique show.  I remember watching it as kid and I liked the show very much.  Jon Frid did a superb job of portraying the character of Barnabas Collins.  I personally feel that he can probably never  be surpassed in that role.  He did a lot better job than Ben Cross and Johnny Depp in portraying  the role of Barnabas.  The rest of the actors on the TV show were also superb.  The dialog between the characters added flavor to the show.  The actors played different roles of being ancestors in different time periods such as the then present, 1795, 1897, Parallel Time, and the Future.  The show was suspenseful.  When Dark Shadows was great, it was great!  Thank you to the Dark Shadows cast for a superb job!",1392249600,2,735,4.443609022556391

Although both were tongue-in-cheek, the original was much better, mistakes were left in and you felt as though you were in the house or the coast line with the characters.

When Dark Shadows first came on I was at home with two small children.  Later I began business school, I would pick up the kids from the babysitter, we would rush home to watch the program while I fixed dinner.  My husband had brought me a small screen TV for the kitchen.  When I received the series, my son remembered watching it with me, although this was pre-school for him.

Overall this is a great series and I decided to keep it. Amazon since has removed this picture in the description to clear up any confusion.

The reviews were very complimentary, and it really is such a treasure that these episodes actually survived the decades. This set has been put together with loving care. The coffin case is heavy and very striking, the booklet has well-written one- or two-sentence summaries of every episode. It also has bonus features such as actor interviews and the very first episode including commercials (that's a time machine to watch!). Another thing I especially love is at the end of many of the episodes the announcer tells you what's coming up on ABC later, and it's full of memories. Where the Action Is, Rat Patrol, F Troop, The Newlywed Game, etc. This is the most entertaining collection I've bought in years - and I've bought a LOT of collections.

I remembered watching this as a kid but wasn't allowed to watch it because it was too ""dark"" at the time, but I was fascinated by it then. I taped (VHS) some of the shows during the run on cable TV but now in the digital HD age, these recordings don't do the show justice. And the tapes simply don't hold up over time.

I have been waiting for the chance to re-watch the series, but they are never shown on TV. I was aware of the MPA video tape and then DVD releases but the price for the entire series was out of my league. Until this set showed up on Amazon. Finally a way to acquire the entire series at a great price. Sold!

I love the set, love watching the series from beginning to end - this will take some time as the show was aired daily for a number of years. I look forward to viewing the last year of the series which I have never seen.

The episodes began in black and white with the introduction of Barnabas and continued up to the start of the colour episodes.  I was so disappointed when they abruptly ended the syndicated episodes because I was fascinated by the premise of a serialized gothic horror series!  I had seen individual DVDs for sale, but I wasn't interested in investing money in multiple dvd sets. When I saw the complete series at 40% off, I decided to make my move.  Afterwards, I couldn't believe I had bought 5 years (!) worth of episodes to watch!  When I package arrived, I was surprised by the size of the box, er, coffin.  So that's what 5 years (!) worth of episodes looks like!  I've just gotten to the storyline where Victoria travels back to the year 1795 and meets all of the familiar actors in new roles.  It's fascinating to see this story play out and Lara Parker is incredible as Angelique!  For a daytime soap opera, Dark Shadows was truly original.  I don't know how long it will take me to get to the end ... did I mention that there's 5 (!) years worth of video? ... but it's a great buy and a captivating series!",1385683200,5,1290,4.378151260504202

As a child I started watching this series in midstream, so it is great to be able to watch the series fom its inception. I am on episode 120, and really come to appreciate how it all began.  Really a great find.",1384128000,2,509,4.291666666666667
5039433,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Why couldn't this have come out years ago?!

Like many DS fans, I waited patiently for each new collection of episodes, released every other month in 40-episode bursts by MPI, and had all of the collections except for the later ""Early Years"" collections and 1 of the post-Barnabas collections.  This amazing collection has all of the episodes in the series plus a ton of great extras, and takes up way less space than all of the individual collections.  The coffin packaging is sturdy and beautifully detailed with metallic embossing and metal hinges.  The discs are organized and the well protected, something that is sadly lacking in a lot of the new whole series sets that seem to be coming out these days that just jam discs into cardboard sleeves, sometiems two at a time, and just hope for the best.

I was a little disappointed that the two feature films are not included in the collection, but was glad to see that they were finally released on DVD to coincide with the new Tim Burton adaptation.

This collection is a wonderful investment for the DS fan and the packaging, including Jonathan Frid as Barnabas laying in the coffin depticted on the spines of the DVD cases, is a real treat.  If you are have never seen the show, it might make sense to find a ""best of"" compilation or maybe one of the feature films to see if you enjoy the actors, the story, and the tone before picking up this collection, but this cult classic is still a fun indulgence after all these years.",1384041600,3,1483,4.573584905660377

I searched and waited to buy the entire series, but it was so cost prohibitive. 6 years ago, to buy the entire series would cost about $1,400.  I waited. And waited. When I saw this collection on Amazon, I leapt at the opportunity. Even though it's pricey, it's cheaper than any other way by which I'd seen you could watch the entire series in the past.

Even though it is not the deluxe version that included autographs, this was by far the lowest price I found for this collection. Opening it was like getting a long awaited gift on Christmas morning when I was a child. I ordered this mainly because there had been some damaged discs when I was renting the series from Netflix and I knew there was a lot I had missed. I purchased several collections individually before allowing myself to purchase this beautifully coffin shaped collection. Even though the discs are not remastered that's ok too. It's just good to know I now own the complete series which is such a nostalgic part of my childhood.

5039479,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"...and this is only a fraction of the magic of ""Dark Shadows"".  Imagine being an actor on this show...at that time, no one could have imagined, in their worst nightmares, that anyone could ever possibly see their humanity again.

VCR's didn't even exist, let alone Tivos or DVR's.  The show was televised ""live on tape"".  In other words, it was shot in sequence, with commercial time included, and it would take a catastrophic culmination of the most impossible disaster to call for a re-take.

SO...for you youngsters out there who say DS moves along soooo slow...dig this...at that time, there was NO MEANS to record the show if you weren't home...if you missed it, YOU MISSED IT!  SO...that's why the story moves so slow...in other words, something happens, then 15 minutes later, someone who wasn't there enters the scene and they get re-capped on everything that happens, then, in the next episode, someone else who wasn't there gets filled in on everything that happens...they're not filling in the character...they're filling in the housewife who missed the last 15 minutes or the last episode!

This show was basically live.  The camera comes on, you sink or swim.  And it is this immediacy that adds to your love of all the characters.  Collapsing sets, actors forgetting their lines, cameras floating into the shot, it's LIVE, and whatever happens ends up ON THE AIR!

So, of course, you cannot say enough anout Jonathan Frid.  Here's an actor who, admittedly, was TERRIFIED to be involved in a LIVE soap. So what does he do?  He transfers the terror from himself to his character.  And the magic begins.  We see a character 175 years out of his time, out of his element, the undead who must kill to survive (a necessary evil that repulses him), and the beleivability of all of that results from the transferrence and externalism of the INTERNAL TERROR of the ACTOR as he came to the set.

What brilliance.  What writing.  What acting.  What actresses!  When writng is so sublime that you can empathise with not only Barnabas and Quentin, but an Angelique so purely evil that Satan himself tells her to switch to decaf, this is breathtaking.

Sure, I watched DS as a child.  And I have dated 3 women who were actually MORE EVIL than Angelique.

If DS had been presented as a prime-time horror show, like the parallel-timed (and excellent) ""Invaders"", it wouldn't have made it.  But...c'mon, it was a freakin' SOAP OPERA!!!

Regarding this collection > the presentation is fantastic, the casket enclosure is a perfect touch, the episode guide itself isn't too useful to me, but it does have a lot of photos I had not before seen.  The bonus material, for the most part, is priceless...seeing the cast again and hearing their memories means so much to ""DS"" fans...once Jonathan Frid pops up, there are 9 or 10 episodes on each disc, so if you're settling in for a marathon, it's perfect.  I wish they would have continued the addition of the ""clapper board"" they included for episodes 1 - 208, but c'est la vie.

On a side note, 2 days ago I had the pleasure of attending a book signing by Lara Parker.  It was an absolutely wonderful experience.  She is so friendly, so gracious...she took the time to answer every - and I mean EVERY question that was asked of her, and she met with everyone and signed her new novel, ""Wolf Moon Rising"".

And so, in conclusion, just as I say ""Aladdin Sane"" is the coolest album ever made, though certainly not the best, so I say that ""Dark Shadows"", though maybe not the best, is simply the COOLEST TV SHOW EVER in HISTORY!!!",1377734400,7,3568,4.688102893890675

5039500,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Last year, I was introduced to the world of 'Dark Shadows' by Tim Burton's movie. I loved it, so I wanted to buy the complete series. This huge coffin set contains all 1,225 episodes on 126 discs. Discs 127-131 are nothing but bonus features including reunions, bloopers, and appearances on game shows. I started watching this series on July 20th, 2012 and I finally finished it tonight. It has been a great experience watching the whole series, but it has been stressful as well. I love how it changed direction once Barnabas Collins showed up. It's a shame that people diss the beginning episodes 1-210 because he hasn't shown up yet. Some of the stories were really good. This show is filled with ghosts, vampires, phoenixes time travel, witches, werewolves, monsters, warlocks, possession, crazy dream sequences and much more. It has a great classic look. There will be spoilers for those who haven't seen the series.

It was great in the beginning. Very mysterious with ominous characters who were always up to something, especially Burke Devlin. In the beginning, you have Victoria Winters, who has been asked by Elizabeth Collins Stoddard to come to Collinwood and be a Governess to Roger's son, David. I remember hating David in the beginning, but he got better as the series went along. Getting off the train with Vicky was Burke Devlin, one of my favorite characters. He has come back to seek revenge against Roger Collins for a crime he didn't commit. While Vicky is dealing with the ghosts of Collinwood, Roger, Sam Evans, and Burke must deal with the police and try to figure out who killed Bill Malloy. I love how business-oriented it was with the Garner lawyers and Burke trying to start a rival fishing fleet, and the noir feel of the who killed Bill Malloy story arc. I love how it just completely changes and goes to vampires, ghosts, witches, Frankenstein monsters and much more!

Sometime later, David's mother, Laura returns and wants to take David with her. Sam becomes possessed to draw a grotesque painting of Laura and David surrounded by flames. Vicky teams up with Dr. Guthrie to figure out what exactly Laura is, and why she wants David back so badly.

Elizabeth Stoddard has always been mysterious about keep people out of the basement, but it only gets worse when Jason McGuire shows up and blackmails her to marry him. This makes Carolyn Stoddard angry and she begins to date a biker named Buzz. This storyline got annoying, but it is all a buildup to a great re'vamp'ing of the series.

Jason's friend, Willie Loomis shows up to Collinwood, harassing them and looking for money. When he finds the Collins mausoleum, he finds something much worse. Barnabas Collins, a vampire from the 1790's is unchained on the present day family of Collinses. He started off as a monster by killing people who found out his secret, but as the series progressed, he became an anti-hero who would time-travel to save his family. He meets the waitress, Maggie Evans and kidnaps her, forcing her to marry him and become his lost love, Josette. When she escapes, she is taken to Windcliff Asylum, under the care of Dr. Julia Hoffman, who hypnotizes her and makes her forget everything. Dr. Hoffman arrives at Collinwood to figure out what happened to Maggie.  When she learns Barnabas's secret, she offers to help him and tries to cure his vampirism. When a seance is held to contact the ghost of Barnabas's sister, Sarah, Victoria Winters is transported back in time to Collinwood 1795.

The 1795 storyline was definitely one of my least favorite. In fact, I was tempted to skip it, but I pressed on. Vicky meets Barnabas before he was a vampire. The family in that time slowly begin to think Vicky is a witch because of her 1960's clothing. We are introduced to Angelique, the real witch who was in love with Barnabas. When Barnabas refuses her and wants to marry Josette, she places a curse on the family, making Jeremiah Collins fall in love with Josette, Sarah Collins become sick, and eventually turns Barnabas into the vampire we know and love. Reverend Trask arrives and holds a trial for Vicky for witchcraft. When she is hung, she is transferred back to 1968.

When Vicky gets back to 1968, Barnabas is afraid that she may have learned his secret. While driving at night, Vicky and Barnabas have a car-crash. Dr. Lang cures Barnabas of his curse and reluctantly agrees to help Dr. Lang with his 'project' Dr. Lang is trying to create life out of dead human parts, like Frankenstein. The monster comes alive, and named Adam. Barnabas tries to teach him, but Adam is very slow and dim-witted. Angelique returns and puts a dream curse on the family. (The dream itself is so cheesy that it's awesome) We are soon introduced to Warlock, Nicholas Blair, who is very interested in Adam and creating more monsters like him. Adam soon becomes violent and forces Barnabas and Dr. Hoffman to create a mate for him.

After Adam and Eve disappear, we are introduced to Chris Jennings, who becomes a Werewolf when the moon is full. Chris's sister, Amy begins a friendship with David and wonder off to a closed-off room in Collinwood. They find an antique telephone that holds the spirit of Quentin Collins. Quentin begins harassing the residents of Collinwood, so Barnabas uses the I-Ching wands to travel back in time to 1897 to stop him.

In 1897, Barnabas has become a vampire again and needs the help of gypsies, Magda and Sandor to protect him during the day. Magda has put the Werewolf curse on Quentin for killing her sister. Barnabas tries to help him fight it. Soon, they must deal with Count Petofi, an evil being with special powers in his hand.

When Barnabas returns to the present, he becomes the leader of a Leviathan cult, under their control. He recruits Megan and Philip Todd to help him. The Leviathans are after Paul Stoddard for a promise he made to them 20 years earlier. A Leviathan baby is born and grows rapidly into Jeb Hawkes. Jeb is infatuated by Carolyn, who he intends to marry.

Barnabas comes across a parallel time room at Collinwood. When he enters it, he's stuck there. Cyrus Longworth is working on an experiment that transforms him into John Yaeger, an evil alter-ego.

After escaping the parallel time room, Barnabas and Dr. Hoffman end up in the year 1995 and see that Collinwood has been destroyed. They learn that it's because of a ghost named Gerard Stiles. They use the Stairwell Thru Time and end up in 1970, where everything bad began to happen. David and Hallie Stokes become obsessed with a play room and are possessed by children that lived there in 1840.

Barnabas and Julia must once again travel back in time to 1840 to stop Gerard Stiles from taking over Collinwood. They learn that he became possessed by the head of Judah Zachery. Reverend Trask's son believes that Quentin is a Warlock and tries to convince the court to hang him. In the end, Barnabas succeeds and gets back to his own time. This seemingly would've been a great way to end the series because Barnabas was cured and everything was right with Collinwood, but it doesn't end there.

1840 parallel time, we are introduced to a new set of Collinses. Johnathan Frid is now playing Bramwell Collins, a human that is in love with Catherine. The Collins family must hold a lottery and force one member of the family to spend a night in a haunted room, possessed by Brutus Collins. Will the family finally be able to rid themselves of this curse?

I've had a great year watching this series, and it's all thanks to Tim Burton's film. This coffin set was well worth the $350 I spent on it. I will definitely revisit this show and watch my favorite classic episodes. I highly recommend DARK SHADOWS: THE COMPLETE ORIGINAL SERIES!!!",1371945600,7,7748,4.720414201183432

5039503,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"This is an urgent warning about the series ""Dark Shadows"" -

You will not be able to stop watching episodes and sometimes, like a vampire, you will stay up all night watching, even when you have to go to work the next morning.

You have been warned.

The story takes place on the ocean south of Bangor, Maine in what is, in real life, the Bar Harbor area - or Winter Harbor, Sedgewick, Tremont - it's hard to find cliff-side property there using Google Earth - the show's standard outdoor scenes including shots of ""Collinwood"" were filmed in Rhode Island where there are more cliffs apparently. Outdoor shots of the ""Old House"" were from a mansion in Tarrytown, New York where I later founded YourGrocer.com.

The meta story is that this is what the world was supposed to be, more or less, what the US was like in the 1960s. But the world changed big-time in 1967 just as this show was getting popular. It was only in 1967 that deaths in Vietnam sky-rocketed and it was only in 1967 that the Flower Power movement got into full swing. Dark Shadows showed what a small town in Maine would have been like during that time: not much change due to little contact with the outside world.

An interesting aspect of the DS series is that, in the first few years of taping, romantic telationships between characters were not politically correct by today's standards. 42 year old Barnabas and a middle-aged millionaire (Burke Devlin) both competed for the hand of 20 year old Victoria Winters. That would never be allowed in shows today because the PC police would come knocking. In the later years of the show, a contingent of moms forced the producers of Dark Shadows to eventually stop depicting Barnabas as constantly turning beautiful young women into vampires and ordering them around. Boys stopped running home from school to watch after that. The show was canceled in 1971 because it couldn't carry itself with just the traditional soap opera viewers who had been pressuring sponsors to make the show more pc (including less ""frightening"" to children). The last episode was supposedly written to appease moms who said their kids were having nightmares. The narrator says in the final moments of the great series that it was only an animal that bit Melanie (on the neck).

{Update: Wow, I remembered correctly that the name was Melanie. Here are the final lines from the great show: ""There was no vampire loose on the great estate. For the first time at Collinwood the marks on the neck were indeed those of an animal. Melanie soon recovered and went to live in Boston with her beloved Kendrick.""]

There was a 1991 remake series of Dark Shadows that was well done and DS fans should see that as well. They never made a second season of the show because the First Gulf War kept the viewership low. That was poor planning and I believe a bad decision on the part of the network.",1371600000,3,2876,4.638506876227898

5039531,5,B006Z7Z3KY,Absolutely love this!! Would have never believed they would ever have had my all time favorite series all in one special collection. I was thrilled to find it on amazon. I vividly remember rushing home from school to watch this along with my two sisters. It was the highlight of our day! Would definitely recommend this if you want a blast from the past!! Oh and the coffin box was a brilliant idea :),1368748800,3,401,4.4324324324324325

I watch this a little at a time, so it'll take me at least a year or two to get through all of the dvds, but it's great to finally have all the episodes.  I missed alot just watching them in pieces, nice to get this complete set.  Plus it's in a nice little package that fits right on the shelf on the entertainment center.  You must get this, especially if you are a Dark Shadows fan.  Even if you've never seen them, but like old shows or gothic shows, you'll love this and for the price, you're getting 5yrs worth of the show.  I wish they'd do this with Passions at least and other soap operas.  This one is a must have!!",1368662400,3,699,4.088235294117647
5039533,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Please buy this set from Amazon, if you buy it anywhere else for cheaper you're probably getting a CHINESE COUNTERFEIT like I did. I bought the set from Amazon after getting my money back for my counterfeit set and I couldn't be happier with it.

I bought this set from a seller on eBay for a song back in March, I should've wondered why I got it so cheap.
I knew something was wrong right off the bat.

Here are the tell-tale signs of the counterfeit Dark Shadows DVD set:

I confirmed ALL of these with MPI Home video.
1. This will tell you if your set is fake right away. The real DVDs are DUAL LAYER FORMAT. Meaning if your discs are all 4.35 GBs(single layer), THEY ARE FAKE. The real DVDs are 6 to 8 GBs and have a gold look to them.

2. The coffin box. It is very cheaply made and usually torn in spots, the coffin lid ""stopper"" or prop is not included on the counterfeit. Colors are very faded looking. The coffin box should not be shrink wrapped but encased in a special form-fitting cardboard box and the coffin box is also in a special plastic bag.

3. The actual DVD cases are very cheaply made and incredibly scuffed up. The real set has very nice, high quality cases.

4. Many of my DVDs had scuffing, scratching, and other marks. The Paint wasn't quite right on a lot of Discs.

5. The booklet is made of cheap quality paper and the printing is substandard at best.

You would never think a DVD set of this kind of complexity would not be counterfeited but the money is just to tempting for counterfeiters to resist. Any big ticket DVD or CD boxset can and will be counterfeited.
eBay refunded my money but I am out the return shipping. I took extensive pics of the counterfeit set for anyone interested.

I bought the real set here at Amazon shortly after and couldn't be happier with it. 5 stars all the way.",1367798400,60,1825,4.281976744186046

I watched this, back when I was in 7th and 8th grade and I can remember, rushing home from school, to watch this.
It brings back alot of memories and some very good actors and actresses.

I like the complete series.  Now I can watch this, whenever I want and it is so convenient to have all the episodes and I don't have to wait for Netflix to send me another dvd.

I like the dvd with the bloopers and it shows how some of the actors and actresses, look today.

A great gothic soap opera!!!  There should be more like this today.",1366588800,,616,4.1344537815126055
5039560,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I watched this show when I was little.  My mom LOVED it.  I didn't get all the story lines because I was too young to really get it.  Watching it now is like going back in time.  Before computers and cell phones.  Also, to see the FASHIONS that some on them wear.  So I get to remember MY childhood, and relive a time that was so different.  I also get to go back to 1795 with Victoria!  How great is THAT?!  It's also fun to see the times when they forget lines or nearly get hit on the head with the overhead microphone.  They are so good, they get through it like it never happened.  They didn't have the ability to have a ""redo"".  They had to keep going.  The interviews at the end of most disks are very interesting and give you an idea of how hard it was to do this, without having the ability to fix mistakes.  I'm watching it from the beginning and I'll probably watch it over and over.  I love it.
  ALSO, I recieved it in a VERY timely manner and it was packaged extremely well.  All the disks seem to work fine so far, it was in wonderful shape.  It's so cute in the big COFFIN box.  I'm glad it came with the booklet with info on each episode.  I try not to to read those because I want to be surprised.  Watching ""Dark Shadows"" is my escape.  I guess I'm addicted.  Oh well, there are worse things I could be addicted to!",1366502400,5,1334,4.042307692307692
5039561,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Had doubts about spending a little over $300 for this boxed set despite how many DVD's it has. Who wants a a flimsy made box? NOT THE CASE!
The coffin box it comes in is very well made. Not cheaply made like I expected. When it arrived it was so heavy and I had no idea why.. the box (even without the DVDs) is that sturdy & well made.

The DVD's themselves are the best quality you can get for a show recordered during it's time. I love the fact all the espiosides are numbered and each air date is listed with them on the DVD menu. The biggest help is the episode guide book that comes with it. If I'm not sure which episode I left off on I go to the guide to see the epiosde summarys on the disc I am on.

Not only worth the money for the well made box but your getting 132/133 DVDs which would normally go for (not on sale) betwen $20-$35 each. The last disc also include the bloopers/outakes dvd which is also a seperate buy normally from the other collections. All the interviews by cast & crew at the end of each disc is a treat as well.

To anyone contemplating or second guessing if it's worth the buy... if you got the money get it. I was skeptical about spending that amount but you are really getting what you pay for & more.",1366156800,12,1237,4.061475409836065

I don't watch soap operas but after seeing Episode 200?, the one where the graverobber opens up Barnabas' coffin, I was hooked.  I'm a sucker for a nice complete series collection and talked myself into purchasing it.  After multiple orders and subsequent cancellations I bit the bullet and stuck to my guns.

5039578,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I used to rush home from school with my sister to watch this show when I was younger.  My sister and I were hooked on it!  Recently a cable channel I subscribe to offered the Barnabus Collins episodes and though my initial reaction was...Wow! This show is campy and there are funny bloopers...that was quickly forgotten as I became HOOKED all over again!  It was so much fun watching it anew and reacquainting myself with the characters I loved as a young girl.  I got caught up in the mystery of what was in the basement at Collinwood?  Would Maggie Evans escape Barnabus' clutches?  Would Barnabus succeed in recreating his Josette in the kidnapped or hypnotized girls he fixated on?  And why, really, did Josette throw herself off Widow's Peak?

I found myself once more eagerly rushing home to watch on cable the next available episode.  My fun was halted, however, when the episodes offered through cable ended mid-stream, leaving me hanging.  I wanted resolution.  Plus I had a strong desire to see the early episodes prior to Barnabus' mayhem.  What ghosts had David seen in the Old House?  Why had his mother tried to kill him?  I also wanted to see the vintage very first episode of when Victoria initially came to Collinwood.

Needless to say, I was thrilled when I saw the COMPLETE original series offered by Amazon!  Like an addict, I am happily watching the full story.  Who knew there was such a kicker of a back-story BEFORE Barnabus arrived on the scene?  Burke Devlin, is my favorite scoundrel and crusador for the underdog.  He nearly rates up there with Barnabus who I feel has not lost one ounce of the charm that captivated me when the show first aired in 1966.

When my set arrived, I was surprised by how heavy and large the coffin is that cleverly houses the DVD set.  Inside, Jonathan Frid's prone and ghoulish form is a nice touch.  I find the episode outline helpful and the added photos a plus. Thank you, Amazon, for making my dreams come true!  I would highly recommend this set. :)  Mae Meats",1365465600,2,2023,4.602240896358543

Yes a little, but look at what all you get!  All of Dark Shadows, literally all of it in a coffin no less, you can't get cooler than that!  You just can't.  This product was a secret we kept from him for months!  We bought it super early, knowing full well, this is Christmas, and kept if from him up till that day and oh!  How his face lit up when he saw this, amazing!  Also I have bought things for friends before they see me get something this cool and say, my parent would love this too, can you get me one and I'll get you back, so I ended up buying two of these, one for my Father and one for a good friend's Mother, who was also a huge fan.  From what I'm told she went completely nuts when she got to open her present...Fun stuff!  If you ain't got a lot of money I can see where this might be a bit much, I sympathize, but man, it was so worth it for that look on my Dad's face.

Looking at it from a much different perspective with my ""older"" eyes than my teenage ones. Well worth buying instead of trying to rent it piecemeal & have episodes missing or damaged. You have to watch this show from the beginning. Everyone in this show is unique & original. Not cookie cutter characters who are interchangeable & could be played by someone else.

When I opened the coffin, I marveled at the cases which are layered to show Barnabas inside the coffin. Very nice. However, am I the only one who is not happy with the way the cases are arranged? I grabbed the first case at the top and noticed it was discs 127-131. Seriously? Disc one is on the very bottom? They are not in slots so when you go to take the bottom one out, the rest slide downwards. Maybe , I'm just being too picky but I think they should have been srranged the other way with disc one at the top. Because I feel like this is going to be a bit of pain in watching the series all at once, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Had the discs been arranged differently, I would have given the boxset 5 stars and described it as perfect. I am actually dreading taking all those cases out to watch it.

5039605,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Dark Shadows was telecast to spellbound audiences in the United States and Canada from 1966 to 1971. What made the original Dark Shadows such a classic that draws people to it like ants to sugar? Is it the strong storyline conceived by Dan Curtis or is it the brilliance of Jonathan Frid (the one and only Barnabas) or is it the foreboding gloom that perpetually hangs over Collinwood? I would say all of these and more - including strong acting by Nancy Barrett (Carolyn Collins), Louis Edmonds (Roger Collins), Joan Bennett (Elizabeth Collins Stoddard) and of course the genius Dennis Patrick (Jason McGuire). The story builds gradually from the arrival of Victoria Winters to Collinsport and several episodes later, the tension builds when Willie Loomis breaks into the Collins family  crypt at the Eagle Hill cemetery to steal buried treasure, but to his horror sets free entombed vampire Barnabas Collins. I would be letting out a lot of secrets if I went into more details, but needless to say, I loved EVERY single episode that I watched. I'm still working my way through the DVD collection, which will stay with me forever. I cherish it as one of my treasured possessions and fully anticipate watching it for years to come.

For anyone looking for a taste of Dark Shadows, search on YouTube for ""Which Is More Righteous Dark Shadows"". This is a small fragment captured from episode # 263 (my most favorite episode of all) where Barnabas and Mr. McGuire trade insults in a gentlemanly manner. I can't believe how much I adore this episode. The quality of English used during the entire series is wonderful compared to the garbage that is available today. I adore the original Dark Shadows, and the 1991 remake with Ben Cross as Barnabas is also very well made.

Buy this if you are a Dark Shadows fan. Jonathan Frid, Dennis Patrick, Joan Bennett and Louis Edmonds, the original stalwarts are gone, but a piece of them will forever remain on this marvelous TV series - the brainchild of the brilliant Dan Curtis.",1362700800,3,2018,4.793103448275862

When Barnabas first appeared on the show, he was definely a scary vampire, and not very loved, but he became so much more as the show progressed and we all loved him and were rooting for him as he was outwitting Angelique! Jonathan Frid was terrific as a vampire scorned and so funny at times. The price for the DVD set is soooo expensive, but you get all of the tv shows which there were a lot of - 1,225 episodes!

5039619,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"My Mother is an Original Dark Shadows Fan, and she'd been talking about it long before the Burton film was announced. Being a child of the new generation, I had no idea what she was talking about, however I have since immersed myself into the world of DS and found that I love it. I knew how much she loved the show, so when I found out the *entire* series was out for sale, I ran to Amazon. The look on her face was priceless when she opened it in December; it was probably the best Birthday/Christmas present ever! We've been watching it at home ever since then, and we love it!

The DVDs play very well, and have beautifully designed interactive menus. Sometimes there are hiccups in playback, but it is due to the Master Tapes (which the series was shot and saved on) being damaged in some way. You can't fault the tapes too much as they are very old, but there's usually a warning before some episodes to explain what happened; sometimes they even tell you an episode is missing, and it is presented in black and white with an odd, tinny sound when people talk. There's actually one episode, unfortunately,  that the entire footage was lost on, but I have no idea which one it is. I heard that the audio was saved, so they combined that with still photos to 'show' it. There are extras on the DVDs after you've gone through all the episodes in a set, such as the interviews. The interviews are very fun to watch; cast and crew review behind the scenes bloopers and mayhem that would occur on a regular basis during the taping of the show (some more outlandish than others).

We're about half-way through the series, but there's a lot more to go until the final episode. Until then, we will sit on the edge of our seats in suspense! I highly recommend this product and seller to any Dark Shadows Fans (new and old) who are toying with the idea of purchasing the series.

5039620,1,B006Z7Z3KY,"OK...I have now ordered this set twice!!!

Both times the item was listed as 'brand new'.

However, both times, the product that I received was either a 'repackaged' set or a very poorly quality controlled product.

*The bottom corner of the 'coffin lid' top was split/torn.

*The outer case is very scuffed.

* The dvd cases were all scuffed.

* Many dvds had scuffing, scratching and other marks.

* The 'autographed' card of Jonathan Frid was missing (which I see here wasn't included in subsequent releases of the set).

However, card notwithstanding...I am extremely disappointed with the overall quality of the product that I have now received twice.

Am I just having bad luck here...or are others experiencing the same problem?

I sincerely hope that my experiences were anomalies and that other purchasers have recieved a good quality product...though the fact that this has now happened to me two times in a row...has me thinking that the manufacturers are taking advantage of the fact that people have been clamoring for a comprehensive 'Dark Shadows' release and don't care if they are releasing a shoddy product.

I know I have been waiting for a set like this for ages...and the price seems a bargain...considering that this is indeed the complete series collection.

Nevertheless...even at this price...I wouldn't expect a 'new' product to have badly scuffed cases and scuffed/scratched discs!!!! That is not acceptable.

If one receives a set in good condition...then it would definitely be a worthwhile purchase.

However, I have now received a very flawed product twice in a row...from two different vendors...which raises serious quality control issues.

I am afraid to 'keep' the set...in case I get halfway through (there are over 1000 episodes you know!!!) only to find that some discs are skipping or have other playback issues...which considering the state that they arrived in...seems very likely.

I don't enjoy writing 'negative' reviews...but this has proved a very disappointing experience for me.

I sincerely hope that others have fared better with this product.",1361577600,28,2093,5.2
5039621,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I picked this set up as a Chrstmas present for my wife who absolutely loves this show, and horror, in general. Needless to say, she was ecstatic. I used to watch this show when I was a kid in the 60s on our black and white TV and it was a riveting show. It's fantastic to finally have the entire series in one set - the bonus features are nice as well. Something to sink your teeth into on those gloomy, rainy days...",1361145600,4,417,4.036144578313253
5039622,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Now I was a kid when the program aired on television. I will add that I am only a couple months older than the boy who played David Collins. Now the reader knows around how old I am.

As a kid I did watch Dark Shadows but I did not catch the beginning. Also I would miss episodes and somewhere along the way I stopped watching the program. I just happened to be scanning Amazon and saw this item. I read some of the reviews and decided that I had to have this item. I wanted to see what all I have missed so I ordered it. Now what I have is not the numbered limited edition. By the time I got to it all the limited editions were sold out.

I received the item September 2012 and I have not finished watching all the discs. Right now I am only up to episode 100 and I'm certain at the rate I'm going it will take years before I watch all the discs. Where I'm at now Barnabas Collins is not yet on the scene. I am looking forward to when he does arrive on the scene. Even now the story line is quite good with its twists and turns and yes even the appearance of ghosts. Right now I believe the ghost of a murdered man is working on getting its revenge.

Once again I did not get the numbered limited edition. I missed out. But I am not unhappy with what I got. I still got the coffin shaped container with the outline of Barnabas Collins. I did get the enclosed booklet but not the autographed photo. Also the discs are in plastic and are held by plastic. So far I have not had any problems. One must remember that the series was filmed during the mid 1960's. So there may be glitches that the discs did pick up

Once again Amazon did it's usual good job in getting the item to me in a timely manner. I used the free Super Saver shipping and had this item along with other items I ordered in a manner of days. Also the packaging was excellent. Again good job.",1360886400,2,1857,4.024390243902439
5039623,5,B006Z7Z3KY,So glad this was on sale.  We are watching it from the beginning and having a great time remembering the series.,1360368000,,112,4.333333333333333
5039624,5,B006Z7Z3KY,This exceeded my expectations. I loved this series and was so excited to get it all in one complete set.  Love the packaging...what a great concept.  A must for any Dark Shadows Fan!,1360022400,,182,4.484848484848484
5039625,5,B006Z7Z3KY,every episode!!! i was a fan way back then. forgot how good it was. loving every minute of it.  yea!!!,1359504000,,102,4.1
5039636,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"To say that this set is big is the understatement of the year-Massive is the word-or maybe giant? I would say that this set belongs in the guiness book of world records as the the largest box set ever made. I recieved my set in mint condition-in a box in a box. Once I opened the second box and removed all of the packaging-there it was-in all it's glory right before my eyes the coffin shaped box. I could barely contain my excitment!

Though I was only less than two years old when Dark Shadows began in 1966, I watched it in re-runs and online-but not all of the episodes. I always wanted to get the dvds-but they released it in seperate sets-and to get all of them would have cost way to much. So I waited. Then when I saw an announcement on TVshowsondvd.com that MPI was releasing the whole series in one massive set-I was very excited! I waited even longer when the price came down-and it did.

Housed on 131 discs-in 22 cases. The series itself is on 126 discs, the last 5(127-131)are special features discs which has a running time of over 20 hours! As if that wasn't enough-there are special features spread out on 126 discs-mostly interviews with cast and crew. What I saw so far has been very enlightening. There are 6 discs in each case(Except for the last one which has 5)There are an average of 9 episodes on each disc-and each disc is just over 3 hours each-each episode is 21-22 minutes each.

I haven't as of this this date reach the arrival of Barnabas Colins yet. I'm still in the first year. I love the gothic atmosphere The mysteries-the conflitct between Burke Delvin and the Colins family-Even David Colins-he is a devious child whose father hates and he hates his father. Yet he still manages to be likeable-though I felt he should have recieved a whipping or two!

I'm liking what I'm seeing so far-I will update this review after I see the whole series-which will be a while.",1359244800,6,1901,4.454022988505747
5039637,5,B006Z7Z3KY,Item received exactly as described with fast shipping. My purchase was not part of the first release so no autographed picture of Jonathan Frid but that's ok. The DVD set is just awesome and the bonus material extras outstanding. It's neat seeing the slate board before each episode showing VTR and air dates. Outstanding job done by MPI home video.

5039638,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"As a longtime fan of the show, I eyed this set for a long time. When Amazon put it on sale (as they occasionally do), I bit the bullet and forked over the cash - STILL a lot at half-price. I can honestly say this is one of the best presents I've ever given myself, and worth EVERY penny. The set is beautiful - contains every ghoulish episode, the quality is fine. Handy booklet with episode summaries tempts me to peek ahead, but I try not to ;-) Extra material on many disks is especially wonderful - insightful interviews with cast and crew. Great nostalgic fun, yes, but remarkably engaging all these decades later. My partner who never watched it as a kid is enjoying it just as much as I am. Hours upon hours upon hours of entertainment. My thanks to the producers and Amazon for making it available. Kudos to Johnny Depp, but...treat yourself to the one and only, original Dark Shadows. You'll be glad you did!",1358985600,2,917,4.431952662721893

It's fun to see the early ones without the Barnabas character - and it's all wrapped up in a schnazzy coffin-shaped box. There are loads of extras too - interviews, Behind the Scenes, etc. For the true fan, this is a great keepsake - looks wonderful on my cocktail table!",1358640000,2,412,4.657534246575342

I, like many kids watched the show after school in New Jersey, I moved to Scotland with my parents after Dark Shadows finished in 1971 and never forgot this fantastic show. I was a bit concerned about the boxed set coming such a long way to Scotland but it arrived in beautiful condition and I had to pay  160 dollars customs tax before the post office would deliver it to me!  All the discs work fine so far although I tried out the bonus discs at the end and disc 130 refuses to play saying it is the wrong region code.

5039659,5,B006Z7Z3KY,Let me start by saying I was 1 of those kids who ran home from school to watch it...... I was new to this world only a few years old..... However I watch it much differently today. The stars must have been alined to come together to create this masterpiece.... With so much trash on television today it's amazing that this series ever got produced. Dan Curtis and his staff are genius. All of the actors who acted in this are brilliant. Every time I put a disc in it's like watching live theater. The actors came from great acting schools the writers were some of the best of the time.... I hate single Specific actors ;however I'm going to do it with Joan Bennett (Watch 1 of her earlier movies and you'll know what I mean) She's the epitome of class and sophistication; She never throws a scene away never wastes 1 word.... She's old Hollywood at its best. The beginning part is a little bit boring however it sets up the bases for the entire series. When I was young I grew up in a house like Dark shadows however without all the monsters and goblins. My aunts uncles cousins parents were all like the people on the show Sophisticated and melodramatic It was A wonderfully interesting time in my life and I'll write a book about it someday. I believe it's why I like the show so much..... It's also I do believe the reason why I have an aversion to Knox on doors and telephone rings on TVs. Lol.... My favorite character in the series is Clarisse Blackburn( Missus Johnson) Something so freakishly unusual about her...Everytime she comes on It is really amazing that a show like this ever got made in the first place... And it's been copied so many different ways in so many different TV series in so many different areas of life. At first I didn't think I'd like when they went back in time however it's done expertly.... I loved it I'm about 3 quarters of the way through and as soon as I'm done add little bit on to the review. I can't wait to watch it again. 1 suggestion to any new buyers of this complete series is when you get it at home open it up and look through every single. Folder and make sure all discs are intact.... This way you won't have any problems in the future. Whomever by this I think you'll be pleasantly pleased ibeing a fan of the series and of the era itself; Well I've got to get back to my newest obsession( Somewhere  in the back of my mind I can hear my mom saying get away from the TV and go do your homework; And for goodness sake get ready for dinner!!!!) Now a days though I can sit back and just watch away... Knowing that the reality of life is to live in the present and not worry about the past and there's nothing you can do about the future.,1357603200,2,2687,4.258317025440313

I didn't see very many episodes, but when  I saw that Nexflix was showing some of them, I watched and was again hooked.  I debated whether I wanted to spend this kind of money, but I'm so glad that I did.

I've watched a lot of episodes, and still have many more to go.  Anyone who is a fan will absolutely love this.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.",1357430400,2,442,3.9101123595505616

Was watching on Netflix from the episode #210 (Barnabas Collins entrance to the series) when suddenly the episodes ran out. I panicked, as it was at a really interesting juncture in the story and immediately began looking for alternative possibilities online, such as the next group or two in the ""collections"". I ran into Amazon's offering and had a moment of overwhelming gratitude and joy. It happened on the one day there was a huge discount being offered! Placed it in my cart and waited for the husband to return so I could beg to purchase. He came home quite late, but by 11pm this excellently put together deluxe edition was winging it's way to me. Have no regrets, only continuing anticipation with each unfolding episode. This has also allowed me to experience the story as it led up to Barnabas' joining, explaining much that was assumed one should know, but having no possible means to from the Netflix availability.",1356912000,3,986,4.738372093023256

Kept item because I am a Dark Shadows fan.  Also it  was a gift from my husband and would have cost quite a bit to send it back.

My concern is that it came with a safety seal box but when mine arrived the safety seal had already been opened.  This kept bothering me, knowing that I had purchased a NEW item but that it had been tampered with.  I admit the actual series is great, what a compilation in 1 set and I really have regretted not simply replacing this.  I sent it back outside the return window and at first was charged a pretty hefty restock fee but once I explained my concern to Amazon they made it right.  This is why I keep buying from Amazon.  I plan to purchase this again when it has another special and hopefully I can be assured that it will be secure.  Many folks described confirming that all the disc were all in place.  Since it is such a large selection and will take a long time to watch these it is best to make sure the product is not defective, another reason for my concern.",1355616000,,992,4.23404255319149

The product (videos) itself I assume to be fine, but given the cost of this I would have like the case to be much more durable. My wife won't complain (it's a gift for her), but I hate to give her this with a cruddy case.

It is fun watching the boom mic shadow crossing the faces of the actors. the flubbed lines, and the melodrama with a gothic twist.  I have wanted  the series for decades and finally have it. You have to see it to believe it. Watch Joan Bennet blow her lines as all the actors eventually do because of the short period of time they get to learn them.
You also get the inside stories of the cast and how they worked together.  I have months to go before I see it all but I am enjoying a truly one of a kind show in the process.",1355184000,4,646,3.9461538461538463

I had seen the first 4 series on Netflix and I thought they were great.  I loved the black and white film which contributed to its eeriness.

I'm highly in love w/ this set! I was on cloud nine when I opened it up for my birthday!!

Oh, and although this set comes with a nice episode guide, it doesn't have Jonathan Frid's autographed picture. Still, I don't mind. I got to see the guy in person. :')",1353196800,4,654,4.533898305084746

For years, I have wanted to see the series again but no one was running it that I knew of.
Then one day Amazon sent me an e-mail about a one day sale of the ENTIRE series!!  WOW!  And marked way down!
Premium price for something I have always wanted!!!  I jumped on it and it arrived three days later!!  I have been watching episodes ever since in the evening!!
YAY!!
All the DVD's are packed in thier own little coffin!
One more thing off my want list!!!

5039745,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I purchased this DVD set at the Gold Box price, but it is definitely worth far more. The coffin container is solid, sturdy, and looks great. I like the way the sunlight makes the embossed lettering ""come to life."" The DVDs are in cases not cheap sleeves. Lots of interviews and easy to navigate from episode to episode. The booklet lists the episodes with a short summary, making it easy to keep track of the plot line. The interviews are interspersed throughout and are also listed.

I'm watching two episodes a night and enjoying the journey as much as I did as an 11-year-old girl all those years ago, only now I'm viewing the series at my leisure, on a bigger screen, and with a deeper appreciation of what an original show Dark Shadows was.

5039749,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I missed this when it first came out. My sister (12 years younger) told me a few years ago that if this series ever came out, she would give anything to have it. She said it was the only reason that she rushed home from school. I bought it for her in July and was so impressed with it that I bought it for myself when it was a ""Gold Box"" sale. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it. I'm very impressed with the quality of the videos and especially the packaging.

I'm 68 and, while I have not watched True Blood or Vampire Diaries, I like the dialogue and the stage production of this series. I understand that it was the first of its kind on soap opera tv. I've enjoyed reading all the nostalgic reviews here.

If you have never seen it, I suggest you watch some of it from Netflix or some other streaming device. The quality of the discs in this set  is much better on these digitalized DVDs. It is a little addictive and hard for me to just watch one episode at a time.

I highly recommend this series to anyone who loved it back then and any new comer like myself. Hope you  enjoy it as much I am.",1353110400,2,1101,4.102325581395349

5039756,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"When Dark Shadows initially was marketed on VHS and DVD, the first episodes were released last. In 1966-67, I watched Dark Shadows at a friend's house. The kids weren't supposed to be watching TV during daytime, but had a tutone white on gray 1958 GE 14"" portable black and white set hidden under a bed, which got pulled out for DS on WNAC channel 7, the Boston abc affiliate, before it switched to CBS, then NBC. When the show went color, the entire neighborhood landed daily at a home which had a color TV. The parents had bought a 10"" GE Portacolor for their bedroom, figuring size mattered, and the kids would watch the monsterous 1956 Raytheon 21"" b&w console in the living room. Wrong. A little color trumped a big black and white, and the family cat was named Quentin. I'm enjoying all the episodes now as much as I did back in the day. I still can't believe this serial exists in one complete set, which arrived in perfect condition at a 53% discount.",1351209600,3,959,4.454545454545454

There really isn't one storyline I didn't like though I will admit there are some I'm a bit more enthusiastic than others. With the arrival of vampire Barnabas Collins played to perfection by Jonathan Frid, the show really hits its stride.

A lot of great other performers are on here too including Joan Bennett, Grayson Hall, David Selby, John Karlen, Louis Edmonds, Thayer David, Nancy Barrett, and so on. They were all brilliant in the different roles they played.

For anyone who is a fan of the gothic and supernatural, this DVD set is a must.",1351209600,3,805,4.615384615384615
5039759,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I know that this show has been available for a while on DVD, but previously only in separate volume releases. With the number of episodes made for this show (1225) I have been waiting for a complete series set so I could get it all together. I got mine when Amazon had it on their gold box deal for $279.99. At .23 cent an episode this was a steal. I've looked through the discs and they are better quality than I expected for a show over 40 years old that was originally videotaped, not filmed. I'm glad they left the little bloopers and mistakes in these episodes because that was part of the charm of the show. It wasn't aired live, but it was videotaped live just like a play each episode. What you saw in the episode was how it was done. They left the bloopers in and kept on going. There are 131 discs, 126 of them with the episodes and 5 more with only bonus material. There are also interviews with surviving cast and crew on nearly every other disc in the set.
  I love the packaging that looks like a coffin and when you open it the DVD lined up and printed on the amaray spines looks like Barnabas Collins laying inside the coffin. I knew this was going to be a big set, but was surprised at the actual size and weight of it when I actually held it in my hands.
  I watched this when it was in reruns back in the 70s (I was only 4 when it went off the air during its original run) and I loved it as a kid. I just received my set a couple of days ago and I've only seen the first 20 episodes so far on this DVD set, but I'm hooked already.
  The set also comes with a small book describing the episodes and telling which episodes are on which discs. The book also lists the bonus materials that are on the discs. The episodes and bonus materials are also listed on the back of each amaray case.
  The only thing I didn't like was there were no subtitles or even closed-captions for the episodes, but the audio is good on the episodes so I haven't had problems hearing the dialogue.",1351123200,3,1991,4.126614987080103

Very cool display box for all the DVD's. Have seen all shows in re-runs and now I can re-run any time I want. Great show. The first vampire series on tv. Great cast and characters. Some stiff acting and missed lines, some flubs and bumps but was more or less live.
As a kid I ""ran home every day from school"" to watch. Played out the show with siblings.
Was never impressed by celebrity. No movie or sports stars. But if there were one person I could meet in person it would be ""Lara Parker"".",1351123200,2,649,4.241935483870968
5039763,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"When I first heard this set was to be released in the spring, I knew I had to have it.  The price, though, killed that dream.  The fact that it sold out didn't help either. I thought it would be something I'd get periodically, disc by disc for the next 50 years from Netflix.

I then saw that Amazon had the second ""printing"" for a cheaper price--but still more than I wanted to spend on a single purchase--I figured if I put a little aside it would be a Christmas present to myself.

Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I received the notice from Amazon that the set was the deal of the day.  At $279, I think I took a grand total of 5 nanoseconds to place the order.

Am I glad I did.  The package arrived two days earlier than the estimated delivery date.  The coffin was securely packaged in the mailing carton and well protected by a plastic cover. (I know another buyer had a problem with the packaging and damaged discs--my package came from the same warehouse and thus far the discs have played well and the packaging was excellent.)

I recommend this set for any fan, old or new.  I first became a fan of the Dark Shadows Revival in 1991, and when my cable company added the Sci-Fi Channel in 1996, I finally got to see a few episodes of the original and became hooked and thanks to this excellent set I can relish every minute of Dark Shadows.

A side note:  When the mailman delivered the packaged he commented that he saw ""Dark Shadows Coffin"" on the box and asked what it was.  After I explained he kept saying ""COOL! I loved that show.  I used to run home after school so I wouldn't miss an episode.""

Hope he ordered one.

Kudos to Amazon for offering this set at a more affordable price!",1351036800,6,1703,4.275

When it arrived I was speechless - amazing packaging, way more than I expected.  I was one of those kids who used to rush home after school each day to watch it on TV.  So happy I now have the entire series to watch whenever I want.  And to the few who gave this one star.... tsk tsk.

5039775,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"This set is sooooo amazing!! I would give it a 6th star if possible! The coffin is huge. Yes, it is made out of cardboard, covered with paper. It is not indestructible. If you were to open and close it hundreds of times it would show wear. It is not a tin. It has 2 metal hinges for the coffin top and is also held on with a BLACK ribbon (not white). The words DARK SHADOWS are in red foil. Even at $400, with 131 discs, they are in the vicinity of only $3.00 each!! The fantastic coffin is just an added bonus! If your not going to watch any discs for a while slip a nice clear plastic bag over it to keep it nice indefinitely. This show and the memories of it mean the world to me so I am extremely pleased with it. Luckily I never bought any sets in the past, just rented them and I won a $50.00 Amazon gift card 2 days before the Gold Box deal, so this was the ""perfect storm"" for me!! I am thrilled with it!! If you ran home after school and watched this like I did you will love this set! HIGHLY recommended!!",1350864000,3,1015,3.9560975609756097
5039776,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I have been considering buying this for months but the price was daunting. However it was the Amazon deal of the day this week at a considerable discount ($279), so I finally pulled the trigger. I was still a little leery about spending so much money until the set arrived. I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews about damage during shaping, but it was very well packed in a thick, stiff box conformed to the coffin shape. That box was packed by Amazon in a larger box and well cushioned with packing material.  The coffin itself was further protected in a plastic bag. So mine was in perfect shape. The coffin is quite nice and well constructed of sturdy cardboard with metal hinges. It is larger, heavier and more solid than I expected. The DVDs are in perfect shape and none had come loose during shipping.

I have only watched the first 5 episodes, but the quality is better than I expected for such an old show shot on videotape. The production values (camera, lighting, music, etc) are also better than I expected.  I am hooked.

To sum up, I don't regret this purchase at all. It is well worth the price I paid and I have probably a year or more worth of material to watch. If you are leery of the price, keep an eye on the amazon deal, it will probably come up again.",1350518400,10,1292,4.348547717842323

5039779,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Dark Shadows was a series created in time when theatre and storytelling was essential to carry a show.

Wonderful cast of characters and actors that bring them to life!!!

Granted the special effects are nothing like we see today but when you think that these effects had to be pulled off on cue and done right on the first take (as there was no second chance since it was done live-to-tape) it is absolutely amazing. Dan Curtis and his team were quite ingenious and pioneered several of these effects for the use on live tv. It does not distract from the story at all and instead draws you further in to see what will happen next.

I did not grow up watching this series as I am only 32, but my parents did and I am fortunate to have a love for this show passed down to me. My mom purchased this for me as a gift and I am so glad she did. The show has been remastered as best as it could be from the original master tapes and it looks great. The special features are awesome and I love watching the interviews at the end of each disk with the cast and crew from the show.

This set is well worth the price!!! If you have not bought it yet then you are missing out!!! This is a must have for any Dark Shadows fan!!!",1349654400,4,1215,4.092436974789916

5039781,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I'm still just in awe of this set.  And as someone who bought several of the VHS releases back in the 90's, I'm thrilled to see all the various compilations (Best of Barnabus, Scariest Moments, Music Videos, etc.) that are good for a quick fix of Dark Shadows when you don't have all day.  Out of the mind-boggling 131 discs here, 5 are devoted to such bonus materials.

As for A/V quality, these are the same exact episode releases previously put out by MPI in 4-disc collections (just re-labeled ""the complete series"").  As such, they are mostly very good, although you should be aware that several episodes have some bad spots that apparently could not be corrected without editing the material.  MPI is up-front about this in the liner notes, telling the viewer exactly which episodes this includes, and the reason for choosing to include them in their entirety, warts and all.  The booklet included also gives brief synopses for all the episodes--over 1200 in all!

If you're a fan of the show, you really should take the plunge and get this one.  Sure, it's a lot of money for a single purchase, but it's still hundreds of dollars cheaper than buying the previously-offered sets.  I'm currently managing to watch 2 or 3 episodes a day; at that rate, it will still take me 1 1/2 to 2 years to get thru it all!",1348617600,4,1314,4.581196581196581

What I will never understand is why ABC took the show off.

And it is sad that we don't have script writers today that can captivate and scare the audience without a lot of gore and special effects. Surely someone can write a new Dark Shadows that works. It doesn't get any better than this.",1345161600,14,496,4.5

I am looking forward to many hours of viewing delight.  I was a bit embarrassed to tell my husband about this purchase, but he was charmed by the coffin packaging and the details as I described to him.  I think I will have a Dark Shadows convert here.

5039799,3,B006Z7Z3KY,"The selling factor of this was not just the complete set itself, but the coffin display case it was packaged in.  However, after receiving it, I was highly disappointed to find that it was merely a cardboard construct, torn and split in several places, particularly on the lid. Granted, I could have returned it, but I didn't want to risk something else happening to it in transit, potentially getting another one in the same condition, not to mention having a $400+ purchase in limbo.  So I'll settle with some patchwork with black electrical tape and a sharpie to cover the damage.  Don't get your hopes up thinking this is a really greatly constructed case.  You might be better off finding one in a store so you can examine the purchase first.",1343952000,15,747,4.679389312977099
5039800,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I'll bet right now those of you who passed up on the pre-orders or early purchases are kicking yourselves repeatedly in the butt. This set is just too huge to write a justifiable review. So I'll just give an overview. Judging by what the disc menus say this seems to be just a repackaging of the previous sets. That part may cause some anger if you already bought those sets. But, for people like me who didn't this is a terrific deal. I'm on disc 30 so far and I have to report I am thoroughly pleased. The picture and sound quality are very good. There is no subtitles or closed captions. Normally that would bother me, but for some reason having those features unavailable seems to add to the authenticty of going back to the time when this series first aired. Wanna increase that experience? Watch the episodes on a glass tube tv, if you have one. In fact the picture quality is upgraded on a glass tube tv. I know for many it would seem too much to sit through 209 episodes before Barnabas Collins finally arrives, but you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't watch them. The early stories are very good and certainly worth watching. I must admit I really enjoyed the chalkboard slatings that started the ""Beginning"" episodes that were omitted when Barnabas arrived. I wish they continued that. Jonathan Frid's Barnabas comes across as a charming Peter Cushing when he's sociable and polite, and as a stern Boris Karloff when he has been crossed (as in betrayed not threatened with a crucifix, actually I don't even know if that aspect is part of the Dark Shadows lore). I can most assuredly say this though, Barnabas Collins' first appearance has his back to the camera for almost a minute. And in that moment Jonathan Frid emanates more class, charm, charisma, and sophistication than Johnny Depp can ever possibly dream of doing in the entire Dark Shadows movie.",1343606400,15,1884,4.626865671641791
5039801,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I remember watching Dark Shadows when I was a kid. I don't remember much, just some characters. I bought the collection where Barnabas first arrives. I saw the 40 episodes and boy I was hooked. So I figure I'll get the entire collection. I figured that my birthday is coming  up so I might as well buy the whole set as a birthday present for myself. If I were to buy each volume it would cost much more. I got the collection and at first I was thinking of not keeping the case coffin because of its size. It takes lots of space. But some friends of mine thought I should keep the case because its a very impressive part of the set. So I keep the case in a cabinet and I just take out the DVDs that I need to watch. The case coffin is not that cheaply made it holds the DVDs plus the Episode guide booklet very well. Now I'm watching Dark Shadows from its begining before Barnabas. The storyline is very intriguing and you always want to keep watching episode after episode. I watch two episodes per day, but now that I'm on vacation I'm having Dark Shadows marathons. There only 20 mins long so the episodes go quick. I'm enjoying the episodes very much. The last volume is full of lots of Dark Shadow featurettes and reunions and lots of fun xtras. I Don't think any fan of Dark Shadows will be disappointed.",1343433600,5,1309,4.257028112449799
5039802,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I received my package on Saturday July 14 and was so excited. I opened it up and there was the coffin. I was so nervous when I took out the first DVD case. I looked at the number on the disk and there was disk #1. I thought about putting it in my player and beginning my journey but decided to wait and count the discs and make sure all of them were there. How thrilled I was, when I got to the last case and found all the discs to be there and in perfect condition. This brings back memories of when I was in third grade. Back then we would get out of school at 3:00 PM and Dark Shadows would air at 3:30. I would ride the bus home and God save anyone who got between me and the television set. At some point Dark Shadows began airing at 3:00 and by the time I got home I might catch 10 minutes worth of the show. I can't tell you how grateful I am to have the complete set. I am already up to show # 71. This is the first time I have ever been able to watch the complete series. Thank you Amazon and MPI.",1343001600,7,1006,3.795238095238095

And it is much cheaper to buy this then to purchase the show any other way so it is a great deal. Go back to collinwood for 470 hours. The episode guide is very impressive as well. Plus buying this set is a great way to honor Jonathan Frid. I highly recommend this for any real dark shadows fan. .,1342656000,3,459,4.054945054945055
5039806,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"This Deluxe Dark Shadows DVD Edition surpassed my expectations. The multi-disk set arrived securely packed and on time. The coffin case is solidly built and much larger than anticipated. I haven't seen the series since it first aired in the 60's and after viewing the first three disks I was thrilled. The added bonus of these videos are the opening scene numbering each episode written in chalk. This show is vintage '60s.

The story lines and characters are fully developed and I never realized how much happened before Barnabus Collins arrived.

It is fascinating how the language has changed and this series offers a retrospective, nostalgic look back.

I feel blessed to have the opportunity to view this series twice and highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to touch bases with an exceptional television series.

This is the best purchase I have made in years.

PS In the 70s I met the late John Herbert ""Jonathan"" Frid (December 2, 1924 - April 14, 2012). He was so kind and gracious when I explained I was a fan, watched the series as a child and asked for an autograph.

The entire cast should be proud of their work and the wonderful legacy of Dark Shadows.",1342569600,4,1176,4.684466019417476

All I can say is WOW!  The art on the box and dvd's is wonderful!
I sat myself down and started to watch.  Boy did it bring back memories.
Thank you thank you for bringing this wonderful collection together.",1342483200,6,339,4.029850746268656
5039808,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"So far, so good! I was born in '73 so I missed this show the first time around. I'm 35 episodes in and already hooked.
MPI has done a great job with this set. Something I've found out to improve the picture quality a little more if you're watching these DVDs on an HD television is to turn the color off or to ""min"". I noticed that some slight artifacting produces small false color squares or blobs and they were a little distracting. Now, it's possible that it's my player or television that causes this (I notice it occasionally on many B+W DVDs).
  I think I'll take the next 20 days off and finish watching the series ;)",1342224000,6,625,4.288135593220339
5039809,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I wanted this dvd set as soon as I saw it, but couldn't afford to buy it. I had watched this show when I was 20 years old and absolutely had a big crush on Barnabas Collins. He was such a charming, well read, good looking vampire. Anyway, my kids knew how much I loved this show and my oldest son called and talked to my daughter, who then contacted my youngest son and they agreed to go together to buy this wonderful set for me. I had no idea until it arrived at my door. I was ecstatic. It is such a fabulous collection and the show was unique and unlike any of the other continuing dramas on tv. All our friends were watching and comparing notes and we all had our favorite characters. This set is so wonderfully presented and I won't rehash all the details, since others have already done so in their reviews.  I am just so happy to be the lucky recipient of such a treasured gift. I will enjoy watching all these episodes again.",1342051200,4,934,4.188888888888889
5039810,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I was so surprised when my set arrived on Saturday a few days ahead of today's official release date.  This must be seen to be believed.  I played around with the first few episodes and then I just couldn't stand it and had to watch episode 211's restoration.  This is where Barnabas makes his first appearance at Collinwood.  Pristine work. Thanks Jim Pierson. Per internet poster Andy McMinney, ""MPI and Jim Pierson had acclaimed video restorer Kevin Segura use his Live Feed process(which actually restores videotape quality depth to old kinescopes) on the kinescope covering the 'lost' finale from 211.  ...  Hard to believe that an old kinescope can be turned back to original video quality, but it has been done."" Yes I did view some color episodes and they are clear and sound great.

You would think with all of the excitement over the new movie, some network would have picked up the series to air on television.  The SciFi Network as it was known in December 2003, owned the exclusive rights to air the TV series and took it off the air, just two weeks before the final episodes would have aired.  Since no TV channel has carried the series in almost a decade, the DVD sets are even more desirable.  This way you don't have to put up with commercials or a network which doesn't believe in airing episodes during a holiday. There are so many fascinating bonus interviews, you will want to see them. Stories I have never heard before and some people connected with the original series I have never seen before with great information I wouldn't have ever known without their bonus interviews.  I can only tell you that once these latest sets are gone, you will pay through the nose for them on online auctions or through internet market places - unless MPI decides to make a few more.

Don't let your set get away. Order now!",1341878400,8,1832,4.62037037037037
5039811,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"This freakin' heavy package came and when I opened it I was appropriately startled. The coffin box holding the DVD's was huge and kinda creepy. It is the second 'non limited release' so I did not get a serial number or a card signed by Jonathan Frid but that was not why I purchased it. I wanted the full Dark Shadows' collection and I am thrilled. I started watching the first 5 episodes so I don't know if any of the DVDs are loose or cracked. I am just so happy to revisit my childhood when I rushed home from school to watch DS on a portable 12"" B/W tv in the basement. I see they are temporarily out of stock so I feel the same feeling the limited edition people felt when they received their orders. If you are a fan and esp. if you have memories watching show when it aired then you must get this collection. Also, the booklet summarizing each episode is wonderful. I'll post later if anything comes up regarding the DVD's.

-July 13 (Friday) Update: The older episodes show a chalk board with video recording and scheduled telecast date (usually 2wks span) One episode the man holding the slate made a joke and perhaps did not know they were recording. This answers my question if Dark Shadows was a ""live broadcast."" It was NOT! I am still loving this collection. No problems. I originally felt guilt for having indulged myself with this purchase but that is quickly abating. I LOVE this purchase more and more!

-July 24 Update: Moving through the episodes and I am finding the technical and acting errors and rough spots endearing. I am so glad I saw this soap in real time when it was first aired and now to revisit it via DVD viewing. I was so enthralled and scared watching it as a youngster in the late 60's and early 70's and now I can enjoy it on a different level as an adult. This is worth the monetary splurge esp if you are like me and have fond memories watching it when it was first telecast.",1341878400,5,1915,4.3314763231197775

Unfortunately there are missing discs.  What a disappointment considering how expensive this set is.  Amazon is apparently unable to replace discs #49 & #50 that where missing from the 'coffin'(episodes 453-462 & 463-472).  I received duplicate discs #53 & #54(episodes 493-502 & 503-512).  The box was also missing the packing slip.  I would call this poor quality control. I called cust serv and was told that Amazon is 'out of stock' so I'm unable to get the missing discs or return the duplicates without generating a completely new order. I've ordered from Amazon since 2000 and this ranks as my most bitter disappointment during this whole time.",1341878400,22,884,6.4491525423728815
5039813,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I could due without the ""Collectible"" aspects which inflate the price of the ""coffin"" set. I would be able to afford $100.00 installments (x4) spread out every other month as yearly/season sets of this, one of my all-time favorite TV shows, but they missed the mauseleum this time around. This economic fact, along with ""solid"" reliable packaging, which takes into affect the need for a safe but compact product packaging (customer space limitations due to a large DVD set) would have led to my being a satisfied ""buying"" customer on the complete series. Perhaps one day?  Also, announced today both films, House Of Dark Shadows & Night Of Dark Shadows, will be released on October 30th, 2012 as single releases for DVD & Blue Ray formats. Warner Brothers will publish, the SRP is $14.96 for each DVD, and pre-orders should start nationally on September 25th, 2012.

Intended to be Wuthering Hts drama, for about 200 episodes before a supernatural character takes over ... Namely Barnabus Collins the vampire. Then all bets are off, we get witches, werewolves, golems, phoenixes and ghosts galore. Surprisingly timely now that the period supernaturals (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies) are so hip... Curtis' original Dark Shadows is Delightfully low budget... And on mostly live daytime tv time constraints there are lots of mistakes... And why it rocks. When compared to the mind-numbing mediocrity of most on screen scenes the descriptions of Barnabas' hinted off-screen exploits are amazingly dynamic... Like the ransacking of the doctor's office to get Maggie's blood sample.

5039836,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I hadn't watched ""Dark Shadows"" since it was originally on the air. I was a preteen when it debuted. I, like millions of other kids, rushed home from school every day and plopped myself in front of a black and white TV to watch the show. I loved it back then but wondered if it would still hold my interest today. I saw the movie, which was OK, but the best thing about it was that it brought me back to the TV series. I purchased one of the 40-episode sets, and guess what? I fell in love with it all over again. As cast member Marie Wallace (Eve, Jenny Collins) states in an interview, ""Dark Shadows"" is true theater"". This is warts and all television. There is nothing like a videotaped series. It has an intimacy that cannot be achieved through film. Lots of closeups of actors, sometimes with their faces just a few inches apart while they are speaking. It is utterly fascinating stuff. The dialogue often will make you smile and sometimes laugh out loud, as it is delivered so sternly that it often comes across as funny. ""Dark Shadows"" is a joy to rediscover, or discover for the first time. Unique and tons of fun.",1341187200,6,1122,4.373205741626794

The behind the scenes interviews are very interesting, and make you appreciate the actors and their craft.  Imagine a show that was generally aired with just one take.  Yes, the mistakes are in there - but they just add charm to the series, rather like watching live theater.

5039843,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I am so beyond thrilled with this collection, but furious at how Amazon shipped it. I too watched the series in the 60's-70's. Unlike those who rushed home from school to watch, I rushed from elementary school to the neighboring nursery/pre-school I previously attended to watch (the Catholic nuns who ran the school watched it!). I had to wait there for my parents to pick me up after work (was 6 when the series began). They still remember if they arrived before 4:30, they would HAVE TO sit in the car to wait for DS to be over.

Anyway, my mother pre-ordered the collection for me, it arrived on April 11. Unfortunately she tried to make it even more special by having it ""gift wrapped"". What a joke! Amazon removed the coffin from its plastic bag, placed it in an UGLY blue canvas tote bag (THAT was the gift wrap), discarded all of the perfect original packaging. Placed the canvas bag in a box, padded only by inflated cellophane baggies. When it arrived, the baggies were popped, the coffin ripped in multiple places. I was sick. Called Amazon, and of course it was sold out. Had an RMA issued and immediately went to eBay to purchase it. Thankfully there were still a handful available.

Had to pay almost $100 more than the Amazon price, but not as bad as the next day when the prices had nearly tripled. (Of course, after our beloved Jonathan Frid passed, some were being sold for $1500-2000!!!) My ""replacement"" arrived on April 13, and I started watching an episode or two very late that night (technically the 14th). Sadly a few days later I found out that was the very evening Mr. Frid passed.

5039863,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I received number 999 of 2,500.  I was 11 years old when Dark Shadows premiered in 1966....the same year Batman premiered on television.  I don't recall watching it until Barnabas arrived and all the hype began.  This was the time before VCRs that were affordable and I like many others posting here have fond memories of running home from school to watch.  School would get out at 3:40PM, I would catch the school bus, and if lucky get home at 4:15 or 4:20PM to get to watch at least a little of the episode. In those days, here in Jacksonville, ABC was available on a UHF station that necessitated a converter box.  The picture was snowy but well worth it. My brother and I collected both bubble gum trading card sets and found all the cards that when assembled would produce a large picture of Barnabas...............reminicent of this current collection when all the DVD packages are lined up in the coffin.  The quality of the video is great for 1960's technology.  I have played the disks on my blue ray player and I believe the picture/sound quality has been enhanced by the upconverting process of my player.  I have begun watching the series from the beginning and I have no knowledge of these episodes and I have worked through the first 15 shows.  So far, I have found them quite boring and truthfully I can clearly see why Dark Shadows was on the verge of cancellation before Barnabas and all the other cast members we are familiar with began to show up.  I want to watch from the beginning but can someone please tell me if it is worth it or should I just jump to Barnabas premiere??  I am anxiously awaiting the movie with Johnny Depp.  I understand the need to attract the movie goers of today but I hope Burton hasn't butchered my beloved Dark Shadows.  I have preordered the soundtrack and Elfman has not disappointed.  I am confused though because the soundtrack is quite different from the presentations in the video clips all over the internet.  To conclude, yes the set is expensive but it is money well spent.  There are not many things I spend my hard earned money on these days that has given me such pleasure and joy as the money spent on this collection of my beloved Dark Shadows.  I am 57 now and watching brings me back to my youth and happier times.  Regards to all fans.........go see the movie........hope for a sequal to keep Curtis' and Frids' legacies alive.",1335052800,,2393,4.5514018691588785

I, for one, will not pay money to see my childhood afternoon escape be disrespected.  Either do a serious, scary as hell movie or leave it the hell alone!",1335052800,11,331,4.140625

5039879,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"For those who have been unable to see this Gothic Epic in it's glory, now is the best time to buy it.
The individual sets taken together at retail cost about $700 and don't come in the collectible coffin box.
It is indeed a hinged BOX and not a piece of cardboard and folded paper.

I have my limited edition signed postcard by Johnathan Frid and my timeline episode guide with it.
The DVD's are in THE BEST CONDITION in very high quality DVD cases.
The best choice made in the packaging was to NOT individually shrink wrap the entire collection.
The cases are not wrapped and that eliminates any potential for damage in opening 25 cases and lets you just get to the action!

I'd like to see the House of Dark Shadows and a restored Night of Dark Shadows remastered to Blu Ray disc, but the series will likely stay it's place on DVD for the longest time. I don't think there's the money to restore 1225 episodes strung out over BW and early Color work which are already in somewhat moderate quality stock to begin with.

These discs look as good as I personally expect and I am very pleased with the collection as it was conceived.
The disc are many times better than the copies on Netflix or other websites i've seen them on.
Very Nice!",1334534400,3,1237,4.369565217391305

Then Dark Shadows came on compact disk,but they were too expensive! I cried so much because I could not afford each set! So now Amazon offered the Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series(Linited Edition).but when it was offered there was no price listed,so I had to gamble to get the most beautiful,crafted, luxurious DVD set ever created! the coffin is marvelous and each DVD set ditto!

With a  whopping 134 discs, it comes in a boot size coffin and seems to be very sturdy.  It is not flimsy like some of the recent special releases from major studios.  I honestly don't know if i'll ever watch all 134 discs but it has its nostalgia place in my heart.  I remember watching DARK SHADOWS in my youth with my mother, and being completely captivated by its gothic location and supernatural storyline.

5039916,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"""Dark Shadows"", the classic gothic soap opera, originally aired on ABC Daytime Television from 1966 to 1971 ,and was created by Dan Curtis. Curtis would go on to direct both ""House of Dark Shadows"" ,and ""Night of Dark Shadows"" which unfortunately is not included in this set. Those movies I hear will be released by Warner Brothers in 2013. ""Night of Dark Shadows"" will include over 30 minutes of extra footage that was removed by the Studio before it was released to the general public in 1971. The Dark Shadows Box Set is a coffin which houses 131 DVD discs featuring the entire 6 year run of ""Dark Shadows"". The coffin is absolutely beautiful and I'm so lucky that I placed my order with Amazon before it sold out. My limited edition box set is #766 out of 2,500 and it also includes a hand signed autograph of Jonathan Frid who originated the role of Barnabas Collins, the reluctant vampire. By the way, my autograph was signed in silver sharpie. What makes this show so special for me was the great writing and acting that made ""Dark Shadows"" so believable despite the numerous bloopers that occurred on the set while filming the program. If you do not have this wonderful set, my advise is to order the Deluxe Edition without Jonathan Frid's autograph which will be released this July. You will not be disappointed.",1334102400,7,1321,4.64957264957265
5039917,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I received mine today - number 297 of 2500 - autograph in silver ink.  This was surprising since I missed the boat and did not order it from Amazon when it was first available.  I had started trading in movies to Amazon and then my son told me about this Limited Edition set coming out.  I was waiting until I traded in more movies so I could have more credit to apply to my order.  Ironically, one of the first movies I ever traded in to Amazon was Dark Shadows DVD Collection 1!  I traded it in because I figured I would never be able to afford the entire series buying it in those collections.  But then Amazon stopped taking pre-orders, so in a panic, I placed orders with Target and Best Buy.  Then Amazon began taking pre-orders again, so I jumped at the chance to order one from Amazon.  (Good thing because my Target order still has not shipped and I received an email from Best Buy today that says the item is backordered.  I doubt that either order will ever be fulfilled.)  I had almost $194.00 in trade-in credit and with the $24.00 refund I received today, it only cost me $196.00.  Not bad!

I grew up in the 60s so I was one of those that rushed in after school to watch Dark Shadows on a black and white tube TV with rabbit ears on top!  My grandmother loved it and my cousins and I would sit on the floor eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and watch it every afternoon.  Unfortunately, my dear grandmother passed away in 1970 while the series was still running.  Those of you who remember those days of black and white TV watching Dark Shadows and all those other wonderful shows will never forget those lazy, simple times.  Having this in my movie collection and being able to watch these shows will allow me to drift back to those times . . . at least for a little while.  Enjoy!",1334102400,4,1805,4.292899408284024

the show dark shadows was one of my moms favorite when she was a kid and when i was a teen she got some of the vhs collections and i liked it. a  few yrs ago i ordered a set from a collection website which turned out to be pirated copies of the collections which some of the discs were missing and or wrong show or wouldnt work at all. so i had to rent from netflix th eones that didn't work. but it took me about a yr to watch all 1225 episodes and i loved the show for the most part. the dieing days towards the end was kinda boring but the rest was fantastic. and i got this set at a bargin 263.99 with my 150 amazon credit so it was well worth it.",1334102400,3,1103,4.027397260273973

5039934,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Simply put, Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series is one of the finest television DVD releases available, and will easily be on the top releases for this year. This set is a labor of love by the good folks at MPI Home Video, and is the most affordable way to own the entire Dark Shadows collection. Every episode on 131 discs, in 22 single-width discs which, when aligned properly in the case, form Barnabas, asleep in the coffin-box. The set contains a high-quailty episode guide, and the Limited Edition of the set comes with a personally signed photograph/postcard of Barnabas (Jonathan Frid) - and is numbered out of 2,500 (mine is 386).

This is an amazing set, and although the Limited Edition is sold out, fans should not hesitate to scoop up the Deluxe Edition. This coffin-box is built solidly, and the DVDs are secured tight within their cases. My set was shipped with care, and no discs were dislodged. Be advised - if you have any question about the size of this set, be forewarned -- it weighs around 17 pounds and is very tall/wide. Be prepared to display this set - it will be hard to miss!

My only quibble with this release is the fact that the content on the discs have been released unchanged - what I'm referencing here is that the on-screen menu in each disc is the same as the previous series release and is numbered as such, not corresponding with the new artwork/packaging. This is a minor complaint, but with all the detail that MPI lavished upon this release, it seems like an odd aesthetic issue to ignore. This is a very small detail in the grand scope of this set, and should not slow anyone down from investing in a purchase.

The bottom line? Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series, in both its amazing Limited Edition and its Deluxe Edition reprinting, is an amazing set. This collection is not only an amazing archive of Dark Shadows, but a release that sets the standard for the care and artistry of home-video releases - and further cements my love for tangible sets, as opposed to digital media releases.

When considering there are 131 discs, even at the re-listed price, the set is still cheaper than if you bought the original volumes on DVD, even if you are tracking them down on the secondary markets.  The transfers aren't any different than previous releases, but the coffin box is spectacular!  A quality effort from MPI and outstanding service from Amazon.  Kudos!",1334016000,7,821,4.582191780821918
5039936,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"This perhaps is the most amazing DVD set that I have ever seen! I don't think anything the major studios put out will compare in quality or content. Being a fan of the series, it is an awesome set to own every episode among the special features, as well as the signed card. This is the Limited Edition version, only 2500 were made.

If you are looking here, you already know the story that went down with it and how it sold out quickly, which is why MPI went ahead and made a non-numbered version. Not sure if that will be limited, but I am hedging my guess it won't be around forever.

With the story of Victoria Winters who comes upon more family problems than anything that I could even compare, we get a delicious gothic unfolding of myths, occult, vampires, wolves and other spiritual phantoms of the night that will creep us out. Not to mention the strange secrets the family seems to have hidden away in their dusty home of Collinwood. With excellent story telling, deliberate pacing, and usually campy, but adoringly so, their acting comes across true in nature.

Dark Shadows is a one of a kind that won't be replicated by our current trends of culture and television and cinema (a hint at the upcoming film by Burton and Depp that is sure to strike fire in their eyes by the most ardent fans).

With that said, if you bought the set and are unpleased. Amazon is currently offering (as of this writing) to buy the set back at a grand amount of $2.50!! They are so generous. I'd be willing to double that if you are interested :)",1334016000,5,1537,4.401408450704225
5039937,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Hello Collinwood! I too ran home to watch DS after school when it originally aired and have rented some DVD's from Netflix in the past. But I've always wanted to own the complete series, when they announcened this set I preordered right away. I've been waiting for it to come out, and today is the day. UPS just showed up and I couldn't wait to open the box, man this thing is heavy but boy is it gorgeous! The pics don't do it justice. You have to see it in person to fully appreciate it. I opened the coffin lid and their laid Barnabas (I can't believe I just said that) sleeping. There are 22 DVD cases inside the coffin along with a nice thick episode booklet detailing ever episode and all bonus material. And also inside is the signed postcard fron Jonathan Frid. On the back of the coffin is a sticker detailing the contents of the coffin and your number of limited edition. I'm 1337 of 2500. Not a bad number to be in. All in all this set is worth every dime. Thank you MPI for all your hard work putting it together. I can't wait to start re-watching Dark Shadows from the beginning and reliving one of the best things from my childhood.",1334016000,6,1146,4.285714285714286

I got a FANTASTIC PRICE. I paid a total price of 362.03 (there was no tax or shipping. I went back to the site and now its 500 something. So glad I got it when I did.

Besides the giant posters of Barnabas in my room and pouring through Teen Magazines filled with articles, I must have written dozens of fan letters to the wonderful actors and actresses in the series.  What a time it was!

Like the other reviewer who watched on Netflix recently, being able to watch only 4 seasons left me hanging. So this boxed set is a dream come true.  Thank you so much MPI for making this available.  It is very much appreciated!  Stock up on popcorn and happy viewing everyone!",1333411200,13,617,4.464285714285714
5039955,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I watched this gothic soap opera when I was a kid and by far my favorite show. It is fantastic to watch them again. I was able to visit the set in 1968 and it was a thrill to see the sets, although it did ruin the allusion a bit. The stories were actually very well written and keep your interest. Naturally there is the high camp aspect to the show. Especially an over the top performance by Willy Lomas, Julie Hoffman,Barnabus Collins and the beautiful Angelique. Trust me you will enjoy this series if you have never seen them before.",1333238400,4,537,4.326732673267327

I watched the first 160 episodes on Netflix and left me hanging on whats next and I am on pins and needles! Thank You MPI and Amazon and all the Fans who took the time to put this together and writing reviews about this amazing collection. And to get Jonathan Frid's autograph is really a honor. What can I say..I am so excited! Take Care everyone and enjoy!!!

5039957,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I'm pleased to hear that MPI has heard our pleas for more of the boxset!!!  I have a question that goes out to those who have already received this boxset.  First, how is the quality in this release?  Obviously being shot on old film gives new technology a challenge in cleaning it up.  I have watched 4 collections on Netflix and the quality is as I remember it from the reruns.  There is a curious stream of lines that runs down the left side of the screen, at times.  It resembles that of tape lines.  Is this normal and is it present in the boxset releases?  Alot of the Netflix episodes jumped form Black and White to Color and back to Black and White.  Is this a normal thing and is present in the boxset release?  I thought maybe Netflix had been given a rougher batch than the DVD releases.  Also, I have a watched a few of the old release of collections on DVD, as well.  The quality isn't much different from Netflix.  Any input would be most appreciated before I sink my teeth into a 400 dollar commitment!  Thank you everyone!!",1332979200,2,1039,4.316062176165803
5039958,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"This review is being written on Saturday, April 7, 2012....three days before the official release date of Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Limited Edition)!

This is how I see it. With the 'Sign up to be notified when this item becomes available.' once again appearing on the item of Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Limited Edition)....this is what this means to me. The allotment of Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Limited Edition) is completely sold out of Amazon's inventory of this item with possibly a few set aside for damaged replacements. With April 10, 2012 being the release date....and with many or most of us scheduled to receive this item on its actual release date....my guess is the money will be deducted from our means of payment today or tomorrow which automatically changes the status of our order from 'Not Yet Shipped' to 'Shipping Soon' which means that your payment was successfully withdrawn. It would then be eligible to go into the shipping process which could mean that your item would be shipped today or tomorrow....with a two-day shipping turn-around. In some cases, the item might be sent on Monday with a one-day turn-around. Those without Amazon Prime Membership....I would almost bet that they would be in the same pool as the rest of us who do have Amazon Prime Membership. There may be an unfortunate circumstance where some of us might get a notice from Amazon letting a few who placed extremely late orders in the last few days who MAY receive E-Mails that Amazon took in too many orders and that their order could not be fulfilled....in which case, they may tell you that you could later place an order for Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)....which, by the way, is already listed on Amazon....because I think that when it appears again after this 'Sign up to be notified when this item becomes available.' notice is removed the NEXT time....the item will change to be the Deluxe Edition rather than the Limited Edition. I pray that all of us who actually ordered this Limited Edition before the second 'Sign up to be notified when this item becomes available.' DO receive the Limited Edition for which they paid for....and DO receive it this coming week.

I'd like some comments on what I've written....but mostly I'd like to know what status you are in for this item at this point....and when it changes to Shipping Soon....and Shipped....and even the estimated date of arrival....so that each of us can know what to expect. Be aware that if it says 'Shipping Soon'....you will have cause to rejoice in that your payment was successfully received and that you WILL be receiving the Limited Edition!

UPDATE: Immediately AFTER I composed this posting....I looked at my order....and it was like magic! My order now says SHIPPING SOON and then I looked at my means of payment....and, sure enough, my money had just been deducted by Amazon. Hoooooray! I wish you all the best of luck as well!",1332806400,2,2990,4.893491124260355
5039959,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I just got mine in the mail on friday, and I'll start by saying how great it is.  Its one thing to see photos but in person its even better. MPI did a wonderful job.  Well worth the money.  The disks are the same as before, but I've noticed that the 'beginning' no longer have these promos for other shows such as 'where the action is' or 'bewitched' over the closing credits.  I like it that way better. I love the theme more then hearing about other shows that were on when this aired.  I also want to note I tried each and every disc in the box (all 131) and they all work just fine! Barnabas is the man (or vampire)!",1332720000,6,620,4.049180327868853
5039960,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I was hoping to be #1 of 2500 but I wasn't even close.  That's the only real issue I have with this set.  The dimensions listed doesn't really give an idea of how big this set is until you have the big box in front of you.  The only other issue is that it would have been nice if the dvd menus would have been remastered to show a consistent menu for all discs with the correct disc number instead of the original disc label info from the original 32 sets.  The set was packaged well.  I only had one disc loose and it was undamaged because of the plastic casing.  Out of 131 discs, I only had 2 or 3 with slight scratches.  I scanned all the discs on my PC and there wasn't a bad disc in the bunch.  Which is impressive.",1332547200,15,721,3.9583333333333335
5039961,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Got my hands on this monster today (March 21, 2012) and I have to say it's even cooler than it looks in the promo photos!
Much has been written about Dark Shadows, it's cast, its strengths and weaknesses, and its place in television history. I won't bother regurgitating that information here. Suffice to say that I find it one of the most interesting, unique and compelling broadcast offerings ever, one that I have strong emotional ties with..
The discs in this Limited Edition set are the same as those released previously by MPI with the exception of the reinsertion of some previously omitted bloopers. To answer a previous question, I can find no closed-captioning.
Since many fans already own some or all of the 32 previously-released sets -- and since I obviously have not had time to watch these new discs yet -- I will restrict my initial review to the collector's packaging.
While listed at nearly 16 pounds, the box doesn't seem quite as heavy or as large as I had anticipated (although it's not light, either). Yet the coffin box seems pleasantly and surprisingly sturdy, as do the hinges connecting the lid to the box. The words ""Dark Shadows"" are scripted in red foil letters.
As illustrated in publicity photos, the spines of the 22 individual amaray cases combine to depict Barnabas Collins at rest in his coffin. The image is more detailed and striking than what appears in the photos. An awesome effect!
Looking at the photos, I had hoped that the inside lid of the coffin was made of quilted felt or velvet. Alas, it is merely a cardboard representation. It looks great anyway! The outside bottom of the box contains a sticker that tells a little about the set and a collector's number. Mine is No. 795 out of 2,500.
Each of the 22 amaray are the same: stark black with the words ""Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series"" in larger red letters on the cover. Underneath, written in white lettering, are the words Discs 1-6, Discs 7-12, etc. The back of each case has more detailed information on what episodes or special features are on each of the six discs inside.
Like the coffin box, the amaray cases are quite sturdy. Each snugly holds six discs. Time will tell, but I would say that the discs seem well-protected. Unlike the discs from the previous series, which had artwork on them, these discs are all similar to their cases: Jet black with red lettering (""Dark Shadows,"" ""Disc No. XXX,"" and ""Complete Original Series""). Everything is tied in so that you know you're dealing with a special set. The only downside is that if you ever have to replace a bad disc with one from the general sets it won't match the others. No big deal unless you're more interested in collecting than watching. Perhaps you can buy replacements from MPI?
The 22nd and final case includes five extra discs. Most have been sold separately elsewhere.
They are:
Special Programs and Compilations: (Scariest moments, a DS tribute, The Best of Barnabas, and a 25th Anniversary special)
Bloopers and Treasures: (Bloopers, outtakes, DS music videos, DS In Salem, Game Show Appearances, Promos and a commercial).
Featurettes and More: (The Making of Return To Collinwood, A Dan Curtis spot, a Joan Bennett Spot, a rehearsal from 1970 with Lara Parker, Promos with Jonathan Frid, etc.)
Special Edition: (DS ""Nightmares and Dreams,"" DS on location, Inside the Shadows, a Spanish episode, rare TV commercials and a photo gallery)
Dark Shadows reunion: (With interviews, promos, etc.)
Included in this set is a small booklet with a listing of the episodes on each disc and a one-paragraph summary of each. A small paper sheath holds a 4x6 picture card of Barnabas Collins (him standing next to his portrait in the Collinwood foyer) that is handed-signed by Jonathan Frid in permanent ink.
I have eagerly anticipated a complete box set of Dark Shadows for years. I breathlessly awaited its arrival since I first read about this collector's edition and ordered it more than six week ago (for $362, a fraction of what it costs for the 32 individual sets). Time will tell whether the discs are well-manufactured with a minimum of defects. But for now I am extremely pleased by what I see. From a presentation perspective this set is everything I imagined and more.
Great job MPI. And Thanks!

PS: My coffin box came in a plastic bag packed inside a sturdy cardboard shipping box with hollow cardboard buffers all around the inside. Very safely packaged. Since the inner-packaging so conforms to the coffin-shaped box -- and the outer packaging details what's inside -- I'm assuming they all come that way, no matter which seller you choose. It does say ""Made in China"" on the packing box.",1332288000,67,4678,4.803970223325062

It's great to see he's knit a group of DARK SHADOWS fans into a virtual ""Collins Family 2012.""

He must have been flooded with emails and comments from people, but, truly, he is the linchpin for all things COLLINWOOD, and deserves our thanks!

So, from me, thanks Terry. You made this as fun as a Christmas should be, and reawakened in me the best part of my childhood from 1966 - 1971 (years 6 - 11): The Dark Shadows Years. Given the fact that I was bedridden for two years during that span (1967 and 1970), at least I never had to rush home from school to see the show, and my parents were kind enough to pretty much let me have my way with a ""supernatural"" show given my unfortunate car accident and later discovery of scoliosis. I'd never have believed I'd be waiting for this day. Amazing.

And you made it all the more fun!

So, I'll be toasting all the residents of Collinsport later today, and I hope everyone waiting for the UPS delivery truck says a special thank you for getting this coffin delivered on time!

CHEERS ALL!
Especially you, Terry. This is a momentous occasion in the history of media and television, which will be noted even up to Syracuse University, Dan Curtis' alma mater.
Now, let's get this on iTunes!

Been tring to save the money to get this set cuz the original box sets would of cost over 1000 dollars. When I saw this set come up for $420 on Amazon I knew I had to start saving up for it... But because MPI made this a limited edition box set and only at 2000 units. They are now actually going to lose money instead of gaining. If they were goi9ng to sell more, more people would buy it... It's insane...",1331337600,23,514,4.0
5039965,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I stumbled across this four days ago, spent a few minutes thinking Wow that's a lot of money and then Wow that's a heck of a deal compared to what the previous series sets would set you back.  I ordered it then and glad I did since it now shows up as unavailable.  I was one of the kids who streaked home from school to watch Dark Shadows every day.  After a while I started audiotaping the show.  When the comic strip started, even though I live in Seattle I subscribed to a Detroit paper because they ran the sunday comic as a half-page (blindingly rare) and the daily strip in five column format, huge by today's standards and extremely rare even forty years ago.  Whoever was in control of the comic section on that paper was a very serious DS fan.  I actually talked to Dan Curtis in 1974 about reprinting the strip, but he said the rights were unavailable right then.  I spent 2&1/2 years taping every episode of DS off the Sci-fi channel onto digital VHS tape which held a place of honor in my collection until Dish downloaded a ""software update"" that instantly bricked both my DVHS recorders.  After that they were just paperweights.  Serious old guard fan here.  I don't know what method is used to divvy up how many sets each retailer is allowed to sell, maybe Amazon can talk MPI out of a bigger chuck of the press run, but I wouldn't want to bet on it.  They probably ran out first because they are the biggest dog on the block.  Everyplace else I checked still has it available, but that could change fast as Amazon buyers look elsewhere.  Fair warning.  Good luck.  ""EDIT"" - As of march 18th this is now sold out most places, but still shows as available at best buy, deep discount and amazon.ca, with best buy being the cheapest at the moment.  ""UPDATE"" March 22nd, if you haven't jumped in yet you can join ebates.com and get a $10 gift card to one of five different retailers, then follow their link to buy.com which has DS for $409.99.  Ebates gives a 5.5% rebate on movies bought at buy.com which would probably work on DS.",1331251200,4,2042,4.388297872340425

I have bought other complete series boxsets before, but none as cool as this one! The price, as we all know, is a steal and a bargain, no matter what some people say. The quality and presentation is amazing! Any DARK SHADOWS fan will be very satisfied with this, I promise you. Now that I have seen it, I know I would have kicked myself all the way to Collinwood, if I had not bought it. I got #595 and my Jonathan Frid autograph is in silver ink. I will be leaving this in my will to my daughter....I am not kidding. We started watching Dark Shadows when she was 6 years old... all day long (and into the night) on weekends -snuggled in bed, in the dark. We finished when she was 10 (it was slow going the first time because I was ordering vhs tapes ,20 at a time, when they went on sale for half price) When we finished the last episode, she turned to me and said, ""Mom, I don't remember the beginning anymore. Can we start over ?"" And we did, right then. It only took a year and a half to watch it that time.(no waiting on tapes to come) We have watched it all the way thru 3 times together and she's watched it all the way thru once by herself. I've watched it 3 times without her. She's a true Dark Shadows fan...like mother, like daughter !",1331164800,2,1360,4.097378277153558

5039969,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"today i received my Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Limited Edition) in the post and it only took 2 days getting here 2 belfast and words cannot express how impressive it is. any pictures you will see of this does not convey how big or beautiful it is and is really a work of art. never has there been in my experience a more beautiful looking box made for a television show. i sat for almost 2 hours making sure all the discs worked and am gald to report that they do. my box was #1102 and my autograph was signed in silver and is very nice. the box itself is made of the strongest possible cardboard and is wood like in strongness. the dvd cases themeselves are good quality and i have no dobut with the proper treatment applied will last a lifetime. the spines which make up the image of barnabas is a a very striking and vivid image with plenty of detail also which one needs to see in the flesh so to speak in order to properly examine the details. this boxset is also as a few people have pointed out extremely heavy and no wonder with it housing an amazing 131 dvd's. the five extra dvd's which are devoted entirely to special features are an amzing bonus and really gives one a lot of insight into the show and its stars and also not to mention the interviews with the stars which can be found on all the other 120 odd other dvd's. this set is brimming with specal features. i checked just to be sure in case some may be wondering to see if the blooper of bathia mapes was indeed included and can confirm that indeed it has which im sure might be a bit frustrating for the people who bought the individual boxsets and who may want this blooper. the booklet which is included is full of beautiful rare pictures and is great help in locating your favourite episodes and what special features are included on which dics as you can imagine you would not want to go through the whole 131 discs to find a certain interview.

overall this is the single most impressive and classy boxset of dvd's i have ever seen released and mpi has indeed gone the extra mile to ensure that fans of this show get the best quality item they could possibly offer for one of the most beloved shows ever. so i would like to thank them for this beautiful item and also amazon for great customer service on my behalf as i live in belfast ireland and it only took 2 days to deliver ... today i am one happy bunny

take care everyone and hope your enjoying your sets as much as i am

all the best

It just doesn't get any better than this!  The creator of ""True Blood,"" Alan Ball, was influenced by this show in his youth, as was Tim Burton, director of the 2012 ""Dark Shadows"" movie starring friend and fellow-DS fan Johnny Depp.

Before there was ""Twilight,"" ""Buffy,"" ""Angel,"" Anne Rice novels and all the rest, there was Barnabas Collins and ""Dark Shadows."" The original series has an energy and charm that gives it a special quality that can never be recaptured - plus wonderful performers with unique personalities.

5039972,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"i was hoping they were going to do something before the dark shadows movie and i couldn't have asked for anything more. i have been a fan since i was a kid, some 20 yrs. ago, watching it with my brother on a 12"" black and white tv with bunny ears. as a young child it kept me wanting more and i couldn't wait for the next episode. i believe its great for all ages with so many turns it truly is a classic soap. so its nice to have this series in one place and not take up a shelf in my dvd collection. i have been waiting for this for years but i wasn't going to buy what was out now, thinking possibly they would do seasons eventually but the whole series is even better and cheaper than buying however many sets are out now. as for the thought of blu-ray, in a way it would take away from how i felt as a kid watching it. don't get me wrong it would be great to have them remastered but at the price of basically $420 i would hate to think of what the blu-ray set would cost, so im ok that its not.

5039983,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"MPI just saved me a fortune! I have been buying the Dark Shadows DVD volumes, sporadically, since 2002. I have the first three ""Beginnings"" and nine volumes since Barnabas was introduced. I paid $25-$45 per volume. So it is clear to see, I had a lot more money to spend, before I had the complete set. With the complete series (in a single package) coming out in April, my quest for the entire set will be realized. And at a fraction of the cost! Thank You MPI!

7-16-12 I was sorry to hear of Jonathan Frid's passing on April 14, 2012. His legacy certainly lives on with this box set. The limited edition box set is everything I was hoping for and is now prominently displayed in my living room.
Here is a bit of intrigue. One of the reviews noted that Jonathan Frid's autograph in box set 2462 of 2500 was in red ink. My Jonathan Frid autograph from box set 445 of 2500 is in silver ink. Rest in Peace Jonathan, thank you for the memories!",1328832000,5,941,4.286516853932584
5039984,3,B006Z7Z3KY,"First, I am forever grateful to MPI for producing the entire series of Dark Shadows, initially in the VHS format, and now in the DVD format. It was a bold move to release an entire 5 year long soap! However, if this new complete series boxed set is going to give us the exact same quality as the previously issued DVD sets, I have to point out that starting with episode #442, which depicts the walling up of Rev. Trask by Barnabas, there are frequent and irritating loud sound glitches throughout many of the subsequent episodes. For those of you who have both the VHS and the DVD MPI products, compare them. Fast forward the VHS tape containing episode #442 to the scene when Trask is in the Old House drawing room and listen carefully to when he screams. Also, listen to when he screams towards the end of the episode when Barnabas forces him into the alcove. Then play the DVD version. You will hear a loud, hideous, echoing sound glitch which draws out both screams several seconds longer than the VHS! From then on, these sound glitches occur in later episodes, most often during the end-of-scene music ""stinger"". Now, regarding the bloopers. MPI is promoting the new set as including a blooper cut out when the DVDs were first produced. The blooper occurred in the episode where Bathia Mapes attempts to exorcise Barnabas. MPI does not mention that there were other bloopers cut out. I can point out one, an episode where Burke, Vicki and Julia are talking about the murder of Dave Woodard. Julia leaves the drawing room and Burke and Vicki continue talking. Then an off-screen sneeze can clearly be heard... on the VHS MPI tape only. This blooper was cut from the DVD release. There are several other bloopers cut also but fortunately, MPI got complaints from the fans and this practice of cutting the bloopers stopped. However, there are MANY of those above-mentioned sound glitches. My three star rating reflects not so much the product but MPI's failure to correct previous defects.",1328832000,18,1993,4.7298850574712645
5039985,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"""Dark Shadows"" was my ""Twilight"" growing up.  Like many other kids during this time, I would race home after school just to watch it.  My mom's soaps were over and my dad's programs yet to begin.  Barnabas Collins was my first on-screen crush-the ultimate bad boy-dark, intense, mysterious, brooding, romantic, misunderstood.  He was way before I came to know Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters, way before I heard and saw Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Phantom"".  I even had my own ""Barnabas"" ring that I wore just like he did. (Still have it, though it doesn't fit.)
Sometime during DS's second or third year, the television station decided to move DS to 10:00 AM and put a movie with ""Dialing for Dollars"".  Since this was before any kind of recorders, I didn't get to watch it after that.  Crushed is not the word to describe what I felt.  I missed out on a lot.  The station moved it back to it's original time slot about 6 months before it went off the air.  I've watched reruns on stations that have carried it and have some on Netflix but have never seen the entire series.

Right now, this is only on my wishlist b/c of the price-but will definitely buy later.",1328486400,3,1160,4.502392344497608
5039986,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Ok I forked over 1700 dollars to buy all the dvd volumes released by mpi. Not to mention the VHS collection that came out before dvds. Even so I am gonna buy this set too. You only live once. And I was one of those kids who ran home to see it after school. Priced as it is its quite a bargain. Full of new extras to tantalize you. I have seen the series at least twice all the way through. Even with its bloopers I enjoy the series immensely and love watching the run of the show from time to time. A true Dark Shadows fan won't be able to resist this set. I am turning fifty this April and hope I live another 30 or 40 years to enjoy my dvd collection. They say you can't take it with you does that mean there's no more tv on the other side. Better enjoy it now just in case. I have gone to a few ds cons and had a great time and have met a few of the stars. Very nice atmosphere Lara Parker appeared in a brentwood bookstore and I sat a few inches away from her as she recited some exerts of her new book at the time The Salem Branch which she lovenly autographed for me. I will have to find some friend to give my first dvd set once I get these and spread DS to some other family to get hooked on a unique series that can't ever be made like this again.

UPDATE:I can't speak for every one but I pre ordered mine in February and Amazon fulfilled their obligation filling orders first come first serve. I chose free shipping and got mine only five days after opening day April 10th. Mine was 127 out of 2500, the card is hand signed by Jonathan Frid and is not a copy. Not only that Amazon gave me a refund and got it at significantly  lower price. My birthday was the ninth and this set and five other dvds all came this week Thanks Amazon I am a happy camper. MPI has been flooded with orders and had no idea how many shadow fans are out there. If you didn't get this time sign up for the next set which I am sure will get your order filled. Thanks MPI for the good treatment you gave this series!",1328400000,28,2001,3.9504950495049505
5039987,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Wow, what a great price!! Take it from someone who is kicking himself right now. Let me explain. A few years ago, I started bying the Dark Shadows The Beginning DVD's a little at a time. Being that I loved he show when I was a kid. I don't remember to much about any of it except for the vampire and werewolf. So when I had purchased all of the beginning DVD's I wanted to see more, of course. And of course the $60 or so price tag on each volume was of course, a lot. Being there was 26 volumes, that would add up  to a lot. But then when I saw the price per volume had dropped to around $30 I thought it was unbelievable. So not knowing when the price was going to go back up, I bought all 26 volumes to complete my set. Now I have all episodes at what I thought was a great price. Until I saw this complete collection at this price. Now you know why I am kicking myself. I am almost through watching all episodes. I have not had any problems and the picture quality is good. Just wish I knew that something like this was coming out so it wouldn't have taken so much room on my shelf and would have hurt my wallet so much. Makes me kind of sick. If I could do it over I would definately not pass this opportunity up. Sink your teeth into it. The price is so low, I'm thinking about buying this one as well.",1328313600,27,1308,3.9545454545454546
5039988,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Dear Loyal Dark Shadows Fans!

First of all, we here at MPI Home Video would like to thank you for your loyalty to DARK SHADOWS. Bringing it to market has been our pride and joy for over 20 years!

This coffin set has been in the works for years and we are very excited to see it come to fruition alongside the Warner Bros. Johnny Depp/Tim Burton film. We hope you like the set as we spared no expense or effort in making it absolutely perfect.

To answer some of your questions:
The first pressing of the coffin set (THE LIMITED EDITION) releasing on April 10th (including Jonathan Frid's autographed Barnabas postcard and a Limited Edition serial #) are, for the most part, sold out. However, if you have placed a pre-order with a retailer (like Best Buy or Amazon), you SHOULD have a copy reserved for you. Amazon will not take orders unless they have enough product to fill them. If you have not yet ordered the coffin, don't fret! THE DELUXE EDITION (a re-press of the Limited Edition) is being released on July 10th. It is nearly identical to the Limited Edition (the version you see on this product page), although it does NOT include a signed Barnabas postcard and it does NOT have a limited edition serial number.

The Deluxe Edition coffins are not limited in quantity, although they are subject to going on backorder (therefore we still recommend that you order early). In short, EVERYONE can eventually own the complete series of DARK SHADOWS in this special coffin box set!

The Deluxe Edition will likely have its own product page on Amazon in the coming weeks. Please be on the lookout. The UPC code is 030306799193. You can type this number directly into Amazon's search bar and the product page will appear once the page is built.

If you have received your copy of the LIMITED EDITION already, congratulations! But you really shouldn't have, as retailers were not supposed to ship the product before its April 10 release date. MPI is investigating this issue and if you can please notify us where you purchased the set and when it arrived, we would be very grateful (don't worry - we won't use your personal information in any way and you won't be required to return your set either to us or to the retailer you purchased it from - once it's yours it's yours! We simply are asking for assistance in determining which retailers mistakenly shipped their sets early). You can email us at webmaster@mpimedia.com.

ENJOY your new collection!!!

Sincerely,
MPI HOME VIDEO",1327968000,9,2483,4.678899082568807
5039989,3,B006Z7Z3KY,"Besides releasing this to capitalize on the new DS movie starring Johnny Depp, why hasn't MPI remastered this in blu-ray? Many fans have all the individual DVD box sets which have been out for a long time. Since blu-ray is rapidly becoming the industry standard, why not just go ahead and release this in blu-ray? Perhaps said remastering would be expensively prohibitive, but from a fan point of view it would be well worth it even if the quality of the prints just were notched up a bit.",1327622400,9,489,4.568181818181818
5039990,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"I have seen the entire series many times and starting when it was first on TV many years ago.  To say that I love this TV series would be a major understatement.  There is just something about it that makes me want to see it again and again.  Maybe because it mentally transports me back to a time when I was a kid at home after school, a time before my parents were deceased, a time when all seemed right in the world and the scariest thing about life was Barnabas and Angelique in Dark Shadows.",1327622400,244,496,4.145833333333333
5039991,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Dark Shadows is a Gothic TV show of the likes of which has never been seen before and we likely will never see anything quite like it again. Dark Shadows began as a traditional soap opera but soon found a charm in Gothic storylines borrowed from classic works of literature like Jane Eyre, Turn of the Screw and Dracula.

The show is extremely atmospheric with subtle nods to several classic works of Gothic literature from Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think I like the series best in the 700 to 900 or so episodes (there were over 1,200 episodes) because I feel the show really hit it's stride there. The first 210 episodes are forgettable but once Barnabas Collins joins the show things gradually start to improve and fast becomes the most complelling, complex, Gothic creation to ever appear on television.

Dark Shadows is part drama, part Gothic horror and part science fiction, including such plot lines as the vampire, Barnabas Collins, having to time travel to 1897 in order to save a man from becoming a malicious ghost that torments children in 1968. The show is so iconic that it can boast to being the first thing to ever air on the Scifi channel. When the Scifi Channel first started the first thing they ever aired was the introduction of Barnabas Collins (episodes 210 and 211) of Dark Shadows.

I strongly recommend Dark Shadows for anyone who loves a good, spooky Gothic horror-fantasy romance or even urban fantasy. There is a brilliant timelessness to Dark Shadows that I've seen in few other things such as Hammer Horror movies and Tim Burton films. I strongly recommend Dark Shadows.",1327536000,10,1676,4.7923875432525955
5039992,5,B006Z7Z3KY,"Long before vampires were turned into sparkling emo teenagers, they were imbued with a sense of old-world romance and mystery.

And for a lot of people, that came from ""Dark Shadows."" This gothic soap opera had its cheesy moments here and there, but it had that rare quality of being addictive and entertaining even as it had vampires, ghosts and werewolves. Even better: it drips with traditional gothic atmosphere, with a young woman afloat in a dark, gloomy house filled with secrets.

Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke) arrives in Maine to be a governess to the reclusive Collins family, intending to find out about her past (since she seems to have some kind of connection to them... or something). Instead, she finds a big stew of weird -- the mansion of Collinswood apparently has ghosts and magic, as well as a vampire in the mausoleum.

Yes, Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid) is in the mausoleum... and his entrance (and subsequent transformation into the primary character) is the point when the show went from ""okay"" to ""awesome."" From then on, the story unfolds into a long, complicated tangle of lost love, amnesia, time travel, witchcraft, MORE ghosts, reincarnation, golems, body-swapping sorcerers, the ancient Leviathans and a parallel universe -- all centered on the Collins family.

It's really quite hard to summarize the entire series, but suffice to say that ""Dark Shadows"" is a pretty delicious series -- it drips with romanticized gothic atmosphere, with plenty of classic tropes (vampires, ghosts, even a Frankenstein monster). And for a soap opera of any type -- be it supernatural or mundane -- it's actually very well written, with distinct plot arcs and ongoing plot threads.

The slowest part of the story is actually the beginning parts, which were fairly low on supernatural events and focused on Victoria. But once ""Dark Shadows"" embraced the supernatural, it blossoms like a black rose. Does it have cheezy moments? Yes, sometimes -- but unlike the cheeziness of a lot of vampire-themed TV/movies, there's a dignified, almost classical quality to ""Dark Shadows.""

And it has a pretty decent cast over all, with Lara Parker, David Selby and Grayson Hall as a few of the most prominent standouts. But the best one is undeniably Frid as Barnabas Collins -- his character was such an intriguing one that he not only became one of the primary characters, but evolved from a tortured villain into a selfless, heroic anti-hero.

As for the layout of this series, nobody is 100% sure at this time of the content, but if it does have 131 discs it almost certainly has the complete series, both with and without the vampire subplots. But don't expect any special extras, probably.

For people burned out on current vampire stuff, ""Dark Shadows: The Complete Series"" is a refreshingly classic look at vampire/supernatural soapiness. It might take awhile, but it's worth watching.",1327449600,23,2902,5.04384133611691

I enjoyed this growing up, but it hasn't aged well.

It is like watching paint dry, the vampire version.

Moves at a glacial pace and doesn't get to the meatier parts for a while.  I never realized that our local TV station didn't start running it until the nice vampire bits, which aren't the entire series by any means.  These undead probably should remain in their coffins.

Also, I forgot it was in black and white, probably b/c I only had a B&W TV growing up... It's not the 'best quality' black and white.

The three stars is because the BOX it comes in is a thing of love and praise.... if you want a talking piece, this may be for you, otherwise, I'd probably skip it.

If you're looking for vampire epics worth watching, buy Buffy the Vampire Slayer box set, and its companion (spinoff) series 'Angel', about a vampire with a soul. For a sexier version, try True Blood.  If you like stories set on old estates, watch Downton Abbey, both the architecture and the acting is better.",1526083200,,1079,4.544041450777202
