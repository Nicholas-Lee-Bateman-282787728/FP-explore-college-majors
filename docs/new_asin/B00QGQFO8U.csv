8691256,1,B00QGQFO8U,I was really disappointed with this book. I'm a huge fan of charlotte's. The lunch and dinner recipes seemed mostly good but I noticed everything had sweet potato in it and there were a lot of egg recipes. I didn't find the recipes original and the book certainly wasn't worth the $15 I paid. Money wasted. I could've gotten these recipes online for free. Sorry Charlotte.,1462147200,,372,4.651515151515151
