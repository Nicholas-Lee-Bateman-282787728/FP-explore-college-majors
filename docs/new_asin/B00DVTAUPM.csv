8598449,4,B00DVTAUPM,Yes it is low budget but is as good as other movies with much bigger budgets. The movie is fun and funny and some good scifi thrown in to boot.,1502236800,,143,3.8
8598450,4,B00DVTAUPM,"This is a very low budget Sci-Fi short film.  Note the 25 minute run time.  If you are a fan of camp low budget films then you may like Moonie and the Spider Queen.  I felt that Nikoma DeMitro was appealing as the character of Moonie; I know of this actress because she is in the feature length thriller ""Cam-Girl"".",1404432000,,315,4.216666666666667
8598451,4,B00DVTAUPM,"Nicola Cuti brings his adaptation of his cheeky,sexy, Starbabe to the screen in this first serialized chapter. Moonie first appeared in 1968 as a self-published underground comic by Mr Cuti, and has been delighting fans with her voluptuous form ever since. The subject of many comics, and even novels, seeing Cuti bring her to the screen is wonderful indeed. Chaptered in serialized form at approximately 25 minutes each installment, it moves at a brisk pace and keeps your attention through out. Make no mistake, there's plenty of T&A involved here, and dirty jokes abound, so it's definitely not for everyone. But for those of us who love a good dose of the wink-wink-nudge-nudge it has it in spades.

Working with a small budget has created a bit of a blessing for Cuti (who wrote and directed the movie) as the film relies on the clever use of the often-times hilarious (on purpose!) dialog. Oh, there's special FX of course, and Cuti manages to make the best of the limited resources on hand. Of particular interest is the use of miniatures in place of CGI, which in my book is always a plus and the model work is fun for old school FX geeks like myself.
Also of note is the rather outstanding soundtrack supplied by the band THE SLUTTY HEARTS,whom I've made note of to seek out more of their material.

Sexy women, off color humor, and a well written and directed effort from Cuti. Don't let the smaller budget fool you, this is a fun romp and for fans of Cuti's comic books and novels, it's already a treasure.",1376092800,3,1517,4.614814814814815
