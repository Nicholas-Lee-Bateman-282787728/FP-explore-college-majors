8275152,5,B0019SQI6C,"A lot of wonderful, slightly dorky fun. If you like fantasy style low budget films with some pretty funny writing, this might be the one for you. The laughs keep coming and coming. This group of role-playing table toppers is looking for a little more out their game, and maybe you know what that's like. The game is dying down, they need and spark. What happens next takes the characters through some fun twists and turn, all the while delivering some interesting historic references. If you've been a gamer or know one this movie might make your/their day. My teenage daughter, believe it or not, says this is her favorite movie. So check out Welcome to Reality! P.S. The outtakes are hilarious too.",1424476800,,700,4.699186991869919
8275153,5,B0019SQI6C,"I screened Welcome To Reality this evening on my downstairs neighbor's big-screen DVD player. He wants a copy.

I was expecting a Saturday-afternoon-in-the-garage version of Spamalot--and there ARE Monty Python elements in the scenario--but I was astonished at how well-crafted it turned out. If it was low-budget and silly, you were all obviously PROFESSIONALS doing low-budget and silly, nevertheless. And I never--repeat, NEVER--saw the surprise twist coming at
the end. That's right--twenty years reviewing plays and you pulled the rug on me.

Your SFX-wiz Feutz does precision-timed graphics and you've got a sharpshooter foley man as well. The audio is rough, but you probably know that already. The editing was superlative--I followed the transitions between dimensions with ease. And if your ensemble was, indeed, improvising, they showed remarkable attention to one another's cues.

So some of the gags worked better than others, and some I may have missed on only one viewing, but for a home movie, it's got enough of the Right Stuff that I'd like to see what you-all could do with better microphones and higher-quality weapons.

Congrats and props (as the kids say) to your whole company. This is an impressive accomplishment, and you can quote me.",1282176000,,1259,5.28
8275154,2,B0019SQI6C,"I will rate this against others in its weight class. The Gamers, and especially Dorkness Rising are far superior to this. I expected inexpensive production values. The writing was bad, jokes were driven into the ground far too often. It just wasn't as good as other films in its class. The basic idea is good and the twist ending amusing. Between those two points we get the same jokes over and over.",1252972800,3,400,4.569444444444445
8275155,4,B0019SQI6C,"Ran across this one night while browsing Amazon, and on a whim ordered it. There wasn't a whole lot of information in the description and no reviews - so I really didn't know what to expect. Just got through watching it and thought I would post a review for anyone else that might be curious. First off, this is a `movie' - one apparently made by a very independent film company. The disc shipped to me was a DVD-R and not a mass-produced DVD like you would regularly get. The DVD-R worked fine. The `quality' of the movie itself - reminds me a lot of the student projects I saw back when I was teaching high school. I think that the look is a bit of a combination of that is what they were going for and because they are an independent film company. The cast looks to be college age students. The acting is very exaggerated high school theatrics - which is what I think that they were trying to do. The movie at times has some pretty impressive `special effects' - they too are a bit over exaggerated and made to look a bit amateurish.

The movie itself is about a group of `students' who are playing a role-playing game and it switches from them imagining themselves in the game and them in a classroom. At times some of the stuff they come up with is hilarious - especially if you have ever played one of these games yourself. Some of the humor can be a little `crude', but usually to a degree that most young kids watching will probably not understand.

All-in-all, I liked it. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the audio is a bit off in places. I look forward to this group's next production.",1218844800,,1612,4.2993421052631575
