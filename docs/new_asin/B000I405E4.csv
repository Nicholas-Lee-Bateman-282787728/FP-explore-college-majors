2652982,4,B000I405E4,"Re-cycle is a relatively new tour de force by Pang brothers and probably one of their last movies made in Hong Kong. After Re-cycle Oxide Pang shot Diary - a curious little psychological thriller and then both he and his brother Danny moved to Hollywood. Hope they'll succeed there because after all these years of making really nice movies it'll be a shame if they blow their chance there.

To tell the truth Re-cycle is a film like no other I've seen. I wouldn't be able to find a similar one neither in Asian cinema nor in Western cinema. Maybe if you need some resembling I'd recall What Dreams May Come with Robin Williams and The Cell with Jennifer Lopez although the second one stands pretty far. You won't find a single similar film in the Pangs' filmography. Neither their ""Bangkok trilogy"" nor their ""The Eye trilogy"" nor Ab-normal Beauty, nor The Tesseract are close to what they invented here. They invented, some people invested, and finally we got a real piece of art, an outstanding film, a picture which you ought to see even if you're not a big fan of Hong Kong cinema and of Pang brothers in particular. It's like Citizen Kane or The Matrix - you've got to see it to... just to see it. In no way I'm comparing Re-cycle to the above-mentioned two, it's just that this movie is something very rare nowdays, a movie made with sheer devotion, bright imagination and limitless fantasy. It's really like no other. You may not like the story-line or CGI (they're great though) or acting, but anyway if you want to see something fresh - try this one.

It's useless to retell the story, I'd just say a few words that pretty much say it all - a young writer (played by beautiful Angelica Lee from Koma and The Eye) finds herself in her imaginary world. What at first looks like a world of dreams or illusions then turns out a world of all things rejected, refused and negated - from thoughts to people. Certainly Lee's character has some mission to accomplish in this world, and I have to say this place is full of peril and is not so easy to leave.

Two-disc Hong Kong edition has great booklets with some art design where you're shown what you (along with Angelica Lee's character) are going to encounter in the world of Re-cycle (believe me even the sketches impress a lot, not mentioning the movie itself). Here are some places' names, and the rest is up to your imagination untill you see the film: Playground of the Damned, Forest of Hang, Toy Ruin, City of Books, Ghost's Bridge, Embryo Tunnel... I say you may not like Re-cycle after all, but you'll definately appraise its ingenuity. By the way I'll be much surprised if it's not in a remake list of all major Hollywood studios. And just as a remark - Re-cycle became a real hit in Asia and was very warmly received at Cannes film festival.",1173484800,4,2807,4.510805500982318

2652985,4,B000I405E4,"This is very clearly a pro-life film; it smacks you in the face with that message several times.  There's nothing subtle about it.  But according to the Pang Brothers, ""that just happens to be one of the topics in the movie.  We are not out to say if abortion is right or wrong.""  Then why make it the overriding theme of the movie?

The story involves an author with a bad case of writer's block who feels the stress deeply when her dopey agent announces her next book will deal with the supernatural and it's called Re-cycle.  Talk about pressure.  Now she has to actually write the darn book.  It doesn't help that her ex-boyfriend (a married man) shows up after eight years to say he's finally divorced, let's pick up where we left off.  Unfortunately, she can't do that as she did something eight years ago (out of spite) and now he's just a reminder of that one decision.  Cue spooky elements consisting of stray hair (she knows it's not her hair that she keeps finding around her apartment......at that rate she'd soon be bald!), weird sound effects, belligerent phone calls that are nothing but angry noises, the sense that she is not alone.....well, there is that shadowy person loitering about.  Then her garbage moves, there's a paper trail, a light in the night sky, persistent wind, and finally a faulty elevator.  Before you can say BOO, she's in a strange place (a cross between Wonderland and Oz on a bad day).  After that, it's all about the FX and funky imagery.  A lot of it would be exceptional but for the lack of light (most of these strange scenes take place in gloom of day).  It's next to impossible to appreciate artistry when it can't be seen properly.  Someone also went a little crazy with the filters, color coding some of the places she's forced to wander through.

I've watched this movie twice.  Don't care much for the story but the creativity involved is impossible to ignore.  I wanted to love it but I can't.",1426636800,,1945,4.553314121037464

As I watched the film, I felt like I was being dragged and pushed by the filmmakers more than I was being guided and motivated by the events in the story.

2652992,5,B000I405E4,"I don't write a lot of reviews, I respond to even less.  But this movie has me writing a review and responding to a couple of negative reviews.

First, before I talk about the movie in general, let me drop a couple of observations related to the movie though.  One is, this is only barely sci fi.  I grew up reading Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Anderson, Norton you name it.  I know sci-fi.  This should be in the horror category....except it has that rare ability to make you think and takes you into...sci fi in the process.  I am so confused right now...lol
Let me try to put it this way.
If you like good sci fi based on being able to think outside the box, outside what is presented in the movie, this one will give you fodder to think on.  Be prepared to do a lot of thinking and dreaming though.  If you just want the quick fix, this likely isn't the sci fi premise for you.
Or....
if you like horror, be ready to expand on what the movie gives and enjoy several extra chills.  Some s pretty standard, but if you really digest a little past the end, you can enjoy some fine shivers.  Again though, if you want the quick fix, likely not the best choice for you.

Okay, on to what gives me the feeling this is a 5 star movie.

If you can and will read between the lines, follow the plot, think it through, this movie is exactly what you want and need.  2 hours on screen, then as much imagination time as you want and can give it after.  In my not always so humble opinion, the mark of a good book or good movie is that I can walk away at the end, but it hasn't ended in my mind.  I can create other scenarios, other worlds, other outcomes because the feast is so rich I am not done just because the closing credits have rolled.  This movie fulfilled that requirement in spades.

Okay, that's enough.  Let me just say this though.

If you can expand your mind and see beyond the obvious, this is a movie you will be glad you watched.  If sensations that might appear to beat you over the head are all you are capable of seeing, find some simpler fare.  Truthfully, not trying to say I am a paragon of thought and genius, but a one dimensional viewer will be lost, disappointed and confused by this movie.

2653030,4,B000I405E4,"This story starts out with a writer under pressure from her manager and or publisher to write a fourth story involving ghosts. The title has already been chosen and will be called Re-Cycle.
I was amazed by the direction this story took me on. I thought it was just a ghost story, but it winds up being soso much more about life, the choices we make, the consequences of those choices, not being able to take back those choices and finally trying to live with the consequences of those choices.
I am still trying to adjust to other cultures and the mannerisms used by their actors, directors and writers in their story telling. Sometimes their gestures seem comical when in reality they are not and vise versa, so I have to keep a keen eye on the action/story to read into what they are really saying.
This story starts out a little slow with a supernatural presence making itself known to the writer and helping her write the story. The writer is unexpectedly thrust into different dimensions to guide her on a journey she thinks is to help her write her new book at first, but her journey is far from what she could have ever imagined. The story might find you wondering WTH is going on here, but be patient the story does come together quite well and you'll see the light.  I don't want to give the details of her journey and spoil the story for those who haven't watched it yet.
""WARNING"" I will tell you about one stage of her journey that may be hard for some viewers to watch. The writer passes through a tunnel filled with fetuses at different stages of development (some are healthy and others are malformed) Again I only mention this to warn viewers who may be alarmed, offended, upset or traumatized by the images. This is a key component to the story and reveals quite a bit to the writer.
The story evolves in so many different directions, but brings the viewer full circle through the choices that the writer has made and to the realization of the consequences of her choices that she must now live with.
This story will leave the viewer contemplating their own life choices after watching the writer experiencing the heart felt choices that she has made over the years.
This movie does slow down at times and does get a little confusing, but it comes together to give the viewer a clear picture of what this story is all about through (cool special effects, sights and sounds) and will leave you thinking about your own life and the choices you've made! It has something for almost all ages and a deeper meaning for life.",1395705600,,2535,4.510869565217392

2653032,5,B000I405E4,"Some here have said that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. I see it as you deciding how the movie will touch you.

This isn't a guidebook or Dante's Inferno (similarities yes)

It's up to you to see a detail or a wisp of a possibility. It's up to you to see the depth and decide what it means to you.

2653034,4,B000I405E4,"We picked this movie mainly because it had the word 'phantasmagorical' in the description.  Any movie that uses that word is almost guaranteed to be worth watching.  On the whole, it was a good pick.

The story is anything but straightforward, but in a nutshell, an author gets sucked into a world built of her own discarded ideas and has to find a way to escape.  I won't say more for fear of spoilers but this is one EXCEPTIONALLY creepy movie both in concept and in execution.  It sustains this creepiness without a great deal of violence and not really any gore to speak of; it's a deeply psychological terror.

On the positive side of things, this movie is visually stunning to the Nth degree.  I found myself wishing that we'd been able to see this in the theatre instead of on a television.  This would be one to sit near the front in the center of the theatre for.  Even on the small screen this one has a yawning depth of visuals.  Also, as I said above, the story is extremely nerve-wracking but doesn't have to splash blood on you to do it.

To the negative, the story fades a bit towards the end.  The movie veers into what would appear to be a visual polemic against abortion; while the scenes around this topic are exceptionally horrifying and effective, one does get the sense of being lectured to a bit.  Near the very end the special effects seem unnecessarily forced and don't really add to the story in any way.  At times when the movie tries to be an action flick rather than a psychological horror things just don't work out in its favor..

To sum up, an extremely disturbing and well-executed movie about the place where all those discarded objects and ideas in our lives go.  Highly recommended if you want to be terrified out of your mind and want to exercise your eyeballs.  Those seeking a more erudite offering may be a bit disappointed.  Good escapist horror mostly unencumbered by detailed storyline.

What I like about this movie was the overall message; it can get cloudy with the switch between horror, to suddenly fantasy, to inspirational, to incredibly sad... but the message pretty much endured; and that message is, what do we abandon in the name of ease?  Essentially we are willing to abandon a lot, including human life, in order to fulfill our own goals; whether we ignore the sacrifices of those who came before us or even our own children, our society has embraced the notion of everything being 'disposable.'  And the end I had tears in my eyes at how true it was; we care only for ourselves, and even our children pay a horrible price for it.

Granted the movie had its ups and downs, mainly that it couldn't figure out whether it was a horror movie or a fantasy movie, a boundary that doesn't really go well together.  That aside, I loved the message of this movie!",1388880000,,1050,4.4375

1- Are you Asian?
2- Are you a woman?

If you answered no to both, please keep your criticisms to yourself.

Spoiler alerts next!

I am Asian and yes I am a woman. I started watching this movie without even knowing what the hell it was about and had no expectations of any kind. I really thought this would be another creepy horror movie with the pale Asian lady with long hair all over her face making weird noises... that's what a lot of Asian movies are about and it usually scare me enough cause when I was a little girl I kept hearing my dad telling me scary movies about those lol!

So the first half hour it's what you expect of an Asian horror movie, but then... things change and this movie succeeded to make me cry lol! I cried at the scene where they were at the ""hell money valley"" where the dead are sitting at their graves forgotten by their love ones, their offspring. It made me sad, it made me realized that I haven't burn hell money to some relatives that passed away a while ago... And if you're like me, I felt sorrow and a lot of sadness when she was running in the tunnel where the fetuses were... the abandoned ones. How sad is that...

I liked the movie very much because for an underrated foreign horror movie to be able to make me cry and scare me back a minute later few times in a row, that's pretty good!

2653069,2,B000I405E4,"This film is indeed a prime example of Fantasy meets Horror. Ting-Yin is a well-known author of a Romance trilogy, and endeavors to write her first supernatural book. Upon beginning this book called ""Re-cycle"", she is almost immediately confronted with a character idea she had discarded in the trash earlier that evening. As she begins to put the pieces together, she realizes that what she is writing, in turn is coming to life, and is directing her down a particular path. Where does this path take her? To another dimension where discarded items- from amusement park rides, to long forgotten relatives, as well as aborted fetuses- go when they are ""abandoned"".

Here in lies the real truth behind why she is pulled into this world. A little girl she meets here, and lovingly names Ting-Yu, assists her on her travels through this other dimension, in order to get her back to her own world, and is in fact the spirit of the 8 year old daughter she would have had, had she not had an abortion. This is only the first twist (though you definitely see it coming). Upon being delivered back to the safety of her own bed, she discovers a woman in her apartment, typing a story that ends with Ting-Yin herself, returning to the real world. Now there are TWO writers of this story! Although, an old man she meets early on in an amusement park did tell her there were other writers, thus you are left with the possibility of infinite writers to a never ending story.

There are a few more details of course, but this about wraps it up. I give this a solid 2/5 purely for visual content, and the well achieved effort of the genre integration- I've seldom seen it accomplished to this degree. Though not 100% without the flaws of merging, it does leave you both spooked on occasions and amazed by the true beauty of cinematography and imagination brought to life.

I withdraw three stars automatically for the ANTI-ABORTION message in this plot. It is heavy handed and I have no doubt that this film could potentially cause an already grief stricken woman who has endured an abortion, to literally hurt herself. It was like a guilt trip from a priest- not everyone can withstand such a harsh criticism. So please, do not recommend this film to someone you may know personally who has had an abortion. This has the ability to hurt them. I greatly disliked this aspect of the film, and it ruined the fantasy world I was experiencing whilst watching. There is a 'Mommy, why did you abandon me?' scene in the last ten minutes that you have full permission to skip if you please.

In essence,there is great beauty, creativity, ambition and experimentation in this film. It would be worth watching for these reasons alone. In fact, you can watch it until the last ten minutes, and be mostly okay with the terrible plot/message that is crammed down your throat. However, I did like the aspect of forgotten relatives, with no one caring for their graves or bringing flowers. That one did appeal to humanity.

Now that you know for the most part what to expect, suspend that belief, turn out the lights and just roll with it.",1377043200,5,3109,4.625
2653070,4,B000I405E4,"Re-Cycle is a stunning piece, filled with eerie wonder.

For western audience, many elements may seem befuddling or be easily misconstrued, as the film draws heavily from Far-Eastern mythology.

Additionally, Re-Cycle does not limit itself to a simple 3-act structure; instead, the dreamlike narrative follows a wandering path fraught with fearful wonder.  It may be jarring at times, as portions of the plot are explicitly explained by the characters, while many important themes are only expressed through imagery and events.  This is not a simple film, and one must be an actively engaged viewer to enjoy Re-Cycle fully.

In regard to the controversy:
---SPOILER WARNING---
Family responsibility is an important part of Chinese and Eastern-Asian mythology.  Those who do not give tribute to their family line are punished.  Thus, there is a portion of the mythological hell-like underworld devoted to the unborn (including stillborn and aborted fetuses).  As this film explores many realms adapted from the Chinese underworld, including the realm of the unborn, many interpret this film as being Pro-Life.  However, the far stronger theme offered by the film is one of forgiveness and reconciliation, a far more neutral message.

 -->BIG SPOILER<--
Ting-yin is finally given the opportunity to overcome her guilt over having had an abortion. She and her unborn daughter get the opportunity to forgive each other and both are freed to move on.
-->End Big SPOILER<--",1375228800,2,1467,5.334782608695652
2653071,2,B000I405E4,"Too much of the movie dragged-on unnecessarily. It started in one direction but then veered off into someone's bad acid trip.

Visually obtuse, dark and dreary. The dialog is cheap as if from an old Godzilla movie - mostly oohs, aahhs, heavy breathing and longing stares.

It was obvious to me what was what and who was who except for the last 20 seconds that does little but leave a giant elephant in the room.",1374624000,,411,4.466666666666667
2653072,3,B000I405E4,"I'll start off by saying that I came upon Re-Cycle when looking through the Amazon Prime Streaming collection, specifically the horror category. I can't stress enough that this film is most absolutely not a horror movie. It is, at best, a fantasy film with horror elements. If you're looking for a hardcore horror flick, look elsewhere.

Re-Cycle it seems is a very divisive film, and understandably so. The things it does well, it does very well; the things it does poorly, it does extraordinarily poorly. The first 15-20 minutes or so are a drag. Not only does very little of interest actually happen, but the characters on screen are often simply spouting exposition. The dialogue doesn't feel like two people having a conversation as it should, but instead two people trying the best they can to explain the situation to an interloper as quickly as humanly possible. Then the story picks up and turns into a traditional Asian horror film, complete with the creepy ghost figure with long, black hair. These horror scenes are done very, very well, using sounds,long camera shots, and quick teases to build as much tension as possible. After not-too-long, the main character finds herself in the land of everything that has been abandoned and the movie turns into an Odyssian trek through a Grim's Fairy Tale-type land. About halfway through the film, some viewers may find off-putting the lack of subtlety the filmmakers used in addressing a particular social issue. By the climax of the film, this same social issue comes up and is no longer addressed with a ""lack of subtlety"", but with a blatant disregard for it. The end of the film also makes very little sense in trying to get you to understand it, which somewhat comes as a shock given the rest of the film's directness.

For everything wrong with the script, the camera work almost makes up for it. The cinematography is nothing short of gorgeous and the special effects usually look good. It's impossible to describe some of the beautiful scenes in the film and I would almost recommend watching it at least once just to experience it. That being said, for a movie that feels slightly rushed in the last quarter of it, there are a considerable amount of melodramatic/faux-moody long-/slow-mo shots that simply do not need to be there. There are also too many shots (often in slow-mo) of people simply walking somewhere.

She is so believable in all of her roles; one of my favorite actresses. This blu-ray is pretty impressive. Great film. Great story. Great ride. Must-buy blu-ray.",1276732800,2,524,4.965909090909091

2653104,3,B000I405E4,"This film has some significant factors in its favor; strong performances from Angelica Lee and her wonderful young co-star, emotionally charged set pieces, and some truly creepy moments. It's unfortunate and frustrating that it has significant elements which work against it success. The green screen work is excessive and often the actors are inaccurately lit in the foreground, ruining the illusion. Some sequences go on far too long and lose their potential impact. For every original idea and image, there seem to be two incredibly derivative ones. For example, the poor-man's-Romero-zombies used to portray many of the abandoned spirits. And, do we REALLY need yet another film with malevolent, long-haired female spirits lurking about in the background? Do we need more running-water-as-threat sequences? These tired retreads cripple the more original visuals. Another problem, common to many Asian genre scripts, is superfluous explanatory dialogue. The exact nature of the most disturbing sequences in the film is made quite clear with preceding explanations and very clear visuals. Yet, the whole thing gets explained by a character after the fact. (one could argue that this is because the sequence has a direct link to that character's nature) Finally, the music is incredibly generic. keyboard attempts at orchestral strings feel cheap when accompanying the lush visuals. However, I still recommend the film. There are incredibly touching character-driven moments throughout, and some truly effective tension-release sequences.",1266451200,,1539,5.666666666666667
2653105,4,B000I405E4,"I really did not know what to expect when hitting play on Re-Cycle.  I was sitting down on a chilly afternoon with some tea and figured this would be a great movie to relax and cuddle up under a blanket.  What I found in Re-Cycle was one of the most astonishingly beautiful movies I have ever watched.  I truly wish I would have purchased this in Blu-Ray.

The beauty was mildly underplayed by a 'spirit/ghost' which takes focus within the first half of the movie.  The protagonist in the film is an author exploring her boundaries by drifting from romance novels to a darker, more haunting world.  Despite precautions that when writing about the subject she places herself in harms way to be subjected to ghosts and spirits.  She calmly revels in the idea of experiencing this.

This first part of the movie does this and focuses on the mild yet extremely effective ghost story surrounding the author.  The effects were done tastefully and subtly and therefor caught my interest immediately.  I prefer story-driven and character-driven suspense to power horror and Re-Cycle snatched me immediately by doing so.  As the spirits progressively become more prominent, the movie descends down into a vibrant and extravagant world of dismal fantasy.

Here, the visuals take precedence and captivate the viewer in surroundings that are breathtakingly beautiful and vast to regions that are dreadfully compelling and dark.  At no point did I ever want to look away from this film.  As the author progresses through this discarded world of remnants, we begin to learn about her, her guide and the world in which she finds herself.  While the stories are not overly twisted and confusing, there is enough intelligence to the film to satisfy just about all viewers.  I began to feel for the characters as their journey stretched farther and came to a close.

And when I thought the movie was done, leaving me with a positive, elegant and refined sense of beauty and wonderment, the film adds in one final scene that brings parts of the movie together and leaves you to question a bit about it, too.  I am so pleased with the ending as it did not leave the movie in a linear fashion where it is evident what happened, why it happened, and so on.  The ending allowed moderate interpretation which, for me, leaves it open for additional viewings.

This is not a horror movie, it is more fantasy than horror.  While watching the film, I got the feeling of a darker The Chronicles of Narnia mixed with a little bit of Ringu.

Overall, Re-Cycle was a great watch and trip.  The visuals are nothing shy of captivating and beautiful and I would recommend this movie to any potential buyers in Blu-Ray.  I look forward to watching this again with a friend and hearing their interpretation and level of appreciation for the visual worlds.",1260835200,,2818,4.762886597938144
2653106,4,B000I405E4,"Mainstream horror films today seems so derivative that finding a movie that simply tries to break out of the mold is in itself a treat.  'Re-cycle' isn't groundbreaking, but its weaknesses aren't from repeating (or re-cycling, ha!) the same worn-out storylines.  Instead, the directors, Oxide and Danny Pang, smash together elements of several sub-genres of horror to come up with a creepy fun movie with scenes of intense and interesting imagery.

Angelica Lee is Tsui Ting-Yin, a successful writer who's last effort was made into a wildly popular film, and whose agent has alerted the press that her next novel is a supernatural tale called 'Re-Cycle'.  In a rather heavy-on-the-expository press conference, Tsui is asked if she is afraid of the superstition that writing about the supernatural may invoke it.  After a moment's pause, she claims to be intrigued by the idea.

Sure enough, her writing efforts bring on bizarre events, and during this section the directors succeed at creating an extremely creepy mood.  Eventually, Tsui transitions out of reality and into a dream world of 'the abandoned', where she is pursued (and assisted) by the abandoned creations of the real world as she tries to get back home again.  Here the movie by turns seems a mish-mash of zombie flicks, Japanese ghost stories, and Asian fairy tales a la Miyazaki's anime, which is a rush at first, but by the films final act feels crammed and directionless and just too much.

!!!!*** SPOILERS***!!!

Some viewers may find the ending difficult or exploitive, as it deals with the emotional effects of an abortion Tsui had years before.  I think this will depend on each individual's perspective, and those that are uncomfortable with this theme may want to pass on the movie.  Personally, while I tend to agree with the overall message that abortion may have far-reaching consequences, I'm not sure this is the venue for that argument.  Additionally, the scenes are quite emotional, which could be painful for some viewers.

!!!!*** END SPOILER ***!!!

Despite these weaknesses, and a few other worn out horror film conventions, 'Re-Cycle' still delivers several spooky moments and offers up a bizarre dreamscape in the land of 'The Abandoned'.  It'll be interesting to see if the Pang Brothers revisit this type of horror tale again - and prune a few of the elements until it doesn't feel quite so overwhelming.  As it is, the film's positives outweigh the negatives, but I also feel that it could have been much, much more.",1251590400,,2509,4.992788461538462

As she begins writing, the world of RECYCLE starts to come alive, and as she journeys from the real world into this decaying reality where what we abandon goes, she sees many incredible and disturbing sights.

It's ambitious, but it just doesn't work. This film can't seem to decide whether to scare or amaze, and though it does the latter very well in several scenes (the alleyway filled with amusement park rides was breathtaking) it doesn't save it from embarrassments like the cave of abandoned fetuses, or the cheap looking zombie hoards... cringeworthy! And even when the visuals are high quality and evocative, the synthesized score overpowers any quiet eeriness they're trying to convey and makes the action seem cheesy and comic.

2653110,5,B000I405E4,"Wow. To put it briefly, this film is a whole new level, for the Pang brothers and for horror films in general. This movie transcends horror quickly, despite starting off in similar fashion to other memorable ghost flicks like the Ring, Ju-On, etc. But, in true Pang fashion, the directors have taken the opportunity to mislead the audience into expecting the usual fare and then delivering something completely beyond the promise of a few good jumps.
  THe brilliance of the Pangs is seen in the ability to take things we have seen before and invest them with an actual sense of building dread through the use of music and ambient sound. That said, this film, like the Eye, quickly moves beyond any mere horror film limitations. I think its fair to say that this movie is transcendental of genre, delving into realms of fantasy and surealism in poignent, poetic ways, creating a film that is a series of moments of truly sublime beauty (in the old artististic sense of the word)that lay at the heart of a surrealist landscape meant for artists, poets, and anyone who has ever forgotten someone or something precious.
  I will say this too, while the film could easily have gotten heavy handed at times...it does not, nor does the symbolism. The symbolism throughout the film is often very subtle...and effective. There are several moments when you may want to pause just to consider something you've seen or just to stare at the brilliant camerawork, lighting and effects of the film. Truth is, this movie is utterly enthralling and more than the mere eye-candy some have suggested. Although the end may feel a bit awkward, it helps to consider the clues that build up to it. Highly recommended viewing if you're looking for a movie with more style and story than the usual crappy hack and slash torture flick....",1248480000,,1813,4.782747603833866

American filmmakers have lost all grasp on the power of subtlety, choosing to cater to the ignorant, unthinking masses.
""Re-Cycle"" is what ""Silent Hill"" should have been.
The horrific, deteriorating landscapes occupied by zombies do bring to mind the ""Silent Hill"" of the videogames, and then proceed to make one ponder just how bad the movie was.
But, back to ""Re-Cycle."" My only quibble is that part of the ending was overwrought, but otherwise, it was scary, creepy, disturbing, sad and thought-provoking -- all things that a good horror movie should be.
It focuses on a horrific world in which things that society has abandoned exist in a restless state. It starts out seemingly only about the ideas that writers throw away on their mission to write great books, but then we see the material goods and even the lives that modern-day society so easily throws away.
People (both young and old) are thrown away and forgotten, as if to make room for material excess.
This movie has some truly scary moments, ones that even made me, who's not easily scared, vocally react with fright/surprise.
The rest is suitably creepy and disturbing.
The beginning of the movie is deceptive. It goes slowly along, as main character Ying-Tin works on her latest book, but once she enters the horrific universe, the creepy atmospherics take hold, sometimes each creepy ""stage"" she enters more horrific than the previous.

2653117,4,B000I405E4,"Imagine a dimension where all things that have been discarded and abandoned go -- broken toys, unwanted babies, the forgotten elderly, even fictional characters who never made the cut.

After a run of relatively disappointing movies, Danny and Oxide Pang return with a vengeance in ""Re-Cycle,"" a hauntingly vivid journey that sends Angelica Lee into such a world. This is not your typical Asian horror movie with ripoffs of ""The Ring"" -- this is a dark fantasy journey into a ghastly, bittersweet otherworld full of secrets and lost things, like a Lewis Carroll horror story.

Ting-Yin (Lee) is a bestselling author riding high with her ""My Love"" trilogy, which is being adapted into a movie. Her next book, a horror novel named ""Re-Cycle,"" is announced as well.

All seems perfect, save for an ex-boyfriend (Lawrence Chou) who has just divorced his wife and wants back. And when Ting-Yin starts writing ""Re-Cycle,"" she starts glimpsing a strange long-haired woman in her apartment -- and ends up inadvertently wandering into a desolate, ruined city full of zombies, stairs, creaking carnivals and masked children. It's a dimension of the discarded, and it stretches through nightmarish forests, cities, fields and decaying bridges filled with witchlight.

When she's attacked by ghouls, Ting-Yin is rescued by a little girl who offers to help her get back home. After consulting with an old man in a vast library, Ting-Yin is told that she must find the Transit that leads back to her world. But Ting-Yin and the little girl Ting-Yu -- who seems strangely familiar to her -- are being pursued by a strange faceless woman, who is determined to keep Ting-Yin there forever

""Re-Cycle"" is a very different movie from anything the Pang Brothers have done before -- it's fantasy rather than straight horror, and more in the vein of a grimier ""Mirrormask"" or a more horrific ""Pan's Labyrinth."" You could even consider it a sort of nightmarish ""Alice in Wonderland,"" if Notsowonderland were populated by zombies, ghouls, fetuses and the occasional weird little old man.

For the first twenty minutes, ""Re-Cycle"" looks pretty much like a standard Asian horror movie, with a black-haired woman darting around in the shadows and lots of weird occurrences. But when Ting-Yin wanders into this other world, suddenly things become pure dark fantasy, and this rather generic character blossoms as she becomes close to little Ting-Yu.

And the Pangs' direction is pretty brilliant. They flood the skies with strangely coloured light, and give the fields and cities a mummified, dead feeling. There's not a lot of dialogue in this movie, which makes the vivid imagery all the more important -- we travel from a land of crumbling buildings and grotesque forests to sunny fields and floating mountains. It's poisonous, yet somehow still beautiful.

Yet there are also moments of whimsy, such as Ting-Yu riding in to the rescue on a giant toy horse. And while there's some straight-out horror like the faceless woman and the whole fetus cavern scene, the Pangs also imbue some scenes with poignancy. One particularly heartbreaking scene takes place among the elderly who were neglected and forgotten, and who plaintively hold up their hands to Ting-Yin in hopes of receiving a grave flower.

Angelica Lee is the glue that holds this movie together -- rather than doing the standard horror performance of running around looking scared, she gives a subtle, layered performance with moments of dread, surprise, tension, sorrow and love. And Yaqi Zeng gives a magnificent performance as the mysterious Ting-Yu, who has a heavily foreshadowed connection to Ting-Yin. Their final scene together is utterly heartbreaking, yet somehow satisfying.

The ending is a bit of a brain-twister, though. It makes sense in a bizarre way, given what has been written before, but it feels vaguely incomplete and leaves you wondering just what will happen next.

""Re-Cycle"" is a haunting, horrifying ride through a strange world where the abandoned things end up, and shows the Pang Brothers in top form. Not your typical Asian horror flick.",1236124800,3,4103,5.108955223880597

But its basically about a writer and shes working on her next book but cant come up with any ideas. Then all of a sudden shes actually in this world of a all her forgotten ideas. This world is constantly changing, like it goes through cycles and she cant be in a spot when its changing.  So she has to keep going to find a way out.

2653119,4,B000I405E4,"I blame no one but myself for not loving this movie the first time around, as Re-Cycle is the posterchild for viewer-induced disappointment. For me personally, I expected something that mirrored the Silent Hill videogames - and considering how those Californian simpletons mucked up their attempt at a Silent Hill movie, I was drooling at the mouth to see if Re-Cycle succeeded where they had failed.

Obviously, I deluded myself into believing that Re-Cycle was trying to be something it was never meant to be. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed after an initial viewing. Where were all of the incredibly disturbing, blood-soaked images? Where were the detailed puzzles? Where were the violent death scenes? They were nowhere - and I was angry that Re-Cycle turned out to be its own movie with its own themes. Go figure.

Months later I started to think of the movie more and more. I thought to myself, ""Yeah, that movie was mediocre, but that one scene was really cool."" Then I pondered, ""Wow, that other scene was sweet too, and that other one was awesome."" Eventually, I decided to give it another go. That ""other go"" happened last night, and I ended up watching one heck of a movie.

The fantasy elements kick in at around the 40-minute mark, but Re-Cycle doesn't stoop to boring you during the opening segments with superfluous exposition. From minute one it grabs you with some well-executed (albeit conventional) horror elements that become much less conventional during a second viewing when you identify references to the main theme of the film.

Once the fantasy elements hit, Re-Cycle becomes a non-stop fantasy adventure. I cannot remember a horror film in recent memory with such relentless pacing. Much of this is owed to its fragmented transport of the lead protagonists. They may escape one danger by going through a door, but on the other side of that door is a completely different environment that is no less perilous. Some have criticized Re-Cycle for being scattershot and unfocused, but I would respectfully disagree considering how almost every single horror element references back to the overarching theme of the film. It's no masterpiece, but it works quite well - especially when you identify the references upon a second viewing.

I truly feel sorry for Hollywood fanboys. East Asian cinema already mops the floor with Western cinema in terms of scriptwriting, cinematography, hand-to-hand action sequences, sound, youthful acting talent, and sheer originality (just to name a few). Now, they've given us a fantasy film that mops the floor with the excessively bloated, overrated, self-indulgent twaddle known as Lord of the Rings.

Take the ending to Re-Cycle as an example. The finale within the Transit realm is quite simply the most intense, incredible fantasy sequence I've ever seen. I must admit that I've rewatched that scene about 30 times over the past few days. I'm totally, unequivocally ADDICTED to it. It's so much better than any scene in LOTR.

Better yet, I didn't have to slug through a bunch of generic characters speaking painfully generic dialogue while walking very, very slowly within vast landscapes for 600 friggin minutes like LOTR. Nor did I have to sit through half a dozen superfluous, drawn-out endings stacked one on top of the other. That might be the formula for winning Oscars and attracting moviegoers who like their fantasy films as vanilla as humanly possible, but I personally like my fantasy films with some - oh, I don't know - emotion. In a nutshell, Re-Cycle elicited some excitement (especially near the end), whereas LOTR stagnated in a realm of perpetual boredom.

On a side note, I can't really understand why Oxide Pang is so relentlessly criticized (to the point of unreasonableness) by so many people. It's exceedingly ironic that the people who complain about his scripts are the very same people who shout ""masterpiece"" when referring to those Japanese horror flicks from the 1960s (which will remain nameless) that have some of the worst scriptwriting in the history of horror cinema. In addition, Oxide's use of camera and sound is exceptional, and probably second only to Ryuhei Kitamura or Christopher Doyle.

Nothing this guy does is ever good enough for anyone, even though his movies are better than 90% of everyone else's. Diary, The Detective, Abnormal Beauty, Re-Cycle, The Eye, and Revenge (from the Bangkok Haunted anthology) combine to form the most impressive recent horror/thriller portfolio outside of Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Compare Oxide Pang to any American horror director and guy becomes an instant legend.",1233273600,3,4611,5.080581241743725
2653120,4,B000I405E4,"THE PROS....
This film starts out with some of the best chill/thrill/ photography that I have seen in a long time. It also works off the stark beauty of the lead actress whose subtle emotional displays are frequently seen in close up. Blu-ray is usually showcased with nature scenes, but its ability to capture the human face is what most interests me. The special effects here are also beautiful and run seamlessly along side of a variety of camera and editing techniques. It is a feast of the small stuff done well, like chopping a few seconds of film out of an action sequence to create a feeling of dimensional shift and unreality. Each scene is artistically framed for maximum effect. Especially in the begining of the film, the edits literally keeping you jumping. Elements of traditional Asian masks are blended with simple make up techniques to keep the film from becoming bogged down with too much flashy CGI. Often I find that CGI films have one or two scenes that everyone talks about and once you've seen them the funs over. This film uses a variety of subtle color shifts, camera movements and sets to approach each scene with a fresh cinematic voice. Speaking of voice, you really don't have to worry about the film being in Cantonese. Once the films gets going there is minimal dialog.

THE CONS....
I was so visually engaged by the film that I did not began to worry about the plot until the last 15 or 20 minutes. Even after the social issue theme intruded on what had been a very good visual ride, the film managed to shift gears again at the very end and give me something to mull over as the credits rolled. But that last 15 could have been so much better. If I could edit this film I would take out a jarring, sugary sweet montage sequence near the end. I felt like it removed me too far from the film's psychological edginess. Exiting the lead character from her strange world while her pain over a loss was at its zenith would have made the film and last few minutes work much better. Horror films that seek to send moral or emotional messages frequently make this kind of mistake since the message is invariably part of the plot resolution. I agree with another reviewer that the script deserves a three, but the photography and CGI are 5 star. I can't wait to share this one with friends.",1228780800,35,2313,4.520286396181384

2653122,5,B000I405E4,"As I sat back and prepared myself for my first viewing of `Re-Cycle', the '06 supernatural / horror offering courtesy of the Pang brothers my expectations where set on experiencing stellar special effects, a somewhat challenging storyline and a few thrills and chills now and then. All that along with the presence of the beautiful Angelica Lee in the starring role was sure to provide some worthwhile cinematic entertainment. What I didn't expect was a modern, Buddhist version of Dante Alighieri's `Inferno' along with a biting social commentary concerning abortion and veneration of one's ancestors.

Synopsis: Young and successful novelist Ting-Yin (Angelica Lee) decides to expand her literary horizons by applying her trade to the horror genre. A happenstance comment made by a friend upon learning of her decision is all but ignored but not surprisingly serves as a foreshadowing of what is to come. The comment you ask? It's ""they say writing about spirits brings them to life"". A prophetic utterance if ever I heard one.

Soon eerie, inexplicable things begin to happen while she's alone at home (isn't that always the case). At first she attempts to ignore these happenings, probably attributing them to an overactive imagination but when crumbled, discarded pages of her new book begin to float out of the trash can and flatten out she begins to lose it. In an attempt to maintain her sanity Ting-Yin leaves her apartment, descends in the elevator and walks out the front door. Unfortunately the anticipated relief she hoped to find in the outside world turns out to be something totally other and unrecognizable.

Ting-Yin has entered into a world reserved for abandoned things, which just happens to also include all the characters and storyline contained on the crumpled pages of her novel discarded and thrown in the trash. Like Dante in his classic journey through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, frightened Ting-Yin is in way over her head until she meets an enchanting little eight year old girl in a red coat who in Virgil-like fashion serves as her tour guide through this haunted landscape that appears to be a strange combination of graveyard and dump.

Not wanting to delve too deeply into the storyline and spoil it for anyone I'll just say that an unexpected relationship begins to form between the two as they journey through the dangerous terrain towards ""the Transit"", the only exist from this phantom world back into Ting-Yin's universe. There are numerous lessons to be learned along the way, the most important coming from the little girl with no name who Ting-Yin eventually names Ting-Yu.

2653125,4,B000I405E4,"After the outstanding creepfest that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Eye/dp/B0000AVHAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Eye</a>, I wondered what happened to the Pang brothers.  Mired in pointless sequels and quick cash-ins, I figured. Well, this offering brought the freshness back for me.  ""Recycle"" plays like an Asian horror version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" as imagined by Stephen King and envisioned by Guillermo del Toro.  It's a meta-fictional fantasy nightmare about guilt and coming to terms with your past that is explored through the experience of a struggling writer searching for a good horror story.  At one point the author (played by the ever-more-gorgeous Angelica Lee) tells a reporter that she would like to experience terror that wells up from the heart.  Careful what you wish for, eh?

The first act of this film leads you to believe you are in for another uber-creepy haunting tale with lots of long black hair -this cliche is even referenced which is actually quite funny- and slow build-ups punctuated by horrific scares.  And it works, too.  but then it all changes. Turns out that ghosts and presumably many other supernatural happenings are caused by the bleeding of an alternate world into ours or vice-versa. All of the sudden we're transported along with our heroine to what is described as a dimension for the abandoned, where the forgotten and discarded things of our world find their resting place, waiting to be ""recycled"" into what is implied to be a new life.  Very Buddhist, but dark as hell.  The visuals here are absolutely wonderful. From a massive land of lost toys (apparently they grow real big when they are abandoned) to any number of the dimension's horrifying zombie-like denizens to a truly disturbing cavern filled with fetuses this dimension is amazing to look at adn creepy as can be.  My favorites are a group of hanged men with unsettlingly stretched-out necks and aggressive demeanor.  Along the way she encounters a nameless little girl who becomes her guide through the Lovecraftian Chinese dystopia.  I have to admit I saw the twist coming a mile away, but I still found it to ring true as an astoundingly bold (as in: would not fly in America), emotionally affecting, and philosophically deep choice of endings.  Bravo.

I'm pretty irked that ""Recycle"" hasn't gotten more attention.  If I hadn't read Woopak's typically deep and insightful review than I never would have heard of this.  That is, until the inevitable lame American remake (offer up any bet you like if you don't think it will happen, I will take it) complete with lame upbeat ending.  I'm already ticked off about it and it hasn't even happened yet.  The story takes some pages out of Stephen King's library (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Langoliers/dp/6305899398/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Langoliers</a>&nbsp;comes to mind) and some of the metafictional aspects of the latter&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Tower/dp/B0016HIOX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Tower</a>&nbsp;books, adds a Guillermo del Toro feel along with a spattering of Asian horror conventions, but remains very much it's own entity.  Definitely a unique and rewarding experience overall, but it doesn't quite reach the highest echelon of Asian cinema it was reaching for though I can't really expain why.  Maybe it was the silly ""hell money"" bit that turned me off.  If you're looking for a visually interesting and philosophically fresh take on Asian horror, than be sure to check this one out.  It will not disappoint.

After a run of relatively disappointing movies, Danny and Oxide Pang return with a vengeance in ""Re-Cycle,"" a hauntingly vivid journey that sends Angelica Lee into such a world. This is not your typical Asian horror movie with ripoffs of ""The Ring"" -- this is a dark fantasy journey into a ghastly, bittersweet otherworld full of secrets and lost things, like a Lewis Carroll horror story.

Ting-Yin (Lee) is a bestselling author riding high with her ""My Love"" trilogy, which is being adapted into a movie. Her next book, a horror novel named ""Re-Cycle,"" is announced as well.

All seems perfect, save for an ex-boyfriend (Lawrence Chou) who has just divorced his wife and wants back. And when Ting-Yin starts writing ""Re-Cycle,"" she starts glimpsing a strange long-haired woman in her apartment -- and ends up inadvertently wandering into a desolate, ruined city full of zombies, stairs, creaking carnivals and masked children. It's a dimension of the discarded, and it stretches through nightmarish forests, cities, fields and decaying bridges filled with witchlight.

When she's attacked by ghouls, Ting-Yin is rescued by a little girl who offers to help her get back home. After consulting with an old man in a vast library, Ting-Yin is told that she must find the Transit that leads back to her world. But Ting-Yin and the little girl Ting-Yu -- who seems strangely familiar to her -- are being pursued by a strange faceless woman, who is determined to keep Ting-Yin there forever

""Re-Cycle"" is a very different movie from anything the Pang Brothers have done before -- it's fantasy rather than straight horror, and more in the vein of a grimier ""Mirrormask"" or a more horrific ""Pan's Labyrinth."" You could even consider it a sort of nightmarish ""Alice in Wonderland,"" if Notsowonderland were populated by zombies, ghouls, fetuses and the occasional weird little old man.

For the first twenty minutes, ""Re-Cycle"" looks pretty much like a standard Asian horror movie, with a black-haired woman darting around in the shadows and lots of weird occurrences. But when Ting-Yin wanders into this other world, suddenly things become pure dark fantasy, and this rather generic character blossoms as she becomes close to little Ting-Yu.

And the Pangs' direction is pretty brilliant. They flood the skies with strangely coloured light, and give the fields and cities a mummified, dead feeling. There's not a lot of dialogue in this movie, which makes the vivid imagery all the more important -- we travel from a land of crumbling buildings and grotesque forests to sunny fields and floating mountains. It's poisonous, yet somehow still beautiful.

Yet there are also moments of whimsy, such as Ting-Yu riding in to the rescue on a giant toy horse. And while there's some straight-out horror like the faceless woman and the whole fetus cavern scene, the Pangs also imbue some scenes with poignancy. One particularly heartbreaking scene takes place among the elderly who were neglected and forgotten, and who plaintively hold up their hands to Ting-Yin in hopes of receiving a grave flower.

Angelica Lee is the glue that holds this movie together -- rather than doing the standard horror performance of running around looking scared, she gives a subtle, layered performance with moments of dread, surprise, tension, sorrow and love. And Yaqi Zeng gives a magnificent performance as the mysterious Ting-Yu, who has a heavily foreshadowed connection to Ting-Yin. Their final scene together is utterly heartbreaking, yet somehow satisfying.

The ending is a bit of a brain-twister, though. It makes sense in a bizarre way, given what has been written before, but it feels vaguely incomplete and leaves you wondering just what will happen next.

2653129,4,B000I405E4,"One of the reasons the Pang Brothers' films are so engaging is they have an excellent grasp of sound design and good taste in music. Both this film and Diary (an Oxide solo effort) reached operatic proportions at times. They are not content to hire up a few jingles and play them over and over throughout the film in some sort of branding effort. Each scene has its own soundtrack. Often times the soundtrack seems to lead the scene. I hesitate to call it music video-like because that smacks of demotion, but it is like a music video in the sense that the music is as important as the video.

Re-cycle reminded me of Terry Gilliam's work, but not as desolate or oppressive. It's a beautiful film made edgy by the Pang Brothers tendency to genre hop, mixing in horror as well as melodrama. I think most would agree the Pangs are quite skilled and creative in the visual department but seem to lack a command of the story telling part. I say, ""so what"". I'm happy to be fully engaged while the film is playing and my only after thoughts be fond memories. I don't always need to have a deep philosophical discussion of what a film was trying to say.

There may be better ruminations on the basic idea of this film, and it's a good one--exploring a place where all that's forgotten or abandoned congregates--(Spider Forest comes to mind), but few will be as engaging as this multimedia masterpiece. I had no idea this film was going to take off into fantasy land. And stay there for the duration of the film. It came as quite the surprise, and kept surprising me.

I loved Angelica Lee's man-shoes, and ... is there anything more adorable on this planet than an eight year old Chinese girl? Big round of applause for Yaqi Zeng!",1218758400,,1724,4.484076433121019
2653130,4,B000I405E4,"After the rather disappointing ""The Eye 10"" (aka. The Eye 3) and the abysmal ""The Messengers"", brothers Oxide and Danny Pang returns with ""RE-CYCLE"" (2006). The Pang bros. are identical twins who have a similar style of directing but it is also somehow different. The two brothers seemed to have redeemed themselves with great visuals, decent scares and a fresh concept; and with Angelica Lee in the lead role, with a performance that is every bit as great as what she has done in ""The Eye"", they seal the deal with a Fantasy film with supernatural elements.

Synopsis partially derived from the region-3 dvd back cover:
Chu Xun Ting-Yin (Angelica Lee) is a young writer whose first novel has become a major bestseller in Asia. ""RE-CYCLE"" is her next book, the first one she's written about the supernatural. Every reader eagerly awaits the publication of her new book since they mostly believe that her writings can bring impact to their lives. Ever since Chu Xun began writing her new book, a lot of unexplained things begin to happen. Later on, the young writer discovers that the heroine of her new book has found her way from the ""fictional world"" into the real world. One night, Chu gets caught into the ""other"" existence, a world of mind-bending and intense horror...

What makes Re-Cycle quite special is the fact that the film is a welcome return to the Pang's inimitable style; the heart-pounding soundtrack, the plot build up and the slow reveals; all have made the two brothers pioneers in the books of Hong Kong horror. Their cinematic tricks or technique may seem like a rethread of ""The Eye"" in its first act but they do pull something new out of their sleeves. The Pangs haven't lost their touch, they still have the skill to create tension in the screenplay. The film does have the same old tricks in its first act but the 2nd act does inspire more suspense and emotion. With Angelica Lee in the lead with a very superb performance, ""Re-Cycle"" succeeds where ""The Eye 2"" had failed.

The question is just how and why did Ting-Yin get into this situation in the first place? Just what is this desolate world that she has become entrapped in? The film has a good structure as the plot slowly unfolds. The end result may be a bit predictable to experienced movie watchers but with the film's foreshadowing, the script is quite successful with its goals. The thoughtful screenwriting is successful in generating the thrill and suspense that one may expect from the Pang Bros.; there are quite a number of freaky images specifically when corpses plummet from the sky. The film starts off with lovely Angelica Lee experiencing weird events that ends up with her foray into the supernatural world. Then the film more or less becomes a chase film with lovely Angelica Lee being pursued by ghouls while accompanied by an eight year old girl. The direction goes from the slow-reveal to a heart pounding chase sequence and the actress does a great job in conveying the needed emotions. The cheap scares are used very sparingly and for that, the direction needs to be commended. She befriends an old man who gives her specific instructions on how to get to ""The Transit"", a supposed spot where one can leave this mysterious world. While this element may seem too convenient, it sure doesn't hamper the film that much.

I've mentioned that the first half is more or less made up of the same gimmicks that made the Pangs famous; slow-moving objects, long haired ghosts but once Ting-Yin enters the desolate world, the film takes on a different pace. What also helps it along is the awesome set designs that looks gorgeous and at the same time downright creepy. The film does have a significant amount of special effects and most of them are nicely done. The only complaint I may have is that their quality may shift from time to time; that some scenes seemed to have a larger budget than some others. Still, the imagery is rendered with exquisite detail for the most part, this desolate world can be gorgeous, impressive and at the same time creepy and horrible. Highlights include a forest with ghouls, a place with giant toys, an old circus, rickety buildings. The film's atmosphere give the film an eerie feel although some of the ghouls look a little too ""textbook"" that keeps them from being convincingly scary.

Angelica Lee once again shines in this film and her performance may even surpass that one she did in ""The Eye"" or ""Koma"". The actress can indeed act and it is very important for a film like this to have a very strong lead actress. Lee expresses all the vital points of emotion when one is caught up with the unknown. The film depends on her reactionary skills and Lee doesn't disappoint with her very convincing performance. Ting Yin's (Angelica Lee) links to this desolate world may open a lot of questions and the film does answer them in its own fashion. These links may be a little predictable and truth be told, it isn't unique at all. But the emotions are felt, and it goes without saying that Lee is responsible. ""Re-Cycle"" is a huge success because of Angelica Lee.

""Re-Cycle's"" climax may have a finality that could leave some folks scratching their heads, but if you have been paying attention to its entirety, it does make perfect sense. The film does give all the details throughout, and the Pangs did give the rules that apply to this alternate world. The plot `twist' in the final act may prove to be a little confusing but it does come together once you apply the Pang's logic. The climax will inspire pseudo-intellectuals to take notice, something that the Pang's previous installments never could.

After, the abysmal ""The Messengers"" and the disappointing ""The Eye 10"", audiences wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that Pang have lost their touch. No, the two brothers are very much alive and ""Re-Cycle"" proves that they can still involve and excite with a horror-fantasy film--hey, with Angelica Lee in the lead, you can`t expect anything less.

The story is definitely something you have not seen put on screen before; I can guarantee that.",1206230400,,518,4.505376344086022
2653132,4,B000I405E4,"I blame no one but myself for not loving this movie the first time around, as Re-Cycle is the posterchild for viewer-induced disappointment. For me personally, I expected something that mirrored the Silent Hill videogames - and considering how those Californian simpletons mucked up their attempt at a Silent Hill movie, I was drooling at the mouth to see if Re-Cycle succeeded where they had failed.

Obviously, I deluded myself into believing that Re-Cycle was trying to be something it was never meant to be. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed after an initial viewing. Where were all of the incredibly disturbing, blood-soaked images? Where were the detailed puzzles? Where were the violent death scenes? They were nowhere - and I was angry that Re-Cycle turned out to be its own movie with its own themes. Go figure.

Months later I started to think of the movie more and more. I thought to myself, ""Yeah, that movie was mediocre, but that one scene was really cool."" Then I pondered, ""Wow, that other scene was sweet too, and that other one was awesome."" Eventually, I decided to give it another go. That ""other go"" happened last night, and I ended up watching one heck of a movie.

The fantasy elements kick in at around the 40-minute mark, but Re-Cycle doesn't stoop to boring you during the opening segments with superfluous exposition. From minute one it grabs you with some well-executed (albeit conventional) horror elements that become much less conventional during a second viewing when you identify references to the main theme of the film.

Once the fantasy elements hit, Re-Cycle becomes a non-stop fantasy adventure. I cannot remember a horror film in recent memory with such relentless pacing. Much of this is owed to its fragmented transport of the lead protagonists. They may escape one danger by going through a door, but on the other side of that door is a completely different environment that is no less perilous. Some have criticized Re-Cycle for being scattershot and unfocused, but I would respectfully disagree considering how almost every single horror element references back to the overarching theme of the film. It's no masterpiece, but it works quite well - especially when you identify the references upon a second viewing.

Now, there are flaws here that exist regardless of viewer expectation. There are some moments that get a bit too sappy and melodramatic for their own good (especially near the end), but if you can watch this movie for what it truly is - a fantasy/horror adventure guided by a single, simplistic concept - then you should enjoy it.

On a side note, I can't really understand why Oxide Pang is so relentlessly criticized (to the point of unreasonableness) by so many people. It's exceedingly ironic that the people who complain about his scripts are the very same people who shout ""masterpiece"" when referring to those Japanese horror flicks from the 1960s (which will remain nameless) that have some of the worst scriptwriting in the history of horror cinema. In addition, Oxide's use of camera and sound is exceptional and probably second only to Ryuhei Kitamura.

Nothing this guy does is ever good enough for anyone, even though his movies are better than 90% of everyone else's. Diary, The Detective, Abnormal Beauty, and Revenge (from the Bangkok Haunted anthology) combine to form the most impressive recent horror/thriller portfolio outside of Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Compare Oxide Pang to any American horror director and guy becomes an instant legend.",1203033600,3,3523,5.022260273972603
2653133,4,B000I405E4,"It's close to Halloween, so I figured I should review at least 2 horror films this month. I saw ""RE-CYCLE"" late 2006 but neglected to share my thoughts on it partly because, well, I thought Amazon didn't have this film available and put this on the back burner. Haven't really seen a decent, ""newer"" Asian horror film this month, so may as well go back to one of the year-old ones that I enjoyed at least.

Synopsis partially derived from the back cover:
Chu Xun (Angelica Lee) is a young writer whose first novel has become a major bestseller in Asia. ""RE-CYCLE"" is her next book, the first one she's written about the supernatural. Every reader eagerly awaits the publication of her new book since they mostly believe that her writings can bring impact to their lives.

Later on, the young writer discovers that the heroine of her new book has found her way from the ""fictional world"" into the real world. One night, Chu gets caught into the ""other"" existence, a world of mind-bending and intense horror...

""RE-CYCLE"" is the handiwork of the Pang brothers (The Eye 1 & 2, Forest of Death), they're identical twins, with each a different but similar style of directing. After the dismal ""The Eye 10"" and the mediocre ""The Messengers"", one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that they have lost their touch. Nope, the Pangs are very much alive and ""Re-cycle"" helps them redeem themselves while Angelica Lee gives as a strong a performance as in ""The Eye"".

The brothers still have the skill to create tension in the screenplay. In the past, they've been considered to be ""pioneers"" of something fresh and new in the horror genre, ""Re-cycle"" do offer the same ""cool"" tricks from their other successful films. The film does have a pulse-pounding, effective soundtrack, slow reveals and the intensified build-up reminiscent of ""The Eye"". To the brothers' credit, they manage to pull off something new in this film, the film is more of a mind-bender in the 3rd act and the superb performance by Angelica Lee seals the deal.

In the mysterious desolate fantasy world of ""Re-cycle"", the same shadowy creatures and the ""charcoaled"" undead pursues Chu, while she is desperately trying to get out. The mystery is how did she get into this predicament in the first place? With the film's foreshadowing, the screenplay is a fun watch for attentive moviegoers. The details given and from the script to visuals to the whole sequences, all these play a purpose. The thoughtful storytelling, while indeed solid, also makes it somewhat predictable. Thankfully, the predictability doesn't ruin the film's pacing, the film did succeed immersing me in its runtime. The film changes its tone/pace at times, from slow-buildups to intense, creepy chase sequences while the usual shocking cheap scares are used sparingly.

One thing that helps the film is the stunning visuals and set designs. The desolate fantasy world is given exquisite detail, the imagery is beautiful at the same time creepy and scary. But hey, the film isn't perfect, some designs ARE a bit over the top. The ghouls still have that ""fake"" crazy  look, but thankfully, the eerie atmosphere compensates and it can still prove engrossing.

Angelica Lee once again gives a great performance as usual. The film's key to its success lies with Lee as with ""Koma"" and ""The Eye"". While the film doesn't always ""click"", Lee succeeds in expressing the needed emotions and kept me interested for the most part. The emotional aspect does resonate effectively partly because of the film's themes. Lee is mostly doing a ""reaction"" role but she brings much needed depth and dynamic charisma to give her character a tangible feel.

I have the standard edition 1-disc region-3 release from Universe Laser.
VIDEO/AUDIO: Anamorphic Widescreen 1.78 ratio. EXCEPTIONAL picture quality, you can really tell that it shot in 1080p cameras. Strong black levels coincide with radiant and natural colors. The transfer is very clean and sharp.  The 5.1 Dolby/6.1 DTS track are as exceptional as the picture quality. The sound is crisp and very clear. The DTS Cantonese track is the way to go if you're equipped. The English subtitles are excellent and very visible.

In closing:
RE-CYCLE may have a climax that may leave a lot of viewers scratching their heads, but if you were attentive the whole 109 minutes when the Pangs set their ground rules and logic, it does make sense. This film shows that the Pangs still have the savvy to involve and excite their audience when they're in control. It is better than their Hollywood outing; ""The Messengers"".
