212377,1,6300151875,VERY disappointed!!!  write-up for this DVD did not highlight that that their product could NOT be viewed in USA -- only in Region 2!!!  (whatever that means to a novice)  I'm very angry and disappointed -- I waited and waited for days for the mail and my DVD only to learn when it arrived that I couldn't view it!!!,1372809600,,316,4.322033898305085

212379,5,6300151875,"This film flies under the radar. I first saw this while in high school, and again just recently. I could reiterate many of the other comments but ithe things that moved me then.and now are the great soundtrack ( which I still hear in my head when im.running) the fact that life isn't fair and the world will try to cheat you, but with determination, you can persevere. I love the image of him throwing his stopwatch against the walls that hold him in. He didn't need to prove anything to the world outside the prison, everyone that mattered knew who.was the faster runner. I don't know what ever happened to Peter Strauss, but this was one of his better gritty roles and stands in contrast to all his ""polished"" characters. GREAT TV movie, it has everything you could want, too bad they don't make this kind of film anymore. Well worth a look.",1363219200,,843,4.48051948051948

212381,4,6300151875,"This is a good prison-running movie. I bought it because I'm a runner and I try to watch all running movies. I do like it. It's the story of a man who's sent to prison for murder and in prison he picks up running and become good at it eventually becoming a good miler running laps on dirt tracks around garbage cans in the prison yard. I don't want to spoil the rest, but it's a pretty good movie and I especially recommend it for those who are runners. I think you'll enjoy it.",1354579200,,478,4.095744680851064

I sure wish I was aware of this before I purchased this. I most likely will NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN.

212385,5,6300151875,"I cannot review this particular dvd, but can merely comment on the absence of a Region 1 format! I repeat...what goes on here? When I see the flood of drek out there, that has been in the market for so long, it is difficult to comprehend that this outstanding tv-film has not made the jump, if you will, to dvd for the broader masses here in Canada and the U.S.! Never mind that, this is one of those memorable gems that should get the Blu-Ray treatment! People who have seen this film will agree with me 100% on this. It is a travesty. This flick puts the many big budget films that are foisted upon us today; to shame!! The score, the acting the story! Peter Strauss..head to head with Brian Dennehy, what more can you ask. Intelligent,gripping,gritty and wholly satisfying! Shot on location in Fulsom Prison adds to the authenticity of this film! An uplifting, and courageous look, not only as a film about running, but about life and how it is dealt with behind prison walls. The dialogue is exceptional, with prison 'jargon', or prison 'speak', giving special flavor to the subject matter on hand! Bring us the dvd for region 1, soon, at the very least!! We are all waiting, and what a thrill it would be to be able to have friends and family see something that will stay in their minds for a very long time.",1309046400,2,1313,4.452282157676349

212398,5,6300151875,"I saw the Jericho Mile when it was broadcast in 1979, my senior year of high school, and I have watched it countless times over the years. I have an old grainy VHS recording that I bring out every once in a while when I want to be inspired about running, but I always end up being inspired about relationships, freedom and life in general. To me, one of the most moving parts was when Strauss' character initiates a fight to the death vs the black gang when he clearly has no chance of survival. After being beat to a pulp, his explanation of why he was fighting was a moment that was so shocking and sad that the vicious gang let him live. His reason, though sad, at the same time offered hope. Hope for enduring friendship, hope for race-relations, hope for the human spirit.

As the film's title implies, the inner spirit of this man, which drives him to run, has also shattered mighty barriers.

The theme music is awesome, and it still rings in my head at age 49 when I step outside to run a (not so) quick-paced mile or two...",1268265600,6,1032,4.287179487179487

212403,5,6300151875,"When watching the 1979 made-for-television movie ""The Jerico Mile,"" most viewers will be impressed by how well the film has aged. Relevant, stylish and intense, ""The Jerico Mile"" is arguably one of the great television movies in history. Directed by Michael Mann, who would go on the create ""Miami Vice"" and such A-list Hollywood films as ""Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Heat,"" and ""The Insider,"" this humane film details life in Folsom Prison and the men who scratch out an existence within its cement walls.
""The Jerico Mile"" begins with an extraordinary opening montage, expertly edited with the funky riffs of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" playing in the background. Within their prison, criminals play handball, deal drugs, lift weights and lounge in frustrated boredom. Standing out is Rain Murphy (Peter Strauss), a loner who endlessly runs around trash cans, sweat poring from his body, muscles tense and glistening, escaping the confines in his own, unique way. Serving a life sentence after murdering his father, Murphy obsessively runs on a daily basis. When he's clocked by the prison warden and psychologist one afternoon, they realize Murphy is achieving Olympic-level times.
Murphy has one friend, a black man and cellmate neighbor (Richard Lawson, in a very good supporting peformance) who runs afoul of the white supremacists led by Dr. D (Brian Dennehy, in one of his earliest roles). A murder takes place, leading to a race riot, and Murphy reluctantly finds himself in the middle of inmate tensions. The prisoners eventually bond, building a race track within the prison, thus giving Murphy a chance to make the Olympic team and run for freedom.
""The Jerico Mile"" is a brilliant, symbolic story. Filmed on location, using actual prisoners, Mann went to obvious lengths to achieve utter realism. Strauss won the Emmy for his heartbreaking performance, and deservedly so. When he's not running, his character is a walking time bomb, seething with rage, struggling with a tortured past. His minutes-long monologue when he finally opens up to the prison psychologist is brilliant, hall-of-fame stuff. Strauss' character is never very likeable, constantly on the verge of self destruction, pushing away efforts of the warden and track coach as they attempt to give him a chance for glory. Rain Murphy is running from demons, and they could catch him at any moment.
I would love to see ""The Jerico Mile"" remade today as a major motion picture, though I cannot imagine an actor giving as good a performance as Strauss. Everything clicks perfectly in ""The Jerico Mile."" It is a poetic, inspirational achievement, marked by excellent visuals, terrific supporting performances, the fluid direction of Mann, and the stunning performance of Strauss. This is a true television classic, deserving of rediscovery and a quality DVD release.",1076198400,43,2832,5.185589519650655
212404,5,6300151875,"Hi, my name is Daniel. My father, Danny De Avila, was featured in this incredible peace of reality and historical memborance. I never got the chance to meet my father before but after watching this video I feel as though I have! My father was involved in keeping ""The Jericho Mile"" alive very much so. After the movie was filmed my father along with some of his friends made a proposal to the wardens in regard to keeping the track in the prison yard. The wardens, shortly after, made their final decision to keep the track remaining in the facility. I feel that this is very important to my family knowing that my father helped change part of prison history at Folsom State Penitentiary.",1019952000,21,688,4.556451612903226
212405,4,6300151875,"The dream of ""The Jericho Mile"" began long before it's television debut.  For those of ""us"" who had/have family or friends who were non-paid ""participants"" to this emotionally inspiring movie of basic human triumph.  With time so abundant in prison the need for a watch is not necessary.  But with a stop-watch, freedom is just a few minutes away.  The use of real prison inmates in one of California's toughest penitentiaries brings to life the spririt of ""brotherhood"" and the harsh reality of everyday prison life in Folsom.  With the new Olympic sanctioned race track, Rain Murphy runs not only for Olympic gold but for the ""The Jericho Mile"".",1014768000,10,647,4.89908256880734
212406,5,6300151875,"Watching this made-for-TV movie set in Folsom Penitentiary, one is suddenly struck by the fact that realistic prison dialogue and violence can be accomplished without profanity or graphic gore.  Amazing.  And it's such a watchable movie, featuring a sexy performance by a young and sinewy Peter Strauss, and a rousing musical theme remniscent of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"".  Strauss is Rain Murphy, a lifer/loner who does his time running in the Yard.  He turns in fast miles, in basketball shoes on uneven grass.  With decent equipment and a little coaching, he might have a shot at an Olympic title.  But first he'll need to qualify on an Olympic track -- and a convicted murderer, even a ""model"" inmate like Murphy, can't get a furlough just for a tryout.  So Folsom officials decide to build one within prison walls.  ""The Jericho Mile"" was filmed on location, utilizing the real prison population as extras.  The racetrack was actually constructed on-camera by convict labor.  Racial strife is a theme of the film, as white inmate Murphy and his black running partner Stiles attract unwanted attention from the Aryan, Muslim, and Chicano gangs vying for ""political"" supremacy.  Will the dream of convict Gold unite the warring factions?  Ironically, ""The Jericho Mile"" actually did, however briefly. This most racially turbulent California penitentiary experienced unprecedented harmony during the filming of the movie.  The track built by the interracial work brigade is still there for the use of other Rain Murphys behind the walls.",987897600,51,1558,5.184

7803672,5,6300151875,"I  first saw this movie when it came out on TV and a couple of other times in later years. I consider it among the absolute best movies that I have ever seen. When I first watched it I was in training for a possible job that required me to run a mile and a half in 11 1/2  minutes with my best time being 8 minutes at that date. The movie so inspired me that i immediately ran it in  6 1/2 minutes. But I wasn't about to throw my stop watch against the wall.
  In later years I became an RN and had the opportunity to WORK at 4 different prisons, for four years, in three different states and some of what was in the movie is a bit exaggerated from the real life Maximum Security that I worked in but then that's typical for Hollywood.
  The one thing that really ANGERS  me is the price of $32.00 for a Made For TV Movie when you can purchase OSCAR Winning movies for $5.00 - $10.00. (
Don't get me wrong though, this is an superior movie)",1420848000,,940,3.9627659574468086
7803673,2,6300151875,"The Jericho Mile was a TV movie made in 1979 for ABC. Having not seen it in 35 years, I was looking forward to watching it again after I bought it and played it on my region free player. Well...memory is a funny thing; I remember it being just awesome--but it wasn't. I'm a runner, and I like Peter Strause but this movie isn't very good and the VHS/DVD transfer is pretty poor. It has no 'menu' it just starts when you put the disc in and I had to have the volume maxed out just to hear the dialogue. Peter Strause plays a condemned killer who 'distracts himself' by running in the yard at Folsom Prison. Peter looks pretty convincing as a runner tho his 'style' is more 400, 800 meters runner than miler but I digress. We get lots of scenes of Peter running shirtless in the film if that appeals to you but it doesn't add to the story for me. He has a ""Brian's Song"" type relationship with another inmate who runs with him who is black and a gang/retribution storyline also gets played out in the film. Most of the acting seems pretty 'over the top' by today's standards with Brian Dennehey in particular pretty ridiculous as the leader of the white supremacists who don't care for Peter Strause character anymore than anybody else. The film gets a little 'preachy' when Strause goes before a sort of athletic 'parole board' to decide if he can run in the Olympic Trials. He doesn't run for ""Olympic Gold"" as the cover of the DVD would have you think and in the end Strause decides to run his own Olympic Trials inside the prison and then break his stopwatch for good after as if to say ""up yours"" to the Man. The movie doesn't ""succeed"" as a prison film; a buddy flick; or a sports movie but it did start the career of director Michael Mann who has made some really awesome films since. And Peter Strause? Well....",1406332800,2,1817,4.347058823529411
