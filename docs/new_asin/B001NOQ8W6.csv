8327526,5,B001NOQ8W6,"Outstanding video and one I recommend even for a church setting. Straight forward prophecy teaching video about the restoration of the Jews to the land as taught by a dedicated Bible-believing evangelical teacher. Avoids pet doctrines, Hebrew Roots Movement tangents, politics and other distracters that normally ruin DVDs on this subject. Get it for your personal study, Bible study group or church.",1486425600,,400,5.467741935483871

8327530,5,B001NOQ8W6,With all the strife in the Middle East I am always interested in seeing how past prophesies affect our present day lives and this video was a very good eye opener and a good source of information that I had not seen in other DVD's. If you are interested in world affairs and how they may be developing and possibly affect your life ..this is a good buy,1402617600,2,352,4.1911764705882355
8327531,5,B001NOQ8W6,"I ordered this DVD on a risky whim, not expecting much. This is because I had previously heard of neither the producers, the narrators, nor even the distributors. Besides that, I haven't been impressed much with other documentaries or even the several  books I've read on the subject. But this 50-minute documentary by whoever-they-are is impressively made and jammed with information, much of which I had never heard before. If you are interested in the ""Old Testament,"" prophecy, or Israeli history and politics, this should be in your library. It's cornerstone caliber and visually beautiful. My only criticism is that the sound volume as programmed on the disc is inconsistent...plan on keeping your remote in hand with finger on the volume button throughout the show. In spite of that, it's it's WELL worth getting if you have interest in the subject. And you will, when watching this.",1268784000,9,890,5.054421768707483
