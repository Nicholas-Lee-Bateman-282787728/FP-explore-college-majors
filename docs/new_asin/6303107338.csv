563632,5,6303107338,"This is one of my all-time favorite films.  It is pretty slow-paced for the modern audience, and the subtitles are a barrier to enjoyment for some people. For me, however, the pace and subtitles are part of the exotic ambience of the film.  A knight and his squire are returning to Europe after about ten years away in the Crusades. They are returning to a Europe that is being devastated by the Black Death, a disease of bubonic plague that ravaged Europe (25%-50% are estimated to have died from it) in the mid-14th century (it's a bit late as far as ""returning from the Crusades"").  They are headed for Elsinore (in Denmark) where the knight's castle is. He does not know if his wife is alive or dead, or what he will find.  I won't repeat the story line, but the stark theological/philosophical themes of life v. death, God v. Satan, sophisticated, experienced worldview v. innocent and nave worldview, hope v. despair, and God v. atheism all bring this film to the cutting edge where art and metaphysics meet.",1447718400,3,1014,4.648044692737431

564017,5,6303107338,"Most movies set in medieval days involve saturated colors, enormous amounts of swordfighting, and maybe a black plague thrown in for dramatic tension. The Seventh Seal tackles the same era - with the same plague fears - from a completely different angle.

The Seventh Seal Released in 1957 by famed director Ingmar Bergman, The Seventh Seal is a Swedish-language film which is set in Sweden. Fantastic actor Max von Sydow plays Antonius Block, a weary knight who has been away fighting in the Crusades for ten long years. He is finally returning with his grumpy but obedient-enough squire, Jons. All the two want to do is go home. Unfortunately for Antonius, the very moment his foot steps on his home soil, Death arrives in the guise of a tall, pale man in a black cloak. If you've seen Monty Python or Bill & Ted, you've seen parodies of this. Death wants to take Antonius away, but Antonius counters with an idea. If Antonius can beat Death in chess, Antonius gets to go free. Death, intrigued, agrees.

What follows is Antonius and Jons working their way across a rural landscape, encountering various people, as the chess game progresses. We learn just why Antonius is trying to delay his sentence via this game and how much the ravages of war have impacted him. There are a variety of shades of grey in the characters we encounter. One man is happy to run off with another man's wife. She goes merrily - but her tune changes when she's caught and blames it all on the guy. Characters are beaten up for little reason. And all around them the plague is coming. They don't know why, and some feel it's God's punishment on them. Others merely want to survive. People are accused of being witches. But some manage to hold out hope.

For those who thrive on intense battle scenes, it's important to point out that this isn't that kind of movie. It's black and white and it's more about thoughtful conversation than hacking someone's head off. That's not to say it's monotone. Characters absolutely feel with great passion. The cuckolded husband rages with passion and grief. The mother dreams of a better life for her child. Each character has his or her own view on life, death, and what makes it all worthwhile.

From a medieval point of view, it's an interesting view into the various mindsets that could have existed when something as potent and inexplicable as the Black Plague descends onto a landscape. But beyond that, I'd be gentle with expecting authenticity. The outfits are more like costumes for a play. The places they go are similarly often more like play stages than authentic locations. The timing of various events here with real life events doesn't match up. Things seen here didn't exist in Sweden at the time. So this film was never meant to recreate medieval times. It was more that the backdrop of the black plague helped provide an atmosphere to address common fears and worries we all have about life in general.

Still, that's more an alert for medieval fans than to say the movie suffers as a result. It is more a fantasy film, set in ""olden times"", as a way to help us explore a variety of universal human concerns and issues.

Highly recommended.",1395532800,7,3175,4.681003584229391

564157,3,6303107338,"Many of these ""classic"" films (eg Bicycle Thieves, Rashomon, Seventh Seal) don't translate well to a modern audience. While I admired the theme and attempt at making a serious work of art, most of the scenes in this film were just plain hokey. I did enjoy the three primary characters: knight, squire, and death -- and the scenes with the knight and death were excellent. (The death character was acted brilliantly.) But the rest of the cast and their scenes were pretty painful to watch. I wanted to fast forward on several occasions.

For enjoyment value, this film gets 2 stars; but 5 stars for effort. This is the kind of film that's better to ""have seen"" than ""to see."" In retrospect, you forget about the mediocre parts and remember those great images of the knight and death conversing and playing chess.

When people rank this as one of the greatest films of all time, it's like ranking Rod Laver as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. His level of play in 1969 wouldn't even get him on the pro tour today. Athletes are fitter, stronger, faster, and more skilled than in his era. I feel the same way about this film. It was probably important in its day, but the art of film making moved to another level since then. I would rank a ton of Hollywood films of the 70s (for me the height of American film making) over this one. eg Cuckoo's Nest, Taxi Driver, The Conversation, Chinatown, Dog Day Afternoon, Godfather, Deliverance",1379116800,5,1446,4.579150579150579

564160,5,6303107338,"""The Seventh Seal"" opens famously with a long shot of gathering clouds with a still, hovering eagle, gliding portentously against a dark grey sky looking down upon a desolate landscape. The music blares out in rising crescendo ending with a wail of singing reminiscent of Mahler's Second Symphony. Another long shot of a beach at dusk with the voice over of a prophetic warning from The ""Book of Revelation"" sets the peculiar tone of this medieval world on the verge of being devoured by the plague:

""When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them...Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.""

With this biblical context in place the film's narrative is put squarely in the fire and brimstone prose of the ""Book of Revelation"". After this unsettling opening we are introduced to Antonius Block, a Knight, who has had a tough sojourn at the Crusades in the Holy Land. Block is now resting, his eyes closed in a rare moment of leisure. Block is then showed playing chess with his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bj&ouml;rnstrand), but Jons seems uninterested. Antonius  is still intensely engaged with the game, when Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has been stalking the plague-ridden land to claim lives, walks towards Antonius to claim him.  Block's chess game had just turned into a strategic battle of ideas between good and evil, life and death, meaning and meaninglessness. When Death has put him on notice the knight pleads for time. Antonius Block is not afraid to die, his spirit his willing, but his flesh is weak.  He realizes that there is more work to be done in his life with his quest only beginning as he seeks to answer the ultimate questions of meaning. He challenges Death to a game of chess and convinces him that the victor should decide on whether he dies or lives on. Death obliges.

The scene with the Knight and Death shown in profile playing a strategic game of wits is among the more iconic scenes of World Cinema, certainly the most recognizable scene in Scandinavian Cinema. This first round of chess with Death ultimately allows Antonius and Jons to move on. Death is postponed for Block when he wins this first round. They journey through the wild and grim landscape of a medieval world  ravaged by plague in search for answers.

The Chess motif and the impending doom that awaits Block and his friends builds this film into a dense, brooding, performance. The atmosphere of the film is charged with an existential angst as Block desperately clings on to make good on his new lease on life. The warring contestants, the Knight and Death, attempting to upstage each other is set against the backdrop of a world where priests and monks fill the landscape preaching fear. They attempt to preach repentance and formulate a cure for pestilence with penance and self-flagellation.  The ground and air are strewn with holy water, incense, to keep evil at bay.

Antonius and Jons walk through this grim landscape questioning the existence of God in the face of the plague. The specter of the Crusades, why Antonius was in it, given the harsh realities of the world opening up before them, is a haunting presence. Block ardently wants to believe that death cannot be the final answer, while Jons has resigned himself to death's impending victory. Jons's cynicism is fueled further after his conversation with a mural painter at Church with the artist's terrible insight into life and death as it is brought out in his paintings. The painter is a cynical observer of a world where monks and priests rule only to spread more fear and superstition. The painter has not only documented the ravages of the plague but has also attempted to offer meaning for all this suffering.

This idea of personifying death in The Seventh Seal is inspired. Bergman, like his great contemporary Tarkovksii who also looked to a medieval artist for inspiration, got his initial inspiration for this script, one of his greatest, from one of the great medieval frescoes, ""Death playing chess"", by Albertus Pictor (1440-1507) now at the T&auml;by kyrka, a Diocese of Stockholm.

Bengt Ekerot as ""Death"" is no skull and bones figure like the image of ""Death"" in that medieval fresco. Instead Death is a meticulously robed figure in black with his face in white mask with Bengt Ekerot's bulging, severe, glowing eyes, set in striking contrast to the always tragic eyes of the Knight. Death is a living, breathing, mesmeric presence, who claims his victims by hypnotizing them into a careless  ease. Ekerot cuts a worthy, even brutally dignified, figure on screen and is a worthy complement to the austerely severe tragic countenance of Max Von Sydow's knight.

Antonius Block's tragic sensibility imbues the film with much of its poetry. The brooding processionals of the crucifixion, the terrible plight of a young girl condemned to the stake, and the relentless pursuit of Block and his ever increasing group of fellow sojourners and friends by Death make this unforgettable cinema. But the doom is often punctuated by the innocent and lightness of the only actor in this troupe, who is also a seer, poet, and a visionary. The delightful ""actor"" Jof, played by Nils Poppe, and his wife Mia, played by Bibi Andersson, and their infant, Mikael, are a ray of light in this grey and somber world. The lyrical music of Jof's harp, Mia's pure love for him, and their delight in their son and in life itself, bring consolation and much needed relief to this demon weary world. They are also a  relief to Antonius Block's strained mind. Block revels in their company and his spirit is lightened for once in a touching conversation with Mia, over milk and strawberries. This is the more endearing side of Bergman, this delight in life brought to screen with unforgettable lyricism and humor, and it as though we have temporarily landed in the enticing and innocent world of Bergman's  ""Wild Strawberries"" and his ""Smiles of a Summer Night"".

Death gets impatient with Antonius's strategy of postponing the next round of the chess game that will decide his fate. After Death discovers a new weakness in Antonius Block, his growing love for his friends, especially Jof, Mia, and their infant child Mikael, Death hints that unless Block complies with his request and meets him for a deciding round of chess, he will shift his attention to claiming the happiness of his new friends. Antonius's anguish, his dilemma, and his tortuous and searching soul ever seeking answers, make this film a grand allegory of Bergman's own quest as an artist in the films to come. The dramatic images put on film, right up to that last dance with death, reminiscent of the silhouette picture films of Lotte Reiniger, has a nightmarish clarity. This last scene will be the fulfillment of the Church painter's vision and prophecy that was revealed to Jons earlier in the film.  Gunnar Fischer, the brilliant cinematographer, does his magic to make this among the most lavish black and white films in existence.

""The Seventh Seal"" has some of Ingmar Bergman's most inspired writing, in turns lyric, funny, brooding, and defiant. The script is his grandest rebellion against God and life, and as eloquent and memorable a testament of life and death, as we can hope to have on film. This is an impassioned protest against life and death, of the brooding Ivan Karamazov variety, with Bergman displaying as much flair for invective writing and bold images as the stark passages in that incomparable Dostoevsky novel ""The Brothers Karamazov"".",1358812800,4,7640,4.87211093990755

564165,5,6303107338,"This remarkable film is based on the sight in Bergman's pastor father's church of a painting of Death playing chess with a Knight. The screenplay broadens the subject into a road movie. Also, Carl Orff's Carmen Burana,itself inspired by medieval songs written by minstrels,who during the plague and bloody wars,joined the big,wandering crowds of homeless men and women,scholars, monks and jesters traipsing across Europe. They created songs of hope sung at church festivals and fairs. The idea of people travelling through the downfall of civilization and culture, giving birth to new songs. We also know Bergman was influenced in some of the settings e.g the sea-lashed coast and actors travelling to Elsinore and a castle to Olivier's Hamlet. Lastly,Picasso's painting Acrobats. After the comedies of the 50s,Bergman turned to films framed by the fear of death and questions of faith(or not) in God, including Virgin Spring,also set in the Middle Ages.

The apocalyptic title from the Book of Revelation,conjures up the Middle Ages,where the fear of the Plague translates into our very modern fear of the atomic bomb,prevalent in the 50s and 60s. Antonius Block(Sydow)a knight returning from the Crusades after 10 years with his squire Jons(Bjornstrand)to 14th century Sweden,tormented and doubting,Death(Ekerot)comes to claim him. Block,to ward Death off,challenges him to a game of chess,seeking to obtain knowledge before he dies. This iconic image set the template for world cinema. Bergman continues this game of life and death around the country,he expands the concept exploring a variety of themes. God is in Block's heart(as piety was in child Bergman's)and he wishes to evict him. God does not reveal himself. Block wants knowledge not faith. Life is a `preposterous horror'if nothing is beyond death. God is the idol of fear. After meeting a group of travelling players,Mia (Andersson),Jof,a religious mystic and their child,Block feels a need to protect their simple joy and affirmation of life by guiding them through the woods. They share milk and strawberries.

This balances the nihilism of God's absence and the barbarism of medieval times,the fanatical troups of self-flagellating worshippers and the witch-burning. Jons sees the pointlessness of the Crusades when their chief propagandist,Raval,is spied robbing corpses. He's unmoved by the prevailing gloom,the `ghost story' of the Trinity. Block wishes to drop the `heavy burden'of faith. Skat,the adulterer,escaping from the blacksmith climbs a tree to have it sawn down by Death. This medieval world is complete with tavern fights and storm-lit castles. The reaper is creeping into the background of every view,scenes of the travelling minstrels,players,blacksmith and wife and most of all Block and Jons. This extraordinary film carries broad cinematic thrills and theatrical flourishes,the cinematography captures characters at peace in soft light,while harsh overexposed film shows anxiety and moral doubt and stunning vistas in between. The two opposing beliefs of childhood piety and harsh rationalism are embodied in Block and Jons. Then against this the holiness of human beings,the family,within the earthly realm,with the child as bringing about the miracle. The Seventh Seal is a strangely hopeful film,shot through with humour. Bergman's film unleashed a new existentialist phase in world cinema. Shakesperean. And the dance of death.",1305936000,2,3419,5.56046065259117

564286,5,6303107338,"Since I live in Sweden, I find it difficult to review this movie. Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece ""The Seventh Seal"" has been shown innumerable times on Swedish television, until it has become a pop culture phenomenon (the movie is parodied as often in Sweden as in the US or Britain). Also, the actors speak with a very old fashioned diction and enunciation, making the movie involuntarily humorous to modern viewers - provided you understand Swedish.

As a kid, I intensely disliked ""The Seventh Seal"". I was bored by it, and considered the plot incomprehensible. There are also scenes that resemble those of a horror movie. As a history-obsessed adult, I was more struck by the anachronisms. The main character, Antonius Block, is a knight returning from the crusades in Palestine. However, the plot is obviously set during the 1350's, at the time of the Black Death. By then, Palestine had been in Muslims hands for generations. The last crusader stronghold, Acre, fell already in 1291. And while crazy flagellants may have existed even in Sweden, they are usually associated with Spain. Some also claim that the chess game in the movie is played according to modern rather than medieval rules. But the most obvious anachronism is that neither Antonius nor his squire Jns seems to believe in God - an impossibility in medieval Europe. Indeed, Block sounds like a modern existentialist!

But then, that's the point...

""The Seventh Seal"" is really a philosophical movie about the human condition. The medieval setting is symbolic. Indeed, I suspect Ingmar Bergman quite deliberately chose a stereotyped, dark image of the Middle Ages as a backdrop to his story. There is also an obvious contrast between the medieval darkness, Block's existential anxiety and the lighter attitude of some of the other characters.

So what is the message, then? Despite the morbidly dark atmosphere (made worse by the fact that the movie is black and white), ""The Seventh Seal"" is actually quite optimistic. I took me years to really realize it, though.

Antonius Block gets in serious trouble already at the start of the story, when Death himself comes to take him away. During a classical stand off, Block challenges Death to a game of chess. If Block wins, he and his companions are free to go. If he looses, they will all die, but the game will at least have bought Block some time to solve the riddle of existence. During the respite, Block and Jns journey through an absurd, apocalyptic landscape. Old scores are settled and some villains are roughed up. Block becomes friendly with two travelling actors, Jof and Mia, who seem to symbolize purity and innocence. (The names Jof and Mia are an obvious reference to the Biblical Joseph and Mary, ""Josef"" and ""Maria"" in Swedish.) Naturally, Death wants to kill both Jof, Mia and their little toddler (Baby Jesus?). At the last moment, the knight attempts to cheat in the chess game, thereby distracting Death, which enables the actors to get away to safety. Death eventually wins the game, but Block is satisfied nevertheless: he will die, but at least he saved Jof, Mia and their child. At the end of the movie, the entire landscape virtually lightens up, as Jof and Mia come out of the dark woods. Even the death of Block and his travel companions is suddenly seen from a more optimistic angle, as Jof retells a vision of how the knightly travelling party is dancing in the skies. Although led by Death to an uncertain fate, Block is somehow the winner. He failed during the ""holy"" crusades, and even lost his faith in God, but as a last act, he at least saved the innocent and pure.

564290,5,6303107338,"Of Ingmar Bergman's early black and white films, The Seventh Seal (1957) is my personal favorite. The story takes place in the middle of the 12th century. The black plague strikes Europe. A knight (Max von Sydow) and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) return from the Crusades: the Crusades were a series of military campaigns by western European Christians to recover the Holy Land from the Saracen Muslims. The ocean delivers Antonius and his squire to a beach. The sky is half lit; the ocean is restless; the sun is almost under the horizon. A black bird--a scavenger--hangs over Antonius. He prays. But he and his squire are not alone. Nearby stands a tall figure in a long black robe. His face is pale and familiar--he is Death. Antonius is ready, but first he must challenge Death to a game of chess. If Death prevails, Antonius dies; if Antonius prevails, Death must allow him to live. Death agrees; his chess figures are black. The game begins.

Death and the chessboard vanish, the sun burns overhead, and once again, Antonius and his squire are alone on the beach. They find two stray horses and begin their inland journey. Deeper inland, they encounter symbols of death and danger. The clouds are light and unable to cool the sun. Antonius and his squire encounter the corpse of a monk. They stroll past an old rundown wagon. Three troubadours--Jof (Nils Pope), his wife, Mia (Bibi Andersson), and Skat (Erik Strandmark)--sleep inside the wagon. They will travel to the Saint's Festival in Elsinor, and the lead actor shall play the role of Death in a play on the church steps. Antonius and his squire visit the church in Elsinor. There, an artist is painting a fresco. Within this fresco, Death leads a ghoulish parade of corpses. The knight, Antonius Block, notices a priest inside of a small room. There, Block alleviates his conscience. Iron bars separate Antonius and the priest in the chamber who bears Antonius's confession. A black cloak obscures the priests face. Antonius speaks freely. His whole life has been meaningless. Is there a God? Antonius tells the priest of his scheme to stall Death with a game of chess. The chess game is a respite for Antonius to search out the meaning of life on earth. Antonius's confession amuses the priest. Antonius discloses his strategy: he shall outmaneuver Death with a bishop and a knight. Hearing this, the priest rises from his seat and shows his face: the priest is Death--the Knight has been fooled! Round one to Death.

And so the story progresses. Most of Bergman's early films-- Wild Strawberries, Smiles of a Summer Night, The Virgin Spring, etc.--were allegorical. The Seventh Seal is the best known of his earlier films, all of which were done in black and white. I loved this film the first time I saw it. Bergman's films and characters speak to you. Bibi Andersson--who plays one of the traveling troubadours in the film-- has starred in many of Bergman's early black and white films such as The Seventh Seal, Smiles of a Summer Night, and the Magician. Also, she has starred in many of Bergman's latter color films such as Scenes From a Marriage and Persona. Max von Sydow starred in several of Bergman's earlier films. The Seventh Seal is a glass of wine--drink it and enjoy.

564291,4,6303107338,"One of the things that separates a great artist from a lesser one is his ability to switch forms, themes, and the like, yet still imprint that unmistakable essence that lets a viewer know which artist they are dealing with immediately. Rarely has there been a greater and more vivid example of this reality than in comparing the two films Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman released in 1957: The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries.
  The first film, which is the subject of this essay, is stark, cosmic, spare, allegorical, and unremitting in its view of life, whereas Wild Strawberries is rich, personal, realistic (even if it uses symbolism), and open to several viable interpretations. Both films starred many of Bergman's `stock actors from the 1950s: Max Von Sydow as Knight Antonius Block, Bibi Andersson as Mia, the wife of Jof the jester (and utterly gorgeous, as opposed to mere cuteness in Wild Strawberries), and Gunnar Bjrnstrand as Block's squire Jns, a pragmatic Sancho Panza to Block's spiritual Don Quixote. While Bjrnstrand is nominally the third lead in the film, behind Sydow and Bengt Ekerot as the personification of Death, in truth he is the dominant lead character, with by far the most, and the best, lines of dialogue. And while this film is an allegory loaded with symbolism, it is also a very simple story of a middle 14th Century knight's return to Sweden from the Crusades of the Middle Ages....  The acting is uniformly excellent. Sydow is utterly transparent as Block. We see every cranny of doubt and belief written on his face. Poppe, as Jof, shows what Roberto Benigni might be like, if he had a dram of depth, Ekerot's Death is frightening only in his pomp and banality, but Bjrnstrand gives a truly great performance in the most difficult of the roles- treading between comedy and drama, realism and absurdism, as the squire who seems to be the wisest of all the characters. While this film was made at the height of the early Cold War, and many early reviewers took the Plague as an allegory for nuclear war, the film is far more than a simplistic political screed. At 96 minutes it also is not tool long that it batters the viewer with its message, nor too short that it slips quickly by. This film proves why black and white is still a vital tool in filmmaking. Had it been shot in color its dreamy quality would be rent, for shadows and depth are far easier to portray in black and white, and are far more suggestive of moodiness and inner turmoil. One problem is that the DVD version of the film I have, from The Criterion Collection, errs in allowing the black and white English words to be used, rather than colorizing them for clearer and speedier reading, thus detracting from the visual cornucopia onscreen. This is why watching the film, a second time, with or without comments, is recommended, for many visual subtleties are revealed that are lost in a first viewing's necessity to read the dialogue
  All in all, it's little wonder why speed-addicted, and Lowest Common Denominator afflicted American viewers have never taken to films like this, of such high quality. Yes, the writing is spare, but it is not meant to be realistic, and some of the imagery, and acting is straight out of silent German Expressionism, which only reinforces the revery-like feel of the film. And while Americans are noted for cherishing their dreams as hopes, how few ever recall their dreams as theater?",1221868800,,3431,4.779089376053963
564292,4,6303107338,"Made in 1956, in black and white, this film was one of the first ones ever to explore the topic of death.  Fans of Ingmar Bergman know that director explored the meaning of death in his work.  Born and raised in a strict and religious family, Bergman was intrigued about the mysteries of life and death, purpose of life and meaning of punishment.  This film, placed in 14th century Sweden immediately after Crusades were over and Black Plague decimated the population of Europe, explores exploitative power of religion., pristhood and church, hardship of life for artists and actors and one knight's desire to elude death until he finds answers to his own questions about life and death; purpose of life; belief in God and other existential questions.  In attempt to gain time, he bargains with death to buy in some more time while playing the game of chess. He is hoping that finding answers would give him hope on his life spent on earth and also help him save a young family from doom in hopes that perhaps the next generation will find a greater purpose.  We learn that search is futile and that there is no barganing with death.  We all receive death and our final hours differently just as we are all unique individuals and as such live our lives on earth.  Some of us are ready and resigned to it, some scared, some fearful, others welcoming of death as a means of our begining of the new life.  Just like life, death turns out what we make of it.  It is unavoidable and part of every living being.  It cannot be denied, talked out of it, bargained with or postponed.  It comes at its own time on its own terms and releases itself into a new day.  It gives a different kind of hope to humanity and still leaves many unanswered questions.  It eventually gets us all: evil ones, meek ones, righteous ones and cynical ones.  We only hope it will release us into something eternally good and not turn into perpetual punishment for our ignorance.",1220313600,4,1948,4.544412607449857

In terms of asking the question, ""Is there meaning in life and Is there a God?,"" no other film dares to so boldly ask such questions and give such existential answers.  There appears to be a Mother Mary and a Christ Child, but there's also Death in this film, and Death, disguised as Clergy, or with the help of ignorant people as well as the clergy, tortures people wholesale in this film.  Each person in this film tries to find meaning in his or her own way, as a Knight playing chess with Death tries to find the meaning of his life, before losing and dying to Death at the end of the chess match.  At first, the Knight, Antonius Block, appears to have the upper hand in the match, as we do when we feel young and strong, but by the end of the film, as near the end of our lives, Death has the upper hand.  In the end, the Knight finds meaning by appearing to help a young family escape Death, but I'm not sure if Death made it appear that Death lost the family just to let the Knight have some meaning before his own end.  I highly recommend the film in case you haven't already seen it if you wish to explore these religious questions of meaning and ""Does God exist?,"" all mixed in with life during the Middle Ages with a Crusade, and a Plague to boot to get people to thinking. . .Don't be put off that the film has sub-titles.

BEWARE SPOILERS

It really is impossible to consider an Ingmar Bergman movie without immediately running to an interpretation.  At least for me that is the case.  In particular The Seventh Seal seems to demand that we ask what was Bergman's intention.  Was it to show that Christianity and superstition are brothers in arms?  Was it to suggest a kind of fatalism that allows some to live and others to die without rhyme or reason?

The story, set in the 14th century during the time of plague, concerns a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) lately returned to Sweden from the Crusades.  Bergman combines realism with supernatural elements, such as the appearance of Death (Bengt Ekerot) with whom Antonius Block plays a game of chess, and the visions that the traveling troubadour, Jof (Nils Poppe) sees that nobody else can see including his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson).  Block is haunted by death and has been assured that death is imminent, but hopes to put it off by beating Death at chess.

Meanwhile the inhabitants are also in fear of death and seek to blame someone.  They seize a young girl (Maud Hansson) and brand her a witch for consorting with the Evil One.  They hold her in a pillory prior to burning her at the stake.  Notice that instead of denying that she has been with the devil, she tells us that she reaches out and touches him everywhere.  The only bright spot in the movie is the family of Jof, Mia and their infant son.

Antonius Block goes to confession only to discover that the priest behind the window is none other than his adversary Death, to whom he inadvertently reveals his strategy in their game of chess.  Block is searching for the meaning of life.  He is trying to find God, whom he complains is always hiding.  Instead he finds Death.  Can they be one and the same?  Jons is able and cynical and sees through humanity's many delusions.  Jof plays at life and sings.  Mia is filled with love for life.  Guess who lives and who dies.

But of course the plague was the great leveler.  Persons of stations high and low were brought within its compass, but Bergman gets to pick and choose who shall live and who shall die.

As usual with Bergman we have the most incredible study of human faces.  I particularly liked the close ups of the women.  The face of Gunnel Lindblom, who plays the young woman (""Girl"" in the credits) that Jons saves from being raped, is particularly striking and intense.  I recall her from The Virgin Spring (1960) in which she played Ingeri, the Odin-worshipping servant.  The face of Bibi Andersson is a delight with her quick, pretty eyes and her engaging smile.

But Bergman also concentrates on the faces of the bit players, in the mead hall and at the burning and as they watch the traveling players at their song and dance.  With Bergman people are intensely real, up close and always personal.  And he knows what they think and how they act.  He shows us here, as he does in all his films, human hypocrisy and stupidity, human love and frailty.  The landscape is bleak, the shadows are dark and life is harsh.  Humans take their quick pleasures and then they die.  That is the message I think that Bergman is sending to us.

No student of film should miss this, one of the most talked about films ever made, and perhaps Bergman's first great work of art.  He died only recently in 2007, not long after being voted (In Time Magazine, I think) as the greatest living director.",1211673600,6,3640,4.558641975308642

The black plague is sweeping across the country.  Many are dead or dying.  During his voyage, the Knight comes across a hooded figure who reveals himself to be Death incarnate.  What does the Knight do?  He challenges Death to a game of chess!  The game is on...

As the Knight continues on his journey, we intercut between his observations of a decaying world, individuals trying to thrive the best they can and his game with Death.  The various characters are given near equal treatment.  We see the world through the eyes of a believer, a cynic, the ignorant, the superstitious, the self-centered, the misanthrope and the protector.

This is a story with powerful images and metaphors.  The existence of God, the meaning of life and what death holds for us all are questions carefully woven into the fabric of its telling.

This is a minimalist film where Bergman respects the audience enough to let us decide the truth for ourselves.  Various interpretations are ensured.

[It's a 4:3 aspect ratio film, shot in black & white, with Swedish dialogue.  English dubbing and subtitles are available.  It won the Cannes in 1957 and is widely considered Bergman's best film.]

""Death is like a freight train in the future, heading toward us, closing the hours, second by second...  If we're to live with any sense of satisfaction, we must engage life's forces of antagonism before the train arrives."" - Robert McKee",1206576000,7,1600,4.862962962962963
564363,5,6303107338,"Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde Inseglet) is a true masterpiece of world cinema. For years I avoided Bergman due to the perception that the master was gloomy and hard to watch. Having seen both The Magician and The Seventh Seal I have changed my view radically.

The subject matter is dense but presented in a fresh and even earthy way. A knight, Antonious Block (Max von Sydow) and his squire Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand) have retured home to Sweden following the Crusades. Sweden is in the throes of the Middle Ages and the plague rages. While Block is waiting to begin his journey to his castle he meets Death (Bengt Ekerot) and challenges him to a game of chess. The hope is to delay death long enough that he may do one truly good deed. Along the way we meet a troupe of actors which includes a small family:Jof (Nils Poppe)his wife Mia (the stunning Bibi Andersson) and their small son Michael.

The true question posed by the film is the meaning of life. Is there a God and what is his place in the world. Does Death provide answers or only more questions. This is a film that demands great attention but one that also provides great rewards to its viewers.

I watched the Criterion edition which provides perhaps a better transfer than audiences saw in 1957. A commentary by film historian Peter Cowie. An Illustrated filmography for Bergman and a restoration demonstration.

This is one film that demands to be seen and should be part of the backbone of any serious film collection. Buy it.",1203552000,6,1520,4.618518518518519
564364,5,6303107338,"There are 'movies' and there are 'films'. Moviemakers are the producers, the Hollywood executives with numbers and the bottom line continually in their field of focus. Their movies, constructed by formulaic directors are meant for big numbers. There is no real art to their product, it is another 'distraction' for those with nothing to do on a Friday or Saturday night. These movies rely on people's boredom for profit. The movies make a big splash, take in the profit and slide towards obscurity.

Then there are filmmakers. Ingmar Bergman is the filmmaker par excellence. It took over a dozen films before he finally arrived at a hit, namely the great Swedish-Shakespearean comedy, Smiles of a Summer Night.

The Seventh Seal is his primary film. I watched this movie when I was twenty-one years old on Christmas day (twice actually...I made my father and step-mother watch it with me...nothing like a little bit of egg nog and a procession of black-and-white flagellants to heighten the Christmas spirit.) I was a bit of a misanthrope at the time, a hardened-cynic. I feel I have changed but the film, each time I watch it, I find something new. I feel this was my transition film, the great piece of cinematic art that made me aware that the movie screen can actually produce works of merit.

In a recent Scandinavian literature class, we read the works of Ibsen and Strindberg and watched several films of Bergman. You can't deny the latter's place in the world of literature. He may appear dark and morose but in the Jungian sense, being aware of your shadow, owning your dark side is a lot better than denying it. Bergman was well aware of his inner darkness. I would call this film a classic because it goes beyond the basic standards of telling a story through the medium of celluloid. Life is complex, and if you keep going from rom-com or blow-em up blockbusters your entire life, you may have never really see how fascinating and immense the examined life is.

This film is the place to begin if you want to know more about foreign productions. Start here and you'll never stop exploring.",1203120000,6,2101,4.747945205479452
564365,5,6303107338,"Crusader, Antonious Block (Max Von Sydow) and his squire Jns (Gunnar Bjrnstrand) have returned home after ten years.  Unfortunately, thorough chaos and the black plague await them.  Block himself comes face to face with a human manifestation of Death (Bengt Ekerot).  Death has come for him and during Block's trials over the last ten years he has felt his faith in God diminish.  Block challenges Death to a game of chess that plays on throughout the entire film.  We wonder if his expectations are to actually outwit Death and survive.  During his many interactions with Death he asks for true knowledge of God's existence and therefore some guidance as to his own.  He is conflicted and to some degree he views the concept of God as merely an idol created to pacify fear and doom.  These are just a few of the many insights that make their confrontation so enticing.  Block's squire Jns seems to acknowledge and exist in this oblivion and acts as humanity's voice of helplessness to Block.  Block likely knows his death is forthcoming but is playing his game of chess as a way to delay the inevitable.  The delay allows him to reunite with his wife and to further ponder on the existence of God.  But most importantly, it is all a way for him to express and examine his utter dissatisfaction with the possibility that life has absolutely no meaning at all.

I was first exposed to some of Ingmar Bergman's work when I was in my teens.  Back then I only thought I understood Bergman.  I was wrong; with Bergman there is always some new guidance to provide further appreciation for life.  Unfortunately, this outstanding director passed away in July of 2007. I felt obligated to buy Criterion's release of Bergman's masterpiece The Seventh Seal.  I've seen the Seventh Seal three times.  The first time without really paying attention but just kind of suspecting it was something special, this was years ago in my late teens.  The other two times I watched it alone and both times I became consumed by it; once as a pious Christian and once as a skeptical agnostic.  I saw the film in a dramatically different light with each viewing but yet it was still a great experience.  Needless to say, if you've seen The Seventh Seal and not felt that your faith or lack thereof is being questioned and tugged at then you may need to watch it again.  In the end, I found a satisfying resolution either way and the film is both personal and universal in it's commentary, so you may too.  It is interesting to note that The Seventh Seal never tries to directly answer Block's questions and almost anyone could walk away satisfied with the conclusion.  The Seventh Seal isn't necessarily about God and faith directly, but really just the aspects that produce them.  The experience of life and finding comfort in our own personal existence is something only the ignorant or indifferent could look away from, and they may be the only ones unsatisfied with The Seventh Seal's conclusion.  As a character Block is anything but ignorant or indifferent.  He is more alive and passionate throughout the film because he knows full well he is in Death's grip and he wants to know if his actions in life are worth anything.  This is a hugely significant film that tackles hugely significant subject matter and does so without preaching at us.  It even uses some humor in doses at just the right time.  I'm hopeful that one day a film like this could be produced again but somehow I see cinema going in a very different direction.

The DVD release itself is a very good one and I definitely recommend the Criterion release.  The film has been restored enough to appreciate the cinematography for the time and budget, and there are also some great extras that really help to put Bergman's film career in perspective.  I can honestly say that no film affected me like The Seventh Seal and I am a Bergman fan for life, with still much of his filmmography left to discover and enjoy.  He will be sorely missed.",1200268800,10,3984,4.660458452722063

564488,5,6303107338,"The Seventh Seal is a masterpiece of spare, visually immaculate film-making. On the rocks on the shore of Southern Sweden, a knight awakes, exhausted from the crusades, and encounters chess. An existential chess match results between the knight, and death, who is not so much the grim reaper as a sort of elderly clerical civil servant of mortality who patiently explains the rules of the game. If the knight wins, he escapes death, but the knight, Antonious Block, is not so much concerned with that as achieving meaning, valediction for his life as he is plagued with despair as to its value.

Made in the 1950s, a particularly icy period of the cold war, when nuclear stockpiles threatened ominous oblivion every bit as much as the Medieval plague victims that swarm through the Seventh Seal, the image of chess and death is a perfect one to capture the existentialist mood of the era. Block, played by Max von Syndow, with a superb long, pale handsome face of monastic despair and inscrutable philosophising, eventually transcends his calvary by sabotaging the chess match, and allowing Joff, a juggler to escape death's final calling along with his wife and child. By the end, his calm dedication to pursue meaning has prevailed, and death has not won its ultimate victory over value in life.",1197763200,,1297,4.8954545454545455
564489,5,6303107338,"This was the first Bergman film I saw way back in the last century--and it left a lasting impression. I'm one of those old fuddy duddies who actually likes the b&w format--and Bergman was a master of the craft from the beginning of his high profile career. I can't imagine THE SEVENTH SEAL in color. Sacrilege!

As the title suggests, the film is based on the Apocalypse & awash with biblical metaphor & imagery. It takes place at the height of the Bubonic Plague in Europe which also coincided with the Crusades era. People are seeing horrific death all around them and are frightened out of their wits. The Church takes advantage of this fear in order to bind people even more tightly to religion.

The main characters include a Knight returning after years of fighting in the Middle East; his sarcastic Squire; a thick headed lumberjack & his lascivious wife; a ham actor who also directs a motley three person traveling troup that includes a visionary, his beautiful wife & baby; a woman whose family have all died from the Black Death.

The Knight plays chess with Death who has been stalking him. He's not afraid of dying, but he is afraid of the emptiness of human existence & God's apparent refusal to intervene, or make himself known.

All the characters meet where the actor's are performing. In the middle of the outdoor ""show"" a group called The Flagellants make one of the most stunning entrances in theatre history--on stage or on film. Based on absolute historic recreation, The Flagellants were groups of people, encouraged by The Church, roamed the countryside whipping each other, wearing crowns of thorns, hauling crosses & in other ways abusing themselves. This is a central moment in Bergman's film and is unforgettable, and like a car wreck you can't keep your eyes off it. The scene emphasizes the masochistic hold of religion reinforced by superstition & ignorance. This idea extends to the persecution of a mentally challenged girl accused of witchcraft.

Bergman's vision--evidenced in this & his other films--is existential & naturalist, going beneath the facade, and reflecting an angry sort of love/hate dependency on Christianity. He is also influenced by expressionism & the work of his fellow Swede (and also deceased) August Strindberg. Ingmar Bergman was extremely popular in the 60's art film milieu, but his emphasis on the intellectual is probably not particularly appreciated today.

Bergman & Fellini (Tim Burton in this century) remain my all-time favorite directors.

Bergman reminds us that even our greatest achievements in life will not cheat Death, that superstition can create unspeakable evils, and that the enormous power wielded by the Church was sometimes tragically bad.  The film raises important questions regarding God and his existence, the meaning of life, and the emptiness that possibly awaits us after death.

The knight (Max von Sydow) and his squire (Gunnar Bjrnstrand) offer us two possible approaches to life: idealism versus hedonism.  Which approach we should adopt in our own lives is left to us to decide.",1196121600,,657,5.288461538461538

A world-weary knight in the 14th Century (Max von Sydow) persuades Death to engage in a chess match with him. Death risks nothing while he risks everything. This is obviously an unfair situation---but whoever said life was fair? How long can the knight keep the game going? Will he make it to old age? This dark comedy is highly entertaining.

I came across this poem: What is not will surely be/In the changed unchanging reign/Else the Actor on the Tree/Would loll at ease, miming pain/And counterfeit mortality. Edwin Muir, 1952. Could Bergman possibly have come across these lines --- in English? The subtitles ought to have been better translated: why did the translator substitute ""The Devil"" for ""Death"" in several cases? Misleading. Bergman tells us that the light suddenly falling on Raval, the corpse-robbing ex-monk who sent Block on the crusade ten years earlier, at the point when he dies in the forest, was a pure accident. A sort of miracle. Something I kept wondering was where Bergman found the theme for this allegory, or is it without precedent ? There is surely something of Durer's engraving ""Ritter, Tod und Teufel"" in it, as well as the delay of Death which is part of Goethe's ""Faust"", but the game of chess seems entirely Bergman's own. When I first saw it, about 50 years ago, I had a friend who was positively dumbstruck by the acting and simplicity of Nils Poppe. Poppe's career was remarkable. As a small child he was given away to a so-called ""angel-maker"" by his mother, in the full expectancy that he would be starved to death.

Bergman's symbolism fully blossoms here (his famous Death's dance, etc.) and the realism of the medieval scenes is visually striking and impressive. Also it's interesting to note, the characters of both the knight and the squire are of equal weight, sometimes acting nearly independently of one another instead of the squire being a supporting role, quite an unusual approach. The film is somewhat over-praised, probably because of being Bergman's first seriously acclaimed film in the US, but it certainly deserves most of the praise.",1190160000,,767,5.047244094488189

564497,5,6303107338,"The ""Seventh Seal"" is a masterpiece of cinema and film-making, because of the richness of the symbolism it contains as well as the impeccable acting of its actors.  The pathos of feeling exhibited by Max von Sydow and the other players is palpable, as is the depth of emotion, symbolism, and ultimate optimism that Bergman imbues every part of the film with, from the opening sequence, in which von Sydow plays chess with Death, until the last chess sequence (which von Sydow engages in to gain time for a young family to save itself), to the Dance of Death which concludes the film.

  To be sure, the ""Seventh Seal"" is early Bergman, and Bergman got better with each additional film.  So, although the ""Seventh Seal"" is well acted and overflows with rich symbolism, it doesn't have the absolutely searing, heart-wrenching pathos, and horror, of, let's say, ""Cries and Whispers.""

Synopsis: The sound of one long, sustained note from a gong drones through the opening credits announcing the journey is about to begin.  Human voices sing out in an ethereal dirge as a cloudy, threatening sky appears on the screen. A lone bird sails above the earth, wings spread wide and motionless as though all of existence has temporarily come to a standstill. There is silence in heaven.

The camera descends to the earth, to a rocky beach where Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) a disillusioned knight returning from the Crusades catches a brief moment of rest before continuing his journey home. As he rides through the stark, unforgiving Swedish countryside accompanied by his squire he becomes further disheartened by the circumstances surrounding him in 14th century Sweden. His homeland is ravished by the black plague and impending doom can be seen and felt at every turn. He is also aware of the fact that he is being stalked by Death (Bengt Ekerot) along the way. Unbeknown by those around him, he is actually playing a game of chess with this otherworldly spectre and remains alive only as long as the game continues.

However one ray of hope for a meaningful future appears, found in the guise of a diminutive, nave traveling performer. His love for life, his wife and child are the only thing that stands between the impending plague, Death and the meaninglessness of existence. Is there a reason for living, or is Death the only viable solution?

Critique: Ingmar Bergman's '58 film `The Seventh Seal' stands alone in a category of its own making. There was nothing before, nor will there be anything after that can match Bergman's existential intensity, ferocious imagery, symbolic content and thanks to the brilliant cinematography of Sven Nykvist, cinematic artistry.

Bergman's uncompromising vision of existence as translated to the movie screen deserves to be studied, dissected and discussed by intelligent, cutting edge filmmakers of the future. As for the viewing audience like you and I, `The Seventh Seal' belongs on every serious film collectors top ten list. I know it's on mine.

Throughout the film, the knight plays intermittent games of chess with death for his soul as well as knowledge about god. Filled with a great cast of characters that make the film funny, sad, beautiful, disturbing - ahh, I do love Bergman!

564561,4,6303107338,"Dark, beautiful, meaningful, exploring the most serious themes of faith and searching for God, ""The Seventh Seal"" is known as one of the landmark Bergman's movies. One of the film's inspirations was a painting that Bergman saw as a young boy and was transfixed by: ""There was everything that one's imagination could desire. Angels, saints, dragons, prophets, devils, humans. There were very frightening animals: serpents in paradise, Jonah's whale, the eagle of Revelation. All this was surrounded by heavenly, earthly and subterranean landscapes of strange yet familiar beauty. I remember Death playing chess with a Crusader, Death sawing at a tree to a branch of which clung a naked man with staring eyes, and across a gentle hill Death leading the final dance towards the dark lands"" (Bergman in Hart). The film follows the journey of a knight Antonius Block (Max Von Sydow) returning from Crusades through Sweden ravaged by plague. The knight has lost his faith in the blood and horrors of the battlefield, ""Faith is a torment. It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."" On his way home, he encountered people dying from starvation and disease, being burnt as witches as well as Mr. Death himself who challenged him to play a game of chess and the family of a happy juggler, his wife, and their infant son. This family is happy because they love each other. They represent the simple joys and hopes of ordinary life.

Everything about ""The Seventh Seal"" is extra-ordinary including acting. I especially liked Jns, Antonius Block's misogynist squire - the best performance in the movie by Gunnar Bjrnstrand. His quotes about love are hilarious:

""Love is the blackest of all plagues... if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in love, but you don't die of it."" ""Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection.""

I know the film's reputation and I enjoyed watching it but it did not click with me completely the way the others Bergman's films did (""Fanny and Alexander"", ""Persona"", ""Smiles of a Summer Night"") and I found myself bored few times. I keep thinking why? It seems to me that the movie is slightly overdone and overheated with its attacking images, abstractions and discursive dialog. I understand that it is a very serious film but while watching it, I could not help thinking how funny its images and dialog would look and sound in parodies. (Not as anything is wrong with that).

Weary on the beach, the Knight gets into a chess match with Death personified,  a game that will come back periodically throughout the movie.  In the meantime, they gather with traveling actors looking for love and respect while offering  needed respite during dreary times.  Whether sparring in game or conversation the dialogue is brimming with meaning about how life and death frame one another.  The resolution may not get the assent of the entire audience, but it will offer some solace and thoughtful resolve.

Watching 'The Seventh Seal' is fascinating, but I couldn't help thinking that in an age that often looks to 'The Left Behind' series for meaning about life and death, death seems so much more eminent and illuminating in Bergman's take of Medieval Times, whose real life participants had more right to think of Doomsday than we do.",1177804800,3,1207,4.935643564356436

He can see strange things, and although this is made slight of during the early portions of the film, it is later a pivotal catalyst to the entire movie's machinations.

Antonius and his band of vagabonds drift through Sweden as The Black Death sweeps across the nation. Death is very busy, thus giving Antonius more time to make it home to his wife (whom he hasn't seen in years).

But once home, Death catches up with Antonius, and he has to come to terms with the afterlife, whether he wants to or not. When Death knocks at the home of Antonius Block, everyone inside has to decide what awaits them on ""the other side"". Antonius prays for enlightenment about God (if there is one) and hopes to receive a sign (which never really comes).

In the end, his efforts at delaying Death help Jof, Mia and their infant child escape the unknown of the hereafter, thus giving a sense of meaning to Antonius' life.

It is noteworthy to mention that this movie has a seriously stilted screenplay. The actors' lines often seem strange and even out of place, making the viewer shrug in a mind-boggling way. Anybody who's seen an Ingmar Bergman film probably won't be bothered by this, but it is something to definitely prepare yourself for if you haven't.

Often heralded as one of Bergman's best films, it certainly was ...up to that point.

Being severely dated by today's film standards, the low budget is achingly present but not overly intrusive. The sets, make-up and acting are all well-played. But the biggest star is the lighting and camera angles. Careful use of light and shadow gives a terrible sense of foreboding with a minimal soundtrack. The perching of cameras in trees and on odd angles gives the film its own original look, honoring this film with several award wins (including the Cannes Film Festival's Special Jury Prize ...actually it was a tie that year but we won't go there).",1174003200,6,2746,4.708333333333333
564564,5,6303107338,"In this most famous of Bergman's films, a very young Max von Sydow plays a disillusioned knight returning from the Holy Land to find a country ravaged by the Black Death. Despite all he sees, he cannot believe that life is without meaning, and he searches for God in an increasingly chaotic world. Besides the obvious themes of life and death, one can look at this film from a religious point of view. The Church has stepped into the void created by the breakdown of civil society, and offers the people something to cling to in the chaos. In scenes of breathtaking cruelty, flagellants roam the countryside atoning for their sins; a young girl is burned as a witch; a seminarian steals a silver bracelet from a dead woman and then attempts to rape a young girl he catches watching nearby. The tortured knight watches all this with increasing horror, believing that God has deserted man but refusing to accept it. In the one scene of beauty and peace, the knight comes upon a family of traveling players, who offer him a simple welcome, and he sits on a hillside with them in the warm sun drinking fresh milk and eating wild strawbwerries (a Bergman favorite). One of the knight's realizations at the end is that salvation comes only through acts of mercy and kindness to fellow men, and by saving this family he redeems himself. Bergman presents us with a bleak view of the world, and a particularly bleak view of established religion, but offers hope at the end.

This isn't an entertaining film in any sense of the word, and it is hard to watch at times. People with no memory of black and white may find it odd to watch, but the bleakness is part of the story. This movie is an important part of film history, and timeless.",1172880000,4,1727,4.535256410256411

 Back from the crusades a Knight named Antonius (Max Von Sydow, in a dazzling performance) is questioning himself about Gods' existence. All he sees around is suffering, destruction, pain and degradation.

 The Inquisition and the Black Plague have devastated his homeland. Feeling among people is of desolation and loneliness.

 During his journey back home Antonius meets Death, that defies him for a chess game. Thats when begins one of the most memorable, unforgettable scenes  of the cinemas' story.

564566,5,6303107338,"This 1957 masterpiece launched Ingmar Bergman from a provincial writer-director into well-deserved international fame. His actors, particularly Max von Sydow, accompanied him on his journey of fame and choreographing thought-provoking films that challenge current notions of the meaning of life - what role does religion play (to terrorize its believers) - what is truth - and what lies beyond the grave.

Flawless cinematography, lighting, dappled faces are hallmarks of the Bergman landscape. He seems to grab the viewer by the collar and pull us onto the screen, forcing us to experience the horrors of medieval Europe, including the fruitless two-century long Crusades and the fear engendered by the Black Plague that swept through Europe.

Scapegoats, terror and cruelty were used by the Church to counteract any sort of threat or fear, whether to the Church's sacred word or the uncontrollable plague that killed off a third of Europe. People behaved like puppets, unlike our two heroes - the Knight and his Squire - who conclude we must create our own meaning and our own moral code.

Memorable scenes include von Sydow playing Chess with Death. He manages  to cheat death for a few hours, in which he accomplishes what he failed to do during his wholly unenlightened, morally degrading 10-year-battle in the Crusades: He saves a married couple and their child from certain death - and importantly - questions a naive young girl, a so-called witch, to discover if she knows the secrets of life, the Knight's ultimate crusade. The simple girl, brainwashed by immoral clergy, believes herself to be a witch who of necessity will burn - painlessly - for her sins. Von Sydow in an act of mercy gives her a potion that will erase the certain anguish of her death.

Von Sydow's temporary reprieve from death allows him to find - in only several hours - the life of meaning that failed him for 40 years. Excellent film commentary accompanying the DVD tells us that the famous penultimate scene of von Sydow and friends being led across the silhouetted landscape by the scythe-bearing Grim Reaper was just an afterthought by Bergman, just a happy or dreary accident, like life itself.

In ""The Seventh Seal,"" a medieval knight returns from the Crusades to challenge Death to a symbolic game of chess while he seeks the meaning of life... The scenes depicting the burning of a young witch, the masochism of a procession of flagellants, and the suffering of plague victims constitute an unforgettable visualization of the wretched condition of the human race...

564661,4,6303107338,"The Seventh Seal (Ingmar Bergman, 1957)

So I've finally seen The Seventh Seal, Ingmar Bergman's most famous film and, perhaps, one of the most famous films ever created. And I have to say, while I found it interesting, well-written, and occasionally amusing, I ended up thinking that my view of the film was somewhat tainted by the constant praise to which the film is subjected; in other words, that it didn't live up to a level of hype that, perhaps, no movie (with the possible exception, of course, of the immortal Night of the Lepus) could ever hope to.

The much-abbreviated version of the plot known to most-- that Antonius Block, a knight (Max von Sydow), returned from the Crusades, challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot, fresh from playing Hamlet) to a game of chess-- is hopelessly simplified. There is a great deal more to this film, and anyone expecting ninety-six minutes of chess playing is probably going to be quite confused. Block and his squire Jons (Bergman regular Gunnar Bjornstrand) have recently gotten back from a decade away, and Block is eager to return home to his wife Karin (Inga Landre, still alive and working as she nears the age of eighty). Death appears to Block, and the game of chess is proposed as a way for Block to buy time to get back home. The chess match acts almost as a framing piece; the journey's the thing here. Block and Jons, as fine a team as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, have learned to suffer one another over the past decade, like an old married couple; Jons, however, an avowed and vocal atheist, has noticed his lord's crisis of faith, and spends much of the film subtly manipulating Block to his way of thinking. Block, meanwhile, is seeing more than enough in a Swedish countryside ravished by the Black Plague to make him think that God may, in fact, be dead. The clergy to be found in the film are all bombastic buffoons, and a good number of them are outright evil; Block and Jons, in their own ways, are determined to do right by the few souls they encounter (in contrast to the clergy's scope, which is the entire country, or so it would seem). The two of them gather a small band together, all headed for Block's castle; the chess game unfolds piecemeal as the journey continues.

There is, certainly, much to be praised about this movie. The acting is good all around; von Sydow overplays a bit, but one gets the idea that that was stage direction straight from Bergman. The camerawork is well-done. The sound is a bit rough, but I'm more than willing to blame that on the transfer, or my particular copy of the disc. Where the film usually treads the line of greatness is in Bergman's understated script; Block's understatement and Death's civility are excellently counterpointed by Jons' brashness.

An enjoyable film, and an exceptionally good one. While it may be all that, you might still have to buy the bag of chips yourself. ****",1158710400,2,2897,4.65234375
564662,5,6303107338,"This movie starts with a war-weary knight who is returning home to Sweden from the Crusades in the 14th Centaury. He arrives back to his homeland to find it in the middle of the throes of the Black Plague. The pious knight played by Max von Sydow arrives home after years of fighting to find death.

The knight has many questions about God, death and the after life. And convinces Death to play him in a game of chess to determine if he would live or not. Of course we can tell his demeanor as the movie progresses that the knight is only trying to buy time in order to answers his questions.

Of course the knight finds no answers in his bleak search for the meaning of life.  Of course his chess game with Death postponed his death, but he did not find any answers and only brought death down on his friends and family. Though through an extra delaying tactic the knight tricks Death into letting an innocent couple escape his fate.

This movie would only work in black and white. Bergman expertly uses the effect of the juxtaposition of light and dark to affect our perception. The mood he creates and shares with us is just brilliant. It shows us that there is a fine line between life and death.

564665,5,6303107338,"It is a sinister situation when one plays cards with fate.  But that is just what happens in Ingmar Bergman's 1957 classic, The Seventh Seal.  In this film, the main character, a knight just back from the crusades, comes face to face with death, literally.  He challenges Death to a game of chess.  The time in between matches is filled with a plethora of characters that the knight and his man encounter on their journey home, and who end up traveling with them.  The film is the journey of many characters to their intended, or unintended, destinations.

  Bergman's film effortlessly brings the audience into the film.  The very beginning of the film sets up the aura of the entire film in a single shot.  Bergman gives the audience a high angle far shot of a turf tormented shore.  Because of the extremely high angle, this shot makes the viewer feel as if God is in heaven watching the chess game of life being played out below Him.  Hitchcock uses this same technique in The Birds.  Another shot that brings the viewer into the film is one when Death is first introduced.  Death stands with his long, black robe draped around his body.  The shot is filmed from the point of view of the knight and we watch as Death lifts up his right arm and walks toward the camera.  The long robe drapes over his arm and as he nears the camera the black material engulfs the shot until it completely overtakes the image.  The shot quickly transitions to a shot behind Death as he walks toward the knight, but for a brief moment, Bergman expresses a literal sense of being overcome by death.  The long, black sleeve of his robe becomes a shroud placed over the eyes of the audience.  Bergman brings the audience to the point of life which we, as well as the knight, are not yet ready to face.

  The acting in this movie has a genuine subtlety about it.  The knight's acting is so underplayed that he never expresses much emotion at all.  In the beginning of the film, when the knight and his man are riding their horses home, the servant is singing a comic song that the knight finds annoying.  Whether or not the character is annoyed or just playing at it, the actor's expressions remain the same.  He is lifeless even though he has gained a few more days to actually live.  Written all over his face, he is a man who is already dead in spirit and in soul.  That expressionless and unfeeling sense is something words alone are incapable of expressing, and the actor achieves this with out using any.

  Writing about the acting would be incomplete without saying something about Death.  Halfway through the film, Death asks the knight if the family he has met is coming into the woods with him and his other companions.  A slight and sinister smile plays on his face.  The smile lingers when he is questioned as to why he wants to know.  He says he has no reason, but the faint smile stays and he must look away from the knight.  Just as a human who has a wicked secret to keep, Death places his hand in front of  his mouth to conceal the smile that would betray him.  The subtlety of his actions are amazing, especially in light of  what the actor is trying to convey.  Death has a secret.  We, and the knight, figure out what that secret is by seeing simply the slightest smile on his lips.

  This movie demonstrates the power of simplicity.  Lighting plays, perhaps, the biggest role in this film.  Black bars contrasting with a stark white face, or the white face in a black confessional, tricked into confessing his tricks to Death himself.  And Death, with his ghostly white features and the long, skimming, black robe.  Death is such a gothic and wonderful character that I wish he was in it more.  I would happily forego watching the buffoon clown dance on a table like a frightened bear to sit and play chess with Death.",1151798400,2,3822,4.469565217391304

The fateful chest game and the events that transpire not only hold psychological significance for the individuals in the movie but philosophical importance as well on the meaning of life and the nature of morality.

The reason this film is scoring a 4.5 out of 5 stars is because I believe that plenty of other Bergman films have addressed the topics mentioned much more thoroughly, and much more interestingly. While film features a number of ""Bergman techniques"" such as the excellent use of black and white shadow-play to convey such things as mood, all-and-all the film is far less aesthetically pleasing than some of his other films. The ""content"" mentioned in ""The Seventh Seal"" is simply far less than in other Bergman pieces.

It should be noted that ""The Seventh Seal"" is one of Bergman's films in which the symbolism and the representational aspects of the story are much easier to grasp in comparison with some of his other works (namely his 1967 release ""Persona"" which is much richer in symbolism). This is neither a fault nor a positive aspect of the movie in itself; certainly this movie is a quality piece of work. Combined with a rather engaging story that everyone can find interesting, it's obvious then that ""The Seventh Seal"" would be more widely known than other Bergman pieces.

A terrific movie and yet my only complaint is that it seems like it was marketed more for mass appeal with the secondary goal of being a quality work of art than some of his other films. As I've seen only a small number of ""hardcore"" Bergman enthusiasts share this view. Go check it out this movie!

564748,5,6303107338,"The Seventh Seal is an inspiring film about a medieval knight returning from the crusades only to find himself in the middle of the black death.  Destined from the opening scene where he meets Death on the beach to fall victim to the plague, the knight begins a game of chess with Death, in an attempt to win his life be spared.  Throughout the film, he continues this game as he watches the despair around him, until he meets through his travels an entertaining young couple with a baby and decides to lose his game of chess and succumb to Death so to spare the young family from the plague.

 It is a haunting film, beautiful from the opening shot of a seagull flying through the dark clouds over the beach to the final scene of the couple watching the silhouetted knight and his companions dancing behind Death over the hills in the distance.

Many reviewers may tell you of the underlying themes of this film, such as the young family being like that of Joseph, Mary and the baby Jesus, and that by sparing them the plague comes to an end.  Or about the significance of the game of chess, relating to the game we all play with death over the course of our lives.  I learned all of this at art school when I was first introduced to Ingmar Bergman's classic and I am sure it is all worthy of thought.  But I must say that over and above any 'arty' themes of this film I simply love it because it sends a chill down my spine.  The imagery it demonstrates as a visual art and the conviction by which The Seventh Seal is brought to the screen stands alone.",1147392000,,1555,4.2979452054794525
564749,5,6303107338,"Something about the stark allegories of the Middle Ages seems to resonate within Ingmar Bergman.  He made two great movies based on medieval tales, The Virgin Spring and the Seventh Seal.

The story and look of the Seventh Seal were apparently inspired by the religious frescoes Bergman saw in Swedish churches as a boy.  After fighting for ten years in a Crusade to retake Jerusalem, a knight (Max Von Sydow) returns home to Sweden, which is being ravaged by the plague.  Suffering and terror swirl around the knight and his squire (the great Swedish actor Gunnar Bjornstrand) as they travel back to the knight's castle.  Death appears to the knight, who, to buy time, challenges Death to a game of chess.  Along the way, the knight and his squire encounter a troupe of actors, rescue a young woman from a depraved monk and pick up a blacksmith and his lubricious wife.  All of them make their way through the forest towards the knight's castle, with Death dogging their footsteps.

As they make their way through the carnage of the plague, Bergman's small troupe confronts Christianity's most bedeviling question: what sort of God allows such suffering to happen?  The pious knight can't accept that God has abandoned them, because if God doesn't care, the knight's life has been a lie.  The squire, grown cynical in the service of the Lord, adopts the agnostic position.  He sees religion as flummery set up to benefit the priestly class.  One of the actors, Jof, has visions of the beauty and terror that lay beneath surface life, but he's a sweet-tempered man who is not inclined to explore what he glimpses.  Although she doesn't speak, the young woman rescued by the squire seems to sense Death's presence and welcome it as a release from a life grown too hard to carry forward.

The Seventh Seal is filled with big, memorable images.  The knight playing chess with Death by the seashore is one of the most enduring images in world cinema.  Equally memorable is the procession of crazed flagellants seeking to do penance harsh enough to appease God's wrath.  There's also a young girl burned to death for being a witch whose eyes are filled with terror and confused defiance as the flames lick higher.

But these are counterbalanced by the warmth of smaller, sweeter moments.  In particular, the little family of actors, Jof and Mia (Bibi Andersson) and their baby son represent hope and faith in the fleeting glories of this world.  The knight shares a bowl of milk and strawberries with them on a sunny spring day and realizes that it's one of those small moments of contentment that loom large when a person has to sum up a life.  And the movie makes an almost Shakespearean use of humor.  The squire engages in drunken banter with a fresco painter.  There's even some slapstick farce when one of the actors seduces the blacksmith's wife.  Bergman continually shifts the point of view among the characters, as though to say, it's all life and it's all equally valid.

The knight decides that if his service for the Christian god may have been futile, then he must do at least one meaningful act for humanity before Death claims him.  He upends the chess board to give Jof and Mia a chance to slip away from Death.  After resetting the pieces, Death asks if this small delay of the inevitable was worth it.  The knight simply smiles.  He seems to have realized that small acts of kindness are equal to grand gestures of courage in the Great Accounting.

Bergman and cinematographer Gunnar Fischer do a great job of creating a believable medieval Sweden.  Lighting and composition, two strengths of Bergman's, are used to excellent effect in the dark, cramped buildings of the time, in the night forest, and at the edge of the sea.

The Seventh Seal is one of the great movies of world cinema.  Even so, it may not be Bergman's best movie about medieval Sweden and the bleak conundrums of Christianity.  The Virgin Spring feels less allegorical, which make the characters more emotionally involving, and the story more poignant.  Both are masterpieces that shouldn't be missed.",1145923200,10,4085,4.778887303851641

This is by no means a criticism of the film; like the original T. Zone episodes, THE SEVENTH SEAL has a sense of whimsy, images that stick with you, and an earnest passion-play quality that I found very enjoyable. Nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend it for people who can only judge films by the standards of their own time. Anyone who sticks primarily with contemporary movies might find this movie impenetrable and laughable.

One of the more blatantly philosophical films out there (which is a good thing in this case, by the way, don't think that I'm using the term ""blatant"" as a negative indicator), Ingred Bergman's The Seventh Seal basically is a contemplation on Death.  I'm sure you've read that already, on the back of the Criterion DVD box, on the synopsis written for it at any site where it's listed, in the many reviews, both critical and mundane, and everywhere that even mentions this movie.

So I'm not going to go so much into the focus of the characters on Death, as it were, because you know it all already, even if you haven't seen it.  Instead what I'll focus on is the idea of presenting Death or, roughly, imaging him.  One of the key things that sets the events in this movie off is that the knight asks Death to play chess and, when Death asks him how he knows he likes chess, the knight answers, ""I saw it in a painting.""

Throughout this movie are shown many different artists, philosophers, and people trying to present what Death is and looks like via different media such as painting, theatre, prayer, actions, and discussions, and yet the main memorable image of this film is precisely the distinctive image of Death himself, the man with the thin lips and large forhead who holds his arm out to envelop on the front cover of the Criterion DVD.  A film that invests its interest in Death needs a way of presenting him in a way that isn't completely stuck in the inspirations of other presentations, else focusing an entire work on Death becomes merely repetitious to what has all been said before.  Thus we have a very original and thus very compelling image of Death that becomes the inspiration instead of just being an amalgamation of other's ideas.

Thus this movie brilliantly shows Death personified and characterized without holding all the dialog towards Death as a person but Death as a force.  By showing that other people ""draw"" Death in various forms and different symbolic ways, the subjective viewpoint of who Death is is reinforced without having to be stated, which can be condescending.

Then we are so pleasantly allowed to sit back and watch the other characters all invest their energy into their ideas of Death, to mix them together and come up with a complete idea of how Death affects us profoundly and psychologically.

564753,5,6303107338,"`The Seventh Seal' is the quintessential early Ingmar Bergman movie. It is the one that is most commonly parodied by Woody Allen, Monty Python, and other humorists. It is the movie in which Bergman's focus on death, redemption, and sin is most powerfully expressed. Personally, I find the movie a lot more interesting and entertaining than `The Virgin Spring', but less interesting and entertaining than `The Magician', although that may have a lot to do with the fact that `The Magician' was the very first foreign language film I ever saw in a theatre.

`The Seventh Seal' is based on a phrase from the book of Revelations that itemizes the signs of the Second Coming of Christ. Like `The Virgin Spring', it is based in pre-Reformation Catholic Sweden with the lead character played by Max Von Sydow being a knight returning to his homeland from the Crusades in the 14th century with his squire. The land is infested with the plague, leading to heightened concern with death and the expiation of sins.

The film opens with said knight beginning a chess game with death. If the knight wins, he lives. If death wins, the knight dies. Oddly enough, the few statements about chess made by these two principles tells me that Bergman really didn't know that much about chess.

In the course of the movie, we encounter the two other main characters, Mary and Joseph with their baby son (Bergman is not exactly subtle with his allusions here). The two adults are part of a traveling troupe of entertainers who, among other things, seem to represent both innocence and true love, contrasting the lust, witchcraft, greed, and fear in all the other characters. I'm not keeping score, but I wager virtually all the deadly sins are here in one form or another.

Aside from a fear of death, the major topic on the knight's mind is not simply the belief in God, but the experience of god. For this, he quizzes the witch who is just about to be burnt at the stake.

All in all, I find Bergman's early movies to be more obvious, less human, and less entertaining than his major contemporaries such as Kurasawa and Fellini. I watch them because they are important and you can't understand the parodies of them without having seen them yourself.

If you see no other early Bergman movie, watch this one.",1136419200,4,2286,4.7025

The movie cuts through like a sword to the most frightening of possibilities: that beyond the reality of death there is no reality, nothing more to know.  Even Death is unknowing.  Few directors or authors have dared to tread into this territory.

They play a game of chess and while they play the knight (Max Von Sydow) tries to get some answers to the riddle of life. This search is tied into the title of the movie: ""And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was a silence in heaven about the space of a half hour."" (Rev. 8.1) This half hour will be the time the knight has to search for the truth.

Von Sydow is treated to scenes of carnage and debauchery - and to devastations (physical and spiritual) caused by the plague, which is ravishing the countryside. Finally, by relying on blind faith alone, the knight tricks Death at the chessboard long enough to let an innocent troupe of actors (a visionary, his sweet wife, and their child) escape from Death.

It's a typically bleak Bergmanesque search for some meaning in life; we are left with the question, ""Can man achieve salvation?"" The imagery is at times too dense and shadowy. The best part perhaps goes to the knight's squire, who is a cynical atheist, though not the hero of the film; he thinks the knight a fool for wasting 10 years questioning life during the Crusade and not living it (he is an existentialist).

564861,5,6303107338,"The symbolism, photographic technique, acting and profundity of the script make ""The Seventh Seal"" a genuine masterpiece of cinematic storytelling.

The film is not so much an apocalyptic tale about the war-weary medieval knight Antonius Block returning to his homeland from the Crusades, playing chess with Death (Bengt Ekerot) or meeting countrymen caught in the throes of the Black Plague as he journeys home. Nor is it necessarily an allusion to the nuclear Armageddon that mankind feared at the height of the Cold War when the film first appeared in 1957. Rather it is a young Ingmar Bergman wrestling with his own religious convictions, passions and demons, which we as a whole share with Bergman.

The pious knight (Max von Sydow) and the ever cynical, sarcastic squire (Gunnar Bjornstrand) are merely metaphorical vehicles used by Bergman to show his conflicting views on belief and uncertainty in God, which were shaped by his father who was a chaplain to the royal court in Sweden. Certainly Bergman is not alone in this quest. Who has not at one time pondered the same question? It is something we all address and resolve before death comes...before the ""Seventh Seal"" is opened to us.

The chess game with Death is Bergman's way of showing us that no matter how long we play or what decisions we make in life, we cannot cheat Death. Von Sydow's character disparately tries to do this, but the best he can do is stall for time while he performs good deeds unto others before his passing. On the one hand, we see the cunning of man in his quest to survive. On the other, we know he will not win his wager with Death. Moreover his delay and actions - unbeknownst to him - only invites Death to his circle of friends and family.

Along the way, the knight and squire met an artist, an inn keeper, a blacksmith and his lusty wife, an zealous and lecherous monk, a young woman accused of witchcraft and a traveling theatrical troupe. What appears to be a take on Chaucer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Canterbury-Tales-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140424385/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Canterbury Tales (Penguin Classics)</a>&nbsp;is Bergman's way of showing us the banter and earthiness of man as well as his capacity for cruelty. In one sense it is humanity in macro mirrored through these relately few characters. In another it is how we go about our daily affairs oblivious that Death stalks us too, just as he does those who follow Antonius Block.

It is no mere coincidence ""The Seventh Seal"" was shot in black and white. Bergman juxtaposes darkness and light with purpose. He affects our perception with light and shadow to create mood and character development. For instance, when lightness is apparent he suddenly allows with dramatic effect the darkness of Death to appear on the screen, as though reminding us that life and death are a hair's breadth apart, never knowing for certain when our time is near.

What seems at times a somber film, is anything but that. Near the end of the movie when the knock at the door of Antonius Block's home is heard and the door opened, we do not see who it is. We are left to assume it is Death or God. His guests and he look not so much in fear at what they see, but rather it is with awe, respect and acceptance of their fate when they state their names. In the end, Bergman leaves us with a vision that through man's trials and tribulations he passes on with dignity.

564862,5,6303107338,"In Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece, man- as portrayed by Max von Sydow in the character of the hapless knight Antonius Bloch- comes face-to-face with his own mortality- the universal fear of humankind, our inevitable demise that sooner or later reaches each and every one of us--except one family that is spared from the human fate.

 Shown always in the light of summer, the mythical family with cherub in tow is the example of that which must shine for the world to witness and follow for all eternity: The artist, his lovely wife (Bibi Andersson) and angelic baby that share the wild strawberries with the hapless knight are timeless creatures seemingly sent from the heavens to guide us all on our path and remind us that our efforts to remain human (rather than brutes like those in the bar who torment the artist) are not in vain.

Death is a stoic but even-tempered figure in the film- one who amicably agrees to a game of chess with a war-ravaged knight whose time has neared to a close- while waiting for his victory to take hold, an entity who knows his win is assured in one of the most darkly humorous and inspired scripts ever written.
The Seventh Seal is one of the finest works of art on film ever created, thanks not only to Bergman but to Gunnar Fischer his cinematographer.

I caught it first on Turner Classic Movies one night at 2 in the morning, not expecting it to hold my attention that late at night. But I was proved wrong, and what this was was a gripping, brooding, and powerful film.

Set in the medieval times after two men come back from the Crusades, a knight in confronted by Death himself on the beach shore. In order to save his life, he challenges Death to a game of chess. While playing from time to time, his squire and him travel the country on numerous tasks, meeting many characters, ranging from an angry smith to a humorous entertainer. Told in a real gloomy and dark manner, this film really interests me in Bergman's work.

This film is also very well written. Bergman's characterization is brilliant, a highly believably written work which only adds to the film itself.

Set in a Medieval Europe racked by the plague, each of the stark characters in the film shows a certain attitude in the face of Death which is a personified, stark reality revealed in the film. Some fight him, some run from him, some embrace him, some deny him. In the end, their attitudes toward Death reveals their ultimate attitude toward God and the meaning of their own lives. Very dark, but also comical in many places, not for the weak-hearted - we see pentinents flaggelating themselves as well as a witch burning which was haunting to be and absolutely horrifying to my wife.

Within the horrors of the film we see a simple family of mystery players who ultimately escape the plague and who seem to be a symbol of the good in suffering humanity as well as the Holy Family (the husband and wife are named Mary and Joseph). They are saved by the Knight who is literally shown playing chess with the Death character.

Unfortunately, too many ignorant modern viewers consider ""The Seventh Seal"" to be a relic of old,'60's art houses. They feel that they have ""moved past it"" and now have developed more sophisticated tastes. This attitude relegates this brilliant classic to university campuses, academic DVD collections and the memories of those who were fortunate enough to see it when it first came out.

The glowing images of this cinematic masterpiece alone should recommend it to any and all who have the sensibility to watch a real piece of artistic quality. Young Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand lead a cast of brilliant actors who bring this tale of metaphysical questioning to life in the midst of the devastation of the plague. Of course the image of the black-cloaked death playing chess with the Knight (Von Sydow) and the dance of death on the distant hillside are two of the most iconic (and parodied) images in popular culture.

Bergman's work has always been extremely psychological. He infuses his films with the coldness and dread that he feels permeates Scandinavian culture. This early work uses analogy, symbolism and ancient dramatic techniques to create a piece of cinema that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.

The vocations of the characters may seem antique, but one can easily sympathise with them because they represent archatypes and not stereotypes. The film is full of classic moments that reverberate long after they leave the screen and though many complain of Bergman's depressing overtones, it is the struggle to triumph, and not the victory itself that is celebrated here.

Eventually, we all lose to death, we all pass beyond the veil and nothing can prevent it. We all know this, though most of us bury it in our subconcious so that we may instead enjoy our lives without the spectre of death looming over us (much like a skull floating over a Sunday picnic).

Bergman, in this film forces us to confront our mortality, but why?

To answer the question we must ask ourselves what makes a commodity precious. The answer is resources. The more limited the resource, the more precious. This is EXACTLY what makes life precious- we only have a limited amount. Embrace the fact, and live your life based on that knowledge.

I was sadly mistaken.

This film SUCKS! Plain and simple.

It's slow, the story and plot uneven, the acting lacking in substance and character and the production sub-standard...even by 1950's standards.

Basically, it's a 2 hour snooze fest about a knight and his squire in their atheist search of God and the meaning of life.

The pivotal theme around which this premise revolves is the knights' playing a game of chess with the personified death. I guess this was intended to add a macabre air to the overall context, but comes off as more oddly comical than anything else.

Then there are the characters of Mary and Joseph and I suppose the baby Jesus whom, for some odd reason, was re-named Michael here....forgive my ignorance, but I didn't get any of that.

I didn't get this entire movie for that matter. It was neither thought provocking nor insightful nor entertaining.

(One of the finest public libraries in the country; in a city that has been going down the toilet for a long time now, alas.  But that is another subject...)  My expectations were none too high, considering that the film has become hackneyed enough to be satirized endlessly.  (""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" is an especially wicked parody; my own favorite remains the takeoff on the procession of flagellants in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"".)  Boy, was I ever wrong!  It is absolutely riveting, and at an infinite remove from verbosity, ponderousness, or pretentiousness.  The thin-as-a-bone, exhausted Knight, portrayed by Max von Sydow, is the very image of disillusion and world-weariness, while his rotund, Falstaffian squire avoids these conditions by deliberately drinking instead of thinking.  When he slaps at a biting flea, you are certain what must happen.  But you are still hooked.

The scene of the hapless, moaning ""witch"" being given over to the flames shows only her writhing silhouette against the background of crackling fire--yet it is more effectively chilling than any amount of cinematic gore that Hollywood could dream up.  It is this idiotic and futile scapegoating for the plague that really horrifies.  At the end, the 'danse macabre' on the bare and windswept hillside will remain in memory for years to come.

Most curious of all, when the film ended I felt unexpectedly, well, lighter--actually better than when I had come in.  This can only be ascribed to the cathartic effect that Aristotle found to be the hallmark of good drama.

Each of the characters has a depth and solidity that is unusual in modern cinema.  Bergman doesn't solve the riddle of god's silence - no big surprise there - but his wonderful method of taking the argument out of his own head and personifying each side of it in the characters of Block and Jons worked beautifully.  All that plus great cinematic beauty.  Keep in mind:  he made it in 35 days on a budget of $125,000 - tiny even in those days.

It's really irritating to see someone speak a word or two (in silence) before the line in audio enters - especially for me, since my first language is Swedish. I'm highly disappointed in this - 11th - DVD production of Criterion. On some of Tartan's presentations of Bergman's films there are out-of-sync dilemmas, too, but not through whole movies.
Another star is lost by Criterion's subtitles; they're very inaccurate when it comes to swearing and sarcasm. If a Swede says ""jvla(r)"", ""helvete"", ""satan"", or ""fan"" (which are the strongest curse-words), SOME of them HAVE to mean either ""f--k"", ""devil"", ""damn"", ""bloody"" or even ""AWFUL"", but nope...the subtitles here are as ""clean"" as the language in the bible.
If you want to see an incredibly PERFECT presentation of a Bergman film on Criterion, I suggest buying ""Wild Strawberries"", where the restoration, sound, SYNCHRONIZATION, subtitles, commentary, and 90-minute documentary are perfectly presented and displayed. I'm not a very proud owner of this edition of ""The Seventh Seal"".",1081382400,29,1913,4.889230769230769

564968,4,6303107338,"I approached this movie with few preconceived notions; I had heard of it but knew little in the way of reviews. I started it at 2 a.m. and it managed to hold my attention and keep me interested for the length of the film. It begins with Death approaching a knight (Max von Sydow) on his way home after 10 years warring in the distant Crusades. He strikes a bargain with Death, offering a game of chess. If the knight wins, he lives, loses and he dies. The movie is basically a vehicle for director Bergman's musings on the existence of God, wondering if there is only a great emptiness. Bergman does not mince around the philosophical points; he takes it straight to the viewer with frank dialogue. I was surprised by this boldness; I guess I am too used to the timid, politically correct inanities of current filmmakers. My favorite scene takes place in the confessional of a church the knight and his squire (played by Gunnar Bjornstrand who does a great job) stumble across. The knight wonders aloud to the priest on the emptiness of his faith and his wish to be rid of God. He states that God is simply a construct of man, who craves a way to deal with his fear of the void. The priest turns out to be Death, who has been stalking the Knight on his travels. This movie is not as morose as its plot suggests, there are plenty of scenes where laughter is the response. I think the movie has weathered time pretty well, even with its sometimes cheap looking costumes and set pieces (the walls of the knight's castle move in the wind and are clearly canvas). It was refreshing to watch a movie that actually had a deeper meaning other than being pretext for fart jokes or gratuitous violence. Incidentally, I was not surprised to see that those who panned this movie recommended ""Go"", ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Raw Deal"" instead...all pillars of modern cinematic excellence.",1078617600,18,1872,4.541420118343195

564970,5,6303107338,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS-
For those who've never seen this film: It's always best to see a film yourself before investing in its purchase, and that may go doubly so for this picture. The Seventh Seal is one of those ""deep"" foreign films which explores metaphysical concepts in a sometimes heavy-handed manner. However, the style will more likely reflect the sincerity of the director towards the material, rather than ignorance or immaturity- this is accomplished through consistency. There is bleakness, with humor oozing out of every pore. A black comedy, this is a film for those who can tolerate some high-falootin' ideas and speech with their entertainment. Perhaps you're so smart and mature that you'll already know and understand most of the questions posed by Bergman- but it's still never been done quite like this. Though it isn't everyone's cup of tea, it has earned it's right to at least a try by those who love film and certainly by those interested in foreign film.
For those who have seen this film: The DVD itself isn't the best one could imagine- there aren't any extra scenes, behind-the-scenes, director's commentary, whatever. However, it IS the best available and, if you care to wait another decade for a better version- well, the consumer knows best and we all have spending priorities to contend with. The commentary that comes with the disc is really bad, as some other reviewers noted- he really does speak the brutally obvious, but it can be kinda a fun for a one-time thing. The English dubbed version does indeed, as another reviewer commented, make the film appear more like some sort of western (or even samauri) movie. I kinda liked it. The film speaks for itself, so you already know whether or not you like it and wish to add it to your collection.
Finally, I'd like to comment on about how some reviews have been poo-pooing this movie for various reasons. Some folks seem to be judging the ideas in this movie poorly because, apparantly, it didn't totally change their lives or something. What did you expect? That Bergman had figured out the meaning of everything and this film is supposed to have the answer? It's simply another way of looking at things. Just because you think you know it all doesn't mean that other people are necessarily as ""culturally sophisticated"" as you, and haven't received an endless well of imagination and inspiration from this work. That is what this piece of film art has accomplished for countless people, and that is why it deserves 5 stars- even at the expense of other wonderful films.",1074643200,3,2567,4.849658314350798

565032,2,6303107338,"Time is not kind to this work. It is probably best enjoyed during your college years, when sophomoric profundity is most potent. Later, as an adult, you will watch this movie with smiles and with laughter. Affectionate amusement, to be sure, but the movie will disappoint. It starts with a couple of actors playing a fourteenth-century knight and his squire, asleep upon rocks on a beach. That's right: they are sleeping on rocks. The men appear uncomfortable, not surprisingly, and they do not seem to be asleep. In fact, they appear to be precisely what they are: a couple of actors, dressed in cheap costumes, pretending to be asleep. Unfortunately, this is only the first of many amateurish scenes. The acting throughout ""The Seventh Seal"" is at about the standard of a high-school play. There's even a juggler who cannot juggle. The editing is clunky. Bergman cannot direct action. The movie is alternately tedious and unintentionally funny. It is frequently campy and it is consistently cheesy. The script lacks plausibility and, oh, the striving for deep thoughts. Enjoy this film but, please, be honest: you are watching it through loyalty towards something you thought was wonderful when you were young. Yes, profundity can sometimes be found in an old black-and-white subtitled European movie. It will not be found in this one. Even Bergman, after a couple of beers, might admit that this early work should be ranked amongst his juvenilia.",1073347200,16,1449,5.041666666666667
565033,5,6303107338,"This film doesn't really answer a question but seems to search for answers. It seems to be asking about life, life after death, the meaning of life, and I am sure more. It seems very thoughtful in the way it was directed. It ponders as if it were a thought. Other times it seems light and sweet as with the couple Joesph and Mary. Another interesting image appears with these 2 people, who of course are married. It doesn't really seem to end with a conclusion but in fact more imagery, which feels unique and special. It doesn't really seem like a movie that you would see now at the theater, its like it is using the actors to act out thoughts or different parts of a thought. It is strange and eerie. There are dark spots, such as with the plague and death. There are some funny parts, from the actors mainly and Job, who is the squire, seems kinda of happy go lucky. All in all an experience, plan to think or just get caught in all the imagery without thinking, I guess either way it works!

565034,2,6303107338,"'The Seventh Seal' was mostly pointless and boring.  It has a great reputation in the film community, but there is nothing to get excited about.  I think the director was trying to make something profound, but it just ended up being lame.  The chess game death is playing with the guy throughout the movie is cheeesy.  The last scene looks pretty cool, but doesn't make any sense.  See it for curiosity.",1070582400,3,403,4.619718309859155
565035,5,6303107338,"Aside from being a profound meditation on mans place in the universe and all that, this movie is some kind of funny. No other movie has ever made such a macabre subject seem more hillarious. The scene where the troupe-director fakes his own suicide, only to climb up a tree which death soon cuts down, and others, have a sort of irony which you would be hard-pressed to find in literature, let alone movies. One of the sayings in my life that i've recited over and over again I got from The Seventh Seal: Whichever way you turn, your ass will always be behind you. The cinematography is truly lyrical, especially the opening scenes. At the end I felt a little jibbed because having seen Woody Allens parody of the Dance of Death I didn't get all the emotional power that scene had to offer. But it affected me nonetheless.
  You must appreciate Bergman's courage for undertaking this project. How many other directors would have the temerity to do make a movie about the futility of life so directly and so unreservedly? Of course, if anyone else tried it it probably would have turned out indulgent and juvenille.",1066521600,4,1114,4.621212121212121

565037,5,6303107338,"...
Firstly the theme. An engaging period story set in the plague-ridden Dark Ages, the story operates at many different levels...the story by itself is engaging but it's wider significance and universal appeal lies in its allegorical nature. And you don't need to be a student of movies to understand the metaphor of the movie..the point is gotten across clearly and without the subterfuge that art movie directors frequently resort to. Secondly the images. Images of sheer horror are woven all through the movie: the black birds hovering in the sky, the self-flaggelating sinners,  Death with the pale face and black shroud, the girl touched by the devil, and the dance of Death.....this horror is ""real"" and not contrived through special effects or through cliched horror set-pieces !
And transcending the imagery is the apocalyptic horror of the movie's message:"" the most terrifying thing is not death but the fact that in the end there may be no God....or that even if God exists He does not care to reveal himself."" There are multiple meanings of course..one can also extract some life-affirming symbolisms too and there lies the amporphous nature of the movie--no doubt one of it's greatest strengths. And lastly the polished performances( a little theatrical sometimes but suits in fine with the general ""unreal"" timbre of the movie) and the crisp evocative dialogue make this movie a must-see.
Not a feel-good movie-- for that please watch ""My big fat Greek wedding"" or anything else playing at your local Loews theatre. If on the other hand, you want  movies to make you  feel, think and debate then you have just found the right film !",1063065600,6,1647,4.9601449275362315
565038,4,6303107338,"I recently watched the Criterion edition release of this film, The Seventh Seal, with some friends.  Although the film's techniques -- innovative and startling in 1957 -- are somewhat cliche today, the film still packs a powerful message, which is that although we cannot know if God exists, it is still possible for us to perform meaningful acts in the time allotted to us.
The story focuses on the story of a Swedish knight, Antonius Block, returning to Sweden from the Crusades -- played by the ageless Max von Sydow.  The knight and his squire, Jons, are on the way home through a land ravaged by the Black Plague.  On a lonely beach, the knight encounters Death, played with admirable restraint, and a good dose of dry humor, by Bengt Ekerot.  Before Death claims Block's life, the knight challenges him to a game of chess -- if Block wins, he goes free; otherwise, when the game is over, Death will come for him.  In that Death is busy, the game is renewed throughout the movie.
The movie also focuses on a troupe of actors who are traveling along the same road as the knight.  Block knows that Death plans to come for the young actor and his family, and by prolonging his game with Death and thereby distracting him, he enables the young family to escape.
The movie, although obviously shot with a very small production budget and featuring a very minimalist approach (it could well be a stage play), is haunting -- one thinks about the movie's simple lessons for days afterward.
The film has often been parodied -- by Woody Allen in Love and Death, or in the recent ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" where Death is forced to play games such as Twister and Battleship with the film's heroes -- but it is still well worth watching.
The Criterion edition features both a Swedish and English-dubbed soundtrack, as well as a commentary track from a noted film critic.",1061769600,7,1867,4.625377643504532
565039,5,6303107338,"Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest films ever made, which may scare away some viewers.  The film is also a meditation on death and religion, which may also make some people hesitant to watch it.  I know I avoided it for some time, but the film is really pretty enjoyable.  If you consider yourself to be a true film buff, you really have to see this movie.
Max von Sydow, in the role that made him famous, stars as a disillusioned knight returning from the crusades in the 14th century.  He is travelling with his squire, and they meet a number of people along the way, including an acting troop and a blacksmith and his wife.  One of these visitors is Death, and the Knight tries to bargain for his life.  Death accepts the knight's offer of a game of chess.  As long as the game continues, the knight can live.
The movie is laden with symbolism, often of a religious nature, and filmed in stark black and white.  Although the movie is serious and cerebral in tone, there is also a surprising element of humor and lightness.  If you approach this film with an open mind, you will probably end up enjoying it, although it isn't for all audiences.  Highly recommended for discerning film fans.
EXTRAS: The DVD includes such extras as the original trailer and a written narrative of Bergman's career.  The best feature is the audiotrack recorded by film historian, Peter Cowie.

Bergman dares to ask the right questions at the wrong time, getting away with it. What he thought was a small film he did in summer with his friends, was actually, one of the finnest movie pieces ever made, briging this art-industry to a real state of mental challenge, the nature of God, the meaning of life you did ask in your childhood, Bergman puts it on the screen with an elegance long forgotten. Criterion does an exelente work with the DVD release, finally you can see it with all it's spledorous visuals, as one of the best black and white fotografies made in this firts 100 years of film making can be seen as it was saw in 1957.

It was the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. I have a couson who thinks this movie is interesting and good.  He must be crazy to think it's good.  Do not rent or buy this it's completly boring and not in the language of English.",1056326400,4,516,4.257731958762887
565113,5,6303107338,"THE SEVENTH SEAL is like the cinematic unfolding of a painting by Brueghel, whose canvasses recounted in massive detail a wide range of vagaries of the human condition, especially in their more macabre aspects.  This extraordinary film likewise spins out one remarkable vision after another, whether it is a warrior returning from the Crusades engaged in a chess match with Death, or a man receiving a vision of the Madonna walking with the infant Christ, or images of the plague, or an unforgettable procession of flagellants beating themselves to atone for the sins of the age.
Ingmar Bergman employs many of his usual great actors and actresses in this film.  Max von Sydow is riveting as the world-weary knight Antonius Block, who, tired and disillusioned as he is, nonetheless resists Death's advances.  Gunnar Bjrnstrand plays his companion, the squire Jns, who is an unwavering tower of strength in the midst of the death and chaos all around him.  Bengt Ekerot was not a Bergman regular, but he became the most famous and most successful personification of death in the history of film.  Absolutely no one who has seen this film can forget his eerie presence throughout the whole of the film.  When the film BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY was made, Death in that film was transparently copied directly from Bengt Ekerot's character.
The real stars of this film are the director and his cinematographer Gunnar Fischer.  Very, very few films ever made have as many famous and unforgettable shots as this one.  Many of the images even today have an almost overwhelming power, such any of a number of shots of Bengt Ekerot in his black garb and white face, beckoning with outstretched arm Antonius Block to come with him.  The final image in the film, with death leading his party along the crest of a hill is haunting and profoundly moving.  It is also a widely imitated shot.
One thing that makes this movie especially moving is the way Bergman accepts many of the precepts and beliefs of that time, and yet gives them an undeniably modern twist.  Antonius Block's crisis of belief, generated by the horrors he has witnessed both abroad and upon his return to Europe, reflects the existential crises many were feeling in the 1950s.  Yet, the film ends on an odd note of hope, as the itinerant entertainer and his family, who witness the Dance of Death from afar, survive and carry on.  Death has come and taken, but nonetheless, human life continues.",1053907200,3,2454,4.828162291169451
565114,5,6303107338,"The Seventh Seal is the kind of movie that Ayn Rand would have liked, because it is extremely efficient, like an inexorable clockwork. There is nothing superfluous in it : and at 95 minutes, Bergman could have added a half-hour and it would still look efficient. Every shot, every move, every word counts. Some shots are Biblical-like in setting, some others are nightmarish, but all are masterful.
What is The Seventh Seal about ? It is about a Swedish knight called Antonius Block, and his squire, returning to their country from the Crusades only to find it in the throes of the Black Plague. At the beginning of the movie, Death comes to claim Block's life, but the latter defies the grim reaper to a game of chess. While they play, Block and his squire encouter the grim consequences of the Black Plague, and confront the absence of God.
The Seventh Seal is definitively existentialist, much like Bergman was at that period of his life. Block is tarauded by doubt : he cannot accept Christianity without evidence, but on the other hand he cannot accept death without God. His squire, Jns, has no such scruples, and he asks him as they witness the fiery execution of a girl by priests : ""Who will take care of that child. God, the devil, the nothingness? The nothingness, perhaps?"".
Jns is a rough, perhaps callous man, and he finds his answers, like many other characters, in the enjoyment of the here and now. He is also an entertaining commentator on human nature, and seems more like the voice of Reason, where Block is the voice of Doubt.
What about Death ? Death is about as close we have to an atheistic counterpart to God - a terrifying, primal fear materialized into sentient agency. Unlike the Christian Big Brother, however, Death does not hold any grudge against us - as he says, he is ""unknowing"", and deaf to our complaints for the simple reason that he has a job to do. In The Seventh Seal, he is sinister, but not malicious.",1050624000,6,1944,4.605187319884727

In the true tradition of great European cinema, the technique is extremely understated and at no point does it ever overwhelm the content. (I mean, no fancy camera work, no earthshaking soundtrack either.) But hey, if you pride yourself as being a serious student of Cinema and well, if your mind is all the time pre-occupied about the larger issues of our existence, it doesn't get any better than this movie. Before you know it, it will invade your sytem and make you identify with its theme in a way that will take you by surprise. Larger issues of Life and Death, the belief in the Supreme Creator, the fascination with mortality, it's all there. The DVD quality is outstanding. Watch the sub-titled version if it's not much strain on your eyes. It's more true to the soul of the film. Part of the world's lack of patience with Cinema such as this is because we have forgotten what intelligent cinema is all about.

If you like intelligent films this is a must see. The acting is good, and direction is great.

I's watching this movie eagerly and came to the conclusion it's one of the most impressive and meaningful films I ever saw. Poeple might look at it in a different way but I'm convinced there is an answer ... A knight name Antonius Block (Max v. Sydow) returns from the battles of the Crusades. Sweden, his home, is frightened out by the plague and the shadow of death. Suddenly Antonius is not only tormented by his religious doubts but also by the personified ""Death"". He suggests a fair game of chess and wants to do good before leaving. During the chess journey he gets to meet a witch, a false priest, and find himself amongst countrymen who get to face the terror of the plague. I think the answer for truth is in the scene of the rural meal. I even think it's the hidden key to any question. Anyway an entertainer family, Mia, Jof, and Mikael show the knight the earthly bliss. Mia & Jof express hope, love, and the continued existence of life after death. They don't survive by chance of an act of divine mercy but because of the only importance in mankind what we call ""love"". Love means having a blessed life and joy and is the only thing that even escapes from nothingness and void.

565118,5,6303107338,"I came into this film with possibly unrealistic expectations.  I had heard so much about it, that I thought there was no way it could live up to the hype.
It did.
The Seventh Seal is an amazing movie.  It concerns a disillusioned Swedish knight (von Sydow) who returns from the Crusades to find his home being ravaged by the plague.  On the shore, he meets a masked robed figure who claims to be Death.  Rather than running in terror, the world-weary knight challenges him to a game of chess.  The game is played over several days, during which Bloc gets a look at how the townspeople are reacting in religious terror to the plague.
There are two parts of the film to be addressed.  Bergman's writing is anything but subtle.  It is the writing of a young artist just finding his voice.  He is trying to answer question life, God and morality.  The film asks how one can maintain faith when God is silent.  In this respect, the film is powerful in its bluntness.  Consider the masterful scene in which von Sydow confesses his questioning of faith to a man he thinks is a priest.  How he manages to find life, hope and possibly meaning amidst the rubble of his home in the family of entertainers.  The movie becomes a dark comedy in the late stages, including one of my favorite all-time movie lines as an actor begs for his life.
Bergman's directing is also excellent.  The aforementioned confession scence is remarkable.  The closing scene justifiably famous.  This is one of those films where the black and white medium is perfect.
This movie is well worth your time, even with he hefty price tag.",1027900800,17,1598,4.554385964912281

Everything is here . . . life, sex, greed, fear of death, murder, vengeance, . . . whatever is seriously considered by any man. . . nothing seems to be lacking.  There are no surprises.  Bergman outdid Hitchcock.  Bergman is no theologian, but demonstrates the human viewpoints of man towards God.  Unfortunately, but accurately, Bergman shows the attitude of man towards God and death and eternity through the eyes of a person living in the thirteenth century of northern Europe and under the complete domination of the Roman Catholic Church.  As I did a term paper in high school on the Black Death, back in 1954, I relived some of the terror of that period in human history.

565191,5,6303107338,"So full of symbolism that has been copied for decades since, Bergman's seminal ""Seventh Seal"" may strike new viewers as cliched, but when you realize that the movie is more than 40 years old and was an originator of many of these symbols, the importance of this film really comes to light.
A knight returning from the Crusades meets Death on the beach, who comes to claim him. The knight (played by Max Von Sydow) suggests a game of chess in order to buy some time. During the ensuing game, the knight embarks on a journey of death and reflection. The performances are amazing. The cinematography is brilliant and set a new standard in film.
Criterion, as always, pulled out all the stops in making this a keeper. There's an insightful commentary by Bergman expert Peter Cowie that is one of the most entertaining, useful commentaires I've heard on a DVD. It's informative and can be easily listened to while watching the film -- it doesn't distract at all. It's like having your own personal Bergman fan sitting right next to you. Some of the scenes require a lot of elaboration, which Cowie provides in abundance. There's also a restoration demonstration (this is probably the best DVD restoration of an old B&W movie, with the exception of ""Citizen Kane"") and a stills presentation of Bergman's career featuring narration by Cowie and some nice video clips.
A must for film fans.",1014163200,11,1382,4.7625

I suppose you can't blame anyone for older films like this, but what about modern flims?  I mean, the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon dubbing was really bad too, and it really can't be that hard to do right.  People should realize that quality of the original film really suffers when bad actors dub in for good ones.

Another easy recommendation to make is Bergman's book, 'Images - My Life in Film'.  The section on The Seventh Seal tells how the entire film was made in thirty-five days!  Here is a quote from the book:  'The Seventh Seal is one of the few films really close to my heart.....in this film I passionately cultivated my theme to the fullest...I placed my two opposing beliefs side by side, allowing each to state its case in its own way.  In this way, a virtual cease-fire could exist between my childhood piety and my newfound harsh rationalism...Also, I infused the characters of Jof and Mia with something that was very important to me: the concept of the holiness of the human being.  If you peel off the layers of various theologies, the holy always remains.'
*
The whole section in the book on The Seventh Seal is really interesting.  Carl Orff's 'Carmina Burana' is recounted as part of the inspiration for the film.  The screenplay was originally 'given the thumbs down from every imaginable hand' at Svensk Filmindustri.  The unexpected success of Smiles of a Summer Night gave Bergman the licence to film his script.  Money was nevertheless tight, and the previously mentioned 35 day schedule was only one day less than the maximum granted by the studio.  Only three scenes were shot outdoors, at Hovs hallar, and possibly the most famous of all, the Dance of Death almost never got shot at all - an impending storm saw the crew pack up, only for Bergman to spot a 'strange cloud' and have Gunnar Fischer replace his camera - the actors had gone, so 'a few grips and a couple of tourists danced in their place'.  Incredible!  One of the iconic images in cinema was 'improvised in only a few minutes'!
*
Bergman also knew fully the risk he was taking in his stylised depiction of Death.  'An amalgamation of a clown mask and a skull', as he puts it.  What a powerful image, chilling, and influential, most notably for me in David Lynch's 'Lost Highway'.  Indeed, there are many unforgettable images in The Seventh Seal, and, speaking for myself, repeated viewings only burn these more deeply.  Perhaps most frightening is the knight's 'confession' - if you haven't seen the film, I won't spoil it for you.
*
The juxtaposition of the gruesomely serious journey of the knight against the lighter world of the minstrels is, in some ways, reminiscent of Shakespeare, where a lower world and a higher world serve to counterpoint each other.  The structure of the film is especially satisfying and again stands repeated viewings much like a brilliant work of music stands and gains from repeated listening.
*
In the chapter in 'Images', Bergman relates his fear of death and how an overly heavy dose of anaesthetic prior to minor surgery proved revelatory - he suddenly understood  'that one could be tranformed from being to not-being'; as he goes on, 'That which had formerly been so enigmatic and frightening, namely, what might exist beyond this world, does not exist.  Everything is of this world.  Everything exists and happens inside of us, and we flow into and out of one another(..you can almost hear Woody Allen saying this to Diane Keaton...).  It's perfectly fine like that.'  Strangely, this quote is oddly akin to something from a surreal interview conducted on a television current affairs show some years ago with the richest man in Australia, Mr. Kerry Packer, shortly after a near-fatal heart attack (suffered while attending a horse race meeting) - on national television, actually on a television network which he himself owned, Mr. Packer confided that in his near-death experience he had found there to be 'nothing' on the other side.  I wonder what he thinks of Mr. Bergman's movie.
*
Bergman's films are serious, yes, but they are also pay respect to the formal rigors of drama.  He structures scenes with care, alert always to holding the interest of his audience.  It might be surprising to learn that the Hollywood script doctor and screenwriting guru, Robert McKee, holds Bergman as a model in this regard.  Another factor is the talented actors in his troupe, and their almost impossible physical beauty - Bergman was not insensible to this, as his private life attests, and also this quote taken from the preface to the screenplay of 'Face to Face' (Ingmar Bergman, The Marriage Scenarios - Aurum Press Limited): 'Nor in fact is there any harm in simply letting oneself be entertained for a couple of hours.  Good-looking and talented actors, who in a credible manner portray sad, dramatic, or amusing situations, are almost always entertaining, however painful the complications happen to be.'

As is probably already obvious, I love this film.  When I obtained a DVD player, this was one of the first three discs ordered.  In the personal Top Ten of all time?  For sure.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",1007769600,13,5267,4.793141592920354
565196,5,6303107338,"If you watched the Criterion release of ""The Seventh Seal"" with the English soundtrack on and the subtitles off, you probably think this movie is the Scandinavian equivalent of the spaghetti Western.  Good Lord, does the film suffer when you listen to ""Iron Chef""-quality actors (in a panoply of American accents and dialects) bring Bergman's text to something less than life.
In the original Swedish (with well-translated subtitles) it quickly becomes apparent that ""The Seventh Seal"" is something special.  Max Von Sydow is Antonius Block, the 14th century Crusader who survived a decade in the Holy Lands, only to be visited by Death the very day he returns to his native land.  One of the film's first images is the chess set and that's how Block staves off Death for one more day.  Isn't it surprising that, in the English-dubbed version, the officially licensed Star Trek: Next Generation chess set wasn't superimposed over the film?
""Seventh Seal"" is shot in rich black-and-white, with deceptively simple compositions.  Repeated viewings will show how many actors Bergman lines up in his shots, and how crowded the screen becomes with such pivotal images as skulls and fire.  The dialogue is direct and to the point (but never simple) and Von Sydow anchors the film in every way imaginable -- looks, speech, even the way he just stands till.  The movie appears so straightforward that you'd almost think ""I could do this myself!"" until you realize just how cleverly Bergman has aligned every element.
With its questions about God and life, its small cast, pastoral setting, and allegorical nature, this is not the kind of film you'd expect to see from Hollywood (especially beware films that have ""Seventh"" in the title and Demi Moore in the cast).  However for American audiences it brings to mind some of ""The Twilight Zone""'s finest hours.  Highly recommended is the annotated Bergman filmography (with photos and film clips).  Less recommended is the commentary track, leftover from 1987 and probably good of its kind back then, but for today's DVD-hungry audience probably one that talks down to the audience far too often.

The film isn't really about Man facing Death, but comparing Death, its 'reality' and real-life effects, with artists' attempts to represent it - through religion, allegory, music, theatre, art, song, the film itself; in effect encompass the unknowable (indeed, Block is the artist as God, creating the film from darkness with his opening words).  Even 'real' death is made into a spectacle or pageant,  as with the burning of the witch, or the procession of the plague victims.

A knight from the Christian crusades begins to question whether or not killing people for Christ is such a great idea. He is faced with his own death and plays a game of chess with Death to buy himself enough to time to find out if there is a God. In an astonishingly insightful and moving scene, the ""white knight"" played by Max von Sydow kneels in the Confessional begging the priest to tell him why God won't show himself. Why must he wonder that God exists. ""We make an image out of our fear and call that image, 'God.'""  Most movies, particularly in the modern era, have limited depth.

This is a remarkable piece of work. It will either awaken a thirst for answers or will it leave you shell-shocked. I was shell-shocked.
It seems like a simple allegory - a little fable to make you think. Seriously, how are you supposed to take a knight challenging Death to a chess match ? What are you to make of a squire who is afraid of death, but totally willing to put himself on the line for a woman he doesn't know ? What are you expected to take from a bad acting troupe whose kind-hearted is enough to make you cry ?
But that's just the beauty of this film. It makes an impact that you don't quite notice until it's too late.
One point : after years of consideration, I've come to all kinds of conclusions about this film. The strongest of these conclusions is this - if you see no other part of this film, see the scene with the traveling group of priests and devotees. It's brutal. Not just physically, but mentally. In the midst of death hysteria, the priest's sermon is without a doubt one of the greatest abuses of power you may ever see on film. The only sermon that has stuck with me as closely as this one is the one in James Joyce's ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"" about the concept of eternal damnation.

565369,5,6303107338,"A compelling contemplation of death and the nature of Man's existence, Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" is uncompromising, riveting drama that is every bit as striking conceptually as it is philosophically.  In the Fourteenth Century a knight, Antonius Block (Max von Sydow), and his squire, Jons (Gunnar Bjornstrand), have returned after ten years away at the Crusades to their native Sweden, and are beginning their journey home.  For Block, it is a pensive time; he is troubled by what he perceives as God's silence, and thirsts for knowledge and some meaning to his life, as well as a resolution of faith, which has deserted him.  Jons, meanwhile, is a study in jaded indifference, who believes in nothing beyond the present and whatever his senses and current circumstances dictate.  Shortly after their arrival on the coast of Sweden, Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for Block.  But Block strikes a bargain with him, challenging him to a game of chess, to be played as they continue on with their journey.  As long as Block prevails, they will go on; if he wins, he will be released.  And though Block knows what the outcome must inevitably be, he welcomes Death's acceptance of his challenge, for the game affords him perhaps enough time to fulfill his quest, while adding purpose to what promises to be an arduous trek through a land being ravaged by the Black Plague.  Von Sydow brings a commanding presence to the screen as Block, his very countenance bespeaking strength and poise.  His subtle, stoic approach to this enigmatic character is captivating, and lends a depth and dignity that makes Block truly memorable.  By contrast, Jons' strength seems born of his indifference; he takes things as they come, and is governed by a somewhat fatalistic philosophy.  Bjornstrand, a gifted, eloquent actor (and veteran of numerous Bergman films), invests an earthy, gritty quality to Jons that plays effectively opposite von Sydow's more ethereal portrayal of Block.  It is significant that in the closing scene the final speech, in the presence of Death, is accorded to Jons; for it elevates the character to a station equal to, if not surpassing, that of the protagonist, Block.  The supporting cast includes Nils Poppe (Jof), Bibi Andersson (Mia), Inga Gill (Lisa), Gunnel Lindblom (Girl), Anders Ek (The Monk), Ake Fridell (Plog) and Erik Strandmark (Skat).  Written and directed by Bergman, ""The Seventh Seal"" is a thought provoking, earnest meditation on faith and mortality that is filled with stunning metaphoric and visual images that will forever be indelibly inscribed in your memory.  One scene in particular, in which the players link hands and, silhouetted against a twilight sky are led by Death in a dance across the crest of a distant hill, is breathtaking in it's simplicity.  It stands (as does this entire film) as an example of why Ingmar Bergman is one of the greatest directors in the history of the cinema.",973296000,9,2934,5.018556701030928

565374,5,6303107338,"Many viewers mistake ""The Seventh Seal"" for an existentialist treatise on such issues as the death of God and the isolation of man, though this is  hardly the case. ""The Seventh Seal"" contains a powerful, existential line  of questioning, but it is hardly a film about Existentialism-in fact, it is  quite the reverse. Although God is not revealed in this film, His presence  is. Although the hero of this film remains isolated with silent courage, he  is never completely alone and his actions are far from meaningless.
""The  Seventh Seal"" is really more of a play than a film, and it is one that does  not treat religion kindly. Even people who have never seen ""The Seventh  Seal"" are probably familiar with its dramatic opening scene. The knight,  Antonius Block and his squire Jans have returned to Sweden after more than  a decade of participating in the crusades and are sleeping on rock covered  beach. When the knight awakes and starts to pray, Death appears on the  beach. The knight's time has come but rather than submitting to Death, he  challenges Him to a game of chess. They agree that as long as the game  proceeds, the Knight remains alive. If he wins, he survives, and if he  loses, Death takes him.
The knight's battle with death remains a silent  one. He never tells his squire or any of the people they meet on their way  to his castle. At one point, the knight attempts to reveal his situation  (including his winning chess strategy) to a priest during confession.  Unfortunately, Death has disguised himself as a priest and learns of the  Knight's strategy. During his confession, the knight asks ""why can't I kill  God within me?"" Christianity fails to provide the knight with any sense of  God, but the knight cannot rid himself of his sense of God. This is similar  to the statement made by a character in another Bergman film called ""The  Virgin Spring"". In this film, another knight (also played by Max Von Sidow)  arrives at the location where his daughter was murdered and shouts, ""God, I  do not understand your ways, but you are all that I know!""
In both of  these films, Bergman introduces a dualistic interpretation of God. There is  the human perception of God that manifests itself in art and religion, and  there is the actual existence of God which remains a mystery in our  lifetime.
As the knight and his squire journey back to his castle they  encounter corpses from the Black Plague, a cynical former priest and a  witch being burned at the stake. They also encounter a troop of actors, a  cuckold, and his wife who all join the knight's party. When the knight  finally loses the chess game, Death tells him that he will come for him and  his friends the next day. The knight frantically leads his party through a  thunderstorm but leaves the actor and his family behind.
When the  bedraggled party reaches the knight's castle that evening, they are met by  the knight's wife and begin reading the Bible. As they read Revelations out  loud, there is a powerful knock on the door. The knight's wife opens the  door and stares up at Death. One by one the people in the castle introduce  themselves to Death with solemn respect. This time the audience does not  see Death, but they can tell from the expressions of the Knight's party  that He is much larger than he was in his previous encounters with the  knight.
The contrast between the humorous personification of Death who  played chess with the Knight and the silent, invisible, larger than life  version of Him is a critical point of the film. At the end of the film,  Death is a manifestation of God that defies perception or description. When  the knight's party submit to him, they are calm and reverential but do not  invoke religion.
God is definitely present in this movie, but He is  never explained or depicted to us. Like many of Bergman's other films this  one does not attempt to refute or uphold the existence of God but instead  examines the human perception of God. Throughout the play, God is  inaccessible when people try to reach Him through social or religious  mechanisms. The only people who perceive God are those who are about to die  in the Knight's castle, and the actor whom the knight abandoned in the  storm. The following morning, the actor looks out into the fields and sees  Death leading the knight and his party away. When he describes this to his  wife she laughs and says, ""you and your visions and dreams.""
Similarly,  while ""The Seventh Seal"" spends a good deal of time examining human fears  and struggles, it is hardly an existential film.  Yes, almost every  reference to institutionalized religion in this film is fake or tarnished.  The knight and his squire are returning from the crusades-a monumental  Christian failure.  Every priest they encounter is a phony, a sellout, or a  murderer. When the knight reaches out to the church in a moment of  confession, he is immediately betrayed. Despite the emptiness of religion  in this film, the characters are hardly operating in a spiritual  vacuum.
""The Seventh Seal"" ends with a tenuous but palpable spiritual  affirmation. In the end, the Knight achieves a miracle by distracting Death  from taking the actor and his family with the rest of the knight's party.  The actor also achieves something of a miracle by perceiving and explaining  how Death leads the knight's party away.
Bergman is too brilliant and too  subtle an artist to examine such superficial questions as whether or not  God exists or human kind is alone in the world. Instead, Bergman examines  the human condition not so much in a spiritual vacuum but from the  perspective that we cannot know the Divine while we are alive. But in that  time, we can experience manifestations of the Divine, some of which take  place through our own decisions and actions. This is why even after  religion has failed him, the knight still cannot ""kill God"" within  himself.

That  being said, The Seventh Seal is an intellectual masterpiece. The first  several times I viewed this film, I took it as a statement from Bergman  that there was no God and that life is pain and suffering, themes that he  dealt with throughout his career.  However, upon the last viewing,  something occured to me.  The film is much more complex than simply  ""God is dead.""  There is a strong conflict between faith and  intellect.  The agnostic Knight, the hero of the story, and infact everyone  except the Family (the acrobat, the actress and their son) all meet with  Death in the end.  The Acrobat (forgive me for not remembering names), with  his blind faith (manifested, I feel, through his vision of the Virgin Mary  and with a baby Christ) is the only one who escapes.  Bergman seems to  suggest that faith is a necessary part of survivial, an idea which seems to  pop up in his other films, specifically in Through a Glass Darkly.

This movie is more than a classic, it's really a landmark  in the history of the seventh art, it's simply one of the best movies ever  produced.
Fortunately Criterion has given to THE SEVENTH SEAL the  attention this movie deserves and is offering now the definitive version of  this masterpiece. At least, silences wanted by Ingmar Bergman at peculiar  moments of the film are REALLY silences. When Death appears, you can see  the leaves of the trees trembling and the waves of the sea dying on the  shore but without noise, so the first words spoken by the apparition give  you the chill.
In THE SEVENTH SEAL, Ingmar Bergman raises important  questions, in fact the sole really important questions that matter for  humans : is there something after death and if not, why are we here ? Just  follow Max Von Sydow, Bibi Andersson and their companions in this terrible  quest.

565459,5,6303107338,"Kudos to Criterion for making this film available on DVD. this edition is even clearer than the LD version (which they've already retouched). the commentary is excellent and makes it even more accessible to viewers.  although, i really have to be in the mood to watch this film : ) whenever i  DO watch it, i've enjoyed it. the incredible surreal imagery validates  Bergman's mastery in framing, capturing and conveying his scenes.
7th  Seal deals with a war-worned crusader making his long journal back home.  the delaying tactic he employs is to engage Death, no stranger to the  knight during the crusades and the plague, in a game of chess. as long as  the game continues, the knight is allowed to live and he moves closer to  home... Death is amused but not only is he a master player, he also cheats.  i really enjoyed the scene at the confessional. there's quite a bit of dark  humor in this usually linked by the knight's very down to earth  squire.
interestingly, Bergman shows the knight's last desperate  diversionary tactic failing on one level where succeeding in another -- the  gambit for his fellow travelers' passage mirrors the chess game  well.
certainly not an easy film to watch often but simply an injustice  if the Seventh Seal is missing from your treasured movie collection.",950832000,5,1299,4.788288288288288

I have probably seen this film more than any other single one -  certainly over a dozen times over the years.  Some of the Amazon customer  reviewers felt the film moved too slowly, or was not stimulating enough in  black and white.  For such moviegoers this film is definitely not for you.  However, for those who enjoy films that speak on many different levels and  provoke thoughts that linger with the viewer, this is a masterpiece.
The  action takes place in Europe after the crusades.  A knight, Antonius Bloch,  is returning to his home in Denmark.  He is accompanied by his squire.  Block is an idealist who joined the crusades because he wanted to do  something significant in his life.  However the crusades turned out to be  completely disillusioning.  On his journey he notes that the plague is  sweeping across the land.  Superstition reigns, along with a severe version  of religion.  His squire is not as bothered by what he has seen, having  been much more cynical all along.  Still, the squire has a strong sense of  justice that is demonstrated when he saves a girl from an attack.
Along  the way a number of people join with the knight for protection.  These  include a troupe of actors, a blacksmith and his faithless wife, and the  woman the squire rescued.  Death is lurking, and confronts the knight,  informing him that his time has expired.  The knight protests that he  cannot die before having accomplished something significant.  Death says,  ""They all say that,"" but the knight insists, and successfully challenges  Death to a chess match.  This gives the knight additional time to make his  life worthwhile.
The knight has tried to accomplish the BIG act based on  a profound sense of life and of God.  The juggler and his wife have a much  simpler idea of life, God, and goodness.  As Death is on the verge of  winning the chess match and taking everyone in the knight's party, the  juggler wakes his wife and child to flee.  The knight recognizes that the  juggler has seen Death, and upsets the chessboard to distract his opponent.  This gives the juggler just enough time to escape.  Death asks the knight  whether the delay was worth it, and the knight gives an enigmatic smile.  He has accomplished his worthy act, not by saving the world, but by saving  just one family.
Everything about this fine film is outstanding, from the  acting to the cinematography to the direction.  The Criterion transfer  restores the film to the best possible condition.  The commentary tracks  are very informative.  Many movies have parodied The Seventh Seal,  including Woody Allen and Bill and Ted's Adventure series.

565461,5,6303107338,"Bergman is not a happy man.  He spent much of his childhood plotting ways to kill his brother.  But his art, though often heavy and emotionally onerous, is to me beyond reproach.
His reputation is well served in  this film about a knight searhing for a meaningful reference point in  plague-torn Europe.  There is death everywhere. Death and fear--because of  the plague, the bloody Crusades, the scare tactics of a gothic,  intimidating, and imposing Church.  To add to this, Death, the entity, is  chasing him.  Of course this is going to be a movie that speaks to the  larger issues of life--the meaning of existence, whether or not God exists,  what happens when we die.
But the film only asks, and never answers.  The closest we get to an answer is in the form of the little acting  troupe/family of Jof, Maria, and their baby, Michael.  Jof is an actor who  has visions of the Virgin Mary, and continuously strives to do THE  impossible trick--suspend a ball in air.  Maria is his wife, chaste,  blonde, and matronly.  Michael is a very active, happy toddler who is  nurtured by his parents.  This family is pure, non-intellectual, primitive,  and has an archaic, unsophisticated optimism towards life.  It's almost as  if Bergman is saying that in order to have faith in something beyond the  physical realm you must be LIKE THESE PEOPLE.
But in the end of it all,  only the naive, ingenuous, and primitive are able to escape the  unmistakable hand of Death.  And in the end, we see that even Death dances,  and maybe the end of life ain't so bad for the slightly spoiled.",950659200,5,1579,4.656934306569343

Just like the knight(Sydow)has turned away from GOD,and  now after seeing the hell of war wants to know what is life really all  about. That question is unanswerable.

When he  arrives he sees that maybe things were better when he was fighting in the  war! He's not even sure if his wife was killed by the plague! Soon he meets  DEATH. Death informs him his time is up! And you thought getting sent for  jury duty was bad..huh! The knight is not willing to follow death..who  would be? He suggest that they play a game of chess. The reason this is  brought upon is because legend has it that Death was a master player. If  the knight wins...he may go free...but and there's always a but...if he  shall lose he must go with death. The knight now must find answers to  these's unsolveable questions...Is there a GOD? What is our purpose on  earth? The knight talks about how he wants to believe in GOD..but can't.  Only if GOD would show himself and offer his hand to him,or speak to him,he  would be satisfied.

No, Ingmar Bergmann, whom I believe to be one the greatest film creators of all times, did not make ""The Seventh Seal ""to ""entertain""  us.  It happened years ago when I was introduced to Bergman by my  girlfriend while we were dating.  We were together when we watched Wild  Strawberries, The Seventh Seal, The Virgin Spring, The Magician, The  Silence, and a few others of Bergmann's earlier black and white  films.
""The Seventh Seal"" is compeling evidence of how much an artist can  communicate with image, black and white image !  Universal !  The essence  of all time philosophical questions and pursuits:  the quest to understand  the meaning of life, to find and join with the ultimate essence, its  creator, the one responsible for giving and taking away.  The knight who  escaped death while fighting the crusades may very well represent our own  consciousness.  Even as our daily pursuits are more ""down-to-earth"" and  deal with ""the tangible"",. aware or not, we ask questions, we seek answers,  we feel compelled to want to know what life is, and, as it happens with so  many things, we start to appreciate them even more so when we are about to  lose them.  We value life when we face death.
It is a film rich in  symbols, with beautiful and compeling visuals.  Each and every image means  something.  Each and every word said means something.  Visually, The  Virgin Spring may be even more impressive, but The Seventh Seal truly is a  ""black and white"" masterpiece.  Yes, color can add to the artistic  expression - consider Kurosawa's Dodes `ka-den and Kagemusha, Antonioni's  Blow-Up, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and The Duelists, Tarkowski's Solaris  and The Sacrifice. with its stunning cinematography by famous Sven Nykvist  who was behind the camera when Bergman shot The Seventh Seal.  Of course,  it is enticing to know what Bergmann might have done had color been  available to him in 1956 when he made the film., but does The Seventh Seal  really ""lacks"" color ?
Life as a Game of Chess - a metaphor !  White  (life) against Black (death - the very negation of life).  Who won ?  A  child is born - life triumphs over death, as the film ends on a cheerful  note:  life (God's investment in Humanity) is everlasting - as one dies,  another one is born !

565509,5,6303107338,"There is no god, there is only man.
THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957) remains to this day one of the most profound and enigmatic explorations through man's eternal yearning for the meaning of life. Directed by acclaimed Swedish  director Ingmar Bergman, THE SEVENTH SEAL tells the story of Antonius Block  (Max von Sydow) a knight on his way back to Sweden after having spent 10  years fighting in the crusades.
I should make clear that this is only the  initial setting of the story, and that in fact the film is populated by a  flurry of wonderful characters. Indeed it seems that throughout the film we  meet all sorts of beings: Jns (Gunnar Bjrnstrand) the just and valiant  squire, Jof (Nils Poppe) and Mia (Bibi Andersson) who perfectly capture the  innocence and purity of love, a dying young witch (Maud Hansson) who kept  remainding me of Joan of Arc, a young girl who follows the squire (Gunnel  Lindblom) and who barely says a word throughout the movie, but whose eyes  are so alive and expressive; and perhaps the most daunting and chilling  performance of all, Death itself (Bengt Ekerot).
It is said that war can  break a man and drive him into madness and solitude. In the SEVENTH SEAL  Antonius seems to have lost all his faith and desperately seeks to find the  answer to the one question that haunts him the most: does God exist? Death  meets Antonious at the start, Antonious realizes that perhaps the end is  near and in an effort to redeem himself he challenges Death to a game of  chess. The end result is one the most fulfilling (and awkwardly bizarre)  conclusions I have seen in a movie.
The Criterion Collection DVD is  simply by far the best option for anyone interested in the movie. With a  wonderful and insightful commentary by film historian Peter Cowie and a  well presented filmography on Bergman, the DVD edition can satisfy even the  most rabid Bergman fan, or prove an excellent starting point for those who  are not familiar with Bergman's work (like myself).
