5401510,5,B00A92MC64,"This is one of my favorite shows ever on TV It has something for everyone Each character has an interesting story that
anyone with a family can relate to. the show is passionate and funny  The price is high but the show is very good.",1365120000,3,233,4.177777777777778
5401511,3,B00A92MC64,"We like the programs; it's interesting to see the cultural changes since this show was on TV.  Our major complaint is with the quality of the DVD's themselves.  One of the DVD's was defective and garbled.  Amazon replaced the set.  The replacement set's DVD holders were broken when we received the new set.  Also, there is no literature or program guide provided in the cases.  The packages say that they were made by Warner Bros., but the quality of a couple of the DVD's recordings was certainly lacking.",1364342400,9,507,4.704545454545454
5401512,5,B00A92MC64,"A really good family show, 30+ years after it was originally shown, it surpasses what is considered a family show today. Hopefully Warner Bros. will put future seasons out in a total package instead of the part 1, part 2 crap and at a more reasonable price. At least Amazon was smart enough to bundle it so you saved a little on the price.",1360454400,4,339,4.3125
5401513,5,B00A92MC64,"This was one of the favorites for my ex-wife and me when we were together. And it's nice to be able to watch these shows and get transported in time to a better time in my own life. It was life in the late 70's and a far cry from Leave it to Beaver, or Dennis The Menace.
It was a good show and I highly recommend it for anyone who just likes better television. I really do appreciate the people who make it possible for anyone to be able to watch these shows again and have it in our own video libraries.",1360368000,6,505,3.912621359223301
5401514,5,B00A92MC64,Absolutely love season 2 if you love eight is enough make sure you get a copy. Am really looking forward to season 3 coming out and all the rest. Thanks,1360108800,2,152,4.1
5401515,5,B00A92MC64,I watched this the entire series growing up and it's one of the best shows besides happy days. this show has morals that don't really exsist nowadays and that's another thing that i love about this show. Maybe the kids now will show that they actually have some and respect for other's.  P.S. that kid adam rich plays nickolas is a year or two older than i.,1359590400,3,357,4.3283582089552235
5401516,1,B00A92MC64,"This ""Part 1 and Part 2 Complete Pack"" is stated to run for 960 minutes.  But the 2 parts separately run for 691 minutes and 600 minutes respectively.  So since 960 is not equal to 1291, what happened to the other 331 minutes?  Why are these stupid ganmes being played on the loyal fans by the DVD release people?  Not pleased or impressed.",1356998400,12,340,4.349206349206349
5401519,5,B00A92MC64,Very satisfied with the DVD set.,1416787200,,32,4.5
5401520,4,B00A92MC64,Came on time but there was on bad spot in on episode.  Would recommend this to anyone who liked '70s TV.,1402790400,,104,3.9523809523809526
5401521,3,B00A92MC64,"Absolutely love Eight is Enough and was thrilled to finally find it on DVD but so far only Season 1 is available in Canada.  After waiting a long time for more shows I finally gave up and ordered Season 2 from Amazon.com.  The $60 price tag I was willing to spend but be warned that that exceeds the limit for out of country products.  I paid $20 for shipping and then was dinged another $20 for duty and taxes so $100 total.  I don't mind that once but now that all five seasons are out on DVD it's frustrating to think I would have to spend that on each of the other seasons.  Also, as it is a MOD format it will only play on our DVD player so no watching the Bradfords on my laptop while my husband is watching football and hockey on TV.  All in all a disappointment Warner Brothers.  Love the show but hate the difficulty poor Canadian fans have getting copies of this especially with all the other bad TV shows that are out there on DVD.  And am disappointed with the MOD quality. 5 stars for the show, 1 star for Warner Brothers, for an average of 3 stars.",1394582400,2,1062,4.146341463414634
5401522,4,B00A92MC64,This is a great find of one of my favorite television shows as a child.  The only problem is the price.  I would have purchased more seasons at once it they were not so expensive.  The quality of the DVD's and the delivery was first rate.,1391990400,3,238,4.130434782608695
5401523,1,B00A92MC64,$42.00 for a DVD-R? No thanks. I've seen enough complaints from buyers on this already. I'll wait for a REAL release,1388275200,5,116,4.571428571428571

5401525,2,B00A92MC64,"I love the show and wanted to have it all in my collection.  However, the Second Season Part I, comprised of 4 discs, contained only discs 1, 2, and 4.  Getting this corrected is difficult! I would appreciate being able to get the missing disc sent to me, without having to send back the whole order.",1380672000,,300,4.339285714285714

Both cases were totally broken inside and out on both (the DVD's flop all over and fall out)",1367884800,,138,4.148148148148148
5401528,3,B00A92MC64,"Love the series, but don't know why it cost so much compared to so many other tv programs on DVD?  Secondly, why part 1 and 2?  Who would want to watch the first half of a season?",1366156800,15,179,3.810810810810811

However, after purchasing EIE Season 3 and then Season 2 Pts 1 and 2....ALL had defective discs....Disgusted....WAY overpriced anyhow...but I loved the show, so I sacrificed.  After opening and trying to play...ENTIRE episodes Unwatchable due to large scratches....Couldn't be me, as I literally just opened the package....Want my $$ back...",1509667200,,360,5.7924528301886795
8548631,4,B00A92MC64,"Got it for my granddaughter for her birthday, because she wanted to watch (her mother had watched it and said her daughter wanted to watch the shows) but it has more mature subjects than I remember.  But her mother said she will watch them with her as sort of a buffer.",1499212800,,269,4.2745098039215685
8548632,1,B00A92MC64,"I absolutely love this series but felt that Season Two/Part Two was poorly written. The cast was too talented for the lame material provided to them. The episode where Abby neglected the feelings of Susan and husband, Tom, while galavanting off with Susan's bf (whom she generously offered to help with a statistical report), turned me off to her character. Instead of recognizing how awful she'd been, she threw a hissy fit and guilted the Bradfords. Made me miss the original mother, who'd unfortunetly, passed away in real life! Later seasons were much better.",1488240000,,563,5.0
