6890350,5,B00QYR398S,If you are not watching this you should be! More fun in one hour than you can believe.,1423785600,,86,3.8333333333333335
6890351,5,B00QYR398S,"I love this series for so many reasons, but mainly because the characters are perfectly flawed. How often do you find an amazing show, only to have the entire cast look like Barbie? None of it fits the time period and is so unrealistic that I get lost in the details.",1423440000,,267,4.254901960784314
6890352,5,B00QYR398S,"Finally caught up with season 2 yesterday and I still adore them.

Just as before the boys are full of energy, laughter and mischief. I can't help but notice how similar this is to BBC's Robin Hood. Watching them both is so much fun. You never know what they are going to get themselves into OR how they will get out of it, but you know you will have a good time finding out.

I don't want to give anything away so I will just say I am anxious to see where the story-lines lead these guys, especially since one infamous and not so ex, ex-wife has made an appearance. Their creative solutions know no limits. Or rules for that matter. :P",1423267200,,636,4.204918032786885
6890353,5,B00QYR398S,"Cannot say enough about this show!  Everything is here.  Scenery, acting and action all make you feel like a musketeer!  Other versions of this story were good in so many ways.  They were good versions of a good story.

This film really takes you into the scenery and characters in such a unique way.  This was good because I was not disappointed.  Have been watching for this series since the very first time I saw the trailer.  Then, with the interviews and clips, couldn't wait to see it.

The only bad thing is that the rest of the series seems to be slow in coming.",1423008000,3,570,4.352380952380952
6890354,4,B00QYR398S,"Is the guy who plays Athos the son of Mike Hammer?  He has no presence or very little as does D'Artanan.  In most Musketeers renditions these are the two main characters.  On the other hand Aramis is nearly perfect though he doesn't sword fight enough.  Any officianado would know that Aramis is the finest swordsman of the four.  Porthos is also great  one of the best porthos I've seen.  However he is supposed to be somewhat vain which doesn't show in the character.  Still, as a fan of the books,  I enjoy the show.  I will watch and hope that if not Athos then D'artanian will shine more.  Let the great Aramis kick some ass with his sword and let Porthos have his foibles  ... of african decent is not a one of those.",1422748800,2,723,4.313432835820896
6890355,5,B00QYR398S,"Great series, should not be missed.  Full of action, back stabbing and a little romance.  Worth keeping and watching again and again.",1422662400,,133,5.0

6890358,4,B00QYR398S,"GREAT show --- BUT I can't watch unless it has closed captioning.... Amazon is the BEST with CC, but has not added CC to Musketeers season two, hopefully they o, so I can keep watching!",1421539200,,185,4.314285714285714
6890359,5,B00QYR398S,"Ah, the boys are back and better than ever.

I wondered how they would handle Capaldi's exit. I already knew the Cardinal would be declared dead but it seems his influence will be just as strong from the grave. The new villian seems to be much more dangerous, as well. A good season opener. I look forward to the rest of it.

Just one note - kind of confused on how this one is being priced. No season pass? I don't mind paying per episode, even if it'll cost more in the long run but a season pass with reduced pricing would be much appreciated.",1421539200,11,546,4.190476190476191

6890380,5,B00QYR398S,"THE BEST SHOW ON TV! Season 2 picks up about 6 months after where season 1 left off.

6890385,5,B00QYR398S,"I'm hooked!  My daughter found this Season 2 in the Promo rack on Black Friday.  She knew that I had ""The Three Musketeers"" movies and she thought that this was just another ""movie""....as it turns out, it was a series and I watched all 10 episodes in one day.  I did not see Season 1, but was still able to follow along and understood each Season 1 reference that was played out in Season 2.  Didn't take me long to realize that Athos was married to Milady de Winter in Season 1, and that Aramis was the father to Adolphin (even before it was revealed in episode 10).  My hopes are to purchase Season 1 and Season 3 so I can have a full set.  I love these kind of movies, but I especially love actors with long hair!  D' Artagnan has won my heart.  Kevin Sorbo from the Hercules series would be my second choice.  I would absolutely recommend this series to everyone who loves adventure.",1483920000,,887,4.263473053892215

6890391,5,B00QYR398S,"Now a full musketeer, D'artagnan finds his attention increasingly more divided by his sworn loyalty to the musketeers and their king, and the woman he loves but cannot have. Coming to his own, the 2nd season shows some of the best one-on-one duels with D'artagnan, showcasing the full magnitude of his skill and ability to channel anger into punishment. As a Spanish spy begins to whisper in the king's ear, inching ever closer to the throne, the Musketeers find themselves in a losing battle of wits and deception. This perhaps the most satisfying season on dealing out swift ends to the people who deserve it.",1482278400,,611,4.828571428571428
6890392,5,B00QYR398S,"This is an extremely entertaining, beautifully shot series with flawless casting of likable performers.  A witty, action-packed show with limited sex and violence, a complete change from the highly exploitive productions generally made these days.

6890398,5,B00QYR398S,"Season 2 finishes the Musketeers story as we all know it.  It's a great retelling, using history of the area and time to fill in the blanks and make the story very real.  Like the first season, the locations, costumes and horses are beautiful.  Each episode delves into the personality of each Musketeer, enlarging the character and making him a complete person, not just a Musketeer.",1479254400,,384,4.787878787878788

I am glad I have Hulu because the BBC did not broadcast the 3rd season It is only on Hulu. I have never been into shows that are about the Musketeers or show similar so I watched the first season on a whim and I am so glad I watched it. It is done so well that I have watched the 1st and 2nd season three times already. The acting is great. I am just sorry that the season ends with season 3. I am just watching season 3 now because it just became available this past weekend on Hulu.

6890496,4,B00QYR398S,"I find with all of these serial shows, it takes the first year to establish the story line, and for the actors to develop their characters, which appears to have happened here. One thing that irks me about this series, is the inattention to the detail of the clothing of the Musketeers, which is obviously more functional than if they were to be wearing reproduction period clothing, that may in reality, be as hazardous in the action scenes to the actors (who  perhaps have been raised wearing speedos), as appearing in the court of the french Monarch wearing their de rigeur 'barn cleaning attire'. It wouldn't have happened. Also, their manners were not in keeping with who they were supposed to be, and in reality, would have resulted in their consequent tortures and / or execution, for their effortless attitudes of impertinence and insubordination, that would  have been acceptable in a tavern scene, but probably may have been deemed treasonous in the presence of the real King Louis.
The cinematography was sumptuous, apparently all having been 'Photo-Shopped' and in HD, with many of the sets being in palaces in the Czech Republic which were beautiful,although not as opulent  as were the courts and palaces of Louis XIV, synergized with the producer's penchant for using light pastel colouring for the clothing of the aristocrats, especially the ladies of royalty and nobility.
I found that the writings and story line of Dumas were more recognizable in the season 2 series than they were for me in Season 1, which enhanced the entertainment. Furthermore, I think that the acting improved in all of the facets of the scenes, whether they be action, drama, comedy, or suspense.
In other words: In no time, I was simply enjoying the show. I will probably buy season 3 when it is released.",1438905600,,1798,4.888524590163934

Once season 1 got its feet under it and found its pace, I was all-in for these adventures! Season 2 is also fun and full of action and drama, with touches of comedic moments to lighten the serious moments and show the camaraderie between the Musketeers. There are a few lulls in season 2 but they are short and minor, and overall the action is wonderful. I can't wait for season 3!",1436572800,,557,4.314285714285714

Unfortunately, there is only DTS-HD MA 2.0 audio, not full 5.1 audio, which is a HUGE mistake. I really notice the lack of subwoofer when the gunfire and explosions start happening. And full surround sound would have added greatly to the excellent settings and realism of the show. That being said, this was a must-buy for me, regardless of the less-than-spectacular audio.

One final note: Amazon has begun selling items ""exclusively for Prime Members"" and restricting free shipping only if you agree to a free trial of Amazon Prime (which was a complication I simply did not want). I found this infuriating and have begun shopping elsewhere, after having shopped on Amazon for many years.

So, sorry. I digress.

This season is actually a bit better. Perhaps it's because the characters have been fleshed out so there is something to care about? Maybe it's better writing. The characters aren't so one dimensional anymore. The actors have stepped up their game as well. The blend of Dumas + modern twist and period + modern feel was irritating to me in the first season. It now seems ""right."" It's hard to replace a cornerstone character like the Cardinal, but the new villain does a superb job. It works.",1434499200,,752,4.481751824817518

Love the understated acting by Tom Burke- quiet, soft speaking- but still authoritarian when need be -  only saw him bellow out 2 times, I believe, in  the second season.  Love how they have incorporated the individual back stories gradually.  Have always wanted to read Dumas' book- now I am.  Knowing that theatrical and literary are different but both do add a dimension -if done right- to the story.  This is one that I am glad to have seen this series.  Other Musketeers films I liked- but were short- not detailed and actually campy.  Great for family watching and maybe inspire some to research the people, and times.

6890541,5,B00QYR398S,"I was worried upon hearing the departure of Cardinal Richelieu since he was such a soulful villain, but the second season, if possible, is even better.  The suspense builds throughout all the episodes towards the King's believable paranoia and Rochefort's rise to power, but the last three episodes are masterful as we near the climax of the season.  Of course, the four musketeers are all wonderful, and when I read that other viewers have favorites, I'm not sure how that is possible since all four are amazing actors and, which doesn't hurt, handsome men as well.  A special nod to Alexandra Dowling, Queen Anne, for the scene in which Rochefort has come to execute her.  With so few words, she is incredibly believable as she stoically and majestically accepts her fate.  That scene is worth the wait.",1433289600,,805,4.846715328467154

6890560,5,B00QYR398S,I'm in love with this show. At first I was a little hesitant to watch it. I thought it would be the same ole stuff I watched growing up. It wasn't. Pleasantly Surprised. Action packed and plenty of humor. Hats off to these fabulous Actors. Made me fall in love with all the characters. Watched second series first then the first. A bit backwards but I am glad I did. Totally hooked. If Women were seen differently back in those days. Constance would of made an AWESOME Musketeer. She is so fearless. Bring on the next Season!,1431820800,,525,4.422680412371134
6890561,5,B00QYR398S,"This British series about the 17th century French musketeers (that's the underlying joke/British accents) is so much fun that I hope it continues for many more seasons.  I love the leather, metal, sword fighting, and mud.  The scenery, slums, ruins, and royal chambers are spectacular and the wardrobe director should be knighted.  The actors are marvelous, especially with their facial expressions.  I laugh out loud at the quips delivered with riotous understatement and innocent knowing looks.  The female characters are powerfully good and evil and able.  The strength of the storyline is in the four very different and complex characters of the musketeers shaped by their histories and yet able to work (fight) together seamlessly to serve king (Louis, quite the amusing buffoon) and country for little pay and no honor or glory.  ""All for one and one for all.""  Even the episode titles bring a smile to my face:  ""Knight Takes Queen"" (in a nunnery, of course).  Three cheers for the four musketeers . . . and their magnificent horses.  Grunge never looked so good.",1431820800,,1070,5.0227272727272725

6890564,4,B00QYR398S,"I began watching season 2 with disappointment that the Cardinal was dead.
Then finding out that his replacement was clearly introduced as a new antagonist who the writers decided to expose as a traitor from the beginning.
I came to the conclusion that the series had been cancelled, and all this season was simply to end it.
I was happy to find that was not the case.
The settings are superb, costuming best in the business, and the cast has filled their shoes with no one lacking.
It is my hope that the writers will improve on continuity of story line, and leave some suspense/mystery as to what is going on, rather than make it so predictable.
I'm hooked because I love knights, castles, and swashbuckling adventure.
Touche!",1431388800,,727,4.6875
6890565,3,B00QYR398S,"Not nearly as good as the first season. The writers/producers/et al chose to focus on periphery characters too much and not enough on the leads for whom the series is named. That, and some dodgy writing and direction choices and it just wasn't as good. Sadly, the maligned two of the leads whose characters I adored in the first season. It didn't make much sense. Why redirect when the first season was so successful. It needed some stronger direction after season 1 but this wasn't that. This was odd. And when we only get 10 episodes in a season, this was a waste of time on what was a good start.

Bottom line, I only purchased the 2nd season to support the show and in hopes they do better for season 3. I won't be so inclined to lay out this kind of money going forward if the end result is anything close to this.",1431388800,,819,4.283870967741936
6890566,3,B00QYR398S,"This second season wasn't as good as the first.  In keeping one story line going for the whole season, the writers lost a lot of the humor and friendship between the Musketeers.  Sometimes I wondered if they even knew each other. Their friendship and escapades seem to be missing.  The king's personality changed, and he became a real dumb a-- uncaring of the people around him who have always helped him.  I didn't like the ""thug"" who replaced the priest, and was glad to see him go.  I hope for the third season, the writers for the first season are rehired and the comraderie between the musketeers is brought back.",1431302400,4,618,4.581818181818182

6890572,5,B00QYR398S,"I bought the second season right after watching the entire first season.  The second season only got better.  I really like the way we can get more into the history and past of the Musketeers and what made them the men they are today.  The delicate balance that had to be walked within the royal court reminds me of what Heidi Klum says to the designers each week - One day you're in and the next you're out.  How true that was when so many people were looking out only for their own gain of wealth or power.  Where love had to take a back seat to position at times and royal matches were political.  I have always enjoyed British television series whether they were comedies, drama, or action/adventure.  BBC has hit the mark with The Musketeers.  I can't wait until this summer when season 3 begins.",1430870400,,801,4.401360544217687

  The inner stories are riveting, (and there is plenty of them), the acting and chemistry of the cast is simply superb, and you haven't yet began to mention the magnificent cinematography, which will please the most demanding period lover.

It reminds me a lot of the swash buckler movies of years ago with the likes of Don Ameche  and Gene Kelley. As a young kid I thoroughly enjoyed these types of  movies. The young actors in this version are very talented and portray the characters with great aplomb. There are serious dramatic moments but these situations are usually resolved in favor of the good guys. If you want to watch a show that will entertain you for about an hour and you are willing to forego reality this is the show for you.

6890596,5,B00QYR398S,"A Few months back when I - purely by coincidence - came across the first series of ""The Musketeers"" i was a very happy camper indeed. I thought this new BBC-show was the best peace of television i had seen in years. I had barely finished the first series, when I started researching the possibility of a second series and I was deligthed to learn that not only was a second series in the pipeline, but it was actually very close to its release on dvd.
I have just finished watching the second series and I was not at all disappointed. The second series is every bit as good as its predecessor. In fact I only have one negative comment to make: The second series is far to short. Usually when production-companies wish to launch a new show, they either release a pilot or start off with a short first series, while the following series tend to be quite a bit longer - mostly 20 or more episodes - but this is not the case with ""The Musketeers"" series 2, which only contains a lousy 10 episodes. This however is just one small critic in a show, which continoues to impress me.
The story is wellknown - or is it ? In this series we witness Mylady De Winther join the heroes and redeem herself. Something she certainly didn't do in Alexandre Dumas' original novels. And we witness Rochefort rise to become the new first minister upon Cardinal Richelieu's death. Also not in in the novels. But then this show has always taken quite a few artistic liberties, regarding the original story-line. The people behind the show have however yet again managed to capture the essence of of Dumas' novels and as a result the show remains one of the strongest interpretations of Dumas' beloved musketeer stories along with the movies directed by Richard Lester and made by Disney back in the mid-seventies
Left is only to hope for more from BBC's intrepid musketeer-franchise. Please dear Sirs. Can I have some more?",1428796800,,1899,4.555555555555555

6890632,4,B00QYR398S,"This is a great series, I have completed both seasons, and I hope for a third.
However I do seriously question one thing.
 The musketeers being ,Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, were all French.  So,...
Is there such a shortage of French actors that this casting director had to resort to Mexicans.
Maybe they just work cheaper?,....I see they are doing all the commercials now,..
It really took away from the show, although I liked all the characters,  I think maybe there was another place for them somewhere.
 No cast could ever top that of ""The Iron Mask"",  in comparison to,...this show is a good example of how easy it must be to get an acting job these days.",1427155200,2,672,4.61344537815126

I like all the actors from other things that they were very good in so it was good to see them come together in the this. There is nice depth to each and their back stories each come in to the story lines with good timing and good balance, never too forced and it allows for a couple different points you are waiting conclusions on give you small satisfactions along the way as you see some stories resolve under the larger story.",1427068800,,595,4.3125

I really enjoyed the  Musketeers training camp video. That shows how the producers have prepared the Musketeers for the roll they portray. Great job! I enjoy watching the action and adventure, and also keeping the actors true to character. You can tell that they have done their homework. If you are a Musketeers fan and have watched all the movies about the Musketeers and have read the book you can see how all have taken the story in various directions and have made them all exciting. They may not have everything in chronological order, but all the adventure is there. I do have to say that this series is exciting, intriguing and seductive. All the actors especially Tom, Santiago, Luke, and Howard, that portray the Musketeers are fantastic! I love watching all of them, as well as all the actors in the series. GREAT SERIES! I love those Musketeers!",1425945600,,992,4.734104046242774
6890657,5,B00QYR398S,"So, I think this show is great!  There's plenty of action, intrigue and romance.  The characters are well-fleshed, but have plenty of room to grow and and reveal new secrets about themselves.  Where Richeleu is scheming but devoted to France, Rochefort is severely unbalanced and cares only for himself.  He makes for a villian that you can't wait to see fall - and hopefully before the damage is too great.  For those who think the Athos character is dull, I beg to differ.  Athos is the ideal stoic and therefore isn't meant to be overly emotional, yet he is constantly dealing with his love for Lady de Winter and the feelings caused by her betrayal.  And yet he is an efficient leader who lacks much of the inner doubt the other musketeers deal with.

Anyways, watch the show!  It's fun and sexy without going over the edge into overly foul language or gratuitous shedding of clothes.  Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of both, but my point is this is a cool show that should appeal to free-thinking and family oriented folk.",1425945600,,1027,4.532608695652174

I came across season one , which was free for prime and had been rabid for season two.  Of course the book was a childhood favorite and I have watched several movies about The Three Musketeers.  Of course, as a woman, I love (and swoon over) each musketeer, and the twisted plots keep me on edge.  Initially, my least favorite character was King Louis but as the series advanced I realised what a brilliant actor Ryan Gage is.  They could not have cast any better actor...he is absolutely brilliant in his role!  I hope BBC continues this show.  I have seen so many highly rated shows cancelled and if The Musketeers were to be flushed into the TV sewer, my heart will shatter in a million pieces.  Bravo to BBC and all for a great show!

I have many reasons but the main one is the inclusion of color in the cast particularly with Porthos and the intense masculinity of the four. I am not a lover of violence, but I actually enjoy the fight scenes where the four get to throw some of that testosterone around. Also each of them has his own personality which helps the story lines move along nicely. Among the ladies, Constance is my favorite because she's D'Artagnan's love interest and she's not afraid to jump in and help the guys in a pinch. Finally, I love the idea that the Musketeers are the elite troops employed in the protection of the king and queen and have the skills and battle strategies to match.",1425081600,,820,4.366013071895424

I am so invested, even I cannot believe how much I am looking forward to the conclusion. And I am on pins and needles waiting......Hope everyone returns for season 3.
I believe that BBC will be making a huge error if they resort to trying to focus on only one character. It should focus on the four male leads and the females in their lives, not on any one single person. The female leads add depth to the otherwise neglected feelings of the men, which are often overlooked in daily life.",1425081600,,881,4.478260869565218

I know the stories don't always follow the Dumas books completely, but each episode is a burst of the original with new elements that blend into the original work.  The production and characters. plot lines and added details are seldom if ever out of place.  I like the different characters each getting opportunities to be a major player and look forward to learning more about the origin of the King's Musketeers, and perhaps some flashbacks to the time when the older characters were younger and more involved in the legend.
