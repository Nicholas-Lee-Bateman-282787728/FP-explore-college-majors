393499,3,6301969294,"Ayn Rand not only wrote the screenplay for this film based on her classic novel, she was, according to most reports, in favor of casting Gary Cooper  as her architect hero Howard Roark.  That proved to be a mistake.  Not only  is Cooper too ""mature"" for the role, he lacks the necessary  passion to deliver Rand's philisophical speeches with conviction.  Despite  this misstep, ""The Fountainhead"" is a pretty faithful summary (as  opposed to adaptation) of the legendary novel, and though it is far from  perfect, the fact that Warner Bros. would even undertake such a radical  project shows that the movie moguls of the past (such as Jack L. Warner)  had a lot more vision and courage than the folks running the show in  Hollywood today.  The rest of the cast is quite good, and King Vidor's  direction is masterful.  The camera angles, the cinematography, and set  design are all splendidly offbeat, making this film worthwhile for its  visual qualities alone.",927244800,107,962,4.875776397515528

Patricia Neal is superb as is the rest of the cast.  This movie  will tug at the heartstrings of everyone who has or is trying so hard to be  a bright light in an ever dimming world.

393563,5,6301969294,The heat from the screen/off-screen love affair between Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal is so palpable that you almost feel like you're intruding on them.  They don't make movies like this anymore -- the sex appeal is subtle not in your face with either actor yet you don't feel uncomfortable watching the interaction between them.  Raymond Massey as a counter point between the two is just wonderful.  He's clueless to the attraction and I guess it's because he too has an attraction to Cooper.  Interesting and entertaining movie.  Very apropo to the present.,1509494400,,559,4.967741935483871

393613,5,6301969294,"Howard Roark, independent architect, is determined to do it his way or not. To make ends meet during lean times he gets a day job at a rock quarry. There he meats his match and bets literally wiped by the boss's daughter Dominique Francon (Patricia Neal.) they both seem to know more of the world than most people do. She works for a newspaper and to punisher self for falling in love with Howard marries her boss Gail Wynand (Raymond Massy.) This does not denture Howard form building Gail and Dominique their dream house. Eventually getting the chance of a lifetime to build low-income housing through another architect, he jumps at the chance as long as it means only doing it the Howard Roark way. Watch the movie to find out what happens and why he is such a stickler for the work of the individual.

You can argue about film versus book until the cows come home. You could say, ""Let's make this with Helen Mirren and Mel Gibson."" You can even have Turner colonize it. Well folks, it is not going to happen; so do not waste your time wishing, and look at this movie.

This is a pretty faithful summary (as opposed to adaptation). In that, you get the essence of the book with a few saved speeches. All the actors get their point over to you: this includes Gary Cooper as Howard Roark (he purposely looks stoic and amused) and Patricia Neal as Dominique (looking frustrated and aloof.)

The scenes, black and white with exaggerated camera angles, portray the story very well. The Frank Lloyd Wright architecture adds to the time period. The tone of the movie gives the impression that this was copied from a stage play where one person at a time talks and no one overlaps until the first person is finished.

All in all, the entire movie is worth the viewing. And reviewing for the details.",1501286400,,1794,4.527777777777778

393618,5,6301969294,"Who has the guts, fortitude, and stamina to be an uncompromising individual in the face of crushing forces determined to coerce compromise and concession at any cost? Few did when the novel The Fountainhead was written or the film was released and fewer still today. Although I am an admirer of Ayn Rands philosophy, the basis for this film, that isn't the element of film I find most intriguing.

I love the way Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal look at one another; it exemplifies longing, lust, fascination, even love-at-first-sight, if you believe that sort of thing. The scene at the quarry where their eyes first meet personifies masculinity and femininity, at least for me. There is a pervasive oozing sexuality throughout this film which makes it impossible to turn awayeven if you disagree with Rands philosophy, on full display throughout. This is genius filmmaking. The affair between Cooper and Neal which blossomed at this time is obvious.

I love Patricia Neal in this film, even more so than her Oscar winning turn in Hud. I believe her performances in The Fountainhead and A Face in the Crowd are her best. Robert Douglas as Ellsworth Toohey is perfect as the haughty villain, eager to crush genius and greatness because he could not control it. Gary Cooper has been highly praised for his performances, particularly in High Noon, but for me Patricia Neals surpasses his. Her character Dominique Francon/Wynand personifies feminine beauty and strength. No actress has done better. Cooper was described as taciturn in the special features, and I think thats fairly apt. He is all dedication and insistent in this film, not demonstrative at all.

The correct choice was made to have Rand herself pen the screenplay and for Rand to insist not one line be changed-exactly the same way the Roark character insists not one detail of his architectural designs be changed. Director King Vidor then expertly adapted the story for the screen, enhancing the plot rather than reinventing it.  The Fountainheads style make be dated, but its message and hypnotic appeal endure. This is a must-see.",1493942400,,2095,5.011494252873563

393715,3,6301969294,"I give the film three stars for being well made and well acted. Zero stars for Rand's philosophy.  One can see the influence of Citizen Kane in this movie. The idealism of the individual is ridiculous, but rampant in the political and CEO mentality in our country. Rand's ideas are summarized in Roark's speech towards the end of the movie. At the end, we see this magnificent building with Roark standing at the top as if he built the entire structure by himself. But he would not have been standing on the top of anything without the help of construction workers, plumbers, electricians as well as those who provided the materials to construct the edifice.

I applaud the great individuals who stand out against the crowd with a sense of independence and integrity. But our world is interconnected. None of us achieve without the help many others. Most of the great individualists understand and acknowledge this. Those who won't are the narcissists of our age. The may achieve, but they are in essence little people. Great things are accomplished by groups of people, formally or informally working together.",1486252800,,1111,4.904255319148936

393950,5,6301969294,"The excellent film adaptation of Ayn Rand's classic anti Communist fable of one of the greatest literary archetypes of the rugged individualist of all time on DVD--what's not to love?

Picture and sound quality is quite good.

As a conservative Christian, I don't necessarily represent the majority of my peers in my love for this film--as there are many criticisms of Rand and Libertarianism from a Christian ethnonationalist and Theonomist perspective, but I tend to think many of those same fine folks are overly harsh towards and overly dismissive of the philosophical merits of Rand's characters and storyline in ""The Fountainhead.""  Make no mistake, if you are a Christian, you will doubtless find it lacking in a proper Christian perspective, despite the powerful principles upheld and conveyed in the story.  Yet the conveyance of those principles and clear message of truth prevailing over the lie makes it worth watching at least once.

The film is acted out in a comically melodramatic way in places, and some will doubtless find the extremity and austerity of the characters to be a bit annoying.  (like my wife, who insisted that all of them would be diagnosed with severe psychological issue were they alive today, haha)

I think this may well have been done on purpose though, given those very extremes of the characters and the political narrative that is woven into the storyline--and that Rand was at least on some level writing the story as a bit of an allegory.  If she wasn't her style of storytelling certainly lends itself well to allegory.
But at any rate, it's rare even for movies of the time period this was made in to be so laden with a positive political message and it's all too common for what principles and convictions an author does weave into a story to be mostly if not altogether lost in the film adaptation.  (Consider the frequent complaint from fans of a book series about film adaptations.)
Ms. Rand however, was directly involved in the production of this film--which probably overwhelmingly accounts for the film's faithful adaptation of her original story.

Gary Cooper is sure to please most who love his work, as his classic rugged good guy persona is in full affect with his portrayal of Howard Roarke.

I rank this film right up with Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, Meet John Doe and 12 Angry Men as films that depict a bygone era where society functioned mostly as it ought, and that when it didn't, there were always men to take a stand and make things right.  Even when that meant standing alone.  Films like this, even if unrealistic in some areas, are very realistic and instructive in how brilliantly they portray the desperate struggle between the man of principle and the mob, and more importantly, the ruthless men who manipulate for power and money.  I tend to think the latter far more significant than the former.",1457654400,,2871,4.844580777096114

394220,3,6301969294,"Ayn Rand is my very favorite author.  What they did to this book is a real travesty of justice.  The story line is distorted and the acting somewhat melodramatic.  With that said, it still brings out the message that is so sorely missing in todays world, how to be an individual who sticks to their principles and convictions.  Gary Cooper is great as Howard Roark and would have made a great John Gault also (Atlas Shrugged).  Pat Neal is also a joy.  If you collect Rand memories, you should purchase this title, knowing you will be disappointed in the presentation, but awed by the dynamic acting duo representing the heros of the story.",1437955200,,640,4.619469026548672
394221,2,6301969294,"Am I the only one who feels that Patricia Neal's strong screen presence makes one wish that hers was the central character of this movie?
Unfortunately, The Fountainhead focuses on the expressionless face of the aged, emotionless Cooper as one man confronting the restrictiveness of society and his own impact on it. This is High Noon for male architects.
The Fountainhead self-consciously and overtly tries to appear the most modern of movies in its theme, decor, and treatment of the individual as autonomous life force, but falls flat on its face by the suffocatingly limited, stereotypical portrayal of woman as individual. Neal's strong character eventually meets the fate of what would develop into a commonplace occurrence for women's roles in the films of the 1950s (and in the Western genre as a whole) -- she proudly and definitively becomes a ""Mrs."" Once the wedding dress is donned, Neal's character falls into a supportive role and the development of her character grinds to a halt. Rand's anti-Communist preachy dialogue focuses on the link between non-conformity and greatness, but sudden marriage for Neal's dynamic character strongly implies that this greatness of the individual effort belongs specifically to men and not to women. The theme of man as hero and woman as worshipper no doubt is the stuff of fantasy for some, but underscores this film's failed attempt at modernity, dating this film irretrievably for the modern viewer. One recalls the strong female roles in the Hollywood films of the 30s and 40s, and one realizes that this 1949 film is ushering in what is the darkest and most limiting era for female roles, the horrendous 1950s (although some might consider the films of the 1970s to be even worse in this regard). This is essentially a boys' film, and has more in common with a John Wayne Western than many would like to admit. It's another shootout at the OK corral, only words are used instead of guns, a Hollywood vision of masculinity that says only men can shape their world to reflect what they want. This film will appeal to those who prefer their protagonists to be heroic men, and their women beautiful and dutiful -- and unarmed. *yawn*",1437523200,,2184,4.9375

It took three movies to try to cover ""Atlas Shrugged"" and even they barely scratched the surface.  Gary Cooper's portrayal of Roark was restrained, which is what was needed.

Gary Cooper doesn't disappoint as the determined and amazingly resourceful Howard Roark.  Betrayed by friends, Roark's unyielding commitment to his values in the face of overwhelming adversity is inspirational.

I actually prefer THE FOUNTAINHEAD to Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED, the latter of which is a far more-involved study depicting the endless struggle between individualism and collectivism.  Anyone who is a strong individualist is likely to appreciate the motif in THE FOUNTAINHEAD as Roark is repeatedly pulled between his individualistic convictions and the burdens others place upon him as they endeavor to draw him into a collectivist web of deceit, mediocrity and anonymity.

Was it 100% faithful to the book? No, and there's a lot of stuff in the book that isn't in the movie, but the most important stuff is there. Overall, this is a rallying cry for individualists, this is extremely important in our current age, now that the collectivists are in charge. Even if you hate black and white films, chances are you'll love this. And I'm saying that as someone that generally hates love stories, but I make an exception with Ayn Rand, because Rand only used romance to communicate her ideas, and because objectivism isn't anti-love, instead it believes love is an exchange of values, not something to sacrifice or suffer form.

Now some people have hated the Fountainhead over the ""rape"" scene, that moment when Roark enter's the heroine house and makes loves to her. However, this movie shows what the book shows, that she beat his face with a whip first, so she kinda had it coming, and it wasn't like she resisted.

394724,4,6301969294,"There is much to be concerned about in this typical election year of heated and superficial political vituperation that goes under the wholly misleading name of debate.  As a teacher at a Christian school, I am more troubled by the peculiar attraction that the militantly atheist writer Ayn Rand (1905-1982) holds for a number self-styled, rightwing libertarian Christians.
 Ayn Rands objectivist philosophy holds to several explicitly anti-Christian tenets.  According to Rand, all knowledge is based upon sense perception, and reason interprets the data provided by sense perception.  Consequently, she rejects the Christian belief in revelation and in God, who in some fashion is beyond the reach of sovereign reason and sense perception.  In ethics she supports rational egoism, which argues that the happiness of the individual is found in pursuing his own interests and thus refusing to sacrifice himself for others.  Such an ethics is hardly conducive to a Christian lifestyle based upon the God who gave of himself on the cross for others.  Finally, according to Rand, society prospers when the elite of creative and strong individuals is allowed to pursue its artistic and scientific visions.  Once again, this runs contrary to the Lord who taught that the meek will inherit the earth.
 For those who, like me, do not want to wade through Rands philosophical essays and long novels (The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged), I would recommend viewing the 1949 movie The Fountainhead.  Since she wrote the script and zealously guarded its integrity, the film is an accurate portrayal of her philosophy.  While the film is overly melodramatic, it is enjoyable, has an outstanding cast and some stunning visual effects.
 The story is about Howard Roark, played by Gary Cooper, an architect who will not compromise his unique artistic vision to the mediocrity and vulgarity of the crowd.  His strength and integrity convert the cynical newspaper publisher Gail Wynand and wins the heart of the bored and disillusioned socialite and columnist Dominique Francon, played respectively and effectively by Raymond Massey and Patricia Neal.  All three despise the mob mentality of the common man.  Roark emerges triumphant at the end of the film.
 From the perspective of a Christian, Rands film is a paean to the great man.  Its superman elitism is clearly in tension with the biblical view that all men are created in the image of God.  It is destructive because only the very few can live up to its creed.  All others fail in the attempt, as is shown by the suicide of Wynand, who could not resist the pressure of society to conform.  Its idolatry is explicit in the closing scene in which Dominique, ascending to the heights in an elevator, worshipfully gazes at Roark standing godlike against the wind at the top of his new skyscraper.
 Two anecdotes surrounding the movie are quite telling.  The first illustrates the human failure of Rands philosophy in contrast to the Christianity that she rejected.  I could mention the poisonous relationships between Rand and her objectivist followers, but instead will tell the stories of Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal.  They began an affair while making the film.  In order to demonstrate their support for Rands philosophical egoism, they made the affair public but, after breaking up, discovered in the end that Rands philosophy was not the source of true happiness.  Late in his life Gary Cooper converted to Roman Catholicism.  Patricia Neal, who was later reconciled to Coopers wife and daughter, also converted to Roman Catholicism four months before she died.
  Finally, the special features commentary on the DVD states that Hollywood was hesitant to produce the film because of its anti-Christian message.  By this they meant that it opposed the Christian ideal of love and sacrificial service to others.  Strangely and unfortunately, sixty-three years later there is a segment of the American Christian population that is attracted to Ayn Rands ideas, and sadly, it is doubtful that Hollywood still associates Christianity with sacrificial love.  May God forgive us.",1403913600,,4117,5.181543116490166

To me it was like watching Gone With the Wind (1939) but set in the 20th century. A movie on a grand scale. The Fountainhead combines noir-romance with psychological-drama.  Few thing every viewer should know about this film on the sidelines:

1) The movie is based on the controversial novel The Fountainhead written by Ayn Rand in 1943.
2) The movie most likely served the purpose of promoting individualism (capitalism) v. collectivism (socialism) in the cold war times (propaganda).
3) Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper make a very convincing couple on the screen, whenever these two meet, sparks fly. (These two had an affair on the set of the film, an affair that haunted them for the rest of their lives).

The acting is a little stiff but this was normal for that time period. I would have liked it better if the beginning of the story line hadn't been so rushed and bypassed how they got from point a to b but when you have a book as long as the contained its a little crazy to expect everything from the book to be in the movie.  The last half of the book was represented nicely in the movie. And they were able to include some of the suspense and the heartbreak from the book that made watching the movie worthwhile.
  If you are not into old movies or can appreciate those differences you will be disappointed. If you do like them or can watch it with the knowledge that it's not like watching a movie made today I believe you will find it enjoyable. I would suggest reading the book first, or at least the first half because if you don't know the story it's kind of like coming in half way thru the show.

Gary Cooper to my mind was a little too old to be playing Howard Roark but he definitely characterized him well, especially in the final speech that he gives in the courtroom.  It was right out of the novel and very effective.  A young Patricia Neal as Dominique was overplayed.  In the book she is a very intelligent cool customer and doesn't become emotionally overwrought like is portrayed in a few scenes.  Raymond Massey as Gail Wynand was good, but again the ending is over dramatized.  What happens to Wynand in the film doesn't occur in the book.

The movie was done in black and white which to me was very effective.  It was easier to look at buildings in that aspect and look at their lines and the modern approach that Roark took in his designs.

I was approached by one of the council members and told her I couldn't join until Id found out if they were Communists, Socialists, Bolsheviks, or Nazis but that I shied away from any such group.

Of course the audio version of the book is around 40 hours long, maybe even longer. There are significant limitations. I agree with the other comments that the movie is incredibly overacted. The characters in the book are much more cool, calm, thoughtful, collected and calculating. The casting is okay. But I honestly think in the film Patricia Neal as Dominique Francon really nails it and steals the show in the screeen version. In the book she is a bit over the edge as in the movie. I also agree with another review that Gary Cooper is too mature for the screen role of Roark. This aspect is utterly shocking. But Ayn Rand was supposedly in love with him, so I get it. In the book Roark is in his early 20's at the beginning of the story. Roark is not this slow moving old guy we see in the movie. It's the very opposite actually. For those of you who love this movie and have never read the book, I honestly don't know what to say to you. The book is so incredibly long and detailed.

that the constitution of the united states of america's basic principle is indiviualism
not collectiivism,and that principle is man's inalienable right which means it can not

Patricia Neal is so sultry in this film that you can literally feel the passion she displays for Cooper. I had the feeling that the film may have been based on Frank Lloyd Wright.

The ruthless man who wanted to build his power by manipulating others. The older man who fought the good fight, but gave up at the end. The hero who would be true to himself no matter what.

I can't imagine the actors going along with this thing without busting into a Howard Roark-like temper tantrum over how no one speaks that way nor could anyone make the dialogue, the plot, or any of the atrocious non-human relationships sound even remotely plausible.

There are elements of the plot that I can find appealing such as the social commentary about the world being unappreciative of talent but this movie is the epitome of all that is true in that statement.

395620,1,6301969294,"In recent years as Ayn Rand became more and more known in public discourse I have often wondered why I had never heard of this so-called ""classic"" film, The Fountainhead.
As soon as the opening credits ended I soon learned that this was a hopelessly didactic series of characters exchanging speeches at each other in long winded, completely unrealistic dialog.
The line that the world was engaged in an orgy of self-sacrificing made me laugh out loud.
First, I am admirer of pre-war New York City Architecture as the overwhelming majority of people today are. So, the structures this leading man advocates are, today, also, regarded as eyesores than triumphs of individualism or anything other than, perhaps, corporate greed since they are cheaper to build than pre-war style buildings.
Second, the concept of building a building or, say, writing a book or making a movie without any concern whatsoever that anybody in the world beside the author or architect will enjoy it is absurd. Creating something without even considering if others will enjoy it would be like sending Christmas gifts at people with no hope or desire for the receiver of your gift to ever want to use this gift.
I can easily imagine Ayn Rand wrapping her own books and other unwanted things out to people who do not wish to read it as fulfilling her Christmas shopping, if she exchanged gifts with people at all. She would only be concerned if she liked wrapping the gifts, not if it will soon enter a garbage or be sent to Goodwill.
Third, towards the end, the lead character is far more like Timothy McVeigh than some kind of an adorable hero.

Ayn Rand was actively involved in getting this film to the screen, including writing the screenplay.  A great book, as always, is better than a movie made from it can ever be.  Today rational self-interest is increasingly thought of as evil while tribalism, or group think, is praised as superior.  This movie can help inspire people to live happy self-directed lives, to think, to rely on reason rather than emotion.

I am no fan of Ayn Rand's philosopy, but this is a passionate, melodramatic, stylish treatment of a rather banal allegory about the architecture of integrity.  The acting is over the top as these characters make the most of the soapbox given them, but even more fascinating are the costumes and decor, which puts the Jetsons back in the '40s, for a glamorous mood framing this intense romance.  In terms of the story's moral, however, I kept thinking that in real life, the people making the biggest fuss about ""individualism"" herein are the least likely to walk the walk.

I use this film with my Philosophy Class along with a study guide I have developed.  It works great giving the student a look at a Classic movie and Ayn Rand's philosophy of the Mind, individualistic creativity and selfishness or egoism (in the positive sense).  Plus it gives them a chance to draw out the philosophical truths in the film compared to their textbook.

After all, his destruction of the buildings can only be described as an act of terrorism, and his defense of his actions reminds me how the Weather Underground described their use of violence in the 1970's.

The characters are 2-dimensional archetypes rather than actual people.  The Rand books tend to be more popular among the young.  Once you grow up and live in the real world you realize that much of her vision was fantasyland.  She saw the world as black and white.  When you have 7 billion people sharing a planet, you simply can't live by your own rules w/o compromising extensively along the way.

Patricia Neal plays love-interest place holder Dominique Francon who falls in love with Howard because she apparently finds his ""The rest of the world can suck it"" philosophy endearing. Practically all of the rest of the characters fall into two distinct categories, those who respect Howard but just can't live up to his standards or those who hate Howard because they can't live up to his standards. It's a very black and white story (no pun intended) with no gray areas. Like John Galt, Howard Roark is a mystery to lesser men. The mystery to me is how anyone consider this an admirable, much less realistic, mentality. Roark isn't principled, he's a diva. Flat broke, he turns down jobs because he only wants to do what HE wants to do. Imagine having that conversation with a physician:

You: Doctor, I've got this weird growth and it keeps getting bigger.
Doctor: Oh, sorry. I don't do growths. My only passion in life is treating rashes with topical creams.
You: But I'm really worried. What if it's cancer? Can't you run some tests?
Doctor: Nope, sorry. That would be compromising my principles. Why would you ask me to do that? Come back when you have a rash.

It isn't a story about principles, it's about a grown man with the mentality of a spoiled child who wins in the end only because he's a character in a book. Holding oneself to a high standard is admirable. So is pursuing a dream. But in the real world necessity and practicality are also (major) considerations. There's no shame in doing a day's work for a day's pay. It doesn't make you sheep, it makes you a responsible adult. I think Rand's message is that if everyone is serving their own best interests they will give 100% and society will benefit as a consequence. But most people don't want to pay you to follow YOUR dream or achieve YOUR vision. They want to pay you to provide a good or service that matters to THEM.

I found the acting bad.  This has to be Gary Cooper's worst performance.  Most of the actors seemed to be reading their lines rather than acting.  This has to be Raymond Massey worst performance also.

I bought this film because I wanted to gain a more intimate understanding of Rand's perspective.  For me, it was difficult to concentrate on the content, because the acting was too melodramatic.  I suspect that the vision of being over dramatic has changed since 1948.  However, I know other films of that era are better.

The whole thing would work a little better for me if I liked his designs, but they represented radical modernism in 1948, which was the point of the story. I just don't happen to like the sleek modernist buildings most of the time.

Anyway, the point is not whether or not the audience likes his designs. We are to understand that his designs are original, completely original, and that he will not compromise them. And in fact, the compromises offered are sufficiently horrible to make the point. A man of genius knows that a building, or a sculpture or a book or whatever, must have its own internal integrity; it must function as a whole, not a conglomeration of disassociated parts. At one point his proposed sleek modern building (model) is given a Greek temple face toward the street, while the rest of the building remains a large block. It's thoroughly disgusting, and he will have none of it.

So rather than compromise, he goes to work in a stone quarry in New England, where a wealthy and sophisticated young woman played by Patricia Neal (who had a off-screen love affair with Cooper as well as the on-screen one) notices him and makes a play for him. Finally, he is called away to design a building the way he wants to, and at the grand opening of the building, she shows up. She is introduced to Roark, and we discover that she never even learned the name of the stone cutter she seduced.

For reasons that are too complicated to spell out here, she marries her former boss, an older man played by Raymond Massey. Massey asks Roark to design his home, saying it is to be a temple to his beloved wife. (Remember, Roark loves her too.) Roark goes from one success to another, but there's a snag.

An old school friend, a third-rate architect who admits he never did anything original and copied from Roark all the time, asks him to take over the designing of a housing project which is supposed to be for low-cost housing. Roark stipulates that he will design it and let the third-rate guy take the credit and the fees, but only if it is built exactly the way he designs it, with no alteration at all. His old friend agrees, Roark designs it, then goes on vacation while it is built. Predictably, the wimpy third-rate architect gives in to the demands that it be modified, and the results are truly horrible. The thing looks like what it is: a design made by a committee. No unity, no grace, and just plain ugly. Even someone who doesn't much care for modern architecture can see at once it is an abomination.

So Roark blows it up. The crowning of the movie is his speech to the jury at his trial for the crime. It is brilliant, and pure Rand.",1337385600,4,2801,4.495088408644401

396041,3,6301969294,"Ayn Rand wrote about man being the best he can be. This discarded both religion and large government (in some cases the same thing). The book was written to uplift man and to make you think about being the best that you can be. Its basis was that if you were like everyone else, it is mediocrity at best a lousy life. If everyone was a sheep, we would be lead to slaughter. That is it! This means, stand on your own two feet, be the best you can, do the best you can, period. As I mentioned, this did exclude religion and government, so it pretty much ticks many people off. Did this movie capture the essence of the book, sort of. I would say that reading the book and seeing the movie are both unique experiences as Ayn Rand did the screen play, but the subtleties were missed in my opinion. It is hard to capture a book that large in 120 minutes. I travel a lot, I have a kindle (no plug here) and could take the time to read it and understand its meaning. The movie barely gets the little subtleties that made the book so great. It did capture the point of Roark not taking the money from the weaker man even when he was almost completely broke and turning down a job that would have saved him because it was compromised in his view. It is a thinking movie and therefore probably disliked by many shallow just want an escape type of movie people, it is certainly not that. Its relevance to today's political and socio-economic standards is frankly uncanny. She hit a lot of today's issues dead on 70+ years ago? Wow, also, not too many reviews point out her biography as it is interesting in itself. She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905, she saw the Bolshevik revolution and first hand saw her successful family's livelihood taken for the ""greater good"". Her disdain for this is evident in her writings and why so many conservatives like her as she is for capitalism and small government. However, as mentioned above, this disdain is also aimed at religion in which she also sees as a crutch. I personally like the lesson and try to do the best I can at what I do as I feel it is the best way to live, proud of your accomplishments and your integrity. Could I live up to a Howard Roark? I wish! I feel a couple of times in my life when integrity mattered, I took the hit and I will tell you I was alone in a crowded room, but I am not more proud of any other moment(s) in my life other than when my child was born. I think that is her message, when you do something based on integrity when the chips are down, it is a good thing. To my sad realization, I have seen many other situations like this since and seen others who chose to be like Roark as I did get the ugly end of a deal. For the record the last guy I saw hold his integrity in the face of loosing everything was a very religious man. Take it for the deeper meaning, it was meant to move you, not comment on Cooper or the director; those are far from the point of her writings.",1314835200,11,2952,4.171628721541156

You seriously have to be retarded to take Ayn Rand seriously as a 'philosopher'.  She must have been a total idiot to think ANYTHING in this script made sense.

  Also woven into the script is the forbidden love affair between Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal which as biographers write, took place during this movie and after for many years. Their chemistry and their shared beliefs for the right to protect independent and original thought and ideas was well presented. The supporting cast was very believable; especially the unscrupulous newspaper columnist who boasted and then tried to ruin Howard Roark (Gary Cooper in the film) because Roark would not sell out his individuality. The newspaper owner played by Raymond Massey was also done well and entirely believable as well as Massey gives in to Roark's dedication to his architectural independence and winds up a broken man who takes his own life. The drama of the courtroom scene is where the words of Ayn Rand speak the strongest about the strength of individual thought and creative ideas and the right to the ownership of the aforementioned even if it means sacrificing everything and going to jail. Those words were undeniably Ayn Rand albeit spoken by Gary Cooper. Anyone who has read her books knows this.
  This is a timeless movie that you can enjoy again and again especially if you haven't seen it in a few years.

Cooper's penultimate courtroom scene is dynamic - a true merger of author and actor executing together.

Gary Cooper as Howard Roark.  Sure he's a few years older than he should be for this character, but I like him in this role, and I've always been moved by his trial speech, other reviewers to the contrary.

Patricia Neal as Dominique.  She even looks like a younger, more attractive version of Ayn Rand herself.

Also fine cinematography and good supporting performances by Kent Smith as Peter Keating and Henry Hull, Ray Collins, and Jerome Cowan.

The Not-So-Good --

Robert Douglas is a fine villain, but perhaps he's a little too much so as Ellsworth Toohey.  I would have liked to have seen Clifton Webb (""Laura"") in this role.

Raymond Massey is okay, but I've never been comfortable with him as Gail Wynand.  Orson Welles -- still relatively thin and handsome at this point in his career -- as the newspaper publisher (echoes of Citizen Kane) Wynand would've been perfect -- though I understand that Rand was against casting Welles in any role.  Too bad.

The Ugly --

The set design.  A few of the designs that are meant to represent Roark's buildings are okay, but many more are like some bad parody of Frank Lloyd Wright or Richard Neutra.  This is a major flaw in film with an architect as the hero!  One might begin to side with Ellsworth Toohey at some point.

Despite those flaws, this film is very entertaining -- yes, perhaps a bit campy at times -- and well worth checking out -- though the definitive film version of Rand's novel has yet to be made.",1276041600,2,1480,4.545454545454546

396139,1,6301969294,"While I am an enormous fan of Ayn Rand's original novel, this movie is awful. It should have been good. The director (King Vidor) was one of the great directors of early-twentieth century cinema. The cast included such talents as Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, (a young) Patricia Neal, Raymond Massey (who gave, by far, the film's best performance), and others. The original author was intimately involved in the process of the film's creation. The source material was fantastic. So what went wrong? Three things, in my opinion:

1) The Acting and the Script: While there are good actors in this film, and I love Rand's stylistic dialogue, the two simply didn't mesh here. Cooper was quite simply a very bad choice for the lead character, and his delivery of Roark's dialogue is all-wrong (note the lack of conviction in his voice during the famed trial speech near the end of the film). Neal is a very good choice for Dominique Francon, but her character isn't given sufficient time to be established, and rather than conveying the passionate pessimism of the novel's character, she comes off merely as crazed and impulsive. Robert Douglas is completely miscast as Ellsworth Toohey. Kent Smith might have made for a good Keating, but his character is also never given room to breathe. Raymond Massey was great as Wynand, however, and he is one of the few bright points in this production.

2) Relative Brevity: The Fountainhead was an enormous book, and I mean this in more than just girth. As one of the great ""novels of ideas"" of the last century, the book deserved a production large enough to do justice to its complex ideas and dramatic intensity. This, however, is impossible, due to the short length of the film. Significant portions of necessary plot are cut out, giving this film a jerky and undramatic feel. The worst of the cuts is what amounts to the first 100 pages of the novel. A short and entirely unsatisfactory montage covers the long period of time between the beginning of the novel, where Howard Roark is expelled from a university, to the death of a major character. All of this information is given to the bewildered viewer in about two minutes, after which the film carries on adapting scenes from the book which, divorced from their dramatic context, become either disappointing or confusing, depending on whether you have read the novel or not.

3) The Involvement of Ayn Rand in the Production: I know I listed this as a potential plus earlier in the review, and it probably would have been, had the author been anyone other than Ayn Rand. This woman, while brilliant and creative, was also something of a control-freak, and, evidently, stubborn to a fault. She pretty much forced the inclusion of material in the film that was inappropriate for the format of the production (a film is not a novel, and what works well in one won't necessarily work well in another). It is telling that the best film adaptation of any of her books (We the Living) was produced in Italy without her knowledge or consent.

Overall, this is a completely disappointing movie that had the potential for greatness. Give it a pass and read the novel.",1262649600,17,3151,4.776146788990825

396146,1,6301969294,"Super star Gary Cooper was one year shy of the half-century mark when he lobbied, and to the horror of many, was awarded one of the most coveted male roles in movie history: Howard Roark. As described in Ayn Rand's still exhilirating masterpiece, The Fountainhead, Roark was a l9/20-year-old brilliant social rebel who battled society to live the way he wanted to and to build buildings the way he designed them. He was a dynamic, feisty, fearless rebel who moved and talked like the genius he was.

The book starts off with Roark being kicked out of college because he refused to compromise his dreams of becoming not a good architect, but a great one.

When Warner Brothers announced it had brought the movie rights to Ayn Rand's landmark novel, many in the film colony saw the Howard Roark part as a shoo-in for rebel-in-residence John Garfield. Charismatic, intense, gorgeous, a brillant artist, he had already created a niche in movies with his bad boy, smart, edgy roles,like the one in the Joan Crawford hit, ""Humoresque"" where he proved unforgettable as the troubled, snarling master violinist, Paul Boray.

Cooper's image in private and on screen was that of a laconic, good-natured boy-next-door who might have parked his horse outside. Very rarely did he move or talk fast and his style was slow-moving and sleepy. In his role of Howard Roark he looks like the grandfather of the young rebel. Probably one of the most excruitiating scenes on film is Roark's big courtroom speech. Cooper resembles an old man, or an ageing cowpoke,whose wandered onto the wrong set, reading text off a teleprompter and at times his eyes bug out at some of the really high tone philosophy that author Ayn Rand wrote.

Cooper was later to say that he understood nothing aboutt the script or his role.  Director King Vidor was later to write that he was appalled by the casting because equally badly cast was Patricia Neal in the juicy role of Roark's love interest--icy, brilliant, surreal Dominique Francon. Neal was a pretty, fresh-faced ingenue who photographed well.

Again, many in the film colony thought Ida Lupino was the perfect actress for the role. She was considered the ""poor man's Bette Davis"" and had turned in extraordinary performances in ""They Drive By Night"" and ""The Hard Way."" Rand said she wrote the Dominique Francon character and later the Dagney Taggart personae in ""Atlas Shrugged"" with Greta Garbo in mind. But Garbo had already quit movies. Barbara Stanwyck was so obsessed with starring in The Fountainhead that she gave studio mogul, Jack Warner a copy of the book with a note saying she ""was born"" to play Dominique Francon.

Cooper can't be entirely faulted for his fatal miscasting. Ayn Rand actually pushed for him to be cast. This was an era when the tiny circle of super stars truly believed their own immortality. Stars like Cooper were brainwashed to think ""their fans"" would love them in any role. Because the Howard Roark role was considered ""hot,"" every male star lobbied for it. Cooper probably was elated and thrilled to have snatched this prize from under the noses of his cohorts. Unfortunately, his hideous mistake and all of those who supported his casting will live forever on DVD and Turner Classic Movies.",1247011200,22,3246,4.88021778584392

396169,5,6301969294,"Fountainhead, the 1949 movie, is based on the 1943 novel by Ayn Rand. The theme of individualism as the key to man's progress is made in the historical setting of the twenties and thirties when collectivism (what we may now call socialism) appeared to be threatening individualism.

Though the setting is now a bit dated, the theme of individualism and the right to express it versus compromise of principle to please an unappreciative public and reap more immediate financial reward will still resonate with many today.

The book itself was an example of the theme of uncompromising individualism.  It had difficulties being published and when it was, it was not well advertised. It did not appeal to the masses. It became popular by word of mouth through networks of people who were able to appreciate its themes.  The book's manner of success mirrors the success of the work of the book's hero, Howard Roarke, an architect, whose work was also recognized by those with the intellectual understanding to appreciate it.

But the film is a compromise of these principles.  A quick glimpse of the cover demonstrates that the movie was marketed as a romance.  Many of the more graphical sexual encounters in the book are toned down.  A rape becomes a kiss.  A marriage that ends in a divorce becomes an engagement that is broken.  Discussions of atheism are deleted. Reference to a 'temple to humanity' is eliminated and its role in the plot is combined into another building.

For the absolute individualist, as was the hero of the book, such compromises by the author, who also wrote the screenplay, seems out of character.  The book's hero speaks of the integrity of a building and describes how building facades designed to appeal to the public are a compromise to a buiding's integrity.  One can make the same case with respect to a book and this film.  We might ask if the book's integrity was compromised in the facades that were incorporated into the movie that allowed it to become more acceptable to the viewing public.

Yet, for those who haven't read the book, who are not aware of these compromises of integrity, the themes of individualism, work for the sake of work with uncompromising quality and integrity, and the mediocrity that results from collectivism, will still be communicated.

In the movie, Patricia Neal does an excellent job as Dominique, the heroine, who understands the themes of quality and individualism.  Dominique is so pained by the inability of the masses to see these qualilties that she purposefully puts herself into situations to avoid contact with the people who exhibit these admirable qualities.  She does so because she does not want to see the persons and their work hurt by the unseeing and inappreciative masses.

The quality people she tries to avoid also include the hero, an architect, Howard Roarke, played by Gary Cooper in the movie.  A complicated love triangle ensues between Roarke, Dominique, and Wynand, a newspaper editor who can see the truth but makes his living by marketing Enquirer type journalism to the masses. Though romance is involved, it is a subordinate theme of the individual (uncompromising quality and integrity) versus the collective (mediocrity and mass misery).

Gary Cooper plays the brilliant and uncompromising individualist and artistic architect, Howard Roarke.  Cooper is less convincing in his role than is Patricia Neal as Dominique.  But Cooper, like Patricia Neal, was a big name star at the time and certainly helped ticket sales for the movie.

Overall the movie is an example of what the book appears to declare to be wrong with the world. It is a product of the collective. In this case that collective includes the movie producers in addition to the individual author and screenwriter. The movie compromises the integrity of the original book so that the movie can be more markettable to the masses. This is evident in its marketting, skipping over more controversial social topics, and using a condensed plot to maintain the focus of an audience expected to have a limited attention span.

If Ayn Rand had the integrity of her character, Howard Roarke, she would have planted explosives in the movie studio production lab and destroyed the original master film.

For those who are a fan of the book, I still suggest viewing the movie, but with caution. One must be willing to compromise the individual efforts of Ayn Rand with the collective influence of the movie industry in order to view this movie.

For those who have not read the book, the movie is still a good watch and still engages the questions of individualism and collectivism.  I suspect that those who find personal resonance with the themes in the movie will also want to read the book.  If the movie viewer does read the book, then the movie did some good, and may have redeemed itself.",1243468800,2,4846,4.911656441717791
396170,1,6301969294,"Wow, this movie was so, so very campy.  Too think that dialogue this bad actually exists is truly amazing.  It only makes you wonder what people ever saw in Ayn Rand in the first place.  I guess those were much simpler times.  I mean, compare the objectivism of Ayn Rand with a philosopher of today like Eckart Tolle.  It's like comparing black and white to color.  It is nice to know that we have evolved in our notions and beliefs over the past 60 years.  Now back to the movie.  Gary Cooper walks through this movie like he's a zombie.  Patricia Neal over acts as Dominic so badly it's painful.  The other characters are so over the top, omg. The music score by Max Steiner famous for Gone with the Wind is pretty good however.

The heavy hand of novelist Ayn Rand's script is evident throughout.  Fortunately, the theme of the story, a man's uncompromising individuality, more than makes up for the film's shortcomings.  Throughout her life, Ayn, (pronounced eye-ann), Rand, influenced by her childhood experiences in communist Russia, campaigned for the rights of the individual over the collective.  Her novel ""The Fountainhead"" was her crowning achievement in this direction.  Although her ideas did not translate into film as well as they might have, her message comes through loud and clear.

Both Gary Cooper(very attractive but too old for playing Roark) and Patricia Neal are very good actors and you can feel how uncomfortable they are doing their best and trying to stay serious and sincere while saying the most ridiculous lines of dialogue ever committed to celluloid. When the dramatic and moving (supposedly) scenes make me giggle uncomfortably and feel sorry for the actors on the screen  I believe it was a bad movie.

First there's the fact that no one seems to smile in the whole film.  Indulge me for a moment while I mention that I find this over-seriousness a recurring problem in Ayn Rand's work.  It's a shame she never learned to lighten up a bit (or to appreciate the merits of well-placed charity, but I digress).

The second problem, which is hardly the fault of the movie, is that the modern style of architecture that seemed so cutting edge at the time has now been done to death -- to the point that the wonderful buildings that are supposed to be driving the story tend to leave the viewer wistful for classicism.

The third problem (WARNING - PLOT SPOILER) is that blowing up a building has a different flavor to it in these post-9/11 days than it did earlier.

396233,3,6301969294,"I had never heard of Ayn Rand before last summer. Somehow she had slipped through. Upon recommendation I read ""The Fountainhead"" while traveling. Now home, I watched the 1949 film adaptation last night. I have admittedly never read anything else by Rand. But with ""The Fountainhead"", both as a novel and as a film, I have a very conflicted relationship. I will refer to both the novel and the movie as basically being one in the same. The film for me, and I suppose this is a criticism, was basically a recap of the book. The novel is written in such a way that from the start it reminded me of a Hollywood studio picture, and as the film proves the jump from the page to the screen was not a long one. Sure the film cuts out a good half of the material in the novel, but that which remains stays true to Rand's general style and her ideas are put across with no loss in complexity or meaning. That too was a criticism. And with the film, just as with the novel, I had the same conflicting urge to both marvel at its bravado and, at the same time, to throw the whole thing out the window.

 Ayn Rand is a terrible writer. And the filmmakers behind this movie were no masters themselves. I found it amusing that ""The Fountainhead"", a story about restless individualism and groundbreaking originality, should be made by a group of such un-notable studio yes-men. I also found it appropriate. Ayn Rand, as a writer of fiction, did not seem to have an original bone in her body, and neither do these filmmakers. It is a 1940s studio film of only the most standard quality. Sure it may have been a bit more ruggedly sexual and pseudo intellectual then its contemporaries, but in regards to both content and especially form the movie is distinctively average. The camera does nothing of note, and neither do the actors really, then again Rand's characters are so astoundingly static and one-dimensional, in both novel and film, that it would have been a near Howard Roarkian feat to bring any life to them. The only actor I thought particularly well suited for his role was Gary Cooper who was finally given a character as bland as his own style of acting. I'm sure there are lots of diehard Cooper fans out there. I am not one of them. But if we are to praise a film for accurate adaptation then there are certainly triumphs to be had. The film is as pedantic and clichd as the novel. The characters are as insultingly unrealistic as they are in the novel (Roark, D. Francon) and given just as little chance for redemption if flawed (Keating, Wynand). And Ayn Rand's philosophy of objectivism is both as intriguing and at the same time annoyingly frustrating as it is in the novel.

 So now that I've had a bit of a rant about how, in terms of form, just how bad ""The Fountainhead"" is, let me now address my conflicted relationship with its content. As bad as ""The Fountainhead"" is both as a film and a novel, I would say that few things I have either read or seen in recent history have had a greater impact on me or have stuck with me as persistently as this work. This is a compliment. Ayn Rand may have been on to something. Her views on originality and self-determinism do hold merit with me and I have often found myself thinking of Howard Roark when trying to find direction in my own life or when attempting to figure out what to do next. I like her description of selfishness, I think her views on genius and individuality are often healthy and inspiring. Unfortunately I also think that they are often the cause of most of the world's troubles, namely wars and industrialism. George W. Bush possesses perhaps a little too much of the Roarkian spirit. Her views are also often unfortunately simplistic and occasionally near infantile. Most people are not geniuses. Most people are unsure of what they want out of life. Most people, geniuses included I feel, have doubts, fears, pressures, insecurities, and, yes, even an unfortunate consideration of what other people think of them. This is healthy. It is part of being human. It is also an essential ingredient of great art. Ayn Rand believes that we should have an ideal to strive for, and that with Roark she has provided one, but she has made it so dogmatic, so beyond the grasp of any real person, that I fear little more then disappointment and loneliness would lie in wait for anyone who dared to reach for it. Her biggest failure to me as a writer is her apparent blindness to the ways society and humans as individuals actually behave and operate and her insistence on presenting her readers and viewers with her own completely unrealistic and climate controlled universe, the only universe where an actual rendering of her ideals would be possible. Maybe I am just one of the `second handers' or `parasites' she so flippantly condemns and therefore cannot see the heights to which man can aspire, but, if so, I feel that I am not alone, that in fact there may be no alternative.

 The ultimate frustration for me, and the proof of the unrealistic heights of her ideals, is again the poor quality of the work. She insisted, in a Roarkian manner, that no changes be made to her script for the film. She obviously felt that, like Roark's buildings, her ideas were her own, most likely brilliant and groundbreaking, and that no opinion or touch of the public should be thrust upon them. Good for her. That's all well and good, and maybe her example should be followed, but I find it ironic and disheartening that a writer so in praise of originality, so quick to triumph that which paves new ground for humanity, should present her ideas in such a pedantic and uninspired manner. Either Ayn Rand was a failure from the start or we now live in a world, some seventy years later, so oversaturated with every possible form and manner of `artistic expression' that originality is no longer possible. I have trouble believing this and instead feel that Ayn Rand is a hack, not because she is so original and so beyond my grasp that I, like Roark's public, cannot come to terms with her brilliance but because she, as a writer, cannot come to terms with everything that surrounds her little self-made, ideal bubble. The world and the people that inhabit it are not that bad. Concepts of community and society, as groups of people, are not inherently negative. Perhaps Ayn Rand could not see that. ""The Fountainhead"" is a second-rate adaptation of a second-rate novel by a second-rate writer/intellectual who had the basic notions of some possibly first-rate ideals, ideals she herself proved to be unobtainable. I have, so far, a very conflicted and ever evolving relationship with Ayn Rand.",1201132800,9,6645,4.598650927487353

396236,4,6301969294,"Since David O. Selznick (producer of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Rebecca"") didn't produce this as a faithful adaptation of the novel, but Henry Blanke (""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"") DID, I recommend seeing the movie first. When you read the novel first, you cast it, design sets and play it out in your mind, and in my mind, Howard Roark is played by Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman is Dominique, and Orson Welles plays a thinly-veiled Charles Foster Kane, aka Gail Wynand. Screenplay by Charles Brackett and Ben Hecht, directed by Howard Hawks, Technicolor, music by Bernard Herrmann.
Anyways, since that's all in my mind's eye, let us deal with what's really there:

This film is the greatest example of post-German expressionism after World War II. Visually, it's overflowing with licht und schatten worthy of Lang and Murnau. This is the movie's greatest achievement, deftly accomplished by cinematographer Robert Burks, who confines Gary Cooper (the movie's martyred saint) in a shadow-world so oppressing, that it rivals Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and Hitchcock's ""I Confess"" (for which Burks was also DP, as he was on all Hitch's films from the early 1950s through Marnie, in 1964, with the exception of ""Psycho"") for the sense of loneliness and psychological isolation which crowd in the hero.

Burks owes a lot to ""Citizen Kane"" in the use of low-camera-angles employed in projecting the movie's tragic hero, Gail Wynand, played by Raymond Massey. Massey brings a British-Canadian flair to the role that is completely outrageous and incongruous with the role's Hell's Kitchen origins. So what! As with Cary Grant, Massey succeeds in the ""willing-suspension-of-disbelief"" department when it comes to ignoring his British accent.

Burks' camera lingers longingly and tenderly on screen siren Patricia Neal, as Dominique. This is when REAL HOT WOMEN got Hollywood roles, and when the likes of Marilyn Monroe ""replaced"" Jane Russell and Kim Novak was groomed as the next Rita Hayworth. The scene in which Neal visits Coop's apartment with the none-too-subtle white fur bust ornament above her evening gown is priceless in the glamor department. A few reviewers call this movie ""dated."" If by dated, they mean not having untalented, unalluring and underfed matchsticks like Gwyneth Paltrow and Calista Flockheart, then, yes, ""The Fountainhead"" is dated.

Britisher Robert Douglas plays Ellsworth Toohey, the rabble-rousing colmunist with over-the-top and villainous aplomb. Wielding his ever-present cigarette holder with blatant swishiness designed to circumvent the Hayes' office censors, Douglas gives the best flamboyant-homosexual-villian performance this side of Robert Walker, as the tortured Bruno in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train.""

Rounding out this bombastic Expressionist tour-de-force is Max Steiner's equally plush and bombastic Romantic score, which uses heavy brass and low strings to provide an aural sledgehammer that sets the action onscreen to the passionate sturm und drang of Tristan und Isolde. They don't make movie music like this anymore. Composer David Raksin (""Laura"") once quipped that 1940s movie music overwhelmed the listener not only with foreboding, but with ""fifthboding.""

Again, compare Steiner's ""maximalism"" (no pun intended) with the oat-bran sparseness of today's so-called composers such as Philip Glass (minimalist is too big a word to describe his simplistic, monotonous, scratchings) and Michael Nyman.

""The Fountainhead"" is a movie made about giants, by giants. Reality be damned, this movie is worthy of ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Metropolis"" and ""Double Indemnity.""

Now, once you've seen the movie, then read the book, which is even better! Do it the other way around, and you'll find yourself ""what-if""ing the Fountainhead that could've been, rather than basking in this sterling example of 1940s cinema.",1196812800,5,3853,5.48566610455312

396260,4,6301969294,"This has to be, by any measure, one of the most bizarre films ever made based, of course, upon one of the dottiest books!  With the character of Howard Roark, Rand personified her own unique `objectivist' philosophy and Vidor put it on the screen in the form of Gary Cooper who enunciates his lines even more robotically than usual rather as if he can't quite believe what he is being required to say!  The script, penned by Rand herself, requires that almost every character deliver their lines as if each were their last and most heroic utterance!  The symbolism, too, is hardly subtle.  For example, in one scene the heroine, Dominique Francon, played by Patricia Neal, beautiful but hard, frigid and sanctimonious, first encounters Roark while he chooses to work as a day labourer in her father's quarry rather than prostitute his architectural `genius' in the pursuit of wealth and wordly acclaim.  She stands looking down on this `tall, gaunt' man piercing the hard, rigid rock faade with a large drill that he holds tightly as if it were an extension of his arm.  Naturally, the rock crumbles under the force of this penetration! We then see her later, obsessed by this image, breaking the marble fireplace in her bedroom as a pretext to get Roark to come to her.  Needless, to say the course of this true love just wasn't meant to run smoothly and Roark deserts Dominique in order to return to New York in response to a request from a wealthy, and obviously discerning, patron to design and build an apartment block.  It is here, on the opening night of the controversial building, that the two are temporarily reunited.

The other central character Gail Wynand, who employs Dominique as a columnist on his paper `The Banner' - a kind of 1940's The Sun - shares many of Roark's characteristics although, ironically, his immense wealth is based upon pandering to the needs of the masses rather than standing alone as Roark chooses to do.  It is Roark's integrity that ultimately wins Wynand, played by Raymond Massey, over and the two men, recognizing a mutual kinship, become almost inseparable friends, much to the vexation and bewilderment of Dominique who, by now, is Wynand's wife.  Thus there ensues a curious, almost, troilistic relationship in which the female plays the role of  the observer.  In this respect Roark's treatment of Dominique might be viewed as somewhat sadistic.

Ultimately it is the patent absurdity of the script and the `heroic' style of acting that combine to produce a deliciously weird and compelling concoction that, because of these very qualities, one never tires of viewing.",1194393600,5,2617,4.891402714932127

I came out in the wake of what some perceived as the excesses of the New Deal and may have been a refreshing challenge to the accepted norms.  Watching the film I can't help to think that it anticapated the philosophy of Barry Goldwater.  Personally, I came of age under Ronald Reagan which I found to be a more satisfying compromise.  That is to say the rights of the individual are respected but informed by Judeo-Christian values.  Rand's uncompromising philosophy does not seem to be informed by a godliness.  That's where I differ with in that I think one can be true to oneself withouting eschewing altruism.  In a nutshell I respect this film without accepting all of the tenets it espouses.  This had to be a difficult film to make because of it's philosophical nature.  Director King Vidor pulls it off brilliantly working from a script by Rand and some stunning visual work.  The entire cast is terrific with a towering performance by Gary Cooper as Rand's everyman(Superman?).  Some would dismiss this film because of it's philosophy.  I think one has to take a page from Howard Roark and agree to disagree but respect the right of the individual to express themself.",1186272000,8,1338,4.7155172413793105
396266,4,6301969294,"What a movie!

This one transcends most over-the-top potboilers of its -- or any -- era.  In some circles, it's a near-classic film.  What we have is the story of Howard Roark, a man of principle who cannot get work as an architect because he will not compromise his skills by conforming to meet only what has been done before.  He will not allow his work to become a committee project.

Patricia Neal is Dominique Francon, a spoiled woman who is determined she will never love anyone because no one will ever be worthy of her love, a love that only a man of principle could aspire to.  Since, in her experience, there are no such men, she is determined to be cold-hearted and removed.

One day, though, she sees Howard Roark in a granite quarry.  Her attraction to him, it seems, is purely animal magnetism.  She storms and stews.  She frantically paces in her bedroom.  She seethes with unbridled angst and determination. In an act of lustful desperation, she smashes a beautiful marble hearth in order to get Roark into her bedroom in order to make a connection with him.

He measures the hearth and orders the marble.  When the marble arrives, he sends a mason to install it.  Dominique takes this as an act of indifference on Roark's part, and it infuriates her. She chases him down and whacks him across the face with a riding crop.

The rest must be seen to be believed.

Raymond Massey is very good as the editor of The Banner, the newspaper that tries to destroy everything that is good and noble, etc.,etc.,etc.

It has one of the most glorious Max Steiner scores EVER.

This is one of those movies that goes on and on, and, yet, there is NEVER A DULL MOMENT.

I don't recall the novel of ""The Fountainhead"" being this brassy and -- for lack of a more-appropriate word -- trashy.

Thus, I can highly recommend ""The Fountainhead"" as both a novel and as a movie, both of which exist independent of the other...with the movie getting the 'you'd never imagine this in a million years' award for its adaptation, especially given that it's Ayn Rand, herself, who scripted the film.

This is one hell of a movie that everyone ought to see!",1184803200,7,2142,4.526041666666667

Whereas the twentieth-century's most severe defender of a singular concept of self-interest and personal expression probably saw in her work a manifesto for the salvation of the creative caste in humanity's mostly wasted population, I liked The Fountainhead for the strength of its visual effects. If this means I ""didn't get it"" then so be it.

This is an impressive movie with sound performances filled with anger, arrogance, megalomania, and an intentional stoical woodenness that was extreme even for Gary Cooper. I liked the shots of buildings worked into existing cityscapes, and the trouble the makers of this motion picture went to to bring Rand's visions to the screen. What I didn't feel was a lot of affinity for Rand's message or for the occasional melodrama that was exhibited by nearly all. This production was often like Citizen Kane meets Brave New World. Some of my friends say Ayn Rand is the greatest writer and visionary the planet has ever produced. I am less generous in my evaluation of her, but I still don't hesitate to say this is a good movie, worth seeing, in no way a waste of time, just not the classic I was led to expect it would be.",1183680000,5,1354,4.689075630252101

It is a fairy tale that only those who choose to ""play the victim"" (of society) would find appealing.

In spite of all that (actually, mostly *because* of it) I give it three stars.  It does have 1) great production value, 2) quite a bit of laugh-out-loud unintentional burlesque and 3) instills a total amazement that anyone could ever take this remotely seriously even as a metaphor or morality play.

It is in fact, Le Thtre de l'Absurde which, if intentional would have done Camus proud.  I shudder to think that Rand's outlook on life in society was truly as vacuous as is suggested by this movie.  But she wrote the screenplay, and apparently had *complete control* so it's not like one can blame someone else for its shallow idealisms.

The drill scene comes to mind. I do think that scene itself should merit a PG rating. Can you imagine, trying to answer a childs question such as, ""Mommy, why is the woman looking at the man with the drill like that?"" It does have several flaws which prevents me from giving it 5 stars such as Coop's speech at the end. Cooper himself thought it should have been reshot because he was rather stilted in his delivery of it.  This, I do not blame on Cooper as, it seems to me, that any good director or producer should have realized that the scene needed some more work.  All in all, Cooper was a great actor in the Naturalistic Manner.

  Eveything about this movie is way over the top.  It was meant to be that way.  But you know what? It also makes you think.  I can count on one hand, the movies that make you think and to me that gives it more merit than most movies made in the last 40 years.

  To the critics who dislike the movie because it is unrealistic. Do these critics also think movies like Douglas Sirk's Written on the Wind are not any good?

WB deserves alot of credit for even putting such a controversial book to film, but its somewhat undone by a talky script and overage and clueless Gary Cooper in the lead. I love the book and Rand in general, but the screenplay is too slavish to the book, leaving too much to speeches and not enough to action. Some of it is like watching an audio novel. Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey are terrific; Kent Smith is a little too weak as Keating and Ellsworth Toohey comes across as a completely one-dimensional caricature, almost an evil Nazi transplanted from a film five years older.

It is not a forgotten masterpiece, as some have recently claimed, but it is endlessly fascinating. Rand attempts to appropriate Nietzsche (Roark = Nietzschean superman) and place him in an American context. Yet for all its celebration of individual initiative/integrity, and all its attacks on the masses and mob mentality, the film seems to want us to SUBMIT to the charisma and force of the male protagonist. How is this not unlike what the National Socialists attempted by claiming Nietzsche as a precursor to fascist ideology? Note, in particular, the final shot and its jaw-dropping symbolism: Roark astride the world's tallest skyscraper as the camera (simulating the POV of Dominique) slowly makes its ways towards his outstretched legs?

396351,4,6301969294,"There is no getting around the fact that this 1949 movie is great fun, and a pristine print is finally available on DVD from Warner Home Video. It should come as no surprise that the film is so faithful to Ayn Rand's eminently readable, marathon 1943 novel since Rand wrote the screenplay herself and in true individualistic fashion, demanded that not a word of it be changed during the filming. Consequently, every scene is full of dialogue with her cerebral polemics, sometimes heavy-handed but often sharply clever, much of it highlighting her philosophy of objectivism. She has the ideal partner-in-crime in director King Vidor, who brings his trademark melodramatic flourishes to a feverish pitch here. The result is often laughable for its excesses but irresistible for the Baroque style Vidor fluidly instills with every preposterous story turn.

At the core of the time-spanning plot is Howard Roark, a supremely talented, uncompromising architect whose ego reigns supreme and whose selfishness ultimately marks him as a true success in his field. Interestingly, while Roark's designs bear a deliberate resemblance to Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie style, they more importantly retain a timeless, contemporary feel. His philosophical adversary is Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic for the New York Banner, a pompous elitist who values mediocrity as a means to subdue the masses. In between Roark and Toohey is the Banner's owner, tycoon Gail Wynand, whose successful climb out of his Hell's Kitchen background has given him unprecedented power to influence the masses. While he is Toohey's boss, Wynand gradually comes to admire Roark's talent and individualism.

Complicating matters considerably is Dominique Francon, the headstrong daughter of a successful architect, whose primal attraction to Roark is mixed with self-loathing over what she envisions as his doomed visions. Roark's polar opposite can be found in his former classmate and rival architect Peter Keating, a man devoid of ideals and more than willing to accommodate the masses to ensure his livelihood. Their various interactions eventually lead to a melodramatic climax which has Roark secretly designing an expansive low-income housing project only to see it bastardized in construction. His fate hangs in the balance as he cannot reconcile the compromise made to his vision.

While obviously too old in the early scenes, Gary Cooper is able to tap into Roark's darker side while dexterously maintaining his heroic standing. In quite a contrast to the amiable speech he gives in the climax of Frank Capra's ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", he delivers the particularly lengthy, verbose courtroom speech with conviction. In only her second film, a 22-year old Patricia Neal is certainly a sizzling, glamorous presence as Dominique, and she makes the most of her rather impossible role even though Vidor seems to be encouraging her to go overboard frequently. Nowhere is this more evident than the hilariously over-the-top first encounters between Roark and Dominique when she thinks he is a lowly, testosterone-charged quarry worker (with one big gyrating drill!)

As Wynand, Raymond Massey is able to lend surprising humanism to a man who finds in Roark his one opportunity to take a heroic stand. Robert Douglas overdoes Toohey's effete manner, but he does become the villain you love to hate. The weak link in the cast is Kent Smith as the simpering Keating, melting way too easily in the background. Adding immeasurably to the film's Baroque dimensions are the crescendo-filled music of the legendary Max Steiner, the deep shadows pervasive in Robert Burks' masterful cinematography, and the almost expressionistic sets by Edward Carrere and William L. Kuehl (note how ludicrously huge Wynand's office is). With no accompanying commentary track, the 2006 DVD contains just two extras - the original theatrical trailer and a strictly by-the-numbers short, just eighteen minutes, on the making of the film.",1163030400,22,3984,5.349282296650718
396352,5,6301969294,"I like all things about architecture anyway and this movie is so much more than just cold steel of buildings.  Yes it is a LOVE Story but it is more than that as well.  This movie shows it is not easy living with the ugly politics that make it painful to be a visionary genius advocating designs and concepts far ahead of their time.  Money focuses most intently on what worked in the past so anyone daring to look too far into the future is seen as a distablizing influence.  In the Monied world the idict is conform or die and be quick about it, and The Fountainhead is a movie about that lone awesome magical individual who goes against the conventional wisdoms of his time to champion new ideas that currently have no high powered corporate backers.

I like The Fountainhead because, it shows that firm unwavering commitment to one's core ideals matters amd matters most when few of the current in crowd have the guts to stand with you.  The Fountainhead shows how far too many people let themselves be led like mindless sheep by a media, ""that thinks it alone knows whats best for society.  The Fountainhead shows how too many people are content to live blind, bland uninspired lives steeped in a purposefully ignorance that in time saps their creative souls.  The Fountainhead is as much about art as it is a movie about architecture, The Fountainhead is more than a movie about love between a man and a woman, the The Fountainhead speaks to the human heart of man and why he creates.  True creativity like the human can not be constrained, corporate blinders are inconsistant with what any visionary person see's be they inventor, accountant or architect.

I love this movie because, it embraces and celebrates the human hearts need for creativity to live at its fullest potential.  Is the movie perfect NOPE, but for what it is The Fountainhead is awesome.  I have been wishing and hoping the Fountainhead would come out on DVD.  I have the VHS version and I wear it out watching it.  Of course I will be buying the DVD of The Fountainhead and hope you treat yourself to a copy as well.  Watch The Fountainhead then go out and create something awesome that changes the world for the better!  Hey a old wolf dude can dream can't he!

Roark is a scion of modern architecture, steadfastly rejecting the accepted classical concepts in his field.  His stubborn approach initially leaves him penniless and without clients forcing him to work in a Connecticut stone quarry.

While toiling in that rockpile, he meets Dominique Francon played by the comely Patricia Neal, a wealthy socialite and daughter of one of New York's foremost architects.  The frigidly emotionless Neal works as a columnist for a large tabloid, The Banner whose owner is wealthy newspaper magnate Gale Wynand played by Raymond Massey.  So begins the interplay between these three main characters.

Cooper eventually gains fame and fortune designing and constructing a controversial housing project that is lampooned by The Banner with the approval of Massey.  Massey's henchman, architectural columnist Ellsworth Toohey played by Robert Douglas, jealous of Cooper's creative genius, proceeds to excoriate his every effort.

Neal and Cooper fall in love but realize they can't be together and she eventually marries Massey. The wealthy Massey recognizing the genius of Roark bestows many choice projects on him and lives his life vicariously through Cooper's spirit.  In Massey's rise to the top he has lost his individuality, always catering to the masses.

Cooper becomes enticed to design a massive housing project using a schooltime crony of his and Neal's father's partner the soft and venal Peter Keating played by Kent Smith as his front.  When the clients decide to alter his plans without first consulting him, denying him control of the project, the steadfast Cooper decides to take matters into his own hands.  His actions result in a court case, in which Massey is forced to take an unpopular stand.

396357,5,6301969294,"Regardless of whether you've read the Ayn Rand book by the same name, you can easily follow and enjoy FOUNTAINHEAD.

A black and white 1949 film that on the surface is about a modern architect, a newspaper writer/socialite and their tortured love for each other, FOUNTAINHEAD is actually a dramatization of Rand's controversial objectivist philosophy that promotes individual rights.

That, however, is not what makes this a highly recommended film.  What makes FOUNTAINHEAD great are the overly dramatic film noirish scenes where ice princess and newspaper gal about town, Dominique Francon (played by Patricia Neal) rattles off long monologues that leave the viewer and innovative architect Howard Rourke (played by Gary Cooper) charmed.

Plus the film is just gorgeous.  The scenes and locations are indescribably beautiful, particularly the party celebrating the opening of the Enwright House.  That is one breath-takingly stunning apartment and yet all the stylish people floating through it have looks of horror on their faces.  ""It just isn't homey,"" one snobby lady notes as she searches for the neoclassical embellishments she's more familiar with.

Perhaps my favorite character is Gale Wynand, Dominique's husband and the owner of the Banner, the city's scandal-obsessed tabloid newspaper.  A self made man, Gale hires Rourke to build a country home as a testament to his love for icy, idealist wife.  No matter how many times I see this film I will never grow tired of the monologue Wynand offers to explain the ""unspeakable struggle"" that brought him from destitute poverty growing up in New York's Hell's Kitchen to fabulous wealth.

Two other characters are worth noting here.  One is Ellsworth Toohey, the power-obsessed architecture columnist, who uses his pulpit to control and manipulate public opinions and the minds of weak architects like Peter Keating.  An architecture school contemporary of Howard Rourke, Keating is Rourke's polar opposite philosophically.  A follower, who will literally build anything someone will pay for, Keating lacks the soul and vision that makes Rourke such a compelling masculine ideal.

I could go on and on writing about this fantastic film but I will restrain myself.  Still I will say if you like the 1940s, film noir, gorgeous design, lady-like clothing and the good old days when men were men and women were stylish, prim and complicated, rent the FOUNTAINHEAD.  It's a gem.

If you get disturbed when films do not follow precisely the books they are based on, this will could drive you crazy.

Of course you can't expect the entire novel to be converted into a movie. That's almost never done, and for a good reason. And there were a lot of elements from the book that couldn't make it into the movies in 1949, like the Peter Keating-Dominique Francon divorce, her rape at the hands of Roarke, nude statues, etc.

But other scenes were converted quite nicely, especially the fireplace scene, where the nature of marble is described. Another excellent scene is the courtroom, where Roarke makes his defense, and praise of individuality and excellence.

1) Ayn Rand's heavy handed screen play.
2) Wooden Acting by Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey.
3) A great imitation of Vladimir Lenin in the Ellsworth Toohey character played by actor Robert Douglas.
4)  Patrica Neal as Ice Princess.  Anytime she comes on the screen you will be singing the old Foreigner tune ""She's cold as ice.  She's willing to sacrifice our love.""
5) A film in black and white, and I mean black and white.  Everything in this story is black and white.
6) Gary Cooper's maniacal little grin right before ravishing the Dominique Francon character played by Patricia Neal.  He even has the grin when he is thinking about ravishing, and possibly raping by the look on the character Howard Roork's face, Dominique.
7) Dominque's husband, Gail Wynand played by Raymond Massey,  pronouncing her name Dominic.  (A little homoeroticism going on here?)
8) Straight lines and lots of them.
9) At the end of the movie a giant phallic symbol looking of a skyscraper and Patricia Neal almost in orgasm as she rides up the construction elevator to meet her new sex partner, Gary Cooper.
10)  Finally, you will find out that all that matters in life is Architecture.  (Maybe, Art Vandalay was right?)

The only reason this movie rates 2 stars is that the direction of this film by King Vidor is actually quite good.  And considering he had to work under that harpy, Ayn Rand, he should have gotten a medal for martyrdom.  The screen play and acting rate ZERO stars.  Well maybe a 1/2 star for comic relief.

Until I saw this movie I thought Ayn Rand and Objec! ivists in general had no sense of humor.  And to think some folks believe anything written by Rand is perfection itself.",1128297600,25,1947,4.564841498559078
396391,1,6301969294,"Considering all the talent involved in the making of this movie, one might be amazed at how bad it is, if one didn't consider the source material.  No matter what thinks of Rand as a philospher, very few people ever seriously try to make the case that her novels qualify as great literature.  The characters are one-dimensional, the themes are black & white, and the dialogue is more pontification than anything else.  This does not translate well at all to the big screen.  One is left with a storyline that positively rushes along as though trying to meet a deadline, and characters that make one absurd, extended speech after another.  An already rather hamfisted literary style becomes only more pronounced in the movie version.

It always struck me as a little odd that architecture, of all things, was the medium used to make the Objectivist case concerning artistic integrity and individual expression.  The notion that the people commissioning buildings and houses (which they are paying for, not to mention working & living in) are expected to acquiesce to the whims of the architect is absurd.  What about their right to self-expression?  My wife & I built an addition to our house last year, and if the architect had refused to accept our input because he felt compelled to follow his muse, we would have given him the heave-ho.  Screw you; it's our house and we have muses too.  Rand never fully reconciled this paradox, and in her screenplay she made did not even make a half-hearted effort at it.  Roark's patrons are reduced to cartoons, who want certain architectural features because ""the public demands it.""  Ummmm....what?  I have yet to see mobs taking to the streets because they think buildings are ugly.

To make matters worse, anyone seeing this movie who is not already familiar with Rand's philosophy & the novel will find this movie to be, at best, bizarre.  At worst, they will find it to be horrifyingly self-absorbed in its nature.  No matter how you slice it, it's pretty damned lousy movie-making.",1126396800,31,2029,4.851744186046512
396392,4,6301969294,"One of the hot topics in the field of asthetics is the extent to which a work of art is improved by 'truth' or cheapened by falsity. Does right and wrong, true or false, have any effect at all of the artistic value of a creative work of art. I believe this movie and the novel by Ayn Rand on which it is based is one of the finest case studies for the position that the truth of an artistic work's intellectual message has a profound effect on the artistic value of the work. Virtually the only other cinematic work about which I might say this is Leni Riefenstall's famous documentary, 'Triumph of the Will'.

My point is based on the fact that author Rand takes a reasonable position of artistic integrity and twists it into a form which simply makes no sense when applied to the discipline of architecture. The abberation would disappear, in my mind, if Gary Cooper were a sculptor, poet, painter, or even playwright. If he were Michaelangelo doing the Sistine Chapel ceiling, the issue starts to get really fuzzy, as he is creating a decoration for a specific patron to fill a very specific function.

What makes the wrongheadedness of the character Roarke's individualism so apparant is that it is played out in the world of architecture, where almost all buildings are done for a specific client, which, for commercial buildings, is almost always a corporation with lots of different opinions and needs to satisfy. The simplest case is that of a family with a husband, wife, 2.3 children and a dog looking for a house. You need to balance financial resources against the number of bedrooms, the number of closets, and the fenced in yard for Fido.

If you think this is hard, multiply this by 1000 when it comes to building a mall or a highrise.

The thing which makes this such a good case study of art and reason and right and wrong is the fact that the director, King Vidor and the principle actors, Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey do such a good job with the script, the blocking, and the cinematography. With Massey's character as a newspaper magnate, one is immediately inclined to make comparisons with 'Citizen Kane'.

Unfortunately, the wrongheadedness of Rand's political and personal philosophy seriously compromises the whole film. Oddly, Cooper's character has a remarkable albeit superficial resemblence to Frank Lloyd Wright's career, which I am sure adds much verisimillatude to the story.

But, from what little I know of Wright's career, he was largely successful from the outset and often compromised on major design points.

I recommend this movie as much for its wrongheadedness as for its artistic value.",1126310400,13,2646,4.802197802197802

396394,1,6301969294,"This movie has a basic philosophical point that apparently got a lot of people excited in the 50s, Ayn Rand's simplistic statement that the individual has integrity, but the popular view of 'the mob' is always mediocre.  There isn't much more to it than that, but the author thought it was profound, and so did the makers of this film, which is based on Rand's novel.  I cannot imagine how this single, obvious point could be the basis of a 800 page novel.  As a movie, it's hypnotically bad. Every scene and every character make the same point.  The villains make idiotic speeches about how ""we have to consider public opinion, don't we?"" and the heroes say things like ""I got where I am by acting on my own honest judgement, no matter what anyone else thought.""  Although the cast is filled with great actors, in this film, the acting makes a daytime soap opera seem like the Royal Shakespeare Company.  The director apparently told everyone in the film to stand still and make a speech, preferably in a monotone.  The love affair between the architect Roark (who, in a fit of integrity, becomes a 'common laborer' after a bank board rejects his innovative design) and a fashionably-attired and presumably wealthy columnist who marries an egotistical newspaper publisher, is the most grim-faced romance ever filmed.  Yet his phallic architecture makes her weak kneed and vulnerable. The film pretends that architecture is an issue that a cynical publisher would put on the front page to stir the masses and boost circulation.  Right. Thousands of people will write the paper demanding that all buildings have Greek ornamentation. Uh huh.

396396,4,6301969294,"I saw this movie the other night and I was quite impressed with a number of its' aspects.  What struck me the most was the symbolism.  There was a rather bold bit of sexual symbolism about a fourth of the way into the movie.  There was a scene at a marble quarry with our hero, Howard Roark (Gary Cooper), drilling away into the rock.  This image enraptures Patricia Neal who was watching from above.  She's back the next day with her riding crop (but no horse).  They banter back and forth visually like this culminating in a rather violent climax.  This series of scenes may seem corny to many but it is an example of what movies used to do very effectively; show suggestive material without hitting us over the head with us.  This is just the sort of artistic use of visual symbolism that modern American film directors seem totally unable to utilize.  Modern American film tends to put it all up on the screen for everyone to see.  Very little is left to the imagination with the result that most movies are unfit for juveniles to see.  I'm not sure I know many juveniles that would want to sit through ""The Fountainhead"" but there's nothing in the movie that would give it anything other than a ""G"" rating.  This despite the bold sexual imagery that it displays.

There is a lot of strong acting in the movie which is fitting because the movie is about strong individuals.  The storyline is that society represses the strength and artistic abilities of the individual.  The old adage; ""to get along you have to go along"" works to maintain the status quo.  The person with truly new ideas is chased out of town because society abhors change.  This is the premise at least.  I don't happen to agree with it.  Most of us recognize the moment we get married (if we didn't already know it by then) that compromising for the better good of all is the way that works the best.  Some may say that society has compromised way too much but the world view that ""The Fountainhead"" portrays gets to be a wee bit too totalitarian.  Nonetheless, the movie does an excellent job of portraying an eclectic group of individualists and makes a statement by showing the breaking point of each.  The one survivor is honored by a quite spectacular ending.  This may have been the ultimate in sexual symbolism.",1114473600,18,2292,4.536585365853658

An architect , a free creator of new spaces renounces to give up his ideals,  he even goes far beyond and decides to cross the frontier of the politically correct facing the public opinion .

In those times the phantom of the collective welfare fed the mind of so many people; some of them absolutely convinced and other portion fondled the romantic idea as a possibility: but King Vidor saw with this entry the magnificent opportunity to make his own statement defending the free will and the creative gifts of the individual initiative above any other premise. He had given us that sublime masterpiece The crowd two decades before, to remark this fact. The image of Frank Lloyd Wright is obviously associated when you watch the film carefully. Lloyd Wright is in the supreme pioneer and most ambitious architect of  new paradigms in the arcane tradition of creative spirits and scientist such Edison, for instance.

The speech given by Cooper when he appeals to the great Jury defending his most intimate beliefs, still maintain its actuality and possibly is the highlight of the film. The sequence in which we watch cooper leaving the office of Massey when he is hired to build the new see of the vanished Banner is simply exquisite and reminds once more the shadows of the German expressionism where the shadows of the betrayal and the triumph of the ideals are faced with all the merciless nakedness.

A personal triumph and a serious warning for those who still believe in the collective welfare as an untouchable Credo simply due the man is not redeemable.",1111622400,7,1720,4.896907216494846

396431,2,6301969294,"The adaption of the Fountainhead into film is a futile attempt worstened only by misfit acting. Ayn Rand is noted for presenting characters as they should be and not as they are. Her characters are heroic in a way that can never be imitated nor brought to life by way of acting. Gary Cooper is awful as Howard Roark. His discomfort with the script is clearly evident, he lacks subltelty and the emotion needed for a character of larger than life proportion, let alone depicting a man who defies the world to uphold his values. Patricia Neal is guilty of overt over-acting, she is unworthy of Dominic Francone's character and is impossible to be held in anything other than derision. The Fountainhead should never have been made into a movie it serves only to demean an extroadinary work. The actors are weakened by a dialogue which they can't portray, words that are meant to depict power and intrasigent ideals are delivered in a laughable manner. Personally, I wish I had never seen this movie so that I can forget the mockery it has made of a seminal novel. Not a single actor is worthy of recognition because they can't live up to their larger than life depictions. The cinematography is, however, noteworthy. The sets were created intelligently and artistically. Architecture is given enough emphasis to keep the viewer from ending the movie if only to see the next shot, the next erection (literally as phallic buildings are in constant use) of a premier cantilivered construction endeavouring to emulate the works of Frank Loyd Wright. The purpose of The Fountainhead was to let loose Ayn Rands Objectivist Philosophy and was done brilliantly in the book. The appeal lie in the spirit of her words and thoughts delivered by proxy through characters which are so grandiose, so sublime that no amount of acting could possibly do them justice. Her words are capable of penetrating one's deepest feelings, prompting otherwise static emotions, a revolution in one's mind. Comparably the movie is comedic, prompting those very feelings of pity that Ayn Rand would be ashamed to have her readers feel.",1109203200,9,2101,4.904494382022472

That being said, this is an unforgettable film that may even change your life. Raymond Massey gives a great performance in his usual ""King Cutler"" manner as Gail Wynand the publisher who rose from Hell's Kitchen to become a ""man of the people"". The characters are unrealistic but interesting. Especially Toohey as the villain. The musical score DOMINATES the film. In fact, you will remember the score better than the story. Gary Cooper gives a stiff performance but in consideration that the character is considered odd, his work fits the film. Now everyone knows that it is based on the Philosophy of Ayn Rand and the cult of individualism over collective control. In reflecting those values we get some real and unreal scenes. I can't for the life of me see why there would be protests and riots because ""The Banner"" defends Roark or over the building of ""The Enright House"". What is realistic are insidious and evil individuals trying to sway the public through their own propaganda to agree with them in prosecuting others (in this case Roark, the symbol of ultimate individualism). Rand was a big fan of the legal system as a vindication of truth and uses the vehicle as she did in  ""Penthouse Legend"" again to give this picture a dramatic climax. What was not worthwhile was how she handled the Wynand character, committing suicide because he did not stand up for his principles all the way. You end up feeling sorry for Wynand and the seeming inability to restore the friendship that he has with Roark. When this picture is shown on television, it is CUT to shreds. So much so that one night the first scene was when Dominique Francon is shown throwing the statue of the god out the window!(almost 20 minutes into the picture!) Now of couse we desire an uncut DVD.

No architect I have ever met acted anywhere near as self rightious as Roarke, they'de be working at MickieD's the rest of there lifes, as NO ONE would ever hire them, not even to clean pools. Architecture is about knowing your client needs and providing a solution that meets all the requirements of the client, city, and context. That being said, this movies a HOOT!!!
First off, too all the Rand-ites out there, THIS IS A MOVIE! get over the fact that the book is better, every book is better than the movie, thats the nature of the beast.
For the Non-Rand-ites out there, SEE IT SEE IT SEE IT. This movie is a melodramotic potboiler of bad movie bliss. Dont get me wrong, the production values are excellent, its beautifully shot and the cinematography is terrific. The archtectural projects are really spectacular and completely impossible to build, so they are way over the top. But the script is pure Hooey! and the music is sooooo overly-dramatic. Thats what makes this such a great film too watch. Only Ann Rand could take a good novel and cram it into such a laughably compacted screenplay. I felt I has watching cliffnotes from the novel. In the first 5 minutes a year of the story goes by, and the whole film is like that.
There are some very good moments in the film though, topped by Coopers speech to the jury. But the best sceen is after the ""drills in the quarry"" scene when Patrica Oneill is thinking of Cooper and in the background are images of drills with this completely campy Xylophone music acompanying it. Its one of the most overtly sexual suggestive scenes ever put of film and it hilarious, and don't forget to wait till the end, when you can see the Worlds Greatest 200 story Phallic Symbol ever created on film in the Wymann Building, with Cooper standing on top of course!",1073952000,11,1979,4.515320334261839
396436,5,6301969294,"Is what Howard Roark (Gary Cooper) tells Dominique Francon (Patricia Neal) about her fireplace. They're talking about er...marble.
This is in a scene which occurs shortly after their first encounter, when Dominique spots Roark and his muscular forearm working at a quarry operating a drilling machine into the stone.

After a long and prolongued silence which ranks among the best moments in cinema, she asks, from her height above the pit: ""Why are you looking at me?"" Roark replies: ""For the same reason you're looking at me.""

And if you think that's a good moment, wait till Roark's  climactic speech to the jury.  Over five minutes long. (What!  A movie audience sitting still through a speech? Impossible!) and absolutely spellbinding.

The film version of Ayn Rand's bestselling novel was directed by the expressionist master, King Vidor, and the screenplay written by, of all people, Ayn Rand.

 Who, during a pre-production party  accosted Jack L. Warner and  warned him that if he cheapened or otherwise dumbed down her work, she would  dynamite his studio. She meant it. Jack smiled and gave her a cigar.

The Fountainhead is the story of a hero who wins.
By hero, we mean an uncompromising man of genius and absolute integrity. This seems as far fetched to us as Cyrano fighting a hundred armed swordsmen---and winning! (Rostand was a major influence for Rand ) It's clearly impossible.  He's not in Russia, so he won't be shot, it's not that explicit--it's America, he's bound to quietly fade into obscurity and failure. It would be naive to suppose otherwise, so how  can this be a triumph instead of a tragedy?

Thematically that's the question that Roark's alter egos Gail Wynand (Raymond Massey) and Dominique  Francon ask themselves. Gail is the billionare owner of an ""Enquirer"" type of news rag who rose from poverty by giving the suckers what they wanted. He lives by the credo ""Oppress or be oppressed.""

 Dominique wants to want nothing, the logical credo of a beautiful woman who is convinced that beauty and greatness have no chance at all in this world. We first meet her as she's destroying of a statue of a Greek god.  She's fallen in love with it and can't bear the pain of needing it, or anything else.

As usual with Rand, these are tortured giants, not the ""folks next door""
Critics of Rand are right in stating that they are improbable beings. (Name a great man or woman of history who isn't).

Roark does make Conan the Barbarian look like a wimp by comparison. But you see, that's the fun of it. As are her villains, who are NOT romanticized ( forget ""Bonnie and Clyde"" , ""The Godfather"" and the rest of zillions of  ever so cool bad guys we've been fed by Hollywood for decades) they are chilling parasites, exemplified in the character of Ellsworh Toohey.

I'ts Ayn Rand, people. Teenage girl sexual fantasies out of Danielle Steele combined with the mind of  an Aristotle!  A strange but wonderfull combination.

 And as to Cooper, Neal and Massey, their acting is phenomenal. Perfect casting and flawless directing by Vidor.

396437,5,6301969294,"Ayn Rand's masterpiece novel loses none of its plot and pace in this, somewhat shorter, film production. The theme of the film is: the individual verses the collective. And the individual, in this case played by Gary Cooper in the form of Howard Roark, is brilliantly portrayed through a sense of self-belief, determination and sheer ability. His ideological opposite, Elsworthy Toohey, is also well acted and personifies the evil collectivist who renounces all individual achievements and believes that men should act as their brother's keepers. Then there are in-between characters too - those of mixed premises - such as Gail Wynand and Dominique Francon. All of these dramatic individuals play their part in a compelling and well thought through story.
Perhaps one of the most impressive (although unsurprising given the author) facets of the film is that it actually has an underlying message: it's not merely a concoction of disjointed and pointless scenes. The climax and meaning to the whole story can be found in Roark's own testimony at his court case: his statement and explanation that man exists for his own sake, not for the sake of others.
This is definitely a film for those who believe in the hero of man the creator, though it will, almost certainly, be too close for comfort for the collectivist crowd!",1042416000,15,1321,5.036529680365297

One favourite moment is when Patricia Neal is caught at home during business hours by her employer, Raymond Massey managing editor of The Banner newspaper (cf New York Post),as she drops a white statuette artifact from her 20th floor NY apartment, watching it smash to pieces on the concrete below. When queried by her boss why, she explains she loves the statuette so much, it's so perfect, she has to destroy it because she does not want to be dependent on anything. The sexual imagery is also wonderfully Freudian and rich such as the long moment when Ms Neal as Dominique visits the quarry where Mr Cooper as the uncompromising architect Howard Roark is working as a labourer as he is unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity.  He stands there with the large drill extended in front of him whilst they exchange one of the longest most smoldering looks in cinematic history, her eyes dropping to the drill, the touch of a smirk/smile on his lips.  The finale is a classic Freudian moment, as we watch Ms Neal ascend the tallest phallic symbol in New York and experience the religious/sexual ecstasy of complete fulfilment.  A truly wonderful moment given aural power by the lush music of Max Steiner. All the actors have a field day, but for the great actor Raymond Massey, it may have been one of his greatest performances. Nor should one overlook the brilliance of Robert Douglas as the newspaper's critic, who is worthy of comparison with George Sanders in All About Eve.

396489,3,6301969294,"I was introduced to the work of Ayn Rand through her masterpiece
novel, ""The Fountainhead.""  I think that, whether you agree with
the author's ideas or disagree, the book makes you think about
concepts, and for that reason alone THE BOOK is an all-time
classic.
Seeing the MOVIE after reading the book was a HUGE disappointment
for me.  I think that one main reason for this might be that the
book is an epic, and no movie has the time to explore and
elaborate on the characters as much as the book has.  The
second is that many of the dialogues in the movie are directly
taken from the book.  Within the grand scope of the book, this
is appropriate, but taken out of context, the dialogues seem
awkwardly transplanted.  Rand should have written different
dialogues for a short movie.  This book should have been
remade as a TV series ... that allows for the depth of character
development, which is vital to understanding Rand's ideas.
Having said all that, I'll say that Gary Cooper is the perfect
fit for Howard Roark.  I was disappointed by the limited
expression that was allowed in the movie for Dominique Francon.
Gail Wynand's depiction as the tragic hero is the one that
seemed to me closest to the book, and Ellsworth Toohey in
the movie was hardly what I expected after reading the book.
The Toohey character in the movie is well-built, and a
fairly imposing person.  The Toohey that I gathered from the book
might have been a frail and odd-looking character, much like
Larry King, who achieves his power based on his personality,
wit, intrigue, and sarcasm.
Well, enough talk.  Read the book, you will adore it.  If you've

The weak point is the dialogue which the main characters have to deliver, its disjointed and  brusque quality leaving no scope for any physical expression in order for them not to appear wooden. Howard Roark and Gail Wynand come off very badly due to this failing,

One of the few scenes in which it wasn't a problem is the one in which Howard, Gail, and Dominique are chatting in the grounds of the Wynand's new home prior to going on a yachting trip.  In the book the same problem was apparent, but because here wasn't any actors involved to amplify the issue it didn't draw attention to itself as much as it did in the film -  but not by much.

As far as I could recall, the dialogue was pretty much straight from the book, aside from where scenes had been changed to fit in with the screenplay. And Roark's speech at the end was shorter in comparison to the book's, I thought.

396491,4,6301969294,"Since David O. Selznick (producer of ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Rebecca"") didn't produce this as a faithful adaptation of the novel, but Henry Blanke (""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"") DID, I recommend seeing the movie first. When you read the novel first, you cast it, design sets and play it out in your mind, and in my mind, Howard Roark is played by Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman is Dominique, and Orson Welles plays a thinly-veiled Charles Foster Kane, aka Gail Wynand. Screenplay by Charles Brackett and Ben Hecht, directed by Howard Hawks, Technicolor, music by Bernard Herrmann.
Anyways, since that's all in my mind's eye, let us deal with what's really there:
This film is the greatest example of post-German expressionism after World War II. Visually, it's overflowing with licht und schatten worthy of Lang and Murnau. This is the movie's greatest achievement, deftly accomplished by cinematographer Robert Burks, who confines Gary Cooper (the movie's martyred saint) in a shadow-world so oppressing, that it rivals Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" and Hitchcock's ""I Confess"" (for which Burks was also DP, as he was on all Hitch's films from the early 1950s through Marnie, in 1964, with the exception of ""Psycho"") for the sense of loneliness and psychological isolation which crowd in the hero.
Burks owes a lot to ""Citizen Kane"" in the use of low-camera-angles employed in projecting the movie's tragic hero, Gail Wynand, played by Raymond Massey. Massey brings a British-Canadian flair to the role that is completely outrageous and incongruous with the role's Hell's Kitchen origins. So what! As with Cary Grant, Massey succeeds in the ""willing-suspension-of-disbelief"" department when it comes to ignoring his British accent.
Burks' camera lingers longingly and tenderly on screen siren Patricia Neal, as Dominique. This is when REAL HOT WOMEN got Hollywood roles, and when the likes of Marilyn Monroe ""replaced"" Jane Russell and Kim Novak was groomed as the next Rita Hayworth. The scene in which Neal visits Coop's apartment with the none-too-subtle white fur bust ornament above her evening gown is priceless in the glamor department. A few reviewers call this movie ""dated."" If by dated, they mean not having untalented, unalluring and underfed matchsticks like Gwyneth Paltrow and Calista Flockheart, then, yes, ""The Fountainhead"" is dated.
Britisher Robert Douglas plays Ellsworth Toohey, the rabble-rousing colmunist with over-the-top and villainous aplomb. Wielding his ever-present cigarette holder with blatant swishiness designed to circumvent the Hayes' office censors, Douglas gives the best flamboyant-homosexual-villian performance this side of Robert Walker, as the tortured Bruno in Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train.""
Rounding out this bombastic Expressionist tour-de-force is Max Steiner's equally plush and bombastic Romantic score, which uses heavy brass and low strings to provide an aural sledgehammer that sets the action onscreen to the passionate sturm und drang of Tristan und Isolde. They don't make movie music like this anymore. Composer David Raksin (""Laura"") once quipped that 1940s movie music overwhelmed the listener not only with foreboding, but with ""fifthboding.""
Again, compare Steiner's ""maximalism"" (no pun intended) with the oat-bran sparseness of today's so-called composers such as Philip Glass (minimalist is too big a word to describe his simplistic, monotonous, scratchings) and Michael Nyman.
""The Fountainhead"" is a movie made about giants, by giants. Reality be damned, this movie is worthy of ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Metropolis"" and ""Double Indemnity.""
Now, once you've seen the movie, then read the book, which is even better! Do it the other way around, and you'll find yourself ""what-if""ing the Fountainhead that could've been, rather than basking in this sterling example of 1940s cinema.",1011398400,42,3845,5.48566610455312

396493,4,6301969294,"Gary Cooper was well cast as the architect of ultimate principle and so noble a character might be hard to conceive, yet his portrayal of protagonist ""Howard Roark"" is sterling if not entirely moving. This is no fault of Mr. Cooper for he strives to portray a purity of motive that may be impossible. Worse is the premise of the film: that 'self-sacrifice' for public good is a craven defeat for the individualist who should have the integrity of his convictions, and that to himself alone.
The denouement showing the fate of the titular antagonist, ""Gail Wynand"", as essayed by Raymond Massey, is somewhat stilted and not entirely believable, but the prose is certainly vivid if not hyperbolically purple in this overblown morality play with the modes of architecture used to show the conflicts in the modes and mores of man. Patricia Neal's spoiled rich girl character swings from neurotically icy to suddenly torrid with nary a bedroom scene in sight yet serves no clear motivation for the drama, merely a convenient (and salacious) nexus for the meeting of events.
Though architecture is used allegorically in the background, one learns little of it, but the story does bring to the fore a consideration of one's responsibility to posterity versus contemporary community. While we all can sympathize with the outrage of someone taking his labors of love and altering them without his consent, the point of the film (that ultimately one is only responsible to one's self) is lost to those who realize that human society could not long endure if each individual determined to stand apart regardless of the affect of his actions upon the whole, the body of man. When the architect takes matters into his own hands to the extent of breaking the law in a violent act that could endanger the public, the viewer's sympathy for him should vanish, for he demonstrates - and later proclaims in a monumental speech - that egoism is in his opinion, of greater importance than the public good. To be exculpated from such a demonstration vitiates what vaunted integrity the premise may have had and shows by the fate of newspaper publisher Wynand's recourse, the hollow hubris of self-made men.
As a pretty morality play the movie is interesting and well acted, and visually splendid if not somewhat wordy and stagy, but as a proclamation of righteous, God-given morals, if falls entirely short.",1003795200,6,2385,4.935323383084577

396559,2,6301969294,"I have been accused of being a collectivist because I do not enjoy Ayn Rand's novels.  I'd always tried to argue that it wasn't the message that I disagreed with, but the delivery.  In fact, I whole heartedly believe that man's individuality is his greatest strength, that true virtue can only be reached when man stands alone, and that a person should not have to compromise his or her vision to serve society.  I also don't suffer under the delusion that this is an amazing revelation and that I am one of the few people in the world that understands this.
Unfortunately, her writing and the film adaptation of her book ""The Fountainhead"" makes it clear that she did believe this. The way people talk is ridiculous.  Nearly everything that came out of the mouths of the ""bad guys"" was something like: ""What hope can one man have to stand against the will of the majority?  In an age such as ours we can not afford to have individuals who dare hold their own vision.""  The dialogue is really that silly.
Rand called her style of writing Romantic Realism.  Romantic because it dealt with people not as they are, but as they should be.  Realism because her stories were set in the real world.  Since the good guys (like the supreme egoist and hero of the film Howard Roark) embody her Romantic ideal, I am only left to believe that she put the bad guys (the conformists and collectivists) into the realism column.  That is absurd.  I'm sorry Ms. Rand, but people don't talk like that, and very very few people think like that.
That is the main flaw of this film and Ayn Rand's fiction in general -- it is not set in the real world.  Her message would have been countless times more effective had it strived to show the more subtle ways that people are made to conform and compromise.  Instead of this, however, we get a steady stream of things like ""the vision of one man is unimportant compared to the will of the people.""
In some ways I can understand Rand's paranoia.  She fled Russia when the communists took over and came to America, the only country that was founded on similar ideals as she held.  I'm sure that in Russia around the time of the revolution there was more talk of the kind found in this movie (though I can't help but think the dialogue would've made even Lenin groan).  Even so, the societal picture she paints doesn't really apply to American audiences.  The message -- yes, the delivery -- no.
There is no subtlety to the plot or the dialogue, there is no depth to the characters or the performances, and to be honest most of the movie is so hokey that it will keep you rolling on the floor.
Howard Roark himself said that form must follow function.  Indeed it should, and Ayn Rand would probably do well to follow her own advice.",978307200,10,2754,4.463073852295409
396560,1,6301969294,"The late Ayn Rand was the supreme proof of George Orwell's comment that only intellectuals can come up with certain ideas, because no ordinary person could be so stupid. This film, which is, quite simply, the most unintentionally funny movie I have ever seen,is valuable only because it shows clearly why so many people who ranted (her name really should have been Ayn Rant)about the (very real) horrors of Communism in the years after World War One eventually wound up snugly in the grasp of Herr Schicklgruber and his little elves. (And, yes, I know that Rand wasn't herself a Nazi; she just played one in print -- and here, on screen.)

The proposition that, even after years of getting high-profile commissions, Cooper is STILL helplessly at the mercy of unfeeling mediocrities, who can kill off his entire career with one press release? The notion that one can be put on trial for the crime of not following mass taste?(In AMERICA????? -- where the biggest problem has always been ESTABLISHING a tradition, not breaking free of one.)And, of course, like any good fascist, Miss Rand never concerns herself with corny old concepts like right and wrong. (""Beyond Good and Evil"", doncha know.)Cooper actually DID commit the act of vandalism for which he is tried; yet his acquittal is treated like a triumph of justice(presumably because no one Miss Rand cared about happened to get caught in that explosion he set off).And the homosexual subtext of this film -in the relationship between Cooper and his former enemy the publisher-is nothing short of hilarious.(When the boys plan their around-the-world cruise together, you don't need to wait for the dialogue to tell you that Patricia Neal won't be coming along).Finally, what makes this whole enterprise even wackier is that Rand doesn't even have the consistency of her own idiocy. The idea that a man like Cooper - proud, rugged, the ultimate loner- would allow a no-talent rival, WITH HIS BLESSING, to take one of his most prized concepts and pass it off as his own makes utter nonsense of everything we have been shown up to that point.

396561,3,6301969294,"THE FOUNTAINHEAD's protagonist, Howard Roark, is loosely based on the life of maverick architect Frank Lloyd Wright, and many of Roark's buildings are patterned after Wright's works.
Howard Roark is a fiercely independent  architect who would prefer obscurity and anonymity over wealth and  popularity by not conforming to the common expectations of a collectivist  society.
Hollywood likes to make films based on best-selling books  because they come with a built-in audience. However, in the case of Ayn  Rand's epic; ""The Fountainhead"", translating a novel replete with  lengthy didactic speeches into a Hollywood blockbuster proved extremely  difficult, especially since Rand wrote the screenplay herself and insisted  that no dialogue be changed without her approval. The result, while a  failure at the box office, continues to be one of the most noteworthy of  American films.
The lasting power of the film lies not in the quality of  acting or cleverness of plot, but in the power of Rand's message: that all  progress and achievement come from the independent mind; and that NO one  should be forced to work for the ""common good"" or  conform to the  wishes of others.  It is this message to which all other elements of the  film are subordinated.
MOVIE SYNOPSIS
Roark meets architecture critic  Dominique Francon while she surveys her father's stone quarry. The two fall  in love but Roark suddenly leaves for New York to take a commission.  Dominique decides to marry Gail Wynand, the arrogant, rich publisher of  "" The Banner"", a newspaper that delivers to the public what they  want to hear. Within these pages Roark is initially attacked for his  radical designs. Eventually Wynand realizes Roark's talents.
Peter  Keating, an unscrupulous architect, hires Roark to ghost-design a public  housing project for him. Roark agrees on the condition that the building be  built *exactly* as he designed it and never to be altered from his designs.  When it becomes clear that the plans were modified, Roark blows up the  unfinished buildings, preferring to go to jail than to see his vision and  his integrity compromised.
In the end, Roark heroically and symbolically  rises above society as the final shot zooms upward with the architect  perched above all else: his direction comes not from the opinions or values  or expectations of others, but from the integrity of his own inner vision,  values, and commitments;  and to keep faith within the best of oneself at  all costs.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Rather than define her characters, Rand  makes each one an analogy for different parts of her thesis  the conflict  between individualism and society's need for order and conformity: Roark  symbolizing freedom of choice, reason, human ability and achievment through  individual rights, political and economic freedom - while the ruthless  reporter Ellsworth Toohey represents the collectivist-socialist who  preaches self-sacrifice, altruism and charity as a means to power over  other human beings. Other characters represent varying degrees of the  theme; their role is to challenge Roark's strength and courage of mind. As  such, this film is a useful teaching tool for a discussion of Rand's  theory.  But behind the primary theme of individualism versus collectivism,  Rand also presented her readers and viewers with two other topics to  consider: the nearly absolute power of the media in a free capitalist  society, and the intricacies of romantic relationships between  uncompromising people.
IN CLOSING
Despite its failure with audiences  and critics, ""The Fountainhead"" takes its place among the  literary classics as it forces us to confront and examine the role of the  individual in our society.

396566,5,6301969294,"The first time I saw this movie, circa 1969, I was disappointed.  I felt it was melodramatically presented, in black and white, and in two hours it was an injustice to the novel's power and grandeur.  The actors did not  seem to measure up, or buy in, to the characters they portrayed.  This  movie review, thirty years ago, would have rated ""The  Fountainhead"" as, at best, two stars.  It was a definite embarassment  to most Ayn Rand devotees at the time.
The five star rating I give the  movie today, thirty years and numerous viewings later, is a very personal,  indivdualized one.  Through these eyes,  ""The Fountainhead"" is  enormously moving, well-cast and very well portrayed, if you're the kind of  person who relates to: (1) the struggle between integrity and conformity in  our private and business lives  (2) the travails of entrepreneurship  and  perseverance in the face of spirit crushing adversity  (3) the belief that  there is definable difference between good and evil, and that it is really  possible for the former to prevail.
Several of Gary Cooper's scenes as  Howard Roark are profoundly memorable:  (1)  when he refuses money from  Peter Keating after showing him he was down to his last few cents  (2) when  he walks out on the munificent offer from the bank board to build a  mutation of his bank design (3) the party scene when Dominique discovers  the quarry worker she had obsessed over was Roger Enright's architect,  Howard Roark.
There's more.  Great camera angles, strong dialogue from  the supporting cast, especially Ellsworth Toohey.
Summarily, the  director, screenplay people and actors did a magnificent job within the two  hour confines of making a riveting movie.

You might compare it to the book, or set it against a standard of expression for a philosophical idea. Or, you just might watch it absolutely for itself, in a sort of self-defined manner. Everything depends upon the standard of judgment.

I admit that there were parts of this movie that seemed awkward or condensed from a story perspective. However, such as each his or her own, we tend to like a movie that hooks us, often by attaching to something inside ourselves. Something in the movie with which we identify.

What I loved about the movie is the essential message: the man's own belief in himself was a stronger force than the attacks could break down. Make the man an outcast, ridicule him, take his money. Take away everything society offers. Then we see what makes the man. Such as it was for Socrates, Jesus, and many others. Take it all away and there is nothing left, but the man and the principle that the man holds. This is the integrity of the man, and it is what holds the man together, from the inside out, not the outside in.

The strength of the many is not the truth, the strength of the many is simply the many. The truth can stand alone, naked, and all by itself. The less adorned, the more essential. All strength comes from the inside, that is the only true source of strength, and nothing is as strong if reliant upon an external.  The other characters who relied upon external society were made the whimsical playthings of society, unwitting victims at first, and then pathetic victims at last.

Roark succeeds because he listens only to the kingdom that is inside of him, and he wins by the integrity of a defense, without ever attacking, simply by staying true to himself.",1512432000,,1817,4.493939393939394
