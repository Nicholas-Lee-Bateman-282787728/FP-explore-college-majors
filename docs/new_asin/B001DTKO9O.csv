8294836,4,B001DTKO9O,"I saw this documentary yesterday on HBO. I have always noticed Helen in the press room of the White House and wondered ""who is that lady"". Who she is is an amazing journalist who cares nothing about making friends but cares A LOT about getting the truth from our leaders. This documentary was just great. As a journalism major, I have a lot of respect for Helen and what she does. It was definitely worth a watch...BUT $24.98?! I consider that very expensive for a 45 minute documentary. Also, the doc may have extras that I did not get to see since I watched it on HBO. Overall, a great doc by Rory Kennedy. I just wish it would've been longer. I mean, Helen has covered 10 presidents (including Obama), certainly there was more to tell us about her experiences.",1232496000,,763,4.457142857142857
8294837,4,B001DTKO9O,"Imagine sitting down for an afternoon of conversation with someone who has known nine sitting US presidents.  Helen Thomas has had an extraordinary life and career as part of the White House Press Corps. She shares those memories in this film that often illustrates them with still photos or video.  You will stay focused on every word and image.  I admire Ms. Thomas for her candor and honesty and for sharing at last the personal opinions that she had to carefully withhold from her reporting over the years. Jimmy Carter was a
""very spiritual man"".  Gerald Ford was ""nice, a very good person"".  LBJ lied and lost his credibility.  And the extreme right wing harassed Clinton unfairly and continually way beyond what was needed, stealing time from the President that was needed to govern.  George W. Bush is seen at a press conference, appearing to be in over his head and becomes petulant when Helen asks a hard question he is ill prepared to answer.  Rory Kennedy does an excellent job of picking out many interesting episodes from Helen's life at the White House and weaves them in with visuals, quotes and opinions that will often open your eyes and give you a new perspective on who the President is and what he does.  Very well done and worth your time.",1232323200,,1261,4.669683257918552
