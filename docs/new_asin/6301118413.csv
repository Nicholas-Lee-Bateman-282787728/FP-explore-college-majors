318306,5,6301118413,I have seen this movie on TV over 25 years ago when I was a younger man. I loved the children in this movie who are already grown up by now. This is the type of movie that I would want my children to watch if I had any. To whoever has the power to do so. PLEASE MAKE THIS MOVIE INTO A DVD. Thank you,1116720000,19,299,3.5454545454545454
318307,5,6301118413,"I live in England, am 22 years of age and saw this film on it's only showing in the UK about 8 years ago. I love the story and it really touched my heart.

I wish I didn't love this film so much but I do, my reason for saying this is, it was only realised on video in the US and therefore is not watchable on UK format. I wish they would bring it out on DVD so it can be enjoyed by all who loved it.

I did have a copy that was tapped from television and was unfortunately destroyed in a flood, I have been looking for it ever since.

This film is steeped in US history, it is about a group of orphaned children who make a journey across America, to find families who will love and care for them. Anybody with a heart will love this film as much as I did.

If anybody knows of anyway that I can get a copy that can be viewed in the UK please email me at Kazem0482@aol.com thank you.",1104624000,9,882,3.82967032967033
318308,4,6301118413,I highly recommend this movie.  It's a good reminder to us how orphaned children in America greatly struggled in our early days before federal programs were put in place to help them.  One caution:  the hanging scene of a 15-year-old boy may be disturbing to elementary school-aged children.,1072828800,7,291,5.020833333333333
318309,5,6301118413,"I first taped this outstanding movie from television when it was run on  one of the major networks many years ago.  Before I retired from teaching  6th and then 4th graders, I showed it every year-- not as just  entertainment, but as an excellent social studies and ""values""  teaching tool.  The children LOVED it!  Of course the movie's theme is  based on *many* true stories of the Orphan Trains which ran not only in the  U.S. but also in Canada.  With but a little research I was able to find  ""local"" stories of people who actually came to the Texas  Panhandle on such trains.  And I note that there are several books on the  subject which could also be used in conjunction with the movie.
  An  added value of the movie is to make today's children know how *lucky* they  have it today.  The movie also illustrates how the first photography  worked,  how some of the children risked abuse by uncaring families, and  how rampant outright bigotry was in those days.
  This video would make  a wonderful gift for libraries in schools which know the value of good  audio-visuals!",968457600,37,1080,4.582010582010582
318310,5,6301118413,"Orphan Train is a wonderful story of the early life of the NY orphan train, taking homeless children out west to find new homes.  You get to know the children, what obsicales they had to overcome and the joy of them  finding a home.  It is a story of Emma, an orphan herself, undertaking the  job that her recently deceased uncle had started, and a story about the  children themselves.  The children actors and actresses have done a  wonderful job portraying their counterparts.  The ending is the best part.  It always makes me cry happy tears.",961804800,16,546,4.604166666666667
318370,5,6301118413,"I know many of these children did not get good homes, although this movie had happy endings.  A little on the preachy side to begin with, but pretty true to history.  It was a fictionalized account of true history.",1374883200,2,214,4.461538461538462
318371,4,6301118413,"First a few minor problems: The tape was recorded in high speed, which resulted in degraded picture quality and awful sound. While Glenn Close gets a top billing, she appears for about 1 minute total. Historical fact wise, it gives the impression that little ""up front"" work was done before the kids were sent on a trip. Not true. It also shows the kids traveling in a baggage car with no seats. I never read an account of anything other than traveling in a regular passenger car, either dedicated to the kids, or mixed in with regular passengers.

The good stuff: the casting and acting was so good it brought a tear to my eyes 3 times.",1374019200,,637,4.444444444444445
318372,5,6301118413,"I did find this out: If you run the title along with Jill Eikenberry through ""search"" on your computer, it does come up to watch FREE at the moment on one site:).  I too, saw this many years ago and loved it.  I'm sure the actual lives and conditions the children of that time period endured were worse than pictured, but we get some sense of their lives.  We all love happy endings!  Though it is a bit blurry that won't interfere with your family's enjoyment in watching it.  In the meantime, as another reviewer requests: DVD please!",1371859200,,536,4.428571428571429

318374,5,6301118413,"I've always loved this movie since I first saw it when I was a kid.  They used to replay it every few years throughout the 80s and in the early 90s I bought it on videotape.  I've started a new Facebook group called ""Bring the 1979 TV Movie Orphan Train to DVD already!""  If you are on Facebook check it out, maybe we can all do something to get it put on DVD!",1292976000,,360,3.904109589041096
318375,4,6301118413,This was a great movie. The quality was a bit grainey due to age and being vhs. I converted it to DVD to add to my collection. Came Out fine. I just loved Melissa Michaelson in this.,1291680000,2,182,3.945945945945946
318376,5,6301118413,I first saw this movie on VHS many years ago and greatly enjoyed it.  It kept my attention from beginning to end.  It's an excellent portrayal of a little known time in US history.  It's just a small slice of that time yet gives a viewer an inside peek into the system as it functioned.  I hope someone is will put it into DVD format.,1283904000,2,334,4.092307692307692
318377,5,6301118413,I am very pleased with all of the movies that I received. I will be sure and buy some again.,1265587200,,92,3.65
318378,3,6301118413,"The only reason I bought this video is because of John Femia (he played Tony), of whom I am a great fan.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this film is otherwise.  It certainly kept my attention all the way through, although it was heartbreaking at times.  All in all a good movie, certainly worth watching.",1225152000,,322,4.517241379310345

7810137,5,6301118413,I've been looking for this movie everywhere. Glad I got it finally. I really like this movie. Wish it were available on dvd & not only on vhs but glad I can watch it again. Thank you for having it so I got to get it again.,1437523200,,222,3.74468085106383

7810143,1,6301118413,The quality of the VHS tape is terrible and graining. This movie was never converted to DVD and we had hoped to be able to copy it to a DVD but you can barely see it.  Very unhappy with the quality.,1401321600,,198,3.8292682926829267
