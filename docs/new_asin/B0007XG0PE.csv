8053527,5,B0007XG0PE,"I've like the ""Touched by an Angel"" television series, but never watched ""Highway to Heaven"" when television aired it's series. I then purchased Highway to Heaven, Seasons 1-3, in dvd.  The series are so inspiring, I am waitlisted for Seasons 4 & 5. In the series, the 2 awesome actors, Michael Landon and Victor French, portray 2 characters that couldn't be more different from each other, yet, together, they share a common goal to comfort the sick, mend broken families, and guide souls in need of love.  The series are packed with humor, challenging assignments, compassion and so much more!  With so much violence currently aired on television, the Highway To Heaven collection is a must have for families who search for good, wholesome family entertainment.  Each episode delivers a great inspirational message. I can't wait for Seasons 4 & 5 to become available.",1316649600,2,869,5.013888888888889

There was always a tear in the eye after your shows!",1197331200,2,160,4.482758620689655
8053529,5,B0007XG0PE,"It has been really great watching Highway to Heaven. Michael Landon is the best actress of old times. The movies are for kids also, parents don't have to worry about their kids learning anything they shouldnt. Watching these movies, has really changed me and my family. An Angel sent to help people in need, and to really change their life, is what lifes all about. What a great ending.",1173916800,,386,4.608695652173913
8053530,5,B0007XG0PE,"I love this show.  I watch it every day on T.V. land.  I grew up with 3 sisters and watched Landon in Little House, and then Highway to Heaven.  I was the saddest 12 year old on the planet when I found out he died.  He is by far my favorite actor, and a class act to boot.  My wife and I have decided that if we have a son, we'll name him Landon.  Oh... and check out ""Where Pidgeons Go to Die"" also.
