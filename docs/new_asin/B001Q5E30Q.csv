I was a bit sceptical until after a full implementation of the smoothering defence and other skills and plays from this and other DVD's and books in this series our team was able to hold last years Champs to - 26 yards rushing and then proceeded to win our first ever league Championship Nov 7, 2009. I have never met Dave Cisar and have nothing but good to say about the materials he produces.

Each DVD has a lot of information and be ready to watch each play over and over until you are completely familiar with it and can teach it correctly to your players.
