Some people call beavers 'rodents' and some would even consider harming one of these wobbly little big-toothed creatures...but after your first dose of PAPA BEAVER's STORY TIME, you'll be scouring the wetlands of America looking for one of these little love-filled guys to hug!  Papa Beaver pours his little heart and soul into every tale he tells...mesmerizing young, old, and rodent alike with his own re-telling of timeless classics and new 'off the fuzzy-cuff' children's pleasers.  You won't get a more entertaining video for the money...and you'll look forward to that 'special time' each evening that YOU get to relax and cuddle-up with North America's best-loved flat-tailed gentleman...WE LOVE YOU PAPA BEAVER!",1154649600,4,782,5.248
