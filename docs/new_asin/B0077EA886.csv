5060812,5,B0077EA886,"This blu-ray disc special edition release is the most complete of any of the various editions released in Europe and the USA as it has not only the 6 part feature length documentary included on the blu-ray (unlike the sorry mess of the UK blu-ray) but also 4 music videos featuring songs from the film in High Definition.

Includes MASSIVE wedding dress fabric poster 30 "" by 40 ""  (30 inches by 40 inches) which covers an entire dining room table set for 6 people. Although I think it is designed to be hung on a wall rather than used as a dining table cover. The material is quite strong , it will not rip. It can easily be ironed ( I had mine on the highest steam setting to eliminate wrinkles but obviously don't iron on the transfer side )

It also features full dts HD-MA 7.1 Audio whereas the European versions are only 5.1 audio.

Also includes the exclusive 6 part making of documentary that spans almost one and a half hours and was promised to be on the UK edition but not included due to an error at processing stage.

5060813,1,B0077EA886,"To start off, I already hate this Saga..
But that is not the reason I gave it a 1 star. I bought this for my wife, who is a huge fan of the book series and subsequently of the movies as well. I had seen the same edition of this movie with the DVD package and it looked really pretty. So I bought this one thinking it would be a blu-ray case White wedding... To my disappointment(same feeling from my wife) it was just a box that was white containing just a regular blu-ray with a single disc and not even any relevant special features.... Well I wouldn't expect anything good from these guys since all of this is purely commercial ( I know almost everything has that commercial angle, but there are those who would at least try to give you your money's worth of goods, and not just get your money and run leaving with a hafl baked product).
I'm sure there are better version of this movie but surely this ain't it... But my wife just was happy with the movie so she didn't really fuss.",1335916800,12,985,4.216931216931217

8511746,3,B0077EA886,"Breaking Dawn Part 1 is probably the better of the Twilight movies. Although Bella's Wedding Edition is not really that exciting. I wish I realized that the only difference between the regular Blu-Ray and this, is the fabric poster... I assumed there would be extra interviews or bloopers but there wasn't. I'd say, if you'd like to own it, don't spend the extra money on this version.",1356480000,,385,4.7611940298507465
