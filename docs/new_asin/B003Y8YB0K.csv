A new premise of zombie creation is brought forth, which is always new and welcome in itself.  A lumber corporation is genetically enhancing tree growth to speed production, but an accident causes the mutation to spread to humans and cause them to turn into zombies going on a strict all you can eat meat diet.  There are a few scenes with a lot of blood and gore but most of the scenes are insinuated and you never see them being ripped apart, only blood splatters from both the zombies and those killing the zombies.

  The story takes place 200 miles from the nearest city, so the loggers and the environmentalist are on their own and isolated.  The corporation has started clean up and contamination procedures and has labeled all involved as dead or expendable to keep what has happened there a secret and the corporations involvement out of it.  So there is no rescue party coming and everyone is truly on there own.  The only hope they have lies within themselves, and unfortunately like so many other zombie movies there are always some morons that manages to get most everyone killed.  Acting was good and everything seemed believable and in proper place.  A Zombie movies that thinks outside the box, and doesn't just check the normal things that you might see in a zombie movie off the list.  A Must add if your a zombie movie collector.",1294099200,,1536,4.711610486891386
