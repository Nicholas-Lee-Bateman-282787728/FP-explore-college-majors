8202097,4,B000RPCJAW,"Volker Schlondorff has offered a sincere and finely-crafted portrait of a working class woman, culminating in a fairy-tale-like triumph that few of her class and gender ever witness.  Though it does not achieve the sweep of Vajda's ""Man of Iron,"" it is a faithful if slightly fictionalized recreation of the Solidarity movement that well captures the spirit of its time and era.  The inclusion of contemporary archival footage underscores its realism for those unfamiliar with its story.

I see that other reviewers read into the film - and the Solidarity movement - the prevailing Western consensus that it ""began the end of Communism"", etc.  This is hardly the case.  As one of those Leftists vilified by others, I must say that I never ""hated"" Solidarity, and thus I have no fundamental issue with this recreation.  It portrays the struggle of real working people, following a template that applied to so many labor struggles in Europe, Latin America and - for that matter - the US throughout most of the 20th century.  But the intervening history between the triumph of 1980 and the spiritual defeat of Solidarity is glossed over in the film.

The Solidarity of 1980-1981 was crushed by General Jaruszelski's tanks and praetorian troops.  What emerged in 1989 bore no resemblance to this movement, and the real character fictionalized here - Anna Walentynowicz - has been among those former leaders deploring Poland's evolution under a false-flag Solidarnosc.  Another Solidarity leader, Karol Modzelewski, said at the time of this film's release to Le Monde diplomatique that ""I wouldn't have spent a week nor a month, let alone 8.5 years in jail for capitalism!""

If Communism in Poland was defeated in Poland, so was the democracy, inspiration, and passion for justice the film portrays - to say nothing of the very livelihoods of the strikers.  ""Wait til your friends in the West take over the shipyard!"" prophesies ""Bochnak,"" the bloodied and beaten shipyard director.  Thus by Solidarity's 25th anniversary 90% of its 20,000-strong workforce had been downsized, working in service ""industries"" or in construction work in Ireland, if employed at all.  ""Let the Holy Ghost come over this land,"" Pope John Paul II invokes in his pre-Solidarity visit, with Agnieszka rapt before her ""televisor.""  If hydrofracking and nuclear missile bases are the manifestations of the Pope's blessing, the spirit of Solidarity is indeed dead and buried.",1410480000,,2444,5.151898734177215
8202098,4,B000RPCJAW,"Katharina Thalbach, as many have said, gives a wonderful performance in this film about the rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland. The film was shot at the Gdansk shipyards, which certainly adds to the authenticity and impact of the story, though the director has not chosen to make a political documentary or attempt a grand-scale treatment of the upheaval that brought an end to the communist domination of Eastern Europe. Rather, his focus is personal and intimate, on the character of the illiterate welder who emerges from obscurity to become the focus of the workers' uprising. At times the domesticity of the film-maker's focus saps some of the tension out of the story, although it might be argued that this was a necessary sacrifice to get the particular story, with its own particular mood, across to the audience.",1390521600,,828,4.9640287769784175
8202099,5,B000RPCJAW,"""STRIKE"" is a true story of the Polish People and their great fight for freedom against the communist authorities who had ruled them since the defeat of the Nazis.

This should be purchased along with the DVD, and another true story of the courage of the Polish People during their long struggle for freedom, ""TO KILL A PRIEST"".",1365552000,,328,4.655172413793103
8202100,3,B000RPCJAW,The subtitle editor ruined the whole experience; s/he framed the whole movie from being a workers' tale to a competition between two activists. In the end the crowd cheering for Solidarnosk (the movement of Solidarity that carried the struggle to begin with) was shown in the subtitles to be cheering for the young emerging political leader as oppose to the central hero turning the legendary fight into some non-existent gender competition. It was extremely frustrating seeing such a marvel being lost in the subtitles! Hence the 3 stars only.,1338336000,,544,5.123595505617978
8202101,5,B000RPCJAW,"Twenty years (1960-1980) are covered in this moving and enjoyable fictional treatment of Polish history as played out in the shipyards of Gdansk, which gave birth to the Solidarity Movement that helped bring an end to Communist rule behind the Iron Curtain. German director Volker Schlorndorff focuses on the life of a dedicated shipyard welder, an unmarried mother, whose devotion to the ideals of socialism is transformed by the mismanagement of the shipyard directors and the lack of support by the union meant to serve workers' interests. As unrest fuels the overworked and underpaid laborers, she becomes a champion of their rights and wins the enmity of the Party while becoming a heroine to coworkers.

Meanwhile, we get glimpses of a personal life marked by her brief marriage to a jazz musician and haunted by a long ago liaison with a labor boss, who is the father of her son. It is a richly and warmly told story of an individual life that refuses to be undaunted by forces beyond her control and holds out for sweeping political reform. In the end, the irony is that communism's goal of uniting workers is finally used against the Party machinery meant to achieve that very objective. The film has wonderful performances, a perfectly plausible script, and a soundtrack that includes lyrical jazz interludes. Very satisfying.",1239926400,,1336,4.99103139013453
8202102,5,B000RPCJAW,"Katharina Thalbach gives a brilliant performance as shipyard welder and crane operator Agnieszka Kowalska, who is unjustly fired by the shipyard managers of Gdansk shipyard for protesting the denial of widows pensions for workers killed in a fire at the shipyard, a fire caused by management incompetence.

  Her stubborn insistence on justice and refusal to be payed off or intimidated by the shipyard management or Polish Government caused the strike on the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980 which spread to other Polish shipyards and public services across Poland all of which led to the creation of the first free unions and ultimately free elections in Poland 10 years later. Consequently, the consequences of her actions were a part of several domestic and military setbacks for the Soviet Union which ultimately led to its collapse.

  Thalback put in a superb performance as Kowalska who shows that one person at the right time and place can lead to dramatic change for the good.",1219795200,6,984,5.080745341614906
