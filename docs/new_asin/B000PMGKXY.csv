2825641,5,B000PMGKXY,I am an avid competitor in dog bowls and I take veterinary exams when I'm only 14. This video is great if you want to learn the basic background of dogs and I highly recommend it! Very interesting video.,1324771200,2,203,4.230769230769231
2825642,5,B000PMGKXY,Very informative! Enjoyed every minute of the two part series! I'm an avid canine lover so this one is a great addition to the DVD collection.,1323648000,,142,4.5
2825643,5,B000PMGKXY,"I saw this program on PBS last night and first thing this morning looked it up and purchased it here. My husband and I both really enjoyed the in depth look at the Dog's history in society and many of the different view points of evolution. Really a great show, one of the best I've seen in a long time, and the only I've felt was worth purchasing to watch again.",1317859200,2,363,4.126760563380282
2825644,5,B000PMGKXY,This is a great family video.  It's very educational and at the same time interesting.  We and our grandkids loved it.,1252713600,,118,4.571428571428571
2825645,5,B000PMGKXY,One of the most informative and entertaining show that I have ever seen.  I purchased 5 copies for Christmas presents for dog-loving family and friends. A copy should be in all primary and secondary school libraries.,1200787200,3,216,5.0
2825646,5,B000PMGKXY,"This is possibly the best video I have ever seen about the evolution of dogs and how their relationship with people came to be. If you want a video that will 'fill in the gaps' on some of this information, don't miss this opportunity. It is beautifully, wonderfully done.",1200528000,3,271,4.551020408163265
2825647,5,B000PMGKXY,"I just watched part 1 of this program on PBS last night. It was so good that I decided to come to Amazon and buy the dvd. I was amazed at the historical evolution of our 4 legged best friends. I found myself saying out loud ""Wow"" over and over again. It's that good. It gave me a new appreciation for my dogs and also talked about the relationship humans have had with dogs from the beginning. They are amazing animals, incredibly adaptable and historically very important to the survival of the human race. I will be buying this dvd to see part 2 and I'm sure it will be equally as enlightening and entertaining as the first part. Even if you aren't a dog owner I think you could appreciate the significance of dogs in our lives and the gifts they have bestowed on us throughout time.",1200268800,21,785,4.3108108108108105
2825648,5,B000PMGKXY,"This is a fascinating program following the development of our relationship with dogs. Through the same genetic information now indicating where on earth man developed and how he changed, scientists are following the dramatic changes the dog has undergone, including how special, how wondrous is the canine link to us",1181001600,14,317,5.36
2825649,5,B000PMGKXY,"The first time I watched this program, I was amazed at all the interesting facts I hadn't known about my three mutts, and I enjoyed the photography of dogs working and frolicking and just being dogs in such a wide variety of ways.  The second time I watched, I paid closer attention, and the importance of what these scientists were saying struck me.  If the reasoned speculation of this documentary is true (much of it is yet unproven) humans owe a debt of gratitude to dogs for enabling our entire culture.

Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated, and they domesticated themselves.  It wasn't our doing.  Of course, the wolves who chose to live near, and then with humans didn't consciously choose to create a new species, but the domestication of the dog led to all sorts of other advancements.  Dogs improved our ability to hunt, using their superior senses of smell and hearing.  Dogs guarded our homes.  Dogs helped us domesticate other animals, such as sheep and goats.  The abilities of dogs permitted us to live in harsh environments, such as the Arctic, where we could not have survived alone.  And all along the way, they have been loving companions, members of our families.

The importance of this documentary is hard to overstate.  First, if you take away the domestication of the dog, then we would still be hunter-gatherers, probably less than a hundred million in population, and just another insignificant animal on the planet.  ( As would be the wolf.)  The knowledge contained in all the books on Amazon would not have been obtained if not for the success and lifestyle changes granted to us by our association with dogs.  The co-evolution of two species has made all this possible.  Homo sapiens cannot be rightly said to be a species in and of itself; it is a member of a species complex including Canis lupus familiaris, as well as cows, pigs, chickens, wheat, corn, etc.

The second important implication to take away from this documentary is: considering how critical the dog has been to our entire way of life, what other species might we associate with to our mutual advantage?  We are currently driving species to extinction faster than we can even identify and catologue them.  What fantastic advances in knowledge and culture might we be denying ourselves by blindly marginalizing and destroying other species?

Most people who watch this documentary may not be as awestruck as I have been by the magnitude of its implications.  The documentary itself is not making these far-reaching claims, merely suggesting them.  Even if you are just looking for some entertainment, you should find this program highly enjoyable.  It contains excellent photography and travels all around the world as it explores the ordinary and extraordinary dog.",1179100800,48,2774,4.918279569892473
2825650,5,B000PMGKXY,Very informative and I enjoyed it very much,1409097600,,43,4.5
2825651,5,B000PMGKXY,"Dogs originated in Asia and are now found all over the world. We learn from sheepherders that they couldn't do their work without their dogs and from owners of sled dogs in the Arctic who totally rely on their dogs. Doctors rely on the reliability of the sense of smell of dogs to detect cancer and type 1 diabetes in their patients.
Unfortunately, many dogs have to be killed because they were trained to be vicious.",1382140800,2,417,4.5
2825652,5,B000PMGKXY,A very interesting and compelling theory is proposed that dogs were instrumental in advancing the human race beyond our hunter and gatherer stage of development.  It almost makes you wonder how we could be where we are without them.  The intelligence of border collies and the amazing stamina of huskies shows just how exceptional the species can be.  It is really quite humbling. Recommended for all humans.,1381536000,,408,5.059701492537314
2825653,4,B000PMGKXY,"After watching in entirety and some parts twice, I have both positive and negative feelings about this video:
I learned a lot and it made me think about things never thought of before; I was able to see some types of dogs never knew about (hairless, desert hunters) and I enjoyed the graphics demonstrating dog moving (spine features, heart, etc.). But, it has only two parts and is rather short and was a little expensive in retrospect - more like something the library should have (I will probably donate to) and finally, much of the information presented is opinion-only.",1373932800,3,574,4.808080808080808
2825654,4,B000PMGKXY,"This is an interesting video, in two parts (one disk).  There's a certain amount of fluff, but the visuals were fun, and I learned some things.  There are no special features or extras included, but the DVD played smoothly.  I liked the story of the family with the dog who would alert to their son's impending seizures, and the difference this had made for the boy.  The demonstration of the dogs who could sniff out cancer cells in a test tube was amazing, and gives a person some hope.",1372291200,2,488,4.449438202247191
2825655,5,B000PMGKXY,For use in MS Biotech curriculum - Teaches the value of dogs in present and past society. Helps guide students into a better understanding of the careers within the canine care and training realm. Important tool to show that dogs are not just family pets but are valuable service animals.,1353974400,,288,4.78
2825656,5,B000PMGKXY,Good Video! Kept the Attention of my Husband & I & was well worth the money spent to Watch this Video! I would recommend this. It's definitely worth the money!,1352937600,,159,4.333333333333333
2825657,4,B000PMGKXY,"There's only one thing I like more than a coupla hours of dogs on DVD...that's people with English accents talking about dogs! Jolly good! This well-produced delivers an interesting, balanced look at the socio-evolutionary story of man's best friend.

In an age where pets are as much an accessory as anything else, I particularly appreciated the POV regarding the genetic nature of particular breeds. So often, well-meaning adopters choose a dog without fully considering the type of dog - like workers, hunters, etc. A fast and loose decision usually becomes a dog euthanasia statistic. NoPushover gives 4 paws for DTCTW! Woof!",1339632000,6,629,5.227722772277228

2825659,5,B000PMGKXY,My wife and I found this video to be very informative and entertaining. Better than I had hoped it would be when I bought it. The only downside is that for us it has limited replay value. Well worth watching once. Then loan to your friends and relatives.,1327190400,,254,4.3125

8192518,5,B000PMGKXY,This is very good.  Makes you really think of how far they have come and yet they are still very connected with the ancient. The countries that raise dogs for meat and treat them horribly and savagely kill them should see this.  They may think different of these wonderful creatures that are loyal to mankind,1474329600,,308,4.581818181818182
