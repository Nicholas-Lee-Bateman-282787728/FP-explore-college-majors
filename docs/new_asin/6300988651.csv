7809205,1,6300988651,"As I mentioned earlier, Season Three entered a slump starting with Wink of An Eye.  Unfortunately, That Which Survives is even worse than Wink of An Eye and it continued the Season Three slump.

This episode is clearly in the bottom ten. Spock is so mean. I wish Scotty would have jettisoned Spock into space. The acting is just plain awful and unnecessary scenes were added just to fill time! Spock is not the only one being mean. Kirk destroys Sulu every time he opens his mouth. It was only after Sulu almost died that he was nice to him. I want to say this is the worst of the series but there are a couple of episodes that are even worse.",1242259200,,643,4.262295081967213
7809206,2,6300988651,"As already noted, this one is a forgettable Trek, to be sure. But somehow, Trek, even when it is bad, is still pretty good.
Outside of a few good moments, such as Sulu firing his phaser at Losira's feet (pretty good explosion FX), and the nifty way the holograms disappear, this one blows pretty badly.  Still, it's better than the latest reality drama, or any episode of ""Lost in Space.""
Watch this one instead of the next ""WWF Smackdown"" -and save your brain.",1067472000,,461,4.554216867469879
7809207,3,6300988651,"As all fans know, this is a third/last season episode. Trrue Trekkies have little good to say about this episode and I agree it is far from perfect but it has some of the nicest visual effects of the series.
The acting is Monday-morning-terrible and the whole production is uneven but this is far from the worst episode. There is an effort and an interesting story, though it seems crammed in a 45 minute network show.
This story might have been better utilized and expanded in a feature film but who will ever know.
 For Trek fans only. It deserves a second viewing.",1037923200,3,567,4.504854368932039
7809208,3,6300988651,"In this, the 69th episode of classic Trek, Kirk and crew are exploring ruins found on a class-M planet that seems to have developed a livable climate in only a few thousand years.
The Enterprise landing party is attacked by Losira, a woman who kills a crewman with just a touch of her hand.  Meanwhile, the Enterprise is thrown almost a thousand light years away by the planet's hidden defense system.
More landing party members are attacked by Losira, until it is discovered that she can only attack the party member that she calls by name.  The remaining party then keep her from attacking the named crewmember.  Meanwhile, Scotty repairs some sabotage to the engines that Losira had accomplished before throwing the Enterprise out of orbit, and then hurries back to Losira's world.
Kirk discovers a hidden room with a highly advanced computer, and the defense mechanism there creates three Losiras - which keep them from protecting each other as they had previously.  The cavalry, in the form of Spock and a landing party, arrive just in time to deactivate the computer.
The previously taped message reveals that the planet had been artificially enhanced by colonists, who were affected by a disease that killed them all off.  The disease then followed the colonists back to their homeworld, supposedly wiping out the entire civilization.  Nothing but the computer program, which defends the planet from anyone who is not of Losira's race, remains.  The colonist's relief ship never arrived.
Kirk says beauty survives, because the computer continues to project an image of Losira even after delivering the message about the colonist's destruction.
My score - 5 out of a possible 10.",1029542400,4,1685,5.017921146953405
7809209,3,6300988651,"As a landing party prepares to beam down to a previously unexplored Class M planet, a beautiful woman, Losira, appears. She touches an ensign and kills him. Already dematerializing in the transporter beam, Kirk and the  rest of his party are helpless to stop her. Losira disappears.  The surge  of power that Losira's appearance caused hurtles the Enterprise 990.7 light  years away from where they were. Spock calculates that it will take 11.33  hours at warp 8.4 to return to the planet.  On the surface of the planet,  Kirk, McCoy, Sulu and geologist D'Amato discover the vegetation is  poisonous to humans and the rocks are made of an alloy that did not develop  naturally. Losira appears again and kills D'Amato, again, by merely  touching him. She vanishes, then reappears, this time for Sulu, but he  avoids her and they realize she can only harm the person whose name she  calls.  Kirk, Sulu and McCoy band together to keep her from killing them.  Losira reappears on the Enterprise, in engineering, and kills another  crewman. When Scotty insists that something ""feels"" wrong with  the ship, they discover that Losira had sabotaged the matter/antimatter  integrator. Scotty repairs the device before it has a chance to explode.  On the planet's surface, the landing party finds a chamber in the rocks  that houses a computer. They realize that this is where Losira appears  from. Losira appears to them again, this time in threes, so that she can  touch each officer at once.  Spock and a security team arrive and destroy  the computer what was projecting Losira's image. A visual recording  triggered by the computer shows that the planet was once an outpost of the  Kalandan race. It was ravaged by a deadly organism which supply ships  unknowingly carried back to their home world. With the computer destroyed,  the last of the Kalandans' is also dead.",943315200,2,1864,4.929032258064516
