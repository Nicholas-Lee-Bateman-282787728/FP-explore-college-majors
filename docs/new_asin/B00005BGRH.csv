1422483,4,B00005BGRH,"CARNIVAL OF SOULS & DEMENTIA 13 are two of the creepiest low budget movies in the 60s. Marengo films gave both of these movies a ggreat treatment by putting them together on one DVD. And the transfer was very good! CARNIVAL OF SOULS starring Candace Hilligoss is one of those genuinely creepy movies that send a chill down your spine. Effectively chilling despite its low budget.
DEMENTIA 13 is Francis Ford Coppola's debut feature. He put together a very intense & engaging movie with a very respectable cast that gave very credible performances. The standout performance of this movie was the late Patrick Magee. It would have been interesting if someone like Vincent Price would have gotten Magee's role as Magee reminds me of Price in a lot of ways. Very graphic for its time, especially the ax decapitation murder, DEMENTIA 13 is a forgotten classic. Luana Anders & Mary Mitchel are very sexy in their respective roles, especially Mitchel in that scene in which she walked around in a see-through nightgown while wearing her bra and panties!
A great buy! Two horror classics for the price of one.",1016582400,7,1101,4.830687830687831

7937389,2,B00005BGRH,"I own this double feature, let me start by saying the dvd case art is so poorly done that I threw it in the trash and now keep the dvd in a blank jewel case.  The transfers are OK, not horrible but not very well done.  The dvd main menu looks like something a highschool freshman did in computer graphics class.  Do yourself a favor and get the criterion version of COS, its worth it.",1421366400,,384,4.093333333333334
7937390,2,B00005BGRH,"I was really excited about receiving this, as the copy of Dimentia 13 I possessed is extremely washed out and terribly grainy in appearance. The first reviewer said the transfer was digitally remastered. Hello!!!!!??? This is obviously copied from a very bad 50th or so generation video tape, or a bad copy of the film, but NOT the master! Still, the movie is great for old 1960s horror. Too bad it looks like crap!
Vincent Price's, The Last Man On Earth, is a far superior digital transfer!  Stay away from this washed out macabre mess. Carnival of Souls, another great 60s horror flick, is a bit more tolerable, yet hardly a pristine digital transfer. Still, it is watchable. Be wary of the quality of this DVD ""digital transfer""",1405296000,,731,4.7109375

7937393,3,B00005BGRH,"I really ordered this dvd for Dementia 13. Carnival of Souls is ok, but not great. Dementia 13 on the other hand still packs a punch. It's pretty creepy and would be a great to watch on Halloween night.",1251244800,,202,4.205128205128205
7937394,5,B00005BGRH,"If you want to add two of the most famous classic horror films to your library I recommend this DVD.

Carnival of Souls is absolutely haunting and totally creepy. It is amazing how much better this film is than many of the slasher films put out today.

Dementia 13 is the perfect marriage for Carnival. It too has a haunting story with a creepy atmosphere. While no Godfather it is certainly a CLASSIC.

Both prints are very nice and the studio has done a great job here in the marrage of the two films.",1118880000,,503,4.329787234042553

7937396,1,B00005BGRH,"I buy many DVD's form these smaller companies(Marengo, VCI, Roan and Platinum disc).  I was satisfied with the transfers on this Marengo disc when I had nothing to comapare it to, but Platium Disc has much better transfers of both these movies.  With Platium Disc you have to buy two DVD's.  On one you get a great transfer of Carnival(plus 3 other movies).  On the other you get a good transfer of Dementia(plus 3 other movies).  You even save about three dollars.",1107302400,5,465,4.621951219512195
7937397,5,B00005BGRH,"Marengo Studios had good sense to put these two black and white films together.  The transfer is excellent as they both are digitally remastered.
Carnival Of Souls with Candace Hilligoss as church organist, Mary Henry, is a cult classic that was produced on a shoestring budget of $17,000.00 and was filmed in less than three weeks. Very creepy and nightmarish visuals with tons of suspension of disbelief scenes.
Dementia 13 is Francis Ford Coppolla's directorial debut. A great suspense filled horror film with creepy scenes that will delight.
Both of these films are highly recommended!
