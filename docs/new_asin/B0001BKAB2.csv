1986300,5,B0001BKAB2,"Very subtle but captivating screenplay throughout.  A magnificent portrayal of a woman's love that only could be brought by woman's heart. Devastatingly romantic story. I am quite impressed by the splendid talents of captivating leading casts, masterful director, screen writer and crew of those who made the creation of this Magnificent masterpiece possible. I would not call this movie a lesbian film. It deserves to be categorised as mainstream story of love and trust between women so beautifully and intimately portrayed

Since the beginning of civilisation philosophers, psychologists, many scholars and like had debated against the superiority of love that a woman can offer to all of man kinds (to both men and to women) . I personally view  that of women are definitely superior to the others. Since the majority of us do not experience temporary loss of vision or complete loss of consciousness due to the required depth of sedation for major surgery such as open heart or open skull procedures.  These procedures can cause tremendous trauma to your psyche.  It is not unusual for patient and nurse to develop an almost like loving attachment to each other from the moment the nurse transfers you from a rolling bed to a recovery bed, then calling your name and caressing you as if rescuing you from desolated realm of unconscious.  If you compare it with the same task performed by male surgical assistants at operating room ,you will be impressed with the fact that a woman's love is a priceless enlightenment.  It is highly likely that someone like Ellen had finally awakened from a life-long repression to that enlightenment by following her own heart. Every female child has dreams of being swept up into a great adventure, of being the beautiful princess. Lamentably, when women grow up, they are often swept up into a life filled merely with demands, duty and responsibility. Many women are tired, struggling under the senseless pressure to be of a faithful servant, or a caregiver for children, husband or father and like. If Chen An had realised that demands from her father were unreasonable, the both girls could have survived. I have known an award winning blind female writer and her nurse companion who helped her publishing her novels until the end of writer's life age 72. The nurse died next summer found afloat on River Kamo during Gion Festival (Buddhist Spiritual season) leaving a will to be buried next to the writer. In fact I have seen them twice together on the bridge across a pond within the property of an ancient Buddhist temple in 1970's. Nurse were eyes to the writer and describing everything that the nurse can see. The both women looked very beautiful radiating the glory of love between them. They both were descendant of ancient noble families go back to 11th century and their presence seemed to enhance the tranquillity of the mid-autumn setting.  I could not help but wishing their happy union forever from the moment I saw the strength and intensity of woman's love. I am straight male, However, it has forever changed my attitude about woman's love. So let's wish the two women best luck and let them pursue their happiness!

1986302,5,B0001BKAB2,"There are not many movies I can truely say that have made me cry a little tear.  This movie has done this.  Although I am not old enought to remember that far back in time, I have managed to find friends that have told me of days long ago.  Through their vision and movies like this I have grown to have a greater appreciation of where we are today.  We must look to the future with the knowledge derived from the past.",1181347200,2,419,4.073170731707317
1986303,3,B0001BKAB2,"This is a quietly told story of a woman exisitng in a loveless marriage, raising a son she cherishes, and trying to manage the balance in her gloom.  She finds love in the companionship of her son's teacher, and we witness the slow simmer of her life opening in the direction of that woman.  The dreariness of factory working middle class families in England lends reality.  The dialogue is spoken with great economy; some of the movie is spent on scenes that could have been shortened (too many minutes of footage of walking to and from work etc) in favor of more time with the two women together.  The confession of the wife to the teacher is SO heart wrenching and tender!  No sex scenes, just the story of the discovery of women falling in love with each other told in a subtle and low keyed way.",1170547200,22,800,4.414965986394558
1986304,5,B0001BKAB2,"I hadn't heard anything about this film before watching it and was very pleasantly surprised. Between Two Women is a nice romance set in post-WWII Northern England. Ellen (Barbara Marten) has lived in the same industrial mill town all of her life, surrounded by the constant noise of steam engines and a dire working class existence.

She and her dull husband have grown apart, but when their son Victor's (Edward Woodcock) teacher begins taking a special interest in his artistic abilities, Ellen's life also becomes more interesting. Soon the meetings are about Ellen and the younger Kathy (Andrina Carroll) and their growing friendship and love.

Ellen struggles with issues of duty to her marriage and parents, and working towards her own real happiness for the first time in her life. The journey is not an easy one, but she summons the courage to follow her heart.

Barbara Marten's performance as Ellen is wonderfully compelling, and the film is a lovely romance between two very real characters in the 1950s.",1115769600,50,1016,5.0
1986305,3,B0001BKAB2,"Overall, this is great movie which takes place in the 1950's in Northern England...The young boy stays after school all the time while his mother gets aquainted with his teacher ( Miss Thompson )...Eventually the teacher resigns and moves away and ends up writing to the boys mother and it isn't until then that she realizes that she is in love with Miss Thompson...The ending of the movie I didn't think was that great because it really left some things unanswered...The mother ended up taking her son and leaving her husband to be with Miss Thompson and the movie ended with just showing the mother and son on the train on their way to begin their new life...If you are looking for something with any deep passionate scenes you won't find it in this movie...I personally thought it was going to have more romance than what it did to it which was why I bought and because I like dramas as well, but the most it ever got to was just holding hands and a hug...I found it kind of disapointing but yet still a good movie...",1099353600,33,1020,4.459893048128342

1986341,4,B0001BKAB2,"The wife/mothers face will grip you at every turn. The painful existence of living with a husband/man who smokes, is subconsciously angry, and emotionally selfish is written all over this movie. The son slowly melts away with each interaction with his father. The obvious love between the two women is so driven and powerful that even if you are against the gay lifestyle, you desperately want them to run away together and raise the son in a healthy environment so the son can thrive and grow to be everything he can be in a loving environment. Funny thing is, the son actually knows on some level his mother loves a woman and seems to indirectly support her happiness. The ending where husband/father accepts that fact that the marriage is over is so incredibly satisfying that can't wait for him to get on with it and walk out the door.

Every emotion that crosses her face plays true.  One is likely to Thank the Gods times have changed, note where they haven't and feel a solid empathy. Affecting in several ways as it speaks to archetype and human desire on all levels.

The British excel at this type of film. I suppose they've a lot of experience in the powerful expectation to conform and the price of not.  There is a happy ending, even if just alluded to after all the teeth gnashing and wishing someone would throw the husband out the window. She finds love in both the other woman and in her son especially via his acceptance and even eagerness for mom to be happy. Worth the time. My opinion.

1986393,4,B0001BKAB2,"It was ok, a little slow at times, but thought provoking nonetheless. The tenderness and growing love between two women set in northern England is heart wrought.

1986394,5,B0001BKAB2,"Attraction to the same sex in the 1950s was considered a sin almost cardinal in nature, especially in England. This delicately crafted, fine line approach to said ""sin"" portrays the emotional conflict of a mother's need for something more than her husband's insensitivity opposed to adherence to repressive societal dictates.

She appear to know, at first, that her friendship is actually more, that it is headed for more emotionally intimate a connection. As it becomes apparent, also becoming apparent is the dysfunction of her marriage.

The movie begins grey and miserable and ends with light and promise. I personally am grateful to those women of that era for paving the path to emotional self-esteem and self-worth.",1438214400,,722,5.2155172413793105

This version is a ridiculous, insulting, watered-down version of the original English release, in which a key part (maybe THE key part) of the entire film has been absurdly removed. Had I known (or figured out; mea culpa) this was the Americanized version, I would have never spent the money on it. So, buyer beware: find the ORIGINAL version of the movie, and spend your money on it instead of this soulless version of one of the best movies in the genre.",1436572800,10,521,4.553191489361702

The end, while moving is a bit of a 'cop out'..just a kiss would have been nice..but given the time frame it's set in maybe not.",1397174400,,395,4.410958904109589

They didn't even get to kiss. I saw the Hulu version so I might have missed some parts. Hulu cuts parts off (rip off).
Nevertheless, it is right their next to Heavenly Creatures and other lesbian classics. Definitely recommended.",1373587200,,462,4.646341463414634
1986411,5,B0001BKAB2,"Set in England in the 1950s, unhappily married Ellen (Barbara Marten) becomes friends with her son Victor's schoolteacher, Kathy Thompson (Andrina Carroll) when she picks him up after class each day. As Miss Thompson encourages Victor's talent for painting and sketching, the women find even more reason's to spend time together.

Regardless of the disapproval of Ellen's husband Geoff (Andrew Dunn), the women's friendship continues and eventually grows into love. In the end, Ellen must choose between her marriage and her desire for the woman she has fallen on love with.

British writer/director Steven Woodcock weaves a compelling tale of romance amid a background of small town industrial Britain. The story is told in a simple matter a fact way that makes the women's falling in love seem very natural.

Barbara Marten's portrayal of working-class mother Ellen Hardy struggling against her feelings for another woman is heartfelt and believable. This is a wonderful story, of a slow gradual falling in love but not much in the way of physical contact between the women.

1986412,5,B0001BKAB2,This movie is quite old but not dated. The actors are excellent and the performances are nuanced and sensitive. I really enjoyed this movie and the Northern English setting.

1986413,5,B0001BKAB2,"This film is just marvelous in it's depiction of two women who fall in love, in post-war Britain, by way of their mutual association with the one woman's gifted son. It is rare for an actor to convey such depth of feeling and conflicted emotions to such an amazing degree as Barbara Marten does in this film. The rest of the cast is quite perfect, but Ms Marten is a wonder to behold. Her face is so expressive it draws one in to the point of feeling personally involved in the story.

This film is about emotional connections, not the sexual. I felt voyeur enough seeing some of the raw emotion displayed. So, bravo and 5 stars given to this gem of a film. I could write a great deal about this film but don't wish to spoil it for others.",1356393600,7,739,4.24113475177305
1986414,3,B0001BKAB2,"This is a lesbian movie made for straight people.  It doesn't cross any lines that will make them uncomfortable.  It's slow paced, like many British movies.  A mother comes to be friends with a teacher when the teacher shows an interest in the son's artistic ability.  Things start slowly and remain slow.  The women come to realize they have feelings for each other and decide what they want to do.  As to interaction between the characters, they could have been deciding to be best friends.  The movie was OK, but I kept getting distracted by emails and other things.  It just didn't hold my attention.",1316217600,,604,4.685714285714286

8009719,2,B0001BKAB2,"Glad to read that the movie I just tried to get through was some sort of hacked up version of a better movie. Something I must have missed was the plot. Maybe it didn't have any, and I guess that's okay for an art film. I figured I was just a philistine, but glad to read that wasn't the case and the plot was somehow edited out. Essentially what you have here is a still image of depressing scenery, oppressive lives, hopelessness... absolutely no light shines through this downer of a film, and it doesn't get better. Okay, maybe there's about 30 seconds all together that shows promise, but that's a lot of time wasted just for 30 seconds. Oh the music, if that's what you can call it, will have you chugging the vodka after the millionth repetition of the same two, minor-key chords played over and over again on some kind of funeral parlor, sounding pipe organ. If that is art... call me a philistine, cuz I just don't get it.",1494806400,2,931,4.38728323699422
8009720,3,B0001BKAB2,"First, I'd give this film five stars if it were the original version. I adored the original version. I have it on DVD.  This mutilated thing is Woodcock's idea of a Director's Cut. Woodcock set out to make a film about a woman and a man but quickly realized it wouldn't work in the time period, so he made both characters women. It was a lovely, understated film. Then, he wrote a book and changed the story slightly (added a second and very young child)...adding more difficulties as if they didn't have enough. Somewhere along the line, he decided the footage with the major character development in the film was boring or he wished he'd told a different story. I won't give it away because it's some of the best scenes in the film. He removed them.....19 minutes of them. He left us with 1:19 minutes. He then said anyone wanting that scene could read it in the book. Instead of labeling this ew version as the Director's Cut, he just released it in place of the original as if nothing had changed (a' la George Lucas?). Well, the book is now out of print.

The sad thing about this to me was that it revealed to me that he truly didn't understand the story he'd told or the audience he'd chosen by switching to a lesbian story. That footage was key, and the film suffers drastically without it. I've often wondered if he did it to diminish the lesbian aspect and draw more attention to Hardy's character who is played by one of his best friends. Since this version was released, his company seems to have closed its doors. Sadly, that means the original version is lost to a lot of viewers would have loved it. As a huge film buff, I will never forgive him. Its one thing to release a version with additional scenes but to chop it up and leave your audience with less and then remove access to the original is just mindboggling....and oddly similar to what Lucas tried to do when releasing only the ""improved"" SW versions on Blu-ray. If I'm honesy, I'm mot sure which one of them I dislike more.

Save yourself the trouble and don't watch this film unless you can find the verson that exceeds 1:30 in length.",1487289600,7,2112,4.438144329896907
