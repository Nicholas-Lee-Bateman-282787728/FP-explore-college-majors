*Plot and ending analyzed*

Patrick Still Lives could have been an interesting concept, but it is a tedious bore since they do nothing with the premise.  It is an Italian horror film, so they ripped someone off, the case being here, Patrick (1978) from Australia.  Patrick (1978) was a creepy film I remember.  Patrick Still Lives says it is a sequel, but don't be mislead.  It is a padding time of one hour and a few nude scenes and horror scenes with green eyes superimposed on the screen.  That's pretty much it.  Even the nudity can't carry this boring film.

The corny premise is that a doctor, whose son, Patrick, who got tagged by someone in a car with a bottle, is out for revenge.  He invites some dull people to a villa where he has three living specimens on tables who are engaging Patrick, who is on another bed, with psychical energy.

The problem with the film is that nothing happens at all, the people talk us to death, and there's no sense of horror at all.

Patrick (2013) was even worse, substituting the boring scenes with boring CGI images.",1477872000,,1103,4.515151515151516

7978551,3,B000083C6T,"Patrick (Gianni Dei) while standing along side of the road gets red liquid thrown in his face and goes into a lifetime coma. He is treated by his father Dr. Hershel (Sacha Pitoff) at a private vacation villa and hospital. Five guests show up in the off season. The doctor has his coma patients connected to a large machine with a meter with red and green lights that plays 50's eerie sci-fi music. Patrick is able to control people and things through his super imposed eyes (see DVD cover) . Visitors are killed by Patrick and bad special effects.

This is the Italian film that the later 2013 blockbuster ""Patrick"" was based upon, although they give it no credit. As far as a horror film goes, the newer English version is far superior. However if gratuitous nudity is what you crave this one smokes the new one. I saw the general release edition which used any inane way to get a nude scene. There is an uncut version available that I haven't seen, although I can't imagine there be much more than the full frontal nudity already in this one.

Not much of a sci-fi horror. 3 stars for the nudity (Mariangela Giordano, Carmen Russo, Anna Veneziano, Andrea Belfiore)",1408665600,,1166,4.574162679425838

BUT....if you are into hot Italian 80`s style woman,and love cool gore effects from the era,then look no further! Patrick Viva Ancora baby! My only issue all these years was how Media Blasters chose to market this gem. Why in gods name would you make 2 different versions?!Their customers were only there to purchase these cult movies for the best quality prints AND the totally un-cut versions period. You wonder why today there are thousands of the ""general release"" versions available and very few ""un-cut versions"".I bet they lost their behinds on that business decision and it went against the grain of what they were standing for. Anyhow,thats my opinion. Only people in the know or ones that got word of mouth will ever buy this movie. I got addicted to crazy Italian horror movies in the 90`s. Would have been sooner,but the video stores where I grew up in the 80`s never carried any of it and there was no internet. Anyway,if these type movies are your bag,dive in head first and go Un-cut version all the way! Just don`t get price raped too bad!",1400284800,,1157,4.676470588235294

7978556,4,B000083C6T,"""Patrick vive ancora"" (""Patrick Still Lives"") from 1980 was directed by Mario Landi. After the sleaze-fest shocker in the hard to find ""Giallo a Venezia"" 1979, Mario Landi followed that one up with his own version of ""Patrick"" (the 1978 Australian movie about a comatose telekinetic). Mario Landi was far from being a good filmmaker, but what he lacked in cinematic skills, this dirty old-man made up in other ways! And this is where ""Patrick vive ancora"" excelled, in the sleaze and shock-factor (it's actually so far-fetched that it's unintentionally funny!). The wooden and campy acting along with the script was a complete joke! If you don't find yourself laughing at some of the ridiculous lines in this turkey, you may want to check your pulse! The reason I'm giving this one 4 stars is plainly obvious. All the female personnel (4) took their clothes-off (FFN), and not just for a couple of seconds but for a good percentage of the time! With the likes of: Carmen Russo, Andrea Belfiore (who played 'Lydia' but was uncredited for some strange reason), Ana Veneziano and everyone's favorite Mariangela Giordano, who actually looked like she enjoyed every minute of her celluloid state-of-undress. I won't spoil any of the film for you with unnecessary details, but this is the complete uncut version you want to own. The DVD picture quality from Shriek Show is excellent. NTSC, Italian with English subtitles, NR 92 mins.

Love and Peace,

7978557,2,B000083C6T,"Well I had heard this was a pretty sleazy film and it's all true, but it's also very daft and not at all believable. A young man gets attacked by an unseen assailant and spends the rest of the film in a coma. From his bed he uses telekinesis to murder a group of people, all of whom have come to visit a luxury guest house in answer to a mysterious letter.

The script is sparse to the point of being nonsensical - whoever wrote the screenplay must have simply jotted down the various death scenes and then given the characters various random things to do and talk about to fill in all the gaps. The death scenes are clearly where the money went anyway, and they are pretty severe, although maybe they just seem that way because the rest of the movie is so dull. If you have heard of this film at all, it is undoubtedly by way of it's most famous scene in which a nearly-naked woman is impaled by a poker that goes right through her, entering between her open legs and emerging through her mouth. Its very graphically filmed, and even though it's not realistic in the slightest, the overall effect is suitably disgusting. But watch out also for the other deaths, by a hook through the neck, gassing, drowning in boiling water, and a car window decapitation that's actually pretty nifty. The other thing this movie really delivers is a huge amount of nudity, mostly female of course, and some of it is very explicit.

So if you like lots of naked female flesh and a few crazy murder scenes, you could be very happy with this. What you won't get, though, is any decent story, acting or atmosphere. The concentration is so blatantly on keeping the female cast members naked that it becomes almost farcical, as every single one of the ladies (guests and house staff alike) spends half her screen time falling out of her clothes or not even bothering to put any on, which might sound titillating, but it starts to look ludicrous after the third or fourth time, and it isn't even very attractively filmed. A real rushed job. I can't think of many films that truly live up to the tag of ""exploitation"" as much as this one does.",1167350400,5,2120,4.433333333333334
