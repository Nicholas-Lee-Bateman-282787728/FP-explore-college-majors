seen.  I have played many gigs for many different occasions and events but could never really feel that I was producing a professional sound.  I ordered and studied his book, Play the Piano In A Flash, and am still amazed at what can be accomplished in one short week.  His approach to a single note treble cleft and bass chords really work if applied correctly and if you have any music ear at all, you can pick it up very quickly.",1266192000,,515,4.333333333333333
