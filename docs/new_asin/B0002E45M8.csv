I believe anyone would come to the same conclusion if they put it to the test.  Train any method with a friend till you have it down. Now the friend gets a marker and you wear old clothes or get clothes from a thrift store. Your friends job is to mark you up as much as possible while you do the technique you learned. Then trade roles.  If the person with the marker is using even a little effort, you will be shocked how many marks are on you.

The last 13 minutes have better advice:
1. Avoid the situation.
2. Give them your wallet or whatever.  No ""thing"" is worth serious injury or death.
3. Run away.
4. Have a weapon in your hand or pick one up.

If you study the same martial art and you want to learn the techniques, this video may be worth watching. But if you want self defense, it is more likely to get you hurt. The best information in the video is the numbered list in this review.

If you want better advice, get the AttackProof book on Amazon (out of print, available used) or the AttackProof videos. Some are on Amazon, others you can find on the AttackProof web pages.",1421452800,,1193,4.183406113537118

8027098,4,B0002E45M8,"The martial art that I teach is Hapkido.  I am always looking for new DVD's that instruct in certain self defense methods.  As usually with most of the DVD's on the market, some of the techniques are applicable to the street and some simply will not work. This is the case with this DVD. This is not a DVD for the beginner, but for the more advanced student. If you know the art then you will be able to pick and choose the techniques that work. As for the instruction - it is excellent. The technique is rerun several times and then in slow motion and explained.  Would I recommend it for the advanced martial art student - yes.",1209254400,5,629,4.26890756302521
8027099,4,B0002E45M8,"I have trained in the martial arts for 18 years. I have the rank of 4th Dan black belt. This video is good it has many joint locks,throws and take-downs used on a knife welding opponent. Many of the attacks are front stabs. There are other angles someone can strike you. Toward the end of the video you will learn how to get out of positions that would be someone's worst nightmare. Like someone who has you on the ground standing over you with a knife to your through. The list could go on there are so many techniques.  I don't see this as a end all video, but I did skip the first one in the series. I do recommend this video, and it does live up to the it's name Advanced Knife Defense.",1104278400,9,690,4.111111111111111
