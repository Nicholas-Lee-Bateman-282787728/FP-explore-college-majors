I guess I prefer symphony music or caroling over the instrumentals offered on this tape.

I am a Christmas nut, but this did nothing for me.",1132704000,,293,4.2727272727272725
8472953,4,B00004ZBP2,"I have never written a review on this site before but feel compelled to write this one. A few weeks ago I purchased all three videos of this series. I was a little uneasy about buying anything online but did so anyway, and I'm VERY pleased that I did. I am going to buy all three Crackling fire tapes again as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. These videos are just great to read my books by, its like having a real fire! I would recommend them.",975110400,7,450,4.067415730337078
