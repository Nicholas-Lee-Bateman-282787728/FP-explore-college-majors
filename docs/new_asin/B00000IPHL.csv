7911207,5,B00000IPHL,"I enjoy this movie and watch it often.  My VHS tape was getting worn; therefore, I ordered this in a new format.

Acting is very well done with just the right emotion in the right spots with excitement and romance.",1162857600,2,214,4.325
7911208,1,B00000IPHL,"Mother and daughter Barbara and Megan Brennan, played respectively by Michele Lee and Justine Bateman, on holiday in Paris, are engaged in the customary activities of tourists there: climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower, boating upon the Seine, etc., with Megan capturing their activities with a video camera; when she mischievously films a couple passionately embracing at a construction site, she unwittingly records a murder and the killer, having spotted Megan's camera actions, pulls out all stops to find her in order to take possession of the damning tape.  This is an intriguing basis for a scenario, but this internationally financed co-production droops hopelessly into weak melodrama as the script with its hackneyed dialogue is full of inconsistencies in logic and continuity, direction is flaccid, particularly of the featured players, and post-production dubbing and looping are flawed.  Despite all of this, some excellent production values are in evidence, enhanced by appropriate scoring from Michel Colombier and the able cinematography of Jean-Yves Le Mener.  A solid performance is given by Franois Dunoyer as a police detective and the splendid actress Sonia Petrovna garners acting honours with a skilled albeit largely wasted turn as a genuine femme fatale.  For this low-budget affair, the DVD and VHS versions are identical.",1114041600,4,1352,5.454545454545454
7911209,3,B00000IPHL,"Takes place in Paris.  Mom and daughter seeing sights - sees too much. Unfortunately they were seen back. Filmed in Paris.  Acting was well done.  Michelle is skilled at playing the normally placid lady who when pushed too far, pushes right back.  Would rate it higher if the production company had made better copies.  The film was contrasted dark and the speech did not match the movement of the lips.  Still in all, an excellant film.",1036886400,5,437,4.684210526315789
