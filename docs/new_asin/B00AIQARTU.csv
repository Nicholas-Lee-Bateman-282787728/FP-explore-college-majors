5435418,2,B00AIQARTU,Would have rated it higher if one of the DVD's wasn't defective. I guess for the price I can't complain & at least the other DVD worked,1375574400,,135,4.037037037037037
5435419,5,B00AIQARTU,"I was looking to purchase both of these movies and so when I saw they were together I was so excited! Usually when two movies are in the same packaging, they are also on the same disc, but these were both on their own disc which I liked. Hilarious movies!",1372636800,,255,4.12

8552226,1,B00AIQARTU,"Poor quality, cheaply made with both movies on one Blu Ray. These are about DVD quality for video on both movies, with grainy quality. The audio is totally screwed up on Wedding Singer. Running through my 7.2 home theater system, Wedding Singer audio for dialogue, which should come specifically from the center channel, instead mainly comes from the left front speaker, with a little less volume of the dialogue from the center channel. The right front speaker and the surround speakers have little to no audio present. Just a terrible, cheap-o combo disc.",1484352000,,557,5.0

8552228,4,B00AIQARTU,"These Movies are classics and at a price that makes them seem even better. Delivery was fast and timely and was in new condition. Amazon gets 5 stars.
The Movies themselves are a mixed bag in quality. Wedding Crashers is fine, but wedding singer is a lil different. Video is ok but audio is all over the place. It feels mixed by a drunken wedding singer with whisper quiet dialog loud back ground music and thundering yelling. Its a hold on to the remote kinda flick. If you have a audio reciever take a second and turn on the dynamic range control setting to even out this audio rollercoaster. Without help it will have u leaning in to hear conversation and scrambling for the volume control at its peak. Billy Idol shouldve been more involved. LOL!",1482019200,,750,4.522058823529412
