5324767,5,B009G5C8Q4,"Every person I've met so far has made it clear that you either love Jersey Shore or you really hate it and can't figure out why anyone would waste their time with this, (and I'm going to be nice, and politically correct, etc, because as you see, I have 5 stars up there) TRASH.

Well, occasionally I can fall into both of those categories on a subject.

I'm much older than the demographic that would pay for this stuff.  However, I also happen to have purchased all 6 seasons on DVD AND I watch it on Amazon.
I've seen every episode many times.  If I had children at home I would FORBID them to watch this, and would not allow it in my house.  Nor would I allow DISCUSSION of it in my house.
It is TRASH, and quite frankly, if The Situation weren't involved at all, I would appreciate JS much more.  But then again, he's such a bad person and such a violent antagonist, that MTV couldn't possibly have had the same success with this series without him.  It wouldn't have happened.
My opinion is that he really is evil though, no amount of counseling could ever make him a real human being.  So I hate the show for it's immaturity, irresponsibility, grandiose self-entitlement, complete lack of subject matter, and a couple of people that for the life of me, I can't understand how they have a friend in the world, but..................I can't stop watching it man....I can't stop.  I guess it's MY soap opera even though I am embarrassed to admit that.  By the same token I'll TELL people, that I'm ashamed and embarrassed, but that I still continue to love it and watch it.

Snooki and JWOWW is even better.  (I also really hate how much money this cast has made off this show, but I also seem to accept that as well.  It's one of those shows that HOOKS you, or you swim right on by without a peep.)  I MUST BE CRAZY.",1428710400,2,1819,4.34319526627219

Also, lots of funny scences, epic fails, etc. If you keep an open mind, and laugh with the guidos (c'mon with all the HATERs already) you'll truly get a laugh & even some good advice from Vinny. Watching the show, you can also see what NOT to do, but get to laugh at others that will! The few serous scenes are moving (Snooki Punch, my fav Ronnie's K.O. Etc) and there is more to this show than just GTL. I highly recommend it & WISH for a spin-off (NOT SEPERATLEY) or just bring back JERSEY SHORE!

Sammi is sweet and seems innocent but clueless and has NO self esteem to be putting up with Ron.  Ron is not too bright and should NEVER drink but can't seem to figure that one out, guess cause he is not the sharpest tool in the shed.  Vinny seems to be good at heart and trying to play a tough guy going overboard to prove it by doing OMG way off the wall sex events and laughing about it afterwards.  Pauly D thinks he is so all that that every girl that isn't skin and bones is a ""grenade"" and Mike is a complete loose cannon however now we know most probably came from his drug addiction and heavy drinking on top of that.  Hopefully he might turn out to be a decent human being not that he is clean and sober...to be seen.

Geezzzz, having fun, going to the club, living each day for the next ""conquest"". This is what memories are made of, and living proof that not all endeavors have to be cerebellar. Some times drunk and simple is great fun, and I love Jersey shore for that very reason.

I've lived that life, it was great, and I like to see that (after college) there's still people who love living life, and having a great time.
Glad to see that Ron and ""Sweet-e-pie"" have come to grips with each other and there's not as many highs and lows.

On the down side, Jersey Shore is a perfect example of how alcohol and jealousy, can create a real personal problems. LOL..  As in meat ball madness.......It also seems that a few of the cast might want to take Mikes example, and kind of back off on being drunk EVERY day....LOL...LOL.. Young budding alcoholics.

Why people would want to watch this mindless drivel is way beyond me. I did it by accident when I was browsing Amazon one day. It was the first and probably last Amazon instant video I will ever watch. Oh well it was FREE! I watched like 2 mins of it then shut it off!
