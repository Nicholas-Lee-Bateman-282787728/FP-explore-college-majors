8514102,3,B0033PSH2M,"My wife and I like movies with quircky characters that are pretty much the opposite of Hollywood blockbuster special effects car chase vampire movies.  In other words, we like movies for adults who have passed the GED's, not movies aimed at pre-teens, teenagers or morons.  This movie started out with interesting characters and plot twists.  But then it started to just get gross.  We didn't make it quite to the end.",1365465600,,418,4.845070422535211

In both cases the movie is in Spanish with subtitles, I found it interesting that the translations were different between the two versions. In either case it is a very entertaining dark comedy with a twist in the middle that covers all the events twice from different perspectives. From my American perspective it is also interesting to see life in Chile, peopled with the same useless louts, emasculating girlfriends and closet psychopaths we have up here. Makes the world seem smaller somehow. A great movie I made my family watch and would highly recommend.",1330387200,2,653,4.7368421052631575
