8110721,4,B000EJXVKI,"The video is amateurial on content, story, quality and editing.
Probably a great memory for the author, though.
On the other hand, you you want a real demonstration on what it is to live the experience he lived, this DVD works and is for you!",1389916800,,242,4.4
8110722,4,B000EJXVKI,"A screening of Jimi Sir was part of a summer library series focusing on Nepal (related to a ""one book"" community read program on the book ""Little Princes"" by Conor Grennan).  The film was a great companion to the book since each tell the story of a young man making a difference to the people of Nepal.  The audience was appreciative of the insights into the life and culture of the villagers, enjoyed the scenery and felt they learned a little more about the country.  The film quality is like a home movie but it still satisfied the library audience.",1375228800,,552,4.5
8110723,5,B000EJXVKI,This is a wonderful video. It is an especially insightful look at working for the Peace Corp. I highly recommend it.,1304553600,,116,4.571428571428571
8110724,5,B000EJXVKI,"Jimi Sir is a must see for anyone with Peace Corps experience--past, present, or future--or who knows someone who served in the Peace Corps.  The film successfully captures the essence of Peace Corps experience: the various relationships with people who have become neighbors, friends, and almost-family; the ambiguities of negotiating cultural differences that don't seem so odd except in trying to explain them; the joy of the daily experiences as well as the challenges in doing things that are so different from what was once the ""normal""; and the bittersweet experience of leaving a community that is home.  The portrayal was so evocative that, at times, it seemed as though the events being portrayed were from my Peace Corps experience; however, in the film, the country and the volunteer had been changed.

What an experience!",1303689600,,834,5.162962962962963
8110725,5,B000EJXVKI,"This video is of course free to view on jimisir.com.  I bought a copy so that I could carry it with me and show to people.  It's a great look into the life of a Peace Corps Volunteer in the early 1980's who is finishing the last 6 weeks of his 2 years of service.  Jimi's friend comes to visit with a camcorder and films him working on projets, teaching math, science, and english, and even captures some talking heads scenes.  Jimi is straight forward about how Peace Corps has changed his perspectives on life, poverty, America, and development.  This video is worth the watch, just to see the beautiful landscapes of Napal.  You'll feel jealous of his adventure, even as he lives without electricity or running water.

It's a great movie and a great picture of what the Peace Corps was like when it was a mere 20 years old.",1302220800,,826,4.430463576158941
8110726,1,B000EJXVKI,When I first ordered this movie it didn't work in my DVD player. An error sign came up on the screen. I sent it back and received another copy which did the exact same thing. I'm not sure whether it was both DVDs that didn't work or my DVD player. The DVD player has never done anything like this with any other DVD though.,1190851200,,323,4.0625
8110727,5,B000EJXVKI,"Innocent, brave and fantastic account of a young PC volunteer in his last few weeks of stay in Nepal. James is on his way out but his heart will remain in Melung! I had an similar experience to Parks' story. I too served in the PC and indeed it is an irreplaceable experience by all measures and never a long vacation from home.",1172016000,2,328,4.222222222222222
