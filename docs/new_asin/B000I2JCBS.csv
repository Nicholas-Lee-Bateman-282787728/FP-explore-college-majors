8143793,5,B000I2JCBS,"Jean-Luc Godard was always doing things differently, or to put it in his own words, ""doing the same thing each time but differently."" (from an interview feature on the BAND OF OUTSIDERS disc). The aesthetics of A MARRIED WOMAN's direction are lovely. Although the plot can seem quite ordinary and the characters can seem one-dimensional, the narration placed against contrasting storyboards is where the real depth is found.

I can definitely understand why A MARRIED WOMAN isn't a film for everyone, but I think it's quite worth the time to experience films that take a very different route from the cliche Hollywood formula.",1464220800,3,626,5.077669902912621
8143794,2,B000I2JCBS,"A Married Woman,"" directed by Jean-Luc Godard in 1964, focuses on Charlotte (Macha Meril), a young married woman who is having an affair with actor Robert (Bernard Noel) even though she is still in love with husband Pierre (Philippe Leroy). When she discovers that she is pregnant, she has to decide which man is the father and which man she will stay with. Complicating the situation: both men want to have a child with her.

Charlotte may be going through an identity crisis, but her character is so vapid and surface that its puzzling what Robert and Pierre see in her apart from her outward beauty. Its tough to empathize with so dull a character. The pace is deadeningly slow, made tedious by pretentious narration, unnecessary interludes, and a parade of Charlottes mundane activities. Godards camera work and editing choices are interesting, but these characters are simply too ordinary for us to become engrossed.

The film is in French, with English subtitles. Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include 2010 interviews with French fashion designer and film producer Agnes B., Godard, scholar Antoine de Baecque, and star Macha Meril; and 2015 re-release trailer.",1463961600,2,1175,5.082901554404145

Jean-Luc Godard

A sensual farce in which Charlotte, the beautiful young wife of Pierre, must decide whom she will stay with -  her possessive husband or her lover, Robert, an actor who appeals to her deep attraction to the present and its fleeting pleasures.  Both men want to give her a child. Unknown to either, one of them has already succeeded.

The pleasures of love are beautifully framed in extensive love scenes, stylized close-ups of body parts - bare hands, legs, stomachs and heads - engaged in tender pre- or post-coital caress, often against a canvas of unpatterned bed sheets and walls. It is in these moments that Charlotte seeks to grasp the ineffable and uncontrollable vitality of the present

Political and social critical themes, whose treatment in some of Godard's films make for challenging viewing, emerge in AMW but are subordinate to plot, character development and generous visual allure. The view of the male-female relationship (at least, within the bounds of traditional conjugal relations in 1960's France) focuses lightly but unsentimentally on the deceit, jealousy and violence inherent in it.

Charlotte is aware of her basic relationship of subordination to both men, but she has no thoughts of rebellion.  The absence of afterthought is her strength. Contradiction has no purchase within the space she creates for herself.

Don't be put off by the lengthy subtitle, which suggests a fragmented and perhaps unfinished work. This is a luscious, intelligent film whose nuanced view of the female condition can engage post-feminist thinking.",1217721600,3,1643,5.169811320754717
8143796,4,B000I2JCBS,"Contrary to the other reviewer's comments, this is actually a perfectly good DVD of Godard's early and much-overlooked film -- I wonder if he's actually seen this particular disc or is just basing his comments on the company's reputation in general. The print has some minor damage to it, as you'd expect of an unrestored b&w film from the 60s, but the transfer itself is perfectly good, lacking in the kinds of digital artifacts and mess-ups that sometimes creep into DVD transfers. This is the only DVD release of this excellent film, and it's without a doubt a good buy.

The film itself is of course wonderful, one of Godard's finest works from his peak period, and it's a shame that more people haven't seen it because of its low profile.",1172534400,7,743,4.67175572519084
8143797,1,B000I2JCBS,This manufacturer specializes in multigenerational prints-totally unwatchable. They also have a video of Godard's Le Gai Savior-I honestly cant's see most of the images. I think Amazon. Fr may have it-play it on your computer or get a cheap all regions player like Cyberhome.,1162944000,8,275,5.2727272727272725
