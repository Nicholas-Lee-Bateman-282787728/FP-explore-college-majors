1728213,5,B000068V9X,I hope they don't stop with the first season. I love the Jeffersons. This DVD is a classic.,1036972800,2,91,4.111111111111111
1728214,4,B000068V9X,"First let me begin by saying that making THE JEFFERSONS available in DVD format was a great idea. The early seasons may be my favorite seasons. I just loved Mother Jefferson, the show wasn't the same after the actress that played her passed away and her character was written out of the series. I grew up watching THE JEFFERSONS and have seen all the episodes so many times that I know practically all the lines for each episode. I've noticed that in recent years that tv stations, including TV LAND, delete a couple of minutes from each episode to make way for more commercials. This ticks me off!!! I can understand why movies that were made for the theater need to be trimmed down to accommodate commercials but why trim down a show that was made to be aired with commercials. Also, it seems that when airing THE JEFFERSONS that networks are working with old film. The broadcast picture is grainy. I find it difficult to watch the re-runs of this show due to it's trimmed content and grainy picture.
This DVD solves all these problems. It has a clear picture with good colors and IT HAS THE ENTIRE SHOW, at least for the first season. I hope they continue to release the remaining seasons. I've noticed that more and more shows are being released in season format. This is great!! I envision a day when I won't have to watch trimmed reruns of my favorite tv shows ever again.
Now for the complaint. While this DVD is cheaper than ALL IN THE FAMILY (season 1) which also has 13 episodes I think it could have been a little cheaper still considering it has no special features. I would be willing to pay the additional $'s to purchase a well put together package like the one done for THE MARY TYLER MORE SHOW (season 1). I think it would be great to have special features that included interviews with the remaining cast members. Let's face it none of the actors are spring chickens anymore. The actors & actresses that portrayed George, Lousise, Tom, Mr. Bentley, Florence and Ralph are all in their late 60's to early 80's. The actress that portrayed Helen has already passed on. Even the actress & actors that portrayed Jenny and Lionel (both of them) are in their 50's. The longer they wait to interview these people the more likely it is that they will not all be around to be interviewed. Also, the episodes don't play one after the other. When one episode is finished the DVD defaults to the menu screen. I would have like the option that would allow the viewer to watch all the episodes back to back. So while I would have liked to give this DVD a 5 star rating I had to deduct a star due to the lack of special features and additional features.
Lastly, for those who don't quite know all the words to the opening theme song the words are printed on the inside of the DVD cover.",1036627200,8,2788,4.447265625
1728215,5,B000068V9X,"One of the best shows of it's time!  It's a 2 disc set with 13 season one episodes.  Bare in mind the pilot is not included.  It seems that it's an All in the family episode, the 1st episode of the 6th season.  Despite this, the rest of them are hilarious.  Florence, the wise crackin' maid, is introduced for the first time and Mother Jefferson seems to be in every episode.  Mother Jefferson is my personal favorite as she always has something negative to say about Louise, except for one of the very few occurences when she sides with her on one episode.  Hopefully the rest of the seasons will follow.  If you loved The Jefferson you'll love them on DVD.  Get your copy and get "" Movin' on Up""",1034121600,10,697,4.3
1728216,5,B000068V9X,"The Jeffersons is one of the funniest shows ever made. I bought the Complete First Season from Amazon.com a few weeks ago, and I just love it. I hope that the other ten seasons are released on DVD. If you havne't seen the Jeffersons yet, then I suggest watching it.",1032307200,,265,4.32
1728217,5,B000068V9X,"The most successful spinoff in televison history is finally here on DVD ... The Jeffersons.  As most of you know, this show is a spinoff of another revolutionary television series, All in the Family which ran 11 seasons from 1975 - 1985.
This show, another from the Norman Lear vehicle, had some firsts on television ... a rich affluent black family, a racially mixed couple to name a few.  Isabel Sanford (a star on Broadway, now 85 years old) heads this lovely cast.  Sherman Hemsley stars as the jive talking George Jeffersons, Mike Evans is the ever funny Lionel (who was only around for the first four seasons), Franklin Cover is Tom Willis (Helen's white husband) and of course, Roxie Roker (Lenny Kravitz' mom who is Helen Willis, Tom's wife, the most outrageous in this show) and last but not least, Zera Cully who is Momma Jefferson (George's mommy, only around for the first four seasons who died in 1978) who hates Louise with a passion.
This DVD is the complete First Season with thirteen episodes in all but take note - the ""pilot"" episode does not appear as it was a episode of ""All in the Family"" entitled, ""the Jeffersons are moving on up"", as a sixth season series opener.  This was the ""pilot"" episode which Roxie Roker had a big afro, a treat for those who liked her and her son Lenny.
Otherwise, these thirteen episodes contained here are quite entertaining in its own right.  Episodes like ....
""A Friend in Need"", where George & Louise adapt to their posh digs by hiring a part time maid, which introduced us to Marla Gibbs, the no-nonsense Jeffersons' maid, Florence.
""Louise Feels Useless"", as she has trouble adjusting to the good life but she takes a job at the rival cleaning store.
""George's Family Tree"" has George thinking he is the king reflecting on a gift given to him by the Willis' which has him digging into his ancestry but Louise has a lesson for George.
""Lionel, The Playboy"", has Lionel taking full advantage of the good life by partying it all the time but Momma Jeffersons lays down the law on Lionel to get him back on track.
""Mr. Piano Man"", has George heading up a protest meeting by the tenants at his home but boasts his classy image by buying a grand piano to impress the building owners', which backfires.
""George's Skeleton"", has someone from George's past suddenly re-emerge only to blackmail George of money.  Lionel and Louise come to George's rescue.
""Lionel Cries Uncle"" has Louise' Uncle Ward visit with the men of the family see him as an ""Uncle Tom"", but Ward gives Lionel a few lessons in life he is not to forget.
""Mother Jeffersons Boyfriend"" has Momma Jefferson with a new man in her life.  On her birthday, they propose and want to move to Florida.  Louise couldn't be more happier but George tries to break the lovbirds up.
""Meet the Press"" has George bragging about how he got to the top but it is the Willis' who are hogging all the attention that gets George steaming mad.
""Rich Mans' Disease"" has George hiding his mysterious ulcer, amoungst other things from Louise as he is feeling down in the dumps.
""Former Neighbours"" has George inviting a big client to a big extravagent dinner at his home but when the former old lower class neighbours pay a visit, Geroge tries to hide his poor past from the big client.
""Like Father, Like Son"" has Lionel behaving much like his father, but George gets involved in a local election, which the ""race card"" is played with comic effect.
""Jenny's Low"" has Jenny being jealous of her returning globe-trotting brother because he is able to ""pass"" for white while she can't.
This DVD is very nicely packaged and includes a Series Guide Booklet and of course, the very famous lyrics to the shows' theme song, Movin' On Up, which is sung by Ja'Net DuBois who was in Good Times.
The Complete First Season as a whole is quite good.  The series opens nicely, disappointments were few (especially the ""Former Neighbours"" episode which I thought would have been the Bunkers of All in the Family) but ends with a downer with the ""Jenny's Low"" episode.
Despite that though, there are no extra feautures on this DVD but just having the show on DVD is ""Extra"" enough with the ""Feautures"" being presented in thirteen segments on your televison screen.

1728220,5,B000068V9X,"The Jeffersons is still one of the best comedies around. I would highly recommend it. The transfer is good. The question now is when are they releasing the rest of the episodes? Now that season one is out we want season 2, 3 and so on real soooon!

Mr. J and friends are great and are still movin' on up!!",1030320000,,326,4.030769230769231
1728221,5,B000068V9X,"With the release of the All in the Family: Complete Season 1 DVD set, the next logical step would be that series' most successful spinoff, The Jeffersons.  For those that don't know, the Jeffersons first started out as the next door neighbors of the Bunkers on All in the Family.  Actually, the original Lionel, son of George and Louise (Wheezy), played by Mike Evans (later the role would go to Damon Evans) appeared in the first episode, ""Meet the Bunkers"", as a friend of Mike Stivic, and became a recurring character.  Louise appeared for the first time in the final show of the first season, ""The first and last supper"" but without George (Sherman Hemsley), instead bringing his brother Henry (Mel Stewart) who would turn out to be a hilarious regular on the show.  George would not be introduced until season 4, in an episode called ""Henry's Farewell"", which I believe is Henry's last episode.  Anyway, the Jeffersons became so popular on the show that they left during the fifth season of All in the Family and started their own show in 1975.  Again, if you don't already know, the Jeffersons ""moved up"" to an upscale apartment complex in Manhattan where they hired a maid with an attitude, Florence (Marla Gibbs), and became friends (well at least Louise did) with their neighbors in the building, Tom & Helen Willis (Franklin Cover & Roxie Roker) and Mr. Bentley (Paul Benedict).  Other regulars on the show were Jenny Willis (Berlinda Tolbert), Mother Jefferson (Zara Cully), Ralph the Doorman (Ned Wertimer),and Charlie the Bartender (Danny Wells).  The Jeffersons, like All in the Family, is not only essential TV comedy, but its also a landmark, considering the controversial topics and attitudes dealt with on the show.  I have not seen the DVD set yet but I hope it is done better than the All in the Family set.  There is already evidence that it will be, considering The Jeffersons is being released as a reasonably priced two DVD set with 13 episodes as opposed to the 3 DVD higher priced All in the Family set (also with 13 episodes).  Anyway I complained enough about the All in the Family set in my review for that.  The Jeffersons: Complete First Season should include these episodes: (the pilot, ""The Jeffersons move up"", probably will not be included, seeing as it is considered an episode of All in the Family)
 1) A Friend in need
 2) George's family tree
 3) The good life is bad for Louise
 4) Lionel the playboy
 5) Mr. piano man
 6) George's skeleton
 7) Lionel cries uncle
 8) Mother Jefferson's boyfriend
 9) Meet the press
10) Rich man's disease
11) Former neighbors
12) Like father, like son?
13) Jenny's low
For more essential 70s sitcoms on DVD, look for the complete first season of Sanford & Son (Redd Fox) due out at the same time as The Jeffersons!",1027641600,22,2788,4.695473251028806
1728222,5,B000068V9X,"""The Jeffersons"" is the *BEST* show that was ever made. Sherman Hemsley (George Jefferson) and Marla Gibbs (Florence Johnston) is what made ""The Jeffersons"" such a hit in my opinion. Sherman Hemsley and Marla Gibbs are so funny. Marla Gibbs is fantastic as The Jeffersons wise cracking maid. Florence and George can't stand each other, which is one reason why they are so funny. The rest of the cast is also terrific. I can't wait untill The Complete First Season comes out on DVD. I hope that all seasons of ""The Jeffersons"" come out on DVD. George Jefferson is my idol.
Memorable Line From Season Two:
Florence is talking to George: ""Ask me how I got to work this morning.""
George: ""I know how you got to work. You flew over on your broom!""
To understand why the quote above is so funny you need to watch the show. In other words this show is a *CLASSIC* they don't make shows like this any more.",1026259200,4,898,4.448484848484848

1728331,4,B000068V9X,"Come on and spend the first season with George and Louise ""Weezy"" Jefferson in their Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan, New  York. They finally made it to a luxury apartment and the first season shows their challenges. There are plenty of laughs along with the Willises, Mother Jefferson, Flo Johnston, Lionel and Jenny, and Mr. Bentley of course.

The first season is only thirteen episodes long and the series proved to be a critical and fan favorite for decades. Isabel Sanford would be the first African American actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Leading Actress in a Comedy Series as Louise Mills Jefferson. Sherman Hemsley would be inducted into the Television Hall of Fame as well. The spinoff series was developed by the genius, Norman Lear. The Jeffersons were neighbors to the Bunkers in Queens, New York. Like his other series, the spinoff was a huge success on its own merit.

The series is well-done, acted, and casted brilliantly as an ensemble company. I especially love Zara Cully's Mother Jefferson who died during the series run. You have to love the interaction between George and Florence and the Willises as well. The series would go on for a decade and more if the network didn't cancel it.

I wished the DVD would have featured extra features like Norman Lear interview or interviews with the cast members. Sadly, the only cast members alive right now are Marla Gibbs, Berlinda Tolbert, and Damon Evans (second Lionel). This season features Mike Evans ( the original Lionel before he went off to work on ""Good Times""). Apart from that, it's a great series.",1438473600,2,1595,4.852941176470588

The N word was used in comedies like The Jeffersons and Sanford & Son. Everyone knew that Sherman Hemsley (George Jefferson), or Carol O'Conner (Archie Bunker, of All In The Family), were not bigots in real life, it was just a part they were playing in a sitcom. George had Weezy and Lionel, to try to talk some sense into him, and Archie had Edith, Mike (Meathead), and Gloria as the rational people in his family. In the case of Sanford and Son it was Lamont, Fred's son, who was always trying to get his father to be sensible. The combination of ignorance and levelheadedness played off of each other and the results were hilarious.",1433462400,,770,4.468085106382978

1728402,3,B000068V9X,"The 1970's were a particularly progressive time for the American sitcom. The Jeffersons is a brilliant lampoon - reverse racism run amuck and cleverly shielded by the veneer of comedy. You can say an awful lot about folks when you coat the pill with sweetness. The Jeffersons continue to delight and inform as they did back in the day. Great stuff to be had here. Unfortunately, like so many shows from the period, this one was shot on tape rather than film. The results are abysmally subpar; a picture riddled with color bleeding, fading, and a ton of video noise. I'm no expert here, but I do know that modern technology can alleviate - if not entirely remove - the inconsistencies that are glaring obvious herein.

Sony ought to have taken a more progressive approach to remastering these discs. Again, The Jeffersons would never look as good as a production shot on film based preservation materials. But color correction and balancing should have been applied. Ditto for DNR, used only to moderately reduce the level of video noise on virtually all of the patterned materials that creates distracting ringing halos around just about everything. I've graded this release for content and quality. If only on quality alone, it would have rated a single star.",1398297600,4,1260,4.88785046728972

1728405,5,B000068V9X,"The 70's and 80's produced many legendary sitcoms that are still re-run twenty to thirty years after they were first aired.  The Jeffersons belongs in the top handful of them.  It might be necessary to mention for anyone younger than me (I'm 36) that some of the language on this show could be found offensive given the way society's tolerance of a cerain word has evolved.  Today, the n-word is right up there with an f-bomb when it comes to shocking language, and is censored just as heavily on TV.  I saw a re-run not long ago and the word was replaced with a dubbed-in ""black boy"".  I'm not sure if that's much less offensive than the actual word, but nonetheless, the DVD's are uncensored in that regard.  And while use of that word was far more common when The Jeffersons was on, you still notice that it had instant shock value every time it was used on the show.  But the writers and actors knew exactly how to play it, getting huge laughs every time.

As funny as the non-p.c. material is, The Jeffersons is great for many more reasons than that.  The writing was hilarious, getting big laughs throughout entire episodes.  The acting was incredible.  George and Louise are two of the most well-played characters ever to appear on TV.  And the groundbreaking nature of the subject matter, from the language to inter-racial couples, gives it a socially historical quality that puts it ahead of most other shows.  The first season only has 13 episodes, but they can't be  missed.  All of the best characters are introduced; George and Weezy, Lionel and Jenny, Tom and Helen, Mrs. Jefferson, Bentley, and Ralph all appear in these episodes.  With this many characters, it was clear that The Jeffersons had a wide scope from the start.  This first season established it as an excellent show, and this is a great DVD set to have.",1376697600,2,1832,4.622291021671827

There's also George's delightful yet overbearing mother, who takes to Louise like a cat takes to a fish. Throw in a persistent doorman & a smart-alecky maid, & you have the makings of a great sitcom. George is happy to accept his newly found station in life, except for Louise, who has difficulty in warming up to her new environment at first, as evidenced in the first two episodes, one of which is titled ""Louise Feels Useless"", where she's bored with sitting around the apartment all day, so she insists to George that she get a job. The Jeffersons newfound wealth also creates problems for their son Lionel, who feels he doesn't have to continue his education or go to work in the episode ""Lionel The Playboy"". The best scenes in the early seasons of this wonderful sitcom involves the exchanges between Louise & Mother Jefferson, which are priceless. ""The Piano Movers"" is another classic & funny episode, as the movers manage to fit a grand piano in such a small, confined apartment with hilarious results! Norman Lear's Midas touch was all over the television airwaves throughout the 1970s, as he brought viewers three groundbreaking sitcoms that decade - ""All in the Family"", ""The Jeffersons"" & ""Diff'rent Strokes"", as these shows featured actors in unique situations. ""The Jeffersons"" proved so popular with viewers, that it finished in the Top Ten in ratings during its first several seasons, & would air for a total of 252 episodes over eleven seasons from 1975-1985. This first season of ""The Jeffersons"" is chock-full of classic moments, not to mention laughs, that it should be an all-essential purchase to add to your video library ASAP!

(or what no show since wants to do because, Heaven forbid, making use of ideas might allow people to think...)

and well casted too!  (though season 2 features a new Lionel, who takes some time getting used to...  but I digress.)

Entertaining and even educational at times; if only modern day television tackled such issues or at least attempted to incite awareness.

The DVD set is typical of Sony:  No extras, no commentaries, one episode too many squeezed into every disc, making the video compression more obvious.  But the video (overall) looks very good too; the only real problems being in the DVD authoring (compression).

Now the audio has been cleaned, but they had overdone it; the lower frequencies (bass) sounding rather muted.  (note:  Season 2 demonstrates season 1's audio problem nimbly as the menu uses the same menu as season 1 had; but its episodes had proper audio cleaning applied...  so, obviously, expect a season 2 review in the near future - it's mostly good! :)  )

And, as with most shows from the '70s, the epilogues at the end of the stories may or may not exist.  (so could these copies be syndie cuts?)

Recommended episodes:

1.  ""A Friend in Need"".  *****  The series starts with a bang as  Louise is convinced she needs a maid.  The series starts in top form.  And Louise quickly proves to be the most straight character of the ensemble piece; preferring to remain true to her roots and not be wanton or wasteful.  Great stuff!

3.  ""George's Family Tree"".  ***** George doesn't care about his ancestry - until he's told it's from royalty!  Another wonderful entry into the series.

5.  ""Mr Piano Man"".  ****  George wants to buy a piano, for sake of status only.  Meanwhile he is told of a tennants protest meeting; and uses it to try to further himself...  There's a terrific plot twist at the end.  It's no wonder this show became so popular so quickly; the writing so far is typically top notch.  The sarcastic zingers, the plot twists, the social commentary, the educational side (particularly in ""George's Family Tree"").  I've learned more about Black History from ""The Jeffersons"" than I ever had in high school (and I graduated 15 years ago...)

7.  ""Lionel Cries Uncle"" *****  Lionel is innocent in a school brawl and is kicked out.  Meanwhile, Louise's brother Ward visits - and is known as ""Uncle Tom"" by Lionel and George.  Another top-notch entry in a top-notch series; complete with a couple surprise twists.

9.""Meet the Press"" ****  George wants to manipulate the press to get some free publicity, but things go awry...

12.""Like Father, Like Son.""  Lionel's bad behavior makes Louise think he's a ""chip off the old block"",  Meanwhile, there's an election where the 'race card' is being played.  (the breaking of stereotypes is a definite high point here.)

13.""Jenny's Low"" *****  Jenny Willis' brother makes a visit and she's upset because she can't pass as a white person, whereas he can...  (another must-see!)

There weren't any real turkeys amongst the bunch; though the aforementioned episodes I found to be the best in all categories (comedy, character, and content).

Overall, Season 1 is a gem of a show that goes all out.  It's no wonder it remained on the air for 9 more seasons.  Season 1 is definitely worth the purchase, even despite the technical faults of DVD remastering...  with luck these faults will be corrected, and commentaries and other bonus materials added for any future format or future release.  This series definitely deserves no less.",1139875200,4,3701,4.869565217391305

1728584,5,B000068V9X,"Nominated for 13 Emmys and 8 Golden Globes, The Jeffersons was a groundbreaking situation comedy that was not only utterly hilarious, but also explored the controversial social issues of its day. Premiering in mid-season 1975, the show was a spin-off of the #1 hit series All In The Family, where main characters George and Louise were the next-door neighbors of Archie and Edith Bunker. During its nine-season run, The Jeffersons spent all but its last season as a Top 25 Nielsen rated show. One of the first sitcoms to center exclusively around the lives of African-Americans, The Jeffersons most likely featured television's first interracial married couple in Tom and Helen Willis. It was this fearless attempt to push the boundaries of the status quo that made the show one of the funniest of its time as well as a valuable resource for American race relations...

The Jeffersons follows the lives of George (Sherman Hemsley) and Louise Jefferson (Isabel Sanford), a middle-aged African-American couple who own a string of successful dry cleaning stores. The windfall generated by their business paves the way for George and Louise to ""move on up"" into an exclusive Park Avenue apartment. The series is made by Hemsley's portrayal of the stubborn and greedy, yet quite lovable, character of George whose sarcasm and antics are only equaled by the Jeffersons' quick witted live-in maid Florence (Marla Gibbs). A supporting cast composed of omni-present neighbors Tom (Franklin Cover) and Helen Willis (Roxie Roker), the ever-polite Bentley (Paul Benedict), and a tip-grubbing doorman named Ralph (Ned Wertimer) provide for endless sources of irritation and annoyance for George. Throw in George's mother (Zara Cully) and her constant insults of Louise, and The Jeffersons becomes one of the best-written humorous shows of its time...

The Jeffersons (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""A Friend in Need"" in which the audience meets George and Louise Jefferson as they settle into their brand new Park Avenue apartment. George demands that Louise hire a maid to take care of place, but she refuses because she doesn't want to be bored. Meanwhile, a new friend of Louise has a hard time believing that George could reach such a level of success without compromising his ethics... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Lionel the Playboy"" in which the Jeffersons' son Lionel starts enjoying the fruits of George's labor and debates dropping out of college, and ""Rich Man's Disease"" in which George is diagnosed with an ulcer, prompting Louise to try to keep him from getting upset - a near impossible task...

Below is a list of episodes included on The Jeffersons (Season 1) DVD:

Episode 3 (Louise Feels Useless)

1728585,5,B000068V9X,"There are two types of people who remember 'The Jeffersons.' The first group fondly remember it as one of the 1970s' funniest sitcoms, pairing Sherman Helmsley and Isabelle Sanford as the hilarious and believable George and Louise Jefferson. The second group write the series off as a dumbed-down slapstick retread of 'All in the Family.' I belong to the first group, and watching the 13 episodes included here, I couldn't help but laugh until my sides hurt. Unlike most 1970s sitcom stars, when Helmsley and Sanford played it broadly they did so in a way that was equal parts Lucy and Desi as well as Laurel and Hardy. Their chemistry was fantastic, and the laughs are honestly won.

At the heart of all the episodes, of course, is George Jefferson. Like many self-made men, George has a serious inferiority complex, which reveals itself in his frequent racist and sexist comments. At heart, George is threatened by the increasingly liberal world of the 1970s and he directs much of his anger at his interracial neighbors the Willises (except when he thinks he can manipulate them). Physically, he is short, scrawny, and balding and is aware that despite his business successes, he is still largely a small fish in the very large pond that is the Big Apple. All of this remains a subtext, but one of the reasons why I enjoy 'The Jeffersons' so much is that George isn't too different from several self-made successes I know in my personal life. It's this attention to motivation that saves the series from becoming the one-note parody its detractors claim it to be. These early episodes are among the best the series ever produced.

'The Jeffersons' box set has a flaw common to other boxed sets, however. There is a complete lack of extras! Isabelle Sanford, Paul Benedict, and Roxie Roker are three series regulars who have now passed on, and Sherman Helmlsey and Marla Gibbs are rapidly aging. Recording and including their insights on the series would be a valuable service not only to their fans but to posterity as well.

If you're unaware it was a Spinoff of another hit Sitcom of the 70's ""All in the Family"". The Jefferson family were the nearby neighbors of Archie Bunker, they since ""Move Up"" to a Luxury apartment in New York City.
It's a trip watching each episode of the first season in it's full glory, with no commercials, just brief pauses where you'd normally have seen 'em. If you're only familiar with the later part of the series, you owe it to yourself to check out the first season, if for nothing else just a primer.
George Jefferson is a smart talking know-it-all. And a succesful Entrrepraer as well, owning a chain of Laundromats. some critics have pointed that his character is a bit stubborn, but to get as far as he did you would have to be.
The only slight quibble I have is that the Jeffersons maid Florence, played by the underrated Marla Gibbs, has less of a presence in these episodes, Her nice voice and sassy, witty persona rolled up smoothly alongside George Jefferson's temper.
George Jefferson's wife Louise (of course, whom he affectionately calls ""Weezy"") is played by Isabel Sanford, who won an Emmy for that role, and deservedly so.
The slight tension between George and Weezy is executed to perfection comedically. Their bickering never fails to entertain.
George Jefferson's mother is also brilliant, played by Zara Cully, whom upon researching I just learned was born in my home state of Massachusetts. she had quite a role in this early era before she passed away from cancer in 1978. Her and Weezy are always at each other's throats, partly because she couldn't be more proud of her son George.
Living in the adjacent apartment complex is Mr. Bentley, played by Paul Benedict, employed by the United Nations, his character has a literal sense of humor and brings an added punch to the cast.
In addition there's the Willises, the jeffersons upstairs neighbors Tom and Helen, played by Franklin Cover and Roxie Roker (Lenny Kravitz mom) respectively. It's my understanding that this pair was among the first Black/White couples on TV. They are constantly at verbal War with George Jefferson, who doesn't think so kindly of their marriage, but all the feuding is extremely humorous.
The only real complaint I have is the Tom Willis' character can be a bit lame and corny, personally I find it hard to believe that Helen fell for him. Their daughter, Jenny, is the boyfriend of Lionel Jefferson, George and Weezy's son.
Lionel, portrayed by Mike Evans, is a young playboy in College. There's some inner turmoil of Weezy wanting Lionel to avoid taking after his father's take-no-prisoners antics.
""The Jeffersons first season"" comes packaged as a 2 Disk Set, with episodes 1-8 being on the First Disk, and episodes 9-13 are on the Second Disk. There aren't many DVD ""Extra goodies' To speak of besides subtitles in English and Espanol. Although it would be nitpicking to criticize that fact, as getting this Legendary Series and being able to watch it whenever you please is a Gift enough in itself.
Theres been an impressive 3 decades of African-American sitcoms, and the 70's, with shows like ""Sanford And Son"" and ""The Jeffersons"" still stand as the best era - Bar None.
If you're unfamiliar with it, pick up the Jeffersons first season, ahora.",1057622400,5,3711,4.836477987421383
1728589,5,B000068V9X,"Before George Jefferson,I don't think anybody found prejudice humorous. Referring to caucasians as ""honkies"" and half-black and half-white people as ""zebras"" heavily tickles my funny bone. There was also little mention of the word that rhymes with ""bigger"" on this collection. Tom Willis and Harry Bentley are the ""honkies"" on the show. The children of Tom and his black wife Helen are the ""zebras"". Archie Bunker's prejudice is not as humorous as George's. George expresses his with mild anger. Archie often expresses his calmly. The Jeffersons have come a long way since they lived on Hauser Street in Queens. Since moving to Manhattan,Archie's daughter Gloria and her husband Mike went into the Jeffersons' home residentially. This is the first of eleven successful seasons. Unfortunately,NBC's ""The Cosby Show"" brought the Jeffersons' ratings down.",1054857600,,852,5.462121212121212
