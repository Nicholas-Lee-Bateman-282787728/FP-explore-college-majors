6357943,5,B00JHH20VY,Very clever movie!,1413072000,,18,5.333333333333333
6357944,4,B00JHH20VY,"Beautiful, although not perfect. To give some perspective on my viewpoint, although this is marketed as a family (read ""children's"") movie the concepts and themes are probably too adult for most children. This is more, I think, for those around 10 to 12 years old on up. I don't have children myself however and watched this with another adult.

For those unaware, this was based off of a concept album by the French band Dionysus whom I'd not heard of before watching the film. The original album was also turned into a book (which I haven't read) before finally being made into this movie, also originally in French from what I can tell. I believe the book was translated into English but haven't found an English version of the album. Not speaking French myself I don't know but feel it must have been a difficult project for the translator as the story is filled with metaphor and concepts that probably are better understood in the original language.

For my review itself I thought about the film in four parts; visuals, dialogue, music, and cultural references.

To begin with I found most of the animation stunning. I don't know what methods were used but it had a very hand drawn cell animation feel about it (this is a good thing). Watch the background and you'll see a lot of interesting little details. There was one scene I didn't care for set on a train that didn't add anything much to the story and wasn't that interesting to me but everything else looked great. Very stylized but still charming and keeping a feel for the time it was set in. As another reviewer mentions a little bit steampunk.

The acting was well done also. The tonality and pacing of the voices made me want to listen to the dialogue and phrasing more than once. The dialogue deserves repeated listening as the pacing is unique and intertwined with the music as well as being very metaphor heavy which can make it easy to miss what is being said. By this I mean the meaning of what is being said not the actual words which are clear.

Besides the animation the music was my favorite thing about the film. I didn't care for all of the songs and felt a couple pieces didn't fit well such as ghost train. For that piece it isn't that the song itself is bad it just has such a different feel from the others it's a little jarring (possibly intended to be by the artist). The Spanish language songs are performed wonderfully and the song where Jack first meets Miss Acacia in Edinburgh is now one of my favorite songs. I must have listened to it about twenty times in the last few days.

Finally the cultural references. Minor spoilers ahead here. The train scene I didn't care for introduces Jack the Ripper for some odd reason. I don't know if the writer just felt the need for more Victorian era tidbits or he is supposed to represent something I just haven't figured out but this was a very weak point in the story. He wasn't needed as a villain as that already existed in both Jack's heart itself as well as the bully at school. It wasn't needed to force the introduction of any new characters or changes to the story either. Jack could have damaged his heart simply by falling or running from a crowd of people frightened by his heart. It simply felt like someone was a fan of the Jack the Ripper story and said ""hey they are both named Jack, we should add him to the story"".

Although i didn't like the Jack the Ripper scene I loved the addition of Georges Milieu. While he wasn't completely necessary for telling the story he acted as a good counterbalance to Jack's overprotective mother, encouraging Jack to be bold, take risks, and that some things are worth fighting for even if it doesn't work out how you want. I hadn't been familiar with him before watching the film Hugo and it was wonderful seeing another homage to his work.

The film made me really wish I spoke French to gain a possibly better understanding of French way of thinking and interpreting the story and would like to see some reviews by people that are French or have a better understanding of French thought and culture.

Major spoiler now.

Although I was okay with the end it was depressing and I guess I share that common American trait of liking a positive happy ending which this doesn't have (although it does a bit). Although Jack does get the girl in the end he dies doing it and mostly at his own hands. It was almost like he took a gamble that his love would fix his heart but it didn't. If this had been a typical ""Hollywood"" film it would have been enough that his mother had died and Jack would have been saved by his love, by Miss Acacia, or at least by Mileau at the end, something that would have pleased me.

I enjoyed this enough to buy the blue ray after already having watched it twice.",1412812800,7,4771,4.453608247422681
6357945,3,B00JHH20VY,"I always find these foreign animated films a bit odd but I leave it to the true critics to weigh in: my kids! Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock heart elicited the following responses from my kids.

Reed, 6 year old boy: ""I don't want to watch that. It looks super creepy.""

Paige, 5 year old girl: ""I want to watch that! It looks kind of spooky!""

And there you have it! If a kid likes creepy, strange things, they will like this movie. If not, probably not so much. Reed DID end up coming in and out and there were a few parts that captured his attention. But then as soon as the music changed or it got dark, he was out of there!

As the name implies, this boy Jack literally has a cuckoo clock heart. As if that weren't strange enough, he has to follow these three instructions:

Never touch the hands of the clock.
Control your anger.
Never fall in love.
I get the first two, even agree with them. They make sense right? And I like the control your anger one. Nice little life lesson for the kiddos! But never fall in love? What kind of nonsense is that? And so of course you know where this is going, he meets a girl he's interested in and..... well you'll have to watch to find out!

My kids like the accents of the characters and I think that's part of what makes this truly unique. It's very like Tim Burton in design and execution so if you like that sort of thing, you will probably enjoy it. I'm not the biggest fan ever and so this is definitely not my cup of tea. But it had it's endearing qualities and my little girl really liked it. She loves music and so that really piqued her interest.

Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart is truly and original. Sometimes that's good and sometimes it's bad but all in all, worth watching.",1412726400,3,1729,4.205438066465256
6357946,1,B00JHH20VY,"Beautiful animation, great soundtrack, exceptional design, but the ending .....oh the ending. Too many red herrings one what could of saved Jack.
Example:
* His actual heart could of been kept on ice.
* The woman who lovingly raised him as her own (instead of ditching him like his real mother) could of built a better clock heart. Afterall,in a haste, she built a great one initially to save his life.
* The inventor he befriended could of and even offered to build a better heart.
* The girl he literally gave the key to his heart to handed the key to him. All he had to do was wind up his heart and he would be good to go. Instead, he just throws the key away in front of her.
I won't spoil anything with a long-winded self-serving review, but the trailer to the movie really gives you an idea to the overall ""vibe"" of the movie. Very different, but extremely compelling to watch. There are many characters in the movie that you think you will not like, but actually do a great deal.
This will be a great movie to show kids who are curious about love, abandonment, bullying, unregulated labor, death and the public education system versus homeschooling. As a social worker assisting small undocumented children who cross our borders alone through some form of encouragement of their parents, I intend to show this movie to them as to what they can expect in their new life.",1412640000,5,1376,4.508
6357947,5,B00JHH20VY,"Jack and The Cuckoo-Clock Heart kept me captivated from beginning to end. The visual style of the movie is truly fantastic and shows the emotions of the characters though visual whimsy. The look of the film is a bit of steam punk with lots of eye candy of interesting designed gadgets and background surroundings. The story we found to be finely crafted and felt that it flows smoothly over the course of the film.  I didn't realize it was going to be more on the musical side but felt it fit exceptionally feel.  A lot of thoughts, feelings, and emotions definitely will be invoked upon viewing this such film of the heart.

I would urge parents to take into consideration the pg rating. In fact, I wouldn't recommend it for children under the age of 13. There's nothing particularly awful as in gore or swearing. It's not graphic. I just believe the maturity of those who may be viewing this film be taken into consideration. It's about love and we all know that it can get messy with our heart sending feelings to our brain we sometimes just can't make sense of.

The bonus features on this DVD I enjoyed. Each of the characters in the movie are broken down and explained and there's a segment on how the movie was adapted from book. It's always  nice to see the behind the scenes to truly appreciate all the hard work that went into making such a engaging film. All features are in French with English subtitles.  The run time of the movie is 89 minutes and it didn't feel too long or too short.  I would definitely recommend seeing it and if you've seen a Monster in Paris you'll pleased to know the same producers are part of this one.",1412467200,20,1641,4.45
6357948,4,B00JHH20VY,"This was a very creative movie that weaves together a unique story with beautiful illustration. I have to be honest and say that I think the story was made more for adults than kids, as the messages are deep and dark at points and the subject matter was sometimes a bit too mature for young eyes (in my perspective).

The music and animation were wonderful and there are so many hidden gems in both that you will find.

The message of living without regret and loving to the fullest no matter what the cost was a message you do not always see in movies, met alone animated ones, so this was a fresh perspective and something new!

The only other thing that I will add is that I am not for certain on how I like the character of Joe. In watching this, I don't know that his character was needed and that the addition of him really just muddled the waters. I felt that the movie could have explained and shared some of the same points without the darkness of Joe himself.

All-in-all this was a unique movie that was unlike many animated films that I have seen.

6357951,2,B00JHH20VY,"It is rare to find English language animated films not done by Disney or Dreamworks, or have their label on it for American distribution, so imagine finding a film which looks like a low budget Tim Burton film. One which, like most Disney movies, is a musical of sorts and has its own prominent director with Luc Besson (director of Lucy & The Family). But the question is: with this film barely having much buzz or news around it, does that mean it is bad or that simply it just doesnt have a good marketing push?

Characters & Story

Poor little Jack (Mathias Malzieu) was abandoned by his mother on the day he was born and left with the rumored town witch Madeline (Marie Vincent/ Emily Loizeau). A woman incapable of having children of her own, but was given little Jack to be her son. Issue is, Jack was born on the coldest day ever known and the cold froze his little heart. So, being that Madeline is quite skilled in replacing body parts with things around the house, she decides to replace Jacks heart with a cuckoo clock.
Something which leads to quite a bit of difficulty for Jack. If just because of the rules involved with having a cuckoo clock heart: 1. He can never touch the clocks hands; 2. He must always watch his temper; and most of all, 3. He cannot fall in love. All of these issues Madeline kept Jack safe from for as long as she could, but on his 11th birthday she takes him into town, perhaps for the first time ever in his life, and naturally he falls in love at first sight.

Leading to the heart of our story which deals with Jack trying to live a normal life. One in which he deals with the issues that come with loving a woman like Miss Acacia (Olivia Ruiz). Issues which are distance, since she moves away; dealing with his own jealousy and Joes (Grand Corps Malade), who looks like a bootleg Robert Pattinson; and a slew of other emotions which put a heavy load on Jacks cuckoo clock heart. Leaving you to wonder, in the pursuit of love will Jack find bliss, misery, or perhaps the end of his mortality?

Praise

If you look at the basic premise of the story, a boy with a weak heart falling in love, you have a wonderful tale. One which has lots of cute moments between Jack and Miss Acacia, with a handful of songs, in the beginning, which really highlight their tale of love at first sight well. Then, on top of that, you have a slew of interesting characters like Madeline, and those who she has fixed with wooden legs, or a xylophone spine, which presents a whole other story you wish was explored. Yet, even without the information you seek, just the oddness of every character, and the animation which isn't the most complex, and yet still is quite beautiful, the film is a treat for the eyes.

Criticism

But what makes this movie a bit difficult to like, without pause, is the music and the dialog. Starting with the music, the band Dionysos recorded all the music for the movie and, to me, it has a David Bowie type vibe, and not in a good way. Think some of his music in Labyrinth to get the general feel of the music in the film. Which isn't to say all the songs are bad, some in the beginning I liked, and Miss Acacias Spanish numbers were good, but for the most parts the songs I wanted to mute for lyric wise they weren't interesting, and the voices in front of the music didn't help much either.

Moving to the topic of dialog, what I want to convey is while the story is good, i.e. what happens throughout the movie, the dialog really isnt. For, in my opinion, like the music, the more you watch the movie the more flaws and things to dislike youll find. Like when the story is set in Edinburgh things are for the most part are good, but with the travel to France, and the introduction of Melies (Jean Rochefort), the only saving grace is Miss Acacia. For with Melies, him talking about love, among other topics, and then, anything not featuring solely Miss Acacia and Jack, just seems like people are talking for the sake of taking up time and not making any sense, or really adding to the story much.

Leading to my last issue: Joe. To me, Joes presence in the film is overkill and so unnecessary. In my opinion, it would have perhaps been better to cut Joe and just make Jack ostracized without Joe being the central bully. Much less have him come around at the most opportune time to reveal the rules of Jacks heart to Acacia. After all, between Madelines patients, Melies, or Jack himself, there were many better ways to reveal the rules without the happenstance of Joe showing up on the most important day of Jack and Miss Acacias burgeoning relationship.

Overall: TV Viewing

I am on the border of saying to skip this due to the music, Joes character, and the dialog; however, I really do like the romantic story of Miss Acacia and Jack, as well as Jacks relationship with Madeline, to the point I, with some hesitation, am going to label this TV Viewing. For while Jacks relationships aren't written to be so grand they will leave a precedent in your mind, his relationship with Miss Acacia is cute enough to deal with all the nonsense surrounding it.",1410048000,4,5109,4.407211028632026

6357984,5,B00JHH20VY,"First off: Not for children. Most of the metaphors they won't understand and the ones they get, they probably are too young to truly comprehend.

Review: Truly one of my favorite movies. It's a slightly bizarre love story full of metaphors and imagery that requires a bit of thinking. I pick up something new each time I watch it. The second time I watched it, I understood what the ending was really saying and it made me cry. I prefer my happy endings but that's on me.

Pros: Fantastic music. Wonderful imagery, and a beautiful art style all around. Great story most people can relate to if they've been in world-shattering love. Flip the paper in the sleeve for alternate cover art (I have a strange love of cases that have this).

Cons: When you realize what happened to Jack, you'll be bummed. Great ending, but still. Also the digital code it comes with expired 2 years ago. So this is a DVD/BluRay package, although it must be easy enough to rip it from the DVD.",1506556800,,970,4.5

No. In one scene a ten-year-old Jack sings to a young girl around his age that he wants to tear her clothes off with his teeth and kiss her naked body. Can you imagine if Tim Burton tried that? No more block busters for him. The beautiful animation and soundtrack are nowhere near enough to make up for the fact that this movie needed some very heavy editing, or better yet a complete rewrite of the script. The story really is all over the place and there are briefly featured characters, like Jack the Ripper, who have no discernable reason to have been thrown in at all.

The whole story is fastened together seamlessly with beautiful music and dialogue that has more than just the initial meaning. The metaphors and foreshadowing in this piece make it so interesting to watch and add to the mystical, whimsical feel of the movie. There are some scenes that people find strange, like the Jack the Ripper scene, or why Miss Acacia grows thorns from time to time, but if you think of everything as a metaphor, even the seemingly strange whimsy starts to make sense and add even more to the plot and characters. (spoilers ahead) Also, some complain about the ending, how Jack basically killed himself by throwing away the key. Why didn't he just use it and live? His mom's death really hit him hard. He didn't want to live anymore. The fact that Miss Acacia came back for him was enough to bring him joy in his last hours, but he had already made up his mind to die. In order to kiss her, he threw away the key, so she wouldn't feel responsible for his death and become a ""murderess,"" which is what made her run away earlier. It was a beautiful, bitter-sweet ending that I wish more people loved. The sad fact though, was that his love for his mother was what really killed him, and not the love for Miss Acacia, as his mother had worried.

6358079,5,B00JHH20VY,"Nine Things About the Film ""Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart""

1. This is a French animated steampunk alt-rock musical. If you're like me, that's all you need to know. You can stop reading this article and go watch it now.

It's based on a concept album and a book made by the surreal French rock band Dionysos. The film's music was entirely composed by Dionysos, and it was co-directed by the band's lead singer.

2. This looks like a charming Tim Burton-esque movie for the whole family. But as characters in the movie learn, appearances can lie. This movie is dark. It's one for the grown-ups. There is nothing particularly wrong with letting kids watch it, they just won't understand it. It's full of symbolic violence, heartbreak, death, and sexual innuendo. The fact that it all takes place in a childlike atmosphere is a brain-squeezing paradox.

3. It begins with a dying pregnant woman trying to make it to a witch's house on the coldest day ever. The witch delivers a boy, but he has a heart made of ice. The witch replaces his heart with a clock.

The witch warns the boy, Jack, that he must be careful not to mess with his clock, never lose his temper, and never fall in love. If he experiences any intense emotions, his heartclock will break and he will die.

Of course, Jack meets a pretty girl named Miss Acacia. Whenever she feels threatened or angry, she sprouts thorns. Jack is so smitten with her that he almost dies. And then she moves far away without telling him. After some bad things happen at home, Jack travels to Spain, in an attempt to find her.

4. Jack meets a number of odd people on his adventures to win Miss Acacia's heart, from an emo schoolyard bully, to Georges Mlis, the real man who helped develop early movie special effects techniques. In a super-weird episode on a train (and one that can lead your thoughts to some very dark places), Jack runs into a different Jack - also known as The Ripper. This Jack has his own ideas about how to handle a woman's heart.

5. There are some roguish things that occur in the movie, and interesting character quotes that you probably won't catch unless you're watching it with subtitles on. The carnival town in which Miss Acacia lives is kind of a mix of a Fellini movie and Tod Browning's Freaks. Jack gets a job as a ""frightener"", where his duty is to cause people to feel emotions that would kill himself.

6. The movie takes some common idioms about love and life and makes them literal. For example, Jack has an actual key to his heart, and he wants to really give it to the woman he loves.

7. Some of the elements of the film kind of grate together; they don't quite mesh as well as Dionysos may have hoped. But that itself adds to the film's inexplicable charm.

8. I greatly respect the movie's ending. There were many ways the film could have resolved itself, but it stayed true to its vision without becoming manipulative or mawkish.

6358121,4,B00JHH20VY,"This French-animated film was inspired by an album by the rock group Dionysos, and produced by Adele director Luc Benson, which plays out like a Tim Burton musical with slightly modern rock styles added.

 Set in 1870s Scotland, Jack was a boy born on the coldest day ever, and his heart was frozen solid. Fortunately, the midwife Madeleine was also an acclaimed witch with a talent in science who replaced Jacks infant heart with a cobbled together cuckoo-clock, and she eventually becomes his adopted mother. Years later, and Jacks first day out in the city has him falling in love with a nearsighted calliope player named Acacia, although this causes his artificial heart to malfunction as one of the things he cant do is fall in love as the strain would be lethal. Jack then quests for Acacia after shes skipped town, and his search leads him to historical figures like Jack the Ripper, and George Melies who just created the movie projector. Jack finds Acacia now working as a flamenco dancer in a carnival where they confess their feelings for each other, which leads to a rather ambiguous ending.

 It works out as decent steampunk feature, especially with the fictional accounting of Melies as a supporting character, although the English translation of some of the musical lyrics aren't totally understandable, and the film operates under more fairy tale logic than maybe it needs to.",1451952000,,1393,4.914893617021277
6358122,4,B00JHH20VY,Very interesting cinematography and story line and the sound track is fabulous!,1449014400,,79,5.666666666666667
6358123,2,B00JHH20VY,"It was through this studio's earlier film, ""A Monster in Paris"", as well as some word of mouth, that I came across this odd looking little movie. Although my tastes lean more towards science fiction, I'm always up for a good fairy tale, and after LOVING ""A Monster in Paris"", I figured another outing with the same French studio would be just as good.

Sadly, this wasn't to be the case, for this is, no doubt, one of the strangest and trippiest movies I've watched in a long time (and not in the good way).

In Edinburgh, Scotland 1874, a boy named Jack is born on the coldest day ever. Due to the extreme cold, he's born with a frozen heart which will not beat. The attendant midwife Madeleine saves his life by replacing his heart with a cuckoo clock. She then advises him of three rules to prevent his untimely death; he must never play with the hands of the clock, he must never lose his temper, and finally, he must never fall in love. But upon Jack's first journey into town, he becomes infatuated with a girl named Miss Acacia, as well as runs afowl of a bully named Joe, who's also in love with her. When a confrontation with Joe forces Jack to leave town, he then goes on a quest to be reunited with Miss Acacia. And along the way, he learns both the good and the dangers of falling in love. Will he find a way to love Acacia without being hurt? Or will he find romance at the cost of his life?

If you follow my other reviews here on Amazon, then you might find me echoing a similar thing I said in my review of the book, ""The Night Circus""--that this movie, to me, seems like the creators got so wrapped up in the world building and artwork that the characters and story suffered as a consequence. This film is certainly pretty to look at, especially if you're a fan of the steampunk genre...and that's about it. But the characters themselves straddle the line of the Uncanny Valley. Unlike ""A Monster in Paris"", which had highly stylized characters similar to a Pixar movie, this film took a slightly more realistic route...and in doing so, all the humans look and move like dolls with dead eyes, and they barely make any sort of expressions no matter what emotion they're supposed to be feeling; making the whole movie creepy to watch at times.

And sadly, the characters don't make things much better. They're all enormously flat and boring. Jack seems to have no other motivations or hopes or dreams beyond chasing this one girl he likes. And speaking of Acacia, she's just as bland, with her and Jack falling in love literally at first sight without knowing a single thing about each other. Granted, they interact a bit later on once they find each other again, but it's not enough for me to buy their relationship. And Joe is the biggest mystery; having no personality beyond just being a jerk and a bully. It's like he was added in just for the sake of having a villain, which I don't think this movie really needed. Honestly, the best character was the traveling magician that Jack runs into along his journey, making me wish HE was the main character instead. (And on a side note, I think the English voice cast wasn't the greatest. They do a decent job in terms of acting, but the voices for Jack and Acacia, especially when they're supposed to be little kids, are WAY too deep. Ten year old Jack sounds like he's 20, and young Acacia sounds like a grown woman.)

As for the plot, it's a fairly decent one on paper, and clever too--about how a boy learns the meaning of true love, and the girl literally holding the key to his heart. But the presentation of said idea just makes it utterly confusing. They play up Jack's cuckoo clock heart like he's some weird anomaly...but then we see people with homemade artificial limbs, a man with a xylophone for a spine, and circus folk with two heads, or big heads, or literal fairies flying around. And Acacia, meanwhile, sprouts thorns around her neck when she's distressed (and no, we never get an explanation), and randomly floats in the air when she's happy. So clearly, this is a magical, fantasy/fairy tale world....which makes it much harder to see Jack as such an outcast. It would've made more sense if this were like ""Edward Scissorhands"", where the rest of the world is 'normal', and Jack is the only unique one of his kind. But when your entire world is filled with strange people, it makes his struggle that much harder to accept.

On a final note, this is probably the weirdest music choices I've ever heard in a movie. The steampunk style this movie is set in would make you think that a classical score would be the order of the day...but instead, scenes are filled with rock and roll cues, as well as some hip-hop beats, and the songs that the characters sing are not only forgettable, but constantly come out of left field with barely any segway into them. Half the time, they don't even rhyme. Joe doesn't even get a song. Instead, he has two moments where he randomly starts spouting poetry that...well, he isn't quite talking, but he's not fully singing either. Pick one or the other, people...

Maybe this movie is just too 'avant-garde' for me, but as it stands, between the weird visuals, the bland characters, the so-so animation on the humans, the random songs, and the odd music choices, this whole film is nothing but an artsy mess. For those of you who like Tim Burton's output, or surrealness and steampunk, then maybe you'll like this. But for me, I'm sticking with ""A Monster in Paris"". At least that was a fairy tale I could clearly follow and understand.",1448496000,,5553,4.508440913604766

Fantastic animation, and a charming concept, but no real character development whatsoever.  Story is all over the place, and a little hectic.  The music is intriguing, but most of the lyrics are so terrible that it's distracting.  Again, a much younger viewer would likely be able to overlook the comical terribleness of the laughable dialog and prose.
I wouldn't really recommend this for younger children, as ten year old Jack sings about ripping Acacia's clothes off with his teeth, and let's face it... that's super creepy.

It is a surreal steampunk masterpiece that packs a visual wallop.  It's also a crafty tale of woe, about a poor boy abandoned by his heartless mother who doubts her own ability to be a mother, even as he is born with a nonfunctioning heart of ice.  If not for the ingenuity of Madeleine the midwife, Jack's time on Earth would have been a short one indeed.  But she fits him with a cuckoo-clock and a few basic rules he almost manages to follow.  Sadly, he would fall in love.  The ending is a foregone conclusion but very artfully done.  The whimsy displayed throughout is fantastical.  I especially love the inclusion of Jack's friend Georges Melies (one of the first cinematic creators known for his special effects).  It was a fitting tribute.

The themes utilized throughout are decidedly adult in nature, as is most of the humor.  The music is fun.  (Wish they thought to release the original soundtrack.)  It's a shame this was never nominated for an Oscar, considering some of the muck that is.

The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!

I feel like this film was like a Tim Burton film that needed some more editing.  There are plot issues, like, no explanation why his heart is a big deal and makes him a freak, but the girl gets frightened and is covered in thorns magically, and that's normal I guess.  Or one guy is just a rolling head, but man, that heart makes him a freak.  One guy's spine is a xylophone, but again, only the heart is weird.

But it's not just that, there were many odd loose ends.  Her parents get turned in and she has to flee, subplot that literally drops there.  His mom expressly tells him he doesn't have to go to school, he goes to see the girl, and then continues to go (with her not there) for four years and is bullied mercilessly.  Honestly there is not any reasoning for why that even happens, why he doesn't just stop going?  Why didn't the makers of this film screen the story and see the major plot issues?

Okay, but if you can look past the kooky plot points, it's beautiful.  It is artistic, creative, musical.  You can't look away!  The music is intense and powerful and I really hope they make some more of these because if they get better at this they will be making magic.  This is a fascinating delicious style that I'd love to watch more of.

As for the innuendo stuff....I don't think little kids would even register the meaning in most cases so I don't see that as a strong mark against the film.
For most adults I think this film will likely be either a hit or miss with little gray area in between. I enjoyed it because it is visually interesting but the story, while also having its own charm, seems a little scattered. Without spoiling anything, there doesn't seem to be a clear motivation for the main character's actions at the end (which can be interpreted as bittersweet) and much is left for viewer interpretation (at least that's my impression on first viewing).

I should have researched the movie more and not just looked at the photos and the positive reviews from the critics. The animation was good and knowing more about the story behind the movie was also interesting. But this is yet another reason to not judge a book - or in this case a DVD - by its cover.",1426291200,3,619,4.254237288135593

My only complaint is that somehow in this sweet little film the story fell flat.. It had all the elements for a home run, but was lacking in emotion. It's like it just didn't have enough heart portrayed- even though it was set up to be so. Much like the animated film 9. This is one movie that because of it's failing I will definitely read the book to see if it offers what was missing. All this being said, I very much enjoyed it- would watch it again, and even bought it for a friend who looks like Jack, sings like Jack, and happens to repair clocks for a living. 4 stars.",1426118400,,738,4.2785714285714285

Such a beautiful tragic ending. Perfect. I also really enjoyed the music through out the movie and I almost always hate music in movies but the music was perfect and tragic.

6358256,2,B00JHH20VY,"Jack is somewhat interesting.  It has a cool train with accordions connecting the cars. It is the 2nd film I've seen ) that features Georges Mlis as a character. The other film is Hugo, a great superior film. Jack the Ripper also makes a guest cameo trying to kill the protagonist. Although somewhat entertaining the film has serious narrative and problematic content.  If a movie is recommended and aimed for children it should be void of suggestive content. It has no place in a kids film. Also it is creepy and weird but not in the good way, in say a film like Labyrinth. Also the ending kills any chance of it being a good film.

I hope I can convey this ending adequately so you don't need to sit through this picture. Or perhaps you will want to sit through it to witness it first hand. Jack has a Cuckoo-Clock heart. He goes on a series of adventures to find this girl and finds her, they sort of fall in love and he gives her the literal key to his heart.  The key winds his heart so it keeps on ticking. She gets mad at him and his heart breaks. . He goes back home from the place where he was at to have his adoptive mother fix it for him.  Only problem is his mum is dead.  He goes out into the snow to die.

His true love realizes her mistake and goes to find him. She finds him in the snow and offers to wind his heart for him with the key he gave her. He tosses the key into the snow instead and kisses her. The scene then freezes as if somebody stopped time. He begins to climb to the sky on the snowflakes hanging lifeless in the air.

""Oh, my pretty arsonist/Let me clasp you close to me/Rip your clothes with my teeth/And tear them to confetti/To scatter as we kiss.""

My daughter loves to sing and dance to all of her favorite music from her favorite shows...I am sure I would get a call from her school if she launched into that song during music class! I did finish watching it when my daughter went to bed--it was def compelling to me as an adult as I can't really say that I have felt a need to watch any of her other cartoons on my own!

6358274,4,B00JHH20VY,"I fell absolutely in love with this film, the first time I watched it on Netflix, and I was overjoyed when I looked it up here, and saw the words ""English, French"" listed under the language.  Imagine my deep disappointment, when this DVD arrived and you could only watch the Special Features in French, not the movie itself!  It was A Monster in Paris all over again!  The English language cast does well, but I wanted so so much to be able to also watch the film in its original language!

As deeply unhappy about that as I am, this movie truly is a work of art, so it only loses one star for the language issue.  The little blurb on the box says it's the best animated romance since The Corpse Bride, but I will hazard to say that I found this movie to be even better. (And that's speaking as a Burton fan.)  The story is bittersweet and teaches a valuable lesson, and the visuals are some of the most beautiful I have seen in a film in a long time.

Many parents, here in America, may find some of the subject matter a bit dark and mature for a young child, so I would advise that you watch the film yourself, first.  However, I will say, when I was a child, myself, I always hated the patronizing tone of many movies geared toward children.  I would have eaten this movie right up, back then, as much as I do now, along with my old favorites: the Last Unicorn, The Dark Crystal, Legend, Labyrinth, and The Secret of NIMH.  So, this is very much a Your Mileage May Very sort of situation.  Either way I DO recommend seeing this film!  But you might want to look into importing it from Canada.  I understand you can get a French Language version of A Monster in Paris, from there, that will play on our DVD players.  I am hoping it will be the same with this one.

If I wanted to only see it in English I could watch it on Netflix without having paid the extra 10 bucks for this DVD.

I'm not going to spoil it, but it's a very powerful movie and allows you to believe in Love again, it's like if Romeo and Juliet met Tim Burton, this would be their child.

For example, they insinuate that 2 women have an abortion. In one scene they are pregnant and the woman (who is Jacks adoptive mother) says she needs a minute alone to help these two because ""they have seen the storks AGAIN"" and in the next scene they are no longer pregnant.

6358383,4,B00JHH20VY,"I bought this to watch with my 5 and 4 year old for movie night.  Although they've watched it a couple of times on their own after that, they are still a little wide-eyed at some of the darker elements.  This movie isn't really aimed at children.
The visuals are stunning, and the storyline, though simple, is involving.",1415059200,5,320,4.5
6358384,1,B00JHH20VY,"This movie had a lot of promise, but it is very sexual.  I didn't make it past the first 20 minutes or so before I turned it off.  Not only does Jack see a woman who appears to be 20 when he's 10 years old and sings about ripping off her clothes with his teeth.  He also comes across a young girl around the age of 7 years old who is eating cotton candy.  He references wanting to eat you/that and the girl looks up and says ""Are you talking about ME?""  That is disgusting.  The movie is inferring a young boy saying he wants to eat (oral sex) a young girl.  I am not prissy by any means with my children.  I am not a fundamentalist, but trust me when you say if you listen carefully to this movie, you will hear lots of sexual innuendos that are far and above the level of a children's movie.",1414886400,9,793,3.9746835443037973
6358385,5,B00JHH20VY,"I didn't think I could love French cinema any more than I do. I've watched some of the best of live-action French cinema, but I've never seen an animated French feature (produced by Luc Besson produced, no less). Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart kindled an interest in me to watch more French cinema.

The beautiful thing about this movie, other than the way it looks, is its style. It is based on a rock concept album by the rock band Dionysus, so it is a musical - a feature animated musical. Simply put, Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart is the best animated feature since Toy Story 3 (not counting The Wind Rises for the sake of our mostly American readers) and it is the best musical since Sweeney Todd and Hairspray.

The movie has a very unique animated look. It is not quite as clay animated as Mary and Max but not as ""normal looking,"" per se, as Finding Nemo. It comes off as a cross between the two. I'll admit, I am no expert in the creation of animated films but I do know what works in a film. Another aspect of the film's look, its art direction, is quite beautiful. It is dark, mysterious and effective in its tone. Speaking of which - the tone is quite dark with an underlying feeling of loss and rejection.

Even the score, in its happiest moments, have a heavy feeling under the surface. Although love does find its way into the story and the objectives of the characters, loss and judgment resurface. The themes are quite adult and not appropriate for young children.

As to the finest aspect of the movie - the score and songs, I would love this to be turned into a Broadway musical. The style of the musical and the editing combined is reminiscent of Moulin Rouge, filled with vivacity and rapid pacing. The songs each carry their own beat and enhance the personalities of each character and its intentions. There is a mixture of ballads, rap, rock and even Latin.  I would buy the soundtrack to this movie.

The story itself is about a boy born with a heart so weak that falling in love would be too much for him. The movie follows his early life where he inevitably falls in love (screenwriting 101) and the strength of his heart is put to the test.

I have learned over the years that just because a film is animated, it's not necessarily designed for children. Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart isn't exactly The Grave of the Fireflies but it is not for young children either. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18. And my rating is 5 out of 5 stars. It is a wonderful film. It is one of the top five animated features of this decade.

6358387,3,B00JHH20VY,"Visually interesting. Unfortunately that is the only good thing that can be said of this movie. The biggest problem is the sound track.  The voice styling of the actors just doesn't fit the characters. The mismatch is so bad that one often feels as though it was done for another movie entirely.  Another major flaw is the facial animation.  It is flat and inexpressivedreadful really.  If you are interested in animation for its own sake it may have some value both for its visual inventiveness and as a cautionary tail as to what should be avoided.

In any case I recommend waiting for it to hit the bargain bin. Even $10 would be too much for this on bluray.

Knocked this up to 3 stars after  watching it 3 more times. I still hold to the original opinions. Just needed to dial back the level of criticism.",1413676800,2,810,4.469387755102041
6358388,1,B00JHH20VY,NOT a children's movie. Cutting out a child's heart? Ick. Children saying aggressively sexually-loaded statements to each other? Gross and wrong. At one point in the movie Jack said to the girl that he wanted to shred the girl's clothes with his teeth. That is the sort of thing that rapists say. If a boy said that to my daughter I would be calling the police. Children just don't say those sorts of things to each other! The fact that more people aren't shocked and dismayed at this movie disturbs me.,1413331200,10,503,4.538461538461538

It is a beautifully strange and quirky thing to watch and un all honesty when my mom tried to watch it with me she got bored halfway through. So like anything odd or not mainstream, it is an acquired taste. I loved what few special features it had but do wish there were more. Then again. I am pretty into all the bonus material that comes with DVDs and BLUE Rays's today. Since for some reason I can't find the English sound track, I like putting it on as background sound when piddling around the house.",1531008000,,595,4.228070175438597
