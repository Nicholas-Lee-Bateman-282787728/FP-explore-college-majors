8441609,4,B004UJITX2,"Lee Jin Soo is a popular thriller-novel author and has many female fans. His publisher, Seo Eun Young, is not one of them. She knows under his fake image, he's an obsessive-compulsive, bitter, and unreliable man that is haunted by his dark past. She has a terrible time getting Jin Soo to fulfill the requirements of his contract, including public appearances.

Another day of running away from an interview, he steps into a small rundown coffee shop. There he meets gullible, kind, and naive, Kang Seung Yeon, a barista with no talent in making coffee.

Later on, Jin Soo hires Seung Yeon to be his personal secretary as a favor to a friend. He at first makes her read and take notes on a large fossil book day after day. Seung Yeon doesn't realize he is just giving her meaningless work. After awhile, Jin Soo finds her to be an interesting and funny character and has her do all sorts of weird things to help him write his new thriller novel. Seung Yeon is determined to keep helping him even though she does strange tasks without any explanation to why she is doing them. They end up developing an awkward and interesting friendship.

Eventually, Seung Yeon starts to develop feelings for Jin Soo. But many people from Jin Soo's past start showing up and love triangles begin to form and working becomes difficult. Dark secrets and pasts are revealed, love blooms, and jealousy grows as the story unfolds.

This is an entertaining romantic comedy. It has many likable characters and a good story. There is comedy and sweet and sad emotional moments. It does have it's duller scenes here and there, but I would recommend giving it a try. (18 episodes) (Kang Seung Yeon is played by Ham Eun Jung from k-pop group, ""T-ARA."")",1390089600,,1725,4.6644736842105265
