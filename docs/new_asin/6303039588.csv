552370,3,6303039588,"It's always been Hollywood gospel that films about the American Revolution don't earn any money - hence there are few of them and ""John Paul Jones"" is one of these few. The film stars Robert Stack with a star studded cast including Bette Davis, Charles Coburn, Macdonald Carey, Bruce Cabot, Peter Cushing, Thomas Gomez, and Jean-Pierre Aumont.

One of the great things about a film like this is you get to see historical characters like Ben Franklin, Patrick Henry, George Washington, Catherine the Great, King Louis XVI, and Marie Antoinette.

Handsome Robert Stack (1919-2003) is best known from his Emmy winning performance in the TV series ""The Untouchables"" (1959-63), but he made dozens of films including ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940) and ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1942) which were two of the best pre war anti-Nazi films. Shortly after Stack enlisted in the Navy. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Written on the Wind"" (1957)

Charles Coburn (1877-1961) plays Ben Franklin. He appeared in more than 50 films, from 1933 through 1962. He was nominated for an Oscar 3 times and won once (""The More the Merrier"" in 1943). I remember him best as ""Piggy"" in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blonds"" (1953).This was Coburn's last film and he does his usual great job.

Thomas Gomez (1905-1971) was nominated for an Oscar for ""Ride the Pink Horse"" (1947). He put in good performances in nearly 100 films. I think his best role was in the film noir ""Force of Evil"" (1948) and as Coach Abe Saperstein in ""The Harlem Globetrotters"" (1951).

Bette Davis (1908-89) plays Catherine the Great. She appeared in nearly 100 films, was nominated for an Oscar 11 times and won twice (""Dangerous"" in 1935 and ""Jezebel""  in 1939), nominated for an Emmy 4 times and won once (""Strangers"" in 1979), 3 Golden Globe Nominations, and for ""All About Eve"" (1950) she won awards at Cannes, in Italy, and the New York Film Critics.

Macdonald Carey (1913-94) plays Patrick Henry. Carey is best known for his work on ""Days of Our Lives"" as Dr. Tom Horton (1965-89), but he did nearly 100 films.

This was the screen debut for Mia Farrow (1945) who's best known for her role in Rosemary's Baby (1968).

John Farrow (1904-63) directs. Farrow was the father of actress Mia Farrow with Margaret O'Sullivan (Jane from the Tarzan films). Farrow was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning for ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956) and nominated for ""Wake Island"" (1942).

Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) is responsible for the music. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appears on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

FWIW - Steiner worked on many scores for Bette Davis, but this film would be their last together.

In 1959 the big money makers were ""Ben Hur"", ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""North by Northwest"", ""Some Like it Hot"", and ""Pillow Talk"". The big Oscar winner was ""Ben Hur"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor). Other notable films released that year include ""Room at the Top"", ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", ""The 39 Steps"", ""The 400 Blows"", ""Anatomy of a Murder"", and ""The Last Angry Man"".

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said ""once more, the talents and resources of a lot of people and a large studio, John Farrow, writer-director, and a considerable cast of minor stars have been put to the tiresome task of shaping a flow of ponderous pictorial tableaus through which a solemn masculine figure, more myth than man, parades.""

My one and only favorite American Revolution film is John Ford's classic ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939). Most of the rest, like ""The Devil's Disciple"" (1959) and ""The Howards of Virginia"" (1940) are merely OK and some, like The Patriot"" (2000), are just plain silly. If you like Pre Revolution 18th Century American history, Michael Mann's breath-taking ""Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) is a great film from this period, as is King Vidor's ""Northwest Passage"" (1940).

There are so few films about the Revolution and none about John Paul Jones, so this otherwise mediocre film does bear watching.",1309824000,,4165,4.846478873239437
552371,4,6303039588,"It surprises me that so many terrible movies have been converted and released to a DVD format, while this excellent classic along with so many others have not for whatever reason.",1277596800,10,179,4.806451612903226
552372,3,6303039588,"Hollywood has certainly done much worse than this movie.  John Paul Jones was a major naval figure in the American Revolution, though seagoing operations in that war were overshadowed by land operations.  His life is covered with an acceptable degree of historical accuracy in this movie.  (It appears to me that the script was probably based on Augustus C. Buell's 1900 two volume ""biography"".  For the facts, trust Samuel Eliot Morison's unsurpassed 1959 biography of Jones.)  The normal artistic liberties are taken without changing the overall story.  The filming and color are quite good.  However, it suffers from very stiff acting, particularly from Robert Stack.  The VHS tape has also suffered the cutting room floor treatment by trimming a widescreen movie to fit the 4:3 TV screen.  Worth seeing once, it might be wisest to either rent or check it out from the library.",1170201600,19,880,5.055555555555555
552373,4,6303039588,"The only movie portrayal done to my knowledge of John Paul Jones.  That alone makes it worth while for any American history fan.  Robert Stack does a pretty good job as the man and soldier.  The movie is fairly historically  accurate with some ""Hollywood artistic"" liberty taken and a bit  of swashbuckling too.  An entertaining movie all in all.",948153600,24,346,4.779661016949152
552494,4,6303039588,"I enjoy historical movies and this is a childhood favorite. Robert Stack stoically plays the role of John Paul Jones but it still works. The supporting cast of  Marisa Pavan, Charles Coburn, Macdonald Carey, Jean-Pierre Aumont, David Farrar, Peter Cushing, Basil Sydney, Thomas Gomez and Bette Davis add breadth and life to the film. This was another of Samuel Bronston's Spanish studios epics and it certainly impresses in its look and authenticity. Get lost in history for awhile as you watch this film.",1455580800,,505,5.0843373493975905

552500,5,6303039588,"This is a fairly accurate story about the US Navy in Revolutionary War times. It was a time that politics was a tool used to get command of a sailing vessel and make it a war ship. John Paul Jones was probably the most experienced sea captain in that time but placed at the bottom of the list to get command. But he did get command, and used the ""Bonny Dick"" well. I enjoyed Charles Coburn as Ben Franklin, Betty Davis as Catherine the Great and Robert Stack as John Paul Jones, although Stack seems to play all his rolls in the same stiff manner. I wasn't prepared for Peter Cushing's appearance, he looked and sounded ""different"". Of course, Cushing went on to play a 'Grand' role in another 'Star' filled adventure.",1441152000,,718,4.446969696969697

552623,5,6303039588,"John Paul Jones is a very well produced historical drama that does an excellent job of portraying the life of John Paul Jones.  Most historical dramas tend to lose my interest because they tend to include too many poorly filmed segments interlaced through out.  This movie is not that way, it has great photography and acting through out.  The history is interlaced throughout the movie in an exceptional manner.

552683,4,6303039588,"I found myself thoroughly enjoying this enactment of the life of John Paul Jones.  If you like movies about Naval warfare,e.g. Errol Flynn etc, then you'll like this movie.  Some of the reviews I read on Amazon were more moderate in their praise, but I really liked this movie.  Battle scenes are believable.  The acting is good.",1391299200,,329,4.719298245614035
552684,5,6303039588,"The Warner Brothers Archive has preserved a classic movie in a DVD, with historic accuracy.  Robert Stack should be known more for his role as John Paul Jones, not the Untouchables.  As a young boy, John Paul Jones desired a life at sea in ships.  That dream became reality as he grew up to become a Captain in fledgling American Navy as a colonial commander.  In naval battle, he is known for the famous reply, ""I have just begun to fight!""  There was more to John Paul Jones, who was a favorite of the court in France, and trained the Russian Navy under Catherine the Great.  This is indeed a star spangled salute to a key player in the American Revolution and inspired the origins of a might U.S. Navy.  As a young lad, of middle school years as a BSA Sea Explorer Scout, I and others in a boat listened to accurate stories of John Paul Johns as told by a Navy Officer who was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.  The historical accuracy and actors of Colonial heroes in this DVD production revived a lot of those good memories and a good reminder of what America came from - individuals like us - we the people.",1390867200,4,1140,4.34433962264151

552688,5,6303039588,"I really enjoyed this film, so much so I have seen it several time before I decided to get my own. While the real man was not quite the goodie two shoes the film shows he was still one hell of a officer and there is no doubt in my mind he payed a major part in establishing the US Navy. Two points the film makes was the political actions that went with giving command to some who had little or no knowledge of the sea as opposed to experienced sea officers. The other was when he reported to Gen. Washington to resign his commission. What most people do not know was the Navy at that time belong to the Army and Washington commanded both. If your intrested in the founding of the best Navy in the world this is the film for you.",1383177600,,729,4.069444444444445
552689,5,6303039588,"John Paul Jones is A highly neglected and forgotten film. Robert Stack is excellent as a very stoic John Paul Jones and it works under John Farrow's direction. The score composed by Max Steiner is very notable. It is both rousing and very majestic. Of note, David Farrar and Peter Cushing demonstrate their great acting prowess in this film. It was also interesting to see Bette Davis as Empress Catherine the Great later on in the film. A lot of historical events are crammed into this film, some accurate and the stuff legends are made of and some not so accurate. But we are dealing with a great American legendary hero in this film and it accomplishes that feat of bringing him to the screen in great fashion.",1379635200,6,713,4.578125

But Benjamin Franklin (Charles Coburn) has a speech or two to give first.

He truly was one of the major  guiding forces behind the modern U.S. Navy.

This movie follows the life of the first great navel war hero of the United States of America. The story strays very little from the actual events only being condensed for the allotted time.

John Paul Jones was my first hero. When I was young I constructed a ship out of cardboard and wood and named it Ranger...JPJ's first U.S. command.

552744,3,6303039588,"This could have been an exciting movie, but, alas, it is only a lackluster effort to tell his story.  The movie spans the time when the 12 year old John Paul was apprenticed to Mr. Younger on a merchant ship out of Scotland in 1759 to his death in France in 1792.

A few miscellaneous notes:

John Paul's appended name:  John Paul added the name Jones after an incident on board his ship in Nassau, when he killed a crewman.  He left for Virginia to start over as John Paul Jones.

Cat-o'-nine-tails:  There is an odd scene when Jones has his first officer toss a cat-o'-nine-tails out of the Ranger's aft window.  This appears to be an oblique reference to an event - not shown in the film - when his ship's carpenter was severely flogged in 1770 at Tobago.  Perhaps this was to show his change in attitude for this form of discipline.

If you are a fan of the old Robin Hood TV series starring Richard Greene, you will find the actor, Archie Duncan, who played ""Little John"", plays a small part in this film; he looks and sounds like he had just stepped off the set from Robin Hood.

Early flag of the United States:  Check out the flag that John Paul Jones hoists on the Alfred.  This flag is commonly called the Grand Union Flag.  There is a picture of it on Wikipedia's web site.  It has no stars.
