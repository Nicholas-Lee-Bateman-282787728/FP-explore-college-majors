3770529,5,B001QU9RSO,Its great. The quality is good for the shows time. I wish they could for remastered it. I was better then i remember when it on the TV. The comedy was funny and all the actors were great. The only real bad thing is that the final season sucked. I wish I would of got all of the seasons but that one. The writers must not wanted to do the eight season. I guess you have to watch it to believe it did not live up to all the others. There was a few good ones in it tho.,1251504000,7,466,3.717171717171717
8336335,5,B001QU9RSO,"Just wanted to comment on my purchase of the Wings Complete series DVDs. First and for most I truly love and enjoy this show. It is such a comfort to be able to watch it, laugh and feel good, and go back later on and re-watch it again. Some of the wonderful jokes always stand out because they are so funny, and others I forget about until I watch again and laugh and laugh. Such a incredible show and worth every penny. So glad I made this purchase, and now I get to watch it anytime I want.",1408924800,,492,4.030612244897959
8336336,4,B001QU9RSO,"But almost $1,000 for all seasons? Are they kidding? I would love to own and watch every episode, but not at that price. Curious as to where other reviewers bought and how much they paid.",1397865600,,187,4.371428571428571

8336338,5,B001QU9RSO,"Amazon sells separate DVDs of season of ""Wings"" for ten bucks.  Keep looking and avoid paying this outrageous price for a ""set"" that is nothing but all of the separate seasons wrapped in shrink wrap together.  Honestly, you should not even allow people to sell a TV series for these astronomical prices here.",1391644800,,308,4.7924528301886795
8336339,3,B001QU9RSO,"this show was a good show, but the person that as it for sale is asking to much for it.  you could watch it for free on netflick why pay so much money",1389916800,,150,3.5454545454545454
8336340,5,B001QU9RSO,I loved this show back in the 90's and I still watch it and it cracks me up.  I like how all the characters work together and how silly and fun this show is.,1387929600,,157,3.6176470588235294
8336341,5,B001QU9RSO,"I became dissatisfied with TV fifteen or twenty years ago when prime-time viewing began featuring unfunny sitcoms, unreal reality shows and melodramatic dramas. At about that time they started producing DVDs of old shows, so I decided to collect the best of them.
 Wings was one of the best of them.
 To get an idea what a terrific situation comedy Wings was, consider this: The last two names on the shows credit list of eight stars during its final three (of seven) seasons were Tony Shalhoub (who late starred in Monk) and the very clever and attractive Amy Yasbeck.
 The show was first-class all the way, from the opening musical piece by classical composer Franz Schubert to the final scene.
 Unlike many sitcoms, which have hardly any story lines at all, the plots of Wings always were strong, but the characters carried the show. Brothers Joe and Brian Hackett (Tim Daly, Steven Weber), Helen Chapel Hackett (Crystal Bernard), Lowell Mather (Thomas Haden Church), Roy Biggins (David Schramm) and Fay Cochran (Rebecca Schull), Shalhoub and Yasbeck all delivered hilarious lines.
 Wings, unlike many recent sitcoms, did not resort to X-rated jokes to evoke laughs (Well, maybe there were a few Rs). This was, in my opinion, the greatest sitcom of all-time. After Wings, airports have never seemed the same.
Here are the top ten shows I watch most often in a delightful fare of prime-time DVD viewing: 1. Little House on the Prairie; 2. Touched by an Angel; 3. The Closer; 4. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman; 5. Bonanza; 6. Hawaii Five-0 (the original show with Jack Lord); 7. The Dick Van Dyke Show; 8. Highway to Heaven; 9. Wings; 10. Jackie Gleasons Honeymooners.",1384905600,,1683,4.870629370629371
8336342,5,B001QU9RSO,It's been so long since I've seen this show.  Completely fun and relaxing.  Great quality. It has a crazy way of making you feel part of the quirky cast.,1383955200,,153,4.241379310344827
8336343,5,B001QU9RSO,"This sitcom is such a pleasure. The scripts are funny without meaness or profanity with no overt sexuality that today's TV fodder is over run with.  The actors are wonderful.  They each crafted charactors that live and are true to their place in the story.  I wish this series had continued for many more years - as it is I will keep on enjoying these stories till the disks melt.  If you need a reprieve from the news, politics and wickedness of the world....take a trip on ""Sandpiper Air"", out of Nantucket.
Best wishes to the actors who graduated from this show: Tim Daly, Steven Weber, Tony Shalhoub, Rebecca Schull, David Schramm. Crystal Bernard, Amy Yasbeck and Thomas Hayden Church.  Bravo! Encore!",1381881600,2,706,4.754098360655738
8336344,5,B001QU9RSO,"This is a wonderful series, that only gets better the more you watch it! Each character is delightful, each contributes amazingly to the whole, and the writing is very witty. Some episodes are the best of farce, with line after line building the structure until it explodes in hilarity! So very fun!",1379721600,,299,4.769230769230769
