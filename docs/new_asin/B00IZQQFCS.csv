8646902,4,B00IZQQFCS,"This is a REGION B Blu Ray. The transfer is excellent, sound and picture. You need a Region Free player. Also this is sourced from 1080i material and will display PAL anomalies on an NTSC monitor. This willl show up as slight frame jumping on camera pans. If your monitor also displays PAL you will be OK. 1080p Blu Rays will not have issues on any type TV. You also get Quatermass 2 in hi def. Highly recommended.",1407283200,,414,4.32051282051282
