The scenes come into continuous contradiction: from the vivid Beirut night life to the rubbles left by the Israelis' strong bombardments and the mines deactivation (spread by the Israeli army) efforts in the South Lebanon fields, giving you the sense of the division this country is living into.

The initial part of the documentary is dedicated on the consequences this war has brought into the country, clear in everyone's sayings: from the young married couple who disagree with Hizballah politics -showing that not all Lebanese were for the Shia Group, however they all paid the price for this war - and the North Beirut Christian suburbs - who remained untouched by the bombing but whose tourist clientele disappeared following the war-; to both Christians and Muslims whose houses in the South were destroyed.

However, chaos divining the Lebanese becomes clear following the short interviews given by Lebanese people, representing with their sayings their religious sect opinion within the society: from the strong disagreement of the Christian militia old man who accuses Hizballah of initiating a war with Israel without asking anyone else, to the young Shia woman who talks about the ""Israeli animals"" who killed innocent people and depicts Hizballah as war heroes.

The words of the young man that the necessary thing for peace in Lebanon is ""not to talk about religion"" says it all and makes this documentary the most interesting one on the 33 day war and the Lebanese society schisms by far...",1235088000,2,1664,5.062043795620438
