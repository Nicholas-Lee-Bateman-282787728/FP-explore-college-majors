Load the DVD into the computer, drag each of the 101 files to a folder on your desktop, create a new playlist in iTunes, drag the files from your desktop, select burn playlist to cd, then select MP3 cd. This will burn all 101 radio episodes onto one cd, which will play on any car/truck CD player, which plays MP3 cds. It's easier than burning 50 standard cd's. Enjoy! I certainly am!",1477612800,3,403,4.45945945945946
