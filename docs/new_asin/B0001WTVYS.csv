8017222,4,B0001WTVYS,"Pretty interesting. I liked seeing Mardi Gras and the houses, floats/krewes, the cemetery, and the plantation tours.  Not too interested in some of the activities such as airboat rides or a flight above the swamps.",1455580800,,214,5.114285714285714

8017224,3,B0001WTVYS,"It's an okay travel DVD, but the emphasis is mostly on the Mardi Gras festivities and there is so much more to see and do in New Orleans.  One thing I did appreciate was that one of the sites we were going to see was on the DVD and I realized after seeing it that I did not want to spend the day going there, since the actual place was not what I had expected.  There is some variety but I would have preferred a little more emphasis on the cultural and less on the party festivities and drinking emphasis of Mardi Gras.",1406764800,3,520,4.038834951456311
8017225,3,B0001WTVYS,"The New Orleans DVD was OK, but it wasn't quite what I expected.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of a (pre-Katrina) pictorial tour-guide.  It dealt more with the party atmosphere.  The video quality was good.",1129075200,7,225,4.717948717948718
