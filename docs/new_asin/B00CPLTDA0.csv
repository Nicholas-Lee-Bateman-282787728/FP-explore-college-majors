5771841,3,B00CPLTDA0,"If you are looking for a zombie genre movie that doesn't completely suck this is a good one.  It's a B movie with a few cringe worthy spots, but the acting isn't terrible; don't get me wrong, there will be no Oscar winners out of this, but I've see much worse.

Without giving away too much, it's a nice departure from the overused urban zombie apocalypse, at least this one has some scenery. If you have any knowledge about the time period, forget it while you are watching this and you'll be fine.  I'm an historian and I kept having to remind myself it was a B grade movie.

Ending is a bit cliche, but what do you expect?",1398902400,2,625,4.226890756302521
5771842,3,B00CPLTDA0,"In 1349 during the Black Plague in Britain a group of knights lead by a priest (Feth Greenwood) are on a secret mission, which you already know is that they carry the Holy Grail which unfortunately is not an effective zombie weapon. They travel through the valley of the cursed, one that looks like it should have a wizard named ""Tim"" and a killer bunny with fangs, but it doesn't, just zombies.

Finally somebody got this Black Plague thing correct, it was zombies. I really was growing tired of that rat/flea/sanitation global warming nonsense. Eventually they encounter Badriyah (Vivien Vilela) a ""witch"" who knows some earth magic and more importantly how to deal with zombies. Oh yeah, there are some bad guys after them too.

The film is consumed with them traveling over desolate land. You can easily skip about the first 30 minutes. The movie shows ""hordes"" of zombies in the distant, but it was too low budget for them to hack up more than a half dozen or so at a time. For historical cheese ""Vikingdom"" is better. And for zombies, just pick one.

Great historical film. Should be on the ""The History Channel"" right after ""Noah's Ark.""

Sex and nudity (Vivien Vilela). Normally I don't comment on the sex scenes, but this one had an incredible amount of slurping kissing. It was funny to listen to.  3 stars for stupidity enjoyment.",1390953600,21,1341,4.713675213675214

5771844,3,B00CPLTDA0,"I absolutely love when filmmakers or authors can take a few liberties with history and create an entertaining horror story out of it.  Heck, Im even willing to overlook a few historical inaccuracies here and there if the story is good enough.  And if they can throw zombies in the mix?  WowIm definitely there.  The upcoming film release KNIGHT OF THE DEAD is a decent historical horror flick that is certainly worthy of checking out, however some viewers might not enjoy the low-budget aspect of it.

Personally, I enjoyed this film overall.  It does have its flaws, but they are primarily due to the lack of budget.  If you can look past that and take the film for what it is, you might actually enjoy it.

KNIGHT OF THE DEAD is shot decently however I think there are too many transition shots in certain scenes; this makes for a dizzying ride when you're trying to track the action onscreen.  Thankfully, this only happens a couple of times, so its not too terrible of a nuisance.

The acting is not bad, but its not great either.  I have certainly seen worse, for sure.  Likewise, the special effects are justthere.  Theres a lot of CG blood sprays and whatnot, which I do not like for the most part, however there are also several good practical effects shots as well.  A couple of characters are disemboweled, which looks pretty good onscreen.

I am disappointed with the zombie effects, however.  Theyre almost nonexistent.  Most of the zombies are just actors with faces painted white or greenand a few dabs of gunk or blood here and there.  If Im watching a zombie flick, I want to see rotting flesh and decay.

Several of the reviews I read for KNIGHT OF THE DEAD mentioned a lack of color in the film and how drab it looks.  Ive got news for those of you who didn't like that:  its pretty realistic for that time period, especially for knights on the road.  Theres not much to that countryside, and most of the warriors who traversed didn't prance about in bright colors.  They kept it plain and simple for the most part.  This didn't bother me at all in the film, but I felt like commenting on it anyway.

KNIGHT OF THE DEAD won't win any awards, but I found it entertaining nonetheless.  This is going to be one of those watch-for-yourself to judge flicks.  It hits store shelves next week if you want to give it a look.",1389571200,,2334,4.495238095238095

5771893,2,B00CPLTDA0,"This movie was so bad it was almost good . . . almost.  When you start watching it, the only way to track who these people are and what they are doing is by reading the plot synopsis on the Amazon page.  Several warriors with medieval-sounding names led by a generic priest character score a valuable object from a monk who inexplicably dies for no reason.  A big bad bald guy who talks like he knows he's a bad guy wants the object (which turns out to be the grail -- yawn) and somehow knows that these warriors have it.  Several mentions of plague are given, and you can make a drinking game out of how many times someone says ""This place is cursed!""
The fight scenes are mostly well-choreographed, even though the fighting style of the warriors is a mix between middle ages sword-fighting and mixed martial arts, but if you aren't bothered by their use of modern military hand-signals and colloquial catch-phrases, then that shouldn't bother you either.
The actors are not bad, but the writing is, so there's not much they can do about that.  The cinematography is not bad, either, but I'm baffled by the choice of grayscale and muted color tones.  I guess they were going for ""bleak,"" but like their overuse of the phrase ""This place is cursed,"" it's as subtle as a rock to the head.
I like how sincere it is in its attempt to mesh zombie horror with sword-swinging action, and it doesn't quite make the grade.  But it is fun and, like I said, a good drinking movie. I giggled all the way through it.",1435536000,3,1504,4.447272727272727

Early on they showed their prowess as fighters while defeating armed soldiers however, as the film wore on they couldn't even fend off limping rotting corpses who just wanted a free meal. As breathtaking as the acting was, the actual plot was a little more confusing.
There were a number of realistic questions that it generated. 1. Why did the zombies usually go for the intestines?  Of all the body parts these would likely be the least appetizing. 2. The bald headed stooge that was chasing the knights apparently knew about Zombie valley. Did he really have to go in there to end up on the menu? and lastly 3.

In this movie the quest is to take a historic religious artifact to safety and not to track down a witch who may be responsible for  resurrecting people back to life. This one has zombies that reanimate after death and being bitten by infected zombies.
The production values for this small budgeted movie are quite good for locations, cinematography, costumes, most of the special effects/makeup and direction. The two main areas that suffer somewhat are the acting and in the writing/dialogue departments that hurt an otherwise very good movie.
The movie has quite a bit of graphic violence sword/axe fight/kill scenes that include beheadings, eviscerations and canibalistic feedings, foul language is pretty much nonexistent and there was only one sex scene that showed upper body nudity of a man and woman. There was one other scene that may or may not have been an attempted rape of an infected woman that was fully clothed.

On their journey they run into a witch, who's being followed by some bad guys, not sure what their role in the film was, the movie doesn't do anything to explain much really. Just think of it as a medieval hack and slash zombie film, get a pint of mead or ale and enjoy the gorefest.",1496534400,,688,4.259541984732825

How about horrible acting, costumes not of the period and most probably an 8 year old kid running the camera. The fight scenes only needed  ""Wham, bop, pow"" pasted across the screen like the old TV Batman of the 70s.
I couldn't fast forward fast enough.",1490572800,3,408,4.666666666666667
8588930,3,B00CPLTDA0,"okay, I like zombie movies. The beginning of this movie was very hard to track and everything that happened was almost distracting.  Somewhere in the middle it kind of gels and now it's more focused.  Suffer through the first half and it becomes more tolerable.",1488240000,,261,4.777777777777778

Other reviewers have pointed out that this movie started off with lots of potential, decent acting, and moody atmosphere.  In my opinion, it peaked about about the time the large mobs of Z's began appearing; this is where the movie lost most of it's reasons to watch.",1486080000,,405,4.445945945945946

I view these as time wasters, I'll put it on while I'm doing something else. Overall, I enjoyed it from the ""B"" movie perspective.
