5532128,4,B00AZMFM3I,"This movie was about a lot of things, and probably needs to be watched more than once to grasp all of what it was about.

1. It was about the intersection of Men of Action who actually ran the Shin Bet and had boots on the ground with the Men of Words who constitute the political class. (What happens when intelligence/military agencies are run by civilians?) The most dramatic example of this came about 2/3 of the way through the movie, when there was argument about ""how it might look"" to kill all of the Senior Hamas Leadership because it happened to all be in one place.  Finally, instead of dropping a one ton bomb on the place that would kill everyone, a ""compromise"" was settled on in which a quarter ton bomb would be dropped-- and that allowed almost everyone to get away unscathed.
2. It was about the separate sectors of Israeli Society and how they interact with each other. The Military. The Rabbanut. The Government.
3. It was about taking moral questions a bit too far. And this was most dramatically illustrated when one of these washed up, retired men asked questions about how to handle people who had hijacked a bus with civilians on it (!) and if killing the hijackers was the right thing to do.
4. It was about the secular against the Religious Zionists. (The people who killed Rabin were clearly Religious Zionists, but I think I saw exactly one government official wearing a kippah.) The Religious Zionists did not see Yitzhak Rabin as one of them-- at least not enough to spare his life.
5. It was about Jewish acumen. There entire film was in Modern Hebrew (except for a few Anglicisms that were thrown in by some of the interviewees and one rally that was, for some reason, in English). It's easy to forget that it only recently became a spoken language-- that was then developed into something universally understood. There was also the 6 day war and the sheer volume of intellectual fortitude involved in gather the intelligence for these many operations.

The movie definitely had an agenda. There have been many people who have worked for Shin Bet, and it is interesting that they just happened to find the few of them that apologized for the work that they did and were willing to entertain an extended moral discussion. And to state that self defense did not work.

Verdict: Worth the time and worth the price ($3.99 online viewing.)",1485648000,,2367,4.628571428571429

They acknowledged their own imperfection, guilt and regret, but most moving was to see and hear these men, past their prime, questioning whether the killing and mayhem they had ordered in the name of a patriotic ideology had any meaning at all.

It's well made and we both found it interesting. A word of warning though-it is definitely a documentary style film, so if you just want a guns-blazing action thriller, than this is not for you.

5532383,5,B00AZMFM3I,"One of the best documentaries I have seen on Israeli policy toward Palestine. I knew the documentary won many awards, but I was still pleasantly surprised. Most of the documentary consists of the ex Shin Bet heads telling their personal views, with some historical footage thrown in. So it's basically six clearly very intelligent, very serious and passionate men - talking to you as the viewer. Very powerful.

What I found amazing is that despite their different personalities, despite the different political climates and historical backdrops to their terms of service, they all agreed on a few key things: 1) that peace is the key goal 2) that continuing conversations with the other side, even if considered ""terrorist,"" is necessary for any kind of peace arrangement to be possible, 3) it is the political establishment of Israel that continually undermines the cooperative security efforts of the Shin Bet with the Palestinian Authority, because of short-term political interests. The last point really stood out. It made me very cynical about the personal political motivations of politicians, and I didn't get the impression that the Shin Bet were just covering their backs - they admitted to making their own mistakes and substantiated their arguments.

Also, what I understood from the interviews is that all of these guys worked in the field. Some of the comments on this documentary that I've read have mentioned that it's just the opinions of a bunch of high-up bureaucrats...that was definitely not my take away. My impression was that all of these guys saw field action and then made it to the top, with lots of first hand knowledge of how the Palestinian population thinks and operates. If you liked this documentary, you might also enjoy two other award-winning documentaries, Waltz with Bashir, and The Green Prince (based on the book Son of Hamas.)",1417824000,,1868,5.0814332247557

I was still then too consumed with my career to be following situations like this in any depth and had forgotten he had been taken out by a radical Israeli.

They also recognize that radical Jews blowing up the Temple Mount will bring the whole thing down on them all.

5532436,5,B00AZMFM3I,"The Gatekeepers is a documentary by a 1st time director Droh Moreh,who got Shin Bet's 6 former directors to just sit and speak about their time as leaders of the internal security operations, they undertook since the Six- Day War in 1967. They related they had no initial comprehension of anti-terrorism or of what was a terrorist. After the war the expansion of borders led to an extra million potentially hostile Palestinians in the occupied territories to control. They explain how daily duties involved life-or-death decisions: the order to fire could take out an enemy terrorist,but what about any innocent individuals travelling with them,passers-by on the street,families could suffer in the collateral damage?What is life-if it can be snuffed out in an instant,yet the memories linger for years?These men remember waking whole families up in the middle of the night and feel bad about that. They also acknowledge after the 1st Intifada they used more coercive techniques to make them deliver information:sleep deprivation,cramped cells, shaking their brains in their skulls.

Avraham Shalom had a bad reputation: ordering the murder of 2 unarmed terrorists,he asks what is morality to a terrorist? ""It's not a moral problem,it's a tactical problem. In the war vs. terror, forget about morality.""He resigned after this. Another says ""It's like we've won all the battles,but lost the war"".Israel has resorted too much to military force and not engaged enough in genuine negotiations with the Palestinians. They also felt that the politicians didn't care about Shin Bet,left them on their own. Their chief point: they had no way of predicting the 1st Intifada,nor the assassination of Yitzbak Rabin. They mourn the latter,the only PM who went forward on the political plane,working for a historical compromise,a real settlement with the Palestinians. He was assassinated ('95) by a Jewish fanatic,who they cite as changing the course of history.

The Jewish Underground is shown being stopped from blowing up buses with 250 Palestinians on and stopped from blowing up the Dome of the Rock. If this had gone ahead the whole of the Arab world would have turned on the Israelis and the international community. It's emphasised there are extremists on all sides. Although the Jewish radicals were all imprisoned ,due to connections with the establishment,they were soon released. Showing blood is thicker as with support for the settlers. We also know that the state of Israel was recognised in 1948,yet 66 years after they were thrown out of their own country,the Palestinians still wait to be recognised as a state.

The context of the film is the 1967 war,with the society before being idealistic and socialist,joining the army was a noble thing. After 1967 Israel is transformed into a colonial empire,when everything changed,with the I.D.F. becoming a brutal police force of the colonial power. Sin Bet expanded massively,recruiting a whole army of Palestinian informants and collaborators. The retired Sin Bet leaders are hard men and didn't think about the things they now talk about. They thought what they did was valid,getting to know the occupied Palestinians in their occupied lands of the West Bank and Gaza. They did cruel things and they speak about their operations candidly. Their main criticism is of the political leadership of Israel since 1967. They say they did their job,all the dirty work,the suppression of terrorism,but that alone doesn't resolve the conflict. They say they gained time for the politicians to engage in negotiations,but the longer the war goes on,the more enemies are created. No longer Al Fatah but Al Quaeda-linked groups,a more militarised Hamas,the threat greater. The arms have grown,when it all started with rock-throwing. Hate engenders hate.

The consensus among the interviewees is they should have moved long ago out of the occupied territories,but they didn't act upon this and tell their government to pursue certain policies. They say the war is making Israel a crueller society,its hurting the Israelis themselves. The Palestinians too,call victory making the Israelis suffer,due to the process of continuous colonization,becoming more entrenched with the growth of the settlements on the West Bank. The balance is between security for the Israelis and sovereignty for the Palestinians,if you have more of one you get less of the other. The real challenge thrown up by this film is the lack of courage in the political leadership required to make heroic choices and painful decisions for unilateral withdrawal,when the coalition government is based on settler support. But leadership is required on both sides,coordinated with moderate Arab forces and the international community.

Anyway, all the leaders come to the same conclusion to the central theme of the documentary: Israel is handling the Palenstinian issues totally incorrectly.  It is a stunning confession that is made even more stunning by the concensus among all of them.  I am not trying to advocate one side or the other here.

5532564,5,B00AZMFM3I,"One might expect a documentary movie based on interviews of six former heads of Israel's Shin Bet (their internal security intelligence force) to be a rah-rah cheering section for Israel's largely successful war against Arab/Palestinian terrorism, and there is indeed some of that, a sense of satisfaction for having essentially defeated the worst of what the terrorists had to offer.

But at the end, there is only a sense of frustration and foreboding at lost opportunities and a dark and uncertain future ahead, due to Israel's failure to achieve a lasting peace with the Palestinians, a failure largely attributable to the increasingly strident and dominant ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious factions in Israel's political process.

It was a member of this faction who assassinated Yitzhak Rabin, and ""changed history"", in the words of one of the former chiefs (who had failed in his job to protect Rabin), thus derailing the peace process permanently.

Later, another ultra-nationalist Israeli group plotted to blow up the sacred Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, to clear the way for a Jewish Third Temple on its grounds, an event which would have brought down the wrath of the entire Muslim world upon Israel and the Jews.  The plotters were arrested, but then  quickly freed by their powerful political allies, and went unpunished.

The movie ends with these dark foreboding thoughts, and it is clear that these former heads of Shin Bet uniformly see that the greatest threat to Israel now is not from the Arabs/Palestinians, who they have learned how to control, but from Israel's own increasingly powerful and mainstreamed ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious factions.

And why not?  One only has to read the history of ancient Israel, of the last two times Israel existed as a nation and then was extinguished (by the Babylonians and the Romans).  The end came in both cases when extremists took control of the political process in Israel, seeking conflict to achieve a righteous goal,  and then were crushed.",1395705600,3,2021,5.171779141104294
5532565,3,B00AZMFM3I,A view into Israel's counter terrorism forces. Some actual file footage of destruction that was ordered. A lot of philosophical views of six former heads of Shin-bet.

5532566,4,B00AZMFM3I,"This documentary consists of a series of interviews with former heads of Shin Bet, the Israeli Secret Service.  They outline their work in protecting the country's interests, especially since the Six Day War of 1967, while reflecting on the morality of their actions.  The film illustrates some of their maneuvers with the help of archive footage and reconstructions.  What makes THE GATEKEEPERS so intriguing is its contradictory viewpoints; on the one hand many of those interviewed believe that it is their duty to protect Israeli interests at all costs, even if it means incurring collateral damage.  If they targeted a particular Palestinian suspect, they accepted as a matter of course that innocent people would get killed, however much they tried to pinpoint their campaign.  While accepting to an extent the Palestinian claims to their own separate state, the interviewees nonetheless have a jaundiced view of the methods their rivals employ: why should Palestinians believe they have achieved their revenge simply by making the Israelis suffer?  Yet perhaps what is most interesting is the way in which the interviewees criticize their own government for perpetually pursuing militarist policies, and refusing to meet the Palestinians round the negotiating-table in a sustained way.  The Oslo accords of the mid-Nineties represented a step in the right direction, but they collapsed within seven years.  Since then, most Israeli Prime Ministers have been preoccupied with pursuing aggressive policies against the Palestinians.  The interviewees understand that they, the Israelis, are the colonists, adopting modes of behavior which they themselves experienced in the past  at the hands of the British.  Perhaps greater care needs to be taken in the future about pursuing a more liberal policy; but the interviewees seem fairly pessimistic about this actually happening.  THE GATEKEEPERS might not be a particularly dramatic film, but it is an invaluable text that helps to unravel the complexities underlying the Israel-Palestine conflict.",1393804800,,2050,5.514376996805112

You can't have peace unless you have a willing partner. Israel would like nothing better than to have peace and prosperity in the region, while the Palestinians only want Israel to go away. While none of the players are perfect, the Palestinians do not want Israel to exist as a nation in the region.

overviews of how it does its job (protecting Israelis from terrorism), and why
they all realize that their agency is not the solution to anything but mainly an
interim measure until a better political solution is found.  One can expect that
they probably started from a very conservative position.  But those actually tasked
with getting things done...especially those at the top who have the broadest
picture of what is going on, tend not to stay in any fixed ideological position.

What makes this quite remarkable is that these six men are the surviving heads of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service. One admits he ordered the execution of two bus hijackers in 1984, which led to his resignation. Another says he was happy the Intifada started because it gave Shin Bet something to do. As the documentary progresses you keep having to shake your head and realise these people are not anti-Israeli protestors but the people in charge of keeping the country safe. If this film is to be believed, Shin Bet (which gave its operatives the best Arab-language training possible) was so expert that before it started infiltrating a certain neighbourhood it had already identified the people it thought would be good collaborators. The men talk openly about how to best order an air strike against your enemies and discuss various past successes and failures. What comes through very clearly is the disdain for politicians over the decades. Netanyahu has no agenda, says one former Shin Bet head.

5532718,3,B00AZMFM3I,"Review of The Gatekeepers - A Documentary:

Having written several novels involving the Israeli secret services, I found this movie irresistibly interesting as it contains interviews with key Israeli spy figures. However, while this movie purports to be a documentary, its clever editing, designed to support its heavy-handed political theme, makes it less faithful to historic facts than many novels. That's unfortunate, because this is truly a rare and exceptional peek into an otherwise secret world.

The Gatekeepers is a documentary consisting mostly of short clips from long interviews with six former chiefs of the Israeli domestic security agency (""Shin Bet"") (the equivalent to the FBI in the United States). In between, there are short snippets of video footage, mixing real historic material with dramatized clips of unexplained origin.

In its essence, The Gatekeepers is a well-done yet lengthy political op-ed for the position that Israel's ""occupation"" of the West Bank and Gaza is the reason for lack of peace in the Middle East and has a corrupting effect on Israelis. Many of the interview clips seem to have been cut by the movie editor and taken out of context in order to support this central political theme.

The weakness in this ""blame it on the occupation"" concept, obviously, is its contradiction of historic facts: The Arab war on the Jews in Palestine started a century ago, long before Israel was even established (in 1948), which was two decades before Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza (in 1967). (My novel, The Jerusalem Inception, chronicles the dramatic events leading to that war, known as the Six Days War.)

Current events don't help this theory either: Israel has long ago handed over Gaza and most of the West Bank to the Palestinians, who not only have continued to fight Israel, but have since commenced a lengthy war with each other, pitting Hamas against Fatah in a sad mirror of the wider, tragic conflicts between secularists and Islamists, as well as Sunni and Shia believers. Furthermore, the constant state of war in the greater Middle East, currently flaring up in Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt, also proves the irrelevance of this minor ""occupation"" to the greater Mideast perpetual state of war.

An excellent review of this movie, which addresses these issues, appears in The Jerusalem Post at jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/The-dishonesty-of-The-Gatekeepers

That said, The Gatekeepers is truly impressive in having drawn these six powerful, clandestine men out of their stealthy dens to speak on camera with such passion, reflection and sincerity. The well-informed viewer would understand the historic background: a century-long struggle of the Jewish people to defend against tireless Arab attacks. Therefore, notwithstanding the caveats mentioned above, The Gatekeepers is well-worth watching - not as a comprehensive factual documentary, but as a thought provoking peek into a secret and morally complex world of covert warriors who rarely speak in public.

5532815,4,B00AZMFM3I,"Those with a deep and abiding interest in the problems of the Middle East will find much food for thought in ""The Gatekeepers,"" an Oscar-nominated documentary about the Israeli intelligence agency known as Shin Bet. And those who are but casual observers of that part of the world may learn a thing or two as well.

The selling point of the movie is that for the first time ever it managed to get a number of the past leaders of Shin Bet to comment on their experiences with the organization. Directed by Dror Moreh, the movie begins with the Six Day War in 1967, goes through the various periods of turmoil and attempts at peacemaking that have gone on there through the decades since (including the assassination of Rabin), and ends in the present day when technological advancements have made surgical drone strikes the preferred weapon of choice in the seemingly never-ending battle against terror. As such, the movie provides a fascinating and surprisingly cohesive history of life in that geopolitical hotspot over the past half-century, all without any voiceover narration, using only the extemporaneous words and comments of the men who played such a major part in that history.

In moments of intense self-reflection, the men offer surprisingly candid comments regarding what they've had to do in their role as protectors of the nation. They re not afraid to delve into the grayer areas of the issues, for instance expressing regret over the ""collateral damage"" of innocents often caught in the crossfire of war, admitting to the mistreatment of prisoners, and agonizing over the dehumanization that results from sectarian prejudice and fighting. A number of them ponder the distinct differences in motive and approach between the politicians setting the policies and the people assigned to carry them out. Above all, to a one, the men reserve their harshest criticism for themselves, Shin Bet and their own country, often expressing sympathy for the Palestinians for what they've had to endure under Israeli occupation and questioning much of what Shin Bet and they themselves have done over the years, the mistakes they`ve made. Most agree that the most important thing Israel can do is to keep talking to its enemies. As such, I can't imagine this film went over too well with the hardliners in that country. As one of the men says, the farther one gets from one's time as leader of Shin Bet, the more ""leftist"" one becomes.

I don't know if that's true, but it makes for a fascinating theory. And there are many more unexpectedly eye-opening and paradigm-shifting moments to be found in ""The Gatekeepers.""",1375142400,3,2618,4.972602739726027

5532818,4,B00AZMFM3I,"Its good to see this doco out on DVD, as it only received a limited release in the cinemas. I was finally able to rent it on DVD last night.

My impressions: firstly, anyone wanting either a pro- or anti-Palestinian/Israel diatribe should steer clear, as this film avoids the sort of grand narratives you see in the usual propaganda pieces on this topic. Instead the film consists of interviews with the heads of the Shin Bet interspersed with video footage of key incidents in Shin Bet history. Most of the responses given by the interviewees consist of short, pithy observations that leave a lot unsaid, and even though some of the Shin Bet men give better interviews than the others it is clear that all of them are still somewhat cagey about saying anything at all.

For example, the interviewer spends several minutes pressing one of the men on a particular incident where two Palestinian prisoners were killed - apparently murdered - after being captured by the Shin Bet. Quite dramatically, one of the interviewees tacitly admits that he is the man that gave the order for the Palestinian prisoners to be killed. However, it took some googling for me to work out what all of this was about - apparently it was something called the ""Bus 300 affair"" according to Wikipedia. Israelis would probably know all of this instinctively, American audiences not so much.

This film has taken quite a few cheap shots in the media - for instance, it is true that one of the Shin Bet heads compares modern Israel to 1940s Germany, but he quickly qualifies this response by saying that this comparison was not aimed at Germany's treatment of Jews but rather Germany's occupation of Belgium, France and Czechoslovakia. So the accusation that the film compares Israel's treatment of the Palestinians to the holocaust is untrue and unjustified.

On the whole, however, it is clear that the men have all come to similar conclusions following their time in the Shin Bet and the film in this respect does have a political message. One of the interviewees says that it is impossible to spend a lot of time in the Palestinian territories and not come out of it ""a bit of a leftist"". It seems clear that the current detente in the Palestinian territories can only continue for as long as the Palestinians can hope that there is still a prospect of there ever being a negotiated peace. It is also easy to see the frustration and impatience that the men have for the Jewish settlers who have made the situation between Israel and the Palestinians much more intractable.

5532825,4,B00AZMFM3I,"The film offers interviews with the last six heads of Shin Bet, Israel's secretive state security service. Despite being largely sympathetic to the men, their interviews were laced together very well to show inconsistencies in their responses. As is common in interviews with governmental officials, politicians are not shown in a very favorable light. However, the film makes it clear that Shin Bet was not blameless in the things that happened.

I think this is a documentary that would benefit many Americans, if not others, as it gives a very different perspective on Israel's history than can be found anywhere else. As an American who is very interested in understanding the state of affairs in the Middle East, and who is just starting to see the ""darker side"" of Israel, I found this documentary very useful and interesting.

The biggest reason this is not rated five stars is that it was hard to remember which of the men corresponded with which years as directors of the Shin Bet.

5532826,5,B00AZMFM3I,"Six leaders of Israel's domestic security department Shin Bet are interviewed in this acclaimed documentary. Accompanied by archival newsreels the burden of command is etched in their faces. Tactics rather than  strategy governed the operations in the early days. However the contemporary world of suicide bombing, Intifada, and realpolitik  demanded different, but no less principled responses.

These men protected the security of their nation. They were warriors  and yet each was open to thoughtful analysis of his role on an illusive road to peace. One of the six admitted that job of combating Israel's foes ultimately turned all of them into leftists. However, clearly each of them would serve their country again and exercise the terrible powers of life or death the office required.",1365292800,20,791,5.354838709677419
5532827,5,B00AZMFM3I,"""The Gatekeepers"" (2012 release from ISrael; 95 min.) brings an unparalleled look into Israel's Shin Bet, the internal security agency tasked with protecting Israel from terrorists and other outside dangers. Incredibly, writer-director Dror Moreh was able not only to meet with and talk to 6 former heads of Shen Bet (covering 1980 to 2011, they are Ami Ayalon, Avi Dichter, Yuval Diskin, Carmi Gillon, Yaakov Peri, and Avraham Shalom), but Moreh then convinced them to talk on record, and on camera!

While the documentary does not strictly play pout chronologically, the early segments do focus more on the 'early' days following the Six Day War. Comments one of them: ""we didn't get any direction from the politicians, we had to figure out for ourselves what to do"". That gets solved when the era of terrorism becomes more pronounced. Shin Bet surveys, infiltrates and uses any means possible to get information on potential plots and strikes, and none of the former heads apoligizes for it (""there is no morakity when dealing with a terrorist"", comments one). Shin Bet scores many victories yet suffers one of is lowest moments ever in 1995 with the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin by someone whom Shin Bet never had even an inklin about. The most interesting, and likely controversial, part of the documentary focuses on the Israeli-Palestine conflict. Despite the use of information-gathering methods that some might question, all six former heads make clear their disgust with the politicians on all sides, and they seem perplexed that there still is no resolution for this conflict. When asked if Israel should continue talks with all sides, including Hamas (a terrorist organization), they all are clear: YES!

This movie raises many pointed questions about the security threats that Isreal faces on a day-to-day basis, and is nothing short of a MUST-SEE for anyone interested in the Israeli-Palestine conflict. The screeing I saw this at this past weekend here in Cincinnati was PACKED. This movie was up for a Best Documentary Oscar earlier this year, and with good reason (even if it lost the Oscar to ""Searching for Sugar Man""). Bottom line: ""The Gatekeepers"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1364688000,25,2209,5.133333333333334
5532828,2,B00AZMFM3I,"For quite some time I was waiting for this documentary to come out. Being very pro Israel and very interested in Israeli (military) history, I imagined this to be one of those documentaries that would end up on my own collection's shelves. However, after just seeing this leftist documentary in the theatre, I can share that this definitely will not be the case! What starts out as a interesting documentary as advertised about the Shin Bet ends with the derogatory comment of one of the ex-Shin Bet agents,  comparing current Israel with Nazi Germany, in how it treated the non Jewish people under their occupation. Leading up to this in the documentary,there is an increasing barrage of the terms that anti Israel people love like ""settlements"" and ""occupation""...it sneaks up on you, but then it seems to be all you hear and almost seems to become the overtone of this documentary, which I could have sworn was going about the Shin Bet. Anyway, this documentary is lost on me, and with this, be warned.

Intrigued (and happy to hear from the aforementioned friend) I asked what this was about, even though two words had already formed in my mind: The Gatekeepers. I can't imagine a better way to spend 90 minutes on a Friday other than listening to the former heads of Shin Bet talk about their organization and their beliefs about morality. Very powerful stuff came from Avraham Shalom; he raises some very interesting points. I'd love to sit down with him and talk Israel over a warm cup of whole milk.
