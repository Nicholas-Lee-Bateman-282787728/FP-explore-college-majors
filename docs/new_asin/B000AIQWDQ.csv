2388960,4,B000AIQWDQ,"EVIL (Ondskan) is a tough story from the novel by Jan Guillou that in screenwriter Hans Gunnarson's adaptation and Mikael Hfstrm's direction becomes an intensely interesting while terrifying film about all aspects of evil.  It is intelligent, gritty, and transforming simultaneously and has become one of the more powerful coming of age films of this decade.

Erik Ponti (Andreas Wilson) is a young high school lad, the son of a 'blind eye' mother and a viciously abusive father, who makes his way through school by fighting. After a particularly dangerous fight Erik is expelled and in order for him to matriculate into a university  he is sent to an academy where he encounters the controlling student leader Otto Silverhielm (Gustaf Skarsgrd) who quickly informs him that the discipline of the school is left in the hands of the students: the faculty elects to overlook the shenanigans of the students in favor of teaching in a self-imposed vacuum.  Erik is assigned a roommate Pierre Tanguy (Henrik Lundstrm) who is Erik's opposite: Pierre reads and studies and advocates the non-violence of Gandhi  while Erik focuses on his athletic prowess in swimming and tries to submerge his pugilistic nature.  But as the school year progresses Erik discovers the extreme evil of the students who govern the student body by violent skirmishes and humiliation of the undergrads. Erik becomes a school champion swimmer, a feat that only draws the envy and hate of Otto and his henchmen and 'times in the ring' bring out Erik's fighting responses. He can take care of himself but when the violence turns toward Pierre, his only friend, he gathers the courage to confront the faculty with the student goon squad activities. Erik has broken a cardinal rule: he is attracted to Marja (Linda Zilliacus), the kitchen help, resulting in Marja's losing her job AND she is pregnant with Erik's child.  Erik is expelled, returns home to his supportive but copeless mother, has one final fight with his abusive father, and returns to his school to unmask the realities of student activities that shock the faculty.  How this change affects Erik and those that he respects and loves brings some surprises to the ending of this film.

Andreas Wilson offers a multifaceted performance that reminds this viewer of the young James Dean.  He is able to make an essentially negative person into someone about whom we care very much.  Likewise, Henrik Lundstrm molds his character with dignity, humor and honor and is the perfect foil for Wilson's transformation.  The cinematography by Peter Mokrosinski and the musical score by Francis Shaw add exactly the right atmosphere for this daring little drama.  Highly recommended.

2388961,5,B000AIQWDQ,"""Evil"" is a very unique film, in that it is not just foreign, but because of that, it's subject matter is treated in a VERY different way than we are used to seeing, here in the U.S. It is first and foremost, a story of a troubled teen, who has very serious anger issues. Apart from that, however, is an underlying viciousness that young adults seem to harbor in a scholastic setting.

We see Erik, a handsome boy, who seems to vent his pent-up rage upon other teenagers at his local school. After a conference with other school heads, Erik is expelled. It appears that Erik has no other recourse, but to ""drop-out"". This means a bleak existence for Erik, as in all other countries, a dropout has limited choices as to employment. It is here, that we are witness to Erik's homelife.
His Mother is understandably concerned for Erik's future. She sells some of her prized possessions to raise the money to send Erik to a private school, so Erik still has a chance. Erik's Stepfather is not so accomodating. He seems to have a penchant for punishing Erik for even the most insignificant of ""transgressions"". It is here, as well, that we understand why Erik is the way he is. It seems that Erik is punished by belt just about every evening.
Then comes the day Erik leaves for his new school. All appears well at first, as he is shown around the campus grounds by an upperclassman. He reluctantly settles into his dorm room and gets to know his ""bunkie"". Now comes the part that let's Erik know that he has been thrown into a wasp's nest. There are R-U-L-E-S he must follow, to get along (not much has changed, as it is remeniscent of his home life).
Scholastically, Erik is a model student! He is bright, adept physically as well as mentally, and excells. The rules however, become a bane to Erik's existence. He must now do demeaning things that have no apparent purpose (much like ""hazing""), other than to push Erik into either confrontation, or compliance. Erik has a complete understanding of the difference between punishment and cruelty, and won't stand for any of it.
It's not much of a stretch to say that Erik has now become the school whipping boy.
One day Erik gets to know one of the school's serving girls (which is forbidden), and falls in love. It is difficult to maintain a relationship, because of their differing schedules, but Erik tries his best, as it is the only positive thing he can look forward to.
Then the hammer falls. It is now open season on Erik! To his credit, Erik takes things in stride, as difficult as it is, because he knows that this school is his last chance, and he will not waste his Mother's money by being a failure. All bets are off, however, when an upperclassman finds out about Erik's Liaison with the serving girl, and reports it to the School Head.
What happens next is surprisingly rewarding. I cannot go further, so as not to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it yet. ""Evil"" won many Film Festival awards, and it is easy to see why. Because it is in Swedish with English subtitles, there are many who will not watch it, simply because they do not like reading subtitles! It is their loss, as ""Evil"" is a very entertaining film!

There are deleted scenes, as well as a ""making of"" featurette that is very interesting, because it lends insight into the Swedish mindset that created the story for filming.

Easily a five-star film!!",1206316800,5,3384,4.53518821603928

2388964,5,B000AIQWDQ,"It is strange to realize that this story takes place at ""normal"" schools in Sweden, not in a special correction institution as British-produced ""Scum"", for instance, does.

However, not physical fitness and achievements on personal merits but money and social connections rule a local perverted world of stoolies eventually reflecting a reality of one of the last monarchist societies in educated Europe.

Self gender affairs and underage sexuality have been deployed as very basic behavioral constituents of characters screened, far departed from usual images of elitist families' boarding school pupils.

2388965,5,B000AIQWDQ,"Erik Pontil is a bully at his high school. After severely beating up another student, he is expelled and sent to a private school, which is his last chance to get into a university. At home, he suffers from regular beatings by his step-father. When at the new school, he tries to lead a peaceful life but is, instead, tormented by the older students, who give him no chance but to fight back.

What I really like about this movie is that it shows how bullying really is a fault of society. In real life, people say they disagree with bullying but really support the bully when the action occurs. In the movie, whenever underclassmen get victimized by the seniors, the public supports the bullies, and chears them on in the box.

I think the real message of the movie is that the real law of our world is the survival of the fittest. Some are less fortunate and cannot defend themselves against bullies but others, like Erik, can fight for themselves. At the end, no one will fight for you. The only way to defeat bullying is to become stronger and fight off the bully. If you don't fight, you will be considered the villain as society will view you as weak and cowardly and look up to the bully.

Human nature is weak and inherently evil. The strongest law is the law of the fittest survive.",1162339200,11,1291,4.415966386554622
2388966,4,B000AIQWDQ,"I would recommend Ondskan to anyone who is interested in coming-of-age films. American cinema has always been expert at such portrayals, and it is good to see so accomplished an example out of Sweden. I liked especially the fact that the director never wavers as he unmasks the unwholesome face of an angst-ridden, violence-prone, socially intransigent Swedish society of the not so long ago . Set in the fifties, mostly at a posh boarding school for the upper-class, where the sixth-form boys, led by an effete Swedish aristocrat, set about enforcing their arbitrary and violent rules while the faculty turn a blind eye, this film cleverly avoids the hooks, punches and triumphs of the underdog come to grips with the jack-booted status quo via his fists alone by allowing him to prevail to justice through the intervention of Swedish law. There are enough fisticuffs along the way, however, to satisfy the blood-thirsty among you. Well-acted, good script, beautiful cinematographic moments.",1154995200,10,992,5.20625
2388967,5,B000AIQWDQ,"In 1857 Thomas Hughes published ""Tom Brown's Schooldays"", which despite the unassuming title (or the sunny illustration on the current edition's front cover) is actually a bitter indictment of the brutality that Hughes saw as rampant in the 19th century British public school system. Jan Guillou's 1981 autobiographical novel, ""Ondskan"" -- of which ""Evil"" is the film version -- takes on mid-1900s Swedish boarding schools in a similar way. As with their British counterparts, at the Swedish schools it was the boys themselves who enforced the rules. The upper-classmen would act as harsh disciplinarians for the students in the lower forms, while teachers and administrators saw their duty to be only what their job descriptions entailed: teaching and administering.

As a film version of Guillou's book, ""Evil"" is very accomplished indeed. The main character, Erik, is a bully who after regular beatings at home at the hand of his stepfather has come to take the same violent approach with his classmates. Due to constant fighting he is expelled from one high school after another, until finally it is left to his mother to sell off some of the family's prized possessions to pay for his tuition at an elite boarding school. This is the only school that will now accept him, and at a steep price. Knowing that the year at this school will be his last chance to graduate and move on to college, Erik is determined to get through it without another expulsion. At the same time he is also determined not to become victim to the traditional brutality that he soon discovers permeates the school. It is the tension between these two objectives that drives the story of ""Evil"".

The upper-classmen at his new boarding school quickly realize what they've got in Erik, and in response they continually raise the stakes in their obsession over making him submit. What results are scenes combining cruelty, brutality, and downright disgust (one episode involving a late-night visit by the upper-classmen to Erik's room is definitely not for the squeamish.) We also at times feel keen frustration at having to watch Erik put up with the various mistreatments, especially knowing that if he did fight back he could easily subdue any of these upper-classmen.

Lead actor Andreas Wilson's characterization of Erik is masterful, evoking the anger that drives him while also showing that as an individual he is far too complex to be dismissed as simply ""evil"". After the years of mistreatment by his stepfather (explaining not only the genesis of Erik's violent nature but his almost super-human ability to withstand pain), he has developed an unblinkingly tough facade, but as he begins to experience deep friendship and even romantic feelings for the first time, he gets in touch with his caring side as well. Erik is a boy of few words, giving Wilson relatively few lines of dialog and requiring him to evoke a great deal solely through facial expression and bodily aspect. Nonetheless, through Wilson we come to believe in Erik's gradual transformation -- his ultimate transcendance of his brutal homelife and the mistreatment at school. It is also worth noting that other characters are multi-dimensional as well. Not all of the teachers are blind and unfeeling to what is going on with the students, and Erik's worst tormenters show they are vulnerable in surprising ways. Even Erik's timid best friend/roommate proves to have an unexpectedly courageous side. A lesser film would not have strived for such nuance.

The resolution of the story is very satisfying, in part because when Erik finally does fight again (both at school and at home) it is out of considered necessity and not violent impulse. And, when he comes to achieve his ultimate victory at the very end, it is through perseverance, insight, and cleverness rather than violence at all.

The special features on the DVD include a featurette on the making of the movie, where we get to meet Guillou himself and learn more about how he came to write the original novel. We also hear from each of the featured actors and actresses and take in some behind-the-scenes production footage.

I should note that the blurb on the DVD cover (""It's Fight Club in a boarding school"") is way off the mark. Did that critic see the same movie? Hopefully my synopsis gives a better sense of what the film is about.",1152057600,37,4353,4.948016415868673
2388968,4,B000AIQWDQ,"The frequent beatings and emotional abuse that Erik Ponti (Andreas Wilson) experiences at home seeps out in the from of rage and rebellious attitude.  Erik brings this rage to school where he severally physically assaults a student during recess.  The consequences of the assaults expel Erik from from school and his mom decides to send Erik to a reputable boarding school, Stjrnsberg.  Stjrnsberg is Erik's last chance to steer his life in the right direction as there is no other school that would accept him.  Once at Stjrnsberg Erik learns that the students are kept in line by the older students who exercise their malicious bullying as a tool to educate the younger students in proper manners.  This form of abuse is tolerated and accepted by Stjrnsberg's administration as it is the foundation upon which order is enforced in the school.  The defiant Erik finds himself in trouble as he does not know how to approach the evil mistreatment, which he resents, as he only knows the way of the fist.  Fortunately through the well-read Pierre, Erik's roommate and only true friend, Erik discovers the power of the mind, which he uses as he begins to confront the oppression from old traditions of Stjrnsberg.

Evil is based on a autobiographical book written by the author Jan Guillou, who is also known for the literary adventures of Carl Hamilton, a special forces officer.  Jan Guillou is known in Sweden for his books and as an opinion maker as he approaches strong political issues in media and society.  Evil deals with some of these political issues as it displays some of the boarding school's ideologies, which stems from Nazism.  In essence, Evil is a strong political story that is told in the light of one teenager's tragic upbringing that deals with issues in a micro society, Stjrnsberg.  Hfstrm's cinematic visualization of Guillou's book, Evil, offers a tremendous cinematic experience, which was nominated for Best Foreign Film in 2004.",1138752000,3,1955,4.96319018404908
2388969,5,B000AIQWDQ,"A true story, set only 15 years after WWII, this is a stunning and shocking film about a young man who, after frequent physical abuse from his stepfather, becomes the schoolyard bully.  When he is expelled, he is sent by his mother to a tough Private school, which turns out to be tougher than anyone could possible expect.  Some of the teachers are still Nazi's, and the teachers ignore the ritual violence that the school seniors impose on the younger students.  This is Eric's last chance in the school system, and has to fight to his core not to react to the violence, but because of the years of abuse he has sustained, he is able to switch off to it.  When the bully's recognise this, they becomes more and more extreme, eventually striking out at those he loves in an effort to get to him. The film is very well directed and all the performances are excellent.

I haven't this particular edition, but the basic extras are very interesting, especially the interviews with the writer (who's autobiographical book the film is based on).

And whilst this has nothing to do with the film, Andreas Wilson who plays the lead, is perhaps one of the most beautiful men to grace the screen, and I look forward to seeing more from him.",1135468800,2,1231,4.547511312217194

This is the only film, and the story is from the author's youth.  As the film comes from Sweden, I felt Ingmar Bergman's shadow hanging over it a little bit, and was therefore very glad for the simplicity and directness of the way the story was told.  The story is simple but not less awful for that.  One has to appreciate an author who presents such things this way - things that happen every day, everywhere.  I doubt there is a person on the planet who isn't in touch with someone in the situations shown here.  The acting is excellent and the settings and cinematography are as well.  I'm glad I own it.

Overall the movie is very entertaining and even educational; the bullying issues in the film are sadly still relevant today.

Everyone receives different messages by watching these types of films; I received the message that you should always stick up for yourself, the system sometimes doesn't work, and Evil should always be destroyed. Regardless of whether you're watching this film for it's educational values or its entertainment, it's still a very well made film and deserves more attention.

This gets him kicked out of school and branded as ""evil"". His desperate mother sells paintings and other heirlooms to get him enrolled in a private school, which turns out to be a boarding school from hell. The upperclassmen relentlessly and violently abuse the younger ones while the headmaster and faculty look the other way. Although it's not a part of the movie, the novel's author managed to get the real school closed down through a journalistic expos&eacute; several years after he attended this hellhole.

Now, over 50 years later, such schools no longer exist ... or do they?

The marching band had a long history of hazing abuse... and an equally long history of adults not lifting a finger to stop it.  As the French would say, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

Getting back to this movie only based on real life, the performances are superlative by the ensemble cast, especially Andreas Wilson as Erik and Gustaf Skarsgard (, the brother of True Blood's Alexander Skarsgard), as his sadistic tormentor.

2388983,4,B000AIQWDQ,"I wasn't sure what to make of ""Evil"" as I watched the beginning of the film.  I knew that there was one character I WASN'T going to like and then I sat back and watched as the whole movie focussed on him.  Eventually, I realized the greatness of ""Evil"" was the message that there are many types of bullies in the world and the movie did well to show us a variety of them.  It actually enabled me (and, I suspect, most viewers as well) to compromise my values and root for the ""better"" bully.  Was this, then, a message about ourselves?  Is it that we are fickle in whom we approve of.  Do we cheer some bullies while while condemning other?  Is life just a struggle to gain and maintain the upper hand?  All of this ran through my mind as I was enjoying this movie.  Punk kid, Step-father, upper classmen, School administrator, and, while we're on the subject, how about the lawyer?  Weren't they all bullies?  Do the ends justify the means?

""Evil"" is good (pardon the pun).  You can view it from many angles and it's still a good movie.  My perspective was focussed on not letting go of the young man as we first saw him.  In that regard, I was forced to examine my own perspective of good and evil.",1292630400,,1201,4.275555555555556
2388984,5,B000AIQWDQ,"""Ondskan"" is a dark study of the inner turmoil brought upon an individual subjected to intense social violence. Sure, we've all seen the character done before: the brooding hero who stands alone against the oppression of the majority. But unlike those other movies, ""Ondskan"" takes a deeper look into the Hero. Erik is wonderfully portrayed, and has your emotions churning from the beginning.

Erik is a teenager in a strict household. He has his mother's sympathies, but his father beats him everyday after dinner while his mother looks on in a different room. The actor and actress playing the parents both pull good performances, and the dinner scenes in the family home are full of a tense, electrically foreboding atmosphere. When Erik gets kicked out of school for bullying, he is sent to a boarding school where he faces the injustice of the school system and the vicious upper-classmen. Erik has vowed to himself not to let his mother down and graduate school, but that is conflicting with his morals as he stands up to the seniors.

When he leaves his father's oppression, he thinks he is facing a sort of freedom that will allow him to be who he wants to be, no longer running away and toward his father. Unfortunately, he finds he hasn't escaped violence after all. More than standing up to the students himself, Erik is standing up to a part of his life he will no longer tolerate.

This movie is intense, thrilling, and moving. Don't let the subtitles put you off! This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I haven't yet read the novel, but fully intend to.",1264377600,,1575,4.67870036101083
2388985,4,B000AIQWDQ,"The movie covers very typical ground, that is, a strong quiet type who defends the oppressed.  He comes into town (school) with a mysterious past, and shows great restraint and strength.  He has a weak but likable friend who he must defend (shades of the Illiad!).  Once he can let his anger go, it is justified and therefore satisfying to the audience.  The differences between this movie and its many American counterparts is the level of violence.  In Roadhouse, just to name one example, the main character gets horribly beaten, and horribly beats others as well.  The best friend in that movie dies, in this one just gets expelled.  What really struck me as different was that when the evil upper classmen tie our hero to stakes, they pour hot and cold water on him rather than the typical American movie fair of much rougher stuff.  It may sound that I didn't enjoy the film but I very much did, since well done genre art is very  satisfying.  There was absolutely no surprises in the movie but the cultural differences, the well done acting, and the direction made it well worth my time.  Bravo Sweeden!",1263513600,,1110,4.641025641025641
2388986,4,B000AIQWDQ,"Erik Ponti (Andreas Wilson) is a troubled 16 year old who frequently fights at his Swedish public school in the late 1950s.  He eventually is expelled, and his mother and abusive step-father enroll him in a repressive boarding school, Stj&auml;rnsberg.  At Stj&auml;rnsberg, all the discipline is done by upper level students, not the faculty.  Not surprisingly, he immediately runs afoul of the upperclassmen and is singled out for ""discipline"" (being thumped on the head with a butter knife).  However, he does something no one else has done - he refuses the punishment.  Things quickly spiral out of control as the upperclassmen use ever escalating methods of revenge against Erik.

Many films have explored the dark world of all-boy's schools, including the far superior ""If...""  Ultimately, ""Evil"" really doesn't add anything new to the genre.  However, the film is a compelling look at the kind of bullying that goes on at many schools.  As such, it is sometimes frighteningly graphic in its portrayal of student-on-student violence, despite the cozy 1950s setting.  Erik is initially presented as the one who is ""evil,"" but it quickly becomes apparent that Erik is a victim of his environment and is actually a pretty decent kid.  You'll be cheering for him as he grows over time and fights back in more appropriate ways.  I have no idea whether the film's depiction of a Swedish boarding school is realistic, although it is based on a semi-autobiographical novel ""Ondskan"" that was a huge best-seller in Sweden.  Despite the downbeat subject matter, I enjoyed the film and the main character's developmental arc.

""Evil"" received seven nominations for the Guldbagge Awards (the official Swedish film awards), winning Best Picture, Best Production Design, and Best Cinematography.  Indeed, the film is an exceedingly handsome production that beautifully evokes 1950s Sweden.  Somewhat surprisingly (given the topic matter), ""Evil"" also was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film; it lost to ""The Barbarian Invasions.""  I'd never heard of the film until I saw it on the list of Oscar nominees, but I'm glad I found it.",1259020800,2,2147,5.176811594202898
2388987,3,B000AIQWDQ,"The Bottom Line:

Evil, a manifestly undeserving Oscar Nominee for best foreign film, not only suffers from some lapses in storytelling (in the first scene the main character Erik is shown heartlessly bullying another student, but for the rest of the film he's almost saintly in his goodness with no explanation given whatsoever) but happily plunders just about every non-conformist-in-a-school type film there is, presenting a story that's a shade more brutal than most of its inspirations but much less inspired; it cannot be denied that this is a watchable piece of entertainment, but if you've seen three or four movies before you'll be able to predict the plot of this one 20 minutes in.

2388988,5,B000AIQWDQ,"Were this movie released in ""mainstream"" cinema, it would be designated as a Classic. EVIL has it all! Good direction, excellent cast, and marvelous filming. Andreas Wilson presents a gripping performance as Erik, reminiscent of James Dean's performance in Rebel Without a Cause. A painfully realistic movie replete with pompous administrators more concerned with an outward appearance of propriety while the inmates are running the asylum, a compelling mix of violence and tender moments. Usually movies with with wild special effects require watching more than a few times to see what you missed the first time... this one requires revisiting to pick up the subtle nuances one missed during the first time viewing. Good flick, don't miss it!",1254787200,4,743,5.305084745762712

8078587,5,B000AIQWDQ,"incredible good movie! Eric, himself a victim of physical abuse at home, stands up to the authoritarian rule by older students in a Swedish high school. The way older students rule the school and their cruel punishments illustrates how easily authoritarian and fascists regimes work and how they are supported by bystanders. All is based on fear. And often the people in charge carry the most fear inside.",1526515200,,405,4.970588235294118
