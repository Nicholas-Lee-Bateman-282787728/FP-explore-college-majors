5468205,5,B00AQ5SPBU,lucy fans will adore this box set with all 32 episodes.,1108166400,,55,4.090909090909091
5468206,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"I am happy that CBS and Paramount have released another season of ""I Love Lucy."" I have watched this series in its perpetual repeats my entire life and owning these DVD sets and being able to watch classic ""Lucy"" anytime I want is terrific.

I'm a big fan of ""I Love Lucy"" episodes set in the Ricardo's New York City apartment. Season Three contains 31 really enjoyable episodes of this variety. There are no Hollywood stars or European locales just fun situations involving Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred. Of course, there are still all of our favorite ""Lucy"" antics. She tries to get into Ricky's show (""The French Revue""), she fights with Ethel (""Lucy and Ethel Buy The Same Dress"") and she gets into those outrageous situations only she can get into (""Bonus Bucks"").

This set also includes one of my all-time favorite ""I Love Lucy"" episodes, ""Lucy is Envious."" This is the one where Lucy and Ethel pledge $500 to a charity of Lucy's snotty school friend and in order to raise the money they take a job dressing up as Martian women for a publicity stunt for a movie. The ending scene in this episode is especially funny.

As with Season Two, they have packaged the entire season (31 episodes) into a cardboard sleeve that holds five slim cases containing the five DVD discs. The whole season of classic episodes will take up a spot on your DVD shelf about two inches wide but the entertainment is much more enormous.

The extras are comparable to the Season Two set. You will find original openings and transitions, some deleted scenes used to bridge continuity when shows were rerun, some commercials that Lucy and Desi did to promote their films, etc., there are flubs, and some radio shows of Lucy's ""My Favorite Husband"" series. What is missing is commentaries by either Lucy experts or surviving cast members or crew. I would have found it interesting to have had ""Lucy"" writers Bob Carroll, Jr. and Madelyn Pugh's commentaries included. Commentaries probably would have meant a bigger investment from CBS, so maybe that's why we have none.

For the most part the visual quality of the episodes is outstanding. I have never seen some of these shows look so sharp and clear with rich shades of gray and lots of picture detail. This is the good news. The bad news is there are two episodes, ""Sentimental Anniversary"" and ""Bonus Bucks"" (a favorite of mine), that are of far inferior quality. These two episodes have a muddy look with very little picture definition. When these are played side by side with the pristine episodes they really look bad. I don't know how they slipped these two poor quality transfers onto the DVD set. This is my biggest complaint. I hope CBS doesn't let this happen on any more Lucy sets.",1107993600,15,2721,4.69601677148847
5468207,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"For us 20 something year old's, all we have are our grandparents to remember when I Love Lucy was on the air but this show is not just limited to those with gray hair and bifocals.  All ages can enjoy this hilarious clean comedy.  Parents can definitely be comforted knowing that their kids' minds won't be warped because due to controversial material that are part of sitcoms today.  TV Land only shows I Love Lucy once or twice a day, and I can't remember the last time I actually watched it on TV.  Buying the DVD is highly recommended...you can  never get sick of Lucy and Ethel's antics....all they need to do is put out the last four seasons and us Lucy maniacs are in heaven!",1107388800,5,682,4.380952380952381
5468208,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"Finally, another I Love Lucy season on DVD. Lucy, Ricky, and the Mertzes return with more of their wacky escapedes, ideas, and plots for revenge on their spouses that continue to turn out not exactly as planned.
The packaging for this one is just like the second season, which I thought was nice because it takes up so little space, unlike season one. The 31 Episodes included in season three are:

Ricky's Life Story..................The Girls Go Into Business
The Sublease.......................Equal Rights
Baby Pictures.......................Lucy Tells the Truth
The French Revue................Redec. Mertzes'Apartment
Too Many Crooks.................Changin the Boys' Wardrobe

Bonus Bucks........................Ricky's Hawaiian Vacation
Lucy is Envious....................Lucy Writes a Novel

5468209,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"Over 50 years ago during the early years of broadcast television, the very inspired talents of Lucille Ball (1911-1989) and her then husband Desi Arnaz (1917-1986) were showcased on their hilarious television show ""I Love Lucy"". TV execs had initially rejected the plausibility of the show because of Desi and because they intended to tape the shows. However, thanks to the tireless efforts of Lucille Ball and Desi's obvious talents, the show first aired in 1951 and quickly became one of the most successful TV shows during all six of its regular seasons. As Lucy and Ricky Ricardo on ""I Love Lucy"", Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were joined by William Frawley (1877-1966) and Viviane Vance (1909-1979) as their best-friends/apartment landlords of Fred and Ethel Mertz.

The third season of ""I Love Lucy"" that aired between 1953 and 1954 has 31 memorable episodes:

1. ""Ricky's 'Life' Story"": Not happy about being ignored in Ricky's magazine interview, Lucy gets back at Ricky.

2. ""The Girls Go Into Business"": Lucy & Ethel purchase a dress shop, but things don't turn out as profitably as they had imagined.

3. ""Lucy and Ethel Buy the Same Dress"": Getting a rare opportunity to perform on TV for their women's club, Lucy & Ethel purchase the same dress.

4. ""Equal Rights"": When Lucy & Ethel demand equal rights from Ricky & Fred, the men only think that they are getting back at them at a restaurant.

5. ""Baby Pictures"": Lucy's jealousy over Carolyn Appleby's (Doris Singleton) baby as compared with Little Ricky is not advantageous to Ricky's upcoming appearance on a TV show hosted by Carolyn's husband.

6. ""Lucy Tells the Truth"": Lucy bets Ricky that she can tell the truth for 24 hours and drives everyone crazy.

7. ""The French Revue"": Ricky bets Lucy $50 that she won't be able to sneak into his new French review club act.

8. ""Redecorating the Mertzes' Apartment"": Lucy helps Ethel & Fred redecorate their apartment, including new paint and new upholstery with obvious results.

9. ""Too Many Crooks"": Ricky thinks Lucy is the notorious ""Madame X"" that has been robbing nearby apartments; she's really been collecting objects for a club bazaar.

10. ""Changing the Boys' Wardrobe"": Disgusted by Ricky & Fred's aging wardrobe, Lucy & Ethel sell their husband's old clothes to a second-hand man.

11. ""Lucy Has Her Eyes Examined"": A visit to an eye doctor doesn't help Lucy audition for a jitterbug number that she has practiced for.

12. ""Ricky's Old Girlfriend"": Lucy's worried about Ricky's reaction to a visit in NY by one of his old Cuban girlfriends: Carlotta Romero.

13. ""The Million-Dollar Idea"": Lucy & Ethel's TV commercial to sell Lucy's salad dressing ends up doing much better than expected.

14. ""Ricky Minds the Baby"": Ricky doesn't do as good a job as Lucy of taking care of Little Ricky.

15. ""The Charm School"": Lucy & Ethel go to charm school to keep Ricky & Fred interested in them.

16. ""Sentimental Anniversary"": Lucy & Ricky want to have a quiet wedding anniversary, but Fred & Ethel have other ideas.

17. ""Fan Magazine Interview"": Lucy & Ricky prepare for a fan magazine interview, but a quarrel between them could change the interview outcome.

18. ""Oil Wells"": The Ricardos' new neighbors want them to invest in oil wells.

19. ""Ricky Loses His Temper"": Lucy bets Ricky that he can't keep his temper and that she won't buy any new hats.

20. ""Home Movies"": When Ricky gets the opportunity to do a film audition, Lucy, Ethel & Fred create their own film that Lucy edits with Ricky's home movies of Little Ricky.

21. ""Bonus Bucks"": Lucy & Ethel become obsessed with trying to win money with 'bonus bucks'.

22. ""Ricky's Hawaiian Vacation"": Lucy & Ethel go on a game show to try and win a trip to Hawaii to be with Ricky.

23. ""Lucy Is Envious"": Lucy is too ashamed to admit that she can't afford a $500 donation to a rich friend's charity.

24. ""Lucy Writes a Novel"": Lucy decides to write a novel, but doesn't like the response that she gets from an interested publisher.

25. ""Lucy's Club Dance"": When Lucy & Ethel's 'all-girl' orchestra rehearse horribly for a club dance, Ricky has to think fast since Lucy put his name as their orchestra leader.

26. ""The Black Wig"": To test Ricky's fidelity, Lucy dons a black wig to tempt him; but Fred knows all about the scheme.

27. ""The Diner"": When Ricky decides to quit show business, he & Fred purchase a diner; but everyone isn't too happy with their new duties.

28. ""Tennessee Ernie Visits"": When Cousin Ernie (Tennessee Ernie Ford, 1919-1991) pays the Ricardos an unexpected visit, Lucy tries to scare him away.

29. ""Tennessee Ernie Hangs On"": Still staying with the Ricardos, Lucy once again tries to get him to leave by pretending that she & Ricky are impoverished.

30. ""The Golf Game"": Wanting to spend more time with Ricky & Fred, Lucy & Ethel get the men to teach them how to play golf; but it isn't how most people play the game.

31. ""The Sublease"": Planning to be gone for a while, Lucy & Ricky sublet their apartment; but Lucy (per usual) changes her mind and wants to get their apartment back from the timid Mr. Beecher (Jay Novello, 1904-1982).

Paramount Home Video's superb job of packaging all 32 episodes of the second season of ""I Love Lucy"" onto 5 DVD's is a good indication as to how they will similarly package the third season.  Overall, for superb packaging and a great price, I rate the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Third Season"" DVD box set with an anticipatory 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it!",1104278400,199,5516,4.7174139728884255
5468210,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"This is a fine collection, but Amazon's site doesn't list the contents (John Wayne, Loving Cup, Tennessee Bound, Paris Gown, Golf Game) so you may not be aware that I Love Lucy Collection 2 contains this video *and* Best of I Love Lucy Volume 4, as well as a bonus Babalu Music video.  It's confusing to see ""Customers who bought this video also bought:...I Love Lucy Collection 2"" when what you'd be doing is purchasing duplicates.

plastic case. I like It because It's easier to keep them from
scratching over this style that has all the discs In a folder style.
The older one's did have a downside. The exterior case was

I have season's 1-4 and all of them have slipcovers except for this one. It may not be such a big deal but I paid for it and I should have gotten the slip cover too. I was going to send it back but I bought the product at a lower price and by the time I had received it the price had jumped back up and Amazon's policy states that you must pay the difference if the price increases if you exchange the item. Other than that the contents of the DVDs themselves are incredible. Each episode has been remastered and looks really great on an HD television for 1950s black and white film.

But when Lucy and Ethel run into golf pro Jimmy Demaret and he explains the actual rules, they decide to get even!

THE SUBLEASE: When Ricky gets a gig in Maine, the Ricardos plan to sublet their apartment at a profit.  Landlords Fred and Ethel nix the deal unless the Ricardos split the profit with them.  The sublease is signed, but Ricky's booking gets cancelled, and now the Ricardos have to move in with the Mertzes!",1334448000,3,10100,4.7124928693668

Season 3-4 are definitely my favorite seasons to watch, and the picture quality of the dvds are absolutely remarkable. It is 10X better than watching I love Lucy on regular tv and you can definitely tell the difference when I love Lucy comes on cable tv. I have wondered if they will actually start making these sets in color and it is a big possibility for the future.

5468497,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"In season two Lucy had little Ricky.  Most of the season dealt with the pregnancy and the joys of a newborn.  In season three Little Ricky is now a toddler.  The 31 episodes are on five discs.

Disc One:

Ricky's ""LIFE"" Story - A pictorial spread on Ricky appears in LIFE magazine but Lucy is nowhere to be scene (well her elbow can be scene).  Lucy blames Ricky for this.  Fred comes up with a scheme to quite Lucy forever.  Ricky gives Lucy a starring role in a dance number.  The plan is to make it so strenuous that Lucy will quit.  It works until Fred blurts out the plan to Lucy.  This creates a great revenge scene.

The Girls Go Into Business - Lucy and Ethel's favorite dress shop is up for sale and the girls decide to buy it.  What they find out is it appears that they are the shop's only customers.

Lucy and Ethel buy the Same Dress - When the girls Ladies' Club is given 30 minutes on television for a show, Lucy promises the club Ricky so she can take control of the show.  Lucy and Ethel decide to perform Cole Porter's Friendship for the finale.  But when they show up in the same dress, the number goes from friendship to fiendship!

Equal Rights - Lucy demands that Ricky and Fred treat Ethel and her as equals.  The catch is Ricky and Fred decide to enforce this at dinner and have the maitre d' give the girls separate checks.  When they can't pay, they are forced to clean dishes. The girls play a phone prank to get the boys back to the restaurant but the boys find out and turn the tables on the girls but have the girls get the last laugh.

Baby Pictures - Lucy and Ricky make a vow not to bore everyone with pictures of Little Ricky.  But when Caroline and Charlie Appleby start showing pictures of their son, Stevie, and putting down Little Ricky, Lucy pulls the gloves off and almost costs Ricky a job on Charlie's show.

Lucy Tells the Truth - This is one of the classic shows.  Lucy bets the others that she can tell the absolute truth for 24 hours but forgets that she has a bridge game with the girls the next afternoon.  Ethel prods Lucy but to everyone's amazement and disdain, Lucy tells them exactly what she is thinking.

The French Revue - The gang goes to a posh French restaurant but cannot read the menu.  Lucy and Ethel get the waiter to give them lessons.  That is if he gets an audition with Ricky.  After resisting it, Ricky decides to do a French Revue but tells Lucy to stay out of it.  But Lucy bets Ricky that she will get in the show!

Disc Two:

Redecorating the Mertz's Apartment - Ricky is going to buy Lucy a mink stole. Lucy wants to wear it to the Lady's Club meeting but Ethel doesn't want to have the meeting at her apartment because it is shabby.  Lucy decides that all it needs is a coat of paint and the furniture reupholstered.  All goes well until the feather chair!

Too Many Crooks - There is a cat burglar working the area and the police think that it is a woman.  When Mrs. Trumball sees Lucy taking one of Fred's suits from Ethel's apartment, Ethel thinks that Lucy is the crook.  Ethel decides to stake out Lucy but when she gets cold, Fred gives her his coat and hat.  Lucy sees Ethel on the fire escape and assumes that Ethel is Madame X.

Changing the Boys' Wardrobe - When the boys insist on wearing ""comfortable"" clothes to the movies, the girls decide to sell the guys old clothes.  But the store owner makes his living from selling the old clothes back to the husbands.  So when Ricky invites Lucy and Ethel to have dinner at the club, the girls decide to get even by showing up in the boys old clothes.  What they didn't know is Ricky was receiving an award and photographers are at the club.

Lucy Has Her Eyes Examined - An old friend of Ricky's is casting a new musical.  When Ricky invites him for dinner, the gang decides to audition.  Fred and Ethel are asked to perform a Charleston and Lucy a jitterbug.  Lucy hires a partner who is a gas / way gone....(He is hilarious).  The substory is Ricky is having headaches and Lucy takes him to the optometrist but it turns out she needs to have her eyes tested.  Unfortunately, her eyes are dilated  and she can't see her dance partner.

Ricky's Old Girlfriend - Lucy becomes obsessed with an old flame of Ricky.  And when Carlotta makes an appearance at a New York nightclub, Lucy thinks the worst (with one of her great over the top dream sequences.)  To resolve this Ricky invites Carlota over and she doesn't turn out to be what either Ricky remembers or Lucy expects.

The Million Dollar Idea - When Fred tells Lucy that her salad dressing is great, Lucy and Ethel decide to go into business selling it.  To advertise it they use Charlie Appleby's TV station - this is of course is one of the classic scenes.  But when Ricky finds out, he figures out what is costing to make and the girls are losing money.  The problem is Fred arrives with three bags of orders.  Lucy comes up with the idea to do another commercial saying the salad dressing is bad but this only generates more orders!

Disc Three:

Ricky Minds the Baby - Ricky has the week off and offers to mind Little Ricky while he is at home.  Lucy has separation pains and when Little Ricky toddles off, Lucy decides to teach the boys a lesson.

The Charm School - When the boys pay too much attention to a beautiful woman, the girls decide to attend charm school to improve their allure. (Note: the head of the charm school is played by Natalie Schaeffer better known as Mrs. Thurston Howell III).  But when they unveil their new models, the boys are less than complimentary.

Sentimental Anniversary - Ricky gets his anniversary off but Lucy wants a quite dinner at home.  But Ethel and Fred are planning a surprise party.

Fan Magazine Interview - Ricky and Lucy become the subject of a magazine photo essay.

Oil Wells - The new tenants, Mr. & Mrs. Johnson are oil investors and the gang buy the final shares for the field.  After the initial giddiness from the expected wealth, they begin to ask the question, is this a scam?

Ricky Loses His Temper -  Lucy bets Ricky that she can go longer not buying a hat than he can hold his temper.  The problem is that the hat shop is having a sale and she cannot resist.  Therefore, she must get Ricky to lose his temper before the shop delivers the new hat.

DISC FOUR:

Home Movies - Everyone, including Lucy, is sick of Ricky's home movies. But when Ricky makes one for a TV special and he excludes the gang, Lucy creates one of her own. The end result is truly unique!

Bonus Bucks - The local newspaper has a contest where if you have a dollar bill with the winning serial number you win up to $300.  When Ricky finds one, he puts it in Lucy's purse so she will think she found it.  But Lucy gives it to the grocery boy, who gives it to Ethel.  This starts a feud on who owns it that ends at the laundry.

Ricky's Hawaiian Vacation - Ricky gets an offer to bring the show to Honolulu but can't bring the gang.  So Lucy comes up with a plan to win the trip on a radio show and gets herself in a sticky mess.

Lucy is Envious - A successfully married school chum is in town and is raising funds for one of her charities.  Lucy cannot let her know her financial circumstances and accidentally pledges $500.  When  Ethel also pledges the same, the girls get a job doing a publicity stunt to raise the money.

Lucy Writes a Novel - The title describes the episode.  But this is a hack novel about the gang.  Lucy gets an offer to publish it by accident.

Lucy's Club Dance - The club is broke and decides to have a dance.  But they can't afford a band, so they start one with the members.  In a great scene, Lucy gets Ricky to help out.  But even Ricky can't help this group.  This episodes end in a variation of Some Like it Hot.

DISC FIVE:

The Black Wig - Ricky won't let Lucy cut her hair, so when she has her hair cut she tries on a brunette wig.  Then gets the idea to test Ricky but he gets tipped off and decides to ""take her for a ride.""

The Diner - This is another get rich scheme which involves the whole gang this time.  The gang buys a diner.  But when Fred and Ethel get tired of being behind the counter and quit, Ricky and Lucy cannot fend for themselves.

Tennessee Ernie Visits - The middle son of one of Lucy's mother's friends is coming to NYC and the Ricardo's are asked to host him.  The difference between city life and country life becomes evident.  Singer / celebrity Tennessee Ernie Ford makes his first of three appearances.

Tennessee Ernie Hangs On - Lucy devises a plan to get rid of Cousin Ernie by pretending to be broke.  It worked at first but Ernie decides he can't leave until they are back on their feet.  It ends with an appearance on Milikin's Chicken-Mash Hour with Ernie Ford and His Four Hot Chicken Pickers.

The Golf Game - Since Lucy gave Ricky the golf clubs for their anniversary, the boys spend all their time talking or practicing.  So Lucy decides if she can't beat them join them.  But the guys don't like that idea and decide to make the game so difficult the girls will quit.  But Lucy gets her revenge in spades. Special Guest Appearance by then three time Masters Champion Jimmy Demaret

The Sublease - Ricky's band gets an out of town booking and they decide to sublease the apartment.  This causes a rift between the couples but of course it is resolved.  But worse things happen the gig gets cancelled and now Lucy has to figure how to get the new tenant out.

The interesting thing with larger TV's and digital images is that background scenery that looked fine on old sets now really looks fake (See The Golf Game).  But for shows like this it adds a bit of nostalgic charm.

The musical numbers performed by Desi Arnaz also add to the joy of this sitcom, with beautiful songs in this season like ""Lady of Spain"" and ""Vaya con Dios.""

  Providing much of the laughs in this season is Fred Mertz, with his unforgettable line in ""Lucy has her eyes examined."" In this episode, one of the series most memorable characters, the hip ""King Kat Walsch"" sees Fred in a Russian fur costume and says ""Man, that's the coolest.""

5468512,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethel are back with their third season.  Little has changed in these 31 episodes (unlike future years when they start traveling).  Still, the writers and actors come up with some of their best stuff to date in this five-disc set.

There are many episodes considered to be classics in this season.  ""Lucy and Ethel Buy the Same Dress"" and almost ruin their friendship on TV over it.  ""Lucy Tells the Truth"" and gets knives thrown at her for her efforts.  In an effort to regain their husbands' attention, Lucy and Ethel attend ""Charm School"" with different results from what they expected.  A ""Bonus Buck"" turns out to be a starchy deal.  Lucy and Ethel learn ""The Golf Game"" in a way you've never seen before.  This season also features two of Tennessee Ernie Ford's three appearances on the show.

There are many equally funny episodes in this set that I love that aren't on any classic list I've ever seen.  ""Equal Rights"" finds the girls washing dishes to settle a tab when the boys let them pay their own way.  ""Baby Pictures"" contains one of my all time favorite lines from the show when we learn Little Ricky speaks English and Spanish, but he only speaks Spanish when he's angry.  ""Sentimental Anniversary"" is funny and sweet at the same time.  ""Ricky Loses His Temper"" nominates Ricky for sainthood with what Lucy puts him through.  Finally, ""Ricky's Hawaiian Vacation"" finds Lucy trying to sneak her way with the band by lying to a game show.

Once again, this set is ideal for collectors.  The 31 episodes are presented in all their black and white glory.  I doubt they could look better.  The sound, while not earth shattering, is true to the program and it certainly sounds sharp.  Each disc is loaded with info on guest stars, behind the scenes information, flubs, original animation, and the other goodies we're used to seeing from these releases.

You can't go wrong with the first foursome of comedy.  This is a classic show for a reason.  If you even like Lucy, you'll be glad you got this set.",1121212800,9,2034,4.635854341736695
5468513,4,B00AQ5SPBU,"Just wanted to say that on Disc 5 in the Special Footage section there was a minor flaw in the Christmas Tag scene with Ricky and Lucy; Lucy's first few words are temporarily muted in the beginning of her dialogue; If one keeps rewinding several times in the hopes of hearing the full sentence, there is a possibility to overcome the problem. My DVD player plays perfectly and if anyone noticed this imperfection, please post your impressions as soon as possible. I LOVE LUCY!",1121126400,2,476,4.678571428571429
5468514,4,B00AQ5SPBU,"This DVD collection makes me laugh out loud although it only really contains one famous Lucy episode(the one when she is a knive throwers assitant). It contains the hillarous visit from Tenesse Ernie.

While the second featured more song numbers by Desi this one shines more on Lucy and her inability to sing. Still you see those classic facial expressions and hair that launched her to superstardom. Desi Arnaz still to me seems to be the unsung star of the show- with his comedic ability surpassing Vivian Vance and William Frawley. I felt kind of sad though because unlike in Season One & Season Two you don't see many tender moments between Desi and Lucy except for their very sweet and endearing ""Sentimental Anniversary.""

Still despite that I get laughs from the pro-golf player's guest spot on the show and Tennesse Ernie. It's easy to see why this show became so timeless quickly. Lucy and Desi have created a dynasty and are bound to live on forever. All in all this DVD set makes up for it's pricetag- your getting hours of laughs, gags, and pranks! Be sure to buy this Season and you'll love Lucy too!",1114214400,3,1113,4.644670050761421
5468515,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"Widely considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, show in television history, I Love Lucy signaled the ascendance of the prime time TV era. The brainchild of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, I Love Lucy revolutionized the television industry with its extensive use of a live audience and the employment of multiple camera angles. The result of true comic genius, the show's ability to entertain is just as relevant today as it was fifty years ago...

Real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play the prominent roles of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, a married couple living in a New York apartment complex. Ricky is a Cuban-born band leader who wows night clubs with his act, while Lucy is a homemaker. Lucy and Ricky's best friends are landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz who often become intertwined in Lucy's get-rich-quick schemes, screwball ideas, and comic shenanigans. Former masters of the stage, the cast comes across as a likeable bunch, with Lucille Ball stealing the show with her goofy antics and brilliant facial contortions. If ever there were a television classic, then I Love Lucy is it...

The I Love Lucy (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""The Girls Go Into Business"" in which Lucy and Ethel buy a dress shop, and then struggle with all things business-related including what to name the store. When they fail to sell a single dress, they're forced to sell off the shop... Other notable episodes include ""Equal Rights"" in which Lucy and Ethel demand equal rights (which prompts Fred and Ricky to ask for four separate checks for their dinner). When the girls can't pay, they must wash dishes. And ""Oil Wells"" in which the Ricardo's and the Mertz's get a hot stock tip from their new Texas neighbors, prompting them to investigate as to whether the new couple is a pair of swindlers...

Below is a list of episodes included on the I Love Lucy (Season 3) DVD:

Episode 68 (The Girls Go Into Business)

5468516,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"I'm finally ready to give an ""I Love Lucy"" collection a full ***** review.  ""I Love Lucy Season III"" is certainly worthy of it, and so is this stellar presentation, that like Season II, is stuffed full of special features and presented in economical packaging that will allow even those on the tightest of budgets to experience what has to be the greatest sitcom in television history.

Season III is full of classic episodes, and also some very good episodes that have never before been available on home video.  Forgotten episodes like ""Ricky's Hawaiian Vacation"", which features the hilarious number ""King Kamehameha (sp?)"" and the uproarious scene where Lucy impersonates Ethel and Fred's mother in order to win a trip to Hawaii are presented along with classic rib ticklers like ""Bonus Bucks"", in which Lucy ends up in a laundry's starch vat, and the gut-busting ""Lucy Has Her Eyes Examined"", which finds Lucy trying to jitterbug while literally rendered blind by eyedrops.  In all, there is only one clinker in the entire collection, and its still better than 90% of today's sitcom episodes:  ""Lucy is Envious"", which finds Lucy and Ethel impersonating Martians on the Empire State Building.

As far as the extras are concerned, I can't get enough of the goofs and flubs, which include legendary ones like Lucy misreading the line ""Paint the furniture and reupholster the old furniture"" and not-so-obvious ones like a moth flying past Vivian Vance's head, which doesn't even merit a reaction from the old pro.  And there is the very welcome ""Guest Stars"" list, so the many guest stars who have remained uncredited for so many years can finally get there due.

In all, it only took one more year for an excellent sitcom to reach its creative peak and become television legend--and that season is due out in about a month.  Of course, I'm talking about the brilliant Season 4, which starts with the topnotch ""Business Manager"" episode featuring the still-living, 100-year-old Charles Lane as the miser-from-hell, continues with my all-time favorite episode ""Ethel's Birthday"", in which Ethel and Lucy war over Lucy's unfortunate choice of birthday present for her pal, all the way to the legendary Hollywood story arc, which spills over into Season 5.

In all, CBS Video continues to make amends for its horrible botch of the Season One collection with another stellar, affordable package that will satisfy Lucy fans everywhere, and may even convince those who still may not understand what all the fuss is about, especially if all they have seen are the bowdlerized TV versions.  These beautifully restored, complete episodes belong in every home in America.  ***** (out of *****)",1113004800,,2685,5.0225225225225225
5468517,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"Hi, I am from Europe and have been looking for years, to get hold of these series! Have seen the first two series and have seen the first DVD of season 3 and loved every episode. Happy to hear that serie 4 is on its way!

Eventhough the European audience loved Lucy very much throughout the years, it is sad that we cannot buy them in the European stores!!!! Thank's to the internet we can get them now!!!!",1112486400,2,406,4.205128205128205
5468518,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"""I Love Lucy: The Complete Third Season"" is a fun-filled box set of all the hilarious episodes of the groundbreaking series' third season.

With an established formula by the time the season kicked off, writers Jess Oppenheimer, Bob Carroll Jr. and Madeline Pugh forged ahead with what they knew worked well. Referencing many scripts they wrote for Lucille Ball's radio show ""My Favorite Husband,"" they consistently churned out instant classics, making the third season the most impressive thus far.

Due to many of its episodes featuring the fame of Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz) significantly ballooning, we of course find an abundance of Lucy's hair-brained schemes to get into the act at his nightclub, the Tropicana. With her trying to sneak into the club numerous times to win a bet with Ricky that she cannot invade unnoticed, Lucy eventually infiltrates the line of can-can dancers in ""The French Revue"" after sneaking in disguised as an elderly woman. Her upstaging of Ricky in her role as the Lady of Spain in ""Rickie's `Life' Story"" to get even with him after he purposely works her senseless during rehearsals is another memorable gem.

As educated viewers are well aware, one of the best facets of the series was the hilarious series of battles between the spouses and sexes with the Ricardos' stalwart friends and landlords, Fred and Ethel Mertz (William Frawley and Vivian Vance). Indeed, when Lucy wants to help the Mertzes reach a compromise with the dcor of their apartment, things get quite sticky in ""Redecorating the Mertzes' Apartment.""

Moreso, madness ensues in ""Bonus Bucks"" when Lucy accidentally uses a dollar bill with a lottery-qualified serial number to pay the grocery boy who in turns gives it to Ethel, its eventual destination being the laundromat where a helpless Lucy gets trapped on a conveyor belt.

Furthermore, ""The Diner,"" where the Ricardos and Mertzes try in vain to co-run a restaurant, is fit to induce unadulterated belly laughs when both couples try to persuade a drunk to buy a hamburger from either half of their business, now split in two. The price eventually goes down to one penny on the Mertzes' side, prompting Lucy to loan the drunk a dollar to buy one hundred hamburgers from her rivals.

While more classic episodes are included such as ""The Million Dollar Idea,"" where Lucy and Ethel realize they will need to unsell a mammoth amount of salad dressing they sold on television, or ""Too Many Crooks"" where each think the other is notorious neighborhood crook Madame X, the true highlight comes on the fifth disc with the two-part guest appearance of Tennessee Ernie Ford. Playing Cousin Ernie, a nave country bumpkin too innocent to realize he is a burden on the Ricardos after taking permanent residence with them thanks to Lucy's mother, the scene where Lucy dons the disguise of a ""wicked city woman"" and tries to scare him away via ""vamping"" him- and the reaction she has when she realizes he likes the idea - is pure comedic genius.

With all 31 episodes fully intact with digital restoration, each disc contains bloopers, lost scenes, commentaries, featurettes, production notes and 5 complete episodes of Ball's radio program ""My Favorite Husband,"" from which the concept of ""I Love Lucy"" derived. The box set is truly jam-packed and essential to any true fan of the series or pedestrian viewer who could use a good pick-me-up at the end of the day.

""I Love Lucy: The Complete Third Season"" retails for $54.99, but its price greatly varies depending upon retailer.",1108857600,2,3526,4.9543147208121825
5468519,5,B00AQ5SPBU,"From the 31 episodes, there are some that stand out as funny that people may bypass. I am going to give one that stands out on each disc. Starting on Disc One: ""Equal Rights""- After being interrupted by Lucy while telling a story, Ricky  tells her to butt out. She and Ethel demand to have equal rights. After a quick conference, the boys agree to treat them exactly like men. After a dinner that takes several surprisng turns, Lucy and Ethel end up washing dishes. They devise a plan to get back at the boys, it backfires and to see what happens...

  Disc 2: Lucy has her eyes examined

  Now, this is funny, but the amazing part is that Lucy dances extremely well. It is a rare time that the writers allowed Lucy to dance without totally messing things up. Of course the night of the big show- Lucy's eyes are dialated and the show is ""Lucy-esque"".

  Disc 3: All of these are worth it

  Ricky minds the Baby: The three minutes that Ricky acts out Little Red Riding Hood in Spanish for Little Ricky is pure comedy humor!

  The Charm School : Ethel and Lucy decide to enroll in charm school, and out of 100 points, they score in the low thirties. After weeks, Lucy surprised Ricky by entering the room in a very un-Lucy dress and says, ""May I hove a light , please? Thank you awfully, dahling"". And wait until ETHEl enters the room!

  Sentimental Anniversery: I think that Lucille and Desi appear more than once in this episode. A big plus is that you can see them looking throught Desi and Lucille's REAL scrapbooks. And wait until the picture of Ethel and Fred!!

  Disc 4: Again, all of these are classic

  Home Movies: Ricky outraged when, after showing his movie of Little Ricky for the millionth time, Lucy falls asleep and the Mertz's sneak out, refuses to let them be in a movie he is going to show to the producer. So naturally they make their own! And when Lucy splices it together- Watch Out!

  Ricky's Hawiaan Vacation: When Ricky refuses to let Lucy, Ethel and Fred go on a trip with them, they devise a plan to get ohn ""be a good neighbor"". Lucy writed to Freddy Filmore teling him about a poor couple and their grandmother (which is Lucy) who have always wanted to go on a trip. Then Freddy wants to meet this kindly couple. Uh-oh. And when Ms. McGillicuddy goes to the show to win the trip- Freddy says someone has come to help them. Uhoh! It's Ricky. As Lucy says, ""Are you sure he's here to help?""

  Disc 5:  The Black Wig

  Who is that sexy Italian woman? It's Lucy testing Ricky's fidelity. Tipped off by the barber Ricky plays along, much to Lucy's outrage.  And when Ethel tries the same disguise on Fred- the results are hilarious!

  Tenessee Ernie: Luycy dresses as a ""wicked city women"" to scare their country cuzzin away and later Ernie leads them ina rousing, ""Ya'll Come"" as Ernie Ford and his four hot Chickin Pickers.",1108857600,3,2857,4.421153846153846
