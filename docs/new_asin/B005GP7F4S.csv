4692925,5,B005GP7F4S,"I was hooked on this guy ever since I saw him do his impression of Grand Theft Auto. I like very few standup comics because I think they all blend together for the most part. Pablo, however, is a shining beacon of originality. I never miss him when he comes to town (i've seen some of the material off this dvd in his live act and it's great). I highly recommend everyone check him out.",1319414400,2,386,4.16
4692926,5,B005GP7F4S,I was at the taping and Pablo had me rolling on the floor. I will never be able to look at a smart car without laughing hysterically ever again!,1319414400,,144,4.0
4692927,5,B005GP7F4S,I have seen Pablo live many times and have OUCH! and Live From Orange County.  I attended the special taping and this is the best Pablo has been in his career!  I pre-ordered and can't wait for this new Pablo to hit my mailbox!,1319414400,,227,4.136363636363637
4692928,5,B005GP7F4S,"This is going to be a fantastic DVD! I have seen him a few times live (including this new material) and this man is pure Genius! I recently took 6 diverse friends to see him, and he converted 4 new fans that night! Buy this and go see him live. Ashley, the comedian he travels with, is hilarious as well, it's a damn good time!!

4692929,5,B005GP7F4S,I think this dvd is so funny I couldn't stop laughing. I would so watch it again and again. Now I gotta get other pablo comedy dvd.,1378166400,,131,3.888888888888889
4692930,5,B005GP7F4S,"Once again, Pablo Francisco brings us another addition to his already hilarious stand-up specials.  This one definitely did not disappoint. And boom goes the dynamite.",1373328000,,167,5.68
4692931,5,B005GP7F4S,"Well what can I say, if you buy movies from the store, well that's how it looks like, but as far as his comedy standup went.... It wasn't his best one. I think bits and pieces was way better and his best yet, but i still am glad I got his collection going on. It's cheap and I like cheap",1369267200,,287,3.8
4692932,5,B005GP7F4S,Pablo Fransisco is my boyfriends favorite and this DVD stood up to the rest! Super funny and a great deal!,1365552000,,106,4.35
4692933,5,B005GP7F4S,"Funny DVD, my Dad loves it.
I first head of Pablo on the ""Latino Kings of Comedy, Vol. 01"" DVD.",1362096000,,95,3.8
4692934,5,B005GP7F4S,"Pablo Francisco has a unique high-energy style. His incredible talent is showcased thoroughly in this DVD.

He is an accomplished natural actor, able to immediately switch characters without missing a beat.

He has incredible vocal ability to imitate stereotypes: dumb chicks, dumber dudes, hillbillies, conservative pricks, blacks, latinos, midgets, parents, friends, tough-guys, wimps, horny guys, hornier girls, stuck-up girls, stuck up strippers, rock-star worshippers... all funny and frighteningly familiar.

He seems to have a lot of experience with bartenders, bouncers and strippers.

He also does a number of great impersonations: Arnold Schwarzenegger, DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino to name a few. Pablo's vocal sound effects are integral to his style and other than legendary Mel Blanc, I have heard no one more versatile.

This particular DVD shows Pablo at the peak of his powers. The show is slick, fast-paced unrelenting comedy. You need to watch it at least twice just to hear jokes you'll miss from laughing so hard.

In fact, the only criticism I could make of this is that he is so fast, so good and so talented, it might be hard for people to get it if they are not already familiar with his style. If you ARE familiar with Pablo, then get this! If you are not yet familiar with this amazing talent, then check him out on YouTube until you understand what he does. THEN buy the DVD.

He has a number of guest artists who help him at the climax... which by itself is worth the price.

I buy comedy and musical artist's work just to support them, even though I can see some of their work for free.
Pablo Francisco is one artist who truly deserves the title ""artist"" and I will definitely buy more of his stuff.

This particular work is the tour-de-force showcase of his vast talent. It is worth it to see him in his full glory without pop-ups and annoying ads. It is worth it to see him in HD on the big TV. The sound quality and camera work really helps you appreciate his immense talent. This is going to stay in my permanent collection!",1356825600,,2064,4.743016759776537
4692935,4,B005GP7F4S,This comedy specaial was very funny pablo fransico needs his on comedy show on tv every week. I would recommend this to real comedy lovers out there.,1352851200,,149,4.555555555555555
4692936,5,B005GP7F4S,This video was a very funny video and even though i have seen it many times it still makes me laugh. Pablo is a funny guy and this video will have you saying the same. If you have not seen Pablo in any of his videos I recommend this one. CHECK IT OUT!!!,1346803200,,253,3.792452830188679
4692937,5,B005GP7F4S,"Pablo Francisco is an awesome comedian with a dick personality. I love the dude (no homo).
This DVD is hilarious! It's the most recent to date. It's probably not the best DVD but its still pretty funny. I got this DVD with in 4 days so that being said I had no problems. Excellent service.",1327276800,,289,4.2727272727272725
4692938,4,B005GP7F4S,I'm a huge Pablo Francisco fan so when I found out he had a new standup DVD I had to check it out. I have to admit it is not his best stuff but its not as bad as some people on here are making it sound. His Ouch dvd to me is his best DVD to date but if you are a Pablo fan than I think you will enjoy this DVD as well.,1326844800,,318,3.2533333333333334
4692949,5,B005GP7F4S,"To one's who rated 1 star is a true hater, go get a life. If you can't laugh to this, then you must be a ugly miserable creature driving a smartcar..lol. This Stand up is funny. Pablo got me rolling. This DVD is worth buying and watching, if you have a sense a humor and love comedy, you'll enjoy this one. also so what if he twistes or changes up on his old joke he's still funny. ""smart car economical, tiny....LOL""",1326067200,,417,4.160493827160494
4692950,5,B005GP7F4S,Pablo Fancisco is my favorite comedian and once again.. He did not disappoint!! This Pablo video is a must have an contains an abundance of laughter as always!!,1325635200,,160,4.75
4692951,5,B005GP7F4S,"Well Pablo seems to never let you down. Good video full of good jokes. Some old ones, but worth watching to the end where the really nasty jokes are ;)",1325030400,,151,4.066666666666666
4692952,3,B005GP7F4S,"Rule #1 for a stand-up routine: Don't say the title of your stand-up set during your performance.
Rule #2 for a stand-up routine: Don't say the title of your stand-up set during your performance more than 5 times.
Pablo broke rules 1 & 2, and in doing so, made the entire performance feel forced, awkward, and cheesy.  Yes, there were funny parts and if you're a fan of Pablo Francisco, you'll like this stand-up.  He stayed in his comfort zone with the standard impersonations, and Latino humor, but when he did branch out to new comical aspects, it was quickly ruined when Pablo responds to audience shock by quipping, ""I wouldn't make fun of it if they didn't put it out there!""  We get it Pablo: you're doing what everyone else does by observing something and making fun of it.  It was observed because ""it's out there.""  No need to spell it out for everyone.  You're better than this, Pablo!  Please bring it strong next time.",1324684800,,931,4.572289156626506
4692953,3,B005GP7F4S,"Pablo Francisco is a good comedian.  However, this DVD is a bit generic in the content until the very end when he brings in his impression work.  The payoff was too late after a majority of old and possibly unoriginal material.  He should really stick to impressions as it's why I bought the DVD in the 1st place.",1324166400,,313,4.362068965517241
4692954,1,B005GP7F4S,"I was a big fan of Pablo Francisco's after having seen his ""Bits and Pieces"" DVD, which was one of the best stand-up shows I've seen. Coherent, with structured skits which actually told a story and his impersonations of Keanu Reeves, the Movie Preview Guy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and others were there to support his comedy.

Unfortunately, this time it's the other way around. There is no joke structure or narrative, he does all of his impersonations all the time while telling ""jokes"" that actually aren't that funny either. I chucked a few times during the whole thing and maybe laughed once or twice. Yeah, it's only 7 bucks, so get it if you're a hardcore fan, but otherwise I'd recommend other comedians, the great late George Carlin for example. Or simply go and watch Stewart and Colbert every week for free on TV.",1323216000,2,822,4.748251748251748
4692955,3,B005GP7F4S,"Pablo had the seeds of a genius of absurdist comedy in his prior shows. Complex situational comedy - biting and hilarious, peppered with split second shifts in personality, expression, sounds and layers upon layers of humor.

His shows were dominated by perfectly exaggerated personalities and stories so fast paced and incredible that just stopping to sip your beer for a second meant you would miss out on at least 2-3 side splitting moments in the blink of an eye. My friends and I would leave his sought out live shows with bruised lungs from laughing so hard and red faced from having to stop laughing to breath. Each show was cathartic: therapy for the truly mad world we live in - 2 hours of escape and an ambitious self review of our own lives through the lens of stand up comedy. The parody and sophistication was amazing - he was top of the world in my personal comedy rankings and there was nobody even close.

Lately though his live shows have become much more join the dot comedy - as this video shows. Still really funny and smart - but a more disconnected arrays of characters and impressions with one liners thrown in and occasional ad-lib - often quite geo-specific such as the AllState guy (luckily I've lived across the US and know who this is - but not everyone). As a Brit who lives on the twisted and sarcastic whit and absurdity in my stand up humor, I hope Pablo steps back a little and winds back to the fantastic cathartic comedyland only he can create. I miss the Nascar guy and derivatives, the hipster goth and metal band dudes and their troubled song writing lives, the perfect US suburban robo-dads, goth kids, the crazy girlfriends and the myriad Pablo-speak mentaloids. Pablo - if you are listening, please bring back the stuff that required close attention and stacked thought - you're the best at it there is! This video does't do you justice.",1321660800,3,1878,4.619760479041916
4692956,1,B005GP7F4S,"Pablo Francisco was my favorite comedian, which is why it was so disappointing to watch this performance. I have been a fan since I saw him on Comedy Central Presents in 1998. I saw him at the Improv in Hollywood in 2005 and he was hilarious. I attended this taping expecting nothing but greatness, seeing as how ""Ouch"" was a flawless masterpiece. The same cannot be said for this atrocity of a show. His jokes no longer have stories, he now gets laughs by solely making a bunch of noises and impersonations. These aspects were an added bonus to the joke in the past, not the focal point. At least his impersonations had a place in the joke in his previous sets (the movie voice guy for example.) Now its as if he just uses them to get a cheap laugh and it gets old. His subject matter is out of date and irrelevant at this point, and I expected to see all new material and a set that would at least have coherent flow of some kind. It seems as though he hastily threw this act together, which was completely unexpected for someone who hasn't had a standup special in a few years. Sadly, he now seems like a comedian whose style is comparable to that of Larry the Cable Guy or Jeff Dunham as far as having a schtick goes. Very unfortunate.",1320969600,17,1239,4.299145299145299
4692957,5,B005GP7F4S,I don't know what it is about Pablo but I think he is freaking hilarious! I love his energy and different characters.  Definitely a 5 star effort.,1319500800,,146,4.407407407407407
4692958,5,B005GP7F4S,"There isn't one special I have missed that Pablo has been in.

Bits and Pieces was amazing. When I had a party, that was the very first thing I would put on, forget music, it was all about Pablo Francisco...If you didn't think he was funny, than you don't have a sense of humor. I had been tweeting him for a while now and he started following me, messaging myself and Lizz every day. We became good friends and he finally got to see me at the San Jose Improv.

He signed 2 DVD's, Ouch and Bits and Pieces for my boyfriend and I and a day later, I got another copy of Ouch signed in the front. I can't wait until his next special and the laugh riots we will have.

One day Pablo will be the death of me. I will probably laugh to death because of his comedy.",1319500800,3,757,4.0

8472010,1,B005GP7F4S,"I use to really like Pablo Francisco and remembered was really funny a few years ago. So one night when I was bored I decided to check it out again. Well...its a little outdated. Just a lot of weird noises and you'd probably laugh harder at a circus. Unfortunately, I do not recommend this one. My recommendation only goes as far as watching if for 5 mins on tv for free if any TV Channel would stoop that low and make fun it with your friends...cause even your dumb impersonation of the ""what does the fox say"" song is funnier than this guy.",1397433600,,542,4.271844660194175
