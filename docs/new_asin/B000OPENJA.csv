8185959,4,B000OPENJA,"'World of Warcraft Burning Crusade' is as the cover reads, a peek behind the scenes of the release of the expansion set 'Burning Crusade' as it prepares to join the family of the mega-phenomenally successful series of RP/PvP on-line PC games and corresponding TCG. The DVD is extremely short, taking approximately fifteen to twenty minutes to view and its contents are something that only the true gamer can enjoy. The discussion sessions recorded at BlizzCon (Blizzard Convention) in '05 where the creators of World of Warcraft expound on the features and functionality of different aspects of the game are a perfect example of what I'm saying. Any non-gamer watching would have absolutely no idea what anybody is talking about. On the other hand, if you are counted among the millions of hardcore players out there, welcome to ""Gamers Paradise!""",1229385600,,847,5.100719424460432
