3937347,4,B002IVDLGY,"Winner of the best director award in the Cannes film festival, the 1987 German film ""WINGS OF DESIRE"" (original title: Der Himmel ber Berlin = Heaven Over Berlin) inspired the Hollywood film directed by Brad Silberling called ""City of Angels"" which became a box-office success. This film was inspired by the poetry written by Rainer Maria Rilke and was followed by a sequel called ""Faraway, So Close"".  This German film goes into the belief that the grass is greener on the other side and that something so different can be so enticing. Like everything else, the original is always better (about 99.9% of the time) and Criterion finally brings this beautiful film into a fully restored edition.

Berlin, just before the end of the Cold War, Damiel (Bruno Ganz, Downfall) and Cassiel (Otto Sander, Das Boot) are two angels who travel high and above to observe, testify and preserve; they also listen to the thoughts of people in the streets of Berlin. The two are angels ever since the dawn of time; and although they are angels, they cannot interact, unseen to all except to innocent children. During one of their travels, Cassiel becomes intrigued by an old man named Homer (Curt Bois) who dreams of epic peace and Damiel slowly begins to fall in love for a female trapeze performer named Marion (Solveig Dommartin) who is very talented but also very lonely. Eventually, Damiel longs for physicality and to take on human form. He forsakes his immortality and begins to bleed, taste and see the world in color. Damiel is about to embark on a new experience...

Director Wim Wenders co-wrote the film's script with Peter Handke (who also wrote the film's recurring poem ""Song of Childhood). Much of the film's dialogue feels, sounds and exudes pure poetry throughout and the film's narrations and the dialogue is so beautiful.

""...When a child was child, I didn't know it was a child, everything was soulful and all souls were one.""

The film is also mostly shot in black and white; in effect this represents the angels' viewpoint that the physical world is without color and nothing could attract more attention than the other. It was a clever touch to see through the eyes of someone who is supposed to be impartial or as Cassiel had stated to ""testify"" when the time had come. I think the black and white also represents the fact that the angels have no cause for emotion and care. Immortality and eternity also seems very attractive but it does come with a price. (please keep in mind that the angels in the film are ones portrayed by the director, seen through the eyes of a human and not to be mistaken as fact)

The film's opening act was full of visual poetry as the two angels observe and listen to everyday walks of human life; they are fascinated and at the same time genuinely concerned about us mere mortals. Through their eyes, humanity is represented through our hopes and dreams, our fears and worries and above all the need to be loved and to love. The direction manages to represent both the beauty and the ugliness of humanity; Director Wenders made the right call in shooting the film in Berlin during the days when the wall was still up, and the city while depressing, exposes the strengths and the fragilities of the human spirit. It was no surprise that Damiel would be fascinated with what he saw.

What I got from the film is the message that life is precious and that every waking hour is important. The angels in this film have no emotion, and I think that when Cassiel and Damiel touches a human who is depressed or thinking of suicide, they are trying to understand the emotions that swell within the heart. I guess humans have a way to bring out the most extreme emotions by reflecting on their hardships and their own lives. Being human has its merits and someone different sees the beauty of things we usually take fore granted. Humans can feel, and for an intangible angel, it seems very curious. Peter Falk also stars as himself, and Wenders gives his character an enigmatic feel as later revealed in the film's final act.

The love story between Damiel and Marion may seem to be the film's focal point, but the direction remembers to show the beauty that is Berlin. As I've said, this film is more than a love story, it brings humanity itself into exposition. The depressing populace and the circus scenes served Wenders' intentions quite well. The beautiful dialogue, (Marion's speech was just full of poetic meaning that it would just turn any woman into putty) the visual style all complement each other.  One small fault the film may have is the fact that the movie is not for everyone, it has a sleepy feel and may be too cryptic and poetic for its own good. Mainstream audiences would become bored while those who appreciate stunning cinema would praise Wenders' work.

""Wings of Desire"" is the type of film that may require multiple viewings and I think each viewing may change one`s opinion of the film. There is an abundant use of symbolisms in the film and one would have fun trying to decipher each one. The film is indeed special, and transcends any elementary classification one may become tempted to staple it with.

Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]

Note: If you own the MGM release of the film, this Criterion release is very much worth the double dip. This new DVD release looks and sounds better than the previous release.",1257638400,4,5373,4.691082802547771
3937348,5,B002IVDLGY,"The first disc features an audio commentary that actually consists of excerpts of interviews with director Wim Wenders and actor Peter Falk over several years. Wenders talks about the origins of Wings of Desire - it was a return to his hometown of Berlin after spending eight years in the United States. He had planned to make another film but it was too complex and expensive. He had to come up with another idea and quick or the production company he had assembled would break up. This fascinating anecdote is only one of many engaging stories as the two men tell all kinds of filming tales. They do a good job of taking us through the making of this film.

Also included are the German theatrical trailer and an amusing ""Wen Wunderts"" promo trailer.

The second disc features the bulk of the extra material, starting off with ""The Angels Among Us,"" a 2003 documentary where key cast and crew members are interviewed. Wenders wanted to make a film about Berlin, the way he remembered it when he was young. Peter Handke talks about his unconventional approach to the script. For the two main angels, Wenders cast Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander based on their 20-year friendship and working relationship. Everyone speaks quite eloquently about their experiences making Wings of Desire.

""Cinema Cinemas"" features an interview with Wenders from the February 17, 1987 episode of this French television program. We see Wenders at work on the set of Wings of Desire with his cast and crew shooting scenes from the film.

Also included are nine deleted scenes with commentary by Wenders and outtakes but only with music. Not surprisingly, there is a lot of footage of the angels observing humanity. The outtakes feature all sorts of beautiful shots of Berlin.

There is also a gallery of production design photographs that also highlight the film's gorgeous art direction. Included are captions that comment on some of these stills.

Also included is an interview excerpt from an interview with director of photography Henri Alekan done in November 1985. He talks about the challenge of achieving the right tone and atmosphere in a film.

""Alekan la Lumiere"" features excerpts from a 1985 documentary where Alekan talks to Wenders about his cinematic techniques. There is also footage of him at work.

Finally, there is an excerpt from Remembrance, a 1982 film directed by Ganz and Sander about actor Curt Bois who went on to appear in Wings of Desire.",1257379200,5,2443,4.884057971014493
3937349,5,B002IVDLGY,"No movie that I see on a regular basis makes me feel so powerfully the joy of being alive as this one. Although many films and numberless and sappy television shows since 1987 have used angels of one dreadful sort or another, Wim Wenders managed to success while all the others failed. Working from a story by celebrated writer Peter Handke, Wenders takes angels that seem to have more in common with Rilke's Duino Elegies than the Bible or the New Age angels. Their function is to watch and observe and record, and in their own limited fashion, to comfort and commiserate. The trick wasn't to come up with the gimmick of angels being able to listen to the thoughts of humans, but to make those thoughts beautiful and representative of all that is quintessentially human. The trick wasn't to have the angels see in black and white and the humans in color, but in making what was seen, whether two or many toned, beautiful. One has only to see the absolutely appalling CITY OF ANGELS, an English language remake starring Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage, to see that having gimmicks isn't enough; you must have substance as well.

This is not a perfect film. There are some dull moments, and I thoroughly dislike a couple of moments in the film, in particular, Dommartin's speech to Bruno Ganz in the bar near the end of the film. But there are so many magnificent moments, so many moments where they not merely get something right, but produce a moment of almost transcendent beauty, that WINGS OF DESIRE provides more than entertainment, but something akin to a reason to live. The movie becomes in the end a celebration of life, of all the tawdry elements that go into being human. The movie ends in affirming nearly as many things as Walt Whitman does in ""Song of Myself.""

I love the cast. Bruno Ganz is perfect as Damiel, the central angel of the story. Likewise, Otto Sander's face is the perfect receptacle for all that he witnesses on his silent rounds through Berlin, while Solveig Dommartin is so sympathetic a character, so lovely, that one could imagine an angel or anyone else yearning to be with her. And Peter Falk turns in a remarkably quirky character role, playing himself on location in Berlin. The city itself emerges as a major actor, providing what is certain to stand as the last great visual representation of Berlin in the last couple of years before the Wall fell. Curt Bois was a veteran character actor who was a staple in Hollywood films in the 1930s and 1940s, playing a vast number of waiters and tailors and hotel clerks (he plays the pickpocket at the very beginning of CASABLANCA). In what would be the last role before his death, Bois appropriately plays ""Homer,"" the ancient man remembering all that had occurred in Berlin in the past several decades, playing the role of human witness to counterbalance the angelic witnesses.

This film and UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD, a Wenders film that followed this one in 1991 have to have two of the best soundtracks I have encountered. Subtract either ""Six Bells Chime"" by Crime and the City Solution or ""From Her to Eternity"" by Nick Cave, and this would have been far less of a film, and the scene where Solveig Dommartin changes in her trailer while listening to Nick Cave do ""The Carny"" might be the best scene in the film.",1256947200,20,3298,4.624573378839591
3937350,5,B002IVDLGY,"There are few movies that stay with you long after the credits have rolled and the auditorium lights have come up.  This is one of them.

I saw this many years ago in a high school Humanities class and always wanted to purchase it.  When it came out on DVD I snagged a copy to finally own.  It was as good or better than I remembered it.  That was a span of some 15 or so years.

What more can I say?  Powerful, evocative, thought provoking, sublime, and deeply, satisfactorily moving.  Pure, high artistry and poetry on a short list of classic European films, and on a whole other plain of existence from most American ""art"" films.  A story of Shakespearean grandeur on celluloid.

The images linger, the narration haunts.  Black and white and color filmstock are brilliantly utilized in fantastic and complimentary combination used to represent the ethereal and more mundane, Earthbound realms the characters dwell in.

Wings of Desire is arguably filmmaker and music video director Wim Wenders' finest masterpiece to date.  Don't let ""Music Video Director"" scare you off.  Wim is no Michael Bay or McG.  He actually has talent and is very much akin to Spike Jonze in creating fantastical flights of fancy, though with more cerebral and philosophically provoking undertones.

That Wings of Desire is now on Blu-ray in a stunning HD transfer, is something to be celebrated.",1256515200,9,1374,4.832618025751073
3937351,5,B002IVDLGY,"I've seen this movie at the cinema by the time it was released, in the late 80's. Even today I watch it with the same fascination. it's a completely different film from all others I've ever see. it's a film of making good, of angels, of real people's daily dramas. It's about Berlin, the walled city. it's about love between an circus artist and an angel. it's about images, feelings, memories.

it has an atonishingly beautiful photography of Henri Alekan. a wonderful music soundtrack, with the participation of  Nick Cave and the Crime and the City Solution, among others. it transmits the way Wim Wenders looks at the world.

it was one of the last movies about the walled city of Berlin. soon after the wall fell down

there are three movies that took the major role to make what I am today: Fellini's ""Armacord"", Lynch's ""Wild at heart"" and this movie.

often I see it one more time. it's a movie to go on watching, not just to see and forget

A must see movie.",1254441600,8,220,4.7894736842105265
3937353,5,B002IVDLGY,"This is Wim Wenders's greatest film (or damn near close to it), a really moving, beguiling, haunting masterpiece, and it's also arguably the last great film he ever did.  It's also his poetic film, a real work of art that grows in wonder every time you see it.

The film concerns itself with angels longing to be human.  The lead angel (played wonderfully by Bruno Ganz) falls in love with a trapeze artist, played lovingly by Solveig Dommnartin.  She has an etheral, other worldy beauty that is wonderful.  You can see why an angel would become human just for her.  The cinematography alters between shimmering black and white, which is reminiscent of Cocteau's work (it is not surprising, as Henri Alekan, Cocteau's cinematographer, shot this film), and lovely colour cinematography.  The poems of Rainer Maria Rilke also figure  heavily in this film, and they give the film a profound, poetic grace that isn't really in any of Wenders's work.  Wenders's early German work is very good, but it dealt mostly with alienation and wandering (his production company is called Road Movies), but here in Wings of Desire he goes deeper than just wandering and makes what is arguably his most potent, memorable film.  Even the inclusion (which might strike some as bizarre) of Peter Falk around the end of the film works wonderfully.  Whereas an idiot director would throw the inclusion of ""Columbo"" just to be different and ""edgy"", Wenders avoids that.  Falk is very warm and self effacing here, and his casting totally works.  It's actually a masterstroke, as it gives the film an even greater dimension.

It's a shame that Wenders's career faltered after this.  His next film, Until the End of the World, was a ripe mess (reportedly, his cut was four hours, and he was forced to edit it down to 2 1/2 hours), and the sequel to Wings of Desire, Faraway So Close!, had some wonderful moments but was way too preachy, didatic, and ponderous, and nowhere as good as Wings of Desire was.  None of this detracts from the fact that Wings of Desire is one of the best films ever made about angels, and one of Wenders's greatest achievements.",1252800000,3,2129,4.775956284153006

Peter Falk's character is a nice touch in bridging the mortal and angel 'gap'. Don't waste your time on the remake ""City of Angels"" - as usual, the remake falls way short of the original's more ethereal feel.

3937375,5,B002IVDLGY,"What an enchanting and thought-provoking movie!  The basic premise is that there are angels watching over the earth -- or maybe only Berlin, where, God knows, they needed angels during the Cold War -- and it's Wim Wenders's conceit that these angels have relatively limited power.  They can hear people's thoughts, and they can invisibly touch them and bring some strength and comfort in times of stress, but they seem to have no power over people's choices, and appropriately therefore, they are a rather sober group, with their dark overcoats and neck-scarves neatly tucked in, whose demeanor suggests patience and resignation more than anything else.  They seem to like to hang around the library when things are quiet, although, of course, they're invisible to the workers and patrons, and in that setting they have the air of a group taking a break from a Board meeting of a non-profit organization.  They seem kindly, but a bit detached -- the demeanor of medical staff in an ICU, perhaps?  When filming is done in black and white, it becomes clear to us that we are seeing from an angelic perspective; when color is employed, it's as if we're seeing through human eyes.  The quality of the color is distinctive, though -- often it seems like the color of an illustrated children's book rather than ""standard"" realistic color.  Just putting it like that overstates the matter a bit . . . but there is something odd and arresting about it.  At times we're given the impression that very young children can see the angels.

The angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) seems a tad more animated in expression than the others, including his angel buddy Samiel (Otto Sander), and it turns out that that's because he is seriously interested in human beings to the extent of renouncing his angelic status and becoming human.  It seems that angels can make that choice -- Damiel doesn't have to request a transfer from anyone higher-up.  In fact, there's no hint of any omnipotent authority ""higher up.""  His decision isn't sudden, so we see a lot from the angelic perspective -- but what pulls him towards earth is his interest in a trapeze artiste, Marion (Solveig Dommartin), and his scenes with her while he is still an angel and invisible are an odd blend of the tender and the voyeuristic, although the voyeurism (and I'm not sure that that's the best word) seems innocent, purged of any salacious intent even as it suggests an erotic attraction too.  How Wenders and, especially, Ganz convey that quality of interest is one of the miracles of the movie.

So what is the attraction of the human or of Marion?  It seems to me -- plunging boldly into interpretation here -- that it has something to do with aspiration.  As a trapeze artiste, Marion wants to fly -- shall we say, to escape the surly bonds of earth? -- but not to escape the human necessarily, nor simply to experience ecstasy.  Rather, it seems that in her mind there's a sense of a better quality of life that it makes sense to keep present to one's consciousness as being worth aspiring to.  And it strikes me that the experience of that aspiring is something that Damiel wants and hence finds attractive in Marion.  As an angel, after all, aspiration is closed to him, but, as Blake says, ""Eternity is in love with the productions of time,"" and that means work and imagination (or fantasy) and aspiration.  The little circus that Marion works in is an embodiment of the need for fantasy and the joy of meeting that need, even in a modest way.

And that brings us to politics.  From the angelic perspective -- often rendered in high overhead shots (balloon or helicopter?) -- the city is beautiful with an odd combination of order and irregularity.  The angelic perspective is almost an aesthetic one -- or maybe, from a human viewpoint, a slightly anaesthetic one.  But the ground level pictures remind us that Berlin is a divided city -- there is the wall, and there are the waste spaces still left over from World War 2.  And there is Peter Falk, playing himself as a visitor to Berlin, there to make a WW2 movie, on the set of which we see the Nazi uniforms and the prison camp beds.  Nothing is SAID about the wall and the divisions it represents, and on the movie set, we hear words relating only to the practicalities of getting a day's shoot in.  Occasionally we see in color a bit of film from the war -- burning buildings, ruins -- as if to tell us that such are the memories of some of Berlin's population.  There's something ironic about the ease with which Damiel can cross over from the angelic to the human in the context of a city in which the earthbound pictures speak of the barriers to crossing in the human world.  The sense of barriers is present too in our hearing of the unspoken thoughts of the Berliners that the angels are overhearing, thoughts important, often vitally so, to the thinker but unshared and isolating.  Wenders's vision in the movie seems to tie aspiration to a breaking of barriers and an explicit sharing of ones inmost thoughts, and that I think is why the climax of the movie consists of a long speech by Marion, who has become aware of Damiel's interest.  He has in his human state traced her with difficulty to a Nick Cave concert (plenty to think about there!) and they meet up in a nearby bar afterwards.  The importance of the speech is that it IS speech, not reverie or inner soliloquy, and if I'm right about that, worries about its being boring or about its substance can be set aside.  This is not a movie that abides by the canons of realism.

But isn't it too sentimental, finally?  Well, no -- at the end, we see the words ""To Be Continued,"" and while I haven't seen the sequel, I've heard that it embraces a darkness in the human world that we don't see here and that isn't simply a matter of politics.  So savor the sentiment, and even if you're not inclined to see the sequel, remember the Wall and the War, which this movie doesn't let us forget.  I should just add that Wenders, with the alternation of overhead and ground-level shots, and the alternation of color and B&W,  establishes a visual rhythm that holds our interest despite a fractured narrative and that there's more humor in the movie than my comments have suggested.  Finally, the whole thing with Peter Falk is just sheer genius.",1418601600,5,6312,4.616830796777082

The second viewing was not so overwhelming. I got the feeling my first reaction was due mostly to the film's strangeness. Much of the story is told through the characters' inner thoughts, which strike me as too-often overly complex or unduly ""philosophical"". They might not come across that way in German, but they seem that way in English. It's only at the end when the trapeze artist and the ex-angel meet, and she says she's tired of accidents and coincidence, and wants a relationship that has innate meaning, that I felt deeply moved.

Whether this is a truly ""great"" film I leave up to the viewer -- but it's a film you must see.

This is a review of the MGM DVD. Visually, it does not impress. The sepia sequences have a blotchy, sometimes smeary look. The color sequences are okay, but don't create a strong contrast with the sepia. (This is difficult to judge, as I have no idea what Wenders had in mind.)

There is so much deep wisdom in it, that it is has value in really being able to sit with the questions it asks and the wisdom if gives  by giving us a view of being a human being from someone who wishes they were. Also I did not remember that Peter Faulk was in the movie, so was pleasantly surprised to find him in a foreign film, with moments of english speaking in the midst of it, as moments of color in the midst of black and white. There is a famous library scene in City of Angles that I love, that I later found out was filmed in the San Francisco Library. I had the opportunity to visit that library and was immediately reminded of that scene. This version also has some beautiful scenes.

I had wanted to invite my mother to watch this with me, but she does not really like older movies. Now after watching it, I am glad she was not with me because she definitely would  not have liked it, she would have thought it to be way too slow and especially not worth the subtitles.",1385424000,,1471,4.027397260273973
3937383,4,B002IVDLGY,"While ""Wings of Desire"" is a genuine work of art, gently crafted, well conceived, beautifully acted - it's slower than molasses on a cold day, and if you're an impatient viewer who quickly grasps the concept of omnipresent angels, you'll be ready for the love story to begin long before it does.  I've reviewed ""City of Angels"", the rather pathetic knockoff of ""Wings of Desire"" with little of the comprehension or uniqueness, and suggest you not waste your viewing time on the former but sit back, relax and revel in the grace and beauty of the latter.  Bruno Ganz was gorgeous then; the acrobatic object of his affection is believable, and I'd fall in love with her myself if I was a man or an immortal.  The world of angels which co-exists with our natural world is pokey as hell to watch, but then eternity is probably pretty dull on a day-to-day basis as well.

3937389,5,B002IVDLGY,"Originally titled Der Himmel ber Berlin (The Heavens Over Berlin), Wings of Desire tells the story of how immortal angels observe the day to day lives of human beings, sometimes merely watching and sometimes lending a reassuring nudge, but always very eager to interact with and observe these people made in their image. However, one angel, Damiel, who along with his best friend Cassiel has been assigned the city of Berlin, wants to do more than merely observe! He longs to experience even the most mundane things the humans he watches experience.

Cassiel disapproves, but doesn't dissuade his companion, as he himself is becoming a bit disillusioned with simply sitting on the sidelines, himself. When Damiel sees and falls in love with a beautiful French trapeze artist named Marion and with encouragement from a former angel who ""fell"" and turned human (a gentle Peter Falk playing a fictionalized version of himself), Damiel decides to take the ""fall"" and become a human being, whilst Cassiel, disturbed when he cannot stop a young man from committing suicide, turns his efforts to helping an old professor named Homer in his efforts to write a novel that is an ""epic of peace,"" instead of an epic of war.

Unlike its later remake, City of Angels, Wings of Desire has its protagonist angel wanting to be human before he meets the female love interest, and for reasons other than simply love and sex; he just wants to be high on life and experience the things we humans do and take for granted. The subplots with the film actor and the old professor wanting to write an interesting story free of conflict, and the various motifs of how Germany is separated by the Berlin Wall and still dealing with the haunting ghosts of World War II while still trying to get on in the world, are very interesting also. A highly recommended film for those of you with patience and tender hearts.",1338940800,3,1886,4.782208588957055
3937390,5,B002IVDLGY,"I saw this movie in its entirety for the first time the other night on TCM, where it was introduced by actress Debra Winger as one of her favorite films.  I can't say it's a flawless movie (it's a little longwinded), but still I give it five stars.  Why?  Because it's a movie that has much to offer on many different levels.  It can be watched as pure cinema, because the camerawork is so lyrical... without sound or subtitles it would still be wonderful.

The ""angels"" are perfect existential outsiders, in the mode of Camus or Magritte.  Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice as an actor, with his large, dolorous eyes taking all of humanity in.  Without much of a script, apparently, the movie is still satisfactory because it follows many paths.  Ganz' angel becomes infatuated with a trapeze artist.  His partner is attentive to the musings of an old man.  There is plenty of pathos.  Peter Falk provides necessary grounding and humor.  All this takes place in a ""haunted"" city, Berlin, which seems caught with one foot in the past and one in the future, perpetual limbo.

All of the communication comes in the form of private thoughts, which combine to form a sort of reverie.  In addition, there is a voice-over which quotes Rilke poetry, or at least poetry inspired by Rilke.

The movie seems to restate or build upon a foundation of modern cinema.  It echoes some early Fellini masterpieces like ""8 1/2"" and ""La Strada"" with their stories of humanity amidst ruins and cold concrete.  It also relates to New Wave French cinema.  And with the inclusion of club performances by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, it links immediately to a time period (the 80's), much like Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" with its performance by the Yardbirds stamped the imprint of London and the 1960's on that film.

""Wings of Desire"" does indeed contain what Debra Winger describes as ""fierce beauty"".  Its aspirations lift it to the heights of Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Cocteau, and few others.",1337990400,,1968,4.732352941176471

Nick Cave's poseur song and the woman's trite monologue undo every ounce of resonance.  Roger Ebert is dead wrong about this film.",1337299200,3,281,5.043478260869565
3937392,5,B002IVDLGY,"The bulk of the film is in German, although some dialogue is in English. There are also occasional moments in French and Turkish.

Although this review contains spoilers, there's not really much to spoil. Each viewer will get something different from the film. The events are merely a loose framework used to provoke thought.

Wings of Desire is not an easy film to watch. It requires a lot of patience and you'll get very little from it if you aren't prepared to think. It's one of those stories that shows you events or allows you to hear thoughts, and then you make of it what you will. There isn't a conventional plot at all. If you watched The Tree of Life and had problems with its abstract narrative, Wings of Desire will test you even more. It's almost like a poem.

The story involves two immortal angels, Cassiel (Sander) and Damiel (Ganz), who have existed for millennia. The setting is Berlin, but the angels knew the city before humans ever existed. They remember how the river found its bed and how life as we know it began. They are serious and rarely show any emotion. Perhaps they have seen everything and it no longer affects them, or is their dispassionate outlook part of their very nature?

Their job is to observe humans and we see through their eyes in black and white. They can hear the thoughts of everyone they pass. Occasionally, when someone is sad or contemplating a desperate act, the angels intervene by touching the shoulder of the person in trouble. This gives that person a sense of hope and well being, but there's no guarantee the person will act on it. Children are able to see angels. Perhaps their innocence and lack of cynicism allows them to see what adults cannot?

Thoughts are usually presented as whispers, so the majority of the film feels very peaceful and relaxing. From the angels' point of view, it can be noisy when a large number of people are concentrated in a small space. We see some of these encounters on the street and in a public library. It's not clear why the angels are watching. Yes, they sometimes intervene and provide comfort, but they are mainly observing human behavior. They sometimes record unusual behavior in a notebook and talk about it among themselves.

As I mentioned, the film doesn't offer much guidance and won't tell you what conclusions to draw from the behavior of the angels. It will mean something different to everybody.

There are two other elements woven into the mix:

The first shows Marion (Dommartin), who is a female trapeze artist. She is temporarily working at a local circus and we discover from her thoughts that she's unhappy and lonely. She desperately wants to be loved. When she's alone, she listens to Nick Cave's music and dreams of one day finding someone.

The other thread involves Peter Falk, playing himself. His inclusion was a stroke of genius. Falk thinks in unusual ways and can sense the presence of angels. He talks to Damiel at one point and says that he wishes Damiel could experience things as he does. The pleasure of drinking coffee, smoking, or rubbing his hands together when he's cold. He's not afraid to talk to angels even though other people look at him as if he is crazy. The reason that he can do this is startling, but I won't reveal it here.

After about 90 minutes of showing us the angels in action, the film takes a sudden turn. Damiel has been observing Marion and has fallen in love with her. He wants to take the plunge and become a mortal human being in the hope that she will return his feelings. He wants to feel, touch, smell, taste and experience what it is like to really be alive.

Nick Cave has another part to play in the conclusion and we hear his thoughts while he is performing. His final song is From Her to Eternity, which is extremely appropriate in the context of the story.

The film switches from black and white to color when we see events from the viewpoint of humans rather than angels. It's particularly effective when Damiel is able to experience life fully for the first time.

For the majority of the film, the camera shows us what the angels see. This has the effect of making us observers too, and we can imagine what it would be like to witness so much joy and suffering, while only occasionally intervening. What is Wim Wenders asking us to see? Is it an invitation to contemplate the meaning of our existence?

3937396,5,B002IVDLGY,"Soon after I began studying German in 1990, I discovered this film and was able to purchase a book of the screenplay. Since I already spoke fluent French, and since the film is a mixture of German, French and English (the scenes with Peter Falk), it was a natural for me. I really studied this film, and I soon came to regard it as a German ""Citizen Kane"". The fact that it occurs in a still divided Berlin, with the Angels walking through the wall in the midst of one of my favorite conversations (about what they had witnessed there from shortly after the creation to the present) adds immensely to the film's flavor.  I can understand why some people find it annoying, because the dialogue is quite philosophical, and the various people's thoughts, as heard by the angels, can be overwhelming at times, especially when multiple thought streams crowd in. And yet the philosophical parts, as expressed by the angels, an elderly man named Homer (the story teller), the French trapeze artist (the woman with whom Damien, one of the angels, falls in love), even Peter Falk, are what make this film a masterpiece. The trapeze artist's monologue when Damien finds her toward the end of the film is positively brilliant.  For escapist entertainment, many may well prefer the American remake, ""City of Angels"", which modifies the plot and drops the philosophy, but for pure genius, it is difficult to beat Wim Wenders' film.",1299369600,7,1418,4.783673469387755

This is a film you ""float"" with; just let go and let it take you where it will. Personally, I felt more alive - revived, if you will - immediately after my first viewing.",1296259200,7,430,4.011627906976744
3937398,2,B002IVDLGY,"I purchased this movie because it was from the presitigious Criterion Collection and based on all of the postiive reviews in here.  In general I am a fan of slower paced, character driven movies that make you think/feel.  Happy ending or sad ending?  No matter.  Just tell your story well and I will be a satisfied viewer.

I know I am in the vast minority in my opinion of this movie, but for me Wings of Desire was a great concept that was absolutely decimated in the execution of the tale.  The continous return to the angels hovering over their ""clients"" was completely unnecessary and ground the story to a halt.

After the first fifteen minutes when the two angels were talking together in the car, I sat up and said to myself, ""Wow, what a great set up.  Now let's see where they take the story"".  Only to be thrusted right back into the same mechanism.  People babbling on about their troubles with the angels whispering over their shoulders.

I immediately found myself saying, ""Wait.  I've already just experienced that for the first ten minutes of the movie.  Why are we returning to this vehicle again""?  Ten more minutes go by.  Another brief exchange to move the story forward.  And then back we go again.  ANOTHER ten/fifteen minutes of the device.  I found this to be utterly meaningless.  It became the equivalent of sitting through 400 confessionals at a church, while none of them have anything to do with the story.

I don't want to reveal the plot so I will speak cryptically for those who have already seen the movie.  Regarding what little plot the movie does expound upon with the trapeze artist, the conversation at the bar at the end was off-the-charts unrewarding.  I stuck around for the end to see what the payoff would be, and I was so unfulfilled.

I give this movie two stars because the premise was extremely interesting and the execution was certainly not aimed at the Hollywood schmaltz loving audience of yesterday/today.  But just because a movie is avant-garde, it doesn't make it good.  And in this case, I would highly recommend you rent Wings of Desire before purchasing it.

UPDATE: 12/2011 - With movies like this I usually like to go back a second time and rewatch them to see if I just missed the point/vibe/feel etc..  I just finished rewatching this again and my first impression stands even stronger.  I actually listened to a bit of the director's commentary this time, and while most of the screenplay was written by the director, a few key scenes, including the end of the movie with the trapeze artist were actually written by someone else.  This doesn't suprise me one bit.  It's a completely circular exposition that fails to bring home one ounce of the emotive quality that meeting/scene begged for in concept.  I suppose for ""art's sake"", this may be rewarding to some.  But for me, it was yet another massively missed opportunity in a movie littered with them.

I REALLY wanted to like this movie.

I see most people here don't agree with my review and consider this movie a masterpiece.  I take no exception to that at all.  Art obviously speaks to us all in different ways.

The basic story is of an angle that after recording life falls in love with life, not just the trapezes artist that he eventually wants to meet in the flesh. We get to follow his transition blow by blow, as he attempts to follow his desire.

Peter Falk as Der Filmstar is a catalyst and the glue to the story. I even mention that Colombo did not have a hat.

The film started out unscripted and the directors and writers had to punt. You may notice this as the story improves. There was a partial start script from Paris Texas.

I took a German class or several about the time of this film. Therefore, some of the film language is natural, some, I recognize after the subtitles and some is new. No one slurs the words so this would be a great training film. However, I never made it there so this is as close as I will ever get to 1987 Berlin.

The DVD has a great commentary by director Wim Wenders and Peter Falk, which lets you see what is attempted in the film. So did they accomplish what they set out to do?

3937409,5,B002IVDLGY,"Wim Wender's deliberately paced, hauntingly realized contemporary masterpiece, Wings of Desire is, all at once: a political allegory for the reunification of Germany, an existential parable on a soul's search for connection, a metaphor for the conflict between, what Friedrich Nietzsche defines as, the Appolinian intellect and the Dionysian passion, a euphemism for creation. A dispassionate angel stands atop a statue on a winter morning, watching over Berlin. His name is Damiel (Bruno Ganz): a spiritual guide for the desperate, an eternal spectator of life. The world is gray through his eyes, unable to experience the subtlety of the hues and textures of physical being. He spends eternity exchanging daily observations, listening to the people's thoughts, comforting the dying. He reveals to a fellow angel, Cassiel (Otto Sander), that he is curious to experience life as a human. One day, while observing a circus rehearsal, he is captivated by Marion, a French trapeze artist practicing her routine in an angel costume. Receiving the news that the circus is closing, she feels profoundly alone, but is consoled by Damiel's empathic presence. He falls in love with her: her grace, passion, melancholy. They are kindred spirits longing to find an inextricable part of their soul that is missing. If Damiel can transfigure, perhaps he can fill the void.

Wenders manifests the recurrent theme of division through long camera shots, filmed downward. Note the the opening scene of the statue, the suicide leap from a building, and Marion's rehearsal. In essence, Damiel is the Apollinian force: pensive, logical, and spiritual. (Note the contrast to Federico Fellini, who uses upward shots in order to symbolize the carnal man seeking spirituality.) Division is also depicted when Cassiel follows a disoriented, elderly man against the backdrop of a prominent Berlin Wall. Cinematically, the angels' perspective is in black and white, while human perspective is shot in color, creating visual duality. Note the chromatic shift in Marion's trailer after Damiel disappears. She is the archetypal Dionysian force: sensual, risk-taker, dreamer. Nietzsche proposes that the cataclysmic fusion of the two diametrically opposed forces results in the birth of tragedy. In the end, we see Damiel looking upward at Marion, holding her safety line. He is no longer an immortal chronicler of history. He, like the epic heroes of Greek mythology, has fallen.",1264809600,2,2449,5.377604166666667

3937412,4,B002IVDLGY,"""Wings of Desire""  beautifully uses the medium of film to create a unique and sometimes surreal viewing experience.  Directed by Wim Wenders, the film centers on two guardian angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) who, along with their fellow guardian angels, bear witness to everything that takes place around them on Earth, specifically the streets of 1987 West Berlin.  Moving invisibly through the city, they observe, collect, and share people's thoughts, fears, and memories.  This is shown in a scene in a public library, where we hear the inner monologues of many people, a technique that suggests switching from one radio station to the next.  In the library, the number of angels is almost as large as the mortals, as each angel seeks something interesting or worthy to commit to memory.  After an eternity of observing, Damiel begins to wonder what it would be like to be mortal.  When he encounters and is attracted to the lonely trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he decides to become human.
 ""Wings of Desire"" is a tough film.  The first two-thirds -- up until Damiel meets Marion -- defy traditional plot narrative, relying instead on philosophical reflections on the human condition.  There are lots of characters, but little time is spent on them.  Wenders concentrates on Marion, an elderly man (Curt Bois) and actor Peter Falk, as himself, who's come to Berlin to make a movie.  If you're willing to be patient, ""Wings of Desire"" pays off in the dreamlike black-and-white and color cinematography of Henri Alekan and a beautiful score by Jurgen Kiepner.
 ""Wings of Desire"" contains the following extras: a booklet with photos, chapter headings, and a critical article; deleted scenes; outtakes; a documentary about the film featuring cast and crew interviews; audio commentary by Wim Wenders and Peter Falk; and theatrical trailers.",1259366400,,1873,5.141914191419142

I liked Wings of Desire the first time I saw it, but this new version is clean and beautiful.  Seeing it this way a second time made more of an impression on me. WOD is a subtle and tender movie about being human, and it is fascinating to learn about how the film was put together.",1257724800,2,394,4.038461538461538

8371197,5,B002IVDLGY,"I have watched this movies several times and really enjoy it.
  Some people complain because it's not in English-just sub-titled-no problem for me because the film does not have a lot of dialog.
  The shots of Berlin when it was still a divided city were beautifully photographed.
  The story line is also great.
  All the actors did a really great job.
  No cussing (one short scene with a woman yelling at a man)-other than that and one quick scene and partial nudity(a short breast shot) this film  could easily be ""g"" rated.  Also a suicide scene-no gore in this scene!",1486944000,,573,4.62
8371198,5,B002IVDLGY,"Criterion films are always amazing. Only the best of world cinema is chosen to be preserved by the Criterion Collection. Wings of Desire is no exception.

This wonderfully shot, wonderfully written, wonderfully archived film is an inspiration. This is the story of love and beauty and loss and unexemption from the pain of that loss that any of us that have known a deep bond with another human being and lived through the ache of days, months, and years  without them know all-too-well. Piercing. Poignant. This is a movie at the height of cinematic reach - and one highly recommended to anyone.

Wings of Desire is the inspiration for Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage's City of Angels, itself a powerful film - but the original stands supreme.

Here, preserved by Janus Films for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, packaged with important extras that not only provide insight into the filming process but also context for the film, you have access to the definitive edition.",1483056000,,973,4.914634146341464
