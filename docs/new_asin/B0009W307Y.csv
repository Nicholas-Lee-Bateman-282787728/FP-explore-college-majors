8067749,3,B0009W307Y,"I saw a bunch of these Bulldog Drummond films recently on TCM and thought I would like to own a few.  The Drummond's are getting very hard to come by, but this single disk DVD has 6 of them on two sides.  The price is terrific, now the drawback.  A couple of these films have been copied so many times they are really starting to show their age. Some are very dark, but for what you are getting, it's a minor flaw.",1437523200,2,414,4.024390243902439

It was such a engaging film for a 1937 B-Mystery I knew I just had to see if they were available for purchase. The answer is.....kind of.

First off, please realize this films are now public domain films, meaning you can find them on YouTube and other type sites (currently NOT on Netflix but hulu appears to have at least some of the films). While there have been many BD films starting back in the silent era and continuing in the mid-1900's my interest was grabbed by the 1930's films featuring John Howard as our hero. This set offers five of his plus one starring a young Ray Milland. Although I liked the that film as a whole, his portrayal of BD wasn't a good as Howard's. As I've watched these I just love the interaction of the main characters: Bulldog (Howard), his fiance Phyllis Clavering (Heather Angel), his trusted friend and ally Algy (Reginald Denny), and his loyal and resourceful butler (E.E. Clive). As the films progress we see other famous or soon-to-be-famous co-stars. John Barrymore as a police commissioner, a very young Anthony Quinn to name a couple.

The quality of the films are not great to say the least. But they are watchable and enjoyable. This set includes the following six 1930's BD films:

Bulldog Drummond's Revenge (Howard, 1937)
Bulldog Dummond Escapes (Milland, 1937)
Bulldog Drummond Comes Back (Howard, 1937)
Bulldog Drummond in Africa (Howard, 1938)
Bulldog Drummond's Peril (Howard, 1938)
Bulldog Drummonds's Secret Police (Howard, 1939)

The only two Howard films not included are Arrest Bulldog Drummond and Bulldog Drummond's Bride, both from 1939.

Overall this set was perfect for me. Even though they are public domain and can be found & watched for free, having these six films on one disk at a very reasonable price (I purchased it from an Amazon seller for $3.99 + shipping) was well worth it for me. Overall I would highly recommend this set for anyone who enjoys those early B-Mystery films.",1434844800,2,2123,4.8054794520547945
8067751,5,B0009W307Y,"I am a huge fan of the ""old-timey"" black & white mysteries - a visual form of comfort food to me.  I had never seen any of the Bulldog Drummond movies and bought this set as I had at least heard of Bulldog Drummond and thought what the heck!  These are a lot of fun and what an absolute treat to find the great Ray Milland starring in one of the episodes.  These are definitely older movies and the transfer/sound is not 100% perfect, but it's close.  A definite advantage to this set is you may watch them on a regular DVD player rather than needing a Blu-Ray player or DVD-play only machine unlike the sets under the Warner Brothers Archive label.  Enjoy!",1386115200,,657,4.308943089430894
8067752,5,B0009W307Y,The image and sound quality is o.k. nothing special.  It's nice to have all the movies on one disc.  When this wasn't OOP it sold for about five dollars.  It's worth that.,1186617600,5,171,4.28125
