8104724,5,B000E371GY,The History Channel's program showing the making of the Model T was wonderful.  Since I own a 1923 Roadster I enjoyed it more than most folks would.  I've already loaned it out to friends.,1264809600,,188,4.5
8104725,1,B000E371GY,"If I could give this ""No Stars"", I would. Please do not be fooled (like I was) about the publication date being different from the previous History Channel video about Model ""T"". This is the same old DVD with some added commentary from sociologists about Henry Ford - most of it an over-simplification - and the same grainy, ugly, black and white footage of old cars, most of them NOT Model T's. The only thing good I can say about this video is that it's short. Surely with these cars still being so popular as restoration projects, and fun to drive antiques, the time has come for someone to do a realy nice, accurate, good quality video on these great cars?",1213747200,2,660,4.462809917355372
8104726,5,B000E371GY,"My new hubby has watched this over, and over and over again.  I recently married into a family of car NUTZ. All in several car clubs, all with Model Ts.  I bought copies of this for all of them for Christmas and they LOVED it, including new Mommy-in-Law.  I also showed it to the members of our local HCCA (Horseless Carriage Clubs of America) and they now want to buy it too.  This is very well done and informative with a great mix of photos, footage and history of the Model T.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.",1167782400,3,516,4.224489795918367
8104727,1,B000E371GY,"Usually anything done by the History Channel is worth buying - this one is not. If I could rate it ""no stars"" - I would. I agree with the other poster. I was expecting nice shots of restored cars, or showing a progression of Model Ts and how they changed through the production dates, or even original footage of the moving assembly line & cars - made so famous by the Model T, and Henry Ford - instead, you get a lot of old, grainy footage - most of it NOT model T , or even Ford for that matter. It looks like the film strips that used put you to sleep in Junior High. Don't bother.",1164931200,10,584,4.0
8104728,1,B000E371GY,"I actually thought that this would be a documentatry of a legendary automobile.  It was simply a biography of Henry Ford, and a overly simplistic one as well.  If you are an antique auto buff, this is not the film for you. A few minutes of some old film footage of a few autos, not all T's, is not very interesting. Maybe if you are a youngster doing a book report...",1147046400,3,367,4.154929577464789
