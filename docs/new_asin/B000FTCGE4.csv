8126364,1,B000FTCGE4,"The Honeymoon DVD just arrived today in the mail at the headquarters of Unforgettable Honeymoons, the sole producers of this DVD.  we can assure anyone reading this that our DVD that Lucky Trader is selling  is not an original brand new Honeymoon DVD as advertised on this sellers site.  This seller has no access to purchasing this DVD new, so it is impossible for them to sell  a new DVD unless they are duplicating it themselves.  the DVD arrived with a torn seal,  and the UPC code on the DVD has been covered up by a replacement one.  This  DVD appears to be copied,  as the front cover of the DVD are not nearly as bright as the original DVD, and the seal is not original.  I should know,  I own the Honeymoon DVD,  and produce it, and do not allow anyone else to sell it.  Lucky Trader does not have an account to purchase our DVD, therefore has no new DVD to sell on Amazon.",1360195200,,882,4.240963855421687
8126365,4,B000FTCGE4,"The resorts on this dvd are beautiful. My husband and I were looking at going to Fiji and wanted help narrowing down which resort to go to. Watching the dvd gives you a good feel of the resorts. However, the owner of Unforgettable Honeymoons cannot be impartial because she endorses a certain resort above the others.",1240876800,,317,4.678571428571429
