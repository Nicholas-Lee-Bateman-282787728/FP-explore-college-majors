3478640,5,B001B187O8,I bought the full set of Charlie and Lola dvds for a 2 1/2 year old after she'd watched some of them at her cousin's house.  She adores them.  Charlie and Lola are gentle fun with real 'brother and sister' interaction.  'S' now uses some of Charlie and Lola's verbiage too.  It's hilarious!,1236124800,,290,4.415094339622642
3478641,5,B001B187O8,"My twin granddaughters are enchanted by Charlie & Lola. They giggle with them and hum along to the theme music. The stories encourage caring about each other, sharing, cooperating and compassion; to say nothing of creativity and fantasy play. I have to say this is the best discovery ever!",1234137600,3,289,4.918367346938775

3478688,5,B001B187O8,"was flipping through the channels one day and happened upon this show. Well I decided to leave it on for background noise but found myself drawn into this cute cartoon. I'm 28 and boy was I surprised that this show was amazing and completely funny and adorable. Being that this is intended for children I still couldn't help watching and very much enjoying it. Both kids and adults will love this series, I know I do!!!",1402012800,,419,4.526315789473684

3478690,5,B001B187O8,"I don't mind this cartoon one bit.  It's so nice to have something that's a bit more slow-moving than what's typically found on tv.  I like that it revolves around a brother and sister duo--and most importantly, my son enjoys traveling with them on their little discoveries.",1401753600,,274,4.808510638297872
3478691,5,B001B187O8,"The DVDs are good for the late 2 and the 3 yr old as it contains subject matter that is familiar, has humor, pathos and language that  can enhance vocabulary.",1399680000,,158,4.266666666666667
3478692,5,B001B187O8,"I had never heard of these books or videos before. i'm the father of a 6 year old girl and we're very protective of what we expose her to on tv. A lot of what we watch is PBS, etc. It was by pure chance that I happened to catch a part of one of these shows live on TV while I was channel surging. Granted, this is a kids show, but it captured MY (the adult) attention right away and I finished watching the show. In fact, I recorded it. Showed it to my daughter a couple days later and she wanted to know if there were any more. Instant hit. I showed it to my wife and she loved it too. This is a rare find people. A wholesome show about a brother and sister who actually get along. The brother shows more patience and kindness to his sister than probably any real brother would his real sister. But it's still really nice, when we're accustomed to watching shows about how DYSFUNCTIONAL families can be in the name of entertainment and comedy, to be able to watch a brother helping his sister, teaching her, taking care of her. And the innocent whimsy and imagination of the sister is really what drives the show. The show tackles topics that are super relevant to ANY kid... fear of failing, how to share, being scared to be away from your parents, losing a tooth, being a picky eater, being scared of things at night, being a good listener, etc. There are at least 3 more volumes that are out there (volumes 9-11) that are not part of this set, but there's no easier, nicer, or better way to get volumes 1-8 all at once. If you have never seen this show, try it right away, you won't be disappointed. And if you have seen the show and you're looking for an easy way to fill out your collection, this is it, look no further. I went ahead and bought volumes 9-11 individually because there's no set for them yet, and those are good too. As always, there's no substitute for parental supervision, even with a show like this. If there are topics you prefer your kids not watch (ie, halloween, death of a pet, etc) then you should bypass those. But every topic is handled carefully and in a kid friendly and wholesome way.",1394668800,,2120,4.26302729528536
3478693,5,B001B187O8,"Best DVDs I have ever purchased. They are a no-brainer to pop in for any age. There is nothing controversial or questionable, just good, clean, laugh out loud fun.

3478704,5,B001B187O8,"All my grandchildren have loved Charlie and Lola.  It's just perfect as a transitional step into story lines.  Both Charlie and Lola are lovable, silly, believable characters, and watchers of all ages get addicted quickly to the stories.  I love watching them over and over as much as the kids do!",1373155200,,297,4.784313725490196

3478706,4,B001B187O8,I bought this for my daughters for Easter.. One is 7 and the other is 19months. Both of them love it! I love it better than any American Kid Show or cartoon! I low how they use there imagination! Something that a lot of cartoons don't use! I would have given 5starts but it's not the compleat set.. I had to buy the 3rd season DVDs 9/10/11. If all were there I I would 10STARS!!! So order it and enjoy it with your children!!!,1366848000,,426,4.083333333333333
3478707,5,B001B187O8,My autistic daughter loves to watch Charlie and Lola  on the kids channels on the tv. Now she can watch them any time,1366761600,,117,4.086956521739131

3478710,5,B001B187O8,"Actually, my grandkids of various ages--4, 8 and 10--love Charlie and Lola and so do I. It took us quite a number of visits to view all of the volumes, and I was disappointed that one of the discs was damaged and didn't work. I'm easily frustrated by returning things and never keep receipts; so I'd suggest you buy this series, but keep yours and view soon after receiving.",1356825600,,374,4.434782608695652
3478711,5,B001B187O8,Great Product....Whole family loved it!  What more can I say except a fantastic set and well packaged when arrived.  Great!,1356652800,,123,5.1
3478712,5,B001B187O8,"This is by far the greatest childrens program ever recorded.  The music is stunning, the illustrations are whimsical, the characters are loveable, and the story lines are relevent.  My kids were hooked by the time they were 3, and now, 5 years later they still giggle to these adorable stories.  The best money I ever spent on a DVD...wishing they would produce an audio soundtrack CD so my daughter could use the music for her skating routine!  Please! And thank-you!",1349136000,,468,4.8125

3478735,5,B001B187O8,"These are the cutest DVD's.  The main characters are British siblings.  They have adorable accents and sayings and they are the only DVD we can watch over and over and over again without driving me crazy.  The brother is older and is very nurturing.  The siblings have a sweet relationship based on teamwork, respect and communication.  It's a much better alternative to the bratty and destructive character's on most other kids cartoons. They hold my 2 year old's attention and my 10 year old nephews too.  Great purchase.",1326412800,,523,4.886363636363637
3478736,5,B001B187O8,"I got the kiddo's watching this on Disney a few years ago and when I came across the DVD's I just had to get them. Well they spent the rest of the week watching them, again and again. They are very educational and very tricky in how they add the education in there. They are there to help children understand morals although they are not preachy. Some have a point, some are just for fun, and that makes them perfect.

Charlie and Lola are highly recommended for your children, or even the child in you because they are that enjoyable.

But Charlie!!!",1325635200,,551,4.392156862745098
3478737,5,B001B187O8,One of the few shows I will let my children watch. The children can relate well to Charlie and Lola and the grammar is terrific. My husband and I do not allow our kids to watch very many shows due to the poor language and not knowing what the characters are. This show is the best I have seen in a long time and my kids love it! It makes me laugh as well!,1322438400,,355,3.810810810810811
3478738,5,B001B187O8,"I purchased this set for my two daughters (2 & 4) and we've had them for almost a month now ... i don't think a day has gone by where they don't ask to watch charlie and ""lula"" ;  Needless to say they have become an obsession  and a favorite for all of us!  i wish more shows were like this!  It teaches our kids the values on treat someone the way you would want to be treated, loving your imagination, and creativity!  Beautiful!  We love love you charlie and lola!!!  Best money spent on a dvds by far!",1317081600,,505,4.040404040404041

3478740,5,B001B187O8,"My son missed watching the show on the Disney channel.  I had brought one video previously from a store. He becamed tired of wathching those episodes.  For his birthday, I looked around and found this set on Amazon. He was overjoyed with the variety of episodes on the videos.  I was happy with the price.  A lot of the episodes were new to us.  This is a nice bargain.",1310083200,,369,4.2898550724637685
3478741,5,B001B187O8,"My two daughters, wife and I love Charlie and Lola...

""Charlie and Lola"" takes the perspective of the 5 year-old Lola on casual/ day-to-day episodes, taking the opportunity to teach valuable & fun lessons to our kids (it was helpful a couple of times, watch the one in which Lola almost ruins her brother birthday and you will understand me).

I love how Lola day-dreams about everything, and how the cartoon makes those dreams alive. That must be how my daughter's brain function now... at least I hope so...

Also, ""Charlie and Lola"" highlights the difference between brother/sister vs. friends relationships in a tender way.

Each episode lasts about 10 minutes, which proves to be enough to explore a situation in full and come to a comforting end, yet not long enough to lose the little ones focus.

Not repetitive (like Dora), not foolish (like blues clues), not violent, not annoying.

Enjoy... kids grow fast!",1307750400,,918,4.890322580645162
3478742,5,B001B187O8,"The Charlie and Lola series is so beneficial. The brother-sister duo and their friends deal with real challenges in a productive and respectful manner. This set cost $5/movie, regularly 9.99 - 14.99 per dvd. Well worth the mula. I want my sons to watch Charlie and Lola shows (and read the books) as long as possible...I know they are educational. But they are very entertaining, both to them and to my husband and I. We always get lots of chuckles, what creative people are producing this show!",1304380800,,495,4.7011494252873565
3478743,4,B001B187O8,"I'm from the UK and my 4yr daughter loves charlie and lola. We had all their DVD's but they were the wrong region for us as now we live in Florida. Last year i was looking for the dvds like this but could't find any. Now i've found these, she watches them all the time and gives me some peace and quiet!

They come in the cases and the jacket as pictured, which is also great because that way she can keep them all neat.

There are a few DVD's missing, in the sense of it only goes up to 8 and i know that there are 12, so i suppose we're meant to buy those separately, that was a bit annoying. But this is still a really good price for the amount of dvd's",1301788800,,656,3.8518518518518516
3478773,5,B001B187O8,"These programs are so fantastic. They are non-violent.  The children are very kind, say please and thank you.  They do have conflicts and are worked out in very creative ways.  The Christmas episode actually says, ""Baby Jesus"" and they sing the song ""Away in a Manger"". I really appreciated that since I do believe in Jesus and celebrate his birthday as Christmas day. It's refreshing to find the true meaning recognized in a childrens show, where American's are so afraid to mention Jesus on his birthday, he's been all but removed, it's ridiculous.  I am very happy with these videos, and would recommend them to any parent looking for quality programming that you do not have to worry about what your child is watching.",1301529600,,722,4.798387096774194
3478774,5,B001B187O8,Very nice I'm 32 but I love this cartoons and want my kids if I have in the future to enjoy them. I plan to lend them to my friends kids they love the books I bet they will love the videos too.,1300406400,,193,3.511627906976744
3478775,5,B001B187O8,"This is a lovely TV series for children and adults alike. My 3 and 9 years old daughters like very much. Lola is an usual 5 years old girl, however Charlie, her brother, to my eyes, is a kind of a little genius, a very patient and wise boy, an enlightened soul that make a delight to watch each episode.",1298937600,,303,4.066666666666666
3478776,5,B001B187O8,No more being on a waiting list at the library for our grandson.  His favorite show! No expensive cable service required.,1295827200,,121,4.761904761904762
3478777,5,B001B187O8,"I'm 29 and I watch this show with my 17 year old sister.  It is absolutely wonderful.  We laugh so much at the quaintness of the characters and their quirks.  The stories are very well written and have a positive message that if taken in by all kids, would benefit them, their parents, siblings, and society.  This is all done intelligently and without patronizing kids.

My other favorite shows are The Simpsons, Futurama, Arrested Development, and Lost.  But this is the only one I can see trying to make my future kids watch.",1285286400,11,528,4.623655913978495
3478778,5,B001B187O8,"I absolutely completely adore Charlie and Lola.  All forms, but particularly the videos.  It's hard for me to watch some kids' shows as I find them either boring, visually unappealing, or just plain obnoxious.  Charlie and Lola are the antidote to all of that being intelligent, funny, and very nice to look at with a vibrant color palate and multi media mode.  Charlie and Lola, Volumes 1-8 is a necessity for anyone with children.

The set includes eight DVDs, with some favorites like, I Will Not Ever Never Eat A Tomato, Snow Is My Favorite and My Best, and Look After Your Planet.  The stories set a great tone for compassionate living and Charlie and Lola are wonderful role models for kids.  They work out their problems amicably, they are respectful (without being corny), they are fun, smart and eco conscious.

They're also English so there are subtle British charms throughout, like having biscuits instead of cookies.  Charlie is the big brother everyone wishes they had and Lola is a delightful, self possessed, confident little girl.  Imagination reigns in the world of Charlie and Lola and it's a feast that you just don't find in other children's shows.

My son started watching Charlie and Lola when he was about one, and at five he still appreciates them.  I love cuddling up on the couch and watching this show together, I can't tell you how many times I've seen each episode and somehow they are still fresh for me.  I dread the day when he outgrows them because I know I never will.  Great for summer days when kids need chill time, for airplane rides and waiting rooms.  Highly recommended.",1277942400,,1612,4.727598566308243
3478779,5,B001B187O8,These DVDs arrived right on time for Christmas though I ordered a little late. They were perfect. Not a problem at all and they were a hit with my granddaughter.,1265587200,,161,4.4
3478780,5,B001B187O8,"I purchased this set for my grandson for his second birthday, and could not be happier with it. He loves the videos and it's good clean entertainment for traveling. I was happy to find the entire  set for such a decent price, after looking online and finding one here, one there, etc... The set was brand new complete with shrink wrap, and was delivered within 2 or 3 days.  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone with small children who want clean wholesome and educational entertainment for their youngsters.",1265414400,,555,4.770833333333333
3478781,5,B001B187O8,"My son is 3 and he just loves these sweet, family oriented stories about a young girl who is looked after by her older brother. Beautiful stories that weave themes of using your imagination, family and life lessons.",1264032000,,215,4.684210526315789
3478782,5,B001B187O8,"Okay, so I loved Charlie and Lola the first time we flipped on Disney for Baby Jane, but if it's possible, I have fallen further in love with this show since I bought the first two seasons in boxed set.  Here's why:

***The children are thoughtful and kind to one another (no bratty sass);
***Charlie and Lola are loving brother and sister in an age where siblings are rivals;
***They work through their problems together;
***They use their imaginations, in fact, the show's foundation is based on using the imagination;
***The kids are adorable, realistic to their ages, and have wonderful senses of humor.

16-month old Baby Jane watches an episode before bedtime with a big grin and smiling eyes, and I feel good about what she's absorbing. Heck, it's even soothing to have on in the background while I'm doing dishes. We've watched through volume five, and so far picture and sound quality has been excellent. I'll be watching this show when I'm fifty, it brings such a good feeling of love and humor into our home.

We are very picky, don't allow TV, but do let our 2 and 7 year old girls watch these (especially on long car trips!) and they love them.  They rank right up there with ""Andy Pandy"" and ""Harold and the Purple Crayon.""",1258588800,5,336,4.677966101694915
3478795,1,B001B187O8,"I know I'm in the minority, as most people seem to love Charlie and Lola. But when my child watches these show, she only comes away with the negative aspects of it.

Every show seems to be structured with Lola anxious, worried or complaining about something. As her older brother Charlie attempts to reassure her, she continues to repeat whatever is her negative mantra of that show. Of course at the end of each show, whatever Lola's worry or complaint was is shown to be resolved or unnecessary, but we have consistently found that our 4 year old only picks up on the message that was stated repeatedly throughout the show by Lola, not the positive message at the end.

Maybe if your child is anxious or worries by nature, these would be beneficial. But my child isn't. However as a 4 year old with an active imagination who likes to act out her videos and stories, she will ""adopt"" the Lola persona, and the negative messages and way of talking that Lola expresses.

Of all the children's programs I have seen, this is the only one I've encountered that I actively dislike. Mainly I wanted to write this review for anyone thinking of buying these without having seen them, to explain the show format so buyers could make an informed decision.",1257897600,14,1245,4.599099099099099
