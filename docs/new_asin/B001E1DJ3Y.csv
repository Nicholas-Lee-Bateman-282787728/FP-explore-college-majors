8296010,5,B001E1DJ3Y,"If you were a fan of Cynthia Gregory's and Fernando Bujones' partnership, you won't want to miss this.  The first half of the video takes you through a run through of their most popular pas de deux, complete with sweat and exhaustion.  The second half is the complete third act of Coppelia. The bonus interview with Ms. Gregory is very informative.  A completely enjoyable way to spend an evening with your favorite dancers.",1322179200,6,424,4.780821917808219
