I love the Music they play and would love to get my hands on the songs they play and sing. This has got to be one of the Greatest Christmas Movies ever made. The Character's Scott Bakula and Cynthia Nixon play are so realistic, so believable. The Girl that plays the Deaf Daughter is great too.. The rest of the Children are also really good in this Movie and so is the Mother-in-law. I have a DVR this year so I recorded it and have watched it 2 or 3 times already this Christmas. I Love this Movie.. Penny",1325116800,3,610,4.1344537815126055

It beautifully covers the stages of grieving that people experience after losing a loved one, also showing what the power of love can do to sustain them towards acceptance.  I'm sorry that this film is hard to find...it should be an annual movie for all families!!!",1228694400,6,430,4.631578947368421

Scott Bakula and Cynthia Nixon give moving performances as Grins and Sharon Jenkins, a depression-era family living in deep Appalachia with their 4 children.  Nixon expecially is ethereal as the dying wife and mother.  She makes you really believe in her character.
Veteran-actor Eva Marie Saint does a tremendous job with her supporting portrayal of the mother of Grins.  Her ""granny"" is tough, resilient and gruffly tender.  She also has the ""sight""- which plays a role in the movie.
The children were all well-cast, especially the mute daughter, and the oldest son, who tries hard to be the man of the family when he feels his father is letting go of his responsibilities to the family.
This story had me alternately weeping and smiling, although it was in no way saccharine sweet or maudlin.
The only thing I felt kept it from being more of a ""family"" movie was the degree of mild profanity sprinkled throughout.  It was totally unnecessary and a disappointment in what was otherwise a wonderful holiday movie.
It's also a beautifully filmed movie, with the log cabin and surrounding mountain vistas giving warmth and character to the storyline as much as the actors themselves.  The music was very appropriate for the time period and location, and I enjoyed hearing the old folksongs.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies of love, suffering and courage.  It's on my wish-list already!",1046822400,23,1607,5.015037593984962
7968272,5,B00006G8NI,"If there ever was a movie to make you believe in miracles, then this is your movie.  Scott Bakula is very believable father who goes from carefree and funloving to serious and depressed - with such ease that you forget he is the Captain in Enterprise.",1027555200,16,251,4.456521739130435
