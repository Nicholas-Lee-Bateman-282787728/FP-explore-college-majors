8219573,5,6304065264,"Homeroom Affairs 2 continues the plot from Part 1 and maintains the same style and pacing.  Tokiro Ehara (the teacher) and Miyako (the high school girl) continue their ""relationship"" with plenty of humour.  Introduced to the plot is Miyako's former rough boyfriend and we see how Tokiro stands up for Miyako.
The video uses innuendo and fan service liberally but very carefully in order to maintain a tightly scripted plot as it did in Part 1. This is genuinely a tastefully done video with a nice ending.  There is no sex between Tokiro and Miyako.  The video quality is bright, stable, and is happily one of those ""perfect"" VHS transfers.
The video is based on characters that originally appeared as the series ""Tanin no Kankei"" by Ichiro Arima. It appeared in Young Animal Magazine around 1993 and 1994. There are two much more detailed individual manga from that time period with a number of other humourous plots into which Miyako manages to tease Tokiro immensely. You may also find more references to this show on the web if you search for ""Tanin no Kankei"" instead of Homeroom Affairs.
There is a manga translation project ongoing for the manga version, so you might look for that if you want to follow up on the continuing plotline covered in these two OAV videos.  At present, there is no DVD version announced, but hopefully, it will be picked up.",1016150400,,1358,4.737288135593221
