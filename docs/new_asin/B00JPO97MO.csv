6388469,3,B00JPO97MO,"Christ's parabola about love, the Prodigal Son, is perhaps one of the best known in the Bible and has been adapted many times. This newer version reminds us once again how much we have to learn about God's love for His children. A Long Way Off is the modern day version of the prodigal son.

Jake is the youngest of the two Abraham's sons. A bright albeit superficial young man, Jake is his father's favourite whilst his hardworking brother is his father's right hand.
As expected the story unfolds with Jake wishing to leave the farm for greener pastures and his father's acquiescing to his son's demands for his inheritance. Just there, I felt like grinding my teeth! Is this young man for real?

But there would be no story for us to unravel if it did not follows what the Bible tells us. Jake gets to have a taste of the good life until he loses it all and returns home to beg his father's love and forgiveness.
As much as I do not like Jake's character (I much prefer the steadfastness of the older brother) I must differ to the lesson it carries: God's everlasting love for us!

Running 105 minutes, the concept of the script is pleasant enough, the acting a little stale and not very realistic.

3 Stars!

6388470,5,B00JPO97MO,"A Long Way Off is a fantastic DVD.  It is a modern day story of the prodigal son. I really love this story anyway it is told. Since it is the prodigal son story you know how it ends, but each telling is different.
  The main character Jake thinks he knows it all and wants to be rid of his father and brother and the farm. He wants to have a life of his own. So he leaves for the city and invests in many things and he has it all.  All  of the girls, cars, houses and money anyone could want, until it all comes crashing down.
  Jake has no money, no friends and nothing. He meets someone down and out who works on a farm and he helps Jake to come to the truth that he needs to go home.
  My favorite part of the movie is when Jake goes home and his father meets him on the lane to his farm. It was an emotional part and very tender. Just to see the love and hope born anew.
  I think this modern  version is really incredible. I believe A Long Way Off is a DVD you need to have. I highly recommend it and know you, your family and friends will love it.

6388471,4,B00JPO97MO,"The story of the Prodigal Son is one of the most well known in the Bible and has been re-told in many different ways. A Long Way Off the movie is a modern version of the beloved story.

It's interesting watching a movie where you basically know the story and how it will all end. It does take away a little suspense but it's still intriguing to see how it will be interpreted and played out.

In this particular story the prodigal son is Jake Abraham. He has spent his young adult life working for his Father's farming business but it's not where his heart is. He dreams of faraway places and a more exciting life. His discontent for his life is evident from the beginning as is his Father's unconditional love for him.

He brazenly asks his father for his inheritance so he can set out on his own and life out his big dreams. As the Bible story goes, he lives it up for a while getting a new fancy car, condo and spending hours partying and living it up. He meets women, some good and some bad and the battle between good and evil plays out.

Jason Burkey of October Baby is the son and does a marvelous job of playing the prodigal. His Dad, John Diehl of Stargate seemed a little too soft-spoken and slow in this roll but he still gets the message of grace, love and forgiveness across. I just feel a little got lost in his interpretation.

This image on the cover of the DVD is my favorite moment of the movie when his father sees him coming home from a distance. The white picket fences and beautiful scenery really bring home the iconic moment.

The story is very Biblically accurate as far as the main points go, just with modern day variations.

The story is loved by many and re-told so often because we all want that grace and unconditional love that our heavenly father can give as as represented by the earthly father in this story.  A Long Way Off was a modern interpretation of this that will make it relatable for today's generation.",1409184000,12,1947,4.34435261707989
6388472,4,B00JPO97MO,"Looking for a modern day retelling of the prodigal son? Then you just might want to take a look at Word Films newest DVD, A Long Way Off. It begins with the Abraham family who is in the farming business that employs two sons, Seth (DAVE BLAMY/Army Wives), the eldest and Jake (JASON BURKEY/October Baby), the youngest. Seth understands that hard work is required in order to make a family farm successful even in tough economic times. He is the one that has stayed behind to help his father out, while Jake left to seek a higher education in college. Even though Jake returns, his heart isn't interested in farming any longer. He believes he is wasting his college talent trying to update the farming business.

His lack of responsibility is apparent to everyone, when Jake shows up late and updates the invoicing system against his fathers wishes, costing them more than just a loss of business. No matter how hard Jake tries, he wants out and if his father won't support him, he will quit and find another way. But like the father in the biblical sense, Mr. Abraham (JOHN DIEHL/Stargate) gives Jake his inheritance to find a life that suits him better. Armed with more money than he knows what to do with, Jake leaves his family behind in attempts to prove them all wrong and become a successful businessman and financial consultant. But the world is a big place filled with people who are just as selfish as Jake and will stop at nothing to ensure that they make as much money off of Jake as they can when they see his financial investments are paying off. But life isn't about to turn out like Jake wanted and soon he will bite off more than he can chew.

I received A Long Way Off compliments of Word Films and Edify Media Inc for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. While this DVD is Dove Foundation Approved, I would caution parents that this might not be suitable for the entire family. There are parts of the movie where Jake encounters Laura, an up and coming actress who wants Jake to invest in her upcoming movie and promises him ""anything"" for his financing. There is considerable drinking, hard partying, and the impression that Jake's relationship with Laura questionable who seduces him to get what she wants. Parental guidance is suggested, although it does portray a modern day retelling of the prodigal son who rises to the top only to lose it all in the end. I would rate this one a 4 out of 5 stars and the lesson you take away from this one is timeless and that a family's love is always unconditional.

6388481,4,B00JPO97MO,"How many ways can a person tell the stories recorded in the Bible without taking away from the truths expressed for our growth? How many times can a child, or family, hear age-old tales without growing tired of listening?
People who love the Bible, believe in its truths, and adhere to its teachings, probably would say the stories brilliance never grows dim. They always enjoy them and often are surprised by nuggets they find that they hadnt realized were there before.
For me, its always fun to see how someone adapts Biblical stories into modern-day accounts. So when A Long Way Off was delivered to my mailbox, I was excited to watch it.
The story is a modern-day telling of the Prodigal Son, a parable told by Jesus, about a son who obtained then squandered his wealth. Humbled, he returned home to, hopefully, be hired as one of his fathers servants. If you are familiar with this story in the Bible, you're also aware of how this story ends. For this film, however, I enjoyed seeing the sons journey. His attitude, his pride, his inability to face the truth long before hitting bottom, all are terrific portrayals of what Jesus may have wanted us to see; and while the ending was predictable due to its connection with the familiar story told us since Sunday school, there was an added twistor creative license, if you willthat I appreciated.
I didn't get the sense that this overtly Christian film was in your face with platitudes and formulas; but instead, it was an honest look at family dynamics, true friendship, humility, and that you really can go home, if the home you're heading to is into the embrace of Jesus. This film is one that my family can enjoy without having to hold the fast-forward button ready for those scenes you didn't expect upon the first viewing.

*NOTE: this film was offered free of charge with the understanding that I would provide an honest review.",1410480000,29,1889,4.6897590361445785
6388482,3,B00JPO97MO,"A Long Way Off quickly establishes its characters and story in a way that feels natural while making it evident that this is a retelling of the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Jason Burkey (October Baby) convincingly portrays impatient, self-centered Jake who bristles under authority and thinks newer is better. Hes so lazy that he steals his brother Seths lunch out of the refrigerator to avoid making his own. And hes so headstrong and cocky that when he prepares to leave home with his share of the inheritance, you're only inches away from muttering good riddance under your breath, as you imagine Seth might. But thanks to a quietly insistent performance from John Diehl as Jakes father Abraham, you try to see Jake through a more loving lens.

As a parting gift, Abraham gives Jake a watch that belonged to his grandfather. Its timeworn so it holds little more than sentimental value, but its still in perfect working order. Notably, the first extravagance Jake procures when he reaches the big city is a lavish watch. Its time he holds in low regard, thinking that he can quickly earn more wealth and increase his inheritance, thereby proving his own worth and disproving his fathers time-honored ways. Little details like this are where the film excels  showing rather than telling us how Jake finds more value in material wealth than family.

Another strength worth mentioning is the creative insertion of voices  on his truck radio as hes driving away from home, on the television news channels in his hotel suite, and even on the book jackets at a book fair Jake attends with Summer, a friendly barista from the local coffee shop  that serve as morality, or the voice of God, warning of the emptiness and deceit of temptation, wealth, and sin. On his drive, Jake flips the channels mindlessly until he hears something a little more hedonistic. In his hotel suite, it appears hes somewhat more willing to listen, though hes still clearly convinced that he cant lose.

Ill admit that I lost engagement somewhere in the middle. If the film has a weakness, its that it so faithfully brings the parable to life that we can predict the outcome. Side plots like Jakes relationship with Summer don't have room to grow, in large part because they are additions to the original narrative. Its hard to watch someone implode, and because we know how the story ends, we spend much of the film waiting for everything to blow up in Jakes face. And when it does, hes quickly destitute, hungry, and homeless. Then, just like the Prodigal Son in the biblical account in Luke, Jake ends up working on a pig farm. While in the bible the prodigal comes to his senses and independently realizes its time to go home, Jake gets a helpful nudge from a fellow homeless man and pig farmer named Al.

The story of the prodigal has always been as much about the father as the son. The film is no different. If you are left wanting anything, it would be this: to know more about this loving, patient father who irregardless of his sons squandering of his wealth, not only joyfully and gracefully welcomes his home, but openly celebrates him before the world with a party and a feast! The film awakened my curiosity about Jakes loving father, and since its based on a parable which illustrates our Heavenly Fathers merciful love for us, sinners and saints alike, it ultimately leads back to God. In that, the film is a resounding success.

Verdict: 3.5 of 5 Hearts. A Successful Modern Adaptation of the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Though not without flaws, A Long Way Off succeeds in reaching its predicted conclusion in a way that touches and inspires. John Diehl shines in his understated portrayal of Abraham, a patient and loving father who moves beyond mere forgiveness to lavishly celebrate his undeserving son.
