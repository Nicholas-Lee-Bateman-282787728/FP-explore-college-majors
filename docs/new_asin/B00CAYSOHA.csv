5710793,5,B00CAYSOHA,"I loved this event!!! I saw a side to David I did not expect, he's kinda silly. And Emily is even more beautiful in person than on the show.
I am so enamored I watch three and four reruns of the show in succession that air almost daily. I can't get enough!!
And I am very happy to hear they're going to explore the past personal issues with Sweets, as well as the other members. And can I say, hes grown into quite a stud!
This special really gave insight as to the inner workings of my favorite show. I cant wait for the next edition

And finally, the video quality was outstanding!!!!! I felt like I was there in the auditorium.",1366243200,8,630,4.163934426229508

5710807,3,B00CAYSOHA,"Fun to hear cast off set.  Kind of funny, seems like there is some animosity between a few cast members.  Some personalities are just like the tv character.",1441324800,,156,4.535714285714286

5710813,4,B00CAYSOHA,Why was Tamara Taylor not part on the PALEYFEST? I enjoy the show but it have become a little flat so I hope you spice it up by maybe getting Michaela Conlin and or Patricia Belcher into some type of trouble. You have used most of the cast.,1427846400,,240,4.020833333333333

5710834,4,B00CAYSOHA,"If you like the cast of Bones, this is what you want to watch.  It is funny, entertaining, and give you a slight look into the life on the set of Bones.  It also shows you how actually entertaining these players are.",1399248000,,216,4.119047619047619
5710835,4,B00CAYSOHA,"PaleyFest is a fun event and I've been to several of them in person.  This is the real deal and the cast members and audience mingle afterwards.  This is a great group and I was particularly engaged by TJ Thyne, who seems as genuine and fun as his character.  I know someone who taught both Emily and her sister at Crossroads and has nothing but positive things to say about them.  A really nice conversation with some very comfortable people.",1399161600,,443,4.5

5710838,5,B00CAYSOHA,"If you want to get a taste of the personalities who are behind the creation of Bones, I highly recommend the Paleyfest.  The humorous insights and personal opinions of Bones' actors, directors and writers gives you a window into the creation and growth of the show.  I also love the spontantiy ""Booth"" uses to engage the audiance.  It leaves you wanting more and hoping for a season 11!!!",1395187200,,388,4.676470588235294

5710842,5,B00CAYSOHA,"Although I can't watch this show any more (I cancelled my tv cable)  I am going to say that this group was THE most satisfying  - next to the NICS group, because the show IS my favorite - BUT !  I am very disappointed that no one asked (or had a chance to ask) about an early episode where everyone was depressed - especially Brennan - and Angela, brilliant darling that she is, created an holographic Christmas Tree on the machine that is/was supposed to used to recreate bodies from bones (an identification tool, I believe).

IF there was anyone in the audience who was going to ask that question, and did not get a chance, I both applaud and pity you.  THAT was one of my favorite scenes in an episode I WAS able to watch (while I could still afford cable!)...  It isn't that I'm ""all about Christmas"" at all - but that was one of the coolest things I've seen on tv in a long time... (of course, now I've dropped way behind and watch online...)

Respectfully submitted to the writer who wrote Angelia doing the holographic tree !",1385251200,,1033,4.348958333333333
5710843,5,B00CAYSOHA,I finally felt like I was able to MEET the actors and the characters of the series.  Loved it!  Wish it had lasted longer!  Wish there had been more of each actor.  Some didn't have enough spotlight.,1384905600,,199,4.297297297297297
8579502,5,B00CAYSOHA,was awesome seeing how these people are in real life not on the show of bones didn't have time to watch the whole thing but will as soon as i can,1486684800,,145,3.7096774193548385
8579503,4,B00CAYSOHA,"Other than it was hard to hear all the comments and responses, it was fun to see the actors/directors interact with each other outside of their roles on Bones.",1486598400,,159,4.517241379310345
8579504,5,B00CAYSOHA,Very entertaining.,1486598400,,18,8.5
8579505,5,B00CAYSOHA,"I enjoy watching Bones love the staff and choices for staff after one leaves,and stories.",1478649600,,89,5.0
8579506,5,B00CAYSOHA,"It's a great show I only wish they would continue on with more seasons ,only a handful of shows in the history of shows are this well written or acted ..If Gray's Anatomy can do it, Bone's can easily.",1472860800,,200,4.153846153846154

8579509,4,B00CAYSOHA,"Mr. Boreanaz
Bring Ms. Conlin to you next trek to Park City.
Evidently you come every year, I don't hang around at the bars so seeing her or you is slim to none !",1468886400,,162,3.7941176470588234
