Ironically a movie that's just short of being porn, also has a plot that involves the mind and psychology.  Brian's character, Edward, was a scientist working on memory/mind/souls transference.  His early experiments were on the corpses of criminals.  One experiment left him with the memories from a serial killer, named Travis.  Part of Travis's diseased mind was fused with Edward's.

Eventually Edward is given unlimited funding by an elderly millionaire - Everett Longstreet. This movie graphically demonstrated Longstreet's horror of being old. How he believed he'd wasted his life, and was desperate for More Life.  Longstreet had pursued research similar to Edward's, but had never cracked it.  Together they succeeded.  Then Longstreet double crossed Edward.  Longstreet successfully switched bodies with Edward, but Longstreet hadn't known about Travis.

Edward was a peaceful man, and a healer.  The memories from Travis were separate from him.  He couldn't control them, but they didn't control him either.  Longstreet however had been ready to murder Edward, after the body switch.  Longstreet was a killer, Travis's memories were compatible with Longstreet's.  Longstreet was losing himself to the urge to Kill.

The climax has Longstreet holding Britt hostage, using her to force Edward to cleanse Travis from his mind.  Edward's priorities were to protect Britt and prevent Travis's evil from being completely unleashed.  With Britt's help Edward outwits Longstreet and regain his body.",1317081600,,1712,5.536679536679537
8095465,3,B000C3L2D4,"Britt (Pamela Anderson) is a talented sculpturess who is on the verge of making her mark on the artistic community. However her achievements go unnoticed by her scientist/boyfriend Edward (Brian Krausse) who is busy attempting to record the thoughts and memories locked away in the human mind.

As their relationship deteriorates Edward is contacted by Longstreet (David Warner) who offers his finanical assistance to the research project. Unfortunately the aging and crippled Longstreet's true intention is not to simply record the thoughts and memories of others, he plans to transfer his mental processes into the younger, athletic body of the unsuspecting Edward. Thus taking over his life, his work and his girlfriend.

Pamela Anderson starred, or co-starred in four films between '93 and '95. They are; Raw Justice ('93), Snapdragon ('93), Naked Souls ('95) and Barb Wire ('96). Everyone pretty much knows what to expect from her movies, silly plot, poor production values, mostly unknowns except for herself and lots of Pamela in various stages of undress. Of course if you've seen all four of these movies you are obviously a fan of this buxom blonde and could care less about the first three expectations mentioned above.

'Naked Souls' is in my opinion the best of the bunch. Pamela has never looked better and she actually does attempt to do some real acting in this film. For any women in the audience there's Brian Krausse from the popular 'Charmed' television series to occupy your time so everybody's happy.",1137628800,10,1522,5.129032258064516
