138525,3,0792834976,"In the grand tradition of fight now, ask questions later, comes Road House.  Patrick Swayze is Dalton.  He is the new breed of bar bouncers.  Calling himself the cooler, Dalton is small, a martial arts expert, and he has a degree in psychology.  This means bad news for the regulars at the Duece, Duece because Dalton has been hired to clean it up.  And clean it up he does.  But first he had to personally put every piece of bad element he doesn't want out on their rear ends.  Everything seems to be going right until Dalton runs head to head with Brad Wesley(Ben Gazzera).  Wesley is like the town's dictator, he owns a piece of just about every business in town and he doesn't like Dalton's presence one bit.  Lucky for the audience one of them must go and Dalton isn't one to budge easily.
This is a guys movie all the way.  Swayze is awesome as Dalton.  He is cool, confident, and tough as nails. Gazzera is good as the villian and he sends plenty of thugs over to the Duece, Duece to keep the action coming.  Sam Elliot is great in his supporting role as Dalton's mentor, Wade Garrett.  And of course there has to be women, and there are, but none hotter than Kelly Lynch, Dalton's love interest.  Roadhouse never slows down.  It has a great soundtrack and it is well directed.  It's just a fun movie.",974246400,11,1308,4.365145228215767
138526,5,0792834976,If you like a film with behind kicking contests this is your movie. Add in the blonde with brains and you nearly have a plot.  Patrick Swayse plays  the role of the best bouncer in the busi- ness. He is brought to town  because a dance hall is having problems with rowdies. Sam Elliott plays the  role of an aging bouncer very well. You even have former wrestling champion  Terry Funk as a bad guy. Ben Gazarra is the ringleader of the local bad  guys who owns the town. Swayse whips all of Gazarra's toughs. The villain  then has to recruit some new talent in the form of an ex- convict who whips  most of Swayze's fellow bodyguards. He and Swayze have a showdown which  Swayze finally wins. Swayze and the people of the town finally rebel on Ben  Gazarra and his forces of evil and restore order to the city. If you are  looking for a serious movie forget this. If you want to see some  entertaining combat you have found your movie. All in all entertaining.,967680000,5,960,4.331460674157303
138527,3,0792834976,"Patrick Swayze plays a maverick martial arts expert with an NYU philosophy degree who cleans up a small-town bar full of rednecks. This is another so-bad-it's-good movie.

138533,5,0792834976,"ROAD HOUSE"" This is THE iconic cult classic movie that won 4 Oscars in 1989.  Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott are at their heroic kickass best.  The great supporting cast headed by a sadistic Ben Gazzara as the tyrannical smug landowner is perfect; as is Kevin Tighe's white-haired dignified club owner, and the smartly sexy Kelly Lynch.  Add a motley group of bar dwellers that can never again be duplicated, and you have a vintage action-packed epic movie. The theme of vigilante justice is always highly entertaining and sweet.  Nevertheless, it leaves a bitter aftertaste when we reflect on the aftermath and legacy of revenge. The dead friend is still dead.  Killing the killers just added more dead bodies.  And after all these centuries, it begs the question,,, Is humanity any nearer to evolving into a more humane species?  This movie sadly answers that question with a loud and resounding..Hell No!!!.",1522627200,,910,4.986754966887418

138537,1,0792834976,"I think this movie killed Patrick Swayze. Now, I know by making such a claim that I'm sure to anger a lot of folks. After all, how can a movie kill someone? How can a movie do anything at all? Well I'd agree with you and my evidence is purely based on circumstantial evidences based upon my own viewing of this movie.

When I first watched this movie it was during a time when I got a gag blood pressure gift. There was a time in history when home blood pressure just came out and people were really digging into it. I got one as a gag gift and my blood pressure was perfectly at 110/75. Now what does a blood pressure gift have to do with this movie? Well while watching the film I suddenly found myself extremely irritable and sweating profusely. A family member became concerned when I started to scream profanity and dripping sweat. They got the blood pressure kit and put it in my arm and it came back 180/95. They became very concerned and I went to the ER. Being away from the movie for just 15 minutes I was starting to relax. The doctors were very concerned having never seen something like that and told me to stay away from watching this movie.

Now, I believe Patrick may have recollected starring in this film and eventually developed into cancer. After all he made this movie and he had to live with the pain.

You may ask what is particularly wrong with this movie? How can this movie anger someone to the point of a near heart attack or fatal cancer? The plot of the movie seems alright. It's about a high end bouncer going into a small town to take care of a problematic bar whose patrons break out in regular fights and property damages. The owner want to have a nice clean bar so he hired a high end bouncer. Oh yeah, Patrick is a very tough guy who is also very rich but like to live the simple lift. He settles renting out a barn and helping out in the farm during his off time from the bar.

So that doesn't sound too bad. A bit unbelievable but after all this is just a movie, right? Supposed to be a fantasy, right? Well the problem with this movie is how everyone carries on themselves. The mannerism of the actors and actresses just infuriating. Patrick is supposed to be a super chill dude. He's very relaxed and always laughing and chuckling. Even when there are things smashing, breaking, blowing up all around him. We see everyone super chill while everything is just going crazy all around them. The way everyone is sitting around like they're old timers with fancy stories of past antics where something so seriously profound happened but they're just super chill about it. Oh yeah, a fat guy is always getting punched and rolling on the ground, but everyone is just super chill about it all laughing and joking while some fat guy is on the ground. All the bar workers are super chill too talking stories and being super chill while people grope them or try to kill them. Just laughing while there's a huge fight breaking out like, ""haha, don't worry I'm going to take my 15 minutes break here soon."" There's a blind man walking singing songs and laughing behind a chain link fence that's constantly bombarded with broken beer bottles and other things. But he's cool about it like, ""Man I got my songs and I'm going to entertain y'all."" Then everyone is just breaking out into fights, a fat guy is on the ground dead, and everyone is just laughing and super chill about it.

At the end of the movie there's dead bodies all over the place, fat guy crushed by a bear, and the police comes by all laughing and joking. Don't forget Patrick constantly gets into brawls and he goes to the ER. He doesn't want any shots but he's super chill while he get stitched up and he even got a date with the hot young doctor who turns out to be super chill. Like what a great first date at the bar where everyone gets into huge brawls and a Patrick's long time friend comes by to tell stories about other brawls and showing scars he got from it. Everyone is laughing and super chill about it and Patrick's hot date is falling for him because of his super chill stories of past brawls.

Overall I don't recommend this movie unless you want to get a heart attack. This is quite possibly the only movie that infuriates me.",1521936000,,4234,4.366751269035533

But when he's hired to clean up the Double Deuce in the small town of Jasper, he's pushed to his breaking point. Turns out Jasper is controlled by an evil sadist (Ben Gazzara) who doesn't want anyone meddling with his town. After he sends his goons to bust up the Double Deuce, all hell breaks loose.

138626,4,0792834976,"My ultimate pick of the awesome/ridiculous action movies of the 80's. Road House is literally about Patrick Swayze's bouncer Dalton (exuding bad boy cool) being hired to clean up a rough small town bar. Using his classic mantra of ""be nice... until it is time to not be nice"" Dalton manages to clean out the crooked and thuggish employees and turn the bar around into a quality establishment. Unfortunately, a local land owner just hates this for various reasons and decides to run Dalton out of town. That's basically it and yet this remains my all time favorite guilty pleasure movie because it is prime 80's, early 90's action. With supporting characters like the always reliable Sam Elliott and Kelly Lynch as Dalton's love interest, Swayze round house kicks the hell out of the local thugs and eventually rips a guy's throat out. It is completely ludicrous and over the top, but I adore this movie for those qualities.",1494806400,4,923,4.811320754716981

Now re-released by Shout Factory, loaded with more special features, there is no reason not to have this in your collection. (no matter how many times previously it's been released. Bravo Shout Factory keep em coming..Swayze is Dalton, a cooler who is the best in the business. Dalton has a degree in philosophy, but chooses to make his big money taking bars that are way to violent and dangerous and cleaning them up. He drives to Jasper (because he doesn't fly...too dangerous...his words) To work at a bar called the Double Deuce, this is the cream of the crop for fights,drugs and violence.

138695,5,0792834976,"Shout Factory's 2 disc collector's edition bluray of the 1989 cult classic ""Road House"" is the definitive release of this great film. It includes all of the extras from the special edition DVD release along with over 2 hours of excellent brand new extras.

The new 2K transfer struck from the interpositive  and supervised by legendary original cinematographer Cundey absolutely blows away the prior bare bones bluray release by MGM/20th Century Fox which featured a dated and creaky old HD master that was sorely lacking by comparison. Detail is greatly improved, the contrast much more natural looking, the colors are amazingly deep and the grain structure much better retained. It also features a little bit more picture information on all sides of the frame compared to the MGM disc. All in all the movie just looks much more film like and natural. Some people are complaining that it is now too bright compared to the MGM bluray but I sorely disagree. The new Shout Factory transfer shows how dark and poorly resolved the MGM transfer was in hindsight. Both commentary tracks from the special edition DVD release featuring the director on one and super fans Scott Mosier & Kevin Smith on the other were ported over as well. The audio is presented in two options: 5.1 master audio and the original lossless 2 channel mix.

Disc 2 houses the special features including all of the featurettes from the special edition DVD release which are accompanied by over 2 hours of brand new extras as follows:
NEW The Making of Road House  interviews with director Rowdy Herrington, actors Kelly Lynch, John Doe, Kevin Tighe, Julie Michaels, Red West, Lisa Niemi Swayze, casting director Jackie Burch, director of photography Dean Cundey, editor Frank Urioste and more
NEW Remembering Patrick  interviews with Lisa Niemi Swayze, Rowdy Herrington, Terry Funk, Kelly Lynch, Marshall R. Teague and more

All in all this release can truly be called definitive. The film looks and sounds better than it probably even did in theaters and the new extras are amazingly well done along with the inclusion of the previous DVD extras too. The only thing that could have made this release better was the inclusion of deleted scenes. Fans of ""Road House"" should buy this without thinking twice.

138781,4,0792834976,For a 100% guy flick its really tough to beat Swayze`s classic Road House. This movie is a major blast and has one of the top best fight scenes in movie history. The only reason I didn`t rate it a 5 is because there are a few silly parts but I guess thats also part of the fun. The late great Patrick Swayze holds the movie together with a seriously underrated performance. He creates a fantastic character in Dalton and commands the screen for the entire runtime. Not quite as good as Point Break or Ghost but its almost up there. Awesome flick!,1456358400,2,546,4.310679611650485

The only Oscar it didn't win was Best Special Effects becaus there weren't any.  People couldn't believe Swayze's moves weren't CGI but that's just how badass he was.

138814,2,0792834976,"Joel Silver, when he gets his hands on a good script, e.g. ""The Matrix"", can be a really good producer. The problem is, he cannot seem to tell a good script from a bad one. Enter ""Road House."" This is some pretty awful stuff. How this ever got the green light is way beyond me.

Here's the scoop. Patrick Swayze plays Dalton, a 'cooler' aka bouncer in a Texas bar. A club owner in Kansas (Kevin Tigue) hunts him down because he hears Dalton is the best. (I never knew bouncers had reps that traveled such distances). He needs Dalton to clean up his club and make it a respectable place. They come to terms and Dalton heads to Kansas. Problem is the whole town has a bigger problem than the degenerates at the club. It comes in the form of Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) the local thug who squeezes all the local businesses for protection money. Therein lies the rub.

This is ludicrous. That a bouncer can gain such a reputation perspective employers seek him out just made me shake my head. Then there is the club itself. This is such a toilet I'm amazed anyone even goes there. Fights break out every few minutes. Beer bottles are thrown so often they have to guard the stage with chicken wire. What is really happening here is the showdown with Gazzara. He's just nasty. He has no compassion whatsoever. He's so one dimensional he reads more like a cartoon character. Now let's shine a light on Dalton. He's obviously good at what he does and he got his degree in philosophy. We even see him practicing Tai Chi in the morning. But he smokes cigarettes. Anyone else see a contradiction there? So, we wade through the garbage to see the final confrontation between good and evil.

This was released in 1991 so there is a lot of big hair, clingy dresses and curvy women. But the writing is suspect. The directing is suspect. The editing is suspect. The best thing here is seeing Jeff Healey performing some great tunes. Unless you have to see everything Swayze has ever done, I'd stay away from this stinker.",1447545600,,2003,4.482191780821918
138815,4,0792834976,It was a great movie. Except for the fact that I paid almost $4 for a 30 year old movie that I could have got for FREE on Netflix.,1447113600,,130,3.5172413793103448
138816,4,0792834976,"if it weren't for the fact that this movie is essentially a ""B"" movie (albeit a high class ""B""), I would give this one a five. there is a healthy dose of testoserone in this movie. in fact, you may want to lay off your viagra pills after watching because this one raises ass kicking to a new level. however, its the little things that make this movie great. sam elliot for one is a pleasant addition as the wise mentor to swayzes' youthful energy. john doe of X makes a pleasant entrance as a sleazy bartender who needs a lesson in civilility every now and again. there is even the great jeff healey to add to the musical mix. taken all together, with the experience of the producers of 'die hard' and commando, you have an explosive mix from which swayze simply sings. you get a feeling that the actor was made for this part as a lead. he is not over the top, even for this movie, as he has to play it cool as the lead bouncer of a wild, off the hook bar. his presence is felt immediately as order is restored- he has to kick ass in the process(its simply part of the deal). as the lead bouncer, swayzes character bites off more than he can chew, as he gets to deal with deep corruption. dalton refuses to get involved, as a level headed business man. however, things get personal, and again, dalton must continue to kick even more ass(you get the picture).

i really believe that swayze was one of the great leading actors of his time. but his choice of movies tended to be on lower end of the A list. ironically this is what made him great. he was a serious actor and performer, just not a shakespearean. most actors are limited by their lack of physicality and fighting ability. swayze knew this was his strength and played to it. movies like red dawn and point beak are classics in their own right.",1447027200,,1803,4.287390029325513

138886,5,0792834976,"Roadhouse was another one of the films that for some reason I was curious to see again (I first saw in my teens) in order to get a glimpse and understanding in what my late adoptive mother enjoyed and how it may have indirectly influenced my own interests (due to the fact that Patrick Swayze was one of my late adoptive mothers favorite actors). Anyhow Roadhouse has Patrick Swayze starring as James Dalton a skilled bouncer who does not hesitate to stand up for himself or anybody who breaks the given rules at the bars that he works at. James Dalton is working at a popular New York City Bar when  Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) offers him a job working at a bar that he is opening in Missouri. James Dalton ends up running the new bar very well, but ends up having to deal with some of the locals in his new hometown wanting to seek revenge in a harsh way. What complicates matters is that falls in love with a woman named Dr. Elizabeth Clay who has a past history with influential businessman Brad Wesley. Brad Wesley is a harsh rival going after Dalton because of the threat that Dalton poses to how he has previously run things. Dalton finds out about Clays history because a popular musician named Cody (Jeff Healey) told him Clays past marriage. Daltons friend Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott) becomes concerned about the well-being of Dalton after a phone call due to Dalton dating an ex of a hostile enemy. Wade also questions the danger and risks of Dalton staying in his adopted Missouri hometown.",1437091200,,1502,4.5424354243542435

138890,5,0792834976,"Yes.

Patrick Swayze plays an under-sized / improbable a-- kicking bar bouncer (cooler). I absolutely get a kick out of this movie. I've been in a few bars myself and 'seen' my fair share of brawls. None were this cool (invariably, the brawl winds up on the floor* really really quick). But you gotta see this if you like Ben Gazara, Swayze or bar culture. A must have.

I really get a kick out of how homogenized the bar demographic is; mid-20's to early 30's guys and gals, all fairly good looking. And the bar is just f--king packed. And no latino americans or african american americans, just european americans. It's like a cookie cutter look at a bar. And if you travel the country, let me know where you find this bar 'cuz I don't think it exists. Maybe in a town of 500,000 that only allowed folks of that ethnic persuasion and age group could you get a crowd like that. But the town in the movie? Maybe 50 people on a crowded night, 100 with a good band.

The fight scenes are epic and worth the price of admission. The climatic scene does not disappoint and is chock full of 1980s goodness.

There was a bar in Camarillo, Ca., that was shaped like the bar in Road House. It was called ""Gold Street"". Heh. The Lamplighter, then Gold Street and there was one right next to Gold Street. The early 1990's were fun time alright.",1435795200,,1333,4.362903225806452

138907,5,0792834976,"'Dalton' (Patrick Swayze) is a 'Cooler' / Bouncer' and is one of the best at what he does....
'Frank Tightman' (Kevin Tighe) owner of a club called the 'Double Deuce' in 'Jasper' Texas, head-hunts 'Dalton' his club
has been dragged down in recent times by thugs, the price is right, 'Dalton' accepts the challenge.
After assessing the situation he swings into action soon taking control of proceedings ridding the club of the drug-pushers
and thieves...
However 'Jasper' is run and more or less owned by the evil and controlling 'Brad Wesley' (Ben Gazzara) who begins not to
appreciate the new-boy in town holding sway on some of the residents.
'Dalton' doesn't go looking for trouble, however it tends to find him......of course it wouldn't be a 'Patrick Swayze' movie
without a touch of romance, this comes in the shape of the local hospital Doctor, 'Elizabeth' (Kelly Lynch)
'Dalton's' friend and mentor 'Wade Garrett' (Sam Elliott) also a 'Cooler' turns up in town to catch-up......
Things have quickly turned nasty in town as 'Brad Wesley' turns up the heat to show who's boss, however when he orders his
thugs to send 'Dalton' a message by getting to friend 'Wade' it gets personal for 'Dalton' ....which will lead to a bloody showdown.
The film starring the 'late' 'Patrick Swayze' could almost be considered a cult-classic....this an enjoyable drama with numerous
action sequences on-board.

138923,3,0792834976,"There is much discussion elsewhere on this film in terms of plot summary, meaning,value, and acting, so I won't get into that. My reviews and my ratings for all Blu Ray discs are strictly regarding the quality of the transfer from Standard Definition to Blu Ray. Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, 7.1 esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that. My 3 stars are based upon the quality of the Blu Ray and not necessarily the movie itself which, over the years, I find to be a guilty pleasure of sorts and Sam Elliot steals every scene he is in.

VIDEO QUALITY.....
  The Blu Ray of Road House that I am reviewing has a red disc container and the wrapper said it was the 25th Anniversary edition. Do not be fooled by this as it is the same as the other BluRay releases. It has not been remastered in any way.  Color grading is generally warm throughout the film with a  bit of inconsistency in terms of imaging from one scene to another.  In many scenes the shots are just beautifully presented and, in others, you can see a hint of grain coupled with a softer focus.  I found nothing really distracting other than some of the female actor's 80's hairdos. Damn, they were funny.  I saw no dirt or artifacting anywhere but some haloing could be seen around some of the characters in the bar scenes.  Average Mbps rates were in the low 20s which further proves to me that no remastering was done.  In fact, and I don't know why, I believe that they overdid some of the digital noise compression in some parts of the film which probably accounts for some of the film's softness.  Never the less, overall, the film looks pretty decent.

AUDIO QUALITY....
  The DTS HD MA lossless codec is always a necessity on Blu Rays as it greatly reduces audio compression and opens up the sound. However, the advantage of utilizing the 5.1 speaker system seems lost on this disc.  While the sound track played by the Jeff Healy band is a great one and the front surrounds do an excellent job of producing the stereo of the recordings, the rest of your speaker system is left behind as an afterthought.  Though there are a few half way decent pans between the front and rear sound stages, foley fx or any discreet directionality to any of the speakers is no where to be found.  With all the explosions, fights and cars flying through the air you would think that these scenes would certainly have some discreet use of the home theater speakers but nada.  There is one scene where 'Reds' store is blown up and you can definitely hear distinct fire coming from the left and right of the front surrounds but that is about it.  Dialogue, for me, was easily discernible and intelligible though not with the open transparency of the dialogue I have heard on a great many other discs on Blu Ray.  There were plenty of opportunities for a proper audio remix but the producers don't seem to care.

EXTRAS....Other than the Roadhouse trailer, there are no extras.  There are, however, 3 previews of old movies which amount to nothing more than ads for other movies. These ads call for  greater compression of the movie you are paying for and I resent having to do so.

Roadhouse is a fun movie to watch and the very low price of it makes it worth adding to your collection. Just don't expect a fantastic aural or video experience.

I do hope this review has been of some help to your in deciding your purchase. All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.

Swayze plays the mysterious and almost mythical bouncer who comes to the biker bar from hell to clean it up. The problem is that the whole town is run by a wealthy sleazy narcissistic psychopath. Lots of good fight scenes and good music too. The hilight is probably getting to watch Sam Elliot who is always a treat to see. Love interest is blonde Barbie who is also the local doc. Thankfully Swayze did not believe in graphic sex scenes so we are spared the embarrassment. There is just enough to foreshadow what was to come the following year in ""Ghost."" Funny that they do play the exact same song during the love-making scene that they play during the love-making scene in ""Dirty Dancing."" Were they just trying to capitalize on the previous success? Looks like they could have chosen a different tune. There are no great bonus features on this dvd and by that I ultimately mean either a behind-the-scenes making of/ retrospective or a feature commentary with Swayze. He must not have been a fan of dvd commentaries because of all the movies of his I have on dvd- probably all of his ""big movies"" like Dirty Dancing, Ghost, Point Break, City Of Joy, Red Dawn, Too Wong Foo, North and South and some others Tiger Warsaw, Grandview USA, Uncommon Valor, Youngblood, not once does he do a feature commentary. The only instance I can find is on The Outsiders re-issue The Complete Novel he does participate in a feature commentary with certain other cast members. This is the only time I can find that he does this. Not even on his show The Beast but obviously he could not since he passed away before this show came out on dvd. What a shame because as a Swayze fan I would love to hear commentaries with him. Sadly we never will. But Roadhouse is a good Swayze movie- sensitive with action and even a little humor.

Dalton(Patrick Swayze), a legendary bouncer who comes to Jasper, Missouri, for a special purpose: to restore order at the notorious Double Deuce bar. In one spectacular fight after another, Dalton rids the bar of thugs and henchmen. But when he runs afoul of a ruthless crime boss (Gazzara) who controls the town, the stage is set for a blistering showdown that'll leave only one man standing!

139335,5,0792834976,"My guess is that the majority of people reading the reviews of Road House have seen the film, if not once, then multiple times. That said, I don't think I could offer ""spoilers"" for a movie so well known, but as a courtesy to anyone who hasn't seen it, I'll refrain.

This is EXACTLY the kind of entertainment that made it into ""heavy rotation"" on cable TV. It's made for late night viewing, just kicking back and getting lost in the nonsense under the roof of the Double Deuce. Swayze does a great job with the Dalton character, who is extremely conflicted. On one hand he practices Tai Chi and  mouths a lot of pseudo Zen wisdom, but on the other hand, he makes a living cracking skulls. Sam Elliott shines as Wade Garrett, Dalton's friend / mentor. Garrett's age and degree of physical decline after years or abuse  don't stand in the way of him still being the best at his chosen trade, but when he goes one on one with Brad Wesley's goon Jimmy (Marshall R. Teague), it's Dalton who steps in to save the day. Speaking of Brad Wesley, its' a signature role for Ben Gazzara. His unrepentant glee upon every act of aggression keeps him from being a ""sympathetic character""...he's just plain BAD, in the grand tradition of Edward G. Robinson's ""Johnny Rocco"" from the Bogart classic ""Key Largo."" Kelly Lynch as Dalton's love interest is a bit of a stretch, unless you view the character as a woman smart enough to know better but still drawn to the ultimate ""bad boy."" At one point she looks him right in the face and tells him ""I KNOW you're not a nice guy."" The heart wants what the heart wants, you know? Each time the plot moves forward, it's in a pretty inevitable direction. If this were a mystery, the butler DEFINITELY would have done it. That said,  it is also a truly sublime film, laced with a wealth of performances from the late Jeff Healey. The bad guys are impossibly bad and the good guys, in the great tragic tradition, have ""heroic flaws."" The movie set a template for MANY inferior imitations that followed (including an actual ""Road House 2""). The movie gets played to death on TV for one reason...its a genre classic, another brilliant of a movie that is so bad it's legendarily good.",1391299200,,2205,4.505

There's his closely guarded Mercedes coupe and simultaneous propensity for buying old muscle cars to drive to work, and putting four spare tires in the trunk.  If that weren't enough, you could like this movie because of the subtle things such as a hot leading lady who's also a professional (although she's got big hair, but it's the 80s so we'll let that one slide), coffee on a first date, and Tai Chi in the morning.  There's a fair bit of bad-ass thrown in and you can't deny that it's fun to watch him throw those jokers around.  At the end of the day, though, it's about principles, and this movie is chock full of principles- ...and monster trucks.

139528,5,0792834976,"A letter from Lord God Jesus arrived a few days ago, and it was titled ROAD HOUSE. Less an experience than a phenomenon, it's a film that deserves not only its own theme park ride, but its own damn theme park. Strange--I used to have other favorite films, but their titles, characters, and plots now escape me. I also find it impossible to think of other directors--Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, etc.--as anything more than adequate after delighting in the delicious sensuality of Rowdy Herrington's directorial skill. In days past, I would scoff at those who claimed that a particular experience changed their life, but now I scoff at my scoffingness.

Witness: Patrick Swayze! Oiled! Tai Chi! A monster truck! Ben Gazzara! Breasticles! Buttockses! Sam Eliott! Blood! The Jeff Healey Band! Fisticuffs! I could keep exclamating, but you are now perhaps starting to see the sparkling effervescence. The plot? You miss the point, grasshopper.

A taste of the dialogue (for, after all, Road House is really just a screen-based dialogue-delivery device): Just prior to receiving some surgical staples for a knife wound, Swayze explains his refusal of local anesthetic to the sumptuously big-haired and extremely tan lady-doctor: ""Pain don't hurt."" REREAD THAT, and then go kill yourself, because you will never again know anything so profound. If your head can withstand lines like that without spinning around nine times and falling to the floor in a dizzy stupor, then you can get the hell out of my office, my friend. The dialogue is jam-packed with gem-studded treats like that, which you will find yourself quoting from the film forever after, frequently misattributing them to esteemed former U.S. presidents or 17th century philosophers. It's no mistake--Swayze's character has a philosophy degree from NYU. Do you see? IT'S ALL PART OF THE PLAN.

You'll burn all your other films then scoop your eyes out that they might savor Road House as their final, glorious memory. Go now and do it. NOW, I SAID.",1347926400,3,2009,5.081818181818182
139529,4,0792834976,Road House Good fun Sam Elliot and lots of fighting. And a good Finale. Swayze from this era is a fun time.,1346544000,,107,3.909090909090909
139530,5,0792834976,"Road House is a perfect primer for all father's to show their sons before encouraging them to leave the nest and become a man. The movie flawlessly contains hundreds of life-lessons while maintaining an outwardly appearance that it is nothing more than a simple modern day western about a ""not so big"" philosopher cleaning up a local watering hole.

What can your child expect to garner from sitting down and watching Road House? Here's just a sampling of the educational opportunities contained in this cinematic powerhouse:

1) Entrepreneurship - not everyone was made to be a CEO, some of us have to use the knuckle-busting philosophical skills that God and community college gave us. $5,000 down and $500 a night is an excellent start!

2) Real Estate - never build your quaint farmhouse on the opposite side of the river from the town's helicopter owning psychotic. You and your horses are just asking for trouble.

3) Fashion - what do you do with that old picnic tablecloth if you're a high paid doctor? Well turn it into a dress and then go down for some swill at the town's worst bar...of course. (this one's more for the ladies...but Road House plays no favorites)

4) Automobiles - all bouncers own a Mercedes - FACT!

5) Auto-Finance - the best day to get a loan for that new BMW is the same day the local toughs drive a monster-truck through the auto dealership. Commission and paperwork tend to be reduced in importance for a few hours so you should be driving off the lot with your new car and a low rate in no time.

6) Social Etiquette - ""Be nice"". When a guy comes at you and says, ""I used to &*%$ guys like you in prison!"" You have two options...one of them is obviously the throat rip.

7) Romance - not anyone can charm a girl into a naked submissive position by delivering lines like, ""Oh baby, you gonna be my regular Saturday night!"" But with practice and patience...it'll happen.

8) Ballet-Kwon-Do - a seldom practiced martial art that involves kicking and prancing with your toes straight. Fights often explode into well choreographed encounters that both inflict damage to your opponent and keep them entertained at the same time.

9) Home Dcor - nothing spices up a riverfront property like a room filled with stuffed safari (aka poaching) kills ranging from antelopes to lions to the various body parts of town people that didn't agree with you. The topper is always the polar bear...find yours and kill it while in your 20's to maximize the number of years of enjoyment it will bring you.

10) Shotguns - the best way to return a town to peace and tranquility - the pump action.

It is the civic responsibility of all people to be sure that the next generation learn these and thousands of other lessons imparted by Road House to help hone a better society.

For those interested in going the more literary route, I also recommend the books: COWARDS & BLEEDERS AND HOW TO REMOVE THEM FROM YOUR FRONT LAWN by Brad Wesley and THE OFFICIAL TOURIST'S GUIDE TO JASPER: ""OUR TOWN AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT!"" by Tilghman, Stroudermire, Emmett, and Webster.",1342656000,,3078,4.6464088397790055

139563,5,0792834976,"""Road House"" is one of those movies that has an almost cult-like following.  Everyone I know who loves this movie, including me, can watch it over and over and over.

All the leads are alpha males or females in their own way.  Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is quiet but explosive.  Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) is snakey and manipulative.  Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott) is life wise and supremely confident.  Denise (Julie Michaels) is nasty and she knows it.  Doc (Kelly Lynch) is sexy, excessively tanned, and smarter than everyone.  And finally the town's business owners are calculating and determined.  Thankfully they all converge in the town of Jasper, home of the Double Duece Road House, for violence, sex, and some fun music.  What's not to love about this movie that gets cheesy'er and more enduring with each passing year?

The Blu-ray version really adds SNAP to the flick with sharp images, great colors, and a room-filling DTS soundtrack.  Yeah, the hairstyles and clothes are almost laughable, but for those of us who were clubbing (or not too far removed) in 1989 the ""Road House"" is practically a trip down memory lane.

Hey, for $8.99 new for the Blu-ray/DVD combo, how can you go wrong?  If is isn't that price when you read this review, be patient, it will be again.",1300060800,9,1275,4.7889908256880735
139564,2,0792834976,"Not a single second of this beefcake exploitation flick rings the slightest bit realistic, from the endless fisticuffs to the bottles breaking over heads to the absurd scenes inside the ""Double Deuces"" where the world's baddest bouncer has come to restore order. Moreover, we are expected to believe that an actual medical doctor would fall in love in a second with this overgrown battler and accompany him to this unlikely establishment. Still, it is amusing to watch Sam Elliott in his maturity. Patrick Swayze was riding his prime here, though the acting skills were limited to smoldering looks and faked fights with lots of fake blood. This plays on certain Tv stations about six times a week, for some reason. Watch for the absurdity factor.",1295654400,,746,4.976
139565,3,0792834976,"This will have plot spoilers all through it. This is a pretty descent movie if your in the mood for some bar brawling, and a descent story to go with the tone of the movie, having the sadistic Brad Wesley taken what he wants when he wants from the town and its people as long as he has the muscle to back him up, but as pretty as Kelly Lynch is, even though she was a doctor of some sort, her character was and is a blonde headed Bimbo. I mean lets face it, the more Wesley's hinchmen did to Dalton and the citizens of the town the more angry she seem to get at Dalton, saying stupid stuff like: who is gonna save the town from you, but when the town decided to quit setting on their hands and take a stand against Wesley and his men, only then did she change her tune about the way she talked to Dalton, whereas before she wouldn't have anything to do with him. In my opinion he should have kicked her to the curb. Try watching the movie with the triva track on, and its all most like watching a comedy.",1293235200,,1004,4.025
139566,4,0792834976,"Road House Blu-ray Review

Distributor : MGM (US)

Back in 1989 Patrick Swayze was almost at the height of his career and had starred in quite a number of movies, some of which will undoubtedly end up being reviewed here, sooner or later.

So, the first Obscura review for one of his films, just happens to be Road House which comes to Blu-ray through MGM Video in a 2 disc Blu-ray / DVD set, however, unfortunately this Blu-ray disc is locked to region A so people that are still encumbered by that pesky region coding, will need to steer clear of this release.

An action classic of the late 80's, the film is presented in a 1080p 2.35:1 transfer which looks pretty good for an older title. There is no noticeable print damage and considering that the DVD transfers were a lot less than fantastic to begin with, the Blu-ray is certainly an improvement on these previous releases and does look quite sharp throughout the film.

Audio is clear throughout, presented in DTS HD which again presents a huge improvement over the DVD releases although again, there is not a great deal for the rear speakers to do here.

As far as extras go, this is where it gets a little frustrating, on the Blu-ray disc there are none, not unless you count smart menu technology as an extra and the reason for this is probably because all of the extras are present on the DVD disc. This, depending on your point of view, can be a real nuisance as you obviously need to swap discs once you have seen the film if you then feel like watching any of the extra features.

The extras on the DVD disc comprise of a directors commentary, a fan commentary, a ""What would Dalton Do?"" documentary and a featurette. Considering how many deleted scenes from this movie have popped up on the internet in some form or another, it would have been nice to include some here, but unfortunately that opportunity has been wasted. The DVD disc is in fact, just a copy of the previous Deluxe edition release, so for people who have already purchased that edition, there really is nothing new to see here as far as extras are concerned.

So ultimately, if you already have the deluxe edition DVD the only thing that you are buying this Blu-ray for, would be the improved picture and audio. Although it has to be said that both of these things are greatly improved on the Blu-ray disc, they are in no way spectacular compared to some of the modern releases, so whether the upgrade is worth while or not is dependant on how much you like the film or need to have it on Blu-ray. If of course you don't already have the deluxe DVD then this release is definitely the best package of the film, however personally I would rather MGM have dropped the second DVD disc and put the extras instead onto the Blu-ray disc which then at least would mean you don't have to swap the disc over to reach them.

Anyway, as far as this Blu-ray package goes, it's not bad overall, and I was quite impressed with the improved transfer and audio. That being said I just can't help feeling like everyone else did in the movie...

I thought it would have been...bigger.

139567,5,0792834976,"Road House is about a bouncer with a nationwide reputation as being the best at his job,although most say ""I thought you'd be bigger"". Swayze in this movie is more like Chuck Norris than Dirty Dancing. Make no mistake about it, this is about violence, not dancing or romance. Some scenes are VERY sexy especially in the back of the bar when they are ""on brake"", IF, you know what I mean. Hot women, barroom brawls, and borderline Rambo-like action near the end with Norris style martial arts and Sam Eliott(Ghost Rider, etc.) as his backup is Roadhouse. A Spike-TV favorite for years with TBS as a close second. Definitely aimed at more of a heterosexual, male audience which is what I am. Although not a Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris movie, Walker:Texas Ranger does pop up in your mind when viewing this. Pretty similar action and country setting.

139582,5,0792834976,"I like this movie for its atmosphere and attitude. It's mostly night, there is a bar fight or some other kind of fight every 15 minutes or more often. Other illegalities abound (with houses and cars burnt down etc), sex, alcohol and the smell of violence are ever-present. It's a world of its own, with never a cop in sight and the house band always carrying on performing no matter how big a bar fight is taking place around them, and the surprisingly intense atmosphere - you can smell the hot summer Saturday night - draws you in. There's something of a mythical America here (in a modern Western style), at least for a European viewer like me.

First is the packaging that is designed with holes.  Tolerable if you're careful, but I can see some mishaps.  The other is the way they decided to do the extras.  See, it comes with the Blu-Ray version and the DVD version.  Not sure why.  Perhaps they want you to lend it to a friend who doesn't have Blu-Ray.  I dunno.  Or perhaps they were just too lazy to put the extras onto the Blu-Ray disc and had a whole bunch of DVDs left over from last release.  That's right.

139621,5,0792834976,"""Road House"" (1989) is a movie that is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish in spite of the fact that it stinks. Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is the best bouncer in the business, apart from his mentor, Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott). Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) hires Dalton to clean up his bar, the Double Deuce. He makes some headway at first but soon discovers that the real problem is the whole town is bullied by rich man Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara), who has bought off the sheriff, makes all the local businesses pay protection money, and enforces his wishes with a gang of hired thugs. Like a bar fight that escalates into a full blown bar brawl, Wesley and Dalton's conflict boils over into an all out war. Dalton calls in Wade Garrett for back up, and the fight is on. There you have ""Road House"" in a nut shell, but speaking of nuts, did I mention that Dalton has a degree in philosophy from NYU, practices Tai Chi to get ""centered,"" and believes that pain doesn't hurt?

""Living in Oblivion"" was an independent film that satirized film making. In it, James LeGros plays Chad Palomino whose terrible ideas for blocking really sabotaged every scene he was in. He seemed to be a parody of Brad Pitt. Actually, Brad was supposed to play Palomino, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. So, James LeGros has indicated that it was actually Patrick Swayze whose self-involved attitudes and mannerisms were lifted.

The two had just worked together in ""Point Break,"" which also starred Keanu Reeves as ex-football player turned FBI agent Johnny Utah trying to crack a case involving a gang of surfers who rob banks wearing masks of ex-presidents. Swayze is Bodhi, the leader of the gang of surfers. Bodhi is short for Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva is a term in the Buddhist religion meaning an enlightened being who, out of compassion, forgoes nirvana in order to save others. Bodhi means ""wakefulness.""

I can't help thinking that the film makers of ""Point Break"" must have seen ""Road House"" and wanted to up the ante for Swayze. Why settle for a bouncer/philosopher when you can have a bank robber/Bodhisattva/surfer? I have yet to see ""Point Break"" but believe you me it is on my list. As for ""Living in Oblivion"" I would have to say that ""Road House"" is a vastly superior movie. Swayze may be self-involved, but his commitment to his character delivers results. Road House kicks Oblivion's ***!

----------------
Dalton: Sorry, we're closed.
Ketchum: Then what are all these people doing here?
Dalton: Drinking and having a good time.
Ketchum: That's why we're here.
Dalton: You're too stupid to have a good time.
=============================

""Road House"" is too stupid for you NOT to have a good time. When Brad Wesley and his thugs want to make a point to a car dealer who refuses to pay protection money, why not smash his cars with a monster truck? You could sell tickets to that. I can almost hear the announcer's voice echoing. Other incongruencies in ""Road House"" are the fights which are invariably hand-to-hand when guns would be more efficient and make more sense. Guns are only used as a last resort, and while that might not make much sense in the real world, it makes for a more exciting movie, not to mention a bonanza for stunt men.

Also getting much needed work from ""Road House"" were Tito Larriva from The Plugz, John Doe, singer and bass player of X, and Jeff Healey of the Jeff Healey Band. Tito (Humberto) Larriva's band Cruzados was featured in the opening scene where Tilghman goes to the Bandstand to hire Dalton. Tito! I remember him well, and even met him backstage at the Berkeley Square where I complimented his song writing. The Plugz did a song called ""Achin' to Break Your Heart"" that showcased Tito's Telecaster and passionate singing that I particularly enjoyed. John Doe, also out of L.A.'s punk scene, was playing a bartender, not a musician. In fact, he was a real jerk, since he considered himself fire proof due to his uncle being Brad Wesley. Jeff Healey plays Cody, the singer guitarist for the house band at the Double Deuce. His band is featured throughout ""Road House,"" and he also gets to act, though he is essentially playing himself. His signature is an unorthodox style of playing the guitar flat in his lap. He is also, like Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, or Ronnie Milsap, blind. Last I heard he owned a bar where he features live bands and usually plays the last set himself.

All decked out with no place to go? Why not take it to the ""Road House."" You are guaranteed to have a real good time. Just don't eat the big white mint.

----------------
Wade Garrett: This place has a sign hangin' over the urinal that says, ""Don't eat the big white mint"".

139622,3,0792834976,"I first saw this one in the theatre, and several times a year or so after that when it reached the premium cable channels (e.g. HBO, Cinemax, etc.).  Since several of the reviews don't qualify as actual reviews but more critiques of the packaging (legitimate complaints, folks, but still - that's not a review), let me offer up a brief synopsis.

Patrick Swayze stars in this one as a professional bouncer who has handled security at many bars and roadhouses (and the seedier, the better, it seems, certainly for the story's purposes) around the country.  He arrives at this particular dive in a small town in Missouri, where the house band is played quite wonderfully by the Jeff Healey Band (the soundtrack includes the hits from the JHB's debut album, and their appearance in this film no doubt boosted their popularity at the time on pop and classic rock radio); they are forced to play behind chainlink fence due to the rowdiness of the regulars - fights ensue every night that end in many broken chairs, tables and bodies.  (Indeed, not long after the Swayze character's arrival, there's a scene in which the bar's owner jokes ""Well, it was a good night - nobody died!"")  Swayze's character is a very cool customer with a black belt in karate and a very clean lifestyle - including, as in one connecting scene, daily morning tai chi practice - as well as a no-B.S.-tolerated style of management.  As he informs the bar's staff at one meeting:  ""It's my way...or the highway.""  (Compelling dialogue!)

Very soon, of course, he begins cleaning house quite effectively; staff caught indulging in the bar's stock-in-trade during work hours are summarily fired, as are a bartender and a sexy waitress caught making the beast with two backs in a storage room.  The town itself is home to a very wealthy, very corrupt man played by Ben Gazzari who does as he pleases and who, it seems, owns the roadhouse.  Several local businessmen and neighbours to Gazzari's character are often harassed and persecuted by him, yet they feel themselves powerless to do anything.  Swayze's character seeks to rally the ""troops"" by standing up to Gazzari's character; as he succeeds in turning the roadhouse into a respectable and more peaceable watering hole, he turns his attention to the town...with rather more mixed results, and a fairly predictable ending (our hero wins, but for those of you who haven't seen this movie, I won't spoil the plot - rent this movie first and watch it, then, if you like it enough to watch it repeatedly, give your money to Amazon or any other retailer you feel deserves your hard-earned pay).

Subplots include Swayze's romance with a local and very attractive blonde physician (whose first encounter with him is an appointment sewing up an injury from a fight early in the film, in which Swayze's character grunts manfully as she stitches him up and offers up some sage wisdom:  ""Pain don't hurt"") and the arrival of a long-time buddy and fellow bouncer, played by Sam Elliott, who does what he can to help Swayze's character, but doesn't survive the film, since the hero always has to have a buddy who'll take the fall for him.

So...is it worth owning on Blu-ray?  If action flicks are your thing, absolutely.  For the more serious movie buff, probably not.  The ending is fairly satisfying, and I particularly dug the Jeff Healey Band doing Dylan's ""When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky"" over the end credits (a good late-period Dylan song covered to perfection), but otherwise, this is pretty pedestrian stuff.  You pretty much know what's going to happen from the outset.",1247356800,5,3601,4.816558441558442

Overall, this is a good blu-ray release as far as content.  The blu-ray is bare bones, however this release includes the DVD that has all of the extras from the last DVD release(yes, it has Kevin Smith's and Scott Mosier's commentary track).

Now for the bad.  The packaging is awful.  The case looks like a normal blu-ray blue plastic case until you remove one of the discs and reveal the spaces or holes in the plastic.  And the best part?  The holes are right where the disc is resting in the case, which means if any blunt or sharp object hits the case, it will go through the thin plasic sleeve cover and the paper cover and damage the disc.  I imagine amazon will have a lot of damage returns with this one since they are sending it in a bubble lined envelope (it really needs to be shipped in a box).  My blu-ray cover was punctured in the front and the DVD was slightly damaged by a very visible scratch.  Fortunately the disc still played just fine, but now the Road House front cover has a small hole right on Patrick Swayze's neck line.  Lovely.  I won't be returning it since the same thing will probably happen again (possibly worse) and both of the discs play anyway.

The eco-friendly packaging was a HORRIBLE idea.  Since I like my discs to have some kind of protection, I'll be putting the discs in a different case and tossing this eco-friendly junk.  They might as well send these in a thin paper sleeve.  It's ridiculous.",1244246400,36,1585,4.3951890034364265

139629,5,0792834976,"Roadhouse is one of those movies that everyone should take time out to watch. Patrick Swayze is great as Dalton, the philosphical but redoutable bouncer. Crusty Sam Elliott is great, as is beautiful Kelly Lynch as the small town doctor. And iconic actor Ben Gazzara gives one of his best performances as a sociopathic heel who has enough money to think he can run roughshod over the town's decent folks. With its simple, pared-down plot and the gorgeous stars populating its sets, Roadhouse sort of harkens back to the old Elvis Presely movies of the sixties, where the King would play an ordinary, but talented guy who was quick with his fists caught up in an escalating situation. Swayze shows the same type of charisma in this performance. Elvis's former bodyguard and best friend Red West even has a roll in the film as well. The fight scenes are fabulous and there's just enough plot and drama to elevate the movie to one of the best B-movie martial arts films ever. Swayze had the moves, and his line, ""Nobody wins a fight"" lends just the right amount of poignancy at just the right time. If you haven't seen Roadhouse, do so post haste. If you have seen it, perhaps it's time to revisit the old place. Dalton will be waiting for you.",1230076800,4,1240,4.59009009009009

139656,5,0792834976,"The great thing about Roadhouse is that it's beyond ridiculous in many ways.  I simply love the movie an unhealthy amount.  I think we all do.  It's on TV every other night, and it never gets old.  I'd rather watch Roadhouse for the 100th time than eat dinner.  The amazing thing about Roadhouse is, if it were any other movie, people would rip apart the various ways in which it doesn't make sense.  I present you the following:

The Top 15 unbelieveable things about Roadhouse that we all completely overlook every time we watch it
1) Coolers?!  HAHA!  Like such a profession exists.
2) At one point during the movie, the blind guy (Jeff Healey) says to Daulton, ""Good to see you.""
3) A blind musician, with a good voice, a unique style of play, with a good band, resorts to playing at the pre-Daulton version of the Double Deuce?  Seriously?  They can't get a better booking?
4) The drummer from the band looks like Horshack from Welcome Back Kotter.
5) ""I thought you'd be bigger.""  They say this because Patrick Swayze is an inch or two away from legally being a midget; yet, he's the best damn cooler in the business.  Riiiiight.
6) Several people in the movie have the 1980's afro-mullets.
7) Daulton is into Tai Chi AND chain smokes?
8) His medical records provide the fact that he's a bouncer, but also state that he has a Philosophy degree from NYU?
9) Nobody in town has ever heard of law enforcement on a federal level?  Nobody in town knows a lawyer?  How they let Brad Wesley just run over the town is as far-fetched as a plotline can get.
10) For such a small, dirtbag town, doesn't there seem to be an incredible number of attractive women?
11) Brad Wesley rules this town with an iron fist, and the help of about six henchmen.  All the people in town can't fight the six?
12) Anyone who has ever been in more than one fight knows that you have to be fierce, and sometimes get angry.  Yet Dalton's advice is to ""Be nice""?
13) Aside from the fact that Patrick Swayze is as believeable as a cooler as Keanu Reeves is as a good actor, Sam Elliot's scrawny, ragged butt (as cool as he is, he is sorta frail looking) is the guy who's supposed to be even better at the job than Dalton?
14) Does the entire town of Jasper run without the intervention of any cops?
15) The sexually confused lead henchman for Brad Wesley utters the now famous, ""I used to F' guys like you in prison!""  Is that not one of the funniest things ever said during a fight scene?

The greatness of Roadhouse is that you never question the absolute preposterous nature of the movie.  You go with the flow; watch Dalton take out the trash, clean up the Double Deuce, bang the hot nurse, and act as a catalyst for the rest of the town finally standing up against Brad Wesley...and you never bat an eye.

One of my favorite movies of all time.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",1207094400,8,2868,4.381852551984877
139657,5,0792834976,"This movie has it all GOOD GUYS, BAD GUYS, SEX DRUGS & ROCK & ROLL!!

139658,5,0792834976,"With the intensity of Patrick Swayze, beauty of Kelly Lynch, bad boy image of Sam Elliot and the musical brilliance of Jeff Healey this is a movie that can't be missed. It revolves around a bar owner wanting to turn a redneck bar full of brawls, drunks and skanks into a classy club with a clientele that actually knows what a checking account is.  In order to clean out the unwanted elements he hires a Cooler with a reputation for being the best in the business, which is Dalton (Patrick Swayze).  Somehow you'd think a cooler would be bigger, but he works in this role and carries it off without flaw.  He gets to showcase his talents in martial arts and creates some of the hottest love scenes with, Dr. Clay (Kelly Lynch), that ever hit the big screen.

There are some problems along the way, mainly Brad Wesley, the self-proclaimed ""owner"" of the town where the Double Deuce Bar is located.  Wesley and his band of meatheads expect every business owner to pay their ""town beautification fee"" each week and have manipulated the supply of whisky so Wesley receives most of every dollar spent at the bar.  He's use to getting his way and he's not going to give up his profiteering without a fight, he sets out to run Dalton out of town.  Realizing that Dalton is not easily manipulated and/or intimidated Wesley begins sending his enforcers to do the dirty work of getting rid of him, one way or another.  When they can't seem to get the job done Wesley begins inflicting pain and despair among the friends Dalton has grown close to in the small town.

When Dalton thinks he might be getting in over his head he calls in his old friend Wade (Sam Elliot) and that's when things go from bad to worse, the enforcers get bigger in numbers and their tactics get deadly.  People have known Wesley their whole lives but have only known Dalton for a few short weeks, which one do you think they finally take the side of? This one has an ending you don't see coming and though it's deadly it also has moments of humor.

Watch this movie if only to hear the Double Deuce Bar's house band, which Jeff Healey brilliantly sings for and leads.  This movie has something for everyone, the men will love the fighting and the women, the women will enjoy the love story and the views of some extremely handsome men, both will love the music and the humorous moments that have created some of the funniest quotes anywhere. This movie is among my all time favorites list.",1204934400,4,2454,4.489887640449438

Perhaps its the oriental psuedo-philosophy aspect that appeals or maybe its just that I want to be as tough as Dalton (Swayze) is in this film. Might also be that I enjoyed the music by Jeff Healey as well, a great blind blues guitar player, who plays electric guitar flat on his lap.

139677,4,0792834976,"If Dirty Dancing is Patrick Swayze for the girls, then Road House is Patrick Swayze for the boys.  This is what I'd like to call pure trash action.  Great action thats highly entertaining, but accompanied by a ton of nudity and strong language that may not suite everyone.  A strong R rating for Road House, but still ends up being a very enjoyable film, thanks to Mr. Swayze who takes out the trash.

Road House is a typicall full of action movie with a no brain story that actually makes that no brain story as interesting as can be, and placing enough action throughout to make the whole movie worth just about every minute.  Pacing is wonderful, and I was totally engaged. Even watching it late at night kept me wide awake.  The fights are great, and the fights are wild.  I always figured there would be some crazy bar fights, but some, especially at the beginning of the film, are really crazy.  Patrick Swayze did some study up on martial arts for this film, and he even has a scene practicing his katra.  He gets a good fight against a guy named Jimmy, who is basically one of the bigger bad guys of the film, working under the boss.  Its a hard hitting fight that goes on for a few minutes, and then has a wicked ending that I won't say.

Nothing much else to say about the film.  Its a great action pleaser.  For years I kept igonoring Road House thinking it was a pointless movie about pointless bar fights.  Its actually better than expected.  Considered a B movie all the way, I have to say its possibly the best B movie ever created.",1181865600,4,1547,4.36013986013986

Sam should be placed as the cowboy iamgo, he looks the part, sounds the part and as far as I'm concerned can outact ""The Duke"" any day of the week in a cowboy role.

This does not include what I consider to be Wayne's classic picture ""The Quiet Man"", in that he was superb.

Back to Road house, why Ben Gazarra played his role the way he did is beyond me, he sounds, looks and behaves like a character from an old Looney Tunes cartoon that lampoons crime characters.

Not only has this movie, which has been to late night TBS what Whoopi Goldberg is to Hollywood Squares, finally been reissued in a special edition, but now Mike Nelson from MST3K has released a RiffTrax for it!  Road House was long acknowledged as a target that Nelson and the 'bots wished they could skewer on MST3K and he finally got his wish.

Listen, Road House is great.  Tinker, Sam Elliot (voice of the beef council) and the oh so creepy owner of the Double Deuce are some of  the best characters to ever populate small town Missouri.  But watching it with Nelson's RiffTrax playing in the background took the unintentional (i think?) comedy of Road House to an entirely new level.  Nelson is both knowledgable and funny, the kind of guy you wish your friends were as clever as.  If we are ever blessed with a 20th anniversary edition of Road House, I would hope that Nelson's riffing can be included, because I can't imagine watching this movie again without it.

139693,5,0792834976,"It's been said before (and over and over in all the reviews here, so I won't bore you with the details why it's been said) but I'll say it again:  ""Roadhouse"" is a great bad movie!  I do find it funny that this one has earned that type of fond recollection by so many and turned into a cult hit of sorts because of it; while there are literally tons of these type of movies that littered the action/adventure landscape throughout the 80s and early 90s.  Hardly any of them are even remembered much less revered to the extent ""Roadhouse"" is.  I guess it's just one of those things.  Maybe its because the movie has (at the time) bigger stars, a bigger budget and a larger abundance of gratuitous T&A than most theatrically released action flicks that bare a general resemblance to it (of course, you could find plenty of this type of thing lining the walls of your local Blockbuster, but even though they supply the action and nudity, they don't often supply the big stars and big budgets).  Maybe it was just a matter of right place, right time, right amount of exposure, etc.  Who knows; but whatever the reason, I'm glad enough this film has endured.

This special edition does its legacy as a winking-joke-unto-itself proud (Swayze's character is known as ""the best bouncer in the business.""  Where was the annual bouncer convention of  '89 held and how is the winner of that title determined?).  The best reason to pick this up instead of the previous, bare-bones DVD transfer is the commentary tracks.  The first is by the film's director, Rowdy Herrington, which is actually rather informative considering the source material being examined.  But the real treat is the other commentary track by director and professional fanboy Kevin Smith and his production partner Scott Mossier.  Not only is it a great commentary, but the very idea that the producers of this DVD saw it appropriate to include a commentary from someone who has nothing to do with making this movie shows that all involved are in on the joke.  They should have just gone the full nine and held contest to find the ultimate, die hard ""Roadhouse"" fan and let him/her do the commentary.  And I'd be willing to bet, somewhere, Quentin Tarrentino is pissed he didn't get a call (he loves contributing his two cents to cult films that he has nothing to do with other than being  either a huge fan or hating the movie's guts - either way, always an entertaining commentator).

Now if only studio execs would get off their butts and release perhaps the only junk-action movie more loved and clamored for than this one:  ""Stone Cold.""  (It feels like that is the only movie ever made that has not made it to DVD, yet everyone seems to want it to be released, so what gives?!  Since when aren't studios egger to cash in???)  Give us a ""Stone Cold"" special edition and slap it in a two-pack with this classic and you'll have all the craptacular entertainment this side of the old school Steven Seagal flicks you'll ever need.",1153180800,5,2989,4.631878557874763

He has a friend who tries to console him in his own fatherly way, but ends up dying because the true champions stand alone, everyone they touch will die.

He applies what he learns in martial arts into his life, and into his job. Wounds heal and chicks dig scars.

139699,5,0792834976,"This movie is so bad, so stupid, so mindless and so gay that it has become an instant classic. Their is so much mano 'a mano action, machismo, testosterone and blind mindless stupidity, violence and bad hair that you wonder why a female is even in the film. This movie is possibly one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It is sooooooooooooooo bad and soooooooooooooo stupid that it has actually become a classic.

Let me try to break down the reason that I love/hate this movie so much. First... SWAYZE. Good god, for christ sake he looks like somebody from a ballet/break dancing/gay porn movie and he is picked to be some badass 'legendary' bouncer... with a degree in PHILOSOPHY! This moron is supposedly a college grad who actually has a brain and is intelligent but his job and career path and lifes ambition is to be a journey man bouncer in stinky smelly redneck bars. This goof is so famous for being a bouncer that he is known through out the country for his moronic stupid skills and profession. SWAYZE also has the most horrible mullet of all time. He looks like he gets up every morning and spends 3 hours to get his mullet ""just right"". For god sake he has the same hair style as his leading lady in the movie!!!! Also his fighting style looks like something out of West Side Story. It is more ballet than martial arts. And when he actually fights his nemesis, the right hand man of evil Ben Gazarra they look more like they are doing a primal ritualistic mating dance and when they are threatening each other and trying to intimidate each other they appear like they may start pounding each other vigorously and I don't mean in combat. Then you have the great dialogue like ""pain don't hurt"" and the repetitive unfunny running joke, ""I thought you'd be taller"". Good god! Who wrote this crap! The fact that they have females in the movie is a total joke because Dalton appears to be interested in only one thing truely and that is dominating and engaging in man on man physical contact. Oh and don't let me forget his shirtless tai chi as the evil villian watches the every move of his oiled pecs. And the fact that he finishes off his main nemesis in a fight, near a lake with grey cotten sweat pants on and that he has an obvious boner as he pummels the bad guy submission is one of the most unitentionally funny things ever filmed. SWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYZE!

I can't go on. This movie is so bad and is so unintentionally gay or homoerotic (I think... but who knows what was in the mind of the writer and director) that it is a must see and a 5 star movie. It confuses me because it IS so bad and so moronic and so macho and so completely dumb from head to toe that it is great.

What the hell Sam Elliot and Ben Gazarra are doing in something this dumb is beyond me. I can't even figure out why Red West, legendary best friend, high school buddy and body guard of Elvis is doing in this stupid movie. Swayze is perfect because he is a hack actor and just what an 80's action star should be: 1)gay 2)feminine 3)stupid 4) a bad actor 5)able to deliver the dumbest of lines with all the believability in his soul can muster.

139700,4,0792834976,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Road House is hardly worthy of any awards, but boy, is it an enjoyable ride!  It's like a train wreck that you just can't tear yourself away from.

Patrick Swayze, who was the It Guy back in the late 80s, stars as philosophy spouting, NYU educated cooler Dalton.  Not to be confused with a bouncer, Dalton comes in only when the bouncers have too much on their plates.  Apparently his specialty is cleaning up honky tonk cesspools, by ""taking out the trash"" and making them into ""enjoyable"" money-making ventures.  Dalton is apparently so good at his job that he is known by one name only and apparently his reputation preceeds him.  Indeed - - Dalton later tells the town doctor that he is only good at one thing (and no, it isn't that - - it's fighting).  Which provides one of the many conflicts in this movie - - Dalton is renowned for his cooling skills and fighting, but at the same time he preaches peace, reads philosophy books and practices Tai Chi.

Many impracticalities aside, the film is chock full of great music (Jeff Healey), fight scenes, nudity (male and female), big trucks, overacting, drinking, breaking glass, lots and lots of cigarette smoking and, did I say, overacting?

Dalton shows up in small, stereotypical rednecky Jasper, to clean up the local dive bar more commonly known as the Double Deuce, which is apparently the ONLY bar in town.  He runs in to the predictable problems, from employees that steal, deal drugs, pick fights to the usual bad guy who runs the whole town, played by Ben Gazzara who has a strange fetish for fedora hats in this movie. Along the way, he meets and promptly falls for the town doctor, played by Kelly Lynch who is about as believable as an emergency room doctor as Dalton's fellow one-named wonder Madonna would be. To make matters worse, not only does ""Doc"" have a fondness for wearing girlie dresses that were hijacked from a tablecloth sale (think red gingham), but she was formerly involved with Bad Guy Ben Gazzara - - who still carries a torch for her. Her godawful fashion sense aside, it  really makes you wonder how intelligent this lady doc could be, getting involved with the local scumbucket.  This alone should make Dalton jump in his Mercedes and leave town pronto, but of course, he digs his heels in and determines that he must make a stand against the town bully.  Which is all fine and dandy, but why on earth didn't the residents of the town ever think to do that before Dalton showed up?

Sam Elliot makes a much too brief appearance as Dalton's mentor, Wade.  Although the role is small and nearly as ridiculous and stereotypical as the rest of the roles, Sam Elliot is always a joy to watch and has to be one of the most underrated actors ever to appear on the screen.

The film wraps up with the predictable conclusion, giving us an inside look to the town bully's inner compound, which is surprisingly spartan and cheesey.  The Double Deuce has also cleaned up quite nicely, with lines and lines of non-parolee type clientele waiting to get in (WHERE did these people come from?)

If you are looking for a serious film, stay away . . . stay far, far away.  But if you want some mindless, cheesey fun - - a film that is almost campy but takes itself seriously, Road House is a great answer.  There is some violence and the aforementioned nudity - - and of course language - - but once the 80s ended, they quit making them like this!",1138752000,,3454,4.549273021001616

Patrick Swayze stars in what I would argue is his best role.  Disagree?  What else would you suggest...DIRTY DANCING?  Oh, please.  For a chick flick perhaps, but nothing else.  Take a hard look at the movies he's done and you'll see what I mean.  Anyway, Swayze plays this role to the hilt utilizing his athletic prowess and martial arts skills effectively throughout the movie.  His acting is solid and as believable as could be asked for considering the script.

Kelly Lynch is a bit skinny for my tastes, but still looks hot.  That's all that is needed from her and she comes through.  As an extra treat, the film also boasts Julie Michaels in her film debut; she has gone on to be a successful stunt actor and still looks unbelievably hot (check out her website if you don't believe me).

Next, you have the wonderful talents of Sam Elliot (always a great character actor), Red West, and Ben Gazzara (solid bad guy).  Plus, a chuck of excellent small part actors that you'll probably recognize who all do a great job in their roles.

Lastly, let not forget about the soundtrack and performances from the Jeff Healey Band.  Watching them perform is a treat; their studio albums are very good for those that like blues/rock.

139703,2,0792834976,"I laughed my way all through ROAD HOUSE.  If you stop to consider all of the cliches that this film manages to cram into its running time, you will realize that, as one reviewer put it, it is the mother of all B-movies.  We've got a little bit of everyting: a hardcore bouncer with a degree in philosophy, a smart female doctor that falls for the bouncer, an evil mob boss set on terrorizing a small hick town, a bar in the middle of nowhere that attracts hundreds of people every night, an attempt by the mob boss to run an old man off his land, etc. In fact, I'm not sure why I keep calling the antagonist an evil ""mob"" boss.  He isn't a mob boss.  At least that might make some sense (even though we're in the middle of nowhere).  Instead, he is portrayed as a type of dictator, fully exercising his control over the town. Given the ""quality"" of this picture, I expected this evil man to tie the female doctor to some railroad tracks, after twisting his evil mustache, and wait for Swayze to come save the day!

I can't recommend ROAD HOUSE.  It is not a good film  But, it does entertain.  You have to give it that.  I don't know why, but it's a lot of fun to watch this film.  It is a fun that is sort of like the kind of kick you get out of watching MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER.  It's fun to make cracks at this film and watch it crash and burn.  I'm not one who normally knocks a film for its lack of believability, but ROAD HOUSE doesn't even try to keep it in the ballpark.  This results in a decently entertaining film, but one that really can't provide any decent thrills.",1130630400,6,1579,4.1683168316831685
139704,5,0792834976,"To avoid any confusion, by rating this movie 5 stars I am NOT suggesting that it is in the same league as GLADIATOR, THE LORD OF THE RINGS (trilogy), GONE WITH THE WIND or any other top-calibre flick.  However, this film doesn't try to compete with the likes of top-rated movies, and that's the beauty of it.

The story is based on a top-notch bar bouncer (Patrick Swayze) who is compelled to call in his old mentor (Sam Elliot) for an especially tough project.  Instead of just busting heads and throwing hoodlums out of the bar, these guys end up having to save the whole town!

This is a B-movie all the way.  In my opinion, it COULD be the greatest B-movie of all time.  In short, despite being stupid it is also immensely entertaining.  The plot is contrived.  There are aspects of it that are way, way beyond being remotely believable.  It seems the whole movie was inspired by pushing the envelope on the concept of the bar brawl.

Despite its limited plot, the DVD is surprisingly watchable.  I've seen it at least 4 times and it's always fun to re-watch.  Patrick Swazye's considerable acting talents are wasted in this farce, but that's OK.  The film contains a nice sampling of gratuitous nudity, and Kelly Lynch is not exactly hard on the eyes.

So, if you want to watch a movie with minimum seriousness and maximum action, hang a left into the Roadhouse tonight.  You won't be disappointed.",1123891200,57,1403,4.578313253012048
139705,4,0792834976,"What we have here is a big ol' slice of cheese from the 80's in the form of the Patrick Swayze vehicle ""Road House"". Back in the late 80's, Patrick Swayze was riding a wave of popularity that even HE didn't maybe expect, thanks to his role as Johnny Castle in ""Dirty Dancing"". Movies like this weren't meant to be Oscar winners, they were meant for basically what it amounts to, which is a couple hours of brainless fun.

Swayze plays ""Dalton"" (not sure if that's his first or last name, that's all he goes by), a COOLER, mind you, not just a bouncer, who more or less specializes in cleaning up the worst bars and makes them respectable establishments. Dalton gets paid ungodly sums of money, almost unrealistic amounts as you will find out about, to perform this feat. Dalton is paid a visit by a seedy looking guy named Tilghman, who hires him to help clean up the ""Double Deuce"", which is nothing more than a massive toilet that serves booze and a whole lotta trouble.

Dalton makes it to the Double Deuce, and starts to ""take out the trash"". What Dalton was unaware of, which is mysteriously never explained to him by Tilghman prior to his hiring, is that all of the businesses in town, including the Double Deuce, pays extortion money to the town kingpin Brad Wesley. Dalton fires a bartender who was ""skimming the till"", which apparently is bar slang for pocketing money from the register. This is how the Double Deuce was fleeced. And wouldn't you know it, the bartender is Brad Wesleys nephew!

Now. A normal person would have quit and moved on, but Dalton meets the sexy town doctor, and begins a relationship with her. Dalton eventually learns that she was once romantically involved with none other than Brad Wesley. What a small town!

So, thus begins the jealous battle between her ex-lover Wesley and the new guy threatening his stronghold over the town, Dalton. A great cameo by Sam Elliott as Daltons mentor and best friend Wade Garrett makes for good chemistry and drives what story there is along. The music is great, mainly featuring The Jeff Healey Band.

This is actually a pretty good movie, and entertaining right up until the predictible violent ending. Dalton slowly lets Wesley push his buttons until he blows a gasket and speeds to Wesley's compound to chew bubble gum and kick butt, but runs out of bubble gum on the way.

This isn't by any means a ""MUST SEE"" movie, but it has it's moments, and for the cheap price, its not a bad movie for your collection. AND...for you ladies, there's a naked butt shot of Swayze. Let me tell you something, if I was a woman and found that sort of thing attractive, well, I guess that would be a good thing. But I'm not, and I don't!",1120608000,10,2698,4.541152263374485

Patrick Swayze (and he wonders why his career went downhill) plays the new bouncer in town who runs a foul of the local crime boss (Ben Gazzara).  For the story, that's pretty much it, along with Kelly Lynch in a role where she seems to be the only person who isn't brain dead, and poor Sam Elliot as Swayze's old friend who drops by to help kick some redneck butt.

is very good and this bar is something I could see me

at sometimes. And The band makes me give this movie

her by the scene where the monster truck ran over

Another thing I didn't like is the movies attempt to

sound witty but only sound cheesy. It's almost like

the movie makers wanted to see the bad guys as more

than average dumb like thugs. Sadly, it failed.

However, the action was really good and the movie got

better with the addition of Sam even though he started

out quick and toward the end of the movie he started to

not matter very much. I liked the fight with Jimmy by

the lake and pulling guys throats out isn't something

139721,4,0792834976,"The 'so bad it's good' mutation of standard film criticism has reached incredible heights of popularity over the last decade or so, spearheaded by those Mystery Science Theater 3000 wags and subsequently cultivated by certain cinema-fans who have a penchant for drinking spirits and laughing hysterically at the mishaps of supposedly-serious schlock.  But attaining the 'so bad it's good' status is a difficult task; for a movie to enter this rare sphere, the subject must have been originally produced with good intentions, i.e. with the desire of crafting a solid movie despite obvious discrepancies of script, acting, direction and overall thematic construction.  Perhaps more than any decade, the 80's are a fertile ground of MST3K neophytes: the clothes, the hairstyles, the ethics and attitudes, the general emphasis of quantity over quality (especially, but not exclusive, to action flicks), the bottom-line mentality of the studios (sadly unchanged)...even decent entertainment of this period treads the perilous threshold of being dated by sheer visual hubris alone, with mainstay cult favorites like *The Breakfast Club*, *The Lost Boys* and *Buckaroo Banzai* existing as much as archived ~relics~ as amusing Saturday-afternoon diversions.

*Road House* holds the dubious crown of B-rated movies, the ultimate schlock of its era - no mean feat, given the innumerable dreck produced during the excess 80's.  It flopped in the theaters, but has since gained a small-but-devoted following among those who like their cheese served smelly, with plenty of wisecrackin' material to exploit.

The story: Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is the best cooler in the business, a strong silent type who reads literature in his spare moments and for occupation keeps rowdy bar clientele in check through a mixture of politeness and precise fisticuffs.  But there is more: Dalton is a philosophy grad from NYU (!) who occasionally waxes pseudo-profound in between bouts of arse-kickin'. We don't see much of the latter in the first part of the film, however: *Road House* utilizes the 'slow burn' technique, tantalizing us with Dalton's legend (building tension, ya know), and the hero doesn't prove his chops until well into the first act.

Anyway, Dalton is hired to clean up a roadhouse in Jasper, Missouri, the kind of place where ""they sweep up the eyeballs after closing.""  After cluing in the staff to his personal Sun Tzu-esque work-ethic - ""Never underestimate your opponent...Be nice! Until it's time to not be nice..."", Dalton proceeds to accomplish his job via stony stares and martial art expertise, taking time on the side to seduce the local ""Doc"" (Kelly Lynch) and get advice from his mentor Wade Garret (Sam Elliot, just shamblin' through).  Soon enough he discovers that a local business magnate by the name of Brad Wesely (Ben Gazzara, hamming it up nicely) has been exploiting the townsfolk with guns, thugs and a monster-truck (!!).  Yep, this movie's got it all.

Road House is also a comprehensive index of cheesy one-liners:

""It's my way or the highway.""

""Pain don't hurt."" ( <-- one the greatest lines in cinematic history, IMO, with shameless delivery to boot)

""I own this town!""

""You're a dead man."" (--x3)

""Have a Bloody Mary, Dalton? How about some breakfast?""

""Different town, same story."" (--x2)

""Prepare to die!""

And it contains some of the most amusing homoerotic subtext between the hero and an antagonist this side of *Top Gun*:

""You're a$$ is mine!"" (followed a little later by:)

""I used to [anally rape] guys like you in prison!""

...complete with the obligatory expose of Swayze's backside early on, to the pleased gasp of a female recipient.

Yet Dalton himself is a paradox, inscrutably hard to pin down in this rote retelling of the ""good guy cleans up the bad town"".  Who is this man? Dalton lights up a cig every five minutes, and is later presented practicing Tai Chi & qi-gong breathing exercises on the lakeside.  Dalton explains his philosophy to his blonde paramour, then ends it with an awkward expletive.  Dalton preaches peace - ""Nobody wins a fight"" - but lives a life of violence, giving his all to protect the sphere of casual libation.  Who is this man, this Dalton? Even given the emotional breakdown of the third act, where the fragments of Dalton's past are stitched together and the hero experiences an unusual epiphany of doubt, I'm still not sure.  Still, the slow burn of the first half pays off nicely in the last twenty minutes, when the movie abandons such concepts as 'logic' and 'due process' and Swayze is allowed to unleash hell upon the nefarious villains, serving justice with extreme prejudice, followed by an act of ""synergistic vigilantism"" that is as surreally hilarious as it is unlikely.

I'm going to award this film a generous 3 (1/2) stars, for its 80's camp value, seamless conglomeration of stock clichs, and for Swayze himself - the embodiment of American Redneck Rage, tempered with a thin veneer of Sun Tzu.  An essential Me-decade artifact.",1107302400,6,5022,5.089024390243902
139722,4,0792834976,"Judging from the other reviews here, as well as the frequency that this film is shown on television, I can deduce that I'm not the only one who places Road House near the top of their ""guilty pleasures"" B-movie list. After having seen it about four times now, I am convinced that, despite the basic absurdity of the plot, violence, and lack of realism, that it has a kind of strange perfection. At first, I thought of it as a movie that's so bad it's good. But now I'm starting to think of it as a good movie that only pretends to be bad. There is not one boring scene, and almost every character is entertaining in one way or another, no matter how silly or stereotypical they appear at first glance. Road House takes all of the traditional elements of Westerns, martial arts and macho buddy films and rolls them into a single movie. There are tons of fight scenes, a villain with an army of henchmen, a monster truck used as a deadly weapon and lots of improbably philosophical lines inserted in the middle of the action. This is one of the best campy films in the ""one man army cleans up town full of redneck bullies"" genre since the Billy Jack movies. In a way, Road House can be considered a precursor to some of Quentin Tarantino's films, which so brilliantly combine action, suspense and humor.

Patrick Swayze is perfect as the legendary bouncer Dalton, who, in addition to being a martial arts expert, has a degree in Philosophy. The plot of Road House most closely resembles the classic Western, with Dalton being the lone gunman hired to clean up the town. He is actually hired to clean up one very rough nightclub, The Double Deuce, a place where eyeballs are swept up at the end of the night in the words of the club's owner and typical of the film's often hilariously over-the-top dialogue. The scenario at this club is absurd. There are something like a dozen bouncers here, and Dalton reveals that his fee is $5000 up front and $500 a night. If you think about it (bad idea with a movie like this), how is any owner going to pay all these salaries just to keep a bar in the middle of nowhere open? Not very realistic, but no matter. We have to take the film at face value. The Double Deuce contains every redneck cliche, with constantly brawling drunken customers, a crooked bartender, platinum blond women who are quick to perform strip dances, and a country band that has to remain behind a plexiglass barrier for protection against the rowdy audience.

The real villain here is played by Ben Gazzara, as thug/town boss Brad Wesley, who flies around in a helicopter, lives in a mansion and shakes down the struggling townsfolk for protection money. Again, we must not look for realism here. The people he shakes down, such as the owner of an auto parts store and a car dealer, hardly appear to have the resources to support the grandiose lifestyle of an arch-villain, but again, who cares? The self-satisfied smirk he wears and the way he intimidates his gang of goons is hilarious. Gazzara, like several other characters, makes the part work not by being different or original, but by being the perfect embodiment of a movie cliche.

Sam Elliot also has a great part as Wade Garrett, who is Dalton's aging mentor in the bouncing business. He has this role down pat, as a swaggering, hard-drinking tough guy who has seen it all and dispenses macho pearls of wisdom with a lazy drawl. The dialogue in Road House is part of what makes it so funny, starting with Dalton telling the other bouncers with a steely-eyed stare, ""It's my way or the highway.""  Kelly Lynch is Dalton's love interest, a beautiful blond doctor who is both charmed and repelled by Dalton's violent lifestyle. This conflict in their relationship, between the warrior male and the woman who loves him but wants him to walk away from it all, is another cliche, of course. What is so good about Road House is the way it shamelessly throws all these improbable situations and cliches right in the audience's face. It's a great movie for those who are simple enough to take it seriously, sophisticated enough to laugh at it, or some combination of the two.",1103414400,3,4138,4.58029689608637

Dalton, along with his friend Wade, decide to help clean out the town no matter what it takes.  This is definitely one of those movies that is so bad that it is good.

This film appeals to the tough guy in all of us and as far as action goes, it delivers the goods. Patrick Swayze does a good job as Dalton, but even better is the performance by the much underrated Sam Elliot as Dalton's amigo (Wade). Together Dalton and Wade kick butt and show that their bond is unbreakable. Not surprising, Ben Gazzara's character makes you want to reach through the TV screen and pound him to a pulp. There is a spectacular fight scene between; wait I don't want to spoil it for anyone. There is also some really good music in this movie from Jeff Healey.

Well, Road House has got all that and more, and you're going to have a good time. Theres trashy purity about this film thats rather refreshing.
The plot? Yeah, its got one  just enough of one. Patrick Swayze (in what is really the defining role of his career) plays Dalton, a famous bouncer with a degree in philosophy, an attitude like a motivational speaker, kick-boxing moves, and who practices tai-chi. Dalton is one of the damned silliest characters in action film history, but you gotta love his outrageousness. Dalton comes to the town of Jasper outside of Kansas City to help clean up the Double Deuce bar, possibly the meanest bar in cinema history outside of a Western. Dalton whips the place into shape, romances local doctor Kelly Lynch, but then has to face the evil town boss, Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara!), who won't release his financial grip of fear he has on the town. (I believe this was the plot of every A-Team episode, wasn't it?). Every few minutes, people pound each other with their fists, the band plays a loud blues tune, somebody takes off their clothes, and then they knock back some suds. Oh, and Sam Elliotts in the film too!
The action scenes are pretty darned wacky, along the lines of gee, imagine if he had hit him! and plenty of strange martial arts moves, but they're loads of fun. Get a group together with the right mindset, and this is once great party flick.
The DVD has no extras except for a trailer. Imagine what this would have been like with some audio commentary from director Rowdy? I would love to hear his philosophical approach to this film. Im sure he didn't have one, but wouldnt it have added to enjoyment of what Mike Nelson calls the finest American film to hear him just make one up?
At this point, Im sure you know if Road House is a flick for you. And if you know, go for it. It doesnt let you down. If it delivers the goods it promises, it gets four stars in my book. Even if it really isn't that good. But I think thats the point.",1078012800,3,2912,4.61969111969112

It is kind of cheesy, with Dalton being a famous traveling bouncer with only one name, but it shines in every other area. The dialogue is good enough, the story is involving, Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliot are truly great actors, there's a nice amount of gratuitous female nudity, and the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. This is the ultimate guy movie. And as far as Joel Silver's work goes, I think Road House is better than the Matrix sequels.

139740,4,0792834976,"Forget ""Dirty Dancing"": Patrick Swayze's career peaked in this and the similarly underrated ""Point Break.""  It doesn't quite reach the stratospheric heights (or is it depths?) of Arnold Schwarzenegger's deservedly legendary ""Commando,"" but ""Road House"" is still the stuff of which B-movie legend is made.  Starring Swayze as the head bouncer at a rowdy Southern bar called the Double Deuce, ""Road House"" derives its appeal largely from the ingenious idea of having a bunch of rednecks for villains.  You get to see Swayze's Dalton, perhaps the only Mercedes-driving, philosophy-majoring bouncer in history, take on a seemingly endless succession of slack-jawed inbred troglodytes as he tames the Double Deuce and ensures victory for truth, justice, and the American way.
The Double Deuce is one of the those bars where it seems half the patrons are on parole, but that doesn't stop them from throwing fists at the proverbial drop of a hat.  I've always believed that bar fights held vast, untapped potential for the action genre, and this movie more than delivers the goods in that department.  There are about five solid bar brawls in ""Road House,"" with glass flying around, Dalton employing his martial-arts expertise against dimwitted thugs in tight jeans, and blind guitar whiz Jeff Healey providing some rock-solid background music.  Suffice to say, if you're looking for a fair and dignified look at life in the South, you won't find it here.  A trip to the Double Deuce promises to be as nasty and brutish as Hobbes's state of nature, and a lot more fun to watch.
And even for those who can think of nothing that beats Patrick Swayze as an action hero, it gets better: they got Sam Elliott, one of America's most underrated actors ever, to play Dalton's long-haired, hard-living friend Wade!  With an unkempt white mane and that unmistakable Southern drawl, Wade dispenses plenty of rapier wit along with some ...-whippings before outliving his usefulness.  You also get to see Ben Gazzara, slumming it as the snake-like villain Brad Wesley, somehow manage to maintain a semblance of dignity in a movie that seems committed to insulting your intelligence every chance it gets.  And as Dalton's love interest, Kelly Lynch adds little in the way of plot advancement or dialogue, but she does provide some nice scenery... buying it.",1072569600,100,2336,5.059895833333333

Every line of dialogue is a stroke of genius (""Pain doesn't hurt..""), every costume a master work (I was stunned that it didn't win an oscar just for the Pizza Hut (TM) table cloth dress that Kelly Lynch wore!) and the music probably made John Williams weep that he did not do this film.
No one, but no one could have played the Shakespearian character of Dalton but Patrick Swayze. No one.
Although watching it on DVD does not give you the necessary breaks to catch your breath from the intensity of the film like watching it on TBS does you can always pause it and breath into a paper bag for a few minutes and then go back to it.
Dismissed by many, the true fans can see beneath the surface of this film that was obviously hidden in the wrapper of an action film so that enlightenment could be passed onto the masses.

I like the whole philosophy major turned Bouncer it is a nice idea in a film. As far as the other actors go well there is Kelly Lynch who is pure eye candy for the film and will keep any guy interested. Sam Elliot just makes you laugh his character is so dumb and rediculous but very funny. I see alot of people that have been in little films here and there in this film but really the stand out actor here is the star Patrick Swayze. It sure is not one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever created but the film is what it is it is supposed to be a action thriller but many people like myself observe this more of as a Comedy.

139748,5,0792834976,"Road House is one of the worst movies ever made--it's poorly acted, badly written and sloppily directed.  But that's why it's so much fun!
Patrick Swayze plays a bouncer named Dalton who has a degree in philosophy, carries his medical history with him and is known as the best bouncer in the country.  The owner of a hick bar approaches him to help him clean up his establishment since he's come into a large sum of money and wants to improve it.
Dalton's efforts lead to some of the most unintentionally funny lines ever used in movies.  A bouncer having sex with a female patron in a closet tells her ""Yeah, you're gonna be my regular Saturday night thing!"" just before Dalton walks in on them and fires the bouncer.  In another scene, a bouncer Dalton fires shoots back with ""You **expletive**!  What am I supposed to do?""  Dalton answers ""There's always barber school.""
Co-starring are Ben Gazzara as a sadistic rich guy who owns nearly the entire town (a role he hams up with glee), Kelly Lynch as a doctor and Dalton's love interest (though she's really just there as eye candy) and Sam Elliott as Dalton's friend and mentor who comes to help out when Dalton realizes he's not going to pull the job off alone.
The movie is predictable and formulaic, but for fifteen bucks, it's good dumb fun.  For a good double bill of movie trash, watch this with Anaconda!",1050796800,4,1364,4.565573770491803

After he kills Wesley's goon, his girlfriend tells him he's become as bad as Wesley. Is it necessary to use evil means to rid Jasper of evil? Does doing so make Dalton evil? Perhaps Dalton turns out to be as bad as Wesley (smart, enjoys classical music, likes the same kind of women, and is probably as well-read as Dalton.)

139773,5,0792834976,"This is one of the best action films ever made, with plenty of martial arts thrown in. This is in my opinion Patrick Swayze's best role. He plays a bouncer named Dalton who is hired by a roadhouse owner to come and fix up the place, get rid of the bad elements namely the riff-raff that occupy his establishment. Dalton succeeds in doing that and decent people come and party at the roadhouse but there is a problem left. Namely Brad Wesley.
Wesley is buying up the town and forces the townspeople to contribute to his Jasper Improvement Plan. Wesley tries to get Dalton to work for him, but Dalton is insulted over something Wesley says and tells him there is no amount of money that would make him work for Wesley. Now it's Wesley's turn to get insulted.
Wesley has a man working for him that is a martial arts expert and the fight scene between Dalton and this man is one of the most exciting of the century,especially if you're a martial arts lover like me.
Dalton has a friend played by Sam Elliot, another bouncer and when he is killed by Wesley's goons, this motivates Dalton to go after Wesley. But Dalton doesn't kill him.

Ben Gazzara's turn as the kingpin of Jasper, Missouri is remarkable.  Perhaps only one or two times in film history has there been a better performance (possibly DeNiro as ""Jake LaMotta"" or Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"").
However, Gazzara brings a scary realness to the role of Brad Wesley that has been long missing from your typical good guy/bad guy Hollywood movies.

(I'm not alone, either--along with The Shawshank Redemption, Road House delivers a regular spike to the Turner stations' ratings whenever it airs; how's THAT for disparity?) This movie works on exactly the level it's intended to work, as a mindless display of gratuitous sex and slightly less gratuitous violence, and I mean that in a good way. And if you're not the sort of person who watches so-bad-it's-good films, you can take in Sam Elliott's pitch-perfect performance as Patrick Swayze's mentor. Even his worst lines sound brilliant when he delivers them in his been-everywhere-done-everything drawl.

(An educated bouncer who simply wants to do his job right.) He shows that it takes intelligence as well as strength to do this kind of job. He also shows that letting personal emotions govern your decisions leads to trouble. The scenery is very well done, and the action is captivating. Elliott is outstanding as Swayze's former instructor. He is also handled well. (First he is mentioned, then we see him, then we learn his identity, then we see him in action. His character is also crucial for the climax.) Patrick's secret story  from Memphis is handled well. (First we only hear fleetingly of it; then it is strengthened when the villain knows of it; then it is confirmed when Sam Elliott discusses it; then we see it reenacted.) The main villain is handled well. (First we only hear of him; then we meet him; then his role as a villain is confirmed.) Plot structure is also well drawn. Patrick warns everyone against getting personal, but then he is forced into a situation where he realizes his situation is personal. Throughout the movie, we see Patrick take down people who are clearly beneath his level, but later, he finally has to fight a monstrous villain who has his fighting abilities. Even the town is handled well. The villain torments the local men throughout the movie, and the local rednecks eventually make a VERY poetic stand.
