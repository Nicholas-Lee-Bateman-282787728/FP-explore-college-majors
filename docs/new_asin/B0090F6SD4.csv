5200833,4,B0090F6SD4,"I agree with other reviews. The package description of each disc needs to identify clearly ie Disc 6 the Pilot TV version.  But when they do the Blu-ray set that they put the two versions on the same disc (TV Pilot and Theater Movie).  There has to be bloopers, outtakes or gag reel out there.  Interviews too.",1363824000,,310,4.4035087719298245
5200834,5,B0090F6SD4,i am glad that universal finally released it on single sided discs. i hope the also do the same treatment for the original battlestar galactica. season 2 of the show was a totally new direction for buck.dr huer and princess ardala were gone as well as dr theopolis. buck rogers suffered the same fate as galactica 1980. the budget was cut in half. one of the pluses for BR season 2 was hawk. thom christopher brought dignity to this character. twiki was also given a makeover. the voice at first was done by another actor until the fans complained and mel blanc was brought back.,1362009600,,579,4.523809523809524
5200835,4,B0090F6SD4,"...just a heads-up, that BUCK ROGERS: Season 2 contains the NBC-TV MOVIE version of the Pilot, titled ""Awakening"" as a special extra/bonus on Disc #4--this is the FIRST TIME that this version of the Pilot has been commercially available (it wasn't included in the 2004 BUCK ROGERS: The Complete Epic Series DVD set).  The TV MOVIE version of the Pilot runs roughly 9 minutes longer than the Theatrical version and contains at least two additional scenes with a different beginning and a different (more satisfying) ending.  Fun stuff from back in the day...  BUCK ROGERS!!!",1345680000,39,573,5.010526315789473
5200836,5,B0090F6SD4,"The 2nd season aired in 1981 at at the time I was away at school and did not have a chance to watch it.

I liked the show. It was fun to watch and the writing was generally very good. In Season 2, Buck is no longer on Earth, instead he's on a space ship called the Searcher and the mission is to find the lost colonies of Earth that left after the nuclear holocaust in November 1987. Only Buck, Wilma and Twiki are the carryover's from the first season. Their are less special effects in the 2nd season, almost as if their budget was scaled back. The show takes on more social issues. The music is very good, and Buck has a new sidekick named Hawk. They did not start out as friends but Buck convinces him that they have a common mission. I wish that they found some of Hawk's people. On balance it was still Buck Rogers and we got to learn more about him and his past.

The last disc (Disc 4) contains the original pilot made from the movie (theatrical release) from March 1979. The ending is better than the theatrical release. It was nice to see Princess Ardala again. At times I thought Buck was very similar to Col Steve Austin (just in different centuries), but I guess that's to be expected since Glen A Larson was also involved in the Six Million Dollar Man TV show.

A note about the outer case of the Season 2 set. Mine had a massive crack in the inside back cover, and the replacement one also had a crack (only not as large). I guess QC is down a little.",1498348800,,1466,4.173144876325089
5200837,2,B0090F6SD4,"This abbreviated season that was delayed till January of 1981, due to a strike back in the Autumn of 1980 is when this science-fiction drama went downhill, due to a significant drop in ratings and when I stopped watching the show!!!!

In addition to that, thiswas also the season when Hawkman  (Thom Christopher) joins the cast & crew leaving us mourning the loss of the inclusive Dr. Elias Huer  (Tim O'Connor), and when Capt. Buck Rogers  (Gil Gerard) & Col. Wilma Deering (Erin Gray) aboard the starship Searcher and were no longer with the Earth Defense Directorate.
Risking their lives to find lost colonies of earthlings scattered across the galaxy after a massive nuclear disaster, Rogers and Deering encounter strange alien worlds, thrilling mysteries, and untold danger.

This season of BUCK ROGERS also had some interesting guest stars like
*Lance LeGault in the "" Time Of The Hawk "" episode before his co-starring days as the disgruntled Col. Decker on A-TEAM

UPDATE: recently i purchased buck rogers in the 25 century: season 2 new, and i'm a little more pleased being especially being this iteration is single sided discs. however as usual i found after inspecting all discs, a couple of them had scuffs & scratchs. so i ran them on my dvd player and thankfully they checked out ok. as far as the series as whole although dated the special effects still hold up well and some of season 2 episodes story are a little left to be desired.  i would definitely say for classic scifi tv its worth checking into.",1420675200,3,1090,4.4623115577889445

5200888,5,B0090F6SD4,"Buck and friends were a major part of my childhood and even sucky episodes are well-loved by moi, but it is the pilot ""The Awakening"" (with alternate scenes) that led me to this purchase. I had already bought the original DVD release about ten years ago and was saddened that they hadn't included the pilot or done something daring and incorporated the various TV scenes for a fuller, more robust theatrical release version. Sadly, Universal is like Warner in regards to ignoring their fans' interest in the oldies. Warner has its Archives Collection and Universal has its Franchise Collections, but neither seem willing to invest in better releases. Buck Rogers should have interviews with Gil Gerard, Erin Gray, Thom Christopher, Pamela Hensley and even Glen Larson; we should have TV spots, a movie trailer, a making of...feature, a retrospective that includes the comic strip, 1938 serial, 1950's TV series, comic books, TSR role playing game and the webisodes and of Buck's son. But as is Universal's respect for its own commodity goes it's bare bones.

The second season isn't as fun as the first, true, but, in toto, the 37 episodes and the original theatrical release fired up my imagination immensely.

Why five stars? Nostalgia, Buck (cue Twiki's sibilant eebie debee).",1382745600,7,1279,5.056872037914692
5200889,3,B0090F6SD4,"The first copy I got did not include the TV pilot! It said it included the TV pilot and that it had four discs. When I got it, it did not include the pilot, and it only had two discs - the same two discs that were included in ""The Complete Epic Series"". They were even listed as Discs 4 & 5. Be careful what you buy. I bought mine online. If you are looking for the TV pilot, try maybe buying it new at a store rather than online. And make sure it says it includes the pilot on cover before buying. After I got a bad one online, I decided to look for it new in stores. The one I bought at the store actually included four discs and the TV pilot as a bonus episode on the final disc.

The first DVD release of the show was ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Epic Series"" which included both seasons one & two in one box set. But it only had the theatrical edit of the pilot. They made two edits of the pilot, a movie edit that was released in theaters nearly six months before the TV series was released, and a television edit which they aired as part of the television series. Now they have re-released the series on DVD in seasons. Season One still only includes the theatrical pilot, but Season Two includes the TV pilot as a bonus episode. I already had ""The Complete Epic Series"" DVD box set, but being a fan of the show, I still wanted the TV pilot as well. So I bought the season two set as well.

Although I do prefer the theatrical edit, I still wanted the TV edit too. Mainly because of four scenes they added in the TV version (1. The scene where Twiki and Theo show Buck his new apartment, 2. Buck's inquiry about Anarkia - which is the 25th century name for old Chicago, 3. The part where Wilma thanks Buck for helping her fight the pirates but then tells him that since the Princess denied Buck's story that she would have to place him under arrest and Buck tells her that it would be pointless due to the fact that he has nowhere to go that the only home he had is 500 years in the past, 4. The added epilogue scene at the end that features Buck decorating his new place when he is interrupted by Wilma and Dr. Huer who try to get him to join Earth's Defense Directorate.) All of those scenes make the TV version worth buying. However, on the down side, the scene with Buck fighting Tigerman is trimmed and badly edited, King Draco no longer appears in the story, they cut out Kane's last line about getting revenge on Buck Rogers, and a boom mike can also be seen in one scene (the scene was also featured in the movie, but the boom mike does not appear in the movie version). That's why I like the movie edit better, but those four added scenes in the TV version still got me to re-buy a season I already have just so I could watch them.

As for the season itself, season two was a big departure from the first. Although the series was doing good during its first season, the network went ahead and cut the show's budget for its second, the show was reformatted to have a more ""Star Trek"" type of feel to it, they got rid of several characters from the first season, the show didn't have as much action in it, the special effects weren't as good, and Wilma's character was changed from an heroic colonel to the damsel in distress. It's not surprising the show didn't do as well after that. I could see changing a show and cutting its budget if it's not doing well, but if something works, why the hell do they think they need to tamper with it?! But even though the second season wasn't as good as the first, I still found it enjoyable. Most of the stories were still good, and most of them were even taken more seriously apart from the episode ""Shgoratchx!"". And I really liked the new character Hawk played by Tom Christopher. So even though the first season was better, I still recommend Season Two because it was still a good sci-fi show. And even if you're a fan and don't like this season, I still recommend buying it mainly for the TV pilot. Just make sure you're buying a copy that actually has the pilot.",1379203200,11,4041,4.204896907216495
