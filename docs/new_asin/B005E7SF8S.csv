4663809,3,B005E7SF8S,"This is a fair movie.  But seeing Gene Barry dance and sing was a treat.  Clearly his main talent was acting, but this was fun.  But not a great film.",1403827200,,150,3.933333333333333
4663810,5,B005E7SF8S,"This is a good Drama/Thriller starring Gene Barry, Beverly Tyler, Noel Drayton, Allison Hayes, Michael Pate, plus others! This movie is presented in Full screen format, B&W and runs for about 68mins (1hr 8mins). This is about Secret agent Casey Reed (Gene Barry) is assigned to locate a missing Arab prince kidnapped by Communists. MGM did a good job on transferring this to DVD and there isn't any special features. Overall this is a good movie and I would recommend this.",1366329600,6,473,4.851851851851852
8467987,1,B005E7SF8S,This film is so corny that I gave up on it after 15-20 minutes.  It was a real stinker!,1485216000,,87,3.5789473684210527
8467988,5,B005E7SF8S,Maybe I should have given this 4 stars but i really enjoyed it very much. I will be watching this again.,1461283200,,104,4.0
8467989,2,B005E7SF8S,Not very good. Gen Barry is awful as a singer or dancer.,1454976000,,56,3.75
8467990,3,B005E7SF8S,ok,1446768000,,2,2.0
8467991,2,B005E7SF8S,This is a grade C movie. Not very good and I only watched it because I usually like Gene Barry.,1436400000,,95,3.8
8467992,4,B005E7SF8S,Old time movie fun...Good B movie stuff which I live for....,1429401600,,60,4.545454545454546
8467993,1,B005E7SF8S,"Embarrassingly bad acting, absurd story, predictable, little tension, cheap locations. Did someone really throw an empty gun at our hero, hoping to stop the pursuit of justice? Not at all what I was expecting when I saw the 4 star rating. Why weren't all the prints of this movie turned over to the Chinese in 1997? The film world would have been better off.",1428796800,,358,4.609375
8467994,3,B005E7SF8S,Pleasant little spy story decently directed par Edward L Cahn who is doing everything he can with a very tight budget,1425600000,,117,4.619047619047619
8467995,3,B005E7SF8S,Corny but fun to watch.  Gene Barry as a lounge singer is not to be missed.  Target practice needed.  Many gun shots not too many hits.,1424390400,,135,4.115384615384615
8467996,2,B005E7SF8S,Just too cheap and set-bound to really enjoy. But Gene Barry completists will like it.,1411430400,,86,4.8
