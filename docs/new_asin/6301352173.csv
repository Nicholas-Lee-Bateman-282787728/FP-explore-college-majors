326499,4,6301352173,"Jennifer Jones as Gwen really helped make ths one for me. She conveyed a very pleasant reality and was very definitely more noticeable than the other actresses who portrayed Gwen. Other than that, this serial continued the fast action of the previous Tracy ones. The choreographed fight scenes which were a staple in the later Republic serials were outstanding in this and there was one quite spectacular chapter ending, the burning dirigible.  Highly recommended.",1240185600,,464,5.27027027027027
326500,3,6301352173,"I really enjoy the Dick Tracy serials. The first two Dick Tracy and Dick Tracy Returns were pretty good. But unfortunately, this one does not hold a candle to the first two. I rated it 3 stars because its ok, but it was really excruciating to watch. I was bored. I got the distinct feeling that the writers did not pay much attention to script or action.

So, if you're a fan, I suggest you invest in this one. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother.",1223337600,,440,4.301204819277109
326501,5,6301352173,"VCI Entertainment and Republic Pictures present based on Chester Gould's comic strip creation -- ""Dick Tracy's G-Men"" (2 September 1939) (263 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Ralph Byrd was an American actor famous for playing the comic strip character Dick Tracy on screen, in serials, movies and television --- Byrd was a good, all-purpose actor with a gift for delivering dialogue in a natural, ingratiating way --- Once established in Republic Pictures' Dick Tracy serials (beginning in 1937), he was usually cast in action features (as a truck driver, lumberjack, cowboy, etc.), despite not having the usual brawny frame that went with these roles --- He had a strong, resolute jaw, however, which gave him a heroic presence.

Republic cast Byrd as Chester Gould's comic-strip detective Dick Tracy in the 1937 serial of the same name. The film was so successful that it spawned three sequels (unheard of in serials): Dick Tracy Returns, Dick Tracy's G-Men (featuring a young Jennifer Jones, under her real name of Phylis Isley), and Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc. (reissued in 1952 as Dick Tracy vs. Phantom Empire).

RKO Radio Pictures made a feature film, Dick Tracy, in 1945, but not with Ralph Byrd (see the Wikipedia entry for Morgan Conway). After two films, exhibitors complained. To them, Ralph Byrd was Dick Tracy, and only Ralph Byrd would do. RKO accepted this and hired Byrd to finish the series. Dick Tracy's Dilemma and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome (with Boris Karloff as Gruesome) were both released in 1947.

In these respects Byrd closely paralleled screen actor George Reeves (who portrayed Superman): he had the same rock-like jaw, the same acting versatility, the same pleasant personality, the same audience identification with a comic-book hero, and the same untimely death following his TV series's completion. Interestingly, Reeves and Byrd were teamed for two low-budget action thrillers in 1948, Thunder in the Pines and Jungle Goddess, both available from VCI Entertainment (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

326502,4,6301352173,"The Dick Tracy series became the longest running serial in history, at 60 chapters, and this third installment is the best of the bunch.  As is usual with a serial directed by William Witney and John English, the cliffhangers put to shame most of what Universal and Columbia had to offer.  They're great at going on location for the action, like lumber yards, power plants, dams, smelter plants, and other exotic locales that offer the possibility of an unusual cliffhanger situation with fiendish deathtraps.  I particularly like the cliffhanger in an early chapter where a ship is slowly docking next to a barge.  Witney has a barrel get tossed harmlessly in the water, but we see it get crushed between the vessels with a loud crunching pop.  Then Tracy gets knocked into the same spot, unconscious, as the vessels again move slowly together.  Point well made!

Thankfully, both Tracy's goofy sidekick Mike McGurk and his little pal Junior are gone.  He still has his associate Steve Lockwood, now played by Ted Pearson, and Tracy's third secretary in as many serials, Phylis Isley.  She had married Robert Walker earlier that year, before he became famous (""Strangers on a Train,"" etc.).  One viewer reported that she has exactly 204 words in this film, mostly relaying telephone messages.  Three years later Isley was ""discovered"" by David O. Selznick (whom she later married), starred in ""Song of Bernadette,"" and won an Academy Award for best actress.  By this time she was Jennifer Jones.

Irving Pichel makes as outstanding villain, the master spy Zarnoff.  Pichel had been in big-budget movies prior to doing this serial, but he was to make his mark primarily as a director.  This appears to have been his last movie role of any kind before he devoted full-time to directing, mostly in ""A"" films.

One of the all-time great lines occurs in Chapter Nine.  Tracy has just been rescued from being gassed to death.  He comes staggering out choking and says with a perfectly straight face, ""I never did like poisonous gas.""

This serial may have been just about three chapters too long.  After clever cliffhangers through most of the picture, they start getting weaker toward the end.  It runs completely out of steam at the end, and it goes out with a whimper instead of a bang.  Still, I rank it high on the strength of the bulk of the serial.",1136937600,,2350,4.807980049875312

Irving Pichel plays a pretty subdued villain but it is a decent serial and i give it four stars.  the next one is about a criminal who is able to make himself invisible.  don't think i would like that.  seems like an unfair advantage.,1367712000,,641,4.427350427350428
7811241,5,6301352173,"""Dick Tracy's G-Men"" is a 15-chapter Republic serial from 1939 starring Ralph Byrd, directed by William Witney and John English, the third of the four Dick Tracy serials.  In all of these Tracy is an FBI agent, rather than the police detective of the comic strip.  This time, an international spy, Nicholas Zarnoff (Irving Pichel) is about to be executed, having been caught by Tracy.  But Zarnoff isn't quite finished; he cheats the gas chamber, simulating death using a rare drug, and is soon back working with ""The Three Powers"" to disrupt world peace.

Tracy's main helper agent is Steve Lockwood (Ted Pearson), while Zarnoff gets able assistance from Robal, played by Walter Miller in his last serial movie role.  Each of Zarnoff's many schemes is thwarted in a chapter or two, a pattern familiar from the other Dick Tracy serials.  While all four of these are good, both this and the last Tracy serial have increased emphasis on action at the expense of emotional depth and dialogue.  The dropping of Junior and Mike McGurk from this serial is regarded by some as an advantage, but they provided a little interaction among the good guys.  This time, Tracy's secretary, Gwen (Phyllis Isley, later known as Jennifer Jones) is never seen outside the office, and her few spoken lines are mostly answering telephone or radio messages.  But Irving Pichel is splendid as Zarnoff, the action scenes are choreographed well, often with interesting settings, and the music by William Lava provides good support, if not quite at the pulse-pounding level of Republic's scores from the 1940's.  There must have been a budget cut from the first serial; the villain doesn't have a Flying Wing, and the G-men, instead of a Duesenberg, are reduced to driving Plymouths.  But there are a few more ""scientific"" elements than in the previous serial, ""Dick Tracy Returns"" including a remote-controlled, television-equipped boat, and a couple inventive methods of getting stolen documents to foreign governments.  The cliffhangers are mostly believable, with, by serial movie standards, respectable special effects.

VCI's edition on DVD, # 8504, is on two discs.  The image is sharp with good gray scale, properly framed.  A few scenes are a little bright, though never to the point of washing out the highlights.  The sound is mostly good, the dialogue clear, if in a few places artifacts of noise reduction can be heard, such as a little noise present only when lines are spoken.  But the sound processing has been done with restraint.  My main reservation with the DVD transfer is a minor one; it has has the usual ""restoration cheat"" where all chapters except the first have MPPDA number 5429, from Chapter Four.  Not much of an issue in itself, but the titles have been restored a little too well, and look like still frame images instead of a motion picture, very clean with no evidence of grain, causing a disruptive effect at the transition to the rest of the film.  But overall VCI has done a fine job with their DVD, both picture and sound being far better than on the old videotape edition, VCI's # 1168.

There are but two bonus features.  Selecting ""Extras"" from the Disc One menu brings up the theatrical trailer.  Not shown in the menu is a video introduction by Max Allan Collins, who wrote the comic strip for several years after Chester Gould retired.  This appears before the first chapter only if the ""play all"" option is selected, and while the Disc 2 label shows ""Trailers,"" none are on that disc.  The background music with the menu is somewhat louder than the sound level of the chapters, so keep the mute button handy.

I prefer the first Dick Tracy serial for the darker atmosphere and more interesting if less logical plot, but ""Dick Tracy's G-Men"" has fine action and a compelling villain, and it should appeal to those who like the later Republic serials.  But it is best watched with a day or so between chapters, since there is little relief from all that action.  VCI's DVD has only minor faults and is a very good transfer, well worth a 5-star rating by Amazon's criteria.",1359158400,2,4089,4.827833572453372

Though we weren't in it yet, WW2 impinges on the series as our hero (still a West Coast FBI agent rather than the Midwestern local police detective he was in the comics) is pitted against Nicolas Zarnoff (Irving Pichel in a great performance), a spy/saboteur in the pay of the Axis (though, in those days of American neutrality, his employers could only be referred to as ""The Three Powers"") who rather resembles Boris Arson, a villain from the newspaper strip that inspired the film.  Great action.  Great story.  Great direction from English and Witney.  An appearance by future star Jennifer Jones (her last appearance under her birth name, Phyllis Isley; in her very next film, THE SONG OF BERNADETTE, she'd win an Oscar for her performance as the titular saint who saw a vision of the Blessed Mother at Lourdes) as Tracy's secretary Gwen.  Plus the annoying Junior and comic relief character ""Mike McGurk,"" from the first two serials in the series, are blessedly absent.  The framing device with which the first chapter begins, a newsreel giving expository information about the villain, was seen by Orson Welles, who went on to use a similar story-telling device in his 1941 masterpiece CITIZEN KANE.  An introduction by former TRACY scribe Max Allan Collins serves to put the film in historical context.  One of the best serials ever in a great package.",1299196800,6,1445,4.889344262295082
