8284216,5,B001BQ38ME,"This is a beautiful DVD created for individuals with or without dance/yoga experience. Amrita takes you through various movements that are well explained, guided by her soothing voice and divine music. It goes beyond dance or yoga and makes you feel the essence of what these practices were in the ancient times. It is truly a meditation in motion, at times slow, at times fast going into each movement with depth. What I loved about this DVD is the generosity of Amrita's spirit, and the profoundness of her flow and grace. It goes beyond technique and gets to the heart of these ancient practices where dance was yoga and yoga was dance. Thank you Amrita for this gift, it is truly beautiful!",1517788800,,694,4.69672131147541
8284217,1,B001BQ38ME,"I recently bought this very expensive DVD ($45+shipping) and mudra booklet ($35+ shipping) directly from Ms. Choudhury, and what a total joke they both are. I'm very upset with myself for wasting so much money, and extremely upset with Ms. Choudhury for (in my opinion) presenting these products as being much more in depth than what they are. She has only a very few extremely simplistic hand movements which during the ""dance"" (and I use that word very loosely - it really doesn't even qualify as dance) she simply repeats over and over and over. And over. And over. And over. Three-quarters of the mudras in the book are not even used - I don't know why she even sells it except to line her pocket, as it has almost nothing to do with the DVD. The steps are also incredibly simple and once again, she just repeats the same thing over and over and over. It's ridiculous. My heart sank as I actually starting watching and practicing with this DVD, to realize how little was actually on it, and what a colossal mistake I had made it buying them. She has a strict no refund policy, and I can see why. Don't waste your money. If there was a way for me to get my money back, I would. I am furious with Choudhury for charging so much for so very little.",1508716800,,1249,4.364806866952789

8284219,5,B001BQ38ME,"Truly amazing DVD worth every single dollar you pay for it! The music is divine! And everything is explained in a very clear manner. The overall feeling you are left with is of inner peace and overwhelming beauty.
If you are into any form of dancing either professional or just as a hobby I really recommend it, and just to everyone who likes yoga or wants a nice smooth and also spiritually connected workout. There is plenty of beautiful movements and you will need quite some time until you master it and will enjoy it very much while you practice. This is something I've been looking for for a long time and finally found this amazing peace of art. Thank you Amrita Choudhury!",1422576000,,680,4.536585365853658
