1925400,3,B0000DI877,"This production, to me, fails to fire like the metropolitan broadcast with Domingo and Milnes 9 years later.  It seemed as if none of the leads of the leads could match the level of Domingo in a marginally effective staging.

  As i said Domingo is excellent.  As an actor, no one can touch him.  He looks youthful and sounds wondeful as Dick johnson.  Chella mi Creda is a treasure, I can only wish that the Covent Garden audience would clap for anything.  ( I love going to the opera because of the spontaneous atmosphere, with clapping and bravi ect... I cant stand it when an aria finished and, after a tense silence, the music goes on.  The same is true for the 1975 ballo in Maschera with Domingo.  This is a minor complaint, yet something I cant understand about English opera houses.)

  Carol Neblett is a poor Minnie.  the role tazes her terribly and she fails to be a convincing actress, due  to her struggle with the role.  My biggest complaint is that her high note climaxes are often at a slighter volume than her low notes.  this does not suggest she has no voice, because she does have a beautiful voice.  Minnie, however, is beyond her instrument.

  I disagree with the Amazon reviewer who said  Carolli makes a wonderful villain.  His performance is very one dimensional.  He wears an absurd, spotless tuxedo with a mink coat (surrounded by men in filthy rags.)  It is true that Carolli makes an evil Rance, but there is no pathos or pain in the performance.  Milnes makes you feel Rance's pain and desperation, his lust and emptyness.  Carolli is just a bully.  his voice is passable, but is smaller than domingo's often covered by the orchestra.

  The rest of the production iis very good, the sets are picturesque ect... But go with the Met production with Domingo, it is much more convincing.",1098662400,8,1816,4.598746081504702
1925401,4,B0000DI877,"This ""Fancuilla"" is a bit of a mixed bag, an old-fashioned, no frills production, conducted and directed moderately well. Neblett, singing a signature role, is a bit melodramatic at times, and hits some of her high notes by force of sheer will. A not particularly pretty sound. Domingo, on the other hand, is magnificent. Dashing in appearance, passionate and sexy, he sings gloriously throughout. The DVD's overall sound is not all that good -- it was filmed, after all, way before the digital age. That said, I'm enjoying it very much, and can see myself happily pulling it out whenever I need a comforting Puccini/Domingo fix. This is a favorite opera of mine, and I'm not at all unhappy with the purchase.",1091750400,11,709,4.819672131147541
1925402,3,B0000DI877,"I wouldn't reccommend this as a first La Fanciulla del West(looks of the Minnie wise) but singing wise I would. Carol Neblett sings beautifully but she looks so horrible that I can't bare to see a Minnie who looks even worse than she. There are more beautiful looking Minnies, perhaps one of them is in the La Scala video. But Neblett's voice is excellent. Placido Domingo is a good-looking Dick Johnson/Ramerrez and also sings really well. Juan Pons doesn't look anything like someone who would play Jack Rance, he looks more like The Flying Dutchman, but his voice is excellent. In my opinion, the lookwise flaws are for Carol Neblett and Juan Pons, otherwise, good-looking. I have no complaints about Nello Santi's conducting, though. The director should've hired Kiri Te Kanawa or Renata Tebaldi to play Minnie and either Sherrill Milnes or Giuseppe Taddei for Jack Rance instead of Juan Pons. For a first reccommendation, get the La Scala set, and tell me if you see a beautiful looking Minnie or a more normal looking Jack Rance, because I've never saw that filmed version of the opera. I care about the looks too besides the voice, and when or if I become a director I'll hire someone who's more like Kiri Te Kanawa to play thwe role of Minnie. Jack rance shouldn't have long hair at all.",1085356800,,1295,4.709251101321586
1925403,4,B0000DI877,"The best video of this opera is the Met's but this is a good second one for your collection.  I can't stand the soprano in the La Scala version and as much as I like Domingo, I can't listen to that version at all.  I recommend this and have it on VHS as well as laser.  It's not at the level of the Met's production with Milnes and Daniels, however.  That's the best on video.  Worth owning!",1084492800,3,391,4.025974025974026
1925404,4,B0000DI877,"Overall I loved this performance, especially the performances of Domingo and Neblett.  Yes, she may have been overtaxed in the role at times, but for me the chemistry between the two of them was wonderful.  He with a soft edged machismo and she as the tough woman in the wild west but with an obvious feminine side.  I found both the characters very believable.  Carolli was acceptable but not great.  Wish it had been Milnes as in the recording on the DGG CD.  The production values are good but the age of this recording shows.  It definitely does not have the sharpness of more modern recordings.  I've not seen the La Scala DVD mentioned here but I've heard it on CD and while Domingo is as good as always, I find Zampieri's voice just plain ugly.",1070928000,18,751,4.470588235294118
1925405,3,B0000DI877,"If you only want to own one DVD of La Fanciulla, then the La Scala production is clearly the one to buy.  If nothing else, its cinematography is vastly superior to this Covent Garden production, and its sound recording is better, too.  But for those of us who can't get too much Puccini, this production makes for an interesting exercise in compare and contrast.
The two productions are similar in terms of the stature of the principal singers, the orchestra and chorus (which is very important in La Fanciulla), and the sets and costumes.  This Royal Opera production is, as far as I can tell, the only DVD opera that features Carol Neblett.  It's of interest, therefore, if only to see her portray Minnie, one of her signature roles.  Also interesting are some of the decisions the director made in this production.  It is played with very broad gestures -- Silvano Carroli, for example, plays Jack Rance as a swaggering Snidely Whiplash.  He and Neblett wrestle several times as he attempts to impose his affections on her and she resists.  Juan Pons and Mara Zampieri are restrained by comparison at La Scala. Placido Domingo plays Johnson/Ramirez in both productions, so you can see how his interpretation changes over time and in response to the different direction.  He too has toned it down a bit in the later production.
Somewhat amusingly, this production is at times politically incorrect, as in Act 1 when it repeatedly has Indians stealing whiskey when the white man turns his back.  And Gwynne Howell turns up as Jake Wallace wearing blackface!  I guess that's what you get when you have a British opera company in 1983 interpreting how an Italian composer in 1910 portrayed California in the 1850's.",1070841600,17,1714,4.835616438356165
1925406,2,B0000DI877,"The Girl of the Golden West is almost funny in its use of a Western (as in USA) as an operatic vehicle.  The real strength of this production is that looks like a western and the men and Minnie, the important female, look like characters from a western. The sets are excellent.  The acting was also good.  However with the exception of the male lead, Ramirez (alias Dick Johnson), played by Placido Domingo, the singing is extremely wobbly and, in the case of Minnie, the singing was so inaccurate that I could not even imagine what the musical intent was.
  La Fanciulla. . . is a good opera that anyone could enjoy.  You should not buy this version when an musically excellent La Scala production is available on both DVD and VHS.",1001289600,7,732,4.507575757575758
8001163,2,B0000DI877,"Good aspects:
- Though his stage time is short (because of the role), Domingo does a great job as Johnson. The opera starts to settle with his presence, where scenes without him are difficult to find focus.
- Elaborately designed set by Ken Adam. I imagine there's a way this show could be done inexpensively, but Adam and the Royal Opera House clearly sunk a lot of time and money to make the sets seem realistic, but also ornate in a Western style.
- Decent chorus.

Not as good aspects:
- Carol Neblett is neither an affecting actress nor a world-class singer. Her entrance in Act I fell flat and as one other reviewer put it, matronly and school marm-esque. Her high notes were routinely lackluster and beneath the expectations of Puccini's orchestration.
- Silvano Carroli is similarly underwhelming, but this may have to do more with Piero Faggioni's wavering tone. The libretto doesn't strongly suggest how the audience should feel about Jack, and Faggioni misses the opportunity to make a decision himself.
- Color palate is dull. Comes with the Western territory, but there's very little to grab one's attention.",1517184000,,1121,4.869109947643979
8001164,4,B0000DI877,A good production of the great masterpiece this is my favorite opera the problem with it  They cannot compare it's vocally to the  EMI cd staring Birgit Nilsson  it has  best contacting on either DVD or CD and the best cast of any CD and DVD to protection as well as the opera is the total masterpiece  terrific set but my favorite set on DVD is the one from the Metropolitan 2nd best cd is tebaldi and delmonico but week conducting,1497052800,,432,4.283950617283951

8001167,4,B0000DI877,"Neblett's voice isn't particularly attractive but even Tebaldi has problems with this role - and her Card Scene ends up being the best.  Domingo is his usual, stalwart self, singing in his generic way that leaves you wondering what role he's doing now and what emotion is he supposed to be feeling... I don't know if Destinn & Caruso could have pulled this off but it didn't last long even with them.  You REALLY want to like this opera, but in trying to write a ""modern"" very orchestra-rich piece it just doesn't have the right feel for the material.  There's never been a satisfactory recording (whatever medium) of this thing and most likely never will be!  I find, of the visual ones, this one does it best - which is why the 4 stars...  I could go on picking the various parts of it, and performances, to pieces, but that wouldn't be fair.  It's still ok once in awhile if only to say ""...but what if...""",1310342400,,909,4.445783132530121
8001168,4,B0000DI877,"Puccini's La Fanciulla Del West must have a great cast, in order to bring out the depth of characterizations and musical values, as prescribed by Puccini and his librettist. Placido Domingo and Carol Neblett shine in this production from the Royal Opera. The rest of the cast are all well- suited to their roles. Maestro Santi has a reputation for being a formidable Italian conductor! The production is great. I'm spoiled by today's High-Definition format, so my only reservation is the picture quality. This production is from a number of years ago. All in all,this is a good product and should be in any operaficionado's collection!",1300492800,3,635,5.0
8001169,2,B0000DI877,"This Fanciulla suffers from Girl problems, conductor problems, and Act I problems. First, I do not care for the Minnie. Her upper register is shrill, and she lacks charisma. For Fanciulla to be successful, one needs a Minnie with presence vocally and dramatically. I mean after all, she can disarm an angry miner, make the cruel sheriff back down, and save a varmint from a lynch mob. You just cannot be a drab stage presece and pull this off.

Domingo is in good voice, dramatically fine, and at that age had movie star good looks. Carolli is bland but unoffensive as Rance. The first act conducting is slow and tedious and robs this wonderful score of its vitality. Acts 2 and 3 improve somewhat. The sets are Covent Garden grand. Even those not bothered by political incorrectness will find the portrayal of the Indians offensive.

For those new to this wonderful but lesser know piece, I feel its charms can be better encountered elsewhere. I liked the La Scala DVD with Zampiere, Domingo, and Pons. The two characters not in common with this set are far superior as is the conducting by Maazel. On CD, try Tebaldi, Del Monaco, and McNeill--it earns its Penguin rosette",1270944000,,1173,4.717073170731707
8001170,3,B0000DI877,"This is my favorite Puccini opera, hands down. Very melodic, fantastic themes that truly support the drama. It works as a continuous most complete score from beginning to end with voices woven into the orchestra. In fact, probably my most favorite opera, genius on the part of Puccini. I was fortuante enough to attend the Met production with Milnes, Domingo, and Daniels. Domingo's incredible affinity for the role comes through and makes all of his efforts, seemingly effortless, passionate and beautiful to hear and watch. Neblett really is unfortunately miscast as she is too old looking, too big relative to Domingo, and while makes a valiant vocal effort, drops diction. Her acting is not convincing, and jestural, not impassioned, somewhat tired. She would probably be great in a concert version. She has a lovely voice even though she takes musical liberties. Carroli is one dimensional as Rance. He is very stiff in his acting, rediculous in his giant fur coat, and almost asleep for his first act aria. Milnes acts the role very convincingly even if his voice was past its prime and mannered in the Met production.
Domingo's performance is here is just a warm-up exercises for the incredible phrasing and unmatched musicality that he dilivers in his Met performance. I pity any tenor trying to attempt this role after Domingo. I suspect Puccini would be thrilled with with Domingo's Ramirez. Barbara Daniels is fantastic as Minnie. Completely natural and free and young, and in fantastic voice (Met Production). The set was weak and flimsy. The tree in Minnie's cabin rattled. The British should just not do westerns. Santi conducts predictably but does not hold the chorus, orchestra and principals together, this likely due to the language barrier. Slatkin does an amazing job of tieing everything together (Met). The British chorus doesnt pull off the western saying naturally and the action is mannered and piecemeal. The Met bar scene is amazingly like an old western film.  I have not yet seen the La Scala film, but will soon.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-La-Fanciulla-del-West-Daniels-Domingo-Milnes-Croft-Laciura-Fitch-Slatkin-Metropolitan-Opera/dp/B000787X0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini - La Fanciulla del West / Daniels, Domingo, Milnes, Croft, Laciura, Fitch, Slatkin, Metropolitan Opera</a>",1255564800,,2374,5.649859943977591
8001171,4,B0000DI877,"Fanciulla should be lively....rugged men, perky young gal.... but Neblett acts like a 40 year old school marm and is not helped by the ponderously slow tempi.  This ain't Wagner!!  Phrases that should bounce and sparkle are more like dirges.  Domingo is ordinary as usual, but sings a bit better here than in the Met production.  I usually like Carolli, but not so much here.......rather stiff and one dimensional.

So why did I give 4 stars.........the sets and costumes are fantastic.  Altho Minnie's cabin has elaborate china and stuff you would never expect in a wilderness cabin.",1246492800,,584,4.969072164948454
