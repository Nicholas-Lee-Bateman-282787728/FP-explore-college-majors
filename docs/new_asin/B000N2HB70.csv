2752671,5,B000N2HB70,"This DVD is very nicely done. It is excellently produced, has decent music, good sound, a nice contrast between the white gis and the blue background, and outstanding camera angles so that viewers can easily tell what is going on. Burrese's instructions are clear, straightforward, and precise, making it easy to understand all the important points. The pacing is good too; just the right amount of explanation before each demonstration so that you will know what is going on but not be bored. These demonstrations take place at a variety of speeds from slow to fast so that viewers can get a good flavor of what it might be like to actually perform each technique.

The material is logically organized from simple to complex. It begins by describing the elbow and how to best attack it and then moves on to cover basic arm bars, variations to these basics, arm bars from escort positions (common to law enforcement and security applications), step under arm bars, arm breaks, crossed arms, armpit clamp, and ground fighting. Most importantly, all the important principles that make these techniques succeed are clearly explained so that you can apply them to any lock in any martial art, not only those demonstrated here. These include such things as getting off line, blocking, trapping, spinning, striking, using your whole body weight, taking an opponent's energy, and other factors that can help stop an opponent's follow-on technique(s) while simultaneously facilitating your ability to execute the techniques successfully. Viewers will understand the angle, direction, distance, and proper finish of each application well enough to be able to troubleshoot the techniques when you practice them with a partner.

While most practitioners think of arm bars as defensive techniques, I really like how these applications are demonstrated both defensively and offensively. They are shown from a variety of starting positions including from grabs and punches. The add-ons such as kicks, punches, using ""found"" objects like parked cars or walls, and finishing techniques add a nice progression to apply appropriate levels of force for controlling an opponent, causing pain, or damaging an adversary.

Burrese moves well, explains clearly, demonstrates effectively, and ensures that viewers truly understand the materials. While no DVD is a substitute for hands-on instruction, this one is so good that it's the next best thing to being there. This is solid, practical instruction. I am confident that the rest of the series is equally outstanding as well. Highly recommended!

2752672,5,B000N2HB70,"One of the first things that jumped out at me from the onset when I started watching Alain's ""Lock On"" series of DVD's was the simple yet effective approach that he took in the production and presentation of this series of DVD's. My initial impression was one of being in an actual seminar environment while Alain was teaching instead of merely watching an instructional DVD. You won't find any pointless or ineffective ""bells and whistles"" with this series; instead what you will find is good quality instruction covering a wide array of joint locking techniques. This particular DVD focuses on arm bars and elbow locking techniques.

Alain's ability to instruct you on these simple, yet effective arm bars and elbow locking techniques is the hallmark of a good instructor and it certainly shows in this series. Alain's approach is straightforward and easy to follow as he takes you through each arm bar and elbow lock numerous times in order to teach you how to execute each technique correctly. Alain takes great care in his teachings to explain to you how some of these techniques, although they may appear to be ineffective, can actually be quite effective if applied under the right set of circumstances.

I'm going to take a brief moment here to jump ahead to the end of this DVD where Alain explains the three (3) key elements that need to be present in order for these techniques to be effective. Although each one of these key elements is vitally important in their own right, none of them is exclusive in importance to the others when it comes to applying these arm bars and elbow locks effectively in a combat or self-defense situation. What you have to remember is that these three (3) key elements have to be combined in order to form a symbiotic entity that is only effective when utilized together in an efficient manner.

These three (3) key elements are as follows:

1. Surprise: If your opponent doesn't know what to expect, he is going to have a more difficult time defending against it. However, if your opponent knows what is coming, he is going to be more readily able to counter it, or avoid it all together.

2. Speed: Executing the techniques shown on this DVD has to be done as fast as possible while still retaining the third key element, which is proper technique. If the technique is executed too slowly, then your opponent will have the opportunity to figure out what you are doing and, as in the case of surprise, be able to counter it or avoid the technique all together.

3. Proper Technique: This should literally be a ""no-brainer,"" but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. I don't know how many times I have personally seen or heard of someone trying to apply a particular technique in a given self-defense type situation when they weren't even executing the technique correctly to begin with. Alain goes to extreme lengths in this series to implore you to practice, practice, and practice, until the techniques he demonstrates become second nature to you where you can execute them correctly without thought or hesitation.

Alain follows the same instructional format for each one of the various arm bars and elbow locks shown in this DVD. He starts out by explaining some of the finer points of executing each technique followed by various follow up techniques that can be used on your opponent, if it is needed, after the arm bar or elbow lock has been applied. He then shows several variations of each arm bar or elbow lock that all are based on the primary techniques that were first shown.

Alain takes a very realistic approach to the use of arm bars and elbow locks and attempts to cover several influencing factors that may or may not come into play while attempting to apply them in a real life situation. I myself watched this DVD on three separate occasions and found something that I had previously missed each time. I have no doubt that were I to watch this DVD again after writing this review that I would find something else that I had previously missed.

One of the many great things that I really enjoy about Alain's teaching style is his, what I like to refer to as, ""nuggets of wisdom"" that he injects throughout his instruction process. I too use this in my own personal style of teaching and have found that it is very effective teaching technique.

I have a rather large collection of instructional videos that I have accumulate over the years and I can say without reservation that Alain's ""Lock On"" series is one of the best I have seen so far on the subject of joint techniques. If I were to have only one comment to make on this series, it would be this, ""Hurry up and make the rest of them!""",1176854400,7,4666,4.651699029126213
2752673,5,B000N2HB70,"One thing I've personally enjoyed about all of Burrese's body of work is his no-nonsense way of presentation. From Hard Won Wisdom to Hapkido Hoshinsul, From Street Fighting Essentials to the new Lock On Series, Burrese simply knows self defense.

I was excited to receive the evaluation copy of Master Burrese's new Lock On series of Hapkido Instructional DVDs. As usual, there was no let down.

Throughout, Burrese keeps safety in mind. He reminds the viewer that respect for one's training partner is key. Many instructors forget this point, which could cause problems during practice.

Another bonus of Burrese's work is that he packs as much information as possible into one DVD. Unlike other production companies which use fillers like promos for their other products, Burrese and Aiki Productions cram as much knowledge into each DVD as possible. As always, you get the biggest bang for your buck.

The Lock On Series isn't simply for the novice practitioner. Even the seasoned Hapkidoin will find great material here as well as a good reference source. The novice will find clear, precision instruction on basics, controlling and finishing techniques. The expert will find an invaluable reference on fundamental and advanced techniques and tweaks.

When watching Burrese in action, you'll notice his flow and control. Flowing, making a technique fluid and not choppy or hopping around trying to make it work, is essential in Hapkido. Burrese embodies that concept. He emphasizes proper footwork, an oft forgotten key, and whole body technique. He takes time to explain mechanics, a must for Hapkido.

This isn't a simple run-down of locking techniques. This IS a Master Instructor taking the time to show you step-by-step guidance towards mastery.

Kudos to Aiki Productions on clear video and audio quality. Audio quality is often lacking with many manufacturers. Aiki does an excellent job here with that as well as the graphical interface of the DVD.

2752674,5,B000N2HB70,"The second volume of ""Lock On"" focuses on ""Armbars and Elbow Techniques"" and follows a similar format to the first and has the same high production values and ease of access through its chaptering system.

This volume comes off as a bit quicker paced than the first and has more variations to these locks. Again the emphasis is not so much on all the myriad parts of Hapkido, but rather on these specific locks, and to a lesser extant, the footwork, strikes, positioning that go with the locks and their variations. This volume goes a bit deeper in this than the first one does and is very much ""concept"" based instead of rote technique based. It's clear that Mr. Burrese encourages experimentation and creative application of the techniques past the fundamental level of understanding.

The DVD runs a total of 83 minutes and starts off with a brief introduction and then an explanation/examination of the elbow joint. From there various locks are explored, including a basic (standing) Armbar, variations thereof (including some cool techniques using a knee to create the Armbar), Armbar Escorts, Step Under Armbars, Armbreaks, Crossed Arm (elbow) Techniques, Elbow Clamps, and some  very basic ""Ground Fighting"" (really just a few finishing techniques on the ground). For each category, the basic lock is explored in a fairly static sense and in a dynamic sense. From there, helpful and clear pointers are added and then variations in footwork and positioning are added. Various situations are shown, ranging from same side wrist grabs and punch defenses to using it offensively.

During the narration, Mr. Burrese adds in notations on effectiveness for self defense or for demonstrations, making it clear that some techniques are more for show and others aren't. He makes several references to levels of force and although he never goes into a great depth on it does give enough information for experienced practitioners to pick up on and understand. He is also very clear about showing that these are just one small element of Hapkido and that including the strikes, falls, breathing and other elements of the curriculum are necessary to understand and learn the art as a whole.

As an instructor, this is an excellent reference DVD. His clear narration and obvious experience provides a great model to follow when teaching and puts words to a lot of the ""little tips"" you show and teach but maybe never really explained verbally (I love how he handled the whole ""anchoring"" concept). This is truly an ""instructional"" DVD instead of a demonstration one. The focus is on teaching the material and providing ways to take the concepts and run with them.

For a student learning Hapkido, especially one that plans to someday instruct, this is a very valuable resource and well worth the money. I'd rather see someone buy high quality instructional DVDs like this set instead of having to buy lots of cheaper ones and try to get past the ""demo"" flavor and self-promotion that is often seen. I heard there may be a few more in the set covering other locks, I'll be happy to buy them and will appreciate them in my collection.

Overall, high quality instructional DVD that I highly recommend to students and instructors alike.",1173312000,4,3224,4.948243992606285

8174016,5,B000N2HB70,"The ""Lock On"" DVD set by Alain Burrese is my favorite instructional joint locking video set that I own or have seen (I have seen over 200 instructional martial arts videos)! My personal favorites are volumes one and two, but all the volumes are superb! The verbal instruction is easy to follow and understand, as Alain speaks slowly and clearly and has obviously prepared well for these instructional videos. The physical techniques are shown both slowly while explaining all the details that make it effective, and at real speed to show how it should look when done for real.
It is obvious that Alain is an expert in joint locking techniques, and no wonder when you consider his background: 4th degree black belt in Hapkido and experience working security as a security officer!
""Never grab a Hapkido person"", (mentioned in volume two) I love that phrase and Alain's excellent instruction and techniques motivate me to start training in Hapkido again!
I highly recommend the Lock On DVD set by Alain Burrese for anyone wanting to learn effective joint locking techniques!

8174017,5,B000N2HB70,"Lock On, Joint Locking Essentials, The Comprehensive guide to Joint Locks Volume 2; Arm bars & Elbow Locks.

This excellent DVD is produced by self-defence and Hapkido Expert Alain Burrese is the second  volume in a series of DVD's about joint locks.

Just like in Volume one, the DVD starts off with an intro with Alain explaining the scope and focus of this DVD namely arm bars and elbow locks.  So the focus is about the elbow joint and the viewer is shown how to either lock the joint or break the joint in a more serious situation.  Again the capacity of one DVD makes impossible to show every existing elbow lock and arm bar.  However he will show the basics as well as some variations providing an insight to why it works and  the principles of these locks.  With this the viewer can go away and create his own variations and applications.

Next Alain moves into the anatomy of the elbow and how we with this knowledge can inflict pain and or exercise control over the opponent.

With this understanding Alain moves into the techniques, starting with the basic arm bar.  The attack is a static same side wrist grab.  This to be able to explain and make the principles clear.  Alain explains every detail which is vital to make it work as well as little tips which make it easier to pull of against bigger and stronger opponents.

Once the basics are shown Alain moves into variations of the attack still applying this basic arm bar.

Gradually he adds stuff like the use of kicks and the environment which makes it all the more interesting.  Whereas many martial arts work from a defensive mind-set Alain also shows how to use the arm-bar offensively by going first.

All these variations help to gain a deeper understanding about how the technique works which enables the viewer to apply the technique to a variety of situations as well as invent their own technique.

From the basic arm bar Alain moves into the step under arm-bar, arm-breaks and crossed arms and the armpit clamp while using the same clear from basic to advanced variation structure.

There is even a short section about how to apply it during a ground fight which shows the same principles can but used in many environments and situations.

To conclude Alain repeats the three main principles of joint locks which have to be present to make them work and states that joint locks are a part of the toolbox and the viewer shouldn't ignore the rest.  He also explains that there is a time and place for the joint locks and they should be only attempted when the opportunity arises.

Again Alain provided a valuable piece of work here.  Just like the first volume the DVD provided new insights and a deeper understanding, even though many techniques are similar to aikido.
I would like to recommend this DVD to everyone interested in arm bars and elbow locks!",1368748800,,2833,4.622
8174018,5,B000N2HB70,"Alain Burrese shows a variety of arm locks with great skill and flair. The pacing of the DVD is perfect, with basic demonstrations first, followed by the small details that often make the difference between a technique working really well and not so well.

Burrese brings his considerable experience to bear in dealing with a variety of offensive movements, from punches to grabs, and even works from the clinch and the ground. An expert presenter, he includes general principles, body mechanics and evasive movements to create a very complete view of the subject.

Burrese is professional instructor in conflict resolution, and it shows. He offers well-considered graduated responses depending on the level of threat, everything from limb-breaks to simple control and restraint.

The techniques in `Lock On: Joint Locking Essentials' come from Hapkido, and include some interesting uses of the legs from a standing position. However most of the techniques are common to other grappling arts and this presentation will certainly benefit practitioners from all styles.

Both this DVD and Alain Burrese's work in general are highly recommended.

8174019,5,B000N2HB70,"Lock On

I recently received the Alain Burrese DVD "" Lock On, Joint Locking Essentials, Arm Bars and Elbow Locks (produced by Aiki Productions). I have purchased many Martial Arts and Self Defense videos over the years and more times than not I have felt that I was watching Kung Fu cinema on a Saturday morning as a kid. I was more than pleasantly surprised though when I began to watch at the extremely high production quality of the video. Sound was excellent and the video was shot in high resolution so no complaints there.

 I began to watch in earnest an found Mr. Burrese's teaching style to be spot on and enjoyable. He is a long time Hapkido student and teacher and it comes through in his explanations of how and why a certain technique works, but also when and where to use it. This is one of my biggest complaints about these types of instructional videos, the teacher simply states this is what to do and never gives any reason or explanation of why. Not once did I see this in Mr. Burrese's teaching. His explanations and easy teaching style came through like a bright ray of sunshine on a murky day.

 I am not a martial artist but have spent the past 22 years working as a bouncer in some of the roughest bars in Texas. I have used similar techniques in dealing with drunk's, drug addicts and bad guys for a long time. Mr. Burrese opened my eyes to a whole new realm of control and minimum force applications when dealing with the public. I can really appreciate the way Mr. Burrese breaks down each and every application into a usable and versatile technique.

 I also found as I watched the Mr. Burrese took the time to show techniques and methods from various situations, from the dojo, to tournaments, to the streets. This is one of my main complaints about these types of videos. What works in a controlled setting of a dojo or a tournament doesn't always apply to a survival or self defense situation. Mr Burrese takes the time and the responsability to show the viewer of different levels and styles what does and doesn't work and when and when not to use them. All in all I found this to be one of the best overall martial arts videos that I have ever bought and would recommend it for everyone interested in bringing their A game.
