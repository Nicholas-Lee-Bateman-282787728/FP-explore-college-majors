4910584,3,B005ZHBDTK,"I will start by saying that, silly me, I confused ""Devil's Men"" with equally odd (if memory serves) ""Incense for the Damned"" aka ""Bloodsuckers"" also with Cushing. So that was one disapointment. The other is that, with the best will in the world, I cannot be as enthusiastic about these 2 films as some of my fellow reviewers. Take ""Devil's Men"" first...It is basically a Greek film with Greek Crew and ""actors"" with the weirdest performences from Cushing (who sadly looks so ill) and Pleasance (whose ""Oirish"" accent definitley comes and goes), both actors that I admire and like greatly, but even they cannot make anything of the script which is awful. The direction, by Costa Carayiannis, is virtually non exsistant so much so that I fast forwarded several times. It says ""Uncut"" proudly but I can't help wondering what the U/K censor would have wanted to cut. The dubbing is bad but I will say the print here isn't too bad. The greek scenery is lovely, the girls are pretty and the only other English actor Luan Peters tries hard. Cushing is good, and does his best as he always does, with what he is given, but the Greek actors are all bad including the ""hero"" who is as thick a hero as I have seen for a long time... TERRROR the 2nd film is directed by Brit Norman J Warren, and is, for my money, just about the better of the 2. Again poorly acted (Whois/was John Nolan?), but at least it has a bit of life and some surpringly well attempted shock/horror moments, but done on a small budget they don't work too well. The print here isn't bad but I suspect the original wasn't too hot. NOW Here's a thought. All reviews are obviously subjective and you will see I am kind of in the minority (Just), so, if you are  horror fan and like to seek out the obscure...the price is good, it's a Double Bill, you have Katarina to look at (the intros aren't bad), so..Take the proverbial chance. You haven't much to lose, and you make think my opinions are rubbish...and who knows....",1350518400,21,1978,4.4944444444444445
4910585,3,B005ZHBDTK,"""The Devil's Men"" has been out for years under the title ""Land Of The Minotaur"". Although, this new release is proported to be the ""uncut"" version. We shall see.",1343433600,2,161,4.586206896551724
4910586,5,B005ZHBDTK,"Although there is little for bonus material, you get 2 decent movies and some fun hosting out of Katarina.  These dvd's are really good and it is nice to see something like this come along.  The extra care that is given to these releases makes them worth buying.  Most really do offer you behind the scenes and interviews/commentaries (except when the cast is dead)  they also offer uncut versions and clear picture, unlike some other bare bone releases by other horror hosts...",1338249600,17,478,4.7926829268292686
4910587,5,B005ZHBDTK,Both movies ROCK!!! The Devil's Men is about a cult of evil doers who worship a Minotaur (a Satanistic statue). The leader of the cult is Peter Cushing. His arch nemesis is Donald Pleasence who plays a weary priest. Some greek guy aids Donald Pleasence against the evil doers who are on a mission to sacrifice the young swingers on a town. This movie is surprisingly cool. This is the first time this movie is available on dvd and after seeing it I was wondering why it took so long for an official albeit double feature release. It was made in 1977. A year before big D made one of the ultimate horror flicks of all time in Halloween. This movie was evenly paced and very interesting. I love Peter Cushing. He is the most polite villain ever all while cutting your jugular at the same time. The next movie is Terror. It was first released years ago on a double feature along with Satan's Slave. This movie is very awesome with really good kills and a fun knife through the foot scene. All the kills are good and it is a 70's slasher that was ahead of the 80's slasher onslaught. It is from 1978. Damn good movie if I do say so myself. This is about the cheapest Katarina/Scorpion release there is and these are probably the two best movies released by that company. So I say go for it. You definitely get your money's worth and a whole lot more.,1332374400,37,1346,4.324110671936759
8489664,3,B005ZHBDTK,"1978's Terror concerns a movie producer whose family was cursed by a witch burned at the stake 300 years earlier.  To call Terror a poor man's Susperia would be giving it way too much credit but pretty much every idea director Norman J Warren has about staging violence (as well as many of the music and visual cues) are cribbed from the classic Dario Argento film.  Warren does such a poor job casual viewers are unlikely to make the connection but if you watch Susperia and Terror back to back the many lifts are obvious and sometimes amusing.  Terror isn't a good movie in any normal sense of the word but it is kind of fun if you're in the mood for schlocky 1970's horror.

The Devil's Men from 1976 is an occult film that isn't as much fun as Terror but it's probably more respectable since it features horror legends Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasence.  It was an attempt by Greek producers and a veteran Greek film director to ape the British horror movies of Hammer and Tigon but it came out at least 5 years too late.  The Devil's Men takes place in Greece for obvious reasons and is relatively atmospheric but otherwise pretty dull.

Both of these films were released theatrically in the United States by Crown International, a company that was very rarely associated with quality.  I went to their movies regularly as a kid so this double feature definitely brings back memories.  But if you haven't already seen these movies you probably want to keep your expectations low.",1525737600,,1485,4.61596958174905

8489667,5,B005ZHBDTK,"I have the Gorehouse Greats collection version of Terror, which was released in 2009. Pretty good movie, especially if considered a late night horror genre. It works great there. Quite a well done low budget flick. It wasn't boring at any part. This is one of those family curse movies where a witch has been burned at the stake and has cursed the male lineage of her executors, there have been a few of these over the years, good ones, and this is yet another one. After the witch burning, the movie flashes ahead to the modern era and the last two descendents of the old family still alive, and what becomes of them (a brother and sister), and their friends. The friends get it first, for some reason, then the siblings. Well done slayings too, not gory but believable. This is a good enough movie I wouldn't be surprised to see it have it's own remaster and release.",1435881600,,869,4.471698113207547

8489670,4,B005ZHBDTK,"Glad there's finally an uncut version of Land of The Minotaur aka Devil's Men available for American audiences, although why it was originally cut to a PG rating is still confounding.  It's not a classic but it is enjoyable especially if you like Donald Pleasence & or Peter Cushing.  As for Terror, it's a mostly strong film with some fairly grisly effects and some ""Poltergeist"" like moments too.",1396137600,2,398,4.838235294117647
