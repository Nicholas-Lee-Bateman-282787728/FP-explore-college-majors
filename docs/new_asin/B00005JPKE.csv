1599420,5,B00005JPKE,"The second installment of Clint Eastwood's epic Pacific Theatre movies, `Letters from Iwo Jima' is just as grand as `Flags of Our Fathers,' but the understated scenes create a more poignant atmosphere that resonates more powerfully throughout the whole movie.  No where does the movie try to take sides.  I didn't watch this movie telling myself, `I didn't know the Americans were so savage.'  That's not really the point.  Eastwood and screenwriter take the position of individual Japanese participants without any thought of the Axis.  What they do is show how war sweeps up decent, ordinary people in its bloody grips.  There are corresponding battle scenes that work well in both movies.  This time we see it from the Japanese angle.  The graphic battle scenes surely don't hide the brutal affair that war truly becomes.

The point-of-view is from a sympathetic Japanese soldier, Capt. Kirbashi (Ken Wanabe), who has visited America during a time that both sides couldn't conceive of war between the two countries.  He has pleasant encounters, but a telling scene shows comraderie with an American soldier who honors him in the States.  He indicates that a true soldier puts his country first.  However, later even he will offer a dying American soldier a nearly deplete portion of morphine.  (How much of a measure was that the usual course, I doubt, from either side.)  Another focus is for two young soldiers.  They, like many of their peers, believe their fate is marked on the island.  Their commander, Lt. Ito, is a nasty superior who always browbeats and actually once beats one with a cane for showing, allegedly, a lack of patriotism.  He is the arm of most Japanese sentiment.  Being men of honor, they are willing to commit suicide, rather than face dishonor.  One of them was discharged earlier for not having shot a dog on order.  We see how the Japanese operations work as government officials break up a reluctant young Japanese couple with a newborn.  ""Congratulations!"" the woman official exclaims.  It is a nice reminder of how people are often at mercy in the world of their own governments and circumstances beyond their control.

I asked myself, considering myself a patriotic American, why I liked  `Letters from Iwo Jima' better than `Flags of Our Fathers'.  I believe, although excellent, 'Flags of Our Fathers' doesn't try to get bogged down with some trivia pursuit it took with the participants in the photo flag-raising.  'Letters from Iwo Jima' sees all of us as potential victims falling into the vortex of war, even on a bloody, desolate rock island in the middle of the Pacific.",1169164800,,2614,4.9380733944954125
1599421,4,B00005JPKE,"Austere, reverent, documentary-like in its depiction of the Japanese attempt to defend Iwo Jima at the end of WW2, Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" never quite achieves the greatness that his earlier companion WW2 piece. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" attains though its pleasures are many.
This film stars the great Japanese star, Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi sent by the powers-that-be to Iwo Jima to take charge of a mission that is doomed in that, at this point in the war, the Japanese fleet has been destroyed and no help is available to Kuribayashi and his meager, barely trained troops. General Kuribayashi is in Iwo Jima then to serve Japan and to die with honor. Watanabe's Kuribayashi goes about his desperate project with the zeal and fervor of a man, though he is well aware of the inevitable outcome, who cares nothing about saving his own hide but only that of his soldiers: he is caring, loving, intelligent and exceedingly world weary. This is a nuanced and emotionally available performance by Watanabe.
""LFIJ"" is filmed in Japanese and told from the Japanese point of view and frankly it feels a little strange rooting for this rag-tag group of officers and soldiers particularly since the USA is the ""enemy.""  Eastwood's point of view then is finely tuned with a deep sense of respect for the Japanese yet I can't help feeling that Eastwood is stacking the deck here by not mentioning and/or ignoring the many atrocities that the Japanese perpetrated on China and others during this same period.
Filmed in sepia tones with splashes of color, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is beautifully filmed by Tom Stern and ultimately it is a deeply affecting and thoughtful depiction of men at war: some filled with duty and honored to be there and others merely fulfilling their conscriptions.",1169078400,2,1803,4.911475409836066
1599422,3,B00005JPKE,"There's no denying that this is an extremely well made film, visually compelling and powerfully acted, with a strong anti-war message. Just having seen it, however, I am concerned that it continues a recent trend of revisionist history towards World War II, one of the few wars in history with objectively good/bad, right/wrong sides. The fact is that the Japanese military instigated the Pacific conflict and committed unspeakable atrocities against the enemy and violations of the rules of war throughout. Yet one finds no mention of this in Eastwood's film, which appears to suggest a moral equivalency between the Japanese and American forces. (Indeed, the most egregious act depicted in the movie -- the shooting of unarmed, surrendered soldiers -- is committed by the Americans.) I have no quarrel with the message that war is hell for soldiers on both sides and that they share a common bond in the families they leave behind.  But that message would be better suited to a more morally ambiguous conflict, of which the past and present provide far too many. I fear that young audiences seeing this film without an understanding of WWII history and with only the experience of modern American military imperialism will perceive the undersupported Japanese forces as heroic and honorable resistors of superior Western might, instead of the barbaric and ruthless invaders that they in fact were from 1941 to 1945. One has to wonder if the critics would fawn over the film as much if we were being asked instead to sympathize with the soldiers in Hitler's SS, who I'm sure also had mothers who wanted them to come home safely.",1169078400,18,1629,4.967032967032967

1599591,5,B00005JPKE,"RELEASED IN 2006 and directed by Clint Eastwood, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" chronicles The Battle of Iwo Jima, which took place February 19March 26, 1945. Of the approximately 21,000 Japanese entrenched on the island about 18,000 died either from fighting or by ritual suicide. Only 216 were captured during the battle, but close to 3,000 were later found hiding in the caves & tunnels.

While this is an American-Japanese co-production, it was written by Japanese and the main cast is entirely Japanese (e.g. Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya, Tsuyoshi Ihara, Ryo Kase, etc.). Bitter critics complained that the movie is sympathetic toward the Japanese and their stubborn emperor worship. While its true that the movie does humanize them despite their renowned brutality during the war, it potently shows the folly of worshipping the martial state and the inevitable ramifications (doom).

In theory, Japans government was a constitutional monarchy during WWII but, in fact, it was a military junta (dictatorship) and therefore totalitarian in nature. The movie effectively shows the harebrained ideology of government-worship and the corresponding misguided honor of sacrificing oneself for the malevolent goals of said government. What a waste!

Letters from Iwo Jima also powerfully details the American threat to the remote isle and its militants. Put simply, these boys came to kick total axx. Their aim was to bomb/shoot/whatever first and ask questions later. If I were there I wouldve done the same because the Japanese made it clear that this was a fight to the death. Im actually surprised at how many Japanese POWs were taken (216 but, like I said, almost 3000 were eventually found in the caves & tunnels). By contrast, only 2 Marines were captured by the Japanese, but they died of their wounds while captive.

The first 44 minutes are a set-up wherein the characters and their desperate situation on the isle are established before the action starts. From there it gets seriously brutal and increasingly dismal till the climax. For balance, be sure to see Eastwoods companion piece Flags of Our Fathers, which debuted two months prior.

THE MOVIE RUNS 141 minutes and was shot in Barstow & Bakersfield, California, with establishing shots of Iwo Jima. WRITERS: Iris Yamashita (and Paul Haggis) from the books by Tadamichi Kuribayashi & Tsuyoko Yoshido.

1599682,5,B00005JPKE,"Once when I was doing some research on Japanese war medals I came across this unexpected fact:  in 2009 Clint Eastwood was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (3rd Class), bestowed by Japans Emperor Akihito. My immediate reaction was, Huh? What was that all about?

Turns out Eastwood was being honored for his highly regarded film, Letters From Iwo Jima (2006), which he directed - and co-produced with Steven Spielberg and Robert Lorenz.  It seems that way back in 1875 Japans Meiji government created the Rising Sun medal to recognize exemplary deeds, whether military or civilian.

But the 1945 Iwo Jima battle was a devastating defeat for Japan. So why would a Japanese emperor honor Eastwood for creating a film which proved the point?

Some background.

Iwo Jima is an island in the western Pacific located 760 miles southeast of Tokyo. Its tiny - measuring only about 8 square miles. Iwos distinguishing natural features are its black volcanic sand and Mt. Suribachi, a small mountain which played a pivotal role in the Japanese defense plan. The horrific battle for which the island will forever be known was fought from Feb 19 to Mar 26, 1945.  During those 35 days of sheer hell 6800 Americans in the attacking force and most of the 21,000 Japanese defenders lost their lives.

America was determined to capture Iwo Jima. Japanese warplanes based there had been attacking American bombers on their round trip to the Japanese home islands, along with their bases in the Marianas. These attacks had to be dealt with. Also important, Iwo would provide an emergency air field for American bombers in distress. This was no incidental matter, as Iwos air field saved the lives of 24,000 American airmen according to one estimate.

Letters From Iwo Jima is based on actual letters from Japanese forces on Iwo to their families back home. Flashbacks to revealing incidents in their past play an equally important role. Excerpts from island commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi down to the lowliest soldier are incorporated in the script. These excerpts and flashbacks present the Japanese soldier in a completely different light from the typical Hollywood stereotype.

A great example is Kuribayashis letters, which reveal a dedicated husband and father - a gentle human being utterly unlike the ruthless warrior youd expect to command a desperate battle. One letter is written en route to his new command on Iwo.  Kuribayashi apologizes to his wife for not having had time to attend to the kitchen floor, and tells her the problem really should be addressed. This in the face of almost certain death in the impending battle, something Kuribayashi acknowledges when he tells his wife he is determined to give his life for his country.

Another example, this time by way of a flashback, comes from way down in the ranks. An Iwo soldier by the name of Shimizu recounts an experience involving his superior officer back home. They were patrolling a residential neighborhood together when they encounter a dog belonging to a mother and her two small children. The animal is barking behind a small fence adjacent to the familys residence. Sensing an opportunity to test Shimizus obedience the officer orders him to shoot the dog. It seems barking might disturb army communications in the area.

Shimizu has the dog taken out back. But decency prevails once Shimizu is out of the officers sight. He unholsters his gun and shoots into the air, hoping his pistols report will fool the officer. The story ends badly for both dog and Shimizu but the takeaway is more Shimizus humanity than his superiors want of it.

If you see this picture you will meet Saigo, another sympathetic, low-ranking soldier on Iwo. Saigo had been a humble baker back home in Japan. In another of the films many revealing flashbacks the local draft committee shows up at his door.  A draft notice is thrust forward. Saigo is stunned. His pregnant wife Hanako is distraught.  A woman on the committee who seems in charge is furious at their reaction. Every family has given a husband or son to the cause. Hanako should welcome the prospect of her husband dying for the emperor. At least you will have a little one to carry on your name the woman says angrily, looking down at Hanakos belly.  Later when Hanako is alone with her husband she cannot let go her anguish:  None of the men ever come back she says with great emotion.

On Iwo Saigo is a nearly constant presence in the film. But victory isn't his purpose. Let the Americans have the island, he tells a buddy. Better than breaking your back digging trenches in the sand and digging caves out of volcanic rock. Saigos only goal is to come home alive - a solemn promise to his unborn child.

Saigo is one of the key characters in this picture. Another is Saigos unit commander, Captain Tanida. Tanida is contemptuous of Saigo, who he sees as unpatriotic and unfit.  Saigo's lack of interest in the war is transparent, and he cant shoot worth a damn. Early on we see Tanida beating Saigo for that unpatriotic comment about letting the Americans have Iwo without a fight. The beating stops only when Kuribayashi happens by and admonishes Tanida for beating soldiers when there are few enough as it is.  By much later in the film when the Japanese force on Iwo is all but annihilated top commander Kuribayashi has formed a bond with foot soldier Saigo. Several chance encounters explain this otherwise implausible development, which ends up saving Saigos life when Kuribayashi keeps him out of the final banzai charge.  If it had been up to Tanida, Saigo would have led the charge - with death certain.

These key characters play off each other right to the final scene. By films end each has become an archetype of his respective character.  Saigo is the innocent civilian drafted into a war he doesnt understand or believe in. Tanida is the consummate warrior, and Kuribayashi stands somewhere in the middle. More on them below.

From the Japanese governments perspective Clint Eastwoods medal was well deserved. His film dramatized letters that few would ever know about, and turned them into proof that not every Japanese soldier was a Hollywood-style monster. That, the government concluded, was a solid contribution to Japanese-American relations.

But was that the entire substance of Letters From Iwo Jima? Eastwoods film did show that there were Japanese soldiers on Iwo who did not fit the Hollywood stereotype. But the story is a little more complex than that. There is another flashback involving Kuribayashi, years earlier in California. We see him in full dress uniform as guest of honor at a military dinner party.  After friendly conversation and smiles all around the hosts wife shatters the bonhomie with a tricky question: what would Kuribayashi do if the United States and Japan ever went to war against each other? Would he follow his own convictions - or those of his country? ""Are they not the same""? was Kuribayashis immediate  reply. So theres another side to the loving husband and compassionate commander.

Kuribayashi's unexpected answer had been hard wired into Japanese warriors for over 800 years. It came straight from the samurai code of honor known in modern times as bushido, or way of the warrior. Loyalty, bravery, self-sacrifice (literally), and obedience to ones lord and master were its core.

For two millennia leading up to the 1940s Japans ultimate lord and master was the emperor, a divinity descended from the Sun goddess Amaterasu according to Japanese belief. Kuribayashis reply to his American friends at that dinner party reflected absolute loyalty and obedience to Emperor Hirohito, in whose name Japan fought the Pacific War.

In a different scene Kuribayashi provides another example of bushido. A subordinate officer questions his tunnel-digging strategy in the caves as futile. Kuribayashi is livid. Maybe so. Maybe the entire defense of Iwo is futile. Maybe the entire war is futile. But if the children back home in Japan can live in safety one more day its worth the sacrifice of every soldier on Iwo.

However, its clear that if the epic Pacific struggle produced samurai-like warriors Kuribayashi is not the best example. It is Captain Tanida who best fits that role. He is the unforgiving commander who would unsheathe his sword without hesitation and decapitate a soldier under his command for the slightest offense. In their day samurai could do the same, even with civilians. Tanida is most persuasive as samurai when he commits the classic act of seppuku (ritual suicide) after it is apparent Iwo is lost to the Americans. But he kills himself 20th century style - with a gun to the head instead of a blade in the belly.

Kuribayashi and Tanida each fulfill the bushido imperative of self-sacrifice differently. For Tanida the honorable way out was to die by his own hand. For Kuribayashi it was to die by way of an act which served the emperor in an identifiable way. That was accomplished when he led the final banzai charge, which at least held out the prospect of taking some of the enemy with him.

After Japans defeat on Iwo Jima it would have been clear to all but the most fanatical militarists that the war could not be won. It seemed Japans only hope of repelling the coming American invasion of the home islands (before anyone knew about the atomic bomb) was to turn its population into a suicidal kamikaze force. If vast numbers of civilians were willing to die for their emperor they might inflict unacceptably high casualties on American forces.  American public opinion might then compel an end to the Pacific War with Japan retaining its sovereignty.  But that was not to be.

In San Francisco on September 8,1951, six years after its surrender on the U.S. Battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, Japan signed a peace treaty with the United States and most of the Allied powers. There were a few holdouts, the most important of which was the former Soviet Union, now Russia. To this day Japan and Russia have not signed a treaty formally ending their state of belligerency in World War II.

Letters From Iwo Jima is a masterpiece. Acting and directing are brilliant. Casting is inspired, most particularly in the choice of Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo. There are bloody action scenes in this film but their purpose is clearly to advance our understanding of the characters.  Anyone with a general interest in World War II or who is interested in broadening his or her understanding of the Japanese soldier in that cataclysm should see this film. Highly recommended.",1501804800,6,10556,4.895179372197309

This film portrays the Japanese as human beings with human emotions, rather than unfeeling monsters as they are often portrayed in World War II films, especially ones that deal with Nanking.

A tale of a commander who led from the front...

1600252,5,B00005JPKE,"A very well done film as seen from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers defending Iwo Jima.  Clint Eastwood did a masterful job with this storyline and it carefully balances the struggle so many Japanese soldiers must have endured between facing certain death with no hope of winning.  I appreciated the personal narratives of several of the characters involving flashbacks to their lives prior to Iwo Jima.  As a Marine Corps combat veteran and one who has lived the infantry life, Iwo Jima holds a place of reverence among Marines everywhere.  This film simply gives the viewer a chance to see the terrible waste of human life that occurred there in February 1945.  The contrast of the Bushido code and the conflicting views of it among the Japanese is evident throughout the story, and it gives the viewer some appreciation for the hard life of an infantry soldier, whether that was the Marine Corps rifleman or the Japanese soldiers defending Iwo Jima.  Finally, the most powerful part of the story may be the scene where Japanese soldiers listen to one of their own read a deceased U.S. Marine's letter from his mother.  Two thumbs way up, Mr. Eastwood.",1453075200,4,1162,4.838383838383838

1600582,3,B00005JPKE,"Letters From Iwo Jima, 2007 film

Iwo Jima (Black Sand Island) was an island whose only importance was as a landing field for American B-29 bombers so they could fly to the main islands of Japan. This movie was made in Japan from the letters sent home by the soldiers stationed there. It has subtitles in English, reading them distracts from the story on the screen. The point of view is from the Japanese. Late in the movie there are scenes with Americans speaking. This is as much educational as entertaining, few know about these letters.

You will learn that defense forces (airplanes, ships) were taken from the Japanese troops to reinforce other areas. It was as if the Japanese High Command knew they could do nothing to help, defeat was only a matter of time. One officer said there would be no reinforcements as aircraft carriers and airplanes were sunk in the Battle of the Marianas. A new commander arrives to order their guns to be relocated back on the hills, away from the landing beaches. [A better defensive position?] Troops dug trenches and caves for protection against bombardment. Japanese soldiers were trained to die for the Emperor, who was worshipped like a god. Retreat or surrender were for cowards who did not deserve to live. Most of the Japanese troops died rather than surrender. The Kempei Tai were the secret police of the military, analogous to the Nazi SS.

This movie would be better if the voices were translated into English. The best movie is still The Sand of Iwo Jima which provides the outlook from the winning side.",1431475200,,1557,4.7380073800738005

Based on actual letters that were found within the island caves, we get a very detailed description of what went on during that 40 day siege that should have been over, in 2 days or less. This two-disc, special edition comes complete with special features that include: ""The Faces of Combat"", ""Images from the Frontlines"" and the November 2006 Press Conference and World Premiere in Tokyo. This 'Golden Globe' Winner and 'Best Picture' in a Foreign Language, is depicted in the Japanese language with English subtitles.

1600661,4,B00005JPKE,"Excellent perspective, but short on background and details. While Eisenhower breached Hitler's impenetrable wall on the Normandy coast in 24-hours, the battle of Iwo Jima, a 2-mile by 5-mile volcanic rock, took nearly 40 days, killing some 22,000 Japanese soldiers, all or whom were told they would die in the battle, and were instructed to kill at least 10 Americans before being killed.  U.S. forces suffered 26,000 American casualties - the only American invasion in history in which the U.S. suffered more casualties than the defending forces.
I think every young person should first watch the companion movie, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, for the American perspective, then LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA to understand the Japanese.  Clint Eastwood is among my favorites, however, he may have bit off more than can be adequately covered in one, or even two, 2-hour movies.  Good action movie, but short on why both sides were there.
To truly understand why and how the war in the Pacific became such a horrible meat-grinder, read Jim Brady's companion books - FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, and FLYBOYS.",1428624000,,1083,5.039106145251397

Nota bene: those who are interested will find a very good review of this film in Ian Buruma's most recent collection ""Theater of cruelty : art, film, and the shadows of war"".

Conversely, I can't overlook what the Japanese Empire's goals and especially their methods of trying to attain those goals were, as I lived during WWII as a young kid in the USA, with family members and neighbors fighting in that war.  It was a terrible event, I'm sure for everyone Axis or Allies, and this movie opens that door in an entertaining and moving way.

I was so surprised when I first saw it back in 2007, because Flags of Our Fathers was still riding a rocky road to nowhere. Letters from Iwo Jima was a masterpiece of irony, showing the war through the eyes of the enemy.

I'm not making any kind of statement about the war itself, just the fact that the 'enemy' is in essence no different in any war. Nobody wants to be there, but you are, so you do what you have to do to survive.",1405382400,,634,4.456896551724138

1601092,5,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood is a star in front of and behind the camera. As director, he deftly captured the physical and emotional struggles of the Japanese soldiers within a military culture seldom seen and even less understood by Americans. This was a battle the Japanese knew they would lose and yet saw the possibility of survival of their country and culture with their sacrifice. Only the advent of the Atomic Bomb destroyed the Japanese strategy of bleeding the American's will to continue its policy of unconditional surrender. This movie, made in conjunction with the American side of the battle shown in Flags of our Fathers, is a important historical work for a country now unwilling to accept any casualties.",1398124800,3,708,5.008474576271187

They (Japanese) were dedicated and determined fighters led by a truly outstanding strategist in Lt. Gen. Kuribayshi.  There are always two sides to every conflict.  From the strategic level to the tactical level it's the warriors, not the politicians who pay with their blood.  As a 34 year Marine Corps vet I can guarantee there is no one who has had serious ""trigger time"" that would not agree with the latter statement.

1601200,4,B00005JPKE,"As an American, most of the war stories that I watch are written and produced from an American or Occidental's perspective.  ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" breaks this narrow mold and presents war, culture, military tradition, and duty from a Japanese perspective.  The film's audio is in Japanese and the English subtitles are initially cumbersome.  Fortunately, ten to fifteen minutes into the film, astute viewers will be captivated by the story and, as a result, no longer dismayed by the subtitles.
Bottom Line:  This is an interesting, thought provoking story.  I wish that Japanese tactics were explained in greater detail.  I also wish that Japanese offensive thrusts were not all depicted as relatively inept and poorly planned.

Japan didn't treat their servicemen as royalty, even though they expected these same people to die by suicide if necessary in service of their Emperor.

I normally would not watch a movie in another language with subtitles, but this one really grabbed me and held onto me.  This battle happened years before I was born, but to see it through the eyes of the Japanese was very emotional.  The movie made it so personal, and I knew from history how it turned out, but was still hoping, for their sake, that they would not all die.  I don't choose to watch war movies, but if you have to watch just one, watch this one.  The guys on the other side are just like us.  I watched ""Flags of Our Fathers"" the day before I saw ""Letters from Iwo Jima,"" so saw both sides of the story - but this movie, Letters, was so much more gripping and sticking in the memory.

1601323,5,B00005JPKE,"I shop the DVD bargain-racks looking for good movies. Usually, the cost is  five dollars, sometimes less. I've found some really exceptional movies in this way. Tonight's choice was ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" directed by Clint Eastwood. It was just astounding! Well, there wasn't much risk. I've watched a ton of Eastwood movies and I've never seen one I rated as low as four stars. He's just that kind of actor or director. Every time. I vaguely remember Iwo Jima. It was near the end of WWII and I was in the third grade at the time. I don't remember anything about the battle, but there's that iconic photo of the soldiers raising the American flag that almost stands as a symbol for the entire WWII era.. Well, it was a real educational experience in watching this fine film. Trust me.

First of all, I was surprised that the film was all in Japanese and  required reading subtitles. That's rare in American films, but I think it was astonishingly effective in  delivering the total emotional impact of this particular film. I couldn't really figure out what was going on until almost halfway through the movie, until it finally settled in that we were with the Japanese as they were gradually recognizing that their forces were crumbling, defeat was inevitable and no help would be arriving to save them. The only thing to do was maintain honor. It  was grim. The Americans arrived with overwhelming numbers and firepower while the Japanese were holed up in caves and tunnels and running out of ammunition. As the Americans pressed ever closer, suicide became an ever more common exit. Some tried the escape and surrender route, but most of those were killed by their own men. Some managed to escape, but were killed by the Americans. War is grim, to say the least.

The depiction of war in this film is outstanding. The acting is excellent. throughout  the film. You feel as if you're actually there, even though all the spoken language is Japanese. You can read the captions, of course, but you can feel the story from the superb acting. The fighting and war scenes are grim and ultra realistic, not like the war scenes of the so-called action movies. This seems like the real thing and made me thankful that I've never been in a real wartime battle. Nice movie! Profound from every point of view! Spellbinding! Timeless! Don't miss it!

Oh, by the way, There's two discs to  this set and I haven't watched the second. I'll get around to it eventually.

1601324,2,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood is old as hell. He spent like 15 minutes at the 2012 Republican convention talking to a chair. He's dumb enough to consider himself a Republican in the first place.

This movie was made a few years before that speech. It is arthritic and childlike, like an old person's home.

But I'm going to start with the good. The good is the long-shots of the Iwo Jima volcanic landscape. The idea itself is great, as I've seen enough films from the American perspective. It is interesting seeing advancing American forces from the other perspective, because no one can beat the Americans.

Now for the bad. The bad is that the movie bends over backwards to depict the Japanese soldiers as noble and human. This is another culture, so there is a certain hand-off treatment that goes towards the Japanese, but the movie is much worse for it. The movie literally begins with like an Olympic horse galloping on Iwo Jima, and the Japanese play-acting the American invasion like a game of flag football. Everything is a little too clean, the soldiers are too quick to smile, they don't act like the hardened soldiers that they are. It feels like summer camp. Just small things, like how the clothes look immaculately dry-cleaned, there is an utter lack of a ""lived-in"" feel to it.

They have a humanitarian general leading them, who calls off any military discipline and readily calls for retreat. They have soldiers are martyrs for social consciousness and saving little puppy dogs. We see a Japanese officer literally calling for empathy for a wounded American, even while their morphine supplies are low. This feels like The Passion of the Japanese Christs.

When the American invasion starts, things get a little better. The Americans outnumber and outgun the Japanese. So there's a sense of a doomed cause. Since the movie is voiced in Japanese, hearing the enemy speaking familiar English is a neat effect on the viewer.

But then there are a number of inexplicable events. There is a gory suicide scene where a number of soldiers commit suicide by hugging hand grenades. This is completely nonsensical. The battle has only just started and they're already committing suicide? And if they want a warrior's death, wouldn't it make sense to go out guns blazing, charging American troops with the bayonet?

At least the ending is somewhat interesting. I haven't seen flag of our fathers, but I suspect that you see flag of our fathers characters in the final scene. It's structured so you see that the crazed Japanese soldier, attacking with a shovel American soldiers armed with guns, was the result of some honor for the dead thing.

What I thought was most missing from this movie was a strategic view. It could have been written to depict the Japanese planning out a series of traps for the Americans, and then executing those traps in a scrambling manner until the final Bonzai. That would have been interesting. It would have been fun. Instead, you get basically amateur hour, a boy scout troop being sent to war. It is strange how bad this movie is when there are so many good German movies about WWII. Downfall and Das Boot are far superior movies. I do have a nagging suspicion that the reason why the Japanese are so awful in this movie is that, compared to Germany, Japan has a much more limited military in the current day, and so there simply isn't as much military experience.

This is a pretty bad movie. Skip it.",1362268800,,3430,4.751260504201681

The production values are superb, including things like trying to light up a series of caves, scripting which makes events plausable and coherent and story-like (a beginning, middle and end), acting, cinematography, etc.

The story has pathos, and you care about the characters, their situations and the outcomes.

Director Eastwood meant to pair this movie with another he did, ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" which was the same saga told from the side of the American marines landing and taking Iwo Jima during WWII. This one is told from the point of view of the Japanese Army. Some of the scenes from one movie are replayed in the second movie so that a context is given for the scene in the first movie, told from the other side of the two stories. That works well and gives us a profound understanding of the motivations, emotions and sociology of the Iwo Jima battle. History does not repeat, it is said, but it does rhyme. There are lessons to be learned here about conflict at the human level, about the differences in culture and the similarities between the Japanese and the Americans (for instance, the roles of honor and pragmatism, about military culture, etc.).

It didn't make much money, and I am sad about that. It is frustrating to me that dregs of movies get plenty of play, but great movies can hardly make a splash. Clint Eastwood is a great filmmaker and this movie shows it.",1356307200,5,1569,4.572953736654804

- The special effects of the deaths in the battle field are vividly real.

For example, in one scene, a Japanese officer ordered his doctor to help a U.S. prisoner. In another scene, some U.S. killed 2 Japanese who surrendered to revenge their buddies' death.

- There are many extremely disturbing scenes depicting the fanatic of many Japanese officers and soldiers who prefer suicide to surrendering. In another scene, a soldier lying to his officer about shooting a barking dog and was savagely beaten.

1601447,5,B00005JPKE,"Like lots of America kids, I was raised on heroic tales of America's history in World War II. Its images, among them the iconic flag-raising at Iwo Jima, were forever seared into my imagination. Not to mention that I happened to grow up in the town that lays claim to Rene Gagnon, one of the flag-raisers!

I don't think it ever occurred to me that there was another side to the story, that of the faceless enemy that hid in caves and bunkers, lying in wait to slaughter our brave boys.

""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is director Client Eastwood's attempt to humanize the Japanese and show the fight from their side. The story focuses on General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) sho is unusual or a Japanese military man - he carefully plans the battle, with a clear-eyed assessment of the strengths and tactics of his enemy. That puts him at odds with many of his colleagues, who have no respect for the Americans as warriors and presume an easy victory over them. The rank and file are represented by Private First Class Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a family man and simple baker placed in the crosshairs of history. Saigo's open and expressive face makes him the perfect antithesis to the dehumanized and faceless ""Jap"" that many of us grew up on. The film takes us from the preparations for the battle, the landing itself, the relentless pounding that the Japanese took rom air and sea and the desperate life living in tunnels clawed from the volcanic rock.

If anything, the film swings perhaps a bit too far toward defanging the Japanese. They are portrayed as poor grunts riven to work by a few obsessively crazed superiors. They empathize with wounded Americans. General Kuribayashi is often shown writing sad letters home to his family. Except for a few madly patriotic soldiers, most of the island's defenders just seem ready to go home. I hate to spoil the party, but Iwo's garrison had dug 11 miles of tunnels into rock. Perhaps not all were political fanatics, but it seems to me that it would take more than a half-hearted attempt to accomplish that feat!

Nonetheless, ""Letters from Iwo Jim"" is a success, and gives a small taste of what the battle might have looked like from the other end of US Marine and Navy guns. A worthy companions to ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" Eastwood's companion piece from the American point of view.",1341705600,,2336,4.704156479217604

1601452,5,B00005JPKE,"This story will definitely bring reflection and challenge your beliefs if you grew up in the years after World War II where the common question among friends was, what did your dad do in the war? To us kids, the Germans were derisively called Krauts or Huns and the Japanese were Japs or Nips. It was a common frame of reference to look at your enemy as subhuman, as fanatical madmen that should be exterminated. Such thinking is essential to the fighting man who must kill and still be able to redeem his ego from the psychosis of guilt and nightmares.

Director Clint Eastwood presents something very much absent from war movies past, the humanization of our former enemies. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" brings the Japanese perspective of the lead-up to the invasion of that island and the invasion. It centers around three characters, Ken Watanabe portrays Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the commanding general of the island, Tsuyoshi Ihara plays a Japanese officer who was a gold medalist as an Olympic equestrian, and Kazunari Ninomiya who is Private Saigo, the most pathetic soldier and sympathetic character of all three, a young father-to-be who answers the knock on the door and is told ""Congratulations, you have been selected for the army,"" in a similar manner as Americans received their draft summons with the telegram that began with ""Greetings!"" His wife is chastised for crying at the news, as she is told it is a great honor to be chosen to die for his country. In one of the more poignant scenes, he tells his child in the womb that he is the daddy and promises to return home and see the child grow up.

The Japanese commander is an egalitarian leader who does not share the fanaticism of some of his officers. He doesn't believe in ritual suicide or senseless charges. His letters home, from Iwo Jima tell his story and we see flashbacks of his time in the United States where he learned the language and made bonds of friendship. His closest friend is the officer and medalist who shares the same view of war and what constitute honor.

The plot is the deprivation that Japanese suffered leading up the invasion, the endless preparation that created 11 miles of tunnels on Mt. Suribachi with ever dwindling provisions and replenishment and reinforcement that would never arrive. Soldiers question their military and cultural traditions that challenge them to die, when all they want to do is live and return to their homes and loved ones. Their turmoil is constant and we see it from the general to the lowest private. It's the turmoil of duty vs. the will to live.

The story ends with the a soldier burying the letters of his commander so they will not be found. The story begins with Japanese anthropologists unearthing the letters.

The splendor of this movie is its simplicity. It shows a minimum of color to reflect the deprivations and despair of the defenders.  The music is also muted, never overpowering adding its subtle sounds to a powerful script and images. The acting is superb and thankfully, the Japanese sound Japanese.  Clint Eastwood proves once again that he is a director to be taken seriously as the viewer cannot help but feel empathy for those who were once our most brutal foe. Eastwood also brings a strong message that in the brutality of war, soldiers of any uniform do not fight for their country, or their flag, or emperor. They fight for their closest comrades, their families and themselves. They fight to stay alive and stay whole physically and emotionally. On the island of Iwo Jima, many on both sides would never find either.

It is a forgotten honor to remember our veterans on Memorial Day, men and women who have given their lives or their souls for their society. This time I will also think about those I never would have included before, someone like General Kuribayashi, Olympic champion Baron Nishi, and Private Saigo.

Watch this film, and maybe you will understand why.

1601453,5,B00005JPKE,"A story about the WWII battle of Iwo Jima as seen from the Japanese side.  (A companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers, also created by Clint Eastwood.)  This is definitely not a movie that glorifies war, nor is it a movie that conveys a blatant anti-war message.  It is about honor as a value, a virtue, and about how a plot centering around honor, or doing right because it is right, plays out in the context of the culture of Japanese warriors at Iwo Jima.  It is also about suffering and sacrifice as virtues, whether in war or in any circumstance of human existence.  These values are seen juxtaposed here, at cross purposes, with the human desire to live and love and express compassion.  Even more than being about these general concepts, it's about specific characters who are fellow human beings with whom one can empathize and sympathize.  They are people with whom one can strongly identify; and ultimately, they are people one grows to love and care about very much.

Because the story involves spending a lot of time experiencing distress in battle and other wartime situations, the viewer undertakes to undergo extended unpleasantness, but to experience the story seems to me to be worth the stress because it has great ""redeeming value."" It can deeply touch the heart with love. It is a film that helps to put down enmity such as war typically magnifies.  It can serve to erase racial prejudice and hatred.

The Japanese actors were grateful to Eastwood for making the movie, giving a ""voice to the voiceless spirits"" of those Japanese who were involved in the actual battle at Iwo Jima.  The documentation about the making of the movie brings out the fact that the Japanese soldiers went into the battle of Iwo Jima knowing that they were going to their destruction.  The circumstances were such that they could not possibly win.  So, the viewer realizes that both in reality and in the film story, constantly uppermost in the minds and wills and hearts of these men must have been the need to hold firm to their cultural/religious concepts of death with honor.  The viewer has only to substitute in his imagination concepts from his own most heartfelt faith/culture/religion to feel a meaningful atonement in empathy with the characters of the story.  And of course, being able to identify with their desire to continue to live and love is only human and doesn't take a far stretch of the imagination.

This DVD packet includes an entire disc documenting various aspects of the making of the movie and I found this material just as interesting and worthwhile in its own way as the movie itself.

(A nice subtle touch at the finale of the film, after there's been a peculiar monotonal color scheme throughout, is the appearance of an actual warm-colored sun on the horizon [which is setting and/or rising].  Interesting irony to ponder after multiple scenarios throughout the film involving the sun iconography of the Japanese flag.)",1327795200,,2948,4.815476190476191
1601454,5,B00005JPKE,"Whereas Flags Of Our Fathers falls flat, Letters From Iwo Jima rises to become certainly a front-runner as one of the best war films ever. The main reason this movie works so well is the acting which is beyond first-rate and the way the characters are drawn in a fantastic script. There are some ""holy ____!"" moments especially one suicide scene and a ""flame-on"" of a soldier in another. The way the movie was shot also helps evokes the barrenness of the real Iwo Jima and the way the island was turned into scorched earth.

The extras are worthy of Oscar consideration as beyond the ubiquitous ""making of"" is a look at how they cast the film with the various Japanese actors' backgrounds and how they were chosen for their roles revealed. There is also thrown in the Japanese premiere and press conference which was a nice bonus touch (why don't more DVDs put those on their extras).

If you understand Japanese (the movie is subtitled in English), they have tried to accurately recreate the way the Japanese language was spoken and used back in 1945 but early on you'll hear one soldier refer to Americans as ""American"" rather than ""America-jin."" That was sort of odd.

Also, as a huge cultural insight into the Japanese psyche back then and comparing it to the way it is now will be endlessly fascinating to any person who has spent any length of time in Japan. I'll leave that at that otherwise I'm apt to go off on some social anthropological rant.

Anyway, on so many levels this movie works whether you're a fan of war movies or not.",1322956800,,1540,4.568840579710145

1601487,5,B00005JPKE,"""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is a film that provides a Japanese perspective regarding the WWII island battle, and works in partnership with ""Flags of Our Fathers"". It is rare that a viewer has an opportunity to consider multiple narratives regarding a war. Yet Director Clint Eastwood's excellent foresight allows the viewer to appreciate that the Japanese soldier had their own duty, and suffered immense casualties too.

1601488,2,B00005JPKE,"Eastwood had to wait till most of the World War 2 vets were dead before he could make this movie. The vets likely had no idea their Japanese adversaries were so sweet and considerate. Maybe Clint will rehab the Nazi SS next.

Otherwise the movie is an introspective navel-gazing pity party.",1313884800,3,290,4.686274509803922
1601489,5,B00005JPKE,"War is hell,of hat there is no doubt. We tend to malign our enemies maliciously during times of crisis/war. In this instance the Japanese were portrayed as small,bespectacled dirty fighters often referred to as Nips or Japs. The truth was the Japanese were indeed hard soldiers to contend with on the battlefield,stopping at very little to win the tiniest piece of ground,even to the extent of banzai or suicide charges(on the ground-kamikazes in the air).But to propagandize the public and sheer up support for the war machine(very necessary in times such as WW2)these kind of images helped to propel the US and the rest of the allies ever onward to ultimate victory.
Underneath the Japanese soldier lay....a human being like anyone else. Their Samurai code and service and discipline structures gave them an attitude which took the Western powers a while to get a handle on. When they finally did they took the fighting to the Japanese in their own style. 30,40 years ago,this movie would not have stood much of a chance of getting noticed or being accepted altogether. Memories of those that fought against them were still very much tender. Even today it is still tough for those that fought in such hell holes as Iwo Jima,to accept another or different side to that piece of battlefield history. It was a bold step on Eastwood's part to undertake its making,but undertake it he did and to much acclaim.
Letters from Iwo Jima(released in Dec/06) was the second release which dealt with that terrible battle. His first epic was Flags of our Fathers(told from the U.S. perspective),but personally I find this one much more compelling than the first. The story in ""Letters"" dealt with the small(in comparison)Japanese garrison ordered to hold the island at all costs. We see the day to day life amongst the troops and their struggle to survive on little hope,meager rations and a strict and unbending command structure. In fact what makes this movie work so well is the pall of the little hope this garrison has against the superior forces of the Americans. It is truly a miracle they accomplished and held out as much they did,as long as they did. We see the human but tragic side of the Japanese,a side we the Japanese antagonists have more often than not,just refused to see. Again it is a rational thought process as we,especially the soldiers themselves,would like to try and forget all the horrors that battle,as so many others of WW2,bring to mind. Many others would also say they got as good as good as they gave. Of that I cannot argue.
This movie stirs up those and a plethora of other emotions as you watch it,but Eastwood's camera doesn't dwell on any one thing too long. The movie does not take a side,it projects what it was like to be a Japanese soldier during the battle for Iwo Jima,and nothing more. Eastwood,remarkably and successfully,juggles a very controversial topic masterfully. If it had been handled any other way it would have been a disaster.
This two disc edition has been transferred beautifully and is clear and crisp in its original widescreen a/r. Extras are abundant and include:A featurette on the making of the movie,a look at the cast members and a clip from the 2006 premiere and press conference in Japan for the movie.
A highly recommended DVD for war buffs out there and for everyone else looking for good plain entertainment. The movie takes no sides and Eastwood and company gives a surprisingly accurate portrayal of the life of the Japanese soldier during one of the most bloodiest battles of the Pacific during WW2.",1305244800,,3561,4.829787234042553
1601490,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters From Iwo Jima is simply spectacular.  Better by far than Flags of Our Fathers,  Letters gives us a vivid look into the hopeless zealous of the Japanese military as they are lose the island of Iwo Jima, and the futility of their fight.  Their are two people the movie focuses on: Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi and his command of Jap forces on the island, and a young PVC named Saigo.  A soldier who wishes nothing more than to be home with his pregnant wife.

Many have called this an anti-war film due to the sympathy it gives to some of the Japanese soldiers, however it seemed to me that it showed two different types of people in any bad-guy military: the soldier who knows that he is fighting for the wrong side but does it anyway (Gen. Kuribayashi), and the other (Saigo  who decides to hell with this, and looks to be captured so that at least he has some chance of getting home.  This movie goes out to the few Japanese men who surrendered to the Allies, and to those who knew better.

This is now one of my favorite war dramas, and for those reluctant to see it due to all the press that it was an anti-war, anti-American movies, please give it a chance.  I did and I realized how wrong I was.

Both the mini-series and the included supplementary interviews with American veterans amply documented the fanatical, inhuman brutality that the Japanese forces exhibited throughout the war.

I'll bet every one of those veterans would bristle at the touchy-feely treatment given to the main characters in this film. While there may have been a few Japanese soldiers that acted with what we would consider humane and human reactions to conflict, this movie did a dis-service to history by not also explicitly documenting the maniacal attitude most of the Japanese were imbued with and the resulting atrocities they committed, both to the living and the dead.",1301961600,2,745,5.313559322033898

1601494,5,B00005JPKE,"From the moment I started this film, I was completely enthralled at the contrast between the normal men and the brutal military code that drove them during this hopeless battle.  Regarding the men, there are absolutely wonderful characters.  You have the fictional baker, a seemingly weak man whom the viewer believes will probably survive, who makes friends with a supposed Kempetai he could not trust; the fanatical sub-commanders who sometimes force their men to suicide; the general Kuribayashi, who saw further than his colleagues and had a wider vision of the world yet persisted in his duty to the end.

The most important thing for me was that I empathized so much with all of these men.  It may sound strange, but I lived in Japan and came away with an extremely negative view of its society, which enabled me over the last 20 years to take some pretty rigid stances about it.  In particular, I have felt so disgusted at the brutality of their behavior in China, which the Ministry of Education officially covers over (to this day portraying the Japanese as victims of the war), that I felt we were justified in the way we attacked them in the war and to make some blanket generalizations.  This film has gotten me to question my lack of sympathy for the Japanese who fought, even the misguided fanatics who killed their own men for nothing.  Yes, the Bushido code was twisted to the designs of a militaristic regime, but until now I have wondered how human their soldiers were.  This is the gift that only great art can bestow.

1601585,5,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima is an exceptional film. It has a meditative tone that artfully evokes the individual's existential experience of war. It reminded me of Malick's The Thin Red Line; futility, chaos, insanity, honor, all abundantly present, and visually beautiful. Between sepia and black & white coloring, the isolation and spareness of the Japanese fortification of Iwo Jima in anticipation of the U.S. attack is palpable in it's sadness and doom.
What stands out as well, is Eastwood's ability to present a film humanizing all soldiers. even enemies of his/our own country.
The film succeeds as a work of art in uniting it's audience with the story, a tale of a horrible war amidst the soulful need for peace and camaraderie. The following is a poem attributed to the Japanese General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, beautifully played by Ken Watanabe.

  Sadness overcomes me as I am unable to fulfill my duty for my country,
  Bullets and arrows are no more
  I, falling in the field without revenge,
  Will be reborn to take up my sword again.
  When ugly weeds run riot over this island,
  My heart and soul will be with the fate of the Imperial nation.

There is a significant amount of violence in the film, very realistic, appropriate and visceral. In particular there is a scene, without giving it away, that recasts the Japanese tradition of Seppuku in a modern context. The significant cultural traditions and attitudes that are essential to Japan are relevant to understanding this film, and are a worthwhile reason for presenting this film in an educational circumstance.

""Because it is right"":  Honor in Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima

 Japanese culture values honor greatly.  Honor represents the skeleton to the rest of the body, the foundation to the rest of the house.  However, defining honor can pose a difficulty.  Does it involve dying for one's country?  Or does thinking for one's self suffice?  Perhaps the key consists of obeying superior officers?  Honor breaks down into five levels:  honor for self, honor for family, honor for clan, honor for nation, and honor for humanity.  Deciding which takes precedence over the other proves challenging.  Clint Eastwood addresses the questions on honor directly in his film Letters from Iwo Jima.  One can tell immediately what he believes constitutes honor.  Eastwood presents both a common soldier named Saigo and General Kuribayashi as honorable men.  On the other hand, Captain Tashida and most other officers seem dishonorable, though they claim to act for the honor of their country.  In Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood portrays honor to humanity as the most important kind of honor.
 Letters from Iwo Jima shows World War II from the point of view of the Japanese.  Japanese culture promotes honor for one's self, one's family, and one's country.  Because Letters from Iwo Jima focuses on war and defending one's country, the characters would logically concentrate on honor to country rather than honor to family or clan.  However, this view point makes honor to humanity take a back seat.  According to a New York Times article by Ian Buruma, most war films ""lack visible enemies.  [...] What is missing, with rare exceptions, is any sense of individual difference, of character, of humanity in the enemy"" (par. 1).  However, unlike some war movies, Letters from Iwo Jima portrays both the Japanese and the Americans participating in honorable and dishonorable acts.  It shows that race does not matter because all are human.  It shows that certain beliefs are universal.  Honor may vary from place to place, but honor exists everywhere.  It is what is right.  In Letters from Iwo Jima, Clint Eastwood shows the audience that what is right does not differ much between Japan and America.  Honor is about humanity.
 Japanese culture emphasizes obeying and sacrificing for one's family and one's country.  The idea of feeling honored to die for one's country repeats throughout the film.  General Kuribayashi writes to his family saying he is ""determined to serve and die"" for Japan (Letters from Iwo Jima).  However, he disapproves of killing soldiers who retreat.  In fact, he orders the retreat.  Many officers see this as weakness and a disgrace to the emperor; they would rather that the soldiers die honorable deaths by American slaughter or by suicide.  Either of these deaths would align with the ideas of self honor and honor to country.  In one particular scene, Saigo and another soldier have retreated to the northern caves.  The rest of the company had committed suicide instead of following General Kuribayashi's orders.  A lieutenant discovers Saigo and Shizumi and attempts to kill them for retreating, which he sees as dishonorable because he equates this act with cowardice.  General Kuribayashi prevents the lieutenant from killing the two soldiers ""needlessly"" (Letters from Iwo Jima).  Kuribayashi's actions demonstrate honor for humanity rather than for country.  He also strives to prevent suicides, further emphasizing honor to humanity by forbidding a cultural tradition for the sake of lives.  Baruma writes, ""Although he was quite aware of the ultimate fate of his army, he saw no merit in wanton self-destruction"" (par. 19).  He would rather have someone die for their country than for personal honor.
 Letters from Iwo Jima demonstrates some of the dishonorable actions that the Japanese performed.  One scene depicts several Japanese soldiers brutally beating and stabbing an American soldier to death.  The brutality of the American's death goes against the idea of honor to humanity.  In war, people will be killed.  However, these soldiers go beyond protecting themselves and their comrades; they murder.  In another scene, an officer attempts to kill Saigo and another soldier because they retreated.  Both these instances shock viewers and cause them to think about what constitutes right and honor.  These scenes depict the Doctrine of Double Effect, a principle that explains whether or not violence is alright if it occurs ""as a side effect of promoting some good end"" (McIntyre, par. 1).  Eastwood uses these scenes to lead the viewers to believe that, even in wartime, a line exists between defense and murder.  The viewer senses that the Japanese soldiers and the officer do not follow the doctrine, which promotes humanity.
 Unlike most war movies, Letters from Iwo Jima depicts an enemy as moral as the protagonists, capable of good and bad.  ""Most war movies have been about heroes, our heroes, and individual differences among the enemies were irrelevant, since their villainy could be taken for granted"" (Buruma, par. 4).  A scene on par with Buruma's idea of an enemy's villainy occurs when an American soldier shoots two Japanese prisoners because he does not want to guard them for an entire night.  One would think that the director would show only Japanese doing right and only Americans doing wrong because of the film's Japanese perspective.  This is not the case.  Most movies do not show ""recognizable human qualities"" because it would ""inject the murderousness of our heroes with a moral ambiguity that we would not wish to see"" (par. 4); but Letters from Iwo Jima shows Americans with good qualities.  For instance, American marines give water to Japanese prisoners.  Later, an American lieutenant orders his men not to shoot Saigo, though he frantically attacks them with a shovel.  In the last scene of the film, the Americans place Saigo in a line of wounded American soldiers awaiting treatment.  These scenes demonstrate the honor of the enemy in the film in which the enemy respects humanity.
  Both countries hold similar views.  While Americans are often absent in the film, the viewer still sees that both sides have similar views.  Lieutenant Colonel Nishi treats a wounded American soldier to no avail; after the soldier's death, Nishi finds a letter from the soldier's mother.  He reads it aloud to his squad; the expressions of the soldiers tell that they had not thought of the Americans as people before the letter.  One phrase in particular resonates with the soldiers:  ""Always do what's right because it is right,"" (Letters from Iwo Jima).  Nishi uses this in his motivational speech to the soldiers, proving that he believes the same as his enemy's mother.  Later Shizumi tells Saigo that, before meeting the American soldier and hearing the letter, he had thought of the Americans as ""cowards"" and ""savages,"" and he admits to his ignorance concerning the Americans (Letters from Iwo Jima).  He says, ""That American soldier.  His mother's words were the same as my mother's"" (Letters from Iwo Jima).  This phrase strikes the hearts of viewers and Japanese soldiers as something true and honorable.  Through this realization, Eastwood demonstrates that the two countries have similar views and that humanity trumps enmity between people.
 Letters from Iwo Jima exhibits that, no matter which side of the war, everyone can commit honorable and dishonorable acts.  We are human before we belong to a certain race or country.  While the ""right thing"" to do may prove difficult to decide, the importance lies in righteousness (Letters from Iwo Jima).  Clint Eastwood demonstrates honor for humanity by showing both the Japanese and their enemies doing good.  He shows that honor lies in treating enemy wounds and in giving them water.  He defines honor as serving one's country, as well as surviving in order to serve.  Honor is fairness, integrity and, most of all, respecting humanity.  One achieves honor for one's self and one's country by displaying honor for humanity.

The story behind the film is as interesting as the movie itself.  In researching Gen. Kuribayashi for `Flags of Our Fathers', Eastwood was fascinated by his story, pitched the movie, hired a writer and shot the film in a short period of time.

The movie features 2 of the most compelling characters ever presented on film: Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a grunt, and Kuribayashi (Ken Wantanabe), his general.  Wantanabe is magnificent and his performance is equalled. Ninomiya's portrayal of the likable, young soldier is Oscar-worthy.  `LFIJ' is a war film set in the heart of a battle, but these 2 men are bigger than this war.",1268352000,2,871,5.048951048951049

The book describes and/or presents the General in a much more favorable light as both a man and a general.  The film seems to portray him in such a way as to lead one to believe he was inept, cowardly, and self-absorbed.  The movie left much to be desired in it's presentation of the tunnel system the Japanse built and completely ignored the lack of food, fresh water, etc. that was a day to day situation on the island even before the battle started. I felt the movie did a great diservice to the Japanse in terms of being a worthy adversary for the Americans, their dedication to their country, their determination to win a loseing battle when it became clear they would lose and their dedication to their general.

1601628,4,B00005JPKE,"There are by now countless movies on the WWII, many are outstanding on their own merit as they showed the war and its utter destruction to human life, mind, heart, body, society, psyche in every conceivable way. With this very background, it is a whole new experience to watch the 'Letters' movie as it still could find some new way and material to tell a WWII war story. Mr. Eastwood has told a familiar story but from a totally different angle (a completely opposite direction to the American side) to say a different story of a war, whose result is known to all viewers.

Strength of the movie is that it shows more of the human side of the Japanese boys-turned-soldiers for the WWII. To make it authentic - which it is - the film is made in Japanese - though made by an American!! The film is more interested in the hopeless situation the young lads of the Japanese troupes are in and successfully catches their mindset. ""I do not want to die for nothing"" - this comment from a Japanese soldier summarizes it all. It depicts the result of a futile war decided by some incompetent leaders making gross wrong decisions driven by mindless ambition, on the hapless citizens-turned-army of their own country! The boys were defeated - mentally - not just before the battle started, but even before joining the army to fight Japan's 'enemy'. By capturing the pity of the common Japanese in the Imperial Army, the film essentially questions the validity of such a war and subtly endorses the notion of universal brotherhood. The humane treatment of the film seems to pass the feeling that ultimately, the instruments of war are no 'savage' (as the Japanese Army described Americans to their boys) regardless of their nationality, as they are only carrying out the duty as mandated by the rulers.

Problem is to do so, the film needed to show some soft aspects of the Japanese leadership also, which will definitely be felt bit compromising. While it is possible, that there 'were' few good Japanese (the real life Colonel Saito of the 'Bridge On The River Kwai'), but they were only few, and showing them as good or bad as the allied forces is a clear distortion of the truth. This is the only point, which I feel the movie - made with some astonishing cinematography and care - could have handled with more balance.",1261958400,,2312,4.65036674816626

The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art.

Eastwood is to be commended for the innovative tactic of shooting both sides of the war simultaneously and bringing an even-handed weighting to both. The drive of the narrative is not the epic, grand heroics of so much war stuff. These are given ample footage while the lives, up close and personal, of various levels of the Japanese military machine, are tended with gracious detail. This is a very moving account. Mistakenly, I thought I was watching the Eastwood when initially looking at similarily titled, Iwo Jima, 36 days in Hell.

These people foolishly pour accolades upon this film as if it was a historical documentary.  Ridiculous!  The Japanese committed countless horrific atrocities against most of Asia and were without honor and integrity in the way they treated POW's.  They made the Germans seem merciful and tame in comparison.  Just ask any WW II vet.

The Japanese, even to this day are in denial of the truth and re-write their grammar school textbooks, omitting the atrocities and painting themselves as defenders and war heroes instead of the imperialist instigators that they truly were - thanks Clint for helping them to continue perpetuating the lies by making this movie.  Most Japanese even deny that the Rape of Nanking ever occurred - one of the most detestable acts of genocide ever committed.  Raping women, even pregnant women and then bayoneting them and the unborn babies to death.  Whatever horrific act you can imagine, the Japanese committed it and then some.  Just google Unit 731 if you don't believe me.  All of this is in stark contrast to Germans, who very adamantly teach their kids about the Holocaust and why it was wrong in hopes that something like that will never happen again.  The Japanese just want to white wash history and have no interest in perpetuating the truth.

This movie is an inane melodramatic tall tale, but far worse than that, it is a horrible slap in the face of all the American and allied soldiers that defended our freedom and justice.

Clint Eastwood has created a masterpiece here and has managed to portray a side of this conflict that really has never been discussed or shown before. I imagine that the violence was probably worse on both sides, but the point of the movie is that it condemns the concept of war. It shows that conflict does affect both sides and even the worst of enemies can have a family or has some type of humanity. I highly recommend seeing this movie to anyone that's a WWII buff or who wants to just see a great movie.",1231977600,,618,4.336206896551724
1601681,4,B00005JPKE,"The most striking thing to me about Clint Eastwood's companion piece to Flags of our Fathers is how quiet it is.  Despite the fact that this is a war movie with plenty of graphic violence and intense combat sequences, there is nevertheless an erie calm to the proceedings.  Maybe the silence is the calm before the storm....the anticipation and dread that envelops the Japanese soliders as they wait for the inevitable attack by America.

The stillness also adds a meditative quality to the film, which pays homage to the sacrafices made by the Japanese troops.  Unlike Flags of our Fathers which tried to do too many things, Iwo Jima focuses entirely on the days leading up to the battle all the way until its conclusion.  Eastwood masterfully examines the gambit of emotions experienced by the young soldiers;  fear of war, loyalty to their ountry, the desire to die with honor versus the desire to survive and see their families, the pointlessness of battle and their own interpretations of who and what their enemies truly are.

The movie is elegantly filmed and rewards the patience and intelligence of viewers who understand the movie's ultimate theme:  that in the grand scheme of things war is more than just a glorifed game of good vs. evil or cowboys and indians.  It is a bloody and unforgiving conflict engaged in by participants who are equally human on both sides, regardless of what flag they are fighting under.",1230508800,2,1427,4.839506172839506

1601723,5,B00005JPKE,"To most Eastwoods 'Flags of our Fathers' wasn't that great in telling the story of those soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima. I personally loved that film and was delighted to see that Eastwood had done what rarely is, and told the other side to that story from the perspective of the Japanese army. Iwo Jima takes a very similar approach to telling the story of the main soldiers by zooming back and forth from past to present, explaining how the soldiers got to where they where and what they've left at home. I can certainly see the difference between this and 'Flags' and I would certainly rate this as the better, yet would not be willing to shut down 'Flags' in a hurry.

Iwo Jima gives what seems to be an open view on the side of the Japanese and touches upon the Honour principle as to how the soldiers fought without cowardice or retreated with dishonour. This is a strong film when touching upon the Honour principle that the Japanese live by. It even touches upon the fact that some soldiers were actually killed if they displayed any sort of cowardly behaviour and would sooner kill themselves than surrender. It's an emotional experience to watch these Japanese soldiers who don't really want to fight, but are forced into it for fear of being executed as traitors if they refuse.

The island of Iwo Jima is the last part preventing the USA from taking Japanese mainland. Because of this the Japanese are desperate that American soldiers don't take the island, so the Japanese Imperial Army employ General Kuribayashi to develop a strategy that would defeat the American army. However, the general does not approve of the rigid traditional approach by some of his sub-ordinates. He also begins to resent the resistance from the sub-ordinates to follow his new commands and new ideas which he hopes would help defend the Island. In the lower ranks is a young soldier Saigo who, in his home life is a small town baker now forced with the struggle to overcome the inevitability of his death along with his fellow soldiers.

Eastwood has a way of making films that is unmatched by any other film maker today. He's shockingly brilliant and although I'm not crazy over his acting, his directing is truly superb. He manages to blend large scale CGI with blood and guts and the truly emotional story together perfectly to give the viewer one hell of a movie going experience. If you're not a fan of foreign films then this may not be your kind of film due to it being entirely in Japanese. The acting of Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya is just second to none, and will hopefully introduce the greatness that foreign films even if directed by Americans, can be truly superb without the recognition an English speaking film would gain.

I would strongly recommend this film to anyone put off by the fact that it's Japanese speaking. There are subtitles to aid you in following the story, but it's still something to experience even if you have trouble following the subtitles.",1229212800,3,2988,4.685714285714286

1601725,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters from Iwo Jima is an exceptional film. It covers a 40 day period prior to the invasion of US troops on Iwa Jima and the events that occur immediately after. Filmed in sepia tones that are highlighted for fiery explosions, the limited color range made the action more terrible and the drama more heightened.

Two officers lead the Japanese men on Iwo Jima, General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi. The General is played to perfection by Ken Watanabe and the Baron is played with great zeal by Tshuyoshi Ihara. These two men are very worldly and sophisticated, both having lived in the USA. Whereas they are totally loyal to the Emperor and the cult of militarism that dominated Japan during World War II, they also are keenly aware that the Americans are not cowards and fools and that the fight for Iwa Jima will be a living hell. General Kuribayashi takes over command from Admiral Ohsugi, a conservative by-the-book mediocre military man. When General Kuribayashi's assessments are contrary to Admiral Ohsugi's we begin to see professional jealousies arise, ending with the Admiral leaving the island. General Kuribayashi found a situation where he was originally thought he had bombers and ships only to find he really had none. The island had very little fresh water, an insignificant amount in regard to the needs of a military campaign.

The middle ranking officers were certainly interesting in the film. Many of them regarded General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi as American sympathizers and in some cases disobeyed orders.  However these same fellows were also inclined to shot or behead the front line soldiers under their command when they thought that their orders were ignored or undermined or when they suspected retreat. There were repeated examples of how devotion to military authoritarianism combined with draconian rule enforcement is a dangerous combination for small minds.

The front line soldiers were certainly sympathetic and were the heart of the movie. Kazunari Ninomiya played the baker Saigo perfectly.  He is the everyman figure, the lone survivor, the common man that survives despite all the odds against him. The film follows his 40 days as he sees a close friend die of bloody dysentery, as he runs from pillar to post avoiding death as the American's gradually overtake the entire island. He is joined by a young man that he first thinks is a spy for the secret police only to find later that this man has been disgraced for failure to follow an idiotic order from a superior officer.

The Japanese faced amazing odds. Over a 40 day period they suffered over 22,000 casualties until only 216 remained. The empire was crumbling and reinforcements and supplies never came. Hiroshi Wantanabe played the loyal Lieutenant Fujita, aide to the General, who had to repeatedly bear bad news to the General who was plotting how to make the best of an impossible situation.

Clint Eastwood produced a highly entertaining film here. The film is thoughtful and intellectual as it opens our eyes to Japanese culture of the time and the influence on the soldiers and officers. The film also explored empathy as we see several scenes where a top officer, Baron Nishi, converse with a wounded American solder. The Japanese were humanized in the film. They were never made to appear innocent of wartime crimes committed in China and elsewhere. Rather, we were given a balanced vision and insight into the Japanese military culture that fanned the war and the broad range of men and ethics and intelligence levels that interacted in this military-social system. We may not understand fully the authoritarian dictatorial leadership social structure that was the Japanese military norm, but we can see its negative effects on common men with common sense who could not question authority due to rigid social norms.

Overall this is a thoughtful and moving and artistic entertainment experience of a high order.",1226534400,2,3926,5.029230769230769

I normally do not like subtitles, but here the story is so interesting that the titles are just a minor annoyance. This one deserves the honors it brought to Eastwood, and to the major actors in it. The emotional wallop here is what eluded Eastwood when he recreated the American side of the month-long fight on that island in 1945. If you care about World War II, this is a ""must see."" If you hate the Japanese for the cruelty of their troops, and for their stubborn refusal to surrender even when battle outcomes were obvious, this film explains their reasoning. It will not convert you to their side, of course, but it does humanize their patriots.

With restraint and sensitivity, Eastwood has shown us how really futile war is and the sacrifices of the ordinary foot soldier, whether they be Japanese or American.  In some quarters, many critics felt Clint should've taken Best Picture and Best Director but the Academy did finally give an long over-due Oscar to Martin Scorsese for ""The Departed"".  But who's to say which is the better--like apples and oranges, these 2 films achieved their goals brilliantly. But getting back to ""Letters"", special mention should be given to the performances here given by Ken Watanabe as the commander and Kazunari Ninomiya as cook turned soldier. Their performances lend a special poignancy to this film as well as the other performers in this film.  The battle scenes are just as powerful as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"" though one should remember that Spielberg was one of the producer of this film as well.  In HD DVD, these scenes are brilliantly delinerated.  Highly recommeded.",1217116800,2,1127,5.037634408602151
1601730,4,B00005JPKE,"It was a brave move by Eastwood to make not one but two movies about Iwo Jima, and braver still to show the pivotal conflict from each sides point of view.  Where Flags of Our Fathers was flawed in its approach, muting the impact, `Letters..' is more perfectly formed, and arguably more complex in nature - and it's a success.
Through sepia, almost colourless photography, we see the defence of Iwo Jima from the viewpoint of several Japanese soldiers.  We see them, and we hear them in the forms of their letters they write home, letters that they know may never reach their intended recipients. From this simple framework, we see the build up of defences as the new commanding officer arrives (Ken Watanabe, brilliant) and also from the viewpoint of the soldiers filling sandbags, through to the invasion of the hordes of Americans, and through to the final death throes of the last vestiges of defence.
The range of characters (working class disillusioned solider, aristocratic gentleman officer, honourable commanding officer sworn to his duty but grieved with it) is wider than we might expect, and makes the anti-war message very clear - we are all the same.  Previous war movies have shown one man from the other side to be more complex or sympathetic to us, but here we see the whole Japanese cross section of society, and it presents us with a picture on one hand of a society different from ours, and yet so similar in the humanity of it.  Even in one sub-section - the officers for example, a complex range of views, opinions and impact is observed. One of the key moments comes in the capture of an American soldier, and how even if some of the soldiers can not separate the propaganda from what they see, the words of his mother in a letter are so universal maternal, that they can not help but see what is common between them is greater than that which is different.
It feels like quite a long movie, and the pace is stately in an almost Japanese style which may put some off, however this pushes the movie beyond some flash bang war movie to satisfy the bloodthirsty, and creates that difficult thing - a movie about the war, showing the war, yet a firm indictment of the effects of war.",1215734400,3,2202,4.595419847328245
1601731,5,B00005JPKE,"This is clearyly Clint Eastwood's greatest work.

We all get to see Iwo Jima. We all  know the image of the guys hoistng old Glory atop the Japanese Hill. We Americans have seen it in many films like the one with John Wayne but this time we get to see it through eyes of the other side that of the Japanese. From the ordinary grunt to the Japanese Navy officer who goes so gung ho that he tries to find himself an american tank to throw himself under but ultimately gets captured (This is based on a real person who was there in the battle and captured, read about him once in The Rising Sun by John Toland, wish they had shown more with him). To the General in charge. From the first arrival to the final charge, it shows the Japanese soldiers well. And Clint Eastwood serves us well telling us about them through their eyes with this film of his. Just as I respect him for showing what American soldiers were like as well. Since Japanese troops did not take prisoners and mistreatedt hose they took many American units did not take prisoners either.

Admittedly, the battle was well fought and due to lack of opprtunity, no major crimes typical of Japanese soldiers such as the rape of Nanking or the butchery of Manilla or the Bataan Death March or the murder and eating of captured American Airmen at near by Chichi Jima, so it is very easy to admire the Japenese here.

Unlike Flags I felt that this film gave a greater examination of the individual soldier and the personal daemons he has to face both in preparation for battle and during it.  The film gives us flash backs to some of the men's lives back in Japan, the families they left behind and the emotional turmoil they were suffering with both willing to serve the Emperor in the war effort and return to their loved ones.

The film also examines some of the reasons as to why the Japanese lost the war.  Far from being highly disciplined men commanding officers are shown to disobey direct orders to retreat and regroup from seniors and lead their men into hopeless counter attacks.  The lack of ammunition that the Japanese army had and also their lack of troops and supplies.

The film displays touching scenes of both camaraderie between soldiers (For example a soldier sent to their unit who initially they thought was sent to spy on them turns out to have been sent there because he refused to shoot a families dog) and also the camaraderie between opposing armies (The treatment of an injured American soldier by his Japanese captors)

1601767,4,B00005JPKE,"This film is worth seeing for its perspective. Normally, we are treated to nationalist, war-glorifying depictions of the Battle for Iwo Jima (and WWII in general), but LETTERS... explores the events from the Japanese perspective. Instead of caricaturing Japanese soldiers as uniformly blind in their obedience to the Emperor and military command, the characters in this film are individuals. Even those who seem to fit the kamikaze stereotype defy orders when the orders are not ""patriotic"" enough. But the protagonist of the story is one who, like many Americans, was forced into service against his will -- forced to abandon his wife and budding family to kill and die for the imperialist ambitions of his country. He wants nothing more than to survive this hell.

LETTERS... is not a pro-war film. It depicts the horror and senselessness of war. However, there are some culturally imperialistic elements to the story. The sensible Japanese officers were schooled or spent time in America. The other officers (and many soldiers) think they are weak and, instead, want to engage in pointless kamikaze missions that will only weaken the Japanese cause. Maybe this is accurate. But if not, the implication is that the Japanese -- one of the most fearsome military forces in the history of the world -- did not know how to wage war.

1601768,2,B00005JPKE,"What a disappointment. Gosh, I had heard so much about this movie and had somehow drawn the conclusion that life itself would be enhanced after viewing it. However, the film did little for me at all. I thought it a great bore, highly sentimental, strangely unrealistic, anti-Japanese and anti-American. In the first place, the film emphasizes the Japanese concept of honor but then shows the officers acting with shameless dishonor. The General, who is depicted as a solid guy, can't find anyone willing to obey his orders. The officers are so eager to commit suicide, it is a wonder they waited for the American to attack. Virtually every command made by an officer to an enlisted man is greeted with, ""yeah, but..."" instead of ""yes, sir."" It is chaos down in those tunnels. One group is going one way, while another is going another. The General's orders never get delivered, and anyone who wants to fight is killed for disobeying the order to commit suicide. I don't believe anything like this took place. The one American captured is fed and treated with precious medicines, but the one Japanese captured by the Americans is shot on the spot, white flag in hand. The fat, smoking soldier who shoots him point blank can't be bothered to guard him. The Japanese come off as the keystone cops, while the Americans, presumably led by Darth Vader, are well-fed, heartless slobs. More Japanese are killed by each other than by the enemy. When they are not swinging their swords at each other, they are aiming their pistols. There are three guys in particular whose job it is to kill as many of their fellow soldiers as possible, for fear they might say something against the Emperor, or fail to kill themselves at the first sight of the enemy. These loud-mouths are extremely obnoxious. I am not sure what Clint Eastwood wanted to achieve by making this ""culturally sensitive"" nonsense, but I am now persuaded that his aims have nothing to do with art and everything to do with propaganda. Was this supposed to make me see that the Japanese are human too? ""Can't we just get along?"" Well, I for one am all in favor of getting along, but it is hard to stand by in silence while watching one country destroy another. I'd advise Mr. Eastwood to read the history of the Japanese in Asia, beginning with Korea.",1209168000,8,2303,4.702970297029703
1601769,5,B00005JPKE,"As the title implies, many words can be used to describe this movie, including slow (not in a bad way at all), deliberate (in a very good way), contemplative, and more.  Fantastic and fascinating also.

Letters from Iwo Jima gives those that watch the film the view from the other side of the battle at Iwo Jima, the side that most U.S. citizens (and other persons not of Asian descent) would likely not be aware of.  Clint Eastwood did this film as a companion piece to his much lauded film Flags of Our Fathers.  Flags is a look at the heroes of Iwo Jima.  I won't go into details about that film other than to say once you've seen it you realize that looking at Flags as a film about heroes is not what you wind up left with at the end.  Watch that film and you'll know what I'm referring to.

Flags was a telling of the U.S. and Allied side of the events that happened on Iwo Jima, but also much more, including a good long look at the lives of the people that were fighters at Iwo Jima once those people had returned to the U.S. mainland.  While Flags doesn't demonize the Japanese military that was fighting the U.S. and allied forces at Iwo, it doesn't give any real details into the experiences of the other side.

Letters gives us a long look into the Japanese military personnnel that served at Iwo Jima.  We get to see how they prepared for the inevitable battle, and how the people on the island faced a destiny they weren't necessarily happy to have to meet.  While many U.S. citizens may think of the Japanese soldiers in terms of willing to fight to the death and gladly lay down their lives in honor of their emperor, the soldiers that served at Iwo were not necessarily people that wanted to do that.  They had family to think of, had home lives they longed to return to, and had been left with little resources and logistical support as they became the last line of defense against U.S. Naval power on the way to the Japanese homeland.

As another reviewer notes in their comments, the vast majority of the dialogue for the soundtrack for this film is in Japanese.  Viewers will most likely be watching this film with subtitles on constantly, with those subtitles in U.S. English translating the dialogue and providing the story for those viewers to understand (without having to learn Japanese first ;-) )  Unlike the reviewer that complained about the pacing of the subtitles, I had no issue with how long they were shown on the screen as the conversations flowed.  There was plenty of time to read the subtitle and also take in the images that were shown, and the subtitles weren't distracting for me at all.

Though this film is a companion to Flags of Our Fathers, personally I believe this is the better film, and I would note that you really don't need to see either film in order to enjoy or appreciate the other.  Further, I would have to say that perhaps using the word 'enjoy' here is not quite appropriate.  Letters isn't a film that will bring joy for most viewers.  It's not a depressing film, but it's also not an uplifting film.  It documents, in a documentarian style, the events that happened at Iwo Jima, mostly from the Japanese side, and does so without glorifying or villifying war and it's participants.

Letters is, in my opinion, a master work and is well worth owning for me.  While it may not be a film that viewers would want to see more than once or twice, it most certainly should be viewed at least once, and somewhat savored for the fine film that it is.

One last comment here, relating to the film style used.  If you watch the film on HD DVD (or perhaps Blu-ray) you may feel somewhat offput by the grainy feel of the image used in many places on the film.  That look is intentional and really seems appropriate (to me) for this film.  That look may bother some, but I think it works well as it's used here.",1207699200,4,3860,4.4229137199434225

1601772,4,B00005JPKE,"Clearly Eastwood attempted to make an anti-war film equivalent to ""All Quiet ON The Western Front"" but he failed.  The film was intended to humanize the Japanese and was very politically correct since it showed the Japanese in a very positive light while showing the Americans as brutal.  The scene where the American soldiers shot the prisoners was totally out of context and clearly placed there to reinforce the usual Hollywood view of the American Military.  The film failed to show or even indicate any of the brutality or inhumanity shown by the Japanese to their prisoners or even civilians.  This was a sad film but very one-sided and even distorted since it failed to show the actual conduct of the Japanese outside of the futility of the Bushido code.  The Japanese soldiers were shown as reluctant soldiers who were actually being victimized by their leaders and the Bushido code, while the few views of the Americans showed them as murderers.

I usually avoid all Hollywood films dealing with the military because they are always anti-military and anti-American military in particular and this film was no different.  It was well done from a techical viewpoint and for that reason I gave it four stars but if you have ever been in the American Military this is just another backhanded slap at soldiers.  It is an anti-war film but it never shows any context for the war or the consequences of not fighting.

Actually this could be seen as an anti-anti-war film because it can be viewed as a lesson in siege warfare.  It is an excellent examination of the practical problems facing the commander of a fortress when put under siege.  It demonstrates that the commander can only last as long as his supplies and must be relieved from outside.  A failure to gain relief can only result in an erosion of morale and loss of effectiveness.  From the that perspective this was a good training film.

But in the end this was just another Hollywood film that once agains shows that Hollywood believes war is an American invention and that all that is needed is talk and a few choruses of Kumbaya.",1206748800,,2098,4.743801652892562

I highly recommend this film, even though the subject matter is painful to watch, it deals with the letters written home, and the experiences of
Japanese soldiers trapped on Iwo Jima, from the personal viewpoints of them.  You see the madness of a fanatic Leiutenant, the humanity of regular guys, trapped in something way over their heads.  You see how fanaticism warped ancient tradition, turning what was once a matter of honor into an insane disregard for basic humanity.

When you see an Olympic equine jumper try to maintain a shred of normal
life-it crashes in around him after a strafing run kills his beloved horse.

Not all of the men trapped inside the caves bought into the official line
of madness, one poor soul grabs family photos while sobbing, only to pull
the grenade pin-because everyone else has bought into this warped idea
of honor.

It's no honor, especially when one thinks of the utterly futile waste of
good men, men who could have contributed so very much to the rebuilding
and economic boom of the post-war era.  Maybe because I think from a fem-
inine horror of waste-but these men would have been wonderful assets to
their families and nation after the war-if they hadn't been trapped into
an utterly futile and stupid death.

What a waste-and shame on the people who blithely proclaimed such bull,
without realizing the stupid, stupid futile madness of it all.

Eastwood endeavors to demonstrate that there were Japanese who hated the privations inflicted by being on that island just as much as the Americans who conquered it. Japanese who would rather be at home or on their horses. But it was their tragic sense of duty that ensured that of the original strength of 25,000 that only a few hundred survived.

This movie is told from the Japanese point of view.

If the movie is true, unfortunately the Japanese general was competent, when he first arrived, he got off his plane and walked the terrain, he did not just go into the operations center and look at maps.

He then completely scrapped the defensive plan.  Moved the revetments so that the machine guns had enfilading fire. Moved the artillery back to the military crest on the mountain. Then dug in his troops into the mountains, rendering the U.S. Naval bombardment effectively impotent.

If we'd had today's liberal media back then, we would have quit after the first one thousand soldiers and marines were killed.

I for one am glad we didn't have instant communication in 1944.

The problem is not the artistic work itself, it is the false portrayal of typical Japanese soldiers of WWII. This movie was shot through western eyes and using western values. Making the Japanese soldiers then appear to be noble people. Well nothing could be further from the truth. In the rape of Nanking in 1936, the Japanese soldiers were savage and brutal. Rape and murder of thousands of Chinese. Japanese soldiers for sport, threw babies in the air and impaled them with their bayonets. In Guam, an American territory was occupied by the Japanese. They beheaded a Catholic priest and many others because the loyal Guamaninans refused to tell the Japanese where a US navy sailor was hiding. The Battann death march, where POW soldiers died. Those who fell and were too weak were bayonetted on the spot and died where they lay. Need I go on? You get the idea.

1601837,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters From Iwo Jima, and its companion film, Flags of Our Fathers are two of the best World War II movies I have ever seen.  These two films need to be seen back to back.  They both clearly show how nasty war is, bringing the human faces of war to you in a manner too hard to ignore. And what makes them stand out from the rest, is that not only is the war seen from the very real human side of the tale, but even more importantly, from both sides of the conflict.  Watch Flags of Our Fathers first and Letters from Iwo Jima second.  Clint Eastwood directs both.  Flags of Our Fathers was developed from the nonfiction best seller that James Bradley wrote about his father, John ""Doc"" Bradley, the last survivor among the six soldiers who raised the flag on Iwo Jima.  The politics and real story behind this very famous photo and statue are fascinating, and disturbing.  Letters from Iwo Jima tells the story of the attack on Iwo Jima as told by letters buried on Iwo Jima during the attack.  It give the Japanese soldiers a human face that generally is not seen in the typical war movies that just shows them as the enemy.  In this movie you will see the Japanese soldiers as they really were, young men with families, and loves just like our own soldiers.

1601838,5,B00005JPKE,"I was very pleased with this movie. After wading through ""Flags"", it took me a couple months to regain enough interest in another Eastwood movie on the same subject. I am sorry that I waited so long.

As someone who has read a great deal about WWII, I am amazed at some of the reviews. Yes, Marines did shoot prisoners, wounded Japanese (21,000 soldiers do not die instantly on the battle field) and even corpses they happened upon. This was not the norm, but this battle and that of Okinawa, were in a class of their own given their ferocity, scale, suicidal fanaticism and kill or be killed nature.

It would have been nice had they been able to film the movie on site, but given the nature of Iwo today (one large cemetery), it is understandable why they could not.

This is a $19MM film that told a story of a handful of soldiers with the battle of Iwo Jima as a back drop. It was not meant to portray the fullness of the actual battle and the tens of thousands of people who suffered over 35 days of savage combat. It is not ""anti-American"" nor does it portray the Japanese as saints. It is refreshing to see a movie made from the perspective of the other side. For some reason, we see our history and battles as black and white; all good vs evil. While World War II was certainly in most all aspects a ""black and white"" conflict (few sane people would ever try to defend Nazi ideology or Japanese militarism), it is interesting that most all of the people we were fighting in fierce combat were our sworn allies in a matter of months after the war. What drove such behavior and why? What did we/they learn? How do we avoid the rise of such ruinous systems in the future (sadly, these questions are not being asked often enough in Japan as they have been in Germany)?

What's objectionable is the portrayal of U.S. soldiers casually shooting prisoners of war.  Did such a thing happen in the War in the Pacific?  I'm sure it did, but there's no record of it happening during the battle of Iwo Jima, and it's a distortion to include that scene, which is hypothetical in this case and is given a prominent place in the movie's plot.*  In a small way it's like De Palma's ""Redacted"": based on some truth but leaving out so much context that it becomes a de facto lie.

1601842,4,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood's ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is an interesting departure from the traditional American war narrative that presents the Japanese army as merely a bunch of ruthless, fanatical, implacable killers who made life a living hell for the American troops that fought them in the Pacific theatre.  Here, we see gradations and nuances among the Japanese soldiers that are not typically part of the story -- draftees, sad sacks and proto-pacifists, pitted against martinets, fanatics and sadistic officers, as well as officers and high commanders who had different philosophies and different kinds of military training from one another, and who did not always agree on how best to fight the war.

Although it is not by any means a perfect film, it is powerful.  It's certainly much better than the companion piece, Eastwood's ""American"" Iwo Jima film, ""Flags Of Our Fathers,"" which I found muddled and often trite. ""Letters"" is clearly the film that was most important to Eastwood to get right -- he pours more feeling into it, and gave it a much stronger and more cohesive narrative.  I agree that it's not the greatest war film ever made, but it does open up a new dialogue on some important historical issues, and presents, however obliquely, a tragic picture of the death of Japan's vestigial bushido honor code on the pyre of modern mass warfare.

I think this film does an adequate job of presenting Japanese wartime society as a spectrum of opinions and temperaments -- it's simplistic, yes, but that is the nature of a feature film script, and to the degree that Eastwood does *not* present the Japanese as a monolithic culture, I think the film is a success.  The portrayal of Iwo Jima as a doomed, desperate last stand -- an Asian Alamo, if you will -- is interesting as well, although Eastwood may oversell this point, and gives little indication (in this film) of how tough formidable the Japanese soldiers were, or the degree to which they had an efficient, modern military.  By the time of this battle, their fleet had been crushed and their supply lines and command and control were breaking down so looking just at this moment in time is a little misleading, although not entirely inaccurate.  I'm not a big WWII buff, but I think its obvious that Eastwood has walked a fine line between different factions who choose to view history in various ways.  And, yes, it's a Hollywood film, so it resorts to melodrama and simplification... Yet it still presents a viewpoint that has rarely been seen, particularly by American audiences.  It's worth adding to our historical repertoire, and gives us some new shadings of understanding about the war, putting a more human face on was has been traditionally portrayed as a near-inhuman foe.  It's worth checking out, and seems to have been a labor of love on Eastwood's part.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1198627200,2,2869,4.8806584362139915

While each film can stand (very elegantly and sturdily) on its own, they are complementary. I first saw ""Flags of Our Fathers"",  then ""Letters..."", and I believe that is the order in which they were filmed.

Both movies are honest in a way many war movies are not.  They show the war, the effects of the war on young men and their families, and in so doing, they further explore the mystery of why we humans have such a long and bloody history of killing each other.  Although there is blood and guts galore, I was left with the feeling that I was being shown the truth. Neither movie is simply a manipulative attempt to horrify, frighten or convince the viewer. ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" represent, I fervently hope, an evolution in the film industry's ( and hence the American public's) perception of war and our ""enemies"".

1601894,3,B00005JPKE,"I heard many great reviews on the movie and even though I thought that Flags of Our Fathers was a bit slow, I hoped this would be different.  I found many glaring flaws with the movie that I found very distracting.  As someone else mentioned, there were 22,000 Japanese on that island and only 236 remained alive after the battle.  This number is absolutely staggering if you know anything about war.  Take the battle at Gettysburg for instance.  There were approximately 4,000 deaths and 40,000 casualties out of forces nearing 150,000 on both sides.  This is typical of a ""regular"" battle.  The number of deaths is actually extremely low compared to the total and only a fraction of those injured or otherwise incapacitated thus counting as a casualty.  So for the Japanese to have such loses is truly something amazing.

They died in those numbers because they ""fought"" to the death.  The impression you got from this movie was that 90% of them commited suicide.  Or that for much of the battle, people stood around in caves with little to do except talk about their dire situation.  There is a story of one soldier who said that they were drinking their own urine after so many days without water and after a while they were urinating blood.  There was no real sense for the lack of supplies in this movie.

I find it amazing that it has taken this long for America to make a movie from a perspective other than its own.  The British and Germans make movies that take into account the other person's perspectives. I remember reading one of Stephen Ambrose's books where he recalled a rather telling story.  He visited a British soldier to discuss the battle of Pegasus Bridge.  The officer told him that he should interview a good friend of his - who turned out to be a German officer that was present on the opposing side of that battle.  Ambrose thought that he had nothing to gain, nor would he interview a member of the ""enemy"" force.  Are you kidding me?  And he calls himself a historian?  Yet that is what I also tend to see with American movie makers and watchers.  To see a movie from the ""other side"" is to somehow be a traitor.  That is ridiculous.  There IS another side and it only helps to to understand the REALITY of the situation to see it, not just to see it from your own very limited view point.

Thus on those grounds I think this movie is very important.",1196899200,7,2380,4.5046728971962615
1601895,5,B00005JPKE,"""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is the second and less publicized half (along with ""Flags of our Fathers"") of Clint Eastwood's pair of movies about the battle for Iwo Jima near the end of World War II. Based on some actual letters from the Japanese commander on the island to his family in Tokyo, the film tells the story of the American invasion from the perspective of the Japanese troops dug in to protect part of their homeland (politically, Iwo Jima, though an almost uninhabitable rock located hundreds of miles from the mother islands, was part of the Tokyo district of Japan). The Japanese soldiers were put in the unenviable predicament of serving as a stalling tactic. Japanese high command never supported them with the intent of defeating the American invaders, just slowing them down and causing a lot of casualties, hopefully enough to cause the Americans to sue for peace. On the other side, the Americans needed the island badly as a refueling point for bombers tasked to attack the Japanese mainland.

With a cast of actors largely unknown to American audiences (though star Ken Watanabe was in ""Memoirs of a Geisha""), Eastwood can focus your attention on the relationship between the commander and his men and of both to their hopeless mission. To me, Eastwood's (and the commander's) message is loud and clear to political leaders--be very careful about starting a war because wars are so difficult, painful and costly to end. Soldiers who are sent into battle to do nothing but kill and die have families and loved ones at home. Every casualty is a personal tragedy that ultimately may be not be justified by the war's outcome. Kudos to Eastwood for making the film. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is not light entertainment. Five stars for fans of serious and thought-provoking cinema.",1196121600,2,1791,4.891447368421052

I wrote Amazon and they responded that it was too late to return it but not whether this was something wrong with my disk or with all of them. I would like to have the movie and would be willing to pay the few bucks to buy another disk but not until I know something about this problem.

You really get to see the story of many of the Japanese who fought and died defending those islands, and ther perspective was very interesting and unique. I rated this movie 3 stars for a few simple reasons: most of the dialogue it's in japanese, this makes it hard to follow and get involved.

1601900,5,B00005JPKE,"As much as I liked Flags of Our Fathers, I was not prepared for the emotional reaction I would have to this brilliant film. Eastwood is one of the greatest living directors (and will rank with the best of all time).  He is consistently growing in scope and compassion; he's long past his Dirty Harry vigilante movies.  I think only an Eastwood could have pulled off this movie showing the Japanese side of the battle of Iwo Jima.  At the end I was crying, for these soldiers who knew they were dying and doomed, as well as for our soldiers who fought bitterly for that island.  Most of all I cried for the horrendous waste of life in wars started by greedy and unscrupulous politicians, right up to today's Bushes and Cheneys who glorify war (but never fought themselves).

I couldn't forget (nor was I meant to forget) the horrors inflicted by the Japanese on the Allies or the Rape of Nanking.  But this one focuses on the soldiers who are taught dying is great for their country, many of whom would just prefer to be home with their families and don't think the war is great.

The acting is first rate; so were the direction, the script, photography.  In short, this film is damned near perfect.  I cried for all the soldiers forced to die for something many did not believe in.  As Dylan once wrote, every country thinks God is on its side.",1192924800,4,1344,4.448979591836735
1601901,5,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood's companion piece to ""Flags of Our Fathers"" may be the director's finest work to date. In telling the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, Eastwood is sympathetic to the soldiers whose attempt to defend the island is doomed, but with the exception of one scene, does so without vilifying the American troops who succeeded where the Japanese failed.

The film succeeds by personalizing the war for the men who fought it. Whatever one thinks of their cause, these men are motivated by the same patriotic forces as the Americans, and are simply doing what they believe is just. After all, wars are planned and manipulated by men who never set foot on the battlefield. Even the most heroic soldiers, regardless of the country from which they hail, fight in service to interests that benefit the business community more than their country.

Eastwood's one false and manipulative move is a scene in which two Japanese deserters are cold-bloodly gunned down by Americans. This is in stark contrast to an earlier moment when an American held hostage by the opposition is treated respectfully by his captors. The latter scene is an admirable attempt to humanize the enemy but is unnecessary since the film has already successfully countered the smirking and monstrous stereotypes of the Japanese that were promoted by Hollywood during and shortly after World War II. The barbarism we witness from the Americans, however, whether accurate or not, seems like sop meant to appeal to the anti-American sentiments expressed as a result of our invasion of Iraq.

Technically, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is faultless. Tom Stern's cinematography is appropriately murky, and the imagery striking. The performances are all superb, especially from Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi, Kazunari Nonomiya as Saigo, and Tsuyoshi Ihara as Baron Nishi. The screenplay by Iris Yamahita and Paul Haggis is compact, and nicely interweaves scenes of the men's earlier civilian life with their dreary existence awaiting certain death. The music score by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is haunting and subtle

The extras are a little skimpy but include some interesting behind-the-scenes information, some footage from the premiere at Budokan, and a press conference featuring Eastwood and his exceptional cast. The latter provides an opportunity to learn more about players who, with the exception of Watanabe, are unknown in the U.S.

Not all peoples act the same, although this movie tried to show ambivalence on the part of some American soldiers.  American cruelty in WWII was not comparable to that of any other soldiers and any attempt to show the contrary is just wrong.  Our fighters were no angels, but they did not display anything like the inhumanity shown by one patrolman on the streets of his home town, nor would our soldiers demand wholesale suicide when things take a turn south.

1601954,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters from Iwo Jima is an extraordinary film.  Despite its depiction of war, it is a much quieter, serene, and moving film than its sister film,  Flags of Our Fathers.  It does touch on how soldiers are pawns in politicans' schemes like Flags, but this film concentrates almost exclusively on the Japanese soldiers themselves, most of whom died defending the island.  Ken Watanabe gives a towering performance as the commander of the island, a vastly intelligent, articulate, caring man, who nevertheless does what he feels is his duty to his country, knowing very well that he will most likely be killed.  Like Flags, we really get to know these soldiers like we were in the platoon ourselves, and aside from a few war speeches, Letters and Flags never feel like they are propaganda, gun-ho garbage that Hollywood and others have been known for putting out.  Clint's direction is breathtakingly assured.  When you take into account that Clint speaks no Japanese, and he directs a film almost exclusively in Japanese, it makes the film even more extraordinary to behold.  There has only been a few films in history that have managed to do this, a film where a foreign director immerses himself so much in the culture that if you didn't know it was a foreign director directing the film, you'd swear it was a native of the country (Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, and Tarkovsky's The Sacrifice are examples of this phenomenon).

Perhaps the best example of Clint's direction is in the following scene. One of the Japanese soldiers arrives at the island, and the other soldiers believe him to be a spy sent by the officers.  He eventually tells them his story, and why he was sent to Iwo Jima.  He was enforcing curfew in a local town with one of his officers, and they pass by one of the houses where a dog is barking rather loudly.  The officer informs the soldier to take the dog inside the house, and shoot it.  The soldier takes the dog into the house, and the family is horrified.  The soldier shoots a bullet in the air, and tells the family to keep the dog quiet. The soldier then leaves the house, but the dog barks again. The officer becomes furious, and he goes into the house to shoot the dog. But you never see the dog being shot, you only hear the shot, and see the soldier's reaction (only the officer goes into the house).  This makes the scene so powerful and sad. The soldier was sent to Iwo Jima because he let the dog live, and the officer was furious that the soldier disobeyed him.  The way Clint films this scene is why it's so memorable.  A lesser director would have shown the dog getting shot, with hand held shots and hysterical screaming. He would have tried to justify his decision by saying ""it's more realistic"", which it is, but there is no art, poetry, or intelligence in that. It's lame shock value, which will always lessen the dramatic impact of a scene.

The lessons of war are so vivid here and in Flags.  Almost none of the Japanese soldiers made it back from Iwo Jima, and the American ones who did got exploited by the media and the government.  When they were done with them, they were forgotten about.  Both films are very sad, but they are necessary viewing.  There are moments of pure poetry in both films.  Letters has more though.  There is a deep sadness to this film especially, and it's darkened cinematography really enhances it.

Recently, letters from those defenders of Iwo Jima in World War II were unearthed in a cave, unmailed. Then the movie flashes back to the war. The letters home furnish much of the story. Ordinary Japanese conscripts are  stationed on this god-forsaken island. This is a sympathetic movie about them. They know the Americans are coming. They have to. They don't know when. They hope reenforcements are coming. But they also know they are going go die. Hopefully they will do so with honor. In so many ways they are just guys like our men with their petty gripes about the food, the waiting around, their fool superior officers etc. American soldiers want to live but many will die. Japanese choose death over defeat & that is the big difference. I felt for their plight as many did kill themselves during the battle. However, there was a glimmer of hope. Several of their officers had been to America before the war. Their exposure to our culture convinced them there might be another way.

The Japanese actors are excellent and the dialogue was snappy and original, though I had to re-wind a couple times because my eyes couldn't keep up with the subtitles.  I tend to go 'cross-eyed' if it's fast.  I especially love the baker character who didn't really want to be there and left a young, pregnant wife at home.  The movie was excellent in showing how many get caught up in a war they don't necessarily believe in.

Even the subtitles didn't distract from the enjoyment of the story. Some commentators with a political agenda have pointed out a scene in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA where Americans committed a war crime, as if director Eastwood was making a blanket statement against American troops. But not long before that scene, he shows the Japanese committing a war crime. If the use of flame throwers seems a bit extreme in an all-out war against a no-surrender enemy, think about the Bataan Death March. The movie also shows some Japanese officers as being cruel toward their own men, ready to execute them on the spot without a trial for minor offenses. This attitude toward human life is reflective of the general kind of Japanese leadership that led to massive atrocities in China and elsewhere during World War Two. To see the battle for Iwo Jimo from the persepective of the Japanese who fought there is probably quite a novel movie-going experience for most Americans. You see the American air force, fleet and soldiers as the detached, distant, near silent enemy from the point of view of the Japanese soldiers (roles very well-acted) and the Americans are quite ominous -- and deadly. If anything, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is a kind of reverse fan letter to the American boys who fought and died in the Pacific against a brutal and homicidally aggressive dictatorship that attempted to enslave millions of people.",1185753600,4,1578,4.913857677902621

The reality is that it is war - on both sides there was cruelty/hate, but what this movie does a good job of is show the common element of humanity.  We have seen the US WWII movies depicting our soldiers humanity, but this helps to demonstrate the other side, which I think was part of the purpose of the movie.

On that note, I found myself wondering what my grandfather would have thought of the movie (he has passed, but he was a WWII veteran who fought against the Japanese on Okinawa with the Marines).  I concluded that he would not have liked the movie, judging that it portrayed the Japanese in too good of a light, and the Americans in a negative one.

1602112,5,B00005JPKE,"This is the second movie Clint Eastwood did about the ""Battle of Iwo Jima"".  The first was ""Flags of Our Fathers"" that told the story of the TWO flat raisings atop Suribachi, the famous photograph, and the bond drive the funded the latter stages of the war, but at a great cost to the men pulled into that PR engine.  They became casualties of the war as much as those killed or wounded in the battle itself.

Here, we see the battle from the perspective of the Japanese who were sent to defend that island and thereby delay the invasion of the Japanese Homeland.  They know the battle will be cataclysmic, but believe there will be reinforcements, naval support, and that they will be supplied with more planes.  When they learn none of this is true, they also realize they are being asked to fight until death.

The conditions on the island are not very good.  The water is bad and is giving most of them dysentery.  The new general, Kuribayashi, rescinds the beach defense and wants them to tunnel out the mountain Suribachi.  He wants to prolong the battle as long as possible.  The hard line traditional officers don't like his approach and don't trust him because he has spent time in America and gotten to know American officers.  His one true supporter on the island is Baron Nishi, who won a gold medal in horse jumping at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932.

When the assault does come, the Japanese are stunned by the utter size of the invasion force.  Some fight, some commit suicide (against orders) so they can die with ""honor"", but almost all die.  In real life, of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on the island, all but 216 died.  Among the American invasion force of 110,000, 8,226 died and 19,189 were wounded and almost 500 went missing.

The movie uses a fictional character named Saigo, a baker conscripted into the war, to link the various elements of the battle together by his movements.  A very nice device.  It is this character who buries the letters of the title that are uncovered by modern day archaeologists digging in the caves and tunnels of Suribachi.

Some have criticized the movie for making the ""Americanized"" Japanese officers the stars.  I have no opinion about that argument, but I really enjoyed the movie.  The fact that it is almost entirely in Japanese with subtitles didn't bother me in the least.

1602113,3,B00005JPKE,"""Letters from Iwo Jima"" tells the story of the American attack on the tiny island of Iwo Jima during WWII from the perspective of its Japanese defenders.

This film, although although OK on its own terms, suffers in comparison to the ""other"" Iwo Jima movie that director Clint Eastwood filmed at the same time - the excellent ""Flags of our Fathers"", which tells the story from the American perspective.

Eastwood is less comfortable telling this story and it ends up being an uncomfortable mixture of Japanese stoicism and American sentiment, which as not as moving as it would like to be.

Given the dearth of WWII films from the Japanese perspective, this film tries to make up for it by packing in so many characters and subplots it eventually becomes wearisome.

The performances are all excellent especially Ken Watanabe as the Japanese commander - General Tadamichi Kuribayashi - but Eastwood misses the bullseye with this one.",1184889600,4,933,4.961538461538462

Japan's 22,000 soldiers fought bravely for forty days against an American invasion of 70,000 troops; only 2,000 Japanese survived the carnage. The film does a remarkable job of helping us to view our ostensible ""enemies"" as fellow human beings; in almost every respect the combatants are mirror images of each other. They complain about army food, make crude jokes about women, see through the lies that their own government feeds them, fight bravely despite being horribly under-resourced, cuss at broken equipment, make the best of a dehumanizing task, and receive and write letters to their loved ones back home.

People are strange.

Letters from Iwo Jima, and this is the first time I say this Cliche in 9 years of reviewing: is unflinching. There are times when you wish the camera would leave a little more to the imagination, sure, but war is brutal. This film is brutal. But, it is nice to see a film that has not become ""pearlharborized"" and suggestive.

The center of the plot in one sentence: The Japanese side of Iwo Jima. I'll tell you what though, there is a lot to it. I left both this film and Flags with a greater appreciation of the men on both sides. Also, a greater understanding of the rediculousness of it all. I mean, as far as some of the ideology of the soldiers. Stepping on toes is a thing of mine. Ofcourse, theologically, we have the benefit of hindsight. Blah.

Are there problems with the movie? Yeah. Are there problems with Citizen Kane and Fargo? Yeah. (grrr...afi) Some of the problems, as aforementioned by some, was the lack of display of the 20,000 Japanese. Ofcourse if history tells us that the soldiers were always scattered across the island, in caves etc..., one sweeping shot of massive bunched hordes would be an unfaithful recount.

Side Note: The Acting is Brilliant.

1602169,4,B00005JPKE,"Before I saw Letters from Iwo Jima, I had every expectation that I'd find it a great film, and much to my surprise, I did not. Oh, let me assure anyone who might stumble across this humbly submitted review that Letters from Iwo Jima is a good movie, but it doesn't merit the term ""great"" in the way that recent World War Two productions such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and HBO's Band of Brothers all do, and this revelation caught me off guard. Even amid the orgies of death and wasted self-sacrifice in Clint Eastwood's tale from the Japanese side of the front, we have a sort of cinematic version of World War Two-lite which has much in common with 2001's Enemies At The Gate, another genre film that aimed for something outside its grasp. To single out Letters' worst flaw I would say it felt rushed, and it lacked those on-screen qualities I can only term heart and soul.

The fact is Letters from Iwo Jima felt incomplete. It also seemed hollow. Whereas the real life battle of Iwo Jima involved many thousands of combatants on both sides, never when seeing this film did I ever witness more than a perhaps a score of Japanese soldiers grouped together, and even what could have been the immensity of the American landing on the shores of this mortally-contested protrusion of earth was underwhelming and hurried through. I felt I was seeing less an epic than an intimate project involving a miniscule company of players in an almost theatrical setting. I also felt let-down that the director ended the motion picture as he did, rapidly, abruptly, without meaningful closure. One more scene, even, of the featured Japanese survivor returning home to his wife and child would have added much depth to the climax of what was often simultaneously deep and shallow storytelling. Pacing was problematic all during this story, and nevermore than at its conclusion. Having anticipated much, I felt disappointed.

There were strong performances in Letters and there were a few memorable moments, but as I've twice pointed out, despite a long running time everything felt forced and impelled toward brevity. The scenes of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi's time spent among Americans in happier pre-war days were frustratingly brief and inexplicably under-explored. There were more things wrong with Letters from Iwo Jima than there were right, and that's not how it was supposed to be: not in a movie this acclaimed and with this much inter-continental talent involved.

1602171,3,B00005JPKE,"And you would have had a decent picture of the Japanese side of Iwo Jima.  But, a thoroughly unneccesary section of the film where first a captured Marine is treated humanely by Baron Nishi, and then shortly thereafter, surrendered Japanese prisoners are executed by another Marine, sits in politically correct smugness smack in the middle of an otherwise decent film.  It may make the ""anti-war"" message, but it rang false, and at that point the film faltered.  True, earlier a Marine captive was shown beaten and bayoneted, but this was juxtaposed with another Japanese being burned to death, as if the Marine captive was being punished for that death.  The reality of these battles was something else.

The historian William Manchester was a young Marine in the Pacific and in his book Goodbye Darkness, about his experiences, said that there was a tacit understanding between the Marines and Japanese in the island campaigns: neither side took many prisoners.  At least while the battle was raging.  That was just the way it was. Each campaign was a fight to the death.  He also pointed out that the Marines always had help from native islanders against the Japanese, not because the islanders loved Marines or even knew what an American was, but because they hated the Japanese because of their brutality toward these conquered peoples.

Too bad, because otherwise this was a fine film pretty fairly showing the view from the other side of the cultural divide.  It demonstrates the crazy waste and harshness of the Bushido code, most especially as it is sternly and unthinkingly applied to the average drafted Japanese soldier.  It illustrates how these unyielding notions caused the needless sacrifice of their own troops in forced personal suicide and suicidal frontal assaults on fixed positions.  It also showed the human dimension of these men left to do nothing else but die on that sulfurous rock.  I had no problems with those elements of the film that depicted the common humanity of men with families and love of their country.

I liked the view of the unconventional General Kuribayashi's strategy, often undone by the willfully obtuse views of his own officers, and the equally effective view of life as lived by the common soldier, often starved and beaten by these same latter day samurai.  The action scenes, as in Flags of Our Fathers, were well done and the production design I so admired in that film is, of course, still present here.

I liked the actors and the interplay between them.  I admire the production values and this is often a quiet and interesting film.  I certainly have no problem with seeing the flip side of the battle depicted in Flags of Our Fathers.  I think the film was doing quite well in depicting the humanity of soldiers who, by and large, would rather be home or anywhere else.  It didn't need any extra ""message"" slipped in, and while it might not bother others, I found it an unneccessary excess plea, and a bit disingenuous.  At any rate, the film is worth seeing.",1183680000,51,3018,4.844054580896686

For sure I do not know precisely what happened at Iwo Jima, all I know is that 22000 fought till only 216 remained. That is a victory. As big as the firefighters of 9/11. It is something, it seems that Clint Eastwood, that willingly directed this movie, will never understand. Having no choice in life but to die honorably.

Iwo Jima was a last-stand before the enemy reached Japan, much like the Alamo. Soldiers don't harbor anti-war sentiment when your home and family is threatened - you pull together. Fight and die together. I didn't get the idea that there were 22000 soldiers on the island. The American forces were realistically depicted.

1602219,2,B00005JPKE,"Faced with all the rave reviews I didn't write this review until after I re-viewed LFIJ. Seeing it again I came to the same sad conclusions of the first-time through; maybe even more so: I was disappointed; in fact, LFIJ just adds to my irritation of just-released hype phenomenon.

I admire and respect Clint Eastwood and his work; but this flick is superficial, stereotypical, monotonous and trite. I couldn't help comparing it to Terrance Malick's THE THIN RED LINE and Mel Gibson's WE WERE SOLDIERS; both were FAR superior (and highly recommended, especially the Malick film, which depicts Japanese soldiers in-depth and so dramatically, without a hint of soap-operatics and worn seen-before characterizing tricks.)

A baker with the pregnant wife who'd rather be home. A swash-buckling equestrian officer. A brutal sergeant. A noble, professional but family-loving commander, and - Well, ALL the Japanese characters were paper-thin cliche`s whatever their role. The obligatory back stories were oh-so familiar, and again, thin. And the payoffs as each character meets his fate seemed unattached, ambiguous and eminently unrevealing. It was like they tried to go for a moral and lost track of their point. (Yes much of war is pointless, but finding something dramatic and insightful to make that point is what movie art's about, isn't it?) Short form: Nothing in this movie surprised or enlightened me.

The scuttling through caves became monotonous (but I'm sure were big money-savers) and was edited into a numbing, drumming beat than just ran on and on. In all, the whole story-telling seemed flat, without originality or provocation.

My father-in-law, now ending his days in a VA hospital, was at Iwo Jima,
and just saw this movie. He said they got the barren look of the island (atoll?) right. But as to the scenario, he grunted ""Hollywood"". 'Bye Harry,
thanks for your daughter. And your right-on one-word review.

Oh, another war movie which dramatizes the characters of war, very early-on, was Samuel Fuller's THE BIG RED ONE; Amazon offers the expanded, once-censored version. It's fine, too. And if you really want a heavy hit of the personalities of wars and warriors, check out BAND OF BROTHERS; its ironies and moral dilemmas are dramatically displayed; again, far better than this cardboard cut-out of a movie.",1182902400,8,2329,5.16710875331565

The Blu-Ray disk quality is outstanding. Even when played on 480p (not and HD resolution), it appears brighter and fuller than standard DVD when played on a Playstation 3.

1602267,4,B00005JPKE,"I couldn't help feeling a big letdown when I watched Clint Eastwood's ""Flags"", after seeing this picture.  I had have expected to view this movie as more of a documentary, with lots of comments from ex-WWII Japanese vets.  I was pleasantly surprised when it presented the action, and drama of soldiers who know they have lost.  I was expecting to see the drama and carnage of the battle in Flags, and not a study is dissolution for those who were in the famous ""planting the flag"" picture.

Iwo Jima was a hard fought battle with tremendous losses on both sides.  The Japanese chose to give up the beaches, and defend from the high ground.  When the flag was planted, most thought the worst was over, but many times more casualties were realized after the big flag planting ceremony.  That's the story that was begging to be told. If the story in ""Flags"" was merely to convey the hypocrisy of the political war propaganda machine and its human price, as least they could have established that on the home front.  The movie ""Letters..."" handled that kind of conveying of emotion, almost seamlessly.

Motivations were better on display as well, the differing thoughts on saving face in a lost battle.  That it was better to die by one's own hand, or in a suicide charge rather than give yourself up to ones enemy.  One thing they really didn't capture was the mindset of the Japanese soldier, that American's were inferior as a race.  The attitude was touched on briefly in some of the Japanese dog soldier's conversation, but overall it was not apparent.  One thing they did do well, was put a human face on the act of war.  The soldiers who would have preferred the war be over, were just trying to survive their time.  Their wants and desires were depicted as essentially the same as most of us.

It was also not that much on display here, the brutality that has been attributed to the Japanese in battle.  Perhaps that's a behavior on display only when they win, but more likely it's a function of the leadership.  If the leaders have no respect for those which they conquer, their men can act with retribution, revenge and hatred.  In this story, some of the Japanese leaders had empathy for both their men, and even for America in some ways as the leader had spent time there and had American friends.  That made it difficult to think of them as sub-human.",1181779200,5,2360,4.587112171837709

1602270,5,B00005JPKE,"To say that ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is a great war film does it an injustice.  I found the film to be more of a tribute to humanity than a war picture.  It must have taken director Clint Eastwood a lot of courage, growing up under the specter of war, to make a film that humanizes the other side.  What Eastwood concerns himself here is the effects that the American assault on Iwo Jima had on the collective psyche of the Japanese fighting men.

1602324,4,B00005JPKE,"This film has been very popular in Japan where I teach.

My Japanese friend said that on the whole she thought the film was fairly accurate, but she did make the following critiques.

1). The gushy emotional letters the soldiers wrote home to their wives and children would have been unusual for Japanese men of that era.

2). She thought the frank talk by the common soldiers and some of the complaining they did was something more reflective of the American soldier than the Japanese. A Japanese soldier of that era wouldn't have dared to complain about his superiors even out of their earshot.

3). Likewise Watanabe Ken's character (the general) was too much like an American manager, who was concerned about the moral of his men and felt the need to explain his orders to his subordinates. A Japanese general, especially in that era, would have simply barked out his orders and assumed blind obedience. Perhaps the intended explanation for this was that Watanabe Ken's character had spent in America, but it still didn't smell right to She.

4). Lastly She claimed the dialogue in the movie was hard for her to catch at times, and theorized that since this movie was made for American's who would be reading the subtitles, speaking Japanese clearly wasn't a priority for the filmmakers. As for me, I can't tell one way or the other (from my perspective, any movie with Japanese dialogue is hard to catch). Since I haven't heard this criticism from anyone else, and since all the actors in this movie are professionals, and should in theory be able to speak clearly for the camera, I'm reporting this last one with a grain of salt.

I do not claim to have seen every Japanese movie under the sun, but there is an obvious difference in tone between this movie and a Japanese war movie like ""The Men of Yamato"". Both films may be arguable anti-war in their own ways (although I retain my reservations about ""The Men of Yamato""), but the disillusionment of the Japanese soldier and the criticism of the Japanese government were completely absent from ""The Men of Yamato"". In short, ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is probably a movie about that Japanese perspective of the war that could only be made in America.

Which doesn't completely invalidate it. The film still has a strong message even if it wouldn't be exactly the same way the Japanese would tell their own story. And as a movie made by Americans for other Americans, it does an excellent job of humanizing the enemy and trying to imagine the war from their perspective. And although this is not necessarily new (I'm told ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" showed the war from the Japanese perspective as well. And even ""Pearl Harbor"" shoehorned in a couple of scenes giving the Japanese perspective) it does represent a step in the right direction.

From a cinematic viewpoint I thought this film was a bit long to sit through. It could probably have done with some more time in the editing room. But still worth seeing.",1181433600,4,2960,4.711798839458414

My fears were twofold. First is that director Clint Eastwood lacks character development, and I was afraid he'd continue his trend with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. Second (and more recently noted within myself) is that I absolutely love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tora-Tora-Tora/dp/B000EHSVSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tora!

Although Tora focused on the Pearl Harbor attack and not Iwo Jima, it did look at both sides of the war (Japan and America.) I feared that Dirty Harry might muddy the film-waters of Tora! Tora! Tora!

Thankfully the latter didn't happen, but the former trend continues.

With the exception of Ken Watanabe's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha/dp/B000EHRVMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>) portrayal of General Kuribayashi and Kazunari Ninomiya's Saigo, there were few characters with which the audience could identify. We care little for any of these doomed men simply because we don't know them well enough. The story itself is historically interesting, of course, and it's well told. But the lack of empathy viewers will have for any of the characters will likely plague this film to its bitter end.

Where Tora! Tora! Tora! succeeded was not simply in its storytelling, but also in that we got in tight with everyone involved. From Martin Balsam's gruff Pacific Fleet Admiral to So Yamamura's demanding Vice-Admiral Yamamoto presence, all of the characters had some important measure within the film's scheme. Clint Eastwood seems to have had trouble doing this with two lengthy movies (Flags was 132 minutes long and Letters 141 minutes while Tora alone was just 144 minutes.)

The thing I don't want to do here is disrespect (in any way) what happened on this little spit of land in the Pacific. The horrors were real and Mr. Eastwood does a fair job showing us some pretty abhorrent conditions the Japanese were subjected to. Clint Eastwood is a fine filmmaker, but he's not the finest. And this is also where I have a beef with the Oscar board members.

This film is in a foreign language and yet it got nominated in the ""Best Picture"" category at last year's Oscars. I realize that the director is American, but that alone surely shouldn't dictate the category in which it's placed come awards time, should it? Almost all of the remaining awards ceremonies placed it in the ""Foreign Language"" category but not The Academy of Motion Picture Arts. A bit of cronyism going on?

It's a part of history everyone is beginning to forget and the story of the Japanese men on that island needs to be told, and with this film it is told quite well.

1602328,3,B00005JPKE,"""Letters from Iwo Jima"" presents the Battle of Iwo Jima, where American and Japanese troops clashed in 1945, from the Japanese point of view, as a companion piece to director Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of Our Fathers"", which addressed the American experience of the same battle. This film is partly based on letters written by Japanese who perished there, but many characters and conversations are fictional. Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) determines that a conventional beach defense of Iwo Jima will quickly fail and orders the creation of an extensive tunnel system and a northern defensive line. Kuribayashi's unorthodox strategy breeds dissent among his officers, while he prepares the troops to fight a losing battle against the approaching American armada. The trials and fears of the average soldier are represented by Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a reluctant but resigned Private, who thinks of his family back home and runs afoul of his strict superiors.

""Letters from Iwo Jima"" imbues Japanese soldiers with American values in order to make them sympathetic, and it posits the two wisest officers, General Kuribayashi and Lt. Colonel Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), as more enlightened for having had contact with American culture. This might be interpreted as American ethnocentrism, but I think that the implication is simply that these men are better-equipped to understand their enemy, because they are more worldly than many of their compatriots. Japan's isolation and ignorance of other cultures led to grave miscalculations during World War II. General Kuribayashi opposed the war with the United States that he died fighting. The familiar values that the soldiers reveal through their letters and interactions seem more like a missed opportunity to present the Japanese mindset than a serious cultural blunder.

Once I mulled over the film's obvious manipulations, however, I found that there was little else. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" presents a vague, impressionistic view of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We can't make out much of the Japanese strategy, what is going on, or how long it lasts. The battle lasted nearly 40 days, whereas the film gives the impression of about a week. This film ignores the Battle's salient points in favor of sentimentality: The Japanese soldiers are honorable, loyal men who would nevertheless rather be at home with their families than burned alive in a futile attempt to defend a useless little island. I never would have guessed. This doesn't do General Kuribayashi's daring strategy justice or comment on Japan's decision to sacrifice 20,000 men, without air or sea support, in a stalling tactic. The substance and drama are in the strategic decisions, rationale, and implications, which the film relegates to background. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" does everything it can to avoid pointed analysis and embrace cliches.

The washed-out color palette struck me from the first frame of the first scene. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is in color but desaturated to the point of nearly monochrome, like a faded old photograph. Desaturating the color can be useful in films where a lot of bright red blood would distract the audience from other elements. This palette isn't unattractive, but my eyes never got used to it. My mind involuntarily kept concentrating to make out the color. This was distracting. The other visually notable feature is the scenes of American Marines invading the beaches of Iwo Jima, which are quite beautiful, but alas do not look remotely real. They are obviously CGI. The cinematographic stylization is probably too heavy-handed for its own good, which would not be a first for Clint Eastwood.

The superficiality of ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" might not bother me if this material were not so rich in drama, irony, and insight: An opponent of war with America leads his troops to certain death against Americans. 20,000 men consigned to cannon fodder to buy a little time. Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi did not get along, which is more interesting than the trite friendship in the movie. A smart commander hampered by foolish underlings. A heroic defense of a hopeless cause. A completely different world view. Some Japanese soldiers lived in the tunnels for years afterward, because they didn't dare surrender. That would have made a nice epilogue if anyone really wanted to make a film about the Japanese perspective. And Iwo Jima was of no value to either Japan or the US. What could be better material for a thoughtful war movie? I was entertained by ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", but Clint Eastwood has managed to transform an incisive, disturbing moment in human history into something vague, mawkish, and utterly without substance.

1602329,5,B00005JPKE,"I missed this film when it was in theatres, so I am very glad I finally rented ""Letters From Iwo Jima"". It gives a viewer who - up until the time he watched it - only heard about how brutal the Japanese were during WWII - that they were monstrous fanatics during the war. Now, this may be true to some extent (and this applies to how they treated their own, as well as their enemies, as it turns out!). But, never have I ever been given such a glimpse into the more human side of the Japanese who defended the doomed island of Iwo Jima. They suffered, died, and struggled with their consciences while fighting for their country - same as their U.S. Marine adversaries did.

I also came to appreciate how - in their own strange way - the Japanese soldier fought under a certain code of honor. These guys came out to fight even when they knew they would all be killed. They didn't hide like cowards and plant bombs to be exploded as an enemy passed by.... like those who fight void of any sense of honor in certain regions of the world today.

I highly recommend that you watch ""Flags of Our Fathers"" in addition to - either before or after - ""Letters From Iwo Jima"". Both movies were filmed simultaneously, and the juxtaposition of viewpoints is nothing short of brilliant. Being an American, I want to say that I preferred ""Flags"" over ""Letters"". But, I have to concede that I think I like the latter film a little better.

The movie takes a huge left turn, exemplified by two scenes.  In the first, the Japanese are shown to risk their own lives to run into enemy fire to recover a wounded US soldier, then they treat him with the last of their morphine.  This is in contrast to the scene showing a US soldier shooting 2 unarmed, captured POW's who surrendered so the Americans would give them a meal.

Sure there's the significant cultural differences, and you can argue that they started the war, but once those bullets start flying, we all feel the same fear and bleed the same blood. Foot soldiers don't start wars, and only the hardest of hearts could watch this and not feel sympathy for these young men. Another reviewer called this an ""anti-bushido"" movie and I think there is some truth to that. One of the recurring themes seems to be the contrast between the common soldier who just wants to survive, and the hardcore bushido officers who believe in nothing less than death before dishonor. Personally, there's a part of me that sympathizes with the whole honor-driven samurai tradition, but I can see how many regard it as primitive and senseless. The cave scene with the grenades comes to mind. I also have to say that the score is one of the most touching I've heard in awhile also.

1602333,4,B00005JPKE,"Decoration Day or Memorial Day as it is now called is a day set aside to honor those who fought in all of the wars since the Civil War, wars in defense of country and citizens. While we languish over the misbegotten war on Iraq it is helpful to view the Clint Eastwood film LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and visit the mindset of the 'enemy' - the soldiers pointing weapons our way - in an attempt to understand the global effect of war on the battlefield.

Eastwood wisely pairs his disappointing 'Flags of our Fathers', which addressed the political 'war games' simultaneously with the combat on a small Japanese island in World War II, with a 'look at the other side' viewpoint. The same type of militarism, blind faith in the war machine, brutality, fear of dying, bonding among friends, the spectrum of 'good officers versus cruel inflexible officers, and the spectrum of humanity is equalized and the result is a moving drama that sheds needed light on how 'war' is a universal beast no matter one's stance.

The telling of the story with occasional letter contents is sound if somewhat over long. The screenplay by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis is based on Tadamichi Kuribayashi's ""Picture Letters from Commander in Chief"" - Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) being the film's chief character. Watanabe is excellent in his well-rounded approach to the role of the 'good commander' in both his wise military judgment and his kindness bestowed on the simplest of soldiers such as Saigo (the sensitive Kazunari Ninomiya). For many of us this is the first encounter with the vantage that the Japanese were minimally supplied and supported in defending their sacred Iwo Jima against the American aggressors: the battle was a doomed last stand for the Japanese despite all the casualties suffered by both sides. Eastwood does away with the 'kamikaze' stereotype of the Japanese soldier and allows us to see them as human beings, away form home, fighting to defend their country and their honor.

No one is right in war: circumstances and places vary from Europe, the Far East, the Middle East and here but horrors remain the same. It is good to be reminded of this, as in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, especially on Memorial Day. Grady Harp, May 07",1180310400,4,2226,4.806788511749347

Eastwood, to his credit, does not try to push your buttons in regard to the Japanese men on the island.

Ken Watanabe once again has such a commanding presence, like he did in The Last Samurai.  Here he plays General Kuribayashi, a wise commander whose unconventional methods causes much dissension down throughout the ranks.

What I found stunning with this character was his past relationship with America.  He had lived in America, had many close American friends, and had a genuine respect and admiration for the country he was forced to fight against.  He also knew the insurmountable odds stacked against him in this battle but was ready to die with honor for his country.

Letters from Iwo Jima really depicts the emotional hardships that come with any war.  Plus it has wonderful character development that really gives you no choice but to connect with soldiers on both sides.  It also spends the vast majority of time focusing on the war itself, which is another reason why I found this movie much more profound and enjoyable than Flags of our Fathers.

All those television commercials don't tell you that the movie is only available in Japanese, with optional English subtitles! For a movie marketed in the United States, no matter how `historically correct' it may or may not be, should be available in `English'!

Granted, some movies are meant to tell a story. But movies, whether fiction, non-fiction, action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, what-ever, are also to `entertain'. Sure, those movies that `may be' historically correct may teach correct events in history, however is the best way to do that is by reading subtitles on a television?

I mean, if I wanted to know any specifics about Iwo Jima, I'm sure I can find dozens of books I can read on that subject! I don't want to read subtitles on my television!

Even trying to view this movie, the subtitles that `pop up', doesn't stay there long enough to even read them.

Not unlike ""Flags of Our Fathers"", (which I was also extremely disappointed with as a movie), and which was offered along with this movie in a special two-pack edition, I fell asleep trying to watch both of these movies.

Sorry Clint, I know Japanese back in World War II, didn't speak English, but if you want to hold an audience, you have to do it in a language they can understand. Okay, throw in an `accent' in there to make it more real, if you need to, but `GEE' weren't lessons learned from Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" when that came out in a `non-English' version?

I'm sure this movie will do well in Japan, and in Japanese communities in the United States, but that is not where the biggest market is going to be! I don't want to `read' movies!

1602360,4,B00005JPKE,"To be honest, I was enthused to see Letters but not completely excited. I thought its companion Flags of Our Fathers was a dramatically empty war film that seemed manipulative as it was banal. Everyone was saying how great Letters From Iwo Jima was and while I knew it had to be better than Flags, I was curious as to the extent on how better it was. I sometimes find Clint Eastwood films (aside from Unforgiven) to be a little too emotionally distant and a bit too calculated. While a couple of points knock Letters down from being a classic war film, it's still better than anything since Saving Private Ryan.

Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai, Batman Begins) plays Koribayashi, a General stationed on island Iwo Jima during World War II. American forces are quickly approaching the island in hopes of taking it over and it doesn't help that the Japanese forces on the island are quite outnumbered and lack of support from the mainland makes things worse. Saigo is a young soldier who's not as battle-hardened and like many of the soldiers, he wants to get back to his wife and baby. But when 2 governments say war must go on, how do you end up stopping something you don't even want to be in in the first place?

I have to get the negative out of the way. The film has a slight sluggish pace to it. Even though we get scenes of character development as well as war scenes, the whole vibe feels a little bit more serious and maybe not as accessible. Ever watch a movie that just feels long? That's kind of what this felt like. Even though longer movies like Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now were lengthy, they never once felt their length whereas this film you get the feeling the world slowed down a tad. Granted, it is a war film and it's not meant to be some popcorn fun, when you consider films about war being better paced, you kind of notice it here.

One problem I always have with Paul Haggis scripts (Million Dollar Baby, Flags and notably Crash) is just how fleshed out the characters feel. His and other scripts by other writers have what I call ""plot puppets"": characters that don't really live and breathe that we care for but rather just tools to say dialogue and deliver dramatic scenes without the emotional backing to support it. Letters corrects that very problem Flags suffered from and we feel a lot more for these soldiers this time. Maybe it was that film's more recognizable cast or maybe here they just feel more complex than the other film.

Even though it's about an entirely different conflict, it's hard not to compare Letters to Spielberg's Private Ryan, what with the color desaturation but you can make a case that this is probably one of the better crafted war films lately.",1179792000,5,2711,4.5378323108384455

1602362,5,B00005JPKE,"Director Clint Eastwood has followed up his highly successful ""Flags of our Fathers"" with a film that looks at the Battle of Iwo Jima entirely from the Japanese perspective.  In that vein, ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" gives the viewer an entirely new look at the battle, and perhaps a new perspective of the Japanese soldiers who were defending the island.

Ken Watanabe stars as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.  He was put in charge of formulating a defense of Iwo Jima.  Kuribayashi was not the typical Japanese General.  He worried greatly about the well-being of his family and the men under his command.  He refused to eat special rations; rather, he insisted on eating the same food as the soldiers.  He routinely made inspections on foot rather than from a vehicle.  And, perhaps most importantly, he didn't abide by the Japanese bushido code.  Upon taking command, he set about re-formulating Iwo's defenses from a beachhead defense to a complex system of tunnels and caves.  These would prove most difficult for the Americans to break.

Kazunasi Ninomiya stars as Saigo, a young Japanese soldier who is part of Iwo's garrison.  He was told at his home that he was drafted into the army.  This news greatly disturbed his wife, who was pregnant at the time of Saigo's induction.  He worked as a baker before being drafted, and he had several run-ins with the Japanese secret police.  Now, realizing that the war is hopelessly lost, he longs to be back with his family.

As the movie goes along, the American invasion draws nearer.  The Japanese fortifications are strong, and on D-Day, the Americans suffer many casualties due to Kuribayashi's defenses.  However, it is soon clear to the Japanese that the battle cannot be won.  Many men commit suicued by blowing themselves up with grenades rather than surrender.  Saigo and another Japanese soldier even decide to surrender rather than commit suicide or die of starvation, but the attempt is foiled.  Saigo's friend manages to surrender, but Saigo is caught and taken back to his unit.  His friend is eventually shot by two American soldiers who don't want to watch over him.

In the end, Kuribayashi leads an attack against the American positions, only to be severely injured by shrapnel.  As he lay dying, he pulls out his pearl-handled pistol, a gift from friends in the United States, and shoots himself.  Saigo, who was told by Kuribayashi to bury him, is eventually captured by the Americans, but he ended up surviving the battle.

This is a fantastic movie.  Clint Eastwood has went a step beyond ""Flags"" with this movie.  Although I liked ""Flags"" very much, I enjoyed ""Letters"" more.  Ken Watanabe delivers an Oscar-caliber performance as Kuribayashi, while Ninomiya's portrayal of Saigo is just as good.  The battle scenes are very realistic, and it is sobering to see that many of the Japanese soldiers were not evil killing machines; on the contrary, they were very much like the Americans; scared and missing their homes and loved ones.

I give this film my highest recommendation.  Clint Eastwood has crafted a masterpiece that is sure to become a classic.",1179792000,8,3122,4.932821497120921
1602363,4,B00005JPKE,"A complimentary film to ""Flags of Our Fathers"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" uses many of the same techniques (including flashbacks during sequences where the soldiers are reading letters from loved ones or where they are thinking of events that occurred prior to their being stationed on the sparsely populated resource poor island) as that film but manages to touch on the personal much better than ""Flags"". Perhaps its Eastwood's perspective as an outsider to Japanese culture that made him more attuned as a director to these characters in ""Letters"" either way this film manages to get under the skins of the various characters much more successfully than ""Flags"" did. Although not as complex in terms of technique, ""Letters"" is every bit as complex emotionally as its companion piece. Perhaps the less complex storytelling structure allows Eastwood to dig a big deeper under the surface of these characters either way the two films when seen together are much richer than either one alone.

Focusing much of its time on Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) a young reluctant recruit and the Japanese Commander Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) who must try and hold Iwo Jima with limited resources and no support from Japan, the film tells their desperate attempt to hold the island despite their bleak chances of success at fighting the massive American contingent arriving by sea and air. Eastwood manages to convey the fear, doubt and bravery of these soldiers as they tunnel into the mountainside of Iwo Jima taking an unconventional defense tactic which given the massive forces they face is the only chance that they have for success. Holding out for almost six weeks against superior fire and man power, Kuribayashi and his troops beat the odds putting up a heroic fight against a technological and resource superior adversary. Eastwood doesn't sugar coat the battle or the difficulties that both sides face in either film and doesn't glorify the cost of war. World War II may have been the last noble war that the United States was involved in but that doesn't make the cost of war noble or acceptable. There are always heroes on both sides of the battle regardless of whose ideology was right and on the field of battle there isn't right or wrong--just a desperate attempt to fight for your own survival amid the larger concerns that exist outside a small island in the South Pacific Ocean.

Like ""Flags"", ""Letters"" looks extremely good in its transfer to DVD. The muted color scheme and look of the film add to the vividness as well as sense of reality that is essential to recreate the world from 60 plus years ago. Audio brilliantly conveys the ambiance of the island and the heat of battle with well placed sound effects. A warning for those expecting another war film in English--this is presented (with the exception of a few scenes) in Japanese since that's what the soldiers spoke. The film is subtitled in English with Spanish and French subtitles available as well.

Unlike ""Flags"", ""Letters"" appears as a ""special edition"" from the get-go. While we don't get a commentary track (Eastwood has shied away from doing a commentary track for years and its probably just as well since he's a man of few but well chosen words), we get a number of terrific extras on the second disc. ""Red Sun, Black Sand: The Making of `Letters from Iwo Jima'"" is a terrific documentary on the making of the film allowing Eastwood and his team to discuss what drove them to create this companion piece and the complex challenges of filming two very similar films from different perspectives back-to-back.

""The Faces of War"" presents the cast introducing and discussing the characters they play in the film. For me it was the second most interesting extra here since even though familiar with military history often do not see the individual faces of the ""enemy"". Since history is often written by the victory of any battle, these individuals who fought for their country with as much passion as the Allies did for theirs are often overlooked and forgotten.

Perhaps Eastwood's two epics would have fared better at the Oscars if they had been presented theatrical as one epic film since the two require each other as counterpoints. Either way, the two together have much more impact than either alone although of the two I found ""Letters"" to be the more compelling piece simply because we saw a side we rarely see if films about World War II focusing on the enemy. Watching the two films back-to-back was an exhausting experience but ultimately more rewarding for me since they dovetail quite nicely in their examination of the personal cost of war on the people who actually fight it and don't glorify the horrors of war. Eastwood continues to show amazing growth and talent as a film director proving that director's careers don't necessarily have to burn brightly and fade away as many of our top talents have.

I'd suggest the deluxe set which has an extra disc with a History Channel documentary and short from WWII.

1602393,5,B00005JPKE,"This was an excellent movie and a credit to Eastwood. The Flag of our Fathers book falsely portrayed the Marines as good little boy scouts. Here they are shown shooting prisoners out of hand and looting corpses. Not a bad reality check even if it is balanced by naughty Japanese scenes.

There are some good touches like the General and his men listening on the wireless to little Japanese schoolgirls singing their praises even as they face the end. Contrary to an earlier review, I thought the captured marine scene was good.  Although the US mom's letter was a take off from Apocalypse Bow and the German general in Band of Brothers, the Japanese guy asking if he knew Douglas Fairbanks and producing the photo of his horse was a classic. The Japanese scenes of hopeless women and children and stupid secret policemen (shooting a dog for God's sake) were also good. Movies are not documentaries and if little vignettes resonate with us, the movie achieves what a documentary cannot,

Far from being a reaction to bushido, I feel the Japanese have a thirst to learn about their history. History is not taught in schools and the TV only shows samurai movies, which are like spaghetti westerns on a bad day. More generally, it is good to see a non English speaking movie and such great actors. It speaks volumes for Eastwood that he could make such a masterpiece.",1179705600,3,1363,4.694560669456067
1602394,5,B00005JPKE,"This is an outstanding production that shows the defenders of Iwo Jima in a much more human light.  Previous movies that dealt with Iwo Jima, including Flags of Out Fathers, didn't really show the defenders.  This film redresses that imbalance to some degree.

General Kuribayashi's tactics were excellent in a loosing cause.  His regard for America is well known and shown in flash backs without being heavy handed.  His interaction with the wife of an American officer during a social function is quite impressive.  The film demonstrates that not only was the general preparing to fight the Americans who were sure to land on Iwo Jima but he also had to fight his superiors in Tokyo and subordinates on Iwo Jima.  That he did as well as he did is a tribute to his leadership.

Through the use of two privates, Saigo and Shimizu we see the other end of the Japanese military system.  Saigo is a conscript baker who is the opposite of the sterotypical Japanese warrior.  His inability to hit the target is punished by his officer with the order to clean every man's boots in the commnad.  Kuribayashi witnesses this incident and thinks out load that cleaning the rifles might be more prodcutive.  This same officer disobeys the order to evacuate the tunnels under Suribachi and orders the deaths of his men.  Saigo and a companion disobey and leave the tunnels.  Saigo has several interactions with Kuribayashi and ultimately performs a final service for his general.

Shimizu is a thrown out member of the Japanese military police (kempetai) who is sent to Iwo Jima after failing to carry out an order.  He too is disillusioned with the army and is determined to surrender at the first opportunity.  He does so and unfortunately for him is left by his captors under the supervision of two Marines, one of which shoots his two prisoners of war.  A small detail but serves to illustrate that not all brutalities against prisoners were carried out by the Japanese.

The filming in almost a black and white style with minimal color was excellent.  It demonstrates the desolation of the island and it's being cut off from the rest of Japan.  You can almost feel the heat and humidity as the soldiers dig into Suribachi and the surrounding ground.  It is quite effective.

The film demonstrates the futility of this battle for the Japanese.  It also deomonstrates the bankrupt decision making process in Tokyo.  The Japanese fleet, which was supposed to assist in the defense of the island had been essentially wiped out in mid-1944 and while Kuribayashi knew this, the leaders on the island didn't.  This little detail was not relayed to Iwo Jima.  Kuribayashi relieves the admiral commanding naval forces on the island and sends him back to Tokyo to tell the general staffs of the conditions on Iwo Jima yet with the knowledge there is little that can be done for the isolated island.

Saigo manages to survive the battle.  When last seen he is on a stretcher on the beach awaiting evacuaiton to a US ship.  At least one person, although fictional, survives to see his wife and daughter again we presume.  He is representative of the handful of survivors of the Japanese army and navy who were able to return to a totally destroyed Japan.

I might have a skewed perspective of this event since I am living in Japan and have been watching the desire of some in Japan to reinvigorate the armed forces of Japan.  There are still some ultranationalists who have been unwilling to learn or remember from the mistakes of the past.  I see these events in the here and now and then see the disaster of Iwo Jima and realize that for some today they seem intent on learning nothing and remembering nothing.  Letters. . . is a good reminder of what the corrupted form of Bushido that was practiced in the years before and during World War II by the Japanese military resulted in.

I urge everyone to see this film and reflect on the outcome and the cost to both sides.  It is an excellent complement to Flags of Our Fathers.",1179273600,10,4010,4.6852646638054365
1602395,4,B00005JPKE,"I saw this movie on the big screen, and now own it on DVD.  It is a really good movie, although you will probably find the constant reading of subtitles while trying to take in the action quite a challenge, but then watching it on DVD allows you certain controls that you do not have at a Theatre.  I went into that movie with a long instilled hatred of the Japanese because I saw result of what they did to my Uncle who was a prisoner in Changi during WWII. But after watching the movie, I walked out realising that they treated their own soldiers with the same barbarity and cruelty that they did their prisoners.  The Japanese were in no position to show any form leniency to any prisoner, especially when they refused to show any to their own soldiers.

Although I will never forgive or forget what these people had done to my family, I do have a better understanding of why. It was insightful, action packed, and a great watch!",1179273600,3,932,4.369942196531792

The Japanese at this point of the war had to be running on false hopes of some miraculous  change in their fortunes. A change that would never deliver them from the fate that was quickly moving to devour them. Their willingness to persevere in the face of certain and overwhelming defeat confirms their reputation as brave and determined opponents.

What the film does so well is to present their individual failings and humanity. They become much more than merely the enemy. They're recognizable personalities who have been thrust into the maw of an industrialized killing machine, without hope of escape.",1179014400,16,746,4.96
1602397,5,B00005JPKE,"...and a fantastic companion piece to ""Flags of our Fathers"". I actually think it's the better film between the two.

On the surface, attempting to let U.S. audiences see the battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Japanese could be a tricky endeavor.

But the director (and English dialog) quickly immerse you in the period, the patriotism and the palpable taste of the war. These guys know they are on a hopeless mission, but their never-ending pride for country keeps them going, and keeps you hooked.

This movie is much more engaging than ""Flags of our Fathers"". From the beginning, you quickly start to understand the relationship between the characters, and it lures you in.

My favorite crossroads in this movie is when the Japanese troops spy the American soldiers raising the flag at Mount Suribachi. This provides the clearest reference point to ""Flags of our Fathers"".

All in all, an engaging movie that deserves to be seen in Blu-Ray HD.

1602398,5,B00005JPKE,"*no spoilers*

Clint Eastwood gave us history, patriotism and courage in his 2006 film ""Flags of our Fathers."" He is back now to show us a different insight from that important battle, but this time we get to see behind enemy lines. The Battle of Iwo Jima is now shown from the Japanese perspective in his new film ""Letters from Iwo Jima."" We recommend this film due to its excellent plot, realism, acting and drama.

Brief story:

The beaches look calm and peaceful in present day Iwo Jima. Groups of Japanese scientists are investigating a network of tunnels that their soldiers dug up before the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Suddenly they find something interesting in the soil and begin to dig up. As they dig, the movie takes us back in time to 1945, days before that fateful battle.

Japanese General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arrives at the island and begins to plan new strategies to protect it against the American occupation. Unfortunately, many of his troops believe that this battle is lost. They are going against a better equipped and more powerful military force. The General also knows that the war is not going well for his country--he is bombarded with bad radio news from the mainland about the war--but that doesn't stop him from doing his duty honorably. The battle begins and all the Japanese soldiers shift to surviving mode.

Review:

Clint Eastwood is back with another epic film where we witness the crude reality of World War II once again. This time around, we get to see the war through the eyes of Japanese soldiers. These brave men who sacrificed everything and fought until the end to protect their island. A small island indeed, but yet crucial for both sides, especially for the Land of the Rising Sun. The Japanese side gives us history, patriotism and courage of its own. We see some of their motives, fears and dreams through flashbacks--something that Clint used heavily in ""Fathers""--but done better this time. We get to understand what the word ""honor"" means to them. Although these two enemies are from different parts of the world, they share similarities like; insecurity, fear of the unknown, patriotism, rage against their enemy, but they also share compassion for one another and strong family values.

The acting is what makes this movie very realistic. Ken Watanabe gives us an excellent performance as the real-life General Kuribayashi. He is a man of honor who must fight his enemy as well as his own demons--his character reminds us a little bit of Katsumoto from The Last Samurai.

The look and feel of the film is virtually the same as ""Fathers"" where Clint used a dark--almost black & white color--filter. The battle scenes are shown with intensity. The camera work is dynamic and the overall photography is impressive--something that you would definitely expect from a Clint Eastwood film.

Unfortunately the movie suffers from the same illness as ""Fathers."" Both movies feel longer than they really are due to the draggy editing and talky moments--we believe that the use of flashbacks is something that Clint needs to minimize.

The Verdict:

The Battle of Iwo Jima is remembered as a great victory for America--and rightly so--but there is more to tell. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" gives us the opportunity to see beyond the American version by focusing on the Japanese one. If you saw ""Flags of our Fathers,"" you won't be disappointed by this companion film--which surpasses the first one in almost every level.",1176681600,22,3476,4.894557823129252
1602399,4,B00005JPKE,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", from the standpoint of a well-crafted movie with excellent acting performances and casting, brilliantly subdued cinematography, and a haunting musical score. In all respects, this is a thoughtful and engrossing movie, and imbued with an ever-present melancholy about soldiers committed to an island battle that they knew would be their last.

My only dissatisfaction with ""Letters"", as a student of military history and WWII in particular, was the decision to downplay the legendary ferocity of the 6 week conflict in favor of ""behind-the-scenes"" portrayals of the Japanese soldier's inner conflicts and longings for better times. I appreciate Eastwood's attempt to remind us that all human beings share similar longings for home, for family, and for peace- especially during the surreal happenings of war.....but one should also remember that much of the movie's direction came from letters written by Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima during the conflict, unearthed many years later. All soldier's letters, from the beginning of time, reveal the common threads of humanity in Americans, Japanese, Germans, whatever....but they also rarely dwell on the brutal and harrowing realities of the conflict at hand.

All the histories of Iwo Jima that I have read, including many with eye-witness accounts of the struggle, are replete with images of the ferocity of the struggle, and the tenacity of the Japanese defenders, as well as the unbelievable acts of individual heroism on both sides. 20,000 Japanese were sent to Iwo to defend it to the last- somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 or less survived. Most of the rest died fighting.

My only complaint with ""Letters"" was that it gave little sense for the struggle itself. It portrays the defense of Mount Suribachi as almost a walk in the park for the Marines- though eye witness accounts are rather different- the top of the mountain was fairly secure by the time the Marines reached the summit for the famous flag raising(s), but the several days before that were ones of round-the-clock desperate fighting at the base of the mountain. Many Marine accounts recall those several days as the worst fighting they experienced in the whole Pacific theatre. The movie gives almost no sense of that.

Likewise, after Suribachi fell, the struggle went on for almost 6 more weeks, filled with desperate cave-by-cave fighting, with the Japanese resisting to the end. Yes, there were many ritual suicides documented by the Marines(especially in the caves of Suribachi), but the rest of the island was a two-way death struggle that ultimately took 7,000 American lives. ""Letters"" dwells a bit too much on the ""quiet moments"" underground- my impression from reading the histories is that those moments were precious few. The movie does honor the humanity of the individual Japanese soldier, but I think it also sells the Japanese soldier's tenacity and bravery quite short.

The letters that were recovered do tell a story, but only a small part.

The letters that were never written tell a story too. Most of the 20,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo were too busy to write.",1176422400,14,3153,5.1484375
1602400,2,B00005JPKE,"and it bored me to death by watching it. and there were lot of movies about the second world war, but this movie unfortunately carried the most boring and dead-beat storyline. while 'flag of our fathers' was full of hollow parties and big words, 'letters from iwo jima' was even worse, not just boring, but subtly insert a message to let you see how cruel and abusive the japanese high ranking officers were to their subordinate soldiers. there almost nothing worth to be seen in this hollow and boring movie. i just have to say that both the 'flag' and the 'letters' sucked big time. they were two of the worst movies in my viewing experience, and they didn't even deserve my time to write reviews, because it's simply dumb after i've already wasted almost over 5 hours sitting through them.",1175817600,8,792,4.624113475177305
1602401,5,B00005JPKE,"This film blows away all the stereotypes that Americans have been fed over the last half-century about the Japanese.  Yes, Clint Eastwood is an American director.  But the film ""feels"" Japanese, and it's not only because, with the exception of just a scene or two, it is entirely in the Japanese language.  It's because the Japanese deeply-held tradition of dying with honor is so clearly depicted, so much so that it was easy for me to understand and identify where they were coming from.

The film opens in the present day, as a cache of letters is discovered and carefully dug up.  I understand that some of these letters really do exist and had been published recently in Japan.  These letters form the narrative structure of the film.  It works very well.

The rest of the film takes place in 1944, and  here we get to meet a full spectrum of Japanese soldiers.  We identify with them.  We feel their suffering as they all realize that this is truly their last stand and that are all going to die.  There is hunger, there is fear, there is discipline.  And, most clearly, there are their individual reactions to what is going on around them.  Ken Watanabe is cast as the General.  Kazara Ninomiya is cast as a young soldier who yearns to return to his wife and baby daughter.  And then there are all the other men -- the officer who was once an Olympic equestrian and had visited America, the young man who was sent to the front because he was too softhearted to be in an elite troop, and all of those who chose suicide missions or death by their own hands over surrender.  It is a huge and sad story.  I am glad it has been finally told in its entirety.

The battle of Iwo Jima was a decisive one.  The Americans sent 100,000 men to rout out the Japanese soldiers who saw Iwo Jima as a part of Japan and were defending the Island.  Seven thousand Americans died, 20,000 were wounded.  And of the 20,000 Japanese defending the Island, only about 1,000 of them survived. The film seems to be shot in black and white and so, in a way, it seems like a film that might have been made during those early war days.  However, this is the year 2007 and graphic artists have mastered the techniques of working with colors.  And so, the color saturation varies scene by scene.  Some of the scenes inside the caves seem to have a warm red glow.  And during the battle scenes, the flames erupt in bright yellows and orange.  Other times, the faces of the men are in shadow or half shadow.  All of this certainly enhanced the realism and the mood.

""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is a masterpiece.  And yet, it is not for everybody.  The subtitles alone might dissuade some.  And inevitable sad ending will keep others away.  But students of history and human nature will applaud the genius of it all.  And a story that needed to be told is now available for world-wide audiences.",1175299200,59,2865,4.446153846153846
1602402,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters From Iwo Jima depicts the Japanese side of the battle on Mount Suribachi.  The film is an attempt to portray the humanistic qualities of Japanese soldier, and not so much focus on the ravage combat scenes that occurred on the island but rather the activities inside the crevasses of the caves that the soldiers occupied at an attempt to maintain Japanese possession of Mount Suribachi.  There are similar battle scenes that were shown during Flags of Our Fathers, but the emphasis is the soldiers.

Eastwood focuses on two of the characters, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and a baker and young soldier, Saigo (Kaizunari Ninomayi), and parallels their lives and to the war experience.  Through short conversations and long silences and interactions between Japanese soldiers and American soldiers, Eastwood is effective in conveying the Japanese perspective.  Certain scenes may shock and disturb viewers who are not familiar with the events that coincided with what occurred during the Pacific War - a war heavily fought with psychological warfare and propaganda in mind.  For example, as Japanese soldiers talk about American soldiers they too describe them as savage and inhumane.  Where have we heard that before?  They were depicted in propaganda cartoons, which spread racist and jingoist fervor within the minds of those who believed it.  But what is interesting about this film as well as Flags of Our Fathers is that both raises questions about morality, sacrifice, and brutality among enemy combatants as well as concerns of human rights during times of war.

Bottom line, Letters From Iwo Jima is revisionist history, which revises one's perception of Japanese and American soldiers during World War II.  Eastwood emphasizes the humanistic qualities of each soldier portrayed in the movie including the commanding officer of the Japanese army, which show that they too were human; they too left family behind and hastily wrote letters home to loved ones.  There are subtle scenes of humor in the film, but with a tinge of irony, such as when a few soldiers suffer extreme cases of dysentery, but are able to laugh about it.  And another is with Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), a debonair and ""playboy-like"" officer, who oddly enough lands on the island with his prized horse.  Scenes involving Nishi is a short respite from the battle front, and this is displayed as he comforts a wounded American soldier from Oklahoma, Sam, that he takes in as a prisoner of war and nurses the soldier's wounds despite the dismay from Japanese soldiers.  In the little time that he spends with Sam, he shares with him a little piece of information about his own life when he was an Olympic athlete during the 1932 Olympics in California, possibly an equestrian, who happened to know two Hollywood actors of the day, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.  What is ironic about this scene is a preceding scene in which another American soldier was dragged into the Japanese army's cave, but suffered a much greater consequence.

Letter From Iwo Jima is an intense film filled with unanswered inquiries, which opens the door for discussion.  Undeniably, the film raises the controversial issue of revisionist history within the context of American and Japanese history, and uncovers stereotypes and misconceptions.  This film is recommended viewing for anyone interested in having a better understanding of the Pacific War and history in general.",1173657600,38,3458,5.153846153846154
1602432,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters from Iwo Jima is well scripted and acted. Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya were fantastic.

While perhaps not popular with people of the WWII generation, the strength of thi film is that it shows the battle for the island from the Japanese point of view. The film humanizes the Japanese without engaging in revisionism or political correctness. In it we see the ""enemy"" as men with wives, children, many of whom would rather not be fighting, but who love their country and cherish their ""honor."" Letters doesn't attempt to justify the Japanese position during the war.  Rather, it reminds us that, on an individual level, the Japanese were probably not much different than their American enemies (at least in terms of their hopes, dreams, aspirations, etc.)

The cast seemed sparse, giving it something of a low budget feel.  It was filmed through very dark lenses, or so it would appear. It's a color film that has so little color that it looks as if it were shot in B&W. Contrast that with Flags of Our Fathers, which was very colorful and bright.

There are several shots of American airplanes and what appears to be the entire Pacific fleet approaching the island. The panoramic shots of the approaching US fire power, is almost breathtaking, certainly awe-inspiring.

Comparisons to its brother film, Flags of our Fathers, are unavoidable.  In virtually all categories or measures, Letters is the better of the two films.  If you liked Flags, you'll really like Letters.",1173312000,11,1485,4.93574297188755

1602434,4,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood's epic ""Letters from Iwo Jima"", an emotional documentary style tribute to the Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima should be viewed as a snapshot into a horrific, dehumanizing episode of history rather than for purely entertainment value.

Eastwood portrays the battle through the eyes of commanding General Kuribayashi played by Ken Watanabe and a pair of conscripts humble former baker Saigo played by Kazunari Ninomura and disgraced military academy cadet Shimizu played by Ryo Kase.  Using bleached almost colorized black and white cinematography which enhanced the representation of the bleak terrain,  Eastwood mixes dialogue with excerpts from letters unearthed from Japanese soldiers years later to tell the tale.

Watanabe arrives on the island ordered to defend it as a strategic and essential buffer to homeland security, at all costs.  The organized and compassionate general quickly alters the slipshod preparation already made for the upcoming invasion gaining the respect of his men.  Digging a series of honeycombed caves in the volcanic rock, the soldiers hole up and await their fate.  Watanabe soon however learns of a series of devastating military defeats which dooms the ability to reinforce Iwo Jima.  He conveys the suicide nature of their defense to the defenders and what plays out is a touching depiction of how the men deal with their tragic situation.

Amid a dizzying display of brutal combat and intense psychological turmoil, we gain empathy for the Japanese ordered to fight to the death.  With the revelation through their letters that their thoughts and feelings are identical to their American enemies, Eastwood gives us a previously unconsidered respect for the condemned Japanese troops.",1172361600,12,1734,5.412639405204461
1602435,5,B00005JPKE,"This movie is arguably the best movie of 2006.  It's complete & comprehensive.  Who would have thought that Clint Eastwood betters himself every year in the craft of movie making? I have to say that ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is sublime.  For audience who have watched the American side in ""Flag of our Fathers"", this offering is able to fill some holes in the first movie. Whilst the first movie is more intense in battle scenes, this second movie goes the other way.  It focuses more on intimate scenes of Japanese soldiers hiding in underground caves and trenches to conduct guerilla warfare similar to ones used by VietCong during Vietnam War writing letters to their loved ones.  Here, we could understand why the Japanese lost the battle even before it had begun.  Most Japanese officers were deeply entrenched in the belief of death before dishonour and they would opt for gungho showdown rather than conserving resources to fight via element of surprises. Watanabe Ken is fabulous as the worldly General who'd been ordered to lead the Japanese side when most of his officers were disagreeing and disobeying his orders anyhow.  He's protrayed as a humane General who would perform his duty with courage, dignity and integrity despite of his yearning to go home safely to his family.  As Japanese force was severely depleted, there weren't any reinforcement and resources left to complement his strategies to undermine the American side.  Compounded by mass suicide of his soldiers as ordered by mutinied officers, he's fighting a losing battle and he knew it.  Audience bonded with two reluctant soldiers, Saigo  who was originally a baker & was coerced to become a soldier when the numbers were running thin; Shimizu, an ex-Kempeitai (akin to German's much feared Gestapo) who was sent to Iwo Jima because he wasn't tough enough.  They were torn between responsibilities to their Emperor & their country versus their longing to return home safely to their families.  There, there's also Nishi, an Olympic horsejumper who in his heydays would host party for Mary Pickford & Douglas Fairbank and who would volunteer himself to serve his country and a humanist officer; Ito, an inflexible militant akin to Tojo Hideki who would order his troops to their deaths just to win the battle. Here, we witnessed Americans soldiers gunned down Japanese soldiers even though they surrendered themselves, Japanese officers killing their own kinds just because they opted not to fight anymore, how some captured American soldiers were treated humanely in captivity by Japanese and some would be bayonetted & tortured cruelly. Certain scenes were deeply disturbing such as suicides with grenades, flamethrowers that gobbled everything and everyone along their paths. This is where war raises its ugly head and the time when we contemplate and asking why there need to be war at the first place.  It's ironic having a war movie suggesting an anti-war message.  This monochrome movie concludes rightfully with sunrise in glowing orange suggesting that the worst's over and a better promise & hope for future generations.  As read in the book, Ken's character ended up committing hara-kiri whilst to make it poetic in this movie, he used a pistol to kill himself that's been gifted to him during his stay in America.  An unmissable experience and an unforgettable movie. It's very rare a movie would give me lumps in my throat and what a sight to witness to see so many teary faces and people being contemplative in the cinema as end credit rolls.  Keep up the good work, Clint!",1172275200,19,3564,5.001692047377326

If the closing credits didn't identify Clint Eastwood as the director of ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" you might be forgiven for believing you were watching an actual Japanese war film like ""Burmese Harp"" or ""Fires on the Plain"" - not merely because the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles but because the movie has a starkness of vision and an intimacy of scope uncharacteristic of mainstream American movie-making. This is Eastwood's flip-side companion piece to the earlier ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" which told the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the American point of view. For this film, Eastwood has shrunk his canvas considerably, populating it with fewer familiar faces and restricting the action almost entirely to the island itself. Indeed, it is this very air of claustrophobia that makes ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" a more cohesive, personal and meaningful work than the earlier fine film.

As the movie begins, the Japanese army is preparing for an American assault on the island. The film focuses on two main characters, one from the upper echelons of the military and one from the grunt class. The former is Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a Lieutenant General who is sent to the site to take command of the forces for the battle to come. Kuribayashi is a compassionate pragmatist who has to deal not only with the enemy battering away at the island with the relentless fury of heavy artillery but the suicidal tendencies of his own men, many of whom subscribe to the belief that it is more honorable to commit hara-kiri than to endure the ignominy of defeat or surrender. The common soldier's eye view is provided by Saigo, a private reluctantly drafted into the army, who would much rather be back at home with his wife and baby daughter than digging trenches on some godforsaken rock in the middle of nowhere, and who feels less eager than his compatriots to sacrifice his life in service of his country.

By limiting their scope, Eastwood and screenwriter Iris Yamashita - working from the actual letters Kuribayashi and others sent home from the island - show us the horrors of war on a more personal scale than we generally find in films of this type. We come to identify with the desperation felt by 20,000 soldiers trying to fend off a force of 100,000 without benefit of naval or air support, virtually assured that none of them would ever make it off the island alive. The superb actor Ken Watanabe invests Kuribayashi with a confidence and compassion that makes us understand why the men under his command respect and follow him, and Kazunari Ninomiya perfectly embodies the contradictory nature of the everyman soldier. Torn between duty to self and duty to country, Saigo does what is asked of him yet evinces a much stronger commitment to self-preservation than do many of his buddies who seem all too eager to fall on the sword (or, the modern equivalent, a grenade) to avoid humiliation at the hands of the enemy. Ninomiya, with his openhearted demeanor and impish expression of boyish innocence, provides the emotional center the film needs to connect with the audience.

As with ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" cinematographer Tom Stern has bled so much of the color out of the picture that we seem almost to be watching a black-and-white movie, a technique that greatly enhances the bleakness of both the setting and the situation.

""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is not a film designed to appeal to the yahoos in the audience; it is, rather, a stripped-down, thoughtful and artful consideration of the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of ""the enemy.""",1172102400,3,3581,4.844771241830065
1602438,5,B00005JPKE,"In order to appreciate my review of this film, I want you to picture the conditions in which I saw it: I was late to the theater, and the place was packed (6:30 showing on a Saturday night at a popular mall). My fiancee and I were relegated to the very, very front seats--the ones no one sits in--to the far right of the auditorium. We were probably less than ten feet from the screen. It was then that we discovered that the entire film was in subtitles; my fiancee later commented that we had to create our own ""Pan and Scan"" to watch the film. Consider also: 2 and a half hours long. My neck was aching from about minute 10.

And yet...

I really enjoyed the movie. At 2 1/2 hours, it never felt long. I didn't regret being so close, usually enough to make any movie unbearably awkward. This is a smart, powerful film, engrossing from start to finish, and it made me lose myself to my surroundings, to join with the soldiers striving to defend their homes on a poor island in the Pacific.

Specifically, it's the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, and of the commander who had to wage an impossible battle. Against the American forces? Perhaps, but really the impossible battle was against his own troops and culture, which were of a tradition-bound mentality that severely tied his hands.

Beyond war, it's also a human story, as the ""letters"" give us background on several of the players, and show us how the Japanese soldiers in that army were every bit as individualistic as anyone else, despite serving a society that strove to deny the individual.

In many ways, this is a bleak film, served up in a suiting palette of muted greys and browns (the movie almost appears black and white, at times). It is sad, because we know ahead of time what the result will be for the Japanese that we grow to like over the course of the tale, but within it are moments of bravery, heroism and friendship.

I'm glad for movies like this--to show us the humanity of other peoples, times and cultures, and even ones that were, once, our ""enemies."" Clint Eastwood handles this difficult subject with style and respect, and delivers an emotional, enveloping tale of men pushed to their brink.

Wonderful movie. Five stars.",1171756800,20,2248,4.5085995085995085
1602439,4,B00005JPKE,"A well acted movie, also one of the most affecting films I've seen in quite a time.  It left me quite depressed for a while.  In a way it mirrors the times we are living in with our older generation's fatalistic view of the future.

You know the ending - the Americans win the battle with very, very high casualties, but that is overshadowed by the 90 - 95% death rate for the Japanese defenders.

Just as the Japanese leadership on Iwo Jima believed that the only thing they could do was give hell to the invaders and then die, it seems like many of the older generation now feel there is nothing that can be done to change anything and are just waiting for the apocalypse.

But there is hope in the younger generation who believe a united, prosperous and peaceful planet is possible and want to live in it, and are well represented in the film by the young Japanese recruit, Saigo.",1171670400,3,883,4.359756097560975
1602440,5,B00005JPKE,"A simply stunning and moving motion picture. This is not a movie to be enjoyed, but rather one to be experienced. This movie is wonderfully done, and although I do like the movies Clint Eastwood directs, I really do think he has surpassed himself.

""Letters From Iwo Jima"" basically revolves around a ""grunt"" soldier named Saigo, a Japanese soldier who has found himself stationed on the remote island of Iwo Jima. Saigo was a baker in Japan and left behind a pregnant wife, and is a much happier baker than soldier, but is resigned to doing his duty. Through Saigo the audience is to experience the battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective.

I have watched other WWII movies from the Japanese side, but none seemed to truly capture the essence and spirit so fully as this film has. There are no stereotypes here. While there is brutality, the audience is also shown the fact that there was humanity, too. I had expected to see a film that gave a sympathetic view to the Japanese (""hate America, love the enemy""). Instead, I felt I saw a movie that was balanced with good and bad of equal measure - and on both sides. In battle, with those fighting at ground zero, it's hard to say who is right and wrong. This movie expounds on that.

Also, this movie shows clearly how the Japanese war machine worked and how different it was from the Americans. The Americans hoped to return and suicide was never encouraged. The Japanese were told they were not going to return and that suicide was the only honorable ""out"" if one stood in jeopardy of being taken captive.

Even though the film is in Japanese and subtitled in English, it only intensifies the emotions one goes though while watching it. This is an intense, emotional and moving film. Clint Eastwood has truly outdone himself.",1171411200,12,1787,4.62776025236593
1602441,5,B00005JPKE,"Clint Eastwood's ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is the perfect counterpoint to ""Flags of Our Fathers"": the latter, like so many other war movies, focuses solely on the American characters; the former, on the other hand, gives the audience a first hand look into the lives of Japanese soldiers. Rarely do we get to watch a war story from the opposite side. It was quite a refreshing and eye opening experience, especially since it didn't dehumanize a single character. I say this in spite of the fact that many gruesome death and destruction scenes are featured, each side fighting for what they believe to be right. This film depicts war from the ""enemy's"" point of view; it's an experience I recommend to everyone, especially to those who have only seen one-sided commentaries.

As the title suggests, characters frequently write letters to loved ones back on the Japanese mainland. Mostly taking place in 1944, we hear the thoughts and feelings of two soldiers--General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya)--as they write, bringing to the story an emotional depth that's incredibly compelling. Saigo writes to his wife, Hanako (Nae Yuuki), who was pregnant when he was called to duty by the Japanese government. He understandably wants to return home, not only to reunite with his wife, but also to meet his baby daughter for the first time. Such things are repeatedly said in his letters, as are general complaints about their hardships and their grueling daily activities.

While stationed on the island of Iwo Jima, the soldiers prepare for America's inevitable attack. They must do a multitude of tasks: digging trenches, hollowing out caves, arming weapons, etc. But what makes their situation even more difficult is the fairly low morale among the soldiers; despite their service to their country, despite believing that they will die honorably, many seem to know that they're fighting a losing battle; most of their forces have been destroyed, and they're clearly not ready to do battle on the island. It doesn't help that the soldiers are being served tainted water, causing widespread dysentery. After weeks of such conditions, many are willing to surrender the island to American forces. Saigo makes the mistake of suggesting this out loud as their hotheaded captain, Tanida (Takumi Bando), passes by. Apparently, saying such things is unpatriotic and disgraceful; he certainly makes this clear as he beats Saigo with a whip.

Then enters Kuribayashi, a levelheaded man of surprising emotional strength (as shown during scenes of letter writing to his unseen daughter). He notices Tanida's outburst and immediately points out that a good captain uses his brain, not just his whip. Already, this puts him at odds with other military officers, who begin to feel that he's better off behind a desk than commanding an army. They also grow increasingly suspicious of his proposed strategies; he believes that digging a trench along the beach is a waste of time, and that the soldiers should focus their attention on caves underneath the mountains. As the film progresses, feelings against the general rise, especially when they learn that he had spent some time in America.

Indeed, his feelings for the Americans are not as clear-cut as most of the other soldiers'. They were raised to believe that Americans were a weak, inferior people, easily succumbing to emotional impulses when out on the battlefield. By the time combat begins on the island, many Japanese soldiers realize that what they were taught to believe was wrong. There's an especially powerful scene in which the Japanese takes in a wounded American soldier. The superior officer orders that he be treated, not killed. His reasoning is simple: any one of his soldiers would do the same for him. ""An American would never treat a Japanese soldier!"" protests a young officer. ""Have you ever met one?"" is the commander's reply, which was a profound thing to say. The complex relationship between the opposing armies grows deeper after the wounded soldier awakens; he and a Japanese soldier engage in a very cordial conversation.

If only the world's problems could be fixed that easily. Unfortunately, a war is raging, and not everyone is ready to put all differences aside. The Japanese know this all too well: their ammunition is rapidly dwindling, as is their food and water supply; reinforcements will not be sent; soldiers are dying left and right. Some soldiers resort to suicide, believing that they should die honorably as opposed to fighting a losing battle. A very graphic yet important scene shows a number of soldiers with hand grenades, activating them while holding them tightly to their chests. One can't help but question the mentality of anyone willing to die so needlessly, especially since they had the chance (albeit an incredibly slim one) of surviving the war and returning home.

At a certain point in the film, Saigo buries a sack full of unsent letters, none of which would be found until 2005, when a research team discovers them. A shot of the letters falling from the open sack is extremely poignant, with the voices of the soldiers overlapping one another. That scene in particular shows the greatest amount of humanity, and I thank the filmmakers for including it. Much like ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is not a film that glorifies war in any way; rather, it gives a face to the violence and bloodshed that was World War II, a face that we have rarely been given the chance to see. It was both brave and necessary for a war film to show America's ""enemies"" as human beings, with hopes, fears, and loves. For that reason alone, this film needs to be seen.",1171152000,23,5687,4.987355110642782
1602461,3,B00005JPKE,"I really wanted to like ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" more than the three star rating that I gave it here. With a few honorable exceptions, most of the movies that depict the Japanese in World War II (at least the ones not made by Japanese) range from blatantly racist ""ha, ha yankee you die now!"" to ones that show the Japanese as sorts of noble savages.

I give credit to ""Letters"" for showing what typical Japanese soldiers were probably like.  But the movie suffers a great deal from being sloooooow.  I actually heard one member of the audience snoring at one point.  I didn't fall asleep, but I think that if they had shortened it by about half an hour, it would have been much better.

Another gripe is that some of the invasion scenes looked awfully cheesy.  It was pretty obvious that the invasion fleet was nothing but a bunch of CGIs.  I wonder if the film would have had a better effect if it had used newsreel footage instead.

I did think it was interesting that the film interlocked with ""Flags of Our Fathers"" to the degree it did.  I saw some of the same footage of the battle in both movies. The two films have a number of scenes in common with only the point of view shifting.

One final note:  I've noted some people gushing here about how the Japanese soldiers were ""just like us"" and how they only wanted to go home too.  This is true to some degree.  But I would recommend people read books like ""the Rape of Nanking"" (where the Japanese army ran wild in China and killed about 200,000 Chinese civilians), maybe read ""Factories of Death"" (about the Japanese biological warfare unit that did things like vivisect living human beings), watch ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" to see how badly Allied prisoners were treated by the Japanese, or read about the charming practice of abducting Korean women to be ""comfort women"" (i.e. sex slaves for the ""honorable"" Imperial Army).

My point is, yes, there were a lot of ordinary Japanese who only wanted to go home after serving their country.  But the bottom line is that their country was a brutal, expansionist nation that chalked up as many --if not more-- bodies than Nazi Germany. Kuribayashi was one of the most formidable Japanese commanders the US ever faced on land and his soldiers fought bravely and well...but let's remember: it was in the service of an evil cause.",1171065600,13,2332,4.5587529976019185

The new commander on the island, Gen.

We sympathize with characters and understand where they're coming from. Here the Americans are the evil ones, gunning down the Japs when they tried to surrender. Probably the most interesting character in the movie has to be the one delivered by Ken Watanabe. He's an amazing actor. I could watch this guy peel potatoes all day and not be bored.

Those words are actually from the beginning of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flags-of-Our-Fathers/dp/B000O77QDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Flags of Our Fathers""</a>&nbsp;the first of two films from Clint Eastwood dealing with the battle for Iwo Jim during World War II.  That film was about the story behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-photograph-of-the-flag-raising-at-Iwo-Jim/dp/B000EEPJSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the photograph of the flag raising at Iwo Jim</a>&nbsp;and what happened to the men in that famous shot (probably the most reproduced photograph in history).  But the sentiments apply as well to ""Letters from Iwo Jim,"" which tells the story from the perspective of the island's Japanese defenders.  The battle lasted from February 19, 1945 until March 26, 1945 and of the 22,000 Japanese troops entrenched on Iwo Jim, only 1,083 survived, with only 216 of that number being captured.  Allied forces suffered 26,000 casualties, with nearly 7,000 dead in the only large engagement of World War II against the Japanese in which the Allied forces suffered more casualties.  So we watch this 2006 film knowing that the Japanese are going to lose and that none of its characters may be alive by the time the credits roll.

""Letters"" begins with Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arriving on Iwo Jim with orders to defend it to the last man.  Kuribayashi decision to build bunkers and caves rather than trenches on the beaches is viewed with skepticism by his subordinates, but would prove effective in holding the 5 mile by 2 mile island for over a month against an Allied force four times as large despite having neither naval nor air support.  In other words for the Japanese the Battle of Iwo Jim is like Thermopylae or the Alamo, except that losing the battle is not a prelude to winning the war.  The title of the film comes from letters being written home by the Japanese on the island, from the commanding general to the young baker named Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), who had to leave his pregnant wife to become a solider.  It is Saigo who is clearly the character with whom our sympathies lay because he is one of the few who really wants to be alive when the fighting is over.

Both Kuribayshi and Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) challenge the stereotypical view of Japanese officers established in all those old World War II movies.  Kuribayshi studied with American officers in the United States and Nishi won a silver medal in horse jumping at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, so they have a respect for the Americans and an understanding that it is inevitable Japan will lose both this island and the war.  This contrasts sharply with those who yell about death before dishonor, but what stands out most is not the divisive rhetoric but the common human experience.  Nothing in the film humanizes the Japanese soldiers more than the thousand-stitch belts they wear, made by their mothers for them to wear into battle for good luck, and the irony that the most touching letter in the film is one sent to an American soldier by his mother is not lost on us.

To say that ""Letters from Iwo Jim"" is an anti-war film is not particularly insightful because these days you would be hard pressed to find a pro-war film.  As the opening sequences of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00001ZWUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Saving Private Ryan""</a>&nbsp;amply demonstrated, any realistic depiction of a war is going to convince most people they never want to be in one.  But that takes away nothing from those who have gone to war and done their duty.  It is impossible not to see these two films by Eastwood without thinking about the war in Iraq and it is very disquieting to be thinking that blowing yourself up with a grenade makes a suicide bomber look good.  Kuribayahsi had ordered his men to each kill 10 Americans before they die, so how the suicides of these Japanese soldiers conforms to the dictates of honor is incomprehensible.  Then there is the irony of one biggest proponents of honor and suicide being found in a hole just like Saddam Hussein.  In war heroism, cowardice, stupidity, propaganda, death, and so many other things are clearly eternal.

I watched ""Flag of Our Fathers"" again to see to what extent the two films overlap, but there is nothing that stands out (I read that the American with the flame thrower is the only actor to appear in both).  Basically what the two films have in common is the setting of that rock in the Pacific, with its black sand beach (the film's original title was ""Red Sun, Black Sand"").  In ""Letters"" the flag atop Mount Suribachi is a small but significant object seen from the other side of the island by Kuribayashi.  My preference is for ""Letters"" over ""Flag,"" in part because I am less familiar with that side of the story, having seen ""The Outsider,"" the sobering 1961 film starring Tony Curtis as Ira Hayes, but also because almost all of ""Letters"" takes place on Iwo Jima and is more about soldiers fighting and dying.  Of course both films look at what the soldiers on both sides were fighting and dying for, which is why you have to make a point of seeing both films.",1170806400,15,5573,5.118101545253863

1602467,5,B00005JPKE,"I agree with the previous observations about the movie. The development of the characters and the story is excellent. There are no winners in war and the two opposing sides were indeed very much alike.  We have learned to understand this with all our past enemies and this film does a wonderful job of reinforcing that fact.  The beginning and ending are creative and tie the historical event well to the present day.

Another excellent accomplishment of this movie was it's technical merits.  If you have ever studied the Pacific war, the Iwo Jima battle, and the Japanese Army and Navy the following was quite accurate:

1. Scene/battlefield orientation was very accurate.  The initial Japanese headquarters in relation to the beach and Suribachi, the refernece and scenes of Suribachi survivors moving North to join Japanese forces, tunnel systems , etc were all nicely done.  There may not have been an exact sense of time felt by the viewer familiar with the battle but that was okay to me - it was a confusing battle and both sides were under immense stress so I actually enjoyed the aspect of 'losing track' while viewing it.

2. The manner in which the Japanese talked to each other was refreshing - not so much that it was in Japanese, but the subject matter and manner of communication among and between ranks was well done.  I smiled during the conversations and was happy to see a movie filled with accurate dialogue.

3.  The uniforming of the Japanese was perfect.  For years, I have watched movies only to be disappointed at seeing a non-Japanese ammo pouches, an incorrect shoe, field caps with an odd shape, incorrect movie prop helmets, bad insignia, shirts, tunics, holster, belts, and packs that don't resemble Japanese military issue combat gear.  There is more technically correct uniforming in this movie than the majority of public will ever appreciate.  If you want to see what a real Japanese army and navy combat soldier looked like - see this movie!

4. The movie did a good job of exposing the viewer to some of the conflicts that existed between the Japanese army and navy during WWII. Conflicts that often resulted in needless loss of life within their forces resulting from lack of communication,  mis-communication, delayed and/or flawed decisions between and involving the two branches. Also, a hint of the disapproval of Kuribayashi's defense strategy among the senior ranks was presented well - not too excessive, but just enough so that viewers could understand some of the personalities and thinking within the Japanese military on the island and throughout the Pacific war - well done.

5.  Weapons were accurate for the most part also. Particularly the Arisaka rifles, Nambu pistols and Light Machine gun, anti-personnel mines, Type 97 grenades, etc - whether real or props, they were well presented.  There are a few gas bombs, and technical flaws in the air attack and the terrain might be a little questionable in those scenes.  Also, a better job should have been done on the large spigot mortar and some of the Japanese soldiers/extras did not appear to be well trained (as a Japanese soldier during the 40s) on the use of their weapons. More weapons training from period documents and further research from veterans would have solved that.  Overall however, these were minor problems and again, not noticeable by the majority of the viewers..

I've always appreciated Eastwood's work. I only wish I knew Mr. Eastwood and/or had connections to be utilized on this movie and contribute as a technical advisor.  Perhaps, I will have the opportunity to contribute on another Pacific war film project. There's no excuse for sacrificing highly accurate technical details in important movies like this and Mr. Eastwood was obviously aware of this.  This movie accomplished its purpose and will DEFINITELY be a classic.  A wonderful piece of work!!",1170633600,14,3886,4.969088098918084
1602468,5,B00005JPKE,"Letters from Iwo Jima was an after thought of Clint Eastwood after he had read some of the letters written by Japanese soldiers.  Letters was budgeted at 20 million while Flags of Our Fathers had a 90 million budget.  Viewing both films gives us a full picture of a cataclysmic battle that from our perspective of sixty years seems a terrible waste of life.

The film provides perspectives from that on an enlisted man (Saigo, a baker played by Kazunari Ninomiya) and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by Ken Watanabe) through their actions on the island and flashbacks.  So, we learn that General Kuribayashi, a career soldier in the cavalry, lived for a time in the United States where he received as a gift a Colt revolver from his American hosts and that Saigo was drafted after his baking equipment was confiscated to be used in the war effort.  The film begins with the arrival of General Kuribayashi on Iwo Jima and chronicles the hard life of the defenders plagued with dysentery, poor rations and the heat.  Kuribayashi takes up what his officers feel is a poor defense of the island by digging tunnels and not creating trenches on the beach.  The one ally Kuribayashi has among his officers is Baron Nishi, a pragmatic man who had been in the equestrian events in the 1932 Olympics held in Los Angeles and makes his first appearance riding a horse.  There is a feeling of doom over the garrison as little by little they receive mounting bad new: the destruction of what remains of the Japanese fleet, that no additional tanks can be sent and that no reinforcements can be expected.

Kuribayashi maintains a positive front that the battle can be won but everyone in the Japanese garrison can sense immanent defeat. As with Flags of Our Fathers, the battle scenes where filmed showing the ferocity of the fighting and the suicides of many of the Japanese soldiers.  There is a scene where a Japanese commander ignores the order of Kuribayashi to withdraw and orders his men, one of whom is Saigo, to commit suicide, which they do with hand grenades (tying in to a scene from Fathers).  Several of the soldiers are clearly reluctant to kill themselves but only Saigo and another soldier are left alive.

In a film filled with memorable performances two stand out. Ken Watanabe gives a magnificent performance as General Kuribayashi given him a heroic but vulnerable character as he draws sketches of happier past events.  At one point, it appears that the waste of lives almost convinces him that he should surrender but then a broadcast from his home town if Japan by a group of children imploring him to defend them changes his mind.  Kazunari Ninomiya as Saigo is excellent as a reluctant soldier who is doing his duty but would rather surrender that be killed or commit suicide.  Kuribayashi and Saigo are at opposite ends; one heroic and the other pragmatic but the two interact several times in the film and Kuribayashi is instrumental in saving Saigo.

The film is beautifully photographed using mono-chromatic colors that give it a feel of old photographs.  Like Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jim tells an unvarnished story about the horrors of war; the difference with Letters is that the cause is lost and the heroism is tinged with desperation.  I highly recommend seeing both Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima.  Together they present an unforgettable story of a battle that marked the beginning of the end of the war in the Pacific.",1170633600,8,3477,4.774624373956594
1602469,5,B00005JPKE,"It is quite amazing how a director as classically American as Clint Eastwood can make such an emotionally audacious film about the Japanese defense of Iwo Jima during the last year of WWII and manage to do it purely from the Japanese perspective. The idea of showing the adversarial side of the war is not new (1970's ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" comes to mind), but what makes Eastwood's historical epic unique is the intense infusion of humanism that courses through the story and the lack of personal judgment on the suicidal Japanese military strategy at the time. There are neither heroes nor villains on either side. The result is an empathic study of a group of men caught in an inevitably fatalistic situation. Leading the effort is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, an honorable, aristocratic man who has a biding respect for Americans based on his travels there during the late 1920's. With neither air nor naval support forthcoming, Kuribayashi concludes that his troops will need to fight to the death.

The central figure among the soldiers is an obstreperous young private named Saigo, who has left a wife and infant daughter back home. Along with the rest of his troop, he spends weeks excavating tunnels and trenches on the higher grounds of the island. The scope of the incoming U.S. fleet exceeds their worst fears, and the rest of the film focuses on how they face the depletion of ammunitions and rations while realizing defeat and death are at hand. We see brief flashbacks of defining moments in their lives back home, just enough to give their reasons for being there but not to the point where we get fully realized characters. I believe this was an intentional move by the filmmakers to focus on the more immediate emotional responses to sacrificing themselves for a greater good, which comes down to buying more time for the empire to win the overall war.

Similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"", the film is dramatically shot by Tom Stern in desaturated, monochromatic tones that give it a black-and-white, documentary-like feel with the bomb explosions primarily in vivid color. The cast is headed by the only recognizable actor to American audiences, the charismatic Ken Watanabe, who effectively plays Kuribayashi with economic authority. As Saigo, J-Pop star Kazunari Ninomiya really holds the film together through his character's serendipitous circumstances, while effective turns are provided by Tsuyoshi Ihara as the erudite Baron Nishi (the former Olympic equestrian champion); Shido Nakamura as the belligerent and increasingly desperate Lt. Ito; Ryo Kase as the stoically vulnerable Shimizu; and Yuki Matsuzaki as Saigo's smiling comrade Nozaki.

Japanese American writer Iris Yamashita penned the forceful screenplay based on a story by her and Paul Haggis based on a published book of the picture letters Kuribayashi sent to his family and depicted in the film. While the technical aspects of this historical reenactment are superlative, not to mention the fact that the linguistic barriers between the Japanese cast and American crew must have been daunting, this masterful work really shows how the autumnal Eastwood knows like no other director how to convey the gravitas of impending death without sacrificing the propulsive drama and human heart at the core of the story. Be forewarned that some scenes are invariably graphic and that a few of the subtitles have been obscured by the intermittent use of a white background.",1170460800,11,3454,5.120567375886525
1602470,5,B00005JPKE,I went into this movie wondering about how it was like for the other side during the War. This movie is great. It tells and shows the horrors of the war brilliantly. The acting is superb and it deserves the oscars that it will get. I haven't seen Flags but from what I have heard letters is better. I like the film because the focus is on the war. This should be seen by everyone. I just hope that it comes in a two disc set with tons of bonus materials.,1170374400,6,454,4.0
1602510,5,B00005JPKE,"This is a great movie, and a truly original one, although not for the reasons that have been previously offered up by movie critics and fans.

First off, although this movie does portray the Japanese side of the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima, it does not glorify their role in this movie, nor does it ignore the lessons of history served up by this battle.  For the few critics of this movie who say that the Japanese soldiers got what they deserved, that the Japanese started WWII, and that this movie only brings in undeserved sympathy for those soldiers, I say, as an American and a reader of military history, perhaps, but look deeper into what this movie is REALLY saying.

Although American film critics have almost universally hailed this movie as an anti-war movie, this movie is in reality only an anti-bushido movie.  The movie has been extremely popular in Japan, and I cannot but help think that its underlying messages serve only to work against the cause of the resurgent and revisionist right-wing nationalist elements in Japan today.  As the samurai coda of bushido itself is also in resurgence in Japan today, this movie comes none too soon as an antidote.

The movie has two centers - one is on the fictional and very hapless ex-baker Saigo, who has been drafted into the Japanese Army as a common foot soldier; the other is the real-life portrayal of General Kuribayashi, the Japanese commander at Iwo Jima.

The movie makes clear how the rigid military discipline and samurai coda of bushido worked against the Japanese throughout the fight for Iwo Jima.  For although this rigid discipline helped to prevent mass desertions and surrenders, thus enforcing the will of the military elite for these soldiers to fight to the death, it also resulted in stupidly ceremonial suicides when the soldiers were clearly defeated.

The samurai coda of bushido also led to an unwillingness to adapt and learn from previous mistakes.  Kuribayashi, who had studied in America, and had studied previous Japanese island defeats against the Americans, actually had to fight his own fellow commanders to implement his defensive tactic of building caves and fortresses inland.  Brief mention is made in this movie of how he was urged to not give up the beach entirely -  and so the Japanese did put in some pillboxes overlooking the beach landing sites.  The only result was that three months of hard work building the beach defenses would all be blown away in the first few hours of the preliminary American naval bombardment.

Above all else, the portrayal of Saigo, and of the failed Kempetai (Japanese secret police) soldier Shimizu show how brutal the Japanese military system was at the time to its own people.  Both suffer harshly from the military system - Saigo's bakery is regularly looted by the Kempetai and then finally ruined by the war, and his pregnant wife is left in tears when he is drafted into the war (""none of the men ever return"", she cries).  Saigo's clumsy efforts at soldiering and general cynicism about the course of the war lead to beatings and near-death episodes at the hands of his officers.  In a flashback during the movie, Shimizu's failure to brutalize a Japanese family by killing their pet dog at his commander's order is met with a beating from his superior (Japanese commanders were authorized to physically beat their soldiers and underlings) and ejection from the Kempetai.

Most moving of all, the mass suicide with grenades, after Mount Suribachi had been taken by the Americans, is portrayed as a direct disobeyal of an order from General Kuribayashi to retreat, regroup, and  fight again.  The group suicide is demanded by one of the most fanatically bushido-driven of the officers.  What a stupid man and stupid concept!  To kill yourself when you can still fight.

The one false note in the whole movie was the scene where the character of Lieutenant Colonel Baron Takeichi Nishi talks to a captured American soldier.  That this ever happened is highly dubious (I mean, this American soldier was carrying a flamethrower when he was shot - such soldiers were universally targeted for instant death whenever possible).  It seems to only have been thrown in for two reasons - to balance out an earlier scene where a captured American soldier was beaten and bayoneted to death, and as an opportunity for the Nishi character to engage in some exposition about himself.  OK, Baron Nishi was a very colorful historical character, winner of the Gold Medal in the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics in Equestrian show jumping and friend to many Hollywood stars.  But this whole scene just rang false, and people in the theater audience snickered when the Nishi character started speaking Engrish.

All in all, this is a truly original work, exploring themes of the Japanese side of WWII that have never been explored before, either by Americans or the Japanese themselves.

Japanese works regarding WWII have invariably portrayed the Japanese characters, whether civilian (""Grave of the Fireflies"") or military (the recent movie ""Otoko-tachi no Yamato"" and the book ""Requiem for Battleship Yamato"", both about the last suicidal mission of the battleship) as tragic but heroic victims of overwhelming American might, and about the biggest Deep Thought that one ever gets out of these Japanese works has been some sort of a vague admission that  ""all war is bad""; there is never any exploration of the possibility that something in Japanese society itself at that time might have been terribly, stupidly evil.

Yes, it was the brutal military rulers of Japan who stupidly threw the Japanese people into a war that they could not hope to win, and then stupidly demanded mass suicide when their decisions failed.  Bushido was the underlying principle that led to all of that.  And ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is the first movie ever to bring out these concepts, while showing at the same time its greatest respect for the Japanese soldiers forced to endure under the harsh rule of that military elite.",1170028800,198,6026,4.917077986179664
1602511,5,B00005JPKE,"Well.  Don't go into this movie expecting to be entertained, its more of an experience than anything else.  Of course Letters From Iwo Jima is about the battle of Iwo Jima told from the Japanese perspective with English Subtitles.  I didn't see Flags of Our Fathers so I can't compare the two.

The acting is very good, Ken Watanabe is as good as ever and the guy that plays ""Shago"" was great.  The direction is good, I was hoping for more battle scenes on Iwo Jima but I heard Flags has more fighting.  This movie moves slowly at first but once we come(Americans) it all pretty much goes to hell for everyone.

I loved the sepia toned, drained look to the movie and the ending is great in my opinion.  The only part where this movie drags is in the beginning, but thats a minor complaint.  It also has one of the most disheartening scenes I've ever scene.  I guess I gotta put up the big SPOILER! warning to talk about it, so SPOILERS!

Its the scene where the roomful of Japanese soldiers blow themselves up with there own gren@des.  Now that we are talking about v! olence lets talk about how bad it is in this movie.  Honestly, its not that bad.  Yes, there are some graphic scenes, but if your kid has seen GLADIATOR OR Kingdom of Heaven or another war movie he/she should see this.

Overall this is a heart wrenching, great look at how bad war is.  And that no matter what side you are on there are good and bad people.  Probably most importantly it says that in war there are no winners, only losers...",1169942400,8,1509,4.332142857142857

I have talked to many a WWII vets about this film, and NONE admires or is sad about the suffering of the Japanese soldier in this film.  They like me, are glad they rot entombed forever in caves on Iwo Jima or died above ground on that soil. Of course the Japanese soldier wrote sorrowful, compelling, sad good byes to their families. So does a serial killer in their trials! Their tears, the I am sorry for the pain I caused they will say. But only because they were caught and now about to be punished forever... Otherwise they would have continued their rampage!! Had the Japanes landed on USA soil and successful invaded the USA,we would have been tortured, slaughtered, killed and enslaved by these horrible humans. I feel no sorrow for these soldiers, their leaders or families.. Ok we can blame their teaching from cradle to grave.

1602514,5,B00005JPKE,"There have been more movies about World War II than any other subject I can think of. Seriously, I think that if it weren't for Shakespear, WWII would be the favorite topic in Hollywood to make a film about. These movies are about a popular topic, feature lots of violence, and usually walk away with a truckload of Oscars. ""Letter From Iwo Jima"" is one of these movies but with one very crucial twist: It takes place from the point of view of the Japanese army. It's a few days before the famous battle at Iwo Jima and the Japanese army, led by General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), are tasted with the unfavorable task of having to defend Iwo Jima from the American's. They know the American's will attempt to take over the island, but no one wants to fight them.

After all the Japanese are outnumbered, have weapons that pale to America's technology, and no reinforcements are coming. This is a battle to the death. If they die, they die with honor. The soldiers dig trenches and prepare for the upcoming battle, all while they write letters to their loved ones, who many know they most likely will never see again. The character we follow the most is Saigo, who was a humble baker who was forced into joining the army while he left his wife, Hanako, alone to give birth to their child. When he digs a trench, he writes to his wife ""I feel like I am digging my own grave."" The letters prove to be the most emotionally gripping scenes in the movie, as the character narrate the letters they are writing. The letters explain their feelings, thoughts, and regrets in life.

Since the movie takes place from the Japanese point of view, you'd expect the movie to be very slanted and biased towards American's. This could not be farther from the truth. While a couple of American's are shown as brutes, all the soldiers in this movie are seen as young men who are simply doing their duty. After one American soldier gets shot by a Japanese general, the general has his wounds treated and forms a bond with the American, who is named Sam. General Kuribayashi serves his country with honor, but having been deemed a friend of the American's (with a custom made pistol to boot), Kuribayashi is conflicted about having to kill his friends. When the battle actually starts it's everything you expect it to be: Bloody, violent, and so fast paced it's hard to see what's going on sometimes.

But the movie also takes time to share quiet moments with the Japanese soldiers, including one soldier who gains respect for the American's after he has had to kill some. Seeing 2006's ""other"" Iwo Jima movie, ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" helped me with my enjoyment of this movie greatly. Keep in mind, I didn't particularly like ""Flags of Our Fathers"" very much (I gave it two and a half stars). I thought it was too long, there was too much focus on the battle of Iwo Jima (the story about the flag propaganda was far more interesting), and I felt that the movie just didn't have the sort of ""heart"" that's required to make a great war film. This movie does have the heart that ""Flags of Our Fathers"" lacked, and in a couple of pivotal scenes, ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" become one whole film with one uniting message. Watching both films heighten my appreciation not only for this film, but for ""Flags of Our Fathers.""

As I watched this film I couldn't help but find myself respecting the Japanese soldiers who fought at Iwo Jima. Oh sure, I can't say I was rooting for them. They were on Hitler's side during this battle, and they certainly killed many of my fellow American's during this time period. But they had honor, bravery, and they were doing exactly what we were doing, which was serving their country. I may not ever understand the whole suicide thing they did when things went wrong, but I commend that they were brave soldiers in this war. I hope people don't skip this film just because the thought of reading subtitles scare them. This is a stupid reason to not see a movie, and it's particularly a stupid reason not to see this film. ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" is one of the best films of the year. In fact, it's one of the few perfect films I've ever seen.

1602515,5,B00005JPKE,"The second half of Clint Eastwood's two-film look at the Battle of Iwo Jima (Following last October's ""Flags of our Fathers,""), ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is an emotional, fascinating look at the battle from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers. In this film, Eastwood shows the Japanese mentality during the war, but also shows that some were uncomfortable with it. For me, it shows that, when you strip all politics and ideologies away from war, all true soldiers fight for the same reasons: for their country and those they love.

The movie follows the actions of two key players. Oscar-nominee Ken Watanabe (""The Last Samurai"") gives a great performance as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the man given the responsibility of commanding the garrison on the island of Iwo Jima. Here, we see a man who knows that fighting against the United States is a no-win situation, but will still defend the island for his country. Kazunari Ninomiya gives a fine performance as Saigo, one of the common soldiers in the Japanese army. His character is complex: one who didn't want to fight, but was conscripted to join the army, leaving his wife and child behind, and Ninomiya pulls of the part splendidly. The rest of the cast give great performances as well.

While the film does move a bit slow at times, the great performances, fine storytelling, and exciting battle sequences more than make up for the film's slower passages. Overall, I say that ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is a better film than ""Flags of our Fathers,"" giving us a look at those we fought against in a kind, somber manner. I recommend this film to both historians and war-film afficinados.

Grade: A-",1169596800,9,1657,4.868794326241135
1602516,4,B00005JPKE,"This is a well-made, honorable movie that somehow didn't quite click on an emotional level for me.  I'm an admirer of Eastwood's understated directing style, where he let's the actors do some acting without having to add frantic editing and other tricks.  He clearly believes that well-written characters, well-played by well-cast performers is about 80% of the trick to directing a good film...and he's mostly correct.  MILLION DOLLAR BABY, MYSTIC RIVER & UNFORGIVEN are but a few examples of his ""less is more"" style.  They are longish movies that give the viewer time to get to know the characters...yet they never really drag either.

LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is extremely well-crafted, and is well-acted by a group of actors largely unknown to American audiences (exception being Ken Watanabee, whom we all got to know for his excellent work in THE LAST SAMURAI).  The young men who portray the doomed troops abandoned by Japan to defend the rocky island of Iwo Jima are all very good, and it takes almost no time at all to get used to reading the subtitles.

Eastwood also does a good job of evoking the landscape of the island.  I've never been, so I don't know if it's accurate, but my impression after seeing the film is that this rock was a pretty uninteresting place.  Lots of desert landscapes, with volcanic  hills and very dusty beaches (there are some evocative scenes of soldiers going up the dunes near the ocean, kicking up so much dust that they can barely be seen).  It hardly looks like a  place worth shedding so much blood on.

There are some powerful scenes.  The most horrific involves a scene of mass-suicide.  A squad of troops believes they have been ordered to kill themselves because they have failed to defend Mt. Suribachi from the Americans.  Some of the soldiers know that their general has ordered them to retreat to fight another day...but most refuse to credit this order and they begin to kill themselves one by one with hand grenades clutched to their bodies.  It's brutal and amazing.  You shake your head and wonder at the mindset that could lead to this.  And you also cringe for the young men who clearly are only doing what they feel their society wants them to do...none does it with anything but sadness.  It's a gory mess, and it will rattle the toughest moviegoer.

Another good scene features the Japanese meeting a wounded American soldier.  The frightened American meets a Japanese officer who speaks English and has good things to say about America.  The soldier draws touching comfort from this gentle contact, and after he dies, the officer reads to his men a letter the young American had from his mother.  The soldiers are all greatly moved by this simple letter...it puts a human face on the enemy.

But a lot of the film feels generic in its scenes.  It's hard to get any sense of the strategy being employed or of how much time is passing.  I have NO idea from watching the film how much time passes from when the Americans land to when the Japanese were completely defeated.  It feels like it could be two days or two weeks or even more.  To me, this is a mistake...a context that is lacking.  The film simply got a little repetitive.  Groups of outnumbered Japanese soldiers running from one spot to another, most of them being mowed down by American firepower on the way.  To me, rather than making me feel the random chaos of battle, I just felt like I was being left to fill in the blanks of what was going on for myself.

Part of the problem is that this style of rapid-fire, chaotic ""war action"" was done so well with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that it has frankly lost much of its power to stun.  Eastwood isn't quite the action-engineer that Spielberg is, so IWO JIMA suffers some in comparison.  RYAN did a darn fine job of showing me the carnage, randomness, brutality, gore, etc., etc. of men in battle.  That movie shook me to the core.  But sense that time, war movies that have followed cannot quite get the same feelings from me by showing similar (but inferior) scenes.  This is not to say that war movies have no power to stun anymore...far from it.  But these particular types of action scenes don't quite cut it anymore.  They feel derivative now.

The best parts of IWO JIMA are the quieter times, when the men (of high rank and low) consider their impending deaths, and we feel their sense of loss.  The knowledge of all the things they won't be going home to.  Their desire to draw meaning from the sacrifices they know they are about to make.

The movie is worth seeing, absolutely.  It is 140 minutes long, but the length was no issue for me.  I think I simply wasn't moved as much as the hype had led me to believe I would be.  I suggest going to see it without any preconceived ideas, if you can, and you will find it a unique glimpse at World War II, and at the effects of combat on those on the front lines.  Eastwood has done another stellar job on a film whose scale just occasionally exceeds his grasp.

(On the subject of ""revisionist"" history...I too am a bit uncomfortable about the depiction of the Japanese as being on the same moral level as the Americans.  It is well-documented [Bataan Death March, anyone] that the Japanese commited many atrocities on a large scale level.  My own father-in-law often spoke of arriving at POW camps after they had been abandoned by the Japanese guards only to find all the detainees had been slaughtered.  Someone needs to make a modern day movie version of James Clavell's KING RAT to show some of that horror.)",1169424000,3,5535,4.590214067278287
1602517,5,B00005JPKE,"I think that this film is a great triumph for Mr. Eastwood. It is a beautiful and moving film which shows the brutality of war on many levels. It is possibly one of the best war movies ever made, and also incredibly different from any other war movie. You can not help but be moved by the plight of the men - they are facing inevitable defeat. Whether or not this defeat is warranted is never addressed here. The movie does not touch into Japanese atrocities that started the war, but it does give a clear glimpse of the military imperialism that sent these men to inevitable death or imprisonment.

Ken Watanabe is superb in his role as Lieutenant General Kuribayashi. One of the most disturbing and moving scenes was to hear their last radio transmission from Tokyo headquarters broadcasting a song sung by children from Kuribayashi's home town. The words of the song are disturbing as the young children's voices plead with the men to die bravely for their country. It is in moments like this that you see the psychological brainwashing that the Japanese military elite had subjected their military to.

I think it is important to remember that Letters from Iwo Jima is a companion piece to Flags of our Fathers. One should not watch Letters without seeing Flags. Any complaints about revisionism lack any merit when these two films are seen more as a whole. No one is trying to rewrite history and state that what the Japanese government did wasn't wrong. But that is not the main thrust of these films. It is about the greater meaning about the morality of war and of soldiers sent out to fight for an idealogy they may or may not believe in. THat at least is what we see in Letters from Iwo Jima, through the eyes of a baker who never wanted to go to war and seeks only to get back to his wife and newborn daughter and the fears of a young dishonored military policemen who with a change of heart realizes there is no honor in death and does not want to die. These moments humanize the Japanese soldiers as Flags did for the American GIs. And that, I believe, is Mr. Eastwood's greatest directorial achievement since Unforgiven.",1169337600,3,2134,4.5546875
1602518,5,B00005JPKE,"""Letters From Iwo Jima,"" Clint Eastwood's companion piece to ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" released earlier in the year, is easily the best movie of the year ('06). I think ""Letters"" edges ""Flags"" as the better movie, simply because, unlike ""Flags"" this film, from the Japanese prospective, does not focus on the aftermath of the soldiers who fought in the war, but rather the war itself. Not that ""Flags"" is flawed for its approach, far from it - it is interesting, powerful, and mostly original in that it explores its subject on a political level - but ""Letters"" proves that a war movie is most effective and powerful when if focuses on the war - and those involved in it - itself.

""Flags,"" if you recall, was more about the three soldiers who raised the American flag on the Japan's island of Iwo Jima during WWII after our country's victory there, and their return home touted as heroes only to become pawns in our government's agenda to sell war bonds in order to finance further action in the war. I found that film very interesting from the standpoint that I never knew there was such a push to sell these bonds because our country was running out of money to finance the war; and I loved Eastwood's expert direction of the battle sequences (the best in maybe any war movie I have ever seen - and that's a big list). But the film felt like it could have been shorter by 20 minutes and you also kind of saw where it was going early on.

""Letters,"" by contrast, is a far more effective study of the war and the human beings involved in it. The story, constructed around letters unearthered from destroyed Japanese bunkers on Iwo Jima (which were also the basis for novel upon which this film is based), is a far-more in-your-face allegory for the traumas of war. The film makes the point that it makes no difference if you are Japanese or American, we are all the same and all have mothers and families that do not want to see us die just because our country deems the cause worthy.

The movie takes a half hour or so to get going - introducing us to the few soldiers we will follow through the battle - but after that the film takes off in the way ""Flags"" seemed like it might, but only ultimately did in brief flashbacks. In ""Letters"" the battle is the story and the character studies and background are the flashbacks. In ""Letters"" we see why the American soldiers in ""Flags"" entered Japanese bunkers only to find soldiers who had exploded themselves with hand grenades, and why, even though the Japanese had the advantage of cover and surprise, the Americans were still able to overcome them. Out-gunned, under-manned and lacking in supplies, troops, and ammo, the Japanese fought a war they knew they could not win, but did so because they were taught it was the honorable thing to do. There is no mention of Pearl Harbor or what got Japan, and us for that matter, involved in WWII, but you can't help but think that none of this would have been necessary had they not made the mistake of attacking that navel base in Hawaii. The Japanese troops don't necessarily agree with what their empire did, but they know they have no choice but to defend it. To die doing so is considered honorable. Eastwood presents the parallels between those troops and those ideals and our own as a heartbreaking and unfortunate product of cultural beliefs and perspectives.

Some have said this film (and ""Flags"") is slow and doesn't tell us anything we don't already know about this war - or war itself.  These viewers are missing these film's two major most points and assets - precisely what makes them so great and original.  First, neither film was ever intended or promised to be a big, bloody war action flick.  They are not really about the war.  They are about men and the effects of war, both during and after, both on them and their loved-ones (although, how many of us did know about the political games played with soldiers in the name of selling war bonds?).  Both films have those grandiose war sequences to be sure (and they are some of the best captured on celluloid - especially in ""Flags""), but these movies are about the soldiers themselves.  Second, Eastwood is not a ""slow"" director.  He is a minimalist and simplistic director who understands that to create mood and atmosphere is far more important to a film's impact that than bombastic action sequences.  In all of his movies from ""Unforgiven,"" to ""Mystic River,"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" to these epics, Eastwood crafts a stark mood from stark settings and stark characters.  The sense that something devastating is going to happen gradually tightens around the viewer like a noose.  When violence does occur it is shocking, disheartening, and meaningful, and its impact is felt ten times more than watching soldier after soldier get shot on a battlefield. Want proof?  Just look at this film's last shot. It is of simply a beach and the sound of the waves gently rolling over the sand.  This one, simple image puts a lump in the viewer's throat because they have just seen all the chaos and devastation that occurred there.  And for what?  All is silent now.  All the individual names and deeds are forgotten.  Clint says all that with one simple, quiet image.

Eastwood's films are not about the violence itself, but the effects of it.  And as such, all the films mentioned, have been fascinating and emotionally charged character studies.  In that respect, ""Letters"" may be his finest masterpiece. Clint has emerged as the best director of this current generation.  That says something considering the guy's career has spanned several generations.

But it is true, ""Letters"" won't play well to most of today's ADD-afflicted movie-goers, and that's a shame considering with its length and subtitles the film will already be a tough sell even to it's intended audience.  However, it is a far better movie than say, ""Dreamgirls"" and other fine, but overrated films this year that seem destined to eclipse this movie come Oscar time. But if there is any justice, ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" will be Eastwood's next Oscar winner. At the very least, it deserves to be seen. I saw it with three other people and it sparked an hour long conversation about life, war, and filmmaking.

If that isn't a sign of a great movie, I don't know what is.",1169337600,6,6299,4.661552346570397
1602519,4,B00005JPKE,"Why did I expect more from an Eastwood movie?  The reviews were so profound, we had to go!  Quite frankly, I expected something thought provoking and reflective - but gentle in retrospect.  But this is a WAR film and is bloody and gory and does quite effectively spotlight that these people were real and the war is so unimaginably awful (though Eastwood seems to imagine the disease, the chaos pretty well).  Know that it is almost entirely in Japanese, in case you are sub-title phobic.  It is one of those films everyone should probably see, but not a popcorn stuffing bit of entertainment and so sepia tinted it is almost black and white.  The audience was definitely an older crowd, likely a lot of veterans.  And the film was just a little too long (mad dash for The Ladies!).  And I LOVED the letter from Oklahoma Mom, ""always do what is right, because it is right.""  Amen.",1169251200,,880,4.554140127388535

7942376,5,B00005JPKE,"This second film on the battle of Iwo Jima is from the point of view of the Japanese and based on a collection of letters the Japanese soldiers received or wrote during the battle, letters that were never dispatched or were never distributed, and were incidentally saved by probably the sole survivor of the battle, a survivor who only survived due to a set of circumstances that saved his life three times during the whole battle. This Japanese soldier put the letters in a leather bag and buried them in one of the caves used by the commander of the Japanese troops. The bag of letters was found when some Japanese workers started working recently on the island to turn it into some kind of memorial.

The film shows with a lot of crude truthfulness the life of these soldiers  and officers  who knew from the very start that they were all going to die on this island for no reason whatsoever but for the Emperor and the Empire, even though this Emperor and this Empire were doomed to get to their dead end of a final destination. The life of the soldiers is brutal and the officers are divided. A new commander arrives for the battle and some flashbacks show how attached to the USA he was and yet he will be wounded and will die, by his own hand with a Colt that had been presented to him by some American important people in some kind of celebration in the USA before the war. An allusion to the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic Games is quite pregnant in this context.

This commander could be humane in this context, both for his troops and for the one and only prisoner he made. Apart from this one he provided with some medical and communicational comfort while he was dying, no other prisoner was made and two Japanese prisoners were made on the American side and the two GIs who were supposed to look after them took the decision to kill them, one GI by shooting the two bullets and the other GI as an accessory to this crime.

This battle was a battle without any prisoners, except the simple soldier who had been saved from a vicious caning at the beginning, then from a sectarian beheading from some fundamentalist patriotic officer, and finally from the final assault by the commanding officer of the battle. This soldier witnessed the final suicide of this commanding officer who was severely wounded and committed suicide with the Colt he was presented as a gift long before the war, hence dying from an American bullet. The surviving Japanese soldier buried his commanding officer so that he would not be taken away from this Japanese land, just before being made prisoner. Nothing is said about his future.

The film also shows, particularly with the letters the soldiers are writing to their families that are quoted all along the drastic horror they have to live through. They are also divided between very few wanting to surrender, many being tired and bored with the war but ready to go on to the final end, and a certain proportion, particularly among officers, ready to consider dying in such a butchery is an honor, a heroic honor. Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg do not go beyond and hardly show real Japanese society, except in some flashbacks about before the war, about before being drafted into the war, or even a few about the real survival conditions of the wives and children left behind.

War is a drastic event and there is no one side in such an event that is clean. Since 1945 and this second world war, all wars were lost by the western powers who waged them, be it Great Britain, the USA, France, and even the USSR as an eastern power. Wars are numerous but always limited in scope and even terrorism is limited and would be a lot more limited if the west, globally or partially, had not provoked the Muslim world with the war in Afghanistan and then the war in Iraq and then the war in Syria, in other words a never-ending war in the Middle East started in 2001 and still going on with the USA trying to play their own and singlehanded game as if they were God Almighty. And of course they are unable to concede a defeat and after Obama had tried to step back and out of the muddy quicksands, the USA is back on the war track and the tomahawks they brandish are missiles.

The two films, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, are a real manifesto to our most humane mental reality to make us understand there is no glory in war, no heroism in war, no future in war, and yet some have difficulties, and at times many difficulties to understand there must be an end in everything. It is amazing how people who have never had a war in their own street and in their backyards are unable to see the horror of such events and are ready to pay for such brutal and cruel selfish violence that achieve so little positive results, including pay for substitutes when they are drafted into such a war.
