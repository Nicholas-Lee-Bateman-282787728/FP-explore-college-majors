5445502,5,B00AKHE40U,"I was a little unsure when we ordered this movie. I just wasn't sure if it would really be something my two and a half year old would pay attention to. It looked like very beautiful animation, and sometimes, honestly, I think she just gets bored if it isn't bright and ""super animated"" if you know what I mean. WOW was this mama wrong. We received this movie in the mail right before heading out on a car trip that ended up being about two hours- and we watched this movie the WHOLE time. So, about 2.5 times total I guess? She was immediately captured by the fantastic animation, and the well-crafted story. She liked pointing out all the animals, and pointing out when the witch dropped her want ""oh no! ""and repeating the recognizable ""is there room on the broom for me"" phrase- which was adorable. She also was very interested in the insert with all the rest of the books by the author Julia Donaldson- and asked if we could ""get all of them"". We went to the library the next day and she was very happy to find ALL of the books there on the shelf waiting for her. Not only is this a great movie- but a great way to make reading more fun too!",1376438400,23,1145,4.232876712328767
5445503,5,B00AKHE40U,"My children loved this! My oldest daughter is 10, so she wasn't very interested in it, but my other children (8, 6, and 4) all loved it. My youngest son's favorite was the cat because he loves cats. When my oldest child was 3 or 4, she probably would have been scared of the dragon, but her brothers weren't! I loved how the only dialog in the movie is the narration of the book. What a wonderful way to bring a great book to life. I love the lesson of friendship and working together.",1376352000,2,485,4.170212765957447
5445504,4,B00AKHE40U,"I am not a big fan of witches and what they represent but I like to keep an open mind so I was willing to give the Room on the Broom a shot. Considering it's immediate popularity, I knew it couldn't be filled with evil as I imagine most witch stories to be.

I read through the book alone at first and really enjoyed the witty rhymes and cute, unique story. The witch is actually the friendly sort and when she gets aid from friends, she returns their kindness. It is not at all what I would expect from a witch story and when I realized the story was harmless, I read it to my kids.

They both loved the story and immediately wanted to watch the DVD. The DVD is basically the story come to life. The only words are those from the book. I really liked this because the kids really had to pay attention and see all that happened between the dialogue. Actions really do speak louder than words.

The only concern I'd have for younger children is the dragon is a little bit frightening. My four year old got a little scared when he showed up but when I asked if she wanted me to turn it off she said no. And then when it was over she asked to watch it again and said it wasn't that scary now that she'd seen the whole thing.

Room on the Broom is adorable and quirky and truly unique. It's message of helping others and friendship is priceless.",1376092800,3,1341,4.1461538461538465
5445505,5,B00AKHE40U,"My family and I love reading the book and watching the DVD of ""The Gruffalo"" so we were excited when the DVD ""Room on the Broom"" which is also by Julia Donaldson was released. In the movie, Room on the Broom, a witch and her cat take a journey on the witches broom. On their ride they continuously lose items which are found by other animals. These animals join the witch and cat on their trip.  The cat learns a few lessons on kindness and cooperation.  My kids loved that the squirrel and snake from The Gruffalo make an appearance at the beginning of the movie. Adorable movie!",1375920000,6,580,4.361111111111111
5445506,5,B00AKHE40U,"My family has been a fan of this book for some time and it definitely is one that I know that my children have asked me to read many times in the past. So you can guess that we were very excited to see that this great story was now being released as a video too. In watching this movie as a family I have to say that they have done a great job at capturing the wonderful feel of the book itself and added on some additional mannerisms about each of the characters that you cannot specifically see in the book which made the characters deeper with a longer back story.

I also have to say that we enjoyed also watching the bonus features. This was the first time that we have been introduced to the author and gave us a more intimate knowledge to why the book was made in the way it was.

All-in-all this movie does a great job at capturing all aspects of the book itself and whether you have read the book or not you too will like this as well.

5445507,5,B00AKHE40U,"It was wonderful!  My children (3 & 5yrs) were already very familiar with the book.  This follows the text with no additional text added but the film is still about 25 minutes long.  The animation alone adds so much to the story.  You learn more about the characters, etc.  It is very funny and very sweet....just lovely.  I teach 3rd grade and my students loved it also!",1373414400,14,371,4.462686567164179
5445508,5,B00AKHE40U,"I saw this while on holiday in Cardiff around Christmas 2012, and I must say I wept so freely and happily.  The BBC did a beautiful adaptation of this lovely little children's book.  This is a timeless new classic that decrees inclusion for all--there is indeed ""room on the broom"" for us all.

Have the book myself and have given copies, all of which are adored by critics across many different ages.  Can't wait for this little DVD to make it here across the pond.",1371427200,11,466,4.447058823529412

The narrator is perfect and the characters are given added personality traits that enhance the story.  Even the witch-eating dragon is adorable.  There is great subtle humor that adults will enjoy while watching this with their children.  I loved reading this book to my grandchildren and loved the video even more.

5445515,5,B00AKHE40U,"My husband and I stumbled across this cute movie last night and can not recommend it enough. It has an endearing story about sharing, friendship and loyalty. The animation is really well done. It also has a nice mix of dialogue/narration and silence that allow you to talk to your child about whats happening in the movie (e.g., how do you think so-and-so feels right now? what do you think will happen next?) to make it interactive if you want.

The runtime of 30 minutes is just right for the toddler/preschool set. My 2.5 year old was engrossed the whole time, but ready to do something else by the end.",1516924800,,606,4.509090909090909

5445531,5,B00AKHE40U,"Great adaptation of the book. The animation is really well done, the characters are computer generated but textured to look like they are made of clay, sort of like old school ""Claymation"" but perfect.

Plus, it has one of those overrides so you can't just hit your menu button and jump right to the movie menu--you have to sit through all the crap. Our son loves, loves, loves Room on the Broom, though, and since Amazon deleted it from its Prime (streaming) listings, DVD it is.

To give you more of an idea how many ads are included, the box advertises an hour of playtime. The actual Room on the Broom feature is less than 30 mins for runtime. Ugh.",1494374400,,576,4.236363636363636

It is really adorable and my husband and I enjoy watching it too.

5445943,5,B00AKHE40U,"This film is funny and has great animation. I like that they quote directly from one of my favorite  books, Room on the Broom, by Julia Donaldson. I also like how the words all rhyme.

Room on the Broom is about a witch and her cat who go on a trip and the witch drops something from her broom. She flies down to get it but a wild animal finds it. When they give it back, they ask if they can come with her. Meanwhile, a scary monster chases them but they are unaware. This happens three times and soon there are so many creatures on the broom that it becomes too heavy.

I like the animation because of its detail. The expressions of the characters are very amusing and made me laugh. I also enjoyed the music because it sets the mood for each scene. My favorite part of the film is when the monster captures the witch and it seems like shes doomed. I like this part because it is a twist on the rest of the film. This part is also the scariest part for younger kids so, be forewarned. I like this scene because it is action packed and suspenseful.

The stellar cast includes Simon Pegg as the narrator. Gillian Anderson does the witchs voice. The four animals are played by Rob Brydon, Martin Clunes, Sally Hawkins and David Walliams.

The moral of this film is to be kind and make friends and it talks about the importance of friendship. If parents have their children read the book along with the narrator, it becomes a more educational experience.

Room on the Broom is a great film. I give it four and a half out of five stars because it is a fun film for younger children. I recommend it for ages 2 to 8 and I think parents will enjoy watching it with their younger kids.

5445958,5,B00AKHE40U,"What a fantastic adaptation of the children's Halloween book.  This has been one of my daughter's and mine's favorite Halloween books since we first discovered it several years ago.  The book is great, but this animated story is absolutely wonderful.  The animation is incredible, especially in glorious HD.  But here is what we really loved about it:  It follows the exact same dialog from the book, word for word, but gives you soooo much more of the story that you do not see in the book.  It takes 5 minutes to read the book (slowly and looking at all of the pictures) but this animated feature is almost 30 minutes long.  So in between the dialog from the book, there are scenes with no dialogue, but that tell so much of the story that we did not even know existed.  This is now our absolute favorite Halloween special, and will be watched for many years to come!",1477526400,,869,4.490445859872612

First discovered it as a book and read it to my baby grandson, who at two months actually liked it.  Then his parents discovered there was a movie.  This is by far my grandson's favorite movie.  He could be crying at top lung, but would stop immediately if you turned on ""Room On The Broom"". He's now 8 months old.  His mom says she can repeat the story verbatim from memory.  The animation is beautifully detailed, but yet has a simple and focused presentation so that very young children can follow it.  The story is fun and uncomplicated - again good for the very young child.  The characters are wonderful with amusing personalities.

We haven't read the book but saw the DVD and it was very cute, adventurous, and taught a good lesson of being kind to others. I have to say my little one was a little put off on the scenes with the dragon, so perhaps caution when showing this movie to the little ones.

At the very beginning, before the actual story began, there must have been a scratch on  the disc because the video would freeze, and we had to fast forward to get to the main story. Not really a problem because it is now being used in a kid DVD player and will probably be handled a little roughly anyway. I'm sure if I had returned it, Amazon would have replaced it, but it didn't seem worth the effort since the kids wanted to see it immediately.",1466985600,,491,4.336956521739131

5446303,5,B00AKHE40U,this is one of our favourite stories :-)  We think it's a little silly that some words have been changed from the original version to suit the american public (because I don't think it was necessary) but we love both versions anyway.  We love the CD that comes with it (ours did anyway) and the little movie they made is also brilliant.  I confess that I am still guilty to listening to it in the car even when no one else is with me LOL...all in all everyone in our house still loves this as much today as they did 7 years ago when we first got it...even my 10 year old :-),1465084800,,574,4.061946902654867

There is a place for all those things, but it does not relax me to watch crazy car chases damaging beautiful cars, and I don't need violence thrust into my living room, and I am not a voyeur of other people's sexual antics.  I need to feel joy and peace and this movie fills me with that!

The animation is peaceful and zen like in its simplicity, with few and meaningful sounds and movements.  This was extremely enjoyable.  I could focus on each character and the little but poignant sounds and facial movements they made, like clay animation, which implied a whole lot more.  Each character tickled your heart!

The story was simple yet as enduring as an Aesop's Fable.  A simple plot that has a villain and heroes which appeals to all of us child or adult.  A damsel in distress saved by her friends, not a Prince Charming, that appeals to my independent feminist side very much.  A parable where diverse characters that would normally be enemies in the wild, unite to defeat a common foe, and save their friend.  This is the moral tone of the movie, so it teaches children an important truth, and reminds adults better than a church visit, that unity is strength.

This is a short lyrical film that is as refreshing as a Mint Julep on a hot Southern day.  Don't we al need a little magic in our lives?",1454112000,,1481,4.49438202247191

8553086,5,B00AKHE40U,"What a great pre-school show! It's just slightly scary (my toddler can get a little nervous about the dragon), but for the most part, it's just plain fun! It feels like it was lovingly created, with cute details you notice on the second (or third, or forth...) viewing. The characters each have their own personality, and interact in amusing ways. The witch is sweet and kind and no one gets their feelings hurt or is mean to another. There isn't really any deep message or educational component, but, as a parent who is looking for a short bit of quality entertainment, I am really impressed with this one. Highly recommended!",1521936000,,627,4.709090909090909
