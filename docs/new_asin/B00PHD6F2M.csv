6802349,5,B00PHD6F2M,This is perfect! I bought the books and the video to help my 2 and 3 year have a little better understanding about their upcoming baby brother. The feel the video does a better job of portraying expecting a baby and after the baby's arrival. My 3 year became very excited after watching this video and is asking lots of questions about his new baby brother.,1423699200,5,357,4.424242424242424

6802372,5,B00PHD6F2M,"Daniel Tiger has been the BEST thing for our little guy. Our 2-year-old was never interested in watching TV until very recently. As a new big brother, Daniel Tiger has helped him with the transition of welcoming a little sister into the family.  Every positive thing you have heard about this show is absolutely true. The writer's of this show have done their research.  Our favorite part about the show is that Daniel and his family sing these catchy little songs for different things that he encounters in his life.  We sing Daniel's songs like ""You can be a big helper in your family""  and ""There's time for you and Baby too!"" regularly throughout our day & they always bring a smile to his face. He is ""just like Daniel Tiger"" in that he has a new little sister.

There are 3 double-episodes + 1 extended single-episode on this DVD. I highly recommend.",1470355200,,856,4.568627450980392

6802374,5,B00PHD6F2M,"I purchased this video set when I realized the ""Daniel has a baby sister"" episodes were not included with the Daniel Tiger Netflix episodes. These episodes were prefect to prepare my oldest daughter (age two & a half) for the arrival of her new baby brother.  The concepts were easy for her to understand & now that her baby brother has been born she will sing the songs she has learned from the DVD. Great show.  Great purchase.  The best prep tool we used for the arrival of a sibling!",1463184000,,487,4.388888888888889

6802393,5,B00PHD6F2M,"This movie was a Godsend!  This came out when my daughter was 2 1/2 and i was 6 months pregnant. I have no doubt that this, and this alone, was what helped my daughter to not only understand she was going to get a new brother, but to see how things would be different, and to know that mommy and daddy would be leaving her for the night to have the baby. I can not reccomend this enough to anyone trying to figure out how to explain your pregnancy to your younger child(ren).  If this is you, buy this (or stalk PBS for when it's gong to be on and DVR it like i did)... you will not be disappointed!",1449705600,,599,3.9833333333333334

6802410,5,B00PHD6F2M,"My 4 year old daughter loves Daniel Tiger.  She watched all the prior seasons and grew out of it for a bit. Now that we see he had a baby sister, she is newly interested and is watching all of those episodes.  I love that the show is soothing to adult ears (which makes a big difference as a parent) and each episode teaches a really good lesson with a catchy song that is easy to memorize.  We find ourselves singing lots of the songs in our everyday life that we learned from the show.",1441584000,,487,4.105263157894737

6802431,4,B00PHD6F2M,"For parents buying this for a young child-  we all know the wonderfulness that is Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood- It's great, but the book works better with my child. (I bought both- he's only seen the movie a couple of times as he doesn't care to pay attention, but the book we'll read over and over again!) But regardless, anything Daniel Tiger is great- I love their stories and messages/lessons. I also was impressed by this seller- they delivered it quickly and in great condition.

6802434,5,B00PHD6F2M,My son loves this show and we don't get this season on Netflix. When I heard Daniel was going to have a sister I had to buy it because my son will soon be a big brother as well.

6802445,5,B00PHD6F2M,"My two-year old loves this series. I don't have to worry about bad messages or poor English language usage in the content (issues that seems to be prevalent in so many shows).

Not sure if it was because they advertised the ""New Baby"" episodes so much on tv or what, but he always wants to watch the baby ones.  Daniel Tiger is one of the best shows for preschoolers on TV.  There are certain lessons parents can't teach their kids (because the kids just won't hear it from you), but they will happily learn these lessons from Daniel!",1427328000,3,471,4.269662921348314

8687904,3,B00PHD6F2M,"We bought this when we transitioned from two to three children.  They were 4 & 2 when the youngest was born.  They really enjoyed this and I do think it was helpful in modeling the emotional challenges that come with growing a family. I was, however, dissapointed that they didn't take the opportunity to normalize home birth, breastfeeding, Co-sleeping, or baby-led weaning... Baby Margaret is born at a scheduled time, drinks from a bottle,  has a cage in her own room,  and is spoon-fed mushed food. Another thing that didn't sit well with me was the way the program makes it a Daniel OR baby time issue... Why can't it be both? Why can't they do things together with the big brother? For a peaceful/respectful family program I had higher hopes.",1510099200,,748,4.687022900763359
