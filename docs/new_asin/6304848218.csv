8445749,1,6304848218,"""Project Vampire"" is an early 1990s blood sucking spectacle that tries to combine vampires and modern science into one badly thought out cauldron of boringness. In short, Dr. Frederick Klaus (Myron Natwick) is clearly the villain as he has a Germanic accent and is a professor of molecular biology. (Oh, and he has a plan to take over the world, of course.) He has come up with Project Alpha, a way for people to live longer through vampirism, but it requires his antidote to make the vampires able to withstand sunlight. Along the way there are numerous caricatures of characters that you would expect, a nurse embroiled in the plot who has a heart of gold, a brilliant Asian DNA researcher who comically programs the university computer, several vampires of ill repute, etc. The protagonist is Victor Hunter (Brian Knudson) who used to be an intern of some sort at Project Alpha, and despite his learned background, turns out to be a mighty vampire slayer.

The plot is extremely predictable, and most of the movie is very low budget (most of the effects budget seemingly got used up on one of the evil laboratory machines.) The film jolts from one subplot to another, and much of it is extraneous to the story, but if you cut all the nonessential elements out the movie would be about 15 minutes long. The film has no scares, terribly bad acting, and poor pacing. The conclusion leaves some questions unanswered, which I hope was an intentional directorial choice but don't know for sure. The final scene of the mighty triumvirate on the railroad tracks was amazingly daffy and formulaic.

There are many better vampire movies to watch. For those who feel a need to see every vampire film they can get their hands on, this has to be near the end of their priority list. If you are really determined to watch this, it's now available on DVD as part of the two DVD set titled ""Blood Thirst"" which features other equally deplorable horror movies.",1322956800,,1946,4.703812316715543

8445751,3,6304848218,"Project Vampire is no cinematic gem, but I've seen many a vampire movie worse than this one.  It does at least dare to be a little different, a couple of the main characters are actually likable, and some thought (but little money) seemed to go into the story and the big climax at the end.  Dr. Frederick Klaus (Myron Natwick) is &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; a vampire.  By day, thanks to his super nifty ""antidote"" that allows him to survive in the daylight, he is known as a great man of science, but his real work consists of trying to take over the world.  He has created a ""superserum"" that turns people into vampires, and he is now distributing his special little concoction to major cities throughout the world; how this plan leads to world domination is a little fuzzy, but at least the guy is out there being a proper evil minion by hatching nefarious plots to subject the world to his arrogant will.  All those silly humans think Project Alpha is a life-extension project and that the serum will increase their life spans dramatically.  Three of the Project's interns have rebelled and escaped, however, serving as the chink in the bad guy's armor; once again, you can see how Klaus is trying to be a right and proper bad guy by facing silly do-gooders who can somehow overcome their own incompetence and destroy his mad and evil dreams.  Anyway, one of the traitors, Victor Hunter (Brian Knudson) remains elusive, helped by nursing student Sandra Jensen (Mary-Louise Gemmill) and her friend (and the film's comic relief) Dr. Lee Fong (Christopher Cho).  Dr. Lee is good for a few laughs along the way, demonstrating a remarkable ability for completely changing his mind about something at the drop of a hat.  There's a lot of chasing going on, a few rather unimpressive deaths, a fair share of Austrian accents being spoken, and all sorts of things you would expect in a vampire movie.  The climax is at least respectable in the special effects department, and the whole cast and crew is so happy with it that they decide to stop right there and simply ignore all of the questions that remain unanswered.  Maybe it's better that way, to tell the truth.",1072396800,2,2166,4.6587926509186355
8445752,1,6304848218,"The rental version of this tape says a ADULT MATERIAL: must be 18 to rent.  After viewing this movie, I've found it nothing more of PG-13! I have decided that the only reason it says Adult material is to peak intrest in  this slow,  un-original, turkey of a movie.  It's all about a vampire  working as a collage professor who wants to make more vampiers for some  reason never realy explaind.  He makes a chemical which turns people in to  vampires.  Thats it.  No more plot.  The villian is defeated in the end and  our hero goes of with the female lead.  BORING!! it was tough to sit  through this movie!  Take my advice and skip this one.",924134400,4,642,4.322033898305085
