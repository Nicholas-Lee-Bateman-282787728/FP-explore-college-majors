6603559,5,B00MWP70SG,"This review refers to the 2014 box set...

Wow! This is the set Taxi fans have been waiting for since TV series started being released on dvd. It contains all five seasons on 17 single sided discs and for the most part they are all the original broadcast episodes. There have been a few minor changes mainly to do with music licensing but don't let that put you off purchasing if you are a fan. This is the first time I've purchased Taxi for home video so I'm not 100% sure what to look for in regard to uncut episodes but considering the run time of each one I can quite confidently say it's all here. If you have any specific questions feel free to contact me via the comments below and I'll try to answer them. I've also attached a couple of pictures of the packaging so people can see what it looks like. Outstanding!",1419897600,103,821,4.262820512820513

6603584,4,B00MWP70SG,"A very funny series. I never grow tired of it. But I suggest sticking with seasons 1-3. Starting with season 4, the show really went downhill. Bobby Wheeler leaves the show for good, and now  Latka always shows up as one of his multiple personalities. Not funny and very annoying. The writers tried to throw on a lot of seriousness starting from season 4, but it just doesn't work. Taxi is supposed to be a comedy show. The acting also feels contrived and overdone starting with season 4. Basically, the magic that made Taxi so funny and special is dead in season 4 and 5. Stick with seasons 1-3 for good laughs, fresh acting, and original stories.",1514419200,7,648,4.538461538461538
6603585,4,B00MWP70SG,"Just got it today. Fast shipping! No protection in the packaging. Disc case itself is not so great so I popped Season 1 disc1 in the DVD player. Played great. It has a menu to choose what episode you want to watch. Video quality is decent for a cheap set. Audio quality is not so good. It is very quiet. So you have to crank up the volume to hear it. Then it is crackly and annoying.  I have a Vizio sound bar so it made the audio quality better. I only watched one episode so I cannot comment on the rest of the series. Original laugh tracks have not been removed. Whether or not this is a pirated copy, I don't know. The quality is good if it is!

6603589,5,B00MWP70SG,"5 Stars.  I cannot thank James L. Brooks enough for the vast plethora of classic comedies he's given us over the years, and this one is does not disappoint.  All of the characters are authentic, unique, likeable, and funny.  The storylines are SO realistic - unlike modern comedies where everyone's a brain dead, perverted swine.  It's relatable.  We've all been through these situations and know just how uplifting, heartbreaking, or life changing they can be.  The writing is natural and the humanity is refreshing.  I also love that it has a ""stage set"", meaning the actors act largely on one set, giving a ""live stage performance"" vibration.  The theme song is also absolutely beautiful.  You watch the opening credits to this show and your muscles relax.  Everything's okay, you're with friends now.

I have the entire series on DVD because it's one you can rewatch many times.  It's soothing, it's entertaining, and these people become part of your family.  Danny DeVito is ICONIC.  He gives himself fully to this performance and you feel him dive full throttle to get the audience laughs.  Judd Hirsh is wonderful.  He's everything sincere, genuine, with a soft heroism that makes him the person you would call if you ever needed anything.  Christopher Lloyd is the scene stealer.  I can't take my eyes off of him.  Of course I've seen him in Back to the Future but I must confess that Reverend Jim may be even more dear to my heart than Doc Brown.  Marilu Henner adds the feminine perspective to this group effortlessly, adding a little spice and lot of grace.

Excellent show.  One for all time.",1510876800,,1604,4.798534798534798

6603605,5,B00MWP70SG,"One of the best comedies ever made.  Modern comedies need to take a lesson from shows like Taxi.  Every comedy being produced today, with very few exceptions, seem to offer nothing more than humorous stories, week after week, about the characters romantic relationships (which gets boring real quick).  Taxi, as with other timeless classics, offers great characters with distinct personalities and depth beyond their sexual insecurities/desires.  Dont get me wrong: Episodes about a character's love-life can be hysterically funny, but I usually demand more depth over the course of the full series of a comedy show.  Taxi gives you stories about each character: family, friends, work, dreams, regrets, morality, etc...  Even though some of the fashions and hairstyles are dated (obviously), the show's humor is still top shelf.  As far as I can tell, the show is not poorly re-edited like some other modern releases of older comedies.  The case is plastic and the discs are held in it efficiently and firmly, like pages in a book.  My only complaint is that the ""book"" is not attached onto the ""spine"" of the case.  Other than that, take my advice:  Dont pass on this one.",1497312000,2,1173,4.994845360824742

6603635,5,B00MWP70SG,"TAXI-THE COMPLETE SERIES: One of the best workplace ensemble sitcoms of the late seventies/early eighties, TAXI focused on a motley group of hacks who spent their down time in the grubby interior of Manhattan's Sunshine Cab Company. Star JUDD HIRSH was voice of reason ALEX REIGER, who dispensed advice to his career chasing buddies, including vain Hollywood wannabe BOBBY WHEELER, brainless boxer TONY DANZA and divorced mom/art world hopeful ELAINE NARDO. Outstanding in their roles were CHRISTOPHER LLOYD's unforgettable stoner JIM ""IGGY"" IGNATOWSKI (""What...does...a...yellow...light...mean?""), ANDY KAUFMAN as nave foreign mechanic LATKA GRAVAS (who eventually married CAROL KANE's loopy, helium-voiced SIMKA) and DANNY DEVITO's despicable dispatcher LOUIE DEPALMA, the greatest TV villain of his era. Guests included RUTH GORDON, MARTIN MULL and TOM SELLECK, but the emphasis was on the show's likeable cast and intelligent plotlines (which occasionally carried serious overtones). Five fun-filled seasons and eighteen Emmys later, TAXI rode off into the sunset, one of television's most finely tuned road trips.

For some reason- they did a bad job of recording the last two seasons. It has distorting picture quality- not really bad but it is noticeable bothersome after watching better quality in seasons 1-3.

Because of this- I gave half stars.",1463616000,3,400,4.405405405405405

All the characters clicked from the start of Episode 1 unlike some other shows that take a few years for that to happen.  However, I did forget that the super annoying and forgettable Randall Carver was in Season 1 since he became a very distant memory by the last season.

I like the show. I use to didn't like it, but here a few years ago when it started coming on tv, I started liking it. That Danny Devito is a creak up. Listing to him is what makes the show better.

Well worth the money already. Quality of footage doesn't stand up too well to today's standards (I Almost gave only 4 stars because of this)...but I Sure didn't buy it for that.

6603682,5,B00MWP70SG,"This series gloriously launched a number of actors whose fame we take for granted nowadays.  The series is as fresh today as it was all those years ago.  With over 90 episodes there are only a few that dip below the very high standard of comedy that Taxi brought us.  The picture quality is not up to today's high resolution but that goes unnoticed after the very first minute.  This is one of those very few video experiences that it's possible to watch over and over again.  The sheer genius of Danny de Vito, of Christopher Lloyd, of the late great ""Latka"" and of his eccentric wife is a constant source of pleasure and amazement throughout the series.  Do you get the impression that I like ""Taxi"" ... and the theme tune!!",1444089600,2,726,4.462121212121212
6603683,5,B00MWP70SG,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""Taxi"" was one of those series.  Original writers Glen Charles and Les Charles, along with director James Burrows, went on to create ""Cheers,"" ""Wings,"" and ""Frasier.""  In the TV series ""Taxi,"" Judd Hirsch starred as Alex Rieger, the level-headed, life-long taxi driver, who everyone turned to for advice.  Danny DeVito played Louie De Palma, the head dispatcher for the Sunshine Cab Company.  His sleazy, mean-spirited, amoral character was one of the most memorable characters in TV sitcom history.  Danny became a successful star after this series.  Speaking of characters, the brilliant Andy Kaufman played Latka Gravas, an immigrant from an unnamed foreign country, who worked as a mechanic.  Carol Kane played Simka, a native of Latka's country, who married Latka in season four.  Christopher Lloyd played Reverend Jim Ignatowski, the burned out, spaced out taxi driver.  IMHO, the season two episode, ""Reverend Jim: A Space Odyssey,"" when Jim took an exam to become a taxi driver, was the funniest episode of the series.  Christopher became a successful star after this series.

Tony Danza played Tony Banta, a mediocre boxer who also drove a taxi.  Tony became a successful star after this series.  Jeff Conaway played Bobby Wheeler, a struggling actor who drove a taxi to earn a steady income.  Unfortunately, Jeff's drug addiction lead to his leaving the series in season four.  Last but not least is the beautiful Marilu Henner, who played Elaine Nardo, a divorced mother of two, who worked as a receptionist in an art gallery, in addition to driving a cab.  That's an all-star cast if ever there was one, with apologies to Randall Carver, who only played taxi driver John Burns in the first season.  After four seasons, ABC cancelled the series.  NBC picked up the series for its fifth and final season.  The fifth season is bittersweet, including the death of Jim's father, the death of Alex's dog, Alex hitting rock bottom as a gambling addict, and Louie's former girlfriend Zena Sherman (Rhea Perlman) marrying another man.  Surprisingly, the very last episode is a regular episode that doesn't tie up loose ends, or wrap up the series in any way.  The good news is, this box set includes all five seasons.  The colors were somewhat sharp, and the audio was clear. The bad news is, other than commercials (promos) for episodes, and a couple of series promos, there are no bonus features. There are no cast commentaries, interviews, bloopers, or even animated menus.  That shouldn't deter anyone from purchasing the complete series of one of the best sitcoms in television history.",1443657600,5,2727,5.011111111111111

Usually with these boxed sets you get some cheap cardboard box to store them in with little paper envelopes to slip the disc into. Not this set! Packaging is awesome with plastic backing to attach each disc to and every episode is listed inside the case.

6603688,5,B00MWP70SG,"There was another review of this product which incorrectly stated that this set was the shortened syndicated version of the show, and so should be avoided. I've done a lot of research on TAXI and this set (which I own) and I can absolutely confirm that these discs are NOT the shortened syndicated versions. Each episodes runs for approximately 24:30, which is exactly how long the original episodes ran for in the late 70s/early 80s. (Syndicated episodes are edited down to 22 minutes.)

One particular avid TAXI fan assures me that there is actually EXTRA footage in some of the episodes which never made it to the original broadcast. That was actually a sweet surprise, and while these new lines aren't always essential, they are definitely welcomed. (One such instance is when Jim goes back to visit his father. Alex goes with him, and the dialogue between Jim, Alex, and his father is more than when originally first aired. There are several episodes where this is the case, some featuring a ...

Can't comment on any special features since we haven't made it that far into the set. Plus the features aren't as important to me. What is important is having the complete show unedited and looking good. And this set delivers that.  Oh and the packaging is nice.
