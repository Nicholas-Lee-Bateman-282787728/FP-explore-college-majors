4327903,5,B004CN7KR2,"This is a wonderful DVD for any martial artist, regardless of the style they practice.  From stretches, to rolls and Qi Gong exercises.  The instructions are clear and easy to understand, performed by students of Dr. Yang, so you can see how they are performed and how to perform them yourself, in addition to the spoken instruction.  Adding this DVD to your martial arts training collection would be one of the best investments you can make in your martial arts life.",1300579200,,468,4.753086419753086
4327904,5,B004CN7KR2,"When I saw the trailers for this video on YouTube, I saw a bunch of young men in their twenties doing amazingly athletic feats.  I wondered if the dvd would have anything for me as a fit (but no longer twenty) woman in my fifties.  I was pleased to find that it did.  The stretching, range of motion, and qigong exercises are good for anyone.  The more athletic conditioning exercises have beginning and advanced versions, and the presenters include details on how to modify the exercise if you have injuries.  This dvd is as useful to athletic twenty-somethings as it is to anyone whose age or minor injuries still allow them to train a martial arts style.  I'll be incorporating several of these exercises in my karate classes.

4327905,5,B004CN7KR2,"I really enjoyed going thru Kung Fu Body Conditioning, as both a personal trainer (NSCA certified) and a Martial Arts instructor (Yang Taiji Quan) I learned some new exercises to incorporate into my own training as well as my students and clients. This would be good for anyone who is interested in improving the Martial arts or their body in general.",1325376000,,351,4.770491803278689
4327906,5,B004CN7KR2,"I'm a fan of Dr. Yang for his Understand QiGong series and some of his books, but this DVD is probably
my favorite of all.  I was looking for authentic Shaolin exercises, QiGongs and mind training, and
I just so happened to see Kung Fu Body Conditioning.  The warm ups are a great exercise for building
up elasticity and fluid in the joints (harmonies), and the strength exercises are tremendous.  No nonsense,
delivered by students of Dr. Yang and the man himself.  Demonstrations were perfect, no fluff.  I can't
say enough good about this one.  If you want to train for Internal Arts or just to train, and you want
time tested material, here it is.
$37???  I've been charged $20 an hour to have someone tell me knuckle push ups and squats was Kung Fu conditioning.
Just wonderful.",1315612800,18,783,4.589928057553957
4327907,5,B004CN7KR2,"Dr. Yang and his body of students, nestled in the beautiful mountains of Miranda, California, conduct a solid tutorial pertaining to traditional methods of specific body/mind conditioning, pertaining to the goals for developing a strong, enduring, balanced body and mind needed for owning a power and grace in the martial disciplines.

The organization of the materials is progressive, were we begin with relaxation drills and stretching exercises, preparing both mind and body for the ensuing vigor.  Through this initial segment the focus is on controlling our breathing, how this facilitates a relaxed body and mind, whereby the subsequent stretching is soft, gentle, supple and specific to the needs of the martial practitioner.

Body Calisthenics for preparing our musculature, follow the stretching, and some of the exercises are unique to traditional Chinese martial practices.  These exercises focus on developing a strong but flexible musculature needed for maximizing one's performance in martial arts activity.

There are tumbling actions, also taught, in a very precise fashion, step by step, that will aid in the full comprehension of the exercises, but also assist the practitioner `s well-being in understanding how to fall and protect the body from impacting the ground.  These activities provide the viewer a much needed inspection of functional fitness for the individual pursuing a martial arts lifestyle.

Qi Gong meditation is covered in detail, where Dr. Yang provides the viewer with the subtle breathing and body manipulations required to gain the full benefit of deeper Qi Gong meditation.  His explanations remove any esoteric assumptions of what is good Qi Gong with actual applications, focusing on our own unique body structure and function.

The outdoor training segment engages nature in a vigorous and continuous fashion, demonstrating an entire spectrum of body strengthening exercises with simple training tools and devises found in nature or easily constructed from basic materials.  Actions of the demonstrations address developing agility, coordination and stamina needed for the complete well-conditioned practitioner.

Much of what is shown and instructed might be said to be minimalist training in that the equipment used is simple, basic and innovative in its application.  Actually, we will not find fancy equipment and high tech gear being used.  What is available in this natural environment, are much of what one would have found within an ancient Chinese Taoist farm community: dirt roads, hills, rocks, blocks, ropes, streams, poles, bundles, beams, trees and the like; truly traditional in every aspect.

My self, having been engaged in the martial arts training for fifty years, and having done the harder, harsher modern weight training, explosive heavy weight lifting and brutal interval training, all of which, in the long term, destroyed my body, as it momentarily built up my body, I am beginning to find natural training, using body weight resistance and train the way my body used to move when I worked on my family's farm as a child growing up, to be healthier, with long term benefits modern training lacks.

Traditional martial arts practices as promoted and taught in this DVD are uniquely functional and applicable: simple, specific, but very vigorous and demanding.  I believe this may be a beginning of a return to a more useful and less destructive way for training, specifically for martial practices, where long term benefits can be maintained well into a person's senior category of practice.

Very well done with superb instruction, overall.",1315180800,6,3609,5.404634581105169
4327908,5,B004CN7KR2,"Usually I am a little leary of dvd's that consist of body conditioning exercises. But When I saw the title for ""Kung Fu Body Conditioning for Endurance and Power"", I thought I'd give it a try. The video was excellent and the exercises where surprising very beneficial.

The dvd is broken up into 5 parts: Part 1: Stretch and warm up, Part 2: Conditioning Training (Arms, hands, legs, torso), Part 3: Tumbling, Part 4: Qigong and meditation, and Part 5: Outdoor Training. Theses are all broken down further into different exercises that work different parts of your body. The meditation section alone is worth its weight in gold.

You will learn to center yourself better, strenthen your ligaments, muscles, and bones, become more flexible and explosive, your root will become more powerful, your spine and internal organs will achieve a level of health you have never felt before, and your endurance will skyrocket.

Working as a patrol officer, I have found these exercises more manageable both with time and more reflective of what I can use on the job. If you lead an active outdoor lifestyle, or even if, you want to try something new, this will not disappoint. No gym is needed, just your body, a yard, and your imagination.

I would like to express a heartfelt ""Thank you"", to Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, and his students for putting out such a wonderful and beneficial video.",1309651200,2,1376,4.817796610169491
4327909,5,B004CN7KR2,"I have a large amount of martial arts related dvd's and this remains one of my favorites. The varied techniques shown on this dvd will not only help martial artists but anyone looking to strengthen the body and mind. The dvd focuses on strengthening a person's entire body, mind and spirit and if one follows the techniques they should see a difference in all aspects.

4327910,5,B004CN7KR2,"Unlike many other YMAA DVDs. this video is presented mostly by students of Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. However, it continues to adhere to the excellent quality typical of YMMA products in general.

When the DVD arrived and I got a good look at the cover photo I was a bit concerned that the exercises would be too intense for me. Fortunately, this was not the case. While the exercises can reach a level of significant intensity, they start with fairly simple warm-ups and provide a step-wise progression that allowed me to adapt them to my less intense conditioning objectives.

I gave these exercises a try because I was looking for more traditional exercises that did not require a gym and a lot of expensive equipment. I feel that this DVD gave me what I was looking for.",1304294400,4,769,4.647058823529412
4327911,5,B004CN7KR2,"For those of you who have been looking at YMAA products, I will have to say that I'm totally hooked.  Dr Yang is almost single-handedly bringing authentic ancient knowledge from an ancient land into the modern and Western world which would've otherwise been lost without him and others like him preserving and sharing this knowledge.

One thing I am most interested in regarding the Chinese martial arts is that my son studies tae kwon do (Korean art) and I have studied aikido (Japanese art), so we're definitely lacking in information regarding these more obscure martial arts.  These videos help to round out our martial education.

Also, the information in this video allow us to have turn anywhere into our own personal gym, no matter where we are.",1304208000,4,753,4.905511811023622
4327912,5,B004CN7KR2,"This DVD presentation was performed by six students of the YMAA Retreat Center, with Dr. Yang leading the discussion about Qigong and Meditation section.  The video content is split into five sections:  1. Stretching and Warm Up, 2. Conditioning Training, 3. Tumbling, 4.  Qigong and Meditation, and 5. Outdoor Training.  A full training regimen is presented, well worth the $39.95 price point.

  Numerous stretching exercises are presented at a practice-along pace and specifically chosen to be those stretches most meaningful to the martial arts practitioner.  Presentation by students and setting validate that exercises shown are attainable and not overly or outright rigorous.  Conditioning exercises are often presented in a step-wise manner such that practitioners can start from a ""beginner"" level and progress forward at their own pace as strength improves.
  Inclusion of Qigong and Mediation was unexpected, yet a welcome, inclusion to a video about martial arts conditioning (after all, mind and breathing conditioning is equally as important to physical conditioning).  Several breathing methods are presented, from seated normal and reverse breathing to Grand Circulation breathing and meditation.  Several recovery exercises are presented as a `cool down' to meditation practice.

  In addition to the physical and explosive strength improvements developed by tumbling and gymnastic exercise, the tumbling presentation covers an often overlooked component to martial arts training:  break-falls.  Again, exercises are presented in a step-wise manner in a way that leaves the viewer with an ""I can do that"" impression to approaching the curriculum.
Finally, the outdoor training methods presented could be considered to be fun.  Opening section scenes are reminiscent of a Shaolin Temple flick, with students running up trees, hopping fences, running along narrow banisters, and taking tumbling dives. The viewer will be familiar with many of the standard exercises which include pull-ups, chin-ups, running, and jumping.

This DVD presentation offers a great addition to any practitioner's resource and video library. At 240 minutes, the DVD is long enough to contain the viewer's interest while sparking motivation.  DVD offers a variety of training methods that may introduce the viewer into new training regiment ideas to supplement any current training.  Best of all, the methods presented are simple, mandatory, and effective.  At least, THIS viewer is looking forward to DVD 2 to see what challenges await!",1301356800,6,2528,5.647214854111406
4327913,5,B004CN7KR2,"Kung Fu Body Conditioning is traditional in it's approach. This fine DVD will set you on the path to having a better feel for what it means to be in shape and have good health. The demonstrators begin by telling you that they rise very early at the YMAA Retreat Center and run several miles before even beginning their morning exercises. They move on to perform many body conditioning movements that you will be able to manage. The movements are shown from various camera angles. Young men take turns describing the movements while a partner performs the set. You are given ways to adjust movements and work up to more strenuous versions of the exercises, as your body gets stronger.  They take the time to perform many sets of each segment, so that you can use the DVD to pace your own workout.

The cover artwork shows a young man standing post on a stack of bricks and also lying across two chairs like a plank. Don't be scared off of this DVD if you know you are not ready for these two sets. You are shown how to do them while standing on the floor or just one brick and lying flat on the ground instead of the chairs. I found the brick to be very useful in my own pursuit of a better root for tai chi. As my ankles get stronger, I will be adding more bricks.

Having taken years of tai chi classes with teachers of all levels, I now realize that the traditional way to train is to get the body strong and then learn forms and applications. Too many times, in the Western version of teaching Tai Chi, forms are taught as a dance like movement and not enough emphasis is put on power, strength and endurance.  We are told to relax and enjoy and not made to work and improve the body and health. This course will be a way for you to get stronger and in better condition, for martial arts or daily living. Kung Fu Body Conditioning uses proven Traditional ways of building strong chi, you won't be sorry if you try it.",1301184000,,1920,4.295580110497237
4327914,5,B004CN7KR2,"From simple warm-ups to extreme feats of self-control, this video takes the viewer step-by-step through each exercise.  Important details about body positioning and background theory help to clarify the correct practice and goals of everything from seated meditation to leaping over bannisters.  This was insightful and will definitely improve my practice at home.  Only complaint: more out-takes, please!",1300579200,,405,5.948275862068965
8423266,5,B004CN7KR2,This is an excellent video; full of information valuable to any martial artist. In an easy to understand format that builds upon each lesson learned as one continues to improve in progress.,1453852800,,189,4.9375

8423268,5,B004CN7KR2,"The purpose of the information in this 2-dvd series is to establish the first necessary step in martial arts training - to put the student's body into excellent condition in preparation for the rigors of the martial arts training to come....both to develop the student's strength to properly perform that training, as well as to help strengthen the body's defense against injuries.

There is a wealth of clearly-presented information and guidance for each of the different conditioning exercises.  In addition, variations of different degrees of difficulty are presented to continually challenge the student as he or she gains strength and endurance in their progression from beginning to advanced stages.  Although some of the advanced conditioning exercises might appear to be extremely difficult to some people, there is so much helpful information that is of great value; and conditioning exercises, stretches, range of motion movements and meditation that are of immediate benefit and ARE possible right now to a beginner.  And, as the student attends to the things that they can do at this time, they will discover that they are doing things that at one time seemed impossible to them.

I recall occasions where Dr. Yang has mentioned on other dvds that skills in martial arts, as well as other aspects of internal and external training, result only from long and dedicated work; and this 2-dvd series is a good reminder of that.  But, this information clearly shows the student the way to establish an excellent physical and mental foundation for those skills to develop upon.",1419033600,,1583,5.1640625
8423269,5,B004CN7KR2,This is a great DVD for understanding the techniques of body conditioning. Most of the exercises require no special tools or equipment. There is some exercises that requires some bricks which I was able to pick up at the store for 5 to 6 dollars. I have been using the DVD for about a week now and I am starting to notice some differences especially in abdomen and root. I would recommend this DVD as a great place to start developing your routine for body conditioning.,1408320000,2,470,4.476744186046512
8423270,4,B004CN7KR2,"Dr. Yang Jwing Ming's Kung Fu Body conditioning is an excellent DVD to help improve your overall martial arts skill and fitness. This YMAA video covers many areas crucial to martial conditioning such as stretching, tumbling, strength training, skill development, horse stance training, and more. What I appreciated about the video was the explanations before the commencement of the actual exercises and the brief explanations as to why one would do these exercises. Another plus for me is the emphasis on traditional methods of conditioning ( I think we have overlooked many of the benefits of traditional conditioning) and the inclusion of modern equipment (pull up bars, etc.). Dr. Yang (and his students') expertise really shine through in this video and their hard work in doing these exercises shine through.
Kung Fu Body Conditioning, in my opinion, can be used as a supplement to your martial arts conditioning program, but some of the techniques(especially the tumbling section) should be done under qualified supervision to avoid serious injury. One of the things I would have liked would have been the inclusion of some type of frequency as a graphic or included with the DVD. For example, ""5 days a week horse stance training hold for 1 minute then progress to 2 minutes in the second week, etc.""  Overall, Kung Fu Body Conditioning is an excellent addition to the training library of any martial artist, MMA practitioner! fitness enthusiast, or anyone looking to develop internal and external strength.",1390608000,,1515,5.158536585365853
8423271,2,B004CN7KR2,"once again a perfect example of a thoroughly and craftily designed advert for Yang's training centre/camp. if you need a bootcamp, find yourself another source of 'wisdom'. as with quite a few ymaa products the main goal is either to overwhelm with information (see any of yang's thorough and detailed histories and roots of qigong) and to make an impression of the ultimate guru, or to impress and hook (any of the weaponry or shaolin series).  my main problem with these look-like-instructional videos is that they have never been designed to assist current practitioners of wushu / or internal arts nor can they possibly achieve that effect - the vital information, as u will always find, will remain missing - how you actually strengthen your health using nei gong to the level when u can actually start thinking of hard conditioning; without the internal training knowledge this is nothing but a potentially dangerous advert for yang's school if not used properly.",1383177600,5,969,5.0186335403726705
8423272,2,B004CN7KR2,"I bought this DVD, along with part two, with the hope of getting in shape before attending a formal kung fu class, but I was planning to do it at home. This DVDs show the way they train at Dr. Yang's center, it's not for training in my living room. I won't climb up trees, or lie down with a brick on my belly, or use stilts. I know, two of my examples come from the actual covers of the DVDs, so I maybe it's my fault for not thinking this more carefully. I now ordered Georges St. Pierre's Rushfit DVD series; it's not kung fu, but I think it's more what I need.",1372636800,8,564,3.956140350877193
8423273,5,B004CN7KR2,"Kung Fu Body is an interesting and informative DVD which uses several disciplines to get the student into top physical shape. It is a very well done DVD using martial arts students to both teach and demonstrate the physical and mental exercises.

The DVD is sorted into several chapters, the first one is a stretch and warm-up routine. The student gets quite a workout in the chapter of Conditioning and Training by following the demonstrations of exercises, some of which I never thought of or seen before. The movements are gradual from simple to more complex which can be reached over a short period of time. They go from simple finger movements to complete full body exercises. The Tumbling exercises may be more difficult for most but they can be done in a proper and safe setting. During the specific exercises the demonstrators emphasize that safety precautions should be exercised.

There is a great segment on Qigong and Meditation which can be practiced by everyone. This chapter is no less important than the physical exercises. Dr. Yang explains and demonstrates the breathing and recovery exercises and meditation techniques. Dr. Yang talks about the theory and reasons for meditation and how this benefits the students of martial arts.

There are also segments which demonstrate Outdoor Training which incorporate training for arms, hands and legs; all of which can lead to building and toning of major muscle groups. Included in this chapter are staff training, use of the training bar, jumping techniques and mountain running.

Overall, this is the DVD to be used for the person who wants a complete physical and mental training program. I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in a healthy body and martial arts.",1350172800,2,1741,5.034722222222222
