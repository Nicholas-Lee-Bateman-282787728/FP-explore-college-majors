If you are a fan of supernatural tales, incredible writing and unique characters --- you owe it to yourself to check ""Carnivale"" out.

Believe me you are going to get you monys worth. its a nice series that is going to keep ypu waiting for more. Now if you are one of those people who like hardcore season finalies episodes, you my not like this one...",1093910400,3,244,3.979591836734694
2145657,1,B0002YLC1U,I've tried to watch the first episode several times and can't even get half way through it. It's incredibly boring and poorly made so I gave up on it.,1514764800,,150,4.206896551724138
2145658,5,B0002YLC1U,When is the new season this was an awesome show,1514332800,,47,3.8

2145663,2,B0002YLC1U,Dark. Confusing. Sexually explicit. Nudity. One scene could be deemed soft porn. I stopped watching after episode 1 Season 2. I got through Season 1 but toward the last few episodes had a feeling to no longer waste my time and find something enriching to watch.,1511827200,3,261,4.695652173913044
2145664,5,B0002YLC1U,"Think of the movie ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" (1983, author Ray Bradbury, actor Jason Robards, extraordinary), all updated and fleshed out for a full two seasons, with a bit of David Lynch (""Twin Peaks"") alternate reality thrown in, set in a John Steinbeck (""Grapes of Wrath"") novel. Not for everyone, but well worth the indulgence if you are so inclined. Excellent writing, acting, impressive cast of well known character actors, well funded production. Richly faceted story line with both spooky wierdness and great heart. Many wonderful surprises along the way, mainly in casting. If you stream on your computer, keep two browser windows open. One for ""Carnivale"", and one for the IMDB ""Carnivale"" cast page. You will be flipping back and forth, ""I have seen them before..."". ENJOY!",1509753600,3,792,5.147286821705427

2145687,5,B0002YLC1U,Who ever decided to cancel this series should be ashamed. The cast of characters is amazing and the story line is riveting. I was hooked and binge watched it for days. Are you listening HBO and Amazon.. How about a Season 3..,1506816000,,225,4.380952380952381

2145716,4,B0002YLC1U,Quickly builds a mystery then slowly reveals it. A bit disjointed at times. Interesting take on the cosmic struggle of good and evil with a sideline in the life of a carny in the 30's.,1503273600,,184,4.285714285714286
2145717,5,B0002YLC1U,"A fantastic series.  Show was cut too early.  Should have had many more seasons!  Character development and storyline was really getting phenomenally developed in Season 2.

2145718,5,B0002YLC1U,If it's hard starting for you just stick with it a few more episodes. It definitely gets going but it might not be the quickest to draw you in. If you can't give it a chance there are plenty of two hour movies out. This one steadily pulls you in deeper and deeper. I've finished Season 2 and I want more! It will be hard to start another series now.,1501545600,,349,4.0

2145722,5,B0002YLC1U,It's a very weird show. You really have to pay attention. There are different plots that keep it interesting. I hope the whomever is producing this show decides to do a Season 3. I'm going to go back and watch it again to pick up what I missed the first time around. Love it.,1497484800,,275,4.111111111111111

2145736,5,B0002YLC1U,I love it! Someone needs to finish making this show. I love the characters and was really invested in the story. Even if they have to pick it with different actors I would still totally watch. I do feel like they left me hangin'.,1492905600,,229,4.2272727272727275
2145737,5,B0002YLC1U,"I love this show so much I've watched it at least 3 times since it came out and every time I appreciate it more. The first season is really all about character development so it can seem kind of slow...but hang in there because the carnies are some of my favorite characters. Season 2 is when it starts getting exciting. It's such a shame that HBO canceled it before they were able to finish the story. If you are into quirky things, freakshows, or anything 1930's I highly recommend this show.",1489363200,,494,4.43956043956044
2145738,4,B0002YLC1U,Never had a season II...liked the show. It was different.,1489104000,,57,4.8
2145739,5,B0002YLC1U,"This is a highly entertaining series with a pronounced focus on basic Judeo-Christian themes which are incorporated within a complex subtext of occultism and a documentary styled scrutinization of a variety of societal issues; all of which serve to establish the foundation upon which the storyline is conveyed.

In this finely tuned variation of the all too familiar theme of good vs evil, Christ vs anti-Christ, dwells a cornucopia of riveting interactive stories regarding each of the characters, which is crucial to underscoring this much debated theological supposition.

The plot tackles the ideas of damnation, redemption and the catalytic nature of presumptive actions taken by the various members of a group of societal outcasts who are the backbone of a wandering carnival.

The supporting cast also serve an important function as the voices of a classical Greek Chorus by default; even the stage name assigned to one of the female characters is Apollonia, who is a mute clairvoyant; a type of Delphic oracular figure who is incapable of speech and communicates telepathically with two other members of the cast; they being the symbolic embodiment of the 3 Fates.

In one episode, the troupe travels to a small town that is aptly named Babylon, and in the ensuing cascade of events that culminate in the death of one of the troupe members, it is decided that a trial must take place and a convenient sacrificial lamb is chosen to receive judgement.
Nobody in the troupe claim to understand the archaic ritual that precedes the trial which is to first circle the accused 3 times by a wagon; the symbolic nature of which speaks for itself. Then there is an enactment of Russian Roulette that is supposed to determine the ultimate fate of the accused.
The accused man is an individual who is incapable of crossing the borders of Babylon as though hes caught in a web spun by the fates.
Interestingly enough, and in the grand tradition of Greek Tragedy, a leading member of the carnival troupe takes matters into his own hands and executes the accused who, metaphorically, dodged the bullet at the trial, but is ultimately killed and thus satisfies all the defining elements of the proverbial self fulfilling prophecy. We see however that even through physical death he is still unable to escape the boundaries of this Hell cursed town.

Overall, the acting is nothing short of superlative and the circumstances that are in place to stage the ongoing events is genius. No really noteworthy story, whether it be literary, operatic or cinematic ever succeeded in a dull setting of sugar coated complacency; in this case it is the Great Depression set against the backdrop of the disastrous Dust Bowl.

Unfortunately the ending is left as either an unnecessary or unintended cliff hanger which was disappointing to say the least. Its like a dressmaker creating a sumptuous gown and ignoring the hems; a flawed beauty with unfinished, ragged edges.

Taking all this into account I would not recommend this production to those persons with very delicate and/or puritanical sensibilities, nor is this suitable for very young children. Although there is nothing overtly pornographic, the dialogue and depictions of acts of violence are conveyed in a decidedly no-holds barred, no punches pulled manner; in this sense, it should receive an adults only rating. Not even accompanied by an adult is advisable. Most parents don't enjoy answering awkward and embarrassing questions posed to them by their juvenile, prepubescent offspring, and they'll either have to blindfold the kids or spend a lot of time cupping their hands over the kids eyes and ears; which seems to me an awful nuisance and you'll miss a lot of important scenes.",1488672000,,3728,5.0324149108589955
2145740,5,B0002YLC1U,I can't believe I waited over 10 years to see this show. So creative and innovative...ahead of its time as many have said. You won't be disappointed... other than that there are only 2 seasons. :-(,1486598400,,197,4.5

2145784,5,B0002YLC1U,"Carnivale is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. The production values alone are spectacular, hearkening to old fashioned epics that can bring you to tears or some new reckoning. Unfortunately, HBO only gave this series 2 seasons and for that I will always loathe the management of that time. Watch this series if you like smart and thoughtful dialog and concepts.

I still gave it 3 stars because the story, acting, and all of the elements of high-quality visuals are amazing.

That's the 1930s for you iPhone addicted kiddies who care not of our history. The story shows how their is good and evil and the grey areas in between. It's magical and mystical.

There is a parallel story gathering steam around a minister in a small town. I'm interested in seeing what happens when the two stories collide, which I expect due to similarities between the two protagonists.

You will recognize some familiar faces in the cast. Be forewarned, this show has a dark tone, including scenes of violence, prostitution, murder, the occult, and (mostly female) nudity. My husband finds the setting depressing and will not watch it, but my curiosity has been piqued. I don't know how I missed this show when it was first aired!",1476403200,12,723,4.926229508196721

One of the best Sci-Fi series ever.  And it's set in the dust-bowl!  So unexpected!
It's a tale of good versus evil, but keeps you guessing just who is good and who is evil.

The casting is PERFECT, from the big names like Adrienne Barbeau and Nick Stahl, to the roustabouts and freaks who populate the backgrounds.  The final episode will leave you wanting more!  Every aspect of this production is top notch: art design, costumes, authentic props and lingo, and a musical score that you will forever hear in your dreams. If I could give it 6 stars, I would.

It's weird for sure but good story, good characters.  Keeps me coming back for more.  I have moved onto season 2, which is even weirder but just as good!  My only disappointment is that it only has 2 seasons.  I have one last episode to watch (the final episode!) and I keep putting it off because then it's over.  :-(",1468540800,,486,4.322222222222222

2146513,4,B0002YLC1U,Suffers somewhat from a lack of focus and an undeveloped sense of the the macabre. Wish it was a bit eerier in a less esoteric way. Think a bit fewer story lines and perhaps more background on the more interesting characters might have enhanced the appeal.  Should have had the courage to use more people with actual physical limitations aka Todd Brownings cult movie Freaks!! All in all I did find myself hooked!,1464998400,2,413,4.657534246575342
2146514,3,B0002YLC1U,It starts out good and has a good back story. Then it just slows down. It's one of those shows for me that looks promising but then you just watch it out of boredom.,1464998400,,165,3.8823529411764706

Why did I have to watch this show if they did not complete the whole T.V. series? Want to go tell HBO to give them the extra of the $2 million dollars they needed to make the rest of the seasons. Do not want to spoil the show itself. Just want to say that it was very well directed, keeps you guessing and had right descriptions for terminology they used for that time period.

2146636,5,B0002YLC1U,"I found this show to be engrossing and well done.  It does a great job creating the atmosphere of a depression era carnival.  There are two reasons you might decide not to watch.  First, you might be concerned that it ends with too many unresolved plot points because the series was unexpectedly cancelled after two seasons.  However, this concern is unfounded.  The two seasons of the show tell and resolve one story quite nicely.  Near the end of the last episode, a new conflict is foreshadowed to set up the next (cancelled) season, but even this served to resolve questions about the character in question.  The other reason you may not want to watch is because you have a low tolerance for supernatural, mystical, psuedo-religious content in stories.  This reason for avoiding Carnivale would be valid.",1458518400,,808,4.889705882352941

It rivals the fascination of AHS! It's hard to believe that it ended due to poor viewership. And comparing that to the success of AHS today makes it even more disturbing how they left this series in the dust. I think HBO buried a jewel too soon.
I am absolutely devastated by the ending. They should totally revive this series, even if by a finale special of some sort with an update. I loved the characters, the storylines, the twists and turns, the symbolism, etc. It's like peeling back layers to reveal this interwoven mystery. Riveting television!

We were big fans back when it was originally released on HBO and still watch it every few years when the bug hits us.  It still holds up extremely well!  It was well written and acted.  That, and they nailed home the period feel with a jackhammer.  It was such a disappointment when HBO cancelled the show.

2146818,2,B0002YLC1U,"I choose to write my series review for the very first episode, so potential viewers can use my thoughts to see if they are willing to invest the twenty-four hours needed to watch both seasons. I recommend against the investment of such a time-commitment. First, the positives. Very well acted, superbly directed, with a brilliant, well-casted actors. Many would go on to have stellar careers. The high quality production shows through often, no expense spared and all that. Details of carnival life in general and depression life specifically are spot on and educational.
Second, the aspects which were neither positive nor negative. These qualities always challenge to constitute deadweight. Here they do more than they don't. Chief among these is series length. There was a definite stretch of the plot underway. The same show in sixteen to eighteen hours would be crisper. Also, this is a rather straight forward ""hero's journey"" or monomyth. I personally feel the genre is old and tired and over-overdone. Still if the creators insist, they need to stick with the program. One wouldn't write a child's tale where octopusi dance with snails, happy happy, up until the point where they devour the screaming food-items. That would be a horror story, not a monomyth.
So, with all my superlatives, how can I note grant five stars, minimum? Easily. I saw the ending. Without divulging a spoiler, I'll say this. The ending has two fatal flaws. First, the creators were unwilling to let go of the story and end it. It needed to be ended after twenty-four grueling episodes. If they wanted to provide an opening for a sequel, they could have do it in any of fifty other, more appropriate ways. But, the fatalist flaw was the very concept of the ending. If a story spends twenty-four episodes building a character's personality, it CANNOT be cast aside without even the interjection of dialogue! To built a strong, moral (for the most part) and independent character who in a heartbeat goes against all that - against freewill - to the opposite, well, it invalidates most of the good done creating a potentially great mini-series. In a series which rattled the saber of Independent for twenty-three hours and fifty-five minutes, to end in the last five minutes with such a mark of Hollywood was both stunning, heartbreaking, and unacceptable.",1452729600,,2336,4.976982097186701
2146819,2,B0002YLC1U,"Another HBO piece self-impressed with period settings, gratuitous nudity and a total failure to advance the characters and/or plot. It was pretty much nothing happens from one show to the next and you really didn't care what happened to anyone and little did happen. There were five characters, and a lot of time, devoted to the cooch story arch and it seemed like it was there primarily to flash a little skin. I was looking for some interesting storylines around the carnival theme and found no satisfaction as most of the cast sat around a food table or in their wagons and you never got to know much about anyone or the carnival itself other than asking yourself how they got so much material and people moved in so few vehicles. As always opinions may vary but season 2 is not in the cards.",1452124800,2,795,4.527777777777778

There is a lot of the main character seeing an image of a man with a tree tattooed on his torso throughout the series and you always wonder...who is he?,...how is this tree man connected to the main character?...who is H.S.?....and more questionable events throughout.

Can someone get Ben some clean clothes to wear, I am surprised he does not have a skin disease or something by the end of the season. Could have ended much better, Sophie is set up to be the evil one now, how disappointing is that?

I loved it. The more you watch it the more u see all the hidden meaning and novelties they put in the show. Too bad it had to compete with the sopranos and deadwood.

2147185,5,B0002YLC1U,"It's impossible to review Carnivale without danger of spoilers, so this commentary will provide generalities only. Carnivale is one of the strangest, most bizarre TV series of its time, and represented a big gamble by HBO, who produced it, since there is a lot of material that will offend some viewers in terms of sexual content, language, religion...  Briefly, the show follows the travels of a rather sleazy carnival across the Southwest in the Dust Bowl era.  The carnival has many familiar features -- freaks, fortune tellers, strippers promoted by a barker, a ferris wheel, etc.  One also gets to follow the rise of a radio Evangelist, Brother Justin, supported by his sister Iris. The casting is excellent, with many familiar faces, and the performances stellar.  (Justin, for example, will be familiar to fans of the original Highlander movie as the Highlander's arch-enemy and slayer of the Sean Connery character. This is NOT to denigrate the other cast members by comparison -- they all turn in brilliant performances.)  The carnival is managed by (what else?) ""Management,"" a mysterious presence whose identity will keep the viewer guessing well into the series, ably represented for everyday supervision by a small man named Samson.  Season 1 fascinated me, and I anxiously awaited the publication of Season 2 on DVD and bought it when it came out.  It was NOT waste of money, and the folks who get to watch it on Prime are getting a great deal., so I recommend it, Prime or not.  Caveat emptor, though:  depending on your mind set, you may be among those offended by some of the content and the ending.  Don't say I didn't warn you!",1442102400,,1646,4.867383512544803

I don't have the expendable income to purchase copies of series I do want to watch, while lacking the ingenious prowess with the interweb to locate them for free. So I was left filling my crafting time with this. While I hoped and hoped it would get better it just never really did. It was like one of those horrible art projects in college where the professor picks the collaborative teams and the loudest, most molested member of the group with the help of the sex-crazed members of the group willing to do anything for a chance of poon, conceives what could be good but they're just too in need of some help to see through. And there you are hating everyone and having to present a pile of excrement you really had no control over. Basically I was second guessing many of the characters purposes and developments.

2147476,4,B0002YLC1U,"I found it to be darkly compelling by never revealing all it's cards. The opening has to be one of the most artful; creates the cirque ambiance and pulls the viewer in for more yet never satisfies (boy, there's an innuendo). Setting in the 30's dust bowl is genius; the viewer feels the heat dust sweat and despair as if just a sepia-toned image away, without nostalgia. The characters of Justin and his sister are absolutely creepy and Ben, fighting demons that may be gods, has to be one of film's epic tortured souls. I'm dismayed that HBO carried only two seasons and didn't renew; I believe it could have become a cult classic with a large and loyal following in the manner of ""Dark Towers"" in the 60's.",1440374400,,708,4.496124031007752
2147477,5,B0002YLC1U,I love this series.  The story is in constant motion and the magic is fun!  The number of sex scenes and nudity is not necessary to make this enjoyable though.  I would not recommend parents letting their teens watch it.  Way too explicit.,1440374400,,239,4.488372093023256

2147479,5,B0002YLC1U,I enjoyed each episode of both seasons 1 & 2. The characters & stories seemed to become a part of a different era with a story plot that kept me in suspense! The fight between good & evil for a government which is now in existence VS the small existence of man in a simple example of depression that exist in today's life as well or not? What did you get from it haha?,1440374400,,368,3.9864864864864864

2147544,5,B0002YLC1U,I took a chance and checked out this series based solely on it's strong cast. I was pleasantly surprised at how the plot blended the occult with early 20th century religion.

2147549,4,B0002YLC1U,"This show was pretty good, but seemed aimless at some points. Some characters disappeared for no reason too early. The show was only given two seasons and then cancelled, and ends on a 'cliffhanger' of sorts. Christianity and the apocalypse is the undertone of the show, which follows a man gifted with the power of healing (but at a price), who joins a traveling carnival. It also follows a priest with a mysterious past and gifted with powers of his own. Although it has religious undertones, it's more of a religious mysticism/fantasy theme. I am personally not into religious shows, but this one interested me enough. It's worth a watch if you are willing to watch it to an end with an unsatisfying ending (which was actually just an intended finale of the season, not the show, but as mentioned it was cancelled).",1439769600,2,818,4.7272727272727275

2147654,3,B0002YLC1U,"Good if not great. For those who loved the circus as children, it might be a disappointment. For those into the occult, the mysterious, and unusual things in general, it works. The real flaw is its lack of a defining character we can all get behind; Clancy Brown as the preacher is not that character. Still, worth watching on a rainy night, with popcorn.",1438819200,,355,4.5625

2147656,4,B0002YLC1U,"Interesting as all getout.  The Depression has never been portrayed so accurately in a movie before.  You can almost smell the unwashed bodies and feel the gritty Dust Bowl sand in your mouth. Nick Stahl is perfect as the hayseed country boy with hidden talents.  I wish this HBO series had lasted.  I just discovered it, even though it's nearly a decade old. The actor playing the midget was excellent and so were all the supporting carnivale cast members. Clancy Brown did yeoman service as the demonic minister, while Amy Madigan was perfect as his deceptively vicious and evil sister.  It was a weird story and had too much gratuitous sex and nudity to fill in time, but overall the series was in a category all its own, very imaginative.",1438560000,,742,4.676923076923077

2147710,1,B0002YLC1U,"Boring and slow paced. Has the usual stock Hollywood demeaning of Christians and Christianity. (The evil 'villain' is a Christian minister of course.)  Does not really go any where or achieve any kind of resolution. All the main characters are unrepentent murderers (Even the supposed good guys) The story also seems to present good and evil as equivalent, just opposite ends of the same pole. The heros are as indifferent cruel and souless as the villains and use the same unprincipiled brutal methods to achieve their goals. The people of the depression are presented as mindless sheep just being herded along when they are not drunk or prostituting their children. No one in this show ever seems to take a bath except for Adrienne Barbeau and that is only so she can flash her boobs in a scene that has no connection to the plot. The further into the series you get the more you start to wonder why you should care who wins the final confrontation. The ending (if you want to call it an ending) does not resolve anything because the evil preacher is brought back to life after the hero kills him. Also there are repeated references to atomic bomb testing but no one ever ties the references into the plot. If this review seems disjointed it is just mirroring the show itself. Unless you like being confused depressed and bored I would skip this drivel.",1438128000,,1355,4.669456066945607

2147985,5,B0002YLC1U,"Carnivale is an amazing, utterly engrossing, weekend devouring series which brings to sepia-tinted life the Dust Bowl era and populates it with fantastic, yet real and believable, characters.  That it was dropped after two seasons is a heartbreak in a world with approximately a gazillion cheesy, hyperdramatic law procedurals that just won't die.  Apparently our TV shows must be like our politics: repetitive, catchphrase filled pablum trumping anything resembling an intelligent story.",1435449600,,488,5.763888888888889

2148061,5,B0002YLC1U,I've only watched a couple of episodes so far but I like it - a lot. It's dark as well as intense at times. You never know what's going to happen next and things happen very suddenly and very unexpectedly. It offers what I find to be a gripping (fictional) look into what the lives of carnies might have been like back in the 30's. Well done. Good acting. I will definitely continue watching the series.,1434758400,,403,4.315789473684211

2148068,4,B0002YLC1U,"Unusual concept, I liked it very much. I did not give this 5 stars only because it bothered me that they were dirt-encrusted.

2148075,5,B0002YLC1U,"I am sorely disappointed that there will be only two seasons of this excellently written story.  Carnivale gives us a new perspective on the battle of ""Good vs Evil"" in which we are taken on a journey where we are never quite sure who is ""Good"" and who is ""Evil"" until the middle of the second season. What a pleasant surprise that awaits the viewers when you realize that, unlike most serials and TV series, we are not given the answers to each episode's mysteries by the end of the hour, but rather each episode gives a little bit more of the puzzle, yet never quite enough and it left me thirsting for the next airing.

Bravo to all those who worked to create this wonderful story.",1434412800,,684,4.377952755905512

2148188,5,B0002YLC1U,"I loved this series so much, I added it to my highly elite personal collection! I have since watched both season one and two of ""Carnivale"" atleast three or four times each! This story is so engrossing, you will never forget it and never want it to end!
  The writing is so rich and vivid, every character so multi-layered ~ like a good book you can't put down and stay up all night reading just to see what happens next! From the very first scene in season one's first episode to the very last scene in season two's final episode, this series grips you with mystery, history, and the bizarre, as well as an exceptionally well drawn collage of characters with their own secrets to tell. I especially enjoy the spiritual side of this intriguing story that keeps you guessing what these seemingly ordinary people are truly capable of, and just who is truly good and truly evil.
  ""Carnivale"" deserved multiple awards for writing and acting. The ENTIRE CAST gave exceptional performances, which is so rare!
If you haven't watched it, you are missing out!!! I only wish they brought this series back!!!",1433462400,,1098,4.6735751295336785

2148355,5,B0002YLC1U,"Much like with Boardwalk Empire (which I started watching because it starred Steve Buschemi) I began watching this show for Michael J. Anderson (the backwards talking dwarf in ""Fire Walk With Me"") and Adrienne Barbeau (well, she's Adrianne Barbeau!) and was very pleasantly surprised.  This takes place in the ""dust bowl"" area of the America southwest during the Depression, and one detail I really like is that a lot of people, particularly the main protagonist Ben Hawkins, are always dirty, which is quite realistic.  There is a rich tapestry of characters, which, like Boardwalk Empire, took me a few episodes to get down, knowing all their names and quirks.

This is a show that starts you off with a rather large question mark, then slowly reveals the answer.  We have two separate stories that eventually begin to come together, until we realize the dichotomy between Ben and another character, Brother Justin (who is one of my favorites on the show.)  The finale of this season was a fantastic cliff hanger and compelled me to begin watching Season 2.

I would highly recommend this show to anyone who likes great acting, clever dialogue, and wonderful camera work.",1431561600,,1173,4.959183673469388

Rumor had it HBO needed money to keep funding the Sopranos so they cancelled Carnivale. Carnivale has some of the most deep and dynamic characters I have ever seen in a tv show. I think Lost would be a super close second. There were so many layers in the story, and plot line that just kept you wanting more. I think canceling this show was the worse thing HBO ever did.

I recenttly watched it a second time feeling nostalgic I guess. And I still seen signs and symbols I missed initially. A show that can do that in my book is destined for greatness. Unfortunately Carnivale didn't make it past season 2.",1430956800,,771,4.244897959183674

2148405,5,B0002YLC1U,"An intriguing show that keeps you looking forward to the next episode. If you like American Horror Story, you'll like Carnivale. Grab a bag of popcorn, launch Amazon Video and get ready to be taken on a journey across the southwest U.S. as good and evil prepares for battle.

The show's creator originally planned for a 6 yr story arc, but HBO unfortunately cancelled it after 2 seasons, despite its winning of multiple awards. This was blamed solely on the production expense.  Even with the premature cancellation that leaves you wanting more, the first segment of the story arc is (thankfully) completed at the end of season 2. For details of what was planned for the final 4 seasons, google, ""5 reasons Carnivale should be revived on Netflix"". Note: the article has spoilers.",1430784000,,779,4.849624060150376

I usually keep away from Carny films but the Carnival in this Depression Era, didn't creep me out- then I realized all this apocalyptic weirdness going on in this series, and was soon caught up in all the stories wrapped up in this show. Each time I watch it - from the first second of every show - I have to wonder about this world and what has been and what will be - even if it IS fictional. I liked it so much, I bought Season 2 both streaming and on disc. The acting is great, the special effects and whole premise (weird as I find it) are all fantastic to me. It includes actors we've all known and new ones as well - all doing a great job. Since my streaming is a nightmare due to whichever reason the tech or Customer Service rep gives me - I just bought both seasons on disc and may edit this Review further at a later date. This is one show I have to watch every second of, including the same beginning of each show- of tarot cards and flickers of odd times in our world history.",1430784000,,1069,4.047169811320755

Each  generation apparently has avatars of good and evil who must meet to save or destroy the world. They get closer and closer to each other, they share the same nightmares, and grow more and more powerful.  Unfortunately the series only lasted two years, so some questions will probably never be answered.

I watched the series when it was on HBO all those many years ago. The other great show back then  was ""Deadwood,"" which also left everyone wanting answers when it was struck down in the prime of its run.  At least you can find these great shows on line to stream.",1430611200,,675,4.575

Adrienne Barbeau, whom I had not seen in a long time, is really great in a small meaty role here.

As I am watching the initial episode,  it appears that a traveling carnival is evolving into a type of self supporting and tight knit society of social misfits or rejected persons who are just trying to survive the harsh times. While watching,  I am transported back to those times and can almost feel the poverty and taste the dry dust. I can't help but want the best for the characters as they struggle.

The story is fascinating and will grab you, you will think about the characters even when you're not watching the show, and would wait in anticipation for the next episode.

Like many HBO shows, this one too is definitely a show for ""binge watching"" :)",1428710400,,469,4.441860465116279

None of the characters have any chemistry, and all the conversations seem forced. The most interesting thing about this show is the intro.

It's definitely not for children or teenagers in my opinion. There is almost full body nudity is some scenes and there's plenty of very colorful language. Some words I haven't heard in a few decades.

2148801,2,B0002YLC1U,"Terrible acting!!  And yes if we were conversing I would yell that statement.  I can't stress this enough.  Maybe I just expect more out of an HBO production, but between the little person that plays Samson the circus leader and the terrible ""mystical"" cheeeeesy ass voice used to represent Management I could barely stomach watching this crap.  I felt like I accidentally turned on the SyFi channel on cable.  The plot thickens slower than a clinically anorexic model.  The first season completely fails to ever provide any of those ""I need to see what happens next"" moments that I have come to expect at some point during a first season of an HBO production.  The last episode finally provides such a moment, however by that time I was already so frustrated with the dullness of the rest of the season that it was too little too late.  I guess I'll just have to wait for the next season of the Leftovers, or True Detectives, or G.O.T.

Well, not exactly like all of us. There is always something that puts them on the fringes of society. We are generally uncomfortable people who don't measure up to our expectations. Carnivals are one place they seek refuge. The story takes place during the thirties. The Great Depression and the great dust bowl have taken their toll on everyone. Carnivals become a place to escape the misery of daily life. The story follows one such operation - Carnivale. There is another story interwoven here of two immigrant children from Russia and how they made their way in this country. They became involved in that other geat refuge - religion. More specifically, a form of the Protestant religion. And that is the background of what emerges as a supernatural battle between good and evil. Mystic powers are in evidence, but not overly so. It's all quite believable - mostly. Compared to several other shows that mine similar story lines, this one is well done, well acted, well directed and well written. The opening grates on me because it feels just a little too close to another venture into the supernatural - Haven. Haven is less well written, acted and directed. All that aside, I intend to watch every episode until this series eventually dissappears, or jumps the shark.",1425081600,3,1426,4.777327935222672

I'm typically not interested in shows with unexplainable sci-fi features, but with the ""old carnivale"" theme, helps makes it very believable.  We powered through 2 seasons in two weeks through Amazon Prime and was disappointed that the show did get canceled after two seasons.  Unlike some canceled shows, the majority of the unanswered questions are resolved in the last episodes; however, they did leave it open for a potential season extension, which did not happen.  I would strongly recommend this show for adult viewing only.",1424390400,,705,5.267857142857143

2148995,5,B0002YLC1U,"There is ample evidence that we are presently inhabiting a golden age of television production. I have just completed episode 12, season 2 of Carnivle. Clearly, the series is only establishing itself at this point. The primary quality metrics I employ are (1) how much do I think about the program when I'm not watching it? (2) How high has it moved up on my list of free-time priorities? and (3) How much do I care about the characters and how events develop? On these three metrics, Carnivle ranks as (1) a constant daily companion in my thoughts; (2) the most important thing I do in my free time; and (3) introducing me to characters I am only starting to know, want to stay with much longer, and get to know much, much better. May I add that something magical must have happened at this programs auditions? Every character/actor match was inspired. I know that the characterization unique has frequently been applied to this series, and it is an appropriate choice. I can think of no other program that has (1) captured and developed the era of the dustbowl; (2) delved into the world of an itinerant, socially marginal subculture and brought it to life; (3) developed a unique (allegorical) mythology that says something authentic about our actual nature as humans; (4) left me thinking long afterwards about the themes explored by each episode; (5) so gloriously revelled in the magic and mystery of human differences and uniqueness; and, perhaps above all, (6) inspired me with regards to the importance and possibly lasting significance of the moral and spiritual struggles of daily life. If I were to fall into a small fortune tomorrow, I would consider using it to develop Carnivles seasons 3-6, as had originally been planned for this series. Bring it back? Carnivle still lives. Somewhere out there, it is real, even now. Id sure like to bring it back to the screen.",1420848000,11,1879,4.7846153846153845

The characters develop over time and nothing is simply given to the viewer. It's a story to savor over time, exciting as it unravels, and fun to ponder as it does.

A few years ago, I read a book called ""Water For Elephants"" that was set in a carnival in and around that time period, and while it did not have the supernatural elements that Carnivale has, the book was a fascinating look at a lifestyle and a time in U.S. history that I knew little about, and it left me wanting more on this subject.

(Another upside to having Amazon Prime- you can download the whole season!)  I love the way this show is shot- from the wardrobe to the dust storms, it definitely catches the struggle of the Depression- you can almost feel the dirt & dust in your shoes! Add in an escaped convict, a passion-filled preacher, and a traveling carnival...Then tack on a battle between good & evil for the fate of all mankind- you've got a reason to stay in and watch TV! ;) The reason it's only three stars is because the plot is complicated, quite unnecessarily in a lot of cases; also I feel like the story sort of plods along when they could have moved on to other issues.

2149108,5,B0002YLC1U,"I finally got around to watching this series as it came available on Amazon's Prime Instant Video. The description of the story caught my attention as I was also watching ""American Horror Story - Freak Show"". I'm not here to compare the two series but it's hard not too.

""Carnivale"", in a nutshell, was an amazing experience. The storytelling, the depth of character and the cast nailed it! Clancy Brown, whom I first seen on screen in ""Highlander"" is a remarkable actor and plays the part of Brother Justin in an incredible manner. Nick Stahl too brings alive Ben Hawkins and the remaining cast fills in any and all the holes to create the amazing world of ""Carnivale"".

The cinematography too is well done, giving the viewer the ""feel"" of the distressing time period.

HBO did cut the life of the series short due to viewer loss, which then leaves the audience wondering what would have been the next step in the evolution of the series. Though only 2 seasons became reality it is worth the time to watch the series. Is there any chance of a resurrection of the story to hit the screen? Probably not - but one always has hope.",1419552000,,1129,4.551724137931035

2149149,5,B0002YLC1U,"Good versus evil is always entrancing.  Here, as usual the Bible is completely trashed, but despite that is proven valid.  I don't think the producers meant to trash or prove it valid, but the series succeeds in begging the question well.  Quintessential good-is-evil theme of Bible is well represented in this series:  a dysfunctional kid with a healing gift and an evil preacher with good intentions, each paired off for eventual STAND against each other, with a lot of supernatural stuff in between, all encased in a tawdry carni or revival package.  Great stuff.

When I first saw the series 10 years ago I wrote up a webpage on it (will put the link in the comments, since I can't do that here), but the series triggered all that material, wasn't intending it.  Point is, the series makes you think about the big questions:  why are we here, and if our lives have some BIG meaning as so preoccupied the Greeks and Romans of old.. then what is that meaning?  Or is this some tired cosmic joke, that we keep on wondering about a larger purpose of our existence?

The atheist will tell you that we hallucinate the supernatural, life after death, etc.  But they can't account for how their vaunted EVOLUTION.. began.  Only the middle, and that darkly, do they account.  Which leaves everyone with the question ABOUT the meaning of life, still in the dark.  Religion tries to fill that void, and does a horribly incompetent job of providing answers.

Which leaves you with bewilderment, and looking at the stars.  So this series helps you navigate the bewilderment, offering no answers but begging the question.

First class acting by all parties.  Very brutal and hard to watch, set in the Depression, when Spiritism, Aimee Semple McPherson, and all manner of trickster Christianity was rampant.  But really all the religious ideas were rampantly bad, everyone desperate to explain or gain money from someone else who wanted an explanation.  Humanity at its worst, and best, but as always, in the dark.  Under, some looming yet undefined larger epic battle between some unseen 'good' and 'evil' puppet masters...",1419033600,,2113,4.862745098039215

I get the impression that the series was planning to stick around longer but the plug was pulled and they just ended it.  Many, many unresolved issues, things that were emphasized were just let drop. Things were added that had no connection to anything else. Just really poorly written, no continuity, no explanation of highlighted actions.  Just really bas.

2149265,4,B0002YLC1U,"If you liked ""Twin Peaks"" (not counting the last season!), you will like ""Carnivale"". Very Lynch-esque;  the cast even includes Michael J. Anderson, the dancing little person in T.P.). Carnivale has the added benefit of very effective cinematography.  Well-chosen cast, including entertaining cameos by notorious bad-boy Robert Knepper (Samuel in ""Heroes""; Frank Sinatra in ""My Way"") and well-known John Savage (who can appear either benevolent and kind or evil and sinister, even in the same episode.)

The ever-present tans and browns emphasize the dusty, dry lives of quiet desperation people lived in the thirties in the southwest.  Makeup and costuming are both well done; people really were continually dusty and dirty, and their clothes obviously rarely washed.

Like a good dark novel, you will have trouble watching only one episode.  I'm grateful for streaming access...",1417478400,,880,5.481481481481482

I was still pretty confused about what was going on by the end of season 1 but season 2 really brings it all together.

It is sloooooooow moving and the parts that are interesting and conducive to the story are few and far between.  I gave it a whole series hoping it would get better, but it never did. There were glimmers of hope to keep it going, but the primary story lines were over shadowed by boring, unrelated dialogue and unnecessary sex scenes.

2149415,4,B0002YLC1U,"The title opener on Carnivale, juxtaposing tarot-type cards with footage from the Great Depression, is excellent. The general idea of this show is a battle between hidden spiritual forces at the root of the hard times of the 1930s. I loved the opener for the first show, where ""Samson"", who ""manages"" the carnival troupe (really there is a hidden ""management"" which calls the shots), gives a brief narration about how once a sense of wonder had been present in the world, until banished by ""Trinity"" (which seems to mean the making of the atomic bomb). Fine acting throughout, except for the hidden ""management"" behind the curtain scenes which ought to have been better. (Instead those scenes are at the level of a Saturday morning cartoon show.) Also the Father Justin character, although the actor portraying the sinister radio priest does a great job, is unfair to the real radio priest of the 1930s, Rev. Charles Coughlin, who was not ""possessed by a demon"" but did say some good things. (For some reason, there is a routinely biased anti-Coughlin depiction of the radio priest of the 1930s.) For these quibbles I do not give Carnivale all 5 stars. Nonetheless this series is overall excellent and recommended.",1415491200,,1214,4.926829268292683

Starting off with a young refugee from a farm destroyed by the 'dust bowl' being saved - or possibly kidnapped - by a nomadic band of carnival freaks who all seem to have something to hide, the story shanghai's the viewer along with this strange youth (Stahl), who also seems to be hiding something. We ride along with him on his bumpy mystical journey as he discovers the key role he must play in a violent battle between the powerful magical forces of good and evil. The characters are quirky, tragic and endearing. The dialogue and conflicts are suspenseful, and the plot is solid, accomplishing a satisfyingly heartwarming conclusion without being too corny.

2149453,3,B0002YLC1U,"Some strong acting performances for the suspect script; just too much reliance on ""nightmare/dream devices."" But, in defense of the writing challenges to make a weird storyline work, some gimmicks just might be unavoidable. And at what point in pop culture, will the entertainment media stop feeling the need to constantly hammer religious people with negativity? I think most adults have an opinion about what rings true and what does not, give the poor bastards a break. Slimey politicians make a much more challenging target!",1415059200,,528,5.223529411764706

2149563,5,B0002YLC1U,I've enjoyed the series immensely. Being an HBO series you expect some violence and sexual situations so that was within expected tolerance. The story line is good and a perfect escape from everyday life. As I'm nearing the end if the second season I'm sad to see it ending but also glad they aren't dragging it out. Clancy Brown is excellent in his role.,1413849600,,355,4.5625

No big top. The theme is good vs evil.  The good .personified as the young boy from the dust bowl who joins them on the road. Evil is a bad preacher who is the Usher for the devil.
The setting is the Midwest from Texas to Montana and the photography is wonderful.
some of the best characters are the coochie dancers, management,
the whole show is run by Samson, a little person.  This actor is great.",1413676800,,569,4.451923076923077

The incessant dirt that is just a part of the life of everyone living through the dust bowl era.  You'll feel like you need a shower after every episode!  The religious and occult aspects are interesting but display the usual jaded hypocrytical religiosity that you would expect from Hollywood.  Watching in the middle of the second season and Ben, the ""saviour"" is only slightly better than the villian.  No danger of any true piety or a holy, virtuious hero emerging here.  Well written and acted, nonetheless.",1413158400,,599,4.94

2149648,3,B0002YLC1U,"Beautifully staged and shot. That ""feel like you're there"" vibe in spades, sometimes to an uncomfortable level.  Extremely well performed by actors who were chosen not just for their chops but because they look like people who could have plausibly been carneys during the American Depression.  Falls short on story, both depth of content and momentum.  Most episodes tease the main theme then devolve into awkward and tedious set-pieces that explore mundane interpersonal conflicts.  It becomes obvious pretty quickly that the creator really wasn't sure where he was going.  This show has much more in common with Heroes (flashy entry and then not much to say) than it does with Lost, which is the gold standard for the eternal good v. evil battle genre.",1412380800,,754,5.048387096774194

The sets are excellently portrayed giving it a real feel for the times and the traveling carnivale spot on as the entertainment of the period. The plot drifts between harsh reality and a netherworld with magical/spiritual powers befitting the grifter nature of the characters, A variety of characters populate the traveling show, all strongly acted, and focused on a young man with special powers who effects the carnivale as well as the towns people they entertain.

Season 3 could have been fascinating. It seems like the fast paced, technology driven society that we live in today, has created an attention deficit mindset. Thus a show like ""Carnivale"" which takes time to develop, but has a much deeper meaning, is not really appreciated anymore.

2149731,4,B0002YLC1U,"This show held my attention from the get-go due to the characters, setting (in time, place, and vehicle), and the pace.  You know fairly early on that 'something evil is lurking', and with that being the main subject matter, the entire series is quite dark, promoting that premise.  The characters, well casted and well acted, are the constant threads that run through the entire show, and they are developed nicely, which adds to the overall interest - you know, some regular people (well, not quite) dealing with that evil factor.
  So, if you enjoy dark and eerie with some horror thrown in there, a good story line that requires some attention = watch it!!",1411257600,,660,4.7631578947368425
2149732,4,B0002YLC1U,"Interesting, at times slowly developing, multiple story lines.  It was difficult for me to stop watching, although I was hard pressed to decide if I liked it or not. The overall story arch is about the war between good and evil, with a young man with healing powers representing good, and a Methodist minister representing evil.  The two stories, the developing evil and the developing good avatars, are shown in each episode, with the life of the carnival people intertwining with the two stories.  And then there is the mysterious Henry Scudder, who appears in the life of so many people,and in visions, but is he evil?  Is he good? What is he?  Season One asks many questions, with few answers.  Hopefully the answers will start coming in Season 2.  Season one ends on a cliff hanger, so be prepared to want to start season 2 right away.",1411257600,,840,4.635135135135135

I almost would watch another episode but I hated the preacher's character and the non-forgiving evil nature of the mother of the protagonist.  What a waste of a potentially great story.  I love Steampunk and that period of time in America. I enjoyed the concept of a traveling carnival of gifted people perceived as ""freaks""(earning another star). The writers could capture the imagination of the contemporary audience by focusing on the contrast between organic good/evil and machine good/evil instead of the worn out religion vs.magic. There was no empathy for anyone, just suspicion, lack of trust, manipulated by a thin thread of hope that the boy will find his place in a rotting world.",1410393600,,867,4.877551020408164

2149845,5,B0002YLC1U,I find it really griping. It's one of those shows you don't totally understand what's going on a first but you have to keep watching and as you keep watching you get these little hints as to what's going on. But so far anyway they haven't straight up explained what it is and I like that. They assume the audience has a brain. It's definitely for a more mature crowd due  to some nude scenes .

Dissapointing in how the show went into detail on points which didn't move the story.

Really bummed that there is no Season 3, HBO should have held on to this and kept it going, all it needed was more Marketing. I have never seen it advertised anywhere, it just caught my attention as I was scrolling through Amazon Prime shows to watch and I thought it looked interesting. I want to add that I really liked that the dialogue they used was actually the sayings from back then, there was apparently a lot of research done so puzzled as to why they didn't market this better.

Meanwhile out in California a minister and his spinster sister appear to be all about serving the meek, but what really motivates them?  Viewers won't find that out this season either.

Carnivale would be the exception to this suspension of belief and my tolerance for drivel throughout the episodes and seasons.  I got through the first five episodes and I felt a moral obligation to myself to quit.  I am so done trying to like even one character or find one redeeming quality.  After much thought and soul-searching, the only character I like even one iota is the mother who cannot talk, or move on her own, or eat, or . . . etc.  By the way, how does this mother exist?  Even I know that you cannot ""spoon feed"" gruel to a person supposedly in a vegetative state -- she'd choke on it in a few seconds.  How many times am I forced to witness the Ben Hawkins character wandering around scared out of his mind about some dumb thing or another, or better yet -- having a nightmare?  So, what I really wish is that I could get back the five hours I spent watching these episodes, and I feel like the aforementioned mother character -- numb and unable to relate to the world.  Don't waste your life or time on this one.  I have a whopping headache from watching this unfathomable ""series"".

2149977,3,B0002YLC1U,"I watched both seasons, and it's better than the dreck served up week after week on TV, but not a whole lot better.  Like many of these long-arc series, this one would have been a LOT better kept short -- there's enough story here for two seasons, maybe three, no more.  I read at IMDb that the producer intended to run it for six seasons -- way, way too long for material this thin.  I would probably watch more if it had been produced, but half-way through the second season, I just wanted them to get it over with already.

The whole thing, stem to stern, has been done before, many times.  Good vs. evil plodding inexorably toward an apocalyptic showdown; the reluctant but hunky messiah; the megalomaniac bad guy (hugely overacted by Clancy Brown; I kept waiting for him to shout, ""There can be only one!""); mystical mumbo jumbo and a secret society (Templars, this time); a big juicy cast of colorful and (mostly) interesting characters; and of course the requisite number of astonishing revelations about who's related to whom (""Luke, I am your father!"").  The whole thing feels like one of those enormous Stephen King novels -- pretty good, but you wish it were about half as long.

The unique thing about this series -- and the only reason to watch it, in my opinion -- is the carnival setting.  I don't think there's ever been an ongoing show about a traveling carnival, and that made it fun.  Sadly, though, they filmed the entire thing in the same 3 or 4 locations, so Oklahoma looks exactly like Texas and Nebraska and California.  I can also confidently affirm that I have now seen enough overweight strippers to last me the rest of my life.

Bottom line:  HBO made the right call in cancelling it.  It's much better than than the idiotic slop TV throws at us week after week, but it's nowhere near the standard set by the best HBO series.  If there were one more season and that wrapped it up, I'd watch it.  But four more seasons, as planned?  No thanks, I'll stop now.",1408406400,3,1985,4.518207282913165
2149978,5,B0002YLC1U,"Honest review: it's a shame HBO canceled this series, if it was released today, the show never would have been canceled. The creators used the first season to develop the characters and establish the antagonist, protagonist and the overall conflict/through-line of the series. Thus causing the first season to seem slow, ultimately leading to a compelling end of a first season which begins the overall call to adventure between the protagonists and antagonist, which is the most compelling aspect of the series. Bringing me to Season Two which is by far better than season one, and this humble reviewer feels the show never really had a chance to begin with and was canceled after the first season received mixed reviews. If the show allowed season two to receive its reviews before pulling the plug, I have a difficult time believing this show would ever have been canceled. Especially in present day when everyone desperately is seeking a compelling series to become lost within. This series probably could have been wrapped up in just one more season ie a season three.  I'm just hoping with enough positive reviews Netflix or Amazon will pick up this show for a final season three if HBO doesn't. They would get tons of new subscribers just to see the conclusion of this awesome series.  Just one more season to wrap the series up and do it justice would be appreciated by all of its fans and would prove the series a hit in preset day viewers mindsets. Especially since most people won't even watch season one or two since they know the series doesn't conclude. However, on the other hand, if they knew this series concluded, many more viewers would join in and become a fan of the awesome unique series, Carnivale.",1408406400,,1721,4.7912457912457915

2149986,3,B0002YLC1U,"Nice period effects and the ambience promises great things.  The process drags a bit, however, and the lead character loses some credibility in that for someone with supernatural power/abilities he's forever getting sucker punched by circumstance.  The season begins to pick up toward the end, although there are so many subplots and loose ends it's difficult to focus on the main theme.

HBO seems to favor rambling story lines in their series...""Deadwood"" was infamous for loose ends...and it can work if the writers are adept at weaving the plot back together often enough to hold the viewers' interest. The Sopranos worked well; Deadwood not so much; Boardwalk Empire excellent.

The jury is still out on how well Carivale compares as we enter Season 2.",1408406400,,757,5.080645161290323

The sideshows shown in Carnivale were still around when I was a boy in the 60's in rural areas and I intend to show clips of this to my grown children who think I make stuff up. The characters are well played and put a human face  on sideshow players. Sometimes the plot moves a little slowly,but you will find yourself compelled to want to know what happens next. Like it or not;the sideshows were what put the excitement,mystery and raciness into the old country fairs.

It's a classic tale of Good vrs Evil, but throughout the first season who is which is not made a simple thing.  There is much gray and misdirection.  Set during the Depression in Oklahoma and Texas, the circus part of the show is gritty and paints a picture of the tough times and do-anything for a buck reality.  There is a huge supernatural component to the show that also feeds the reluctant hero angle.  We're rolling right into Season Two, clearly captured by the story and characters.

With that out of the way....

When you talk about 5 star TV series you talk about shows like The Wire, Rome, The Office, Friday Night Lights, Spartacus Season 1 & 2, Breaking Bad and Deadwood. Carnival is in no no NO way close to even being in the ball park of entertainment as those just mentioned. How people are giving this show 5 stars is beyond me but for the sake of the reader lets break the show down point by point.

#1 Story: I'm now 7 episodes in a total of 7 to 7 1/2 hours of watching and I still have absolutely no Idea what the purpose of anything in the show is. There is no defined struggle, no defined antagonist or protagonist no love interest, no strong character development no nothing. Just 3 main characters a midget, a douche bag and a priest all doing wierd magical stuff at random.

#2 Picture Quality: This show is very low budget for an HBO series and its shows. Camera work lighting and cast all look lackluster in comparison to other modern shows.

#3 Acting: The acting wouldn't be so bad If the midget wasn't such a bad actor. Its as if his tone and facial expressions are are always the same under every circumstance. To make things even worse he's a main character and consumes around 1/3 of the screen time. Just brings down the entire production.

#4 Story Flow: The show constantly takes you through long drawn out completely irrelevant moments. Enough said

In closing any show that can go 7 episodes without establishing anything of purpose Is a horrible show. What a let down, feel like I truly wasted my time",1407974400,3,1775,4.376899696048632

Unfortunately due to the untimely demise of this series there are a lot of questions that go unanswered. The writing and acting by all was really good and really sucks you in while at the same time leaves you scratching your head.

The good guys have their shawdow sides and the evil have their salient points.  It's like a battle of the angels where Michael, the Archangel had to destroy the fallen in order to help save mankind, but was mankind truly saved?  It all boils down to each person having  free will to decide between good and evil, tested over a lifetime, sometimes making good choices, other times not.  In the end, like in the series,  good is stronger, but it's still a choice. Can't believe there was not a third season, at least to tie up loose ends.

The story is BEHIND the story.  Rather wish I had taken that extra English Lit class so I would know what I'm talking about.  There is probably a name for this, but all I can come up with is (?)

The pacing is slow compared to contemporary shows, but it's genuinely creepy in parts; I found myself actually shivering at the end of several episodes. Some of the plot twists are predictable, while others are out of the blue. But the characters are well-drawn, complicated, and engaging, especially Samson, the actor from ""Twin Peaks"" who runs the carnival under the direction of the mysterious ""Management."" Nick Stahl as the lead is not a character I personally like, and though you'd think you need to empathize with the protagonist to enjoy a series, the fact that he's challenging makes Carnivale more provocative. Be warned -- the show is incredibly gory and graphic in parts, on par with NBC's recent series ""Hannibal."" There's also an interesting back story -- the show's creator, Daniel Knauf, had a father who was disabled and this gave him insight into individuals who were outsiders such as the ""freaks"" of the carnival. This series won't appeal to everybody, but for the right viewer with the right sensibilities, this is a worthwhile investment of time.",1406505600,,1126,5.059139784946237

The story line is slow to present itself, giving the viewer time to get to know the characters and their idiocinracies. Which they are all rich in. The acting, in my opinion, is brilliant. The filming is very good with great sets. The whole thing with good vs evil, is  challenging in Carnival. One's not sure who's who in the beginning episodes. And the good seem to be evil, or maybe at times, the good need to be  evil to destroy evil. I just finished season 1.

It's very suspenseful and even in its supernatural theme, it has the real life human struggle of good and evil that people can relate to.  Often it made me realize things about myself I didn't know were there.  You never know what you will or won't do until you're actually in a situation.

I was amazed by the efforts of that community to get the series continued after it was cancelled, leaving major cliffhangers. I hadn't watched an episode since then, so watching it on PRIME is fun, especially when there is not much else on TV that appeals to me this summer. Watching it without an  entire week in between episodes makes it a little easier to follow, although I had forgotten just how - um - otherworldly some of the plot lines are. Great acting by all the cast, many of whom went on to other TV ventures. Makes me wonder what happened to Nick Stahl, though, in the last 10 years.

2150298,5,B0002YLC1U,"Carnivale is set in the Depression. You get a good look at how people dressed, what they had for possesions, etc. The characters are well developed and your interest is kept in following what happens to them. There is definitely a good versus evil plot here. Sometimes, this type of series turns into a soap opera, but this does not. My rating for the rating would be for Mature audiences due to the nude scenes and the demonic scenes. Not for children.

It was canceled after two seasons. The last episode was well done and not a big ""tease"" to hook you for the next season. No Sopranos ending here.",1405468800,,600,4.454545454545454

Some of the characters are interesting. Lots of supernatural occurrences and unexplained forces at work within the community.

There's also some fairly steamy sex scenes which add zero to the plot and to the characterization. That's become omnipresent in American made flicks, as if the audience won't accept anything that doesn't give them a little skin!

2150423,3,B0002YLC1U,Couldn't figure out what was going on. There were such good reviews that instead of turning it off after one episode I watched the whole season. Decided to jump to the last episode and see if this thing ever managed to get a story together. The last episode was just more of the same. Not much in the way of character building.

The young man who has ""special powers"" is a misuse of the powers that all of us have if called upon by circumstances.  The writers of this series have a lot of things wrong.  It is interesting up to a point but truth and reality gets clobbered up with Satanic ritualistic powers.  Life is much more straight-forward than this Carnivale bunch of clowns.  The idea that ""Management"" calls the shots is again Satanic and absurd.  The little midget guy who calls the shots on a day-to-day basis is cute and he is the best actor of the lot.  I did not watch the series to the end because it got too far out and absurd.  Life is more of a ""karma"" thing than a witchcraft tarot reading sort of thing.  You reap what you sew and if you sew a lot of crap in your life you'll get the same back.  If you sew a lot of gratitude and love you'll get that back too.

2150497,5,B0002YLC1U,I just started watching the pilot as well as the first few episodes and I must say that it captures your attention. The show takes place in the dust bowl era and it does a great job of capturing the era. The show is not for kids thou due to some violence and nudity and occasional foul language use.  I recommend for adults only.,1403827200,,329,4.140625

2150499,2,B0002YLC1U,"this is not the kind of show it appeals to me.  I think the chronological time its not there.  I guess the props are hard to find, but for me if you really wanna do something that happened in the past do a good research, instead of being lame, and lazy totally misleading the viewers that some of the things shown in some of the episodes really happen in real life.  Sucks! but then again this is only my opinion.  If the other viewers like enough to give it a five starts good for them",1403740800,,486,4.08421052631579

2150504,4,B0002YLC1U,"Fascinating, gothic-style series about a traveling carnival during the Depression. Those who enjoy David Lynch (Twin Peaks) or Stephen King (The Stand) will  discover  similarities and echoes that shouldn't diminish the experience. It's a shame it wasn't picked up for a third season, since loose ends abound. Creepy, spooky, thoughtful fun.",1403740800,,341,5.666666666666667
2150505,4,B0002YLC1U,"What I liked:
The writing is solid (as expected of an HBO show). As strange as it sounds, the lack of profanity compared to shows like Deadwood was a plus.
The later part of Ben's plot (once he becomes conflicted over his ability and whether he should use it) was a strong point, as the character development of his earlier story connects very well with it.
The other main plot revolving around Brother Justin and whether he is good or evil, and why these supernatural elements are appearing in his life, was much more compelling than the plot surrounding the Carnivale and was often the most intriguing part of the season.
I enjoyed the casting of the show, especially the two main actors Nick Stahl and Clancy Brown.

What I disliked:
At the onset, I was excited for the supernatural elements, the touted ""Good vs. Evil"" themes, and how they would combine with the mystique of the 'carnival'. Unfortunately, this didn't appear as much as I had hoped, with only some of the plot being focused on cryptic foreshadowing, and the rest spent on the marital issues between the head showgirl and her husband.
One of my other gripes is the lack of development for many of the characters. Many of the 'freaks' of the carnival are included in the backdrops of when shows are put on, I felt they should have been brought forward to add their story and make the cast feel larger.
The pacing felt a bit slow, though that could just be because the writers were expecting six seasons, not two, for the show.",1403740800,,1494,4.574626865671642
2150506,5,B0002YLC1U,"If you like battle's between evil and good with demons thrown in, then this show is for you. An added bonus is the show takes place during the Depression. I always wanted to see the two seasons and I just finished Season 1. I loved it!",1403740800,,235,4.130434782608695
2150507,5,B0002YLC1U,I would recommend this series to anyone who is interested in the impact of the Depression.  The scenes of the Dust Bowl are very accurate.  (I lived a long time in a similar place).  The people's hopelessness and their struggle to survive are well documented.  I do need to warm people about the scenes with the Kooch dancers.  Too graphic for me!!!  Otherwise I was very pleased with the series.,1403740800,,396,4.585714285714285

Seemed near the edge of what I don't like, the harshness and less pretty sides of life.  Life was harsh during the Great Depression, the Carnival people seemed almost to thrive in their own struggling hand to mouth kind of way.  Or maybe their way of life was the traveling kind that could and would just move on, when it is time, when others would just stay and wait and hope for things to improve.  Anyway, I liked it a lot.  Not loved it.  I would not watch it again. No point, message was clear.  Loved the two different tent cultures...interesting vision here.",1403568000,,675,4.267716535433071

But the real fun is the supporting cast of performers, outcasts or freaks....you decide.

2150530,4,B0002YLC1U,Carnivale obviously did not click with HBO viewers as it did not survive more than a couple of seasons. The concept is interesting though and extremely well executed.

The thought and detail that went into to this story, building the characters and the sets, not to mention the story line, made me feel like I was a fly on the wall.  I always suspected that kind of life would be hard, even sleazy but I had no idea how bad it could get.

I never did get to finish it and could barely remember anything about it, other than it peaked my interest back then enough to remember the title.  While I wouldn't recommend this show to someone 15/16-ish due to some of the graphic content/language, it's still an intriguing show.  There are some really great characters, plenty of suspense and mystery, and the historical references tying into the characters are fantastic.  Unfortunately, this show was never fully realized since HBO discontinued it in the early 2000's.  If you like good vs evil magic and a little 1930's ""Ripleys Believe or Not"" creepiness, then this show is for you.",1403308800,,698,4.931623931623932

I actually enjoyed watching the blending and development of each character, except for the ""unlikely hero"" Nick Stahl, as Ben Hawkins, the Oklahoma farm boy.
My top 4 favorite characters were Michael Anderson, Clea DuVall, Clancy Brown, and Amy Madigan ... all balancing the great mystery of Good versus Evil.
My least favorite character was Nick ""Go To Hell"" Stahl, as Ben Hawkins ... who appeared to me to be struggling as an Actor in defining and owning his Character. At times, he appears almost ashamed to be playing the role of an Okie, at other times he just simply failed to really bring anything ""Interesting, or Shocking, or Riveting"" to the Ben Hawkins role.
Even at his strongest light, all he could muster was his infamous lame line ... 'go to hell' ... and Cut!
There was also a feeling of Nick being 'over-shadowed' by other strong members of the cast ... seems like he was the Wrong choice and fit for this role. And there seemed to also exist a deeper element of self-punishment by always appearing 'out-of-sorts', like obtuse, always dirty, filthy, and smelling like rotten bologna ... Nice touch, Nick!
Can't wait for the next season ... without Nick of course!",1403308800,,1443,4.707509881422925

There's something about the general flavor of the show that I can't easily describe that makes it unique.  Perhaps it's all of the dust...  It's kind of like Steinbeck meets Game of Thrones.  The only complaint is they didn't make more.  (Hint hint Amazon... I'm sure you could find a great following if you could pick it up and make a few more seasons...),1403136000,,492,4.34065934065934

So why did I rate this 5 stars? Oh, and why do I watch every episode? I fell in love with the characters, that's why! I look forward to the interactions, and I love the dialogues. Every scene with Samson in it is pure gold. The protagonist, Ben, is a intriguing character. I did not like him at first. because of his paper thin dialogue. But, as Ben develops into his own character, he becomes more and more likable, and you really start  to hope he comes to his own.

The scenes containing Brother Justin, our antagonist, are some of the best. They are sprinkled in just enough to keep you interested. The development of our antagonist feels as if he could be the alternate protagonist, up until a certain point.

Even the romance scenes are interesting. There are so many love triangles, that it might as well be geometry.

2150587,5,B0002YLC1U,There are only two seasons to Carnivale but they are good ones. This is a show you need to watch to follow the story line and not just have on in the background. It's the basic good vs. evil plot filmed in the dust bowl setting of poverty. Grays and browns with pops of color and a the supernatural which makes the evil much more scary. The only sad part is that there was a great setup for a season three but it was cancelled. I still think about the series and all the possibilities.,1402790400,,485,4.11578947368421

The cast of characters is a great mix of the odd, off-center and down right strange people that we sometimes associate with carnivals and circuses.  Each character has a story to be told that slowly reveals itself during each episode.  Granted, the story line is beyond reality, but I was drawn in because of the interplay between characters and the mystery that surrounds the story line.

The remarkable part of the show is how well it passed my marathon test.  Every single piece came together, made sense, and did not leave me wanting to shake sense into a character, though Sophie came close. Usually seeing several episodes back to back will point out the weaknesses in plot and character development.  This held up through both seasons.  It's only flaw was that it was cancelled after 2 seasons.  Makes me wonder what the heck they use to determine whether a show goes on or not.

It's too bad that HBO insists on clinging to old fashioned business models. It's great that their old shows are here on Amazon now though. They should work out a deal and continue or wrap up this show as an Amazon exclusive. Anyone who ever watched it would join Prime just for that I'm sure.

Carnivale is dark, twisted, and mysterious. It's characters are rich and fascinating. The production and acting are superb. It can be a bit slow at times with soap opera like moments but the mystery makes up for it.

This series, (I've seen about half of Season 1), does depict this atmosphere very well, thus my 3 stars.  But the plot goes too deep into supernatural, (i.e. religious), realms for my tastes and detracts from the reality of the period circumstances.  Not to say that peculiar negative beliefs and practices didn't exist then, or now, for that matter.  However, relationships and genuine humanitarianism also existed which was the true story of healing and survival for those living in hard times and, so far, this series seems to slight those elements in favor of the occult.

This carnival is down on its luck, during the depression, but you come to understand that although the folks have a very tough life, they take care of each other and understand things that are not of this world and know that nothing that happens is an accident, there is always purpose.

Beautiful production set during the Great Depression in the middle of the Dust Bowl. Metaphors,anyone?  The good vs evil plot is too complex to reveal but even if you can't follow it, just look at the show - it is an artistic mix of religion, suspense, and sex, all housed in a run-down freak show. There is a ton of info online about the show so I won't say much more except it is a five-star weird fantasy, irreverent enough to keep you alert, literate enough to appeal to the thinking viewer who likes a bearded lady now and then. Don't google too much or you will miss the fun of the plot as it slowly unfolds. Definite 5 stars from me! Reminds me of the good old weird series, Twin Peaks, except it is a better quality fantasy and less self-conscious. (Don't miss the lobster-girl.)",1402099200,,961,4.491428571428571

I guess this is the reason it captives you mind.  The characters are dark and mysterious.  My favorite character is Samson and whoever is Management.  I just think the episodes seem to drag.  However it clearly makes you move onto the next episode.  The other mystery is the correlation of the preacher and Hawkins  So many questions with more suspense to follow.

My dad and his brothers and brother-in-laws, cousins, unks etc formed a tank building crew, worked from our base in Texas as far as Canada North of Montreal.

The carnival life, the Great Depression, Dust Bowl, et al, are most interesting and certainly well covered, the actors/characters are top notch, but the mystery of it all - and it is indeed a mystery - was intense with clue upon clue being presented and left without answers. Good v. Evil leaves a splotchy trail, as does this review. The series is dark, fascinating, and I do recommend it for a dark stormy night's viewing, but expect to be left behind as the story unfolds.",1401926400,,587,4.6

Soon the troupe cross paths with Brother Justin Crowe (voice man and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Highlander-The-Source/dp/B001F71GQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Highlander: The Source</a>&nbsp;co-star Clancy Brown) and his spinster sister Iris (Amy Madigan).  Ben and Brother Justin have something in common but are divided by being polar opposites of a problem.  Each represents good and bad, heaven and hell, God and Satan respectively.

Season One was the better of the two seasons overall.  Yet it left you yearning for more.  While Season Two was good and answered the questions, the storyline was very hard to follow at times.",1401926400,2,916,6.0

It is very well done in that I am constantly looking for the little things, clues to what is actually developing in the story.  The set is very authentic and the dialogue realistic (for a sci-fi) series.

There is a little bit of the supernatural in the story--and you are left guessing each week about which characters are actually good and which ones might be evil.

Could not understand why more demonic processed individuals  were not incorporated into Justin's crusade like the Usher.  There are too many variables that need further elaboration.

When I saw that the show was now being streamed through Prime, I had to go back and watch. I'm 7 episodes into the 1st season, and can't wait to watch the next one.

I wish this show had not been cancelled after 2 seasons. Many complained that the show moves slowly, but it's very interesting, makes you think as a viewer, and is far from boring at all. If you haven't watched any of this show, it's one that I would recommend. Episodes run in the neighborhood of 45-50 minutes. You'll find all the characters very intriguing, you'll love some, and hate others. But I do think this is much better than most of the series we see on TV today.",1401494400,,784,4.297297297297297

We just finished watching Season 2 and were so sorry that the series had no closure for its audience.

Nothing happens except me getting a migraine from trying so hard to care about a single character in this series when it is seemingly impossible because as far as I am concerned they should all be put out of my misery. And then you watch Season 2 and wish that it could have gone on for at least 3 more seasons.  Season 2 makes up for almost everything I found lacking in Season One.

I am a supernatural, strange, eerie story fan and a history buff so when I found out this epic tale of good vs. evil was set in the depression dust bowl days, I got excited. I was not prepared for the highly skilled set design, clothing, writing and acting I encountered. Wow! As soon as I got 30 minutes into the fist show I said, ""I have to own this!""

Unfortunately, the program only lasted two seasons. Ratings dropped. HBO wanted to cut the budget. The producer refused to cooperate. HBO gave him the opportunity to wrap up the story with a two-hour finale at the end of season 2. He refused to cooperate.  HBO pulled the plug. It was a sad day for a lot of fans including this one who came along after the dust settled, and fell in love with what was left over.

There have been rumors online about a resurrection of the show, a possible movie deal, and even a possible graphic novel series as the producer had a LOT more story to tell when they shut him down. Thus far, nothing has emerged which is sad. All we have left are these two seasons, and they are worth watching. I highly recommend them.

2150754,4,B0002YLC1U,"I am not sure what to call this. It's not your typical series that wraps up everything episode by episode. It's more like a blend between mini-series and soap opera. It goes in dramatic places like a soap opera, but unlike a soap opera, it has a fantasy, metaphysical or religious slant to it. It's really dark, but then the Depression was dark. The series makes great use of dust and dirt. Everything has a look of worn hopelessness about it. It's easy to get wrapped up in how it all looks (obviously).

As far as the story goes, even though the characters are carnies and misfits, the writers do a good job of bringing out the human elements so that viewers have something to connect to (while standing back wide-eyed and saying, ""WTH?"") Don't expect the stories to make sense. I gave up trying after the first few episodes. It's so slow that you'd think I'd be able to keep up. You might ask, ""Why watch a slow, boring show that you don't even understand?"" I wondered about that myself. It's weirdly intriguing. Now that I've seen the whole thing, I think there was no other way to do it except with all the long, drawn out shots. It sets the tone and props up the action.

Anyway, it's not like anything else you've ever seen before so it may put you in this weird place of thinking, ""What was that?"" Go with it. If you like suspense, it's worth the ride. I suspect it is the kind of show that grows with repeated watchings.",1391385600,,1429,4.368421052631579
2150755,4,B0002YLC1U,"This product arrived quickly and undamaged.

As for the series itself.  It is a vey good series that makes you feel for the characters.  Furthermore, you can relate to many of these characters and the way they act just on the bases of time period the story alone.  There is strong religious aspects that are significantly twisted and thus anyone who might be offended by such should avoid this series.  In addition, there is ""a lot"" of nudity, sexually content/terminology, and occasional swearing which is unfortunatebut again, a bit realistic for the time and situations the characters exist in.  We understand why nudity was added, but feel it could have been cleaned up a bit, thus the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  Those aspects were most likely dirtied up just for HBO's purposes.  However, the story is interesting and enjoyable to watch.  Especially without commercials on this DVD set. This is the first of only two seasons released.  The second second is just as good on every level.  It is a shame HBO cancelled the series.  However, it is easy to goggle this topic and you can find Daniel Knauf's (series creator) vision of how he wanted to end the series and discover what characters should have developed into.  We are not sure if the website we are listing will ever change, but as of now the website presenting this concluding information is: [...]

As mentioned, this series does have nudity, sexually content/terminology, and swearing, so we do not recommend it to anyone that can be offended by such.  However, if you can look past all of that, the story does present an interesting chain of events that dwells into the historically accurate struggle of humanity during the times of the dust bowl and mythical aspects of how there is always a battle between good (the light) and evil (the dark).

2150757,5,B0002YLC1U,"I bought both the first and second seasons of Carnivale in 2007 and have never regretted it.  I've watched it at least once a year since then, all through.  This is such a rich, beautiful, and engrossing program.  I can't remember how I learned about it - I never have had premium television channels - but this is one of the few TV series that I've purchased without first seeing, and without regret.  I love the color, the fashion, the plot, the era, and even the wretched lives of these magnificent characters - so much.  It is completely gorgeous and who can't like a story of good vs. evil?  Especially when ""good"" and ""evil"" have been owned by wholly human characters and rarified to black and white on a sepia backdrop.
My favorite things in the Carnivale series are: the period - the Great Depression set in the Dust Bowl (look it up for an important lesson in American climatological history); the color, or lack thereof; the Dreifuss family, especially Stumpy and his wife Rita Sue; Samson - the oracle-by-proxy; Jonesy- the pure soul; and Iris and her brother, the larger than life Brother Justin (Clancy Brown, in what has to be nothing other than a career enhancing role).  So many characters - so rich a tapestry.

I don't regret that there aren't more seasons of Carnivale in the same way I don't regret that Breaking Bad ended.  I consider myself the biggest BB fan, but BB had to end and it was completed with an elegance that I wish more shows could accomplish.  If Carnivale didn't have the backing, the story, and the writing necessary, then I'm glad it ended before damage was done.  I always am sad when the last episode on the last DVD of Carnivale is over.  Very, very sad.

I couldn't help see the parellels and repition of our nations history unfolding before my eyes, as an extreme right enslaved the poor and improverished the middle class into a surreal existence.

Just because our Grandma's old photographs of the thirties are faded to sepia tones, doesn't mean everything then was really brown.  Colors were just as vivid as they are now.

People bought new things and made new clothes.  On Sunday morning, or Saturday night, most people took baths and put on clean, starched and ironed clothes.  Women wore pretty dresses in bright colors.  Prostitutes especially, wore bright if cheap dresses.  Everyone's photo albums, books, and decorations were likely to be brand new looking, not like they were bought in an antique store in 2010.

No matter how dirty your job, everyone washed his face and hands before sitting down to eat.

Stating something silly, ""The sun vanquished the Trinity,"" for example, isn't deep just because it's couched in Biblical language.

People didn't use the same slang we use now.  Girls were ""pretty,"" not, ""hot."" Catatonic people weren't referred to as, ""turnips.""

The Christian minister character as a hypocrite or just plain evil person is as old as ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and as common as all the ""Elmer Gantry"" clones.  By now it's just boring and completely predictable.

2150782,4,B0002YLC1U,"""Carnivale"" opened the screen for ""Heroes"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" redux (and Ronald Moore was even involved in it). It put the possibility of using history as a metaphor. . . if it's only a metaphor . . . of good and evil into play. It was also the first HBO series to not give out all of its answers at the end of a season, to refuse to ""close"" with any explanations. Originally, the audience wasn't there, partly because it aired fortnightly, and that's a mighty long wait between episodes that are this interlocked. The box set is perfect.

There are few extras included. There is nothing to explain why Nick Stahl acts so much like a brat in season 1, for example. However, the series lived in its other characters, in Clea Duvall and in the cootchie act family. Seeing it again after six years has made me appreciate it again.",1371168000,,835,4.493421052631579

It takes place during the Dust Bowl, and revolves around the lives of carnival members and a Methodist preacher's life. The cinematography is beautiful, and the actors are wonderful.  The main character is Ben (played by Nick Stahl), whom the carnival picks up after his mother's death.  He has the power to heal things, which the carnival members discover early on, and try to exploit. There are many other notable characters, all of whose lives you will become deeply involved in.

After the 3rd or 4th episode, it got less interesting and repetitive. And then it just seemed like the writers started depending on sex and violence to carry the show through. Someone said the 2nd season was 'way better than the 1st, which I can't understand. The 2nd season seemed horrible to me...getting more like a horror film then anything else....but we were hooked! Just watched the last 3 episodes last night and it's a great relief to be done with it. My brother and his wife only made it through about 6 episodes....i think if you like main-stream TV you may like this, but if you're a little more high-faluting you'd better stay away.....24 hours down the drain! if you haven't seen it yet I would recommend you investigate the 4400 instead.

Anyway, an interesting show with an interesting cast and an interesting concept.  Extremely entertaining.  I little bit of language and some brief nudity, but not as bad as many other shows on premium channels.

As long as you understand that this is an incomplete series (supposed to have been a trilogy, but was cancelled after the 2nd season) going in you won't be disappointed.",1325635200,2,567,4.63
2150833,5,B0002YLC1U,"There have been many shows that I have loved that have been cancelled prematurely, but the one that hurts the most is Carnivale. With only two seasons of a planned six finished, I feel Carnivale had the most promise and most wasted potential. There's a real interesting story and mythology set up here that, had it been allowed to finish, could have been something special.

Should you still check out the series? Definitely. But you'll be cursing the executives once its over.

Admittedly, it's not too hard to see why people didn't flock to the show. For one thing, it's almost impossible to sell. How does one describe it in the least amount of words? ""A tale of good and evil set in the backdrop of the Great Depression"" is the best I can come up with, but that's pretty vague. And even if you get them to watch it, the show is pretty slow at first and esoteric. This is really a show that requires patience, but it pays back in spades.

What's the show about? It's about two different people in different parts of America. One is Ben Hawkins, a chain gang refugee who is picked up by a traveling carnival. The other is Brother Justin Crowe, a Methodist preacher. Both men exhibit strange supernatural abilities; Ben is able to heal others, whereas Justin is able to bend people to his will and force them to confront their greatest sins. One of them is the Child of Light, the other the Child of Darkness, and the fate of the world will ultimately be decided by them. Even that description doesn't do it justice. There's a lot going on here with both storylines with numerous characters and interweaving subplots. Everyone here gives a great performance, but the one that steals the show is Clancy Brown as Brother Justin. He's easily one of the most charismatic and fascinating characters on television, and his arc is at times more satisfying than the 'a-plot'.

One thing that makes the show stand out is that it's clear a lot of thought was put beforehand into preparing the show's mythology. There's a dream sequence that takes place in a diner in the second episode, for example, that will likely have you scratching your head the first time you see it. On rewatching the series, you'll know the exact significance of what's going on. There are a lot of series that make stuff up as they go along and by the end of the series they're tripping over themselves trying to put everything together, so Carnivale is impressive in that its main arc is clearly planned out.

I really can't say enough--the directing, writing, performances and overall production values are perfect.

The DVDs themselves are pretty good. I'd love to see the show in high definition at one point, but the picture and sound are both perfect given the format's limitations. Each disc is given two episodes so you know they're not skimping out on the quality. The features, on the other hand, are a bit sparse. We have three commentaries--the first two are for the first two episodes, the last one is for the tenth. The first one is actually quite interesting as we learn about the genesis of the show (it was originally planned to be a movie but got too big). The other two commentaries are a bit 'meh', in part because I feel that they could have picked more eventful episodes. In particular, it would have been nice to have one for the finale. The featurette is standard EPK fluff but it works well enough.

Despite its cancellation, the show is a must-see and worth your time.",1324598400,3,3461,4.608766233766234

The first few episodes are slow and you are left wondering what it is all about, but as you push on you begin to see where it is heading. There is constant reference to biblical narrative and much symbolism but the prophecy is clear, at some point there will be a confrontation.
The two main characters Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin, struggle with the revelation of their true calling, one with the ability to help the other to harm, Ben and brother Justin are trying to fight against their destiny, until the last episode when they finally begin to give in.

It becomes clear early on that the healer is of light and the priest is of darkness, but they surround themselves with an array of characters with slefish and sacrifical motives and that confuses this clear picture. What remains certain is that these two men are destined to be enemies.

Can't say enough good things about the acting, especially Clancy Brown. That man was born for this role. His prophetic and frightful sermons are legendary. Truly.

You will not be disappointed with this series if you can handle a little bit of magic and wonder. Don't worry, this is not a fairy tale hobbit story, this is about real human suffering and story of those who try to overcome it.",1316476800,,1097,4.649484536082475

2150841,5,B0002YLC1U,"Set during the Great Depression, Carnivale is an enormously ambitious work of the imagination integrating a detailed and meticulously-realized vision of life in rural, dust-bowl depression America with a mythos that is in some ways as ambitious as Tolkien's. It won five Emmy awards and was nominated for a further ten.

A fusion of history and mystery, Carnivale's themes and action derive from a struggle between good and evil personified by the story's protagonist, Ben, and antagonist, Brother Justin, that is reflected in the world at large; a world which, as the story begins, we are told sees mankind on the verge of substituting wonder for reason and it is here that the story's ambition can be said to have gone one step too far.

Had Carnivale been a novel, it might have survived and prospered. Readers become committed to seeing books through to the end, while television series depend on audience numbers for a story to be produced to its conclusion and this is the reason Carnivale lasted only two seasons out its planned six-season run: audiences in television drag writing down towards a lowest common denominator that mires us in shows like '24' and `The Mentalist'.

Carnivale was a show for the rest of us that featured ideas and events that broke new ground in imaginative  television writing; creating a comprehensive mythology where ghost towns swallow the living and add them to their ranks; where blind sorcerers swill absinthe and foretell the future; and where one woman's life is so mystically woven into the fabric of the world that her orgasms bring on the rain.

This and many other things make Carnivale's writing brilliantly imaginative but causing one Amazon reviewer to make an unfavorable comparison to the BBC's production of Robert Grave's wonderful novel, ""I, Claudius."" That comparison doesn't take into account I, Claudius's life as a television series being midwifed by the work of a supremely-talented novelist who had classical histories as source material; while the the writers of Carnivale flew solo as they wove historical research into a sweeping, savage architecture of the plausible and the fantastic. In a sense, this could be said to have been Carnivale's downfall: it was too good for its own good.

Despite award-winning vision, the writers of Carnivale, trusted too much in the Audience; depending on them to sift an intricate unfolding of events, some of which were tied to other events that took place decades in the past, and it was simply too much to absorb and too subtle for an audience whose members could grab the remote and drool over the chaotic implausibility of Lost.

Carnivale like its sister show, Deadwood, was brilliant, beautifully-shot, innovative television where writers fused history with mythology to create a show that was like nothing else that had come before it and if, unlike many members of today's television audience, you have the attention span necessary to follow a comic book, you may love it as much as its fans do.",1300492800,8,3005,5.022088353413655
2150842,3,B0002YLC1U,"There are many interesting aspects to Carnivale, which intrigued me when I first watched it. The setting - a traveling carnival show during the Depression - is unusual and original. The characters are varied and interesting, they look and act like real people, and they seem to have a rich life that goes beyond the requirements of their story. All excellent, and it made a great first impression on me. But as the show developed, I became increasingly frustrated with the extremely slow pace. People have praised the show for taking its time, but after a few episodes it starts to feel more like stalling for time. Various mysteries are set up, but then the show treads water - it's not just taking its time, but feels like it's afraid to reveal anything in case the feeble explanation disappoints us. The same beats are played out repeatedly - Sofie continually breaking off in the middle of her clients' Tarot readings, or storming away from her mother, Ben's tormented looks as he avoids using his powers, the evil Lodz trying to influence Ben... At a gentle pace, there's enough story for perhaps three episodes, but instead it's dragged out over twelve. And a tone which, at first, feels gritty starts to feel positively morose. Everyone suffers, nobody laughs, nobody changes - it's the Depression at its most depressing. After a while, the cynical part of me started to suspect that the producers were stretching things out not for any reasons of high art, but in order to get paid for a long-running series rather than a short-running one.

It is interesting to compare Carnivale to a real classic, such as I, Claudius. Here you have a legitimate example of a brilliantly written miniseries with tremendously rich and complex characters, and a sprawling, fascinating story - that took its time with story, but it had a clear destination and wasn't afraid to make things happen, and a great deal did. Carnivale puts on the swagger of a ""great"" series, but it isn't one, and, wouldn't have become one if it had run twenty seasons instead of being humanely euthanized at two.",1300147200,6,2081,4.796657381615599

2150854,5,B0002YLC1U,"Sometimes you see something pass you buy and its just a mirage. Other times you see something and its a miracle in the works. The only thing with miracles is that sometimes, when you close enough, you notice they have a price. and the miracles in this show seem to have a really steep one.

Carnivale begins in the middle of the Dust Bowl, with an old home about to be torn down. A son sits with his mother and says he can ease her pain but, strangely, she calls him the spawn of the Devil and says she'd rather die. She does, too, and after the son sees her buried he also sees something that he can't quite make out - in some ways it seems like an opprotunity and in others it seems like another way to find his time wasted. Regardless, he knows he has nothing to lose and gears up for what becomes a weird and wild ride through the middle of the nothing, encountering blackened miracles and false prophets on his way to something more.
Its really an interesting story.

As far as everything goes, the story does develop slowly and, sometimes, you feel as though you are bbeing left out of something. There are other times when that same piece comes back and brings you into the fold, noting exactly why something happened and exactly how it fits in. The thing that keeps this from hurting the story is good acting and little oddities that seem to plague this place, from a girl who tells fortunes through the voice of a mother only she can hear to even strange variations of odd.
That's what drew me in - the places they stop, the ways things move; everything revolves and evolves until it it becomes the thing you want and more.

for the cost of the product, you really have nothing to lose. You also have another season to go through as well and, when the two meet, all sorts of visions seem to mnaifest. A lot of other people have better comments on this but I can only give you want I think and I think this was done well. From the clothing and the set-up of the time to the people that are utilized and the weird things that seem to be happening, everything works in your favor.

However, the story line is rich with a mix of good, evil, magic, visions, intrigue, and mystery that are delivered in such a way as to make the abnormal seem normal. After watching an episode you are left wondering what things occurred in the episode that might be clues to the past or future events. It is definitely not your normal series. HBO does it again - gives us something original. I've only watched 3 episodes, yet I imagine the story will hold up for at least this first season.

2150856,5,B0002YLC1U,"There are a small number of TV shows I've seen that have approached true greatness. Two of them, Carnivale and Firefly unfortunately didn't get the chance to fulfill their entire vision. The one show that did, The Wire, did have a full five seasons to tell the entire story. Another show, Lost, although very good, didn't quite measure up to greatness in the end.

I just finished watching both seasons of Carnivale and I can definitely say that the experience was like reading a deep, involved, mysterious novel where the story enfolds at a perfect pace and builds to a satisfying end place. The development of characters is one of the highlights of this show. The characters appear genuine despite the supernatural elements, they are numerous enough and fully developed over the series to keep you interested in all of them, and their interactions are complex and critical to the story. The look and feel of this show is also genuine for the time period with dust storms, dirty fingernails and carnival creepies. Underlying this is a story of epic proportions; the historic battle of good and evil, supernatural powers and mystical beings (avatars). Put it all together and this is one excellent show.

Despite the fact that this series was cut short (it was planned for six seasons), the conclusion is still meaningful and satisfying. Yes. It leaves you wanting more because by the end of season 2, you get it. You understand how awesome this show really is. Oh what could have been!! Why is it that the TV Exec's don't have the patience to let greatness blossom? Let the visionaries (in this case the show's creator, Daniel Knauf) tell the whole story they want to tell.

2150859,5,B0002YLC1U,"First off, a warning if you haven't seen the whole series yet - wait until you watch the whole series before listening to the director/writer commentary on episode 1 of season 1.  Unfortunately they seem to assume everyone has done this, and let loose with a couple of big spoilers even within the first 15 minutes (at which point I turned it off since I've only made it 2/3 through season 1 so far, and what they said was complete news to me!).  They really should've put a warning at the beginning of the commentary that they would be trigger-happy with the spoilers, that they were going to be talking in a ""series-specific"" context and not an ""episode-specific"" context.

I've seen the first 8 out of 12 eps of season 1, and so far I rate this 5 out of 5.  Exceptional writing, acting, directing.  They capture amazingly the world of traveling carnivals out west during the dust bowl / great depression.  Really interesting, well-rounded characters.  If you're frustrated by drawn-out story arcs and plot lines though, a la Lost, this series may not be for you.  Myself, I love the involving mythology and the pacing works perfectly for me.

2150872,5,B0002YLC1U,"The first thing that drew me into this series was the setting; the 1930's dustbowl in the American Midwest.  The second things was the vehicle of a carnival.  The third thing was the 'tag' about the time period being the last age of magic.  I was not prepared, however, for the mythic scope of the story and the depth of background created by the writers for characters and plot. This series is 'mythic' in the sense that it attempts to tell-again the story of antique, cosmic themes (specifically the struggle of 'light' and 'dark;' 'good' and 'evil'), yet brings them to manifest narrative form on a unique stage; with characters drawn from rural Americana; gritty and full of moral and existential ambiguities.

This is the first of two seasons that were completed before the show was cancelled.  Without giving anything away, I can say that the story is intruiguing, well-written, full of salient revelations and considerations, and deeply satisfying.  The end of the second season completes one ""arc"" in the original six-season plot-line the writers had worked out.  As such, it doesn't leave you hanging; rather, it leaves you at a fecund juncture in the story, having resolved enough to satisfy, while portending much more to come (which you can imagine for yourself, as the show was cancelled).

2150873,5,B0002YLC1U,"Unlike most series, this one doesn't start out slow and boring, it catches your attention beginning with the very first episode. I had to do a project for a college class where we watched a show without the sound on, to try and figure out what was occurring via the nonverbal communication used. Then we were to view it again, but with the sound, to see how well we caught on to what was happening. I wanted to use something I had never seen before, and had been meaning to watch the series for over a year. I can't believe I put it off for as long as I did... Of course, I used episode one of season one for the project, and after watching it, I had to finish season one off within the week, then immediately moved on to season two. If I wasn't working full time, going to school, and watching my kids on my days off, I would have just plunked myself down in front of the tv right then and there, and watched them all straight through without budging for anything. Now that says a lot for me. I have a very large genre spread for what I like viewing, but the only other series I have ever liked enough to sit down and watch back to back are Firefly and Wonderfalls. Unfortunately, HBO cut Carnivale off before it was truly finished. They answered many questions with what they did in the two seasons that were produced, but there is still enough to go on that they could make an awesome movie to wrap up all the loose ends and not end up beating a dead horse like so many series go on to doing. I totally understand the fact that they wanted to end on a high note and not run the series into the ground by dragging it out when they have run out of new content ideas, so lets hope they decide to hit the big screen with the final moments of Clayton Jones, Sofie, Ben Hawkins, and all the other unique souls that make up the Carnivale.

2150877,5,B0002YLC1U,"I think I would have to give this series 5 stars solely for the stunning credits sequence, the most gorgeous I have ever seen. As the haunting theme music plays, the camera zooms into extreme closeups of a series of tarot cards and we see hidden within their depths scenes of the simultaneous devastation and progress of the 1930's. A dancing couple turns into a pair of angels. A card that shows Hell also depicts men standing in the breadlines. The Tower card has Capitol Hill in the background. The credits sequence is a fitting visual metaphor for this show that combines starkly realistic depictions of the horrors of the Depression and the Dust Bowl with surrealism, the supernatural, and apocalyptic prophecy.

Some complain that the series moves too slowly and not much happens in the first season, which is admittedly a legitimate complaint. However, I was so caught up in the gorgeous atmosphere and the intricacies of the characters' relationships that I didn't mind the slow pacing and lack of explanation. The characters, even the more minor ones, are complex and sympathetic, and the acting is uniformly excellent. I love the cinematography, the composition of the scenes--see the opening, slow-motion convoy scene in ""Tipton"", the diner dream sequence in ""After the Ball is Over"", and the creepy shots of the ghost town in ""Babylon"" and ""Pick a Number"". I highly recommend Carnivale for fans of surrealism and the supernatural; complex, ensemble pieces; and 20th century American history.",1197244800,3,1503,5.060483870967742
2150878,5,B0002YLC1U,"There are no simple words for what this show is about or how amazing it truly is.  It is remarkable in its complexity of plot, dialogue, and scenery.  They recreated the 1920s dustbowl for this show, and did an incredible job at it.  The overall storyline starts out simple enough, and honestly seemed like it could have been ended in one season.  Seemed until they started to show you the bigger picture.  The opening lines from the carnivals second in command, and public face, Samson, gives you the set up for the overall plot.  Each twist and turn of said plot makes you want to know more.  It is an unending search for truth, and the end to the war between light and dark.  Its like Samson says, ""To each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of dark.""  The two creatures are two people who you would never expect to be which one they are.  The first season is about the two trying to find their way, and understand what it is they are meant for and accepting that.  The second season is more about the build to the battle.  So the first season can seem a tad slow at times, but it will keep your interest.  The second season, however, is where the show hits its real stride and gets right into the sense of urgency and action that a truly well written drama can give.  Of course it isn't a ton of action, this is not a show that is supposed to be action packed.  The show is supposed to be a drama with a lot of dialogue and mystery, and that is what it is.  Even the most action filled scene of the two seasons is fairly tame compared to some other shows and movies.  But the way it is played out, and the build to it, makes it feel like a lot more.  The build up to the final scene of the first season is insane.  Trust me when I say that if you intend to watch this show, be prepared to devote an entire day to it.  After maybe the third episode, you'll be hooked.  This show grabs you and keeps a hold of you.  I still don't understand why HBO would ever cancel such an amazing show, and give a show like The Sopranos, that had clearly lost something to it by the last season, so many seasons when it obviously should have been finished before that.  I like The Sopranos, don't get me wrong, I just feel that it had come to its height long before the last season, and maybe should have been ended a bit sooner.  But here we have a show like Carnivale, that had two seasons, and clearly could have gone on at least another season and been well worth it.  The acting is superb, the writing is some of the best on TV, and the sets look like they are in the 1920s or 1930s dustbowl in the midwest.  There is a sense of dirt and poorness everywhere in this show, and makes you feel like the actors are really there.  So remember, if you intend to watch this show, buy both seasons, do yourself a favor, because you will want both after you watch the first season.  But be prepared for the second season to leave you hanging and wishing HBO wasn't so stupid as to cancel such a wonderful show.",1196812800,2,3013,4.166089965397924

The acting is top notch, not being hindered by finding the most beatiful actors to play the role, and instead only being able to chose the right actor for the job.  The story is excellent, and does not quite tell you who is good and bad from the start.  There are heartbreaking moments, with some laughter every once and a while.  However, I do acknowledge that this show is not for everyone.  There are some who will find it to weird, or sexual, and of course about a bunch of immoral carneys.

In a time of titanic sandstorms, vile plagues, drought and pistilence - signs of God's fury and harbingers of the Apocalypse - the final conflict between good and evil is about to begin. The battle will take place in the Heartland of an empire called America. And when it is over, man will forever trade away wonder for reason.

A sweeping epic that is both challenging and highly accessible, this one-hour HBO drama series focuses on the primordial conflict of good vs. evil, as played out against a pair of vivid and unusual backdrops: a traveling carnival working the American Dustbowl circuit, and an evangelical ministry in California.

I started with season one a couple of years ago, and could hardly wait for the DVD to come out to purchase; it finally did.

2150884,5,B0002YLC1U,"I don't have cable and only recently discovered this series when looking for some good dark fantasy. For dark fantasy video that began on the small screen within the last ten years (at least!), this is the mother lode. It has been a long time since anything this original and ambitious was made for television.

There is so much good dark fantasy in books and so little of it on the screen. Video fantasy tends to be simplified and dumbed down. This isn't.

One of the reasons networks are reluctant to try anything this rich and complicated is that so many viewers, accustomed to story arcs measured in double-digit minutes, bore easily. See some of the reviews of people who didn't care for the program. (Sesame Street, for all its virtues, has a lot to answer for in terms of what it has done to American attention spans.)

Yes, it does take a while to figure out what the heck is going on. Yes, it isn't instantly obvious who the good and bad guys are. And, yes, even after you do, it turns out that even angels, fallen or otherwise, have personal agendas that blur that nice, sharp dichotomy of Good and Evil.  Life, and good stories, are often messy and complicated and morally ambiguous.

If this were a very long dark fantasy novel or a series of novels -- with the last chapters ripped out by the publishing house version of the network idiots who cancelled the series after the second season-- it would read like a re-write of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath done by a collaboration between Ray Bradbury (Something Wicked This Way Comes) and Stephen King (The Stand) -- with more development of the female characters than either writer usually does. (Come on, guys, we buy more books than men do!).

2150885,1,B0002YLC1U,"Hi..

I can see why HBO pulled the plug on this awful show, I mean i really wanted to like it and enjoy it, but it was really bad and boring.

People keep saying how amazing and deep this show is, but i found the opposite, the show started very very slow and never picked up pace,at least in this first season, i mean really boring where nothing really happens and we are just left with some ridiculous subplots and never understanding the major plot.

I especially hated the scenes and segments of brother Justin, we as audience had to endure his boring repetitive speeches he gave in church ! and nothing important ever happens in his storylines.

I was waiting patiently for the so called Good vs Evil battle, but nothing of that sort ever happend, again i was just stuck with an endless plotless show, just poor cliched relationships and love triangles we saw in many many other shows.

On the positive side, the show had some good actors, good performances, but other actors where just terrible ( the bearded lady actress was awful so was the guy playing Lodz ).

The setting was the best part of the show, it was creepy and dark, and the scenes of the carnivale settings in the deserts were nice to watch, but that alone could not save this terrible show from sinking,

I never saw the 2nd season and i don't plan to, im not sure this show will get better in the 2nd season, but even if it does, im not planning to give it a try, i mean how good will it be having watched this awful slow first season,

My advice for people who haven't seen it, rent the first 2 dvds first before rushhing into buying it, because in my opinion this show is a complete failure, slow and boring.",1177027200,17,1682,4.334394904458598

2150888,5,B0002YLC1U,"""Carnivale"" offers one of the most splendid, gorgeous, gritty, sexy, disturbing, and original plot ever offered by a TV series.  Tremendously restrained, the series takes its time to tell its tale, but that only gives the viewer more time to fall in love or hate with the many varied and sordid souls whose paths intertwine.

Set in the glorious misery that was the Great Depression, ""Carnivale"" spins two distinct storylines that promise to meet one day in a furious clash.  The major storyline is of young Ben, an escaped convict who returns to his dust bowl home just in time for his mother to die and for his house to be demolished by bulldozer in a scene askew but derived from ""The Grapes of Wrath.""  Ben gets taken in by the Carnivale, a traveling circus of freaks, misfits, prostitutes, and rogues . . . not to mention the mysterious ""Management"" who is never seen but seems to know all.

Along the way, Ben must deal with a strange gift of healing . . . but each act of healing comes with a hefty price tag.  He meets various and sundry characters of the Carnivale, some of whom wish him good and others who wish him ill, and it's never really clear whose agenda is clear and whose is hidden.  Ben must also confront his past, his parentage, and the twisting hellish nightmares that plague his sleep.

The second story involves Brother Justin, a promising young Protestant minister.  At first, Brother Justin appears to be a paragon of what is good and noble in a churchman, but soon Justin becomes endowed with fantastic powers.  He tries to use them for good, but there is something . . . unsettling . . . about Brother Justin, and he finds himself sliding closer and closer to a version of himself that he does not recognize.

Building to a horrifying climax, Season One promises that the clash of good and evil is not yet imminent, but it is looming on the horizon.  Along the way, ""Carnivale"" introduces us to one of the most well-realized cast of individual characters ever seen in a single season of a TV show.

This is a voluptuous production, for all its dusty, windblown vistas.  Look for lots and lots of sex and quite a bit of blood and some very, very dark images.  Keep this one out of reach of the kiddies - despite its setting in a Carnivale, this ain't ""The Greatest Show On Earth,"" even though it is one heck of a show.",1171238400,4,2346,4.474178403755869

I never saw it new on HBO, but I have both seasons on DVD and I'm almos done with seson 2.  Season 1 is a bit like a big jigsaw puzzle.  You have an idea what the picture is, but you're never quite sure how one piece of information fits with the rest...But it makes it much more interesting because you can play along rather than have eveything handed to you.

This is a period piece during the 1930's depression period.  This has the look and feel like it was shot on location during those times....Right down to how most everyone looks really grubby because of the extreme drought in the midwest during he ""Dust Bowl"" period.

The cast basically look like every day people (Well except for the Freak Show characters).  You'll not find too many Bay Watch wanna bees here.  In fact most characters really appear like they really are just ordinary folk of that time.  HBO has had a great standard with so many of their series to create cass that look more like what you'd actually find rather than the model looking characters you find in soaps and many of the weekly series on commercial tv.

If you never seen it and like good writing, acting, and directing along with a very strange format, then this is something you'll want to see....As for strange...Well here's an example of ""Family Values.""  You meet a mother. father and two daughters who seem like any well adjusted family you might meet most anyplace.  They seem to care deeply for one and other and act basically like any other family....Except their business is the ""Hoochie"" show where Mom and the girls strip and dad is the barker who gets the guys in and uses keen salesmanship to get them to spend the little money they have.  He's also in charge of pimping mom and the girls out.  They all seem to pretty much look at it as a business like they were just an acting troupe or something.  The dynamics of that family relationship towards each other and their business is stranger than anything I've ever seen around the subject of prostitution.....And that's just one of the strange aspects of this series.....It's a damn shame it only went for two seasons....

One thing about getting to the end of season one....You have more than just a cliff hanger....You have many questions you want answered so you're pretty much compelled to get season 2.....And then the story really starts weave together.",1170547200,4,2475,4.553047404063205

2150899,5,B0002YLC1U,"Carnivale caught my interest two years ago when I saw a billboard for the show on the side of a bus. I had no idea what it was about, but the image (which appears on the cover) was intriguing to me. I've never had HBO and I'd never watched any shows from HBO, but a buddy of mine got me into Deadwood...I suddenly remembered this show and set out to check out the first season. I'm in awe. This is one of the most elaborate, entertaining, and great looking TV shows I've seen in a while; And the cast is amazing too. The show has already been compared to another one of my favorite shows Twin Peaks...That's not just because Michael J. Anderson (the backwards-talker from that show) is in this show. This show is very much like something by David Lynch. It's slow moving, elaborate, doesn't always make sense (although, in this case you have to wait for it all to pan out), has lots of naked women of course, and it's weird. It kind of makes me wonder what Twin Peaks would've been like, had it aired on something like HBO rather than basic cable stations. This show followed directly in the footsteps of Twin Peaks; It grew a legion of fans and was cancelled after it's second season. The amazing cast includes Clea Duvall ('21 Grams'), Carla Gallo ('Spanking the Monkey'), Patrick Bauchau (who plays the sinister mentalist/absinthe drinker Lodz), Debra Chrisofferson (Lila, The Bearded Lady), Robert Knepper (T-Bag on ""Prison Break"") and many more. Most of the characters combine to make interesting sub-plots, some that surpass the excitement of the Brother Justin-Ben Hawkins debacle. Anyway, to get to the story behind Carnivale.

In the Pilot episode Millfay, we meet Samson (Anderson) who tells us ""To each generation is born a creature of light and a creature of darkness""

and so the show begins. Samson's carnival rolling through the town of Milfay when they stumble on Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl, 'Sin City') a boy who has recently escaped from prison and is now burying his dead mother. As his house is demolished, he joins the carnival as a helper to get away. Needless to say, Ben Hawkins is the ""creature of light."" Waiting for him in California (which, since the show ended after the 2nd season; I doubt they reached it)is the ""creature of darkness"" Brother Justin (Clancy Brown, who played the menacing prison guard in ""The Shawshank Redemption""), a preacher with a crazy look in his eye who begins having visions that he believes are from God instructing him to preach to Migrant workers. While Justin is the main bad guy, his sister Iris (Amy Madigan) turns out to be a bit more sinister than you'd think  As one reviewer pointed out, even without the Ben Hawkins-Brother Justin story-line; This show is very interesting, just for the carnie-folk alone. For me to explain every plot detail and outline every character for you, would be pointless. You should go watch the show for yourself; I will give an overview of all the episodes and some non-revealing comments about them:

1. Milfay-A very cool pilot episode. The opening with Michael J. Anderson from Twin Peaks is great. The episode is interesting and opens a lot of doors for the following episodes. The episode is directed by Rodrigo Garcia ('Nine Lives')

2. After the Ball is Over-Better than the pilot and totally cool. The cinematography here is great; Really terrific. In this episode, Ben finds an important puzzle piece in his life. A lot more twists are added to an already complicated show.

3. Tipton-Another episode directed by Garcia, this one has the troupe setting up in

a town called Tipton. When they're asked to leave, they refashion the show as a religious revival with Ben headlining. It's a cool episode.

4. Black Blizzard-A blizzard hits the carnivale; Samson visits a hooker; Lodz tests Ben's powers; Brother Justin gets mad. A lot of things happen in this 45 minute episode; But it's all pretty good.

5. Babylon-The carnivale rolls into a town filled with some strange characters; A main character dies...One of my favorite episodes.

6. Pick a Number-This episode involves the characters getting revenge for what happened in the previous episode. Robert Knepper of Prison Break shows up in this episode.

7. The River-I found the Russian children creepy for some reason. The cinematography in this episode is a lot more colorful, but this isn't my favorite.

8. Lonnigan, Texas-In this episode (among other things, this is probably the longest episode at 57 minutes) Management is finally given a voice. I didn't think the voice of a female (I've known for a while that it's Linda Hunt) would live up to the expectations, because Management is very creepy as a silent presence. But the single line she says is very creepy. This is a marvelous episode.

9. Insomnia-This episode is, for the most part, just a way to stretch the season out. A couple important events occur, but it could've been scattered in another episode. I like it though.

10. Hot and Bothered-There's a whole lotta sex in this episode. But, besides that...This is one of my favorite episodes; The final shot is skillfully done.

11. Day of the Dead-Another main character dies. Sofia hears some stuff about Jonesy. The relationship between Justin and Iris gets weird...It's a damn good.

12. The Day That was the Day-A climactic end of the season. This is an awesome episode...Makes you not want to wait for the 2nd season.

There you have it. One of the most interesting shows I've seen in a while, if you're a fan of HBO (The Sopranos, Deadwood, Six Feet Under, Big Love)

you're not going to wanna miss this.

2150900,5,B0002YLC1U,"A fantastic series and it's a real shame that there is only two series of this wonderful show avbailable. Still, at least they are available as season two has now been recently released to buy. It's my favourite series by a long,long way and the presentation of the picture and sound quality on these discs do it total justice. Do yourself a favour, buy Carnivale, both series!",1154908800,2,377,4.641791044776119
2150901,5,B0002YLC1U,"I bought Season 1 in 2006 because I was bored. It was Summer and there was Nothing to see on TV. I had heard of the show-- but thought nothing of it. Then one hot summer night, I popped the disk one-- and now I'm captivated.

  On a limb, I would say that if you liked 'Firefly' because it did NOT follow the formula normally seen-- you will be enthralled by 'Carnivale' for the same reasons-- But I am not equating the two. They are too, too different. But they are similar in that Carnivale does not follow the normally expected script. It is uncomfortable, and embarrassingly 'naked' at times. At other times, you want to laugh, but the scene was ANYTHING but funny.

  Gothic, gritty, dark and turbid. The scenes and the people are so rumpled and sweatstained and threadbare, you begin to truly understand the pain the word 'Depression' meant. There's no parade of beautiful model-wanna-be actors mouthing lines to the usual formulaic 'Carnie/Outsider' horror/thriller script. The plain, dusty desperation of that era makes you ache. And that's masterpeice in and of itself.

  Something apocalyptic is biulding between the Preacher's ordeals and the multiply scarred people of Carnivale-- but the threads are so deeply woven they are hard to discern because of the invisible powers that seem to be walking alongside everyone.

The sense of something mystical and mysterious is just a deft touch at the edge of your awareness, never in front of you. Always tantalizing. ANd when you expect to be wowed with special effects and ala-kazam-- instead you are floored by a powerful script and electric acting.

  Even more intriguing is the fact that Both the Preacher and Ben have good intent. One wants to do good--and the other wants to be left alone. But one will be turned down a bad road and when it happens, even the the viewer will be squirming.

  Carnivale is great viewing for a hot, hot summer night. Have your Iced Tea ready. And be thankful that in real life, the dead stay dead.",1154217600,15,1992,4.730434782608696
2150902,5,B0002YLC1U,"This review will be short and sweet. Others have delved into each episode's deeper meaning, cinematography, or plot. And they have done so far better than I could have.

All I have to say is my wife and I just discovered this series -- apparently too late. HBO cancelled it for reasons I can't even begin to fathom.

We were hooked from the very first episode of Season One. With each subsequent episode we were drawn into the characters, the stories, the gritty-ness of carnival life. I've been watching TV for 40 years and I've never seen a series as well developed from the very first frame. The cast is astounding, some of the very best Hollywood has to offer. The stories are riveting.

We're only half-way through Season One, but I can tell you we'll buy Season Two when it's released. Then we'll suffer from carnivalous interruptus thanks to some crack-pipe lackey at HBO who didn't think a show this intelligent, well-crafted, and captivating deserved to live.

I hope people promptly cancelled their HBO subscriptions the day they discovered HBO cancelled Carnivale.

My recommendation is that you buy Carnivale Season One. It is unique in every sense of the word. A brilliant show that deserved a much longer run than it got.",1152144000,17,1235,4.779342723004695
2150903,5,B0002YLC1U,"I too, felt like season one left more questions unanswered-including new ones in the cliffhanger-than answered, but I absolutely was entranced by the imagery, storyline, acting and overall quality of the program. A+++++!  I would have given it 6 stars were I able to.

Season two's first ten minutes of Sampson's dialog answers many of the mysteries of season one, and sets the stage to once again open a new Pandora's box of twisting, turning, 'make-you-think-harder-than-a tv-show-has-in-years' storylines.

One of the critical comments left by a reviewer stated the story wasn't 'gothic.'  I beg to differ.  'Gothic' is about the only truely appropriate word for Carnivale!!!  Check your dictionary again, please.  (Dyeing one's hair jet black, wearing ugly, ill-fitting black clothing and mascara, and moping around listening to pampered, whiny, self-loathing musicians hardly qualifies as what is accepted to mean 'gothic' in American vernacular.)

Aside from that, only 4 negative reviews out of 114?  That means that 96.5% of these reviews are POSITIVE.  BUY THIS SERIES-FIRST AND SECOND SEASON, IT IS WORTH IT!!",1151625600,16,1119,5.416184971098266

2150906,5,B0002YLC1U,"When it comes right down to it, things that are complex and hard to follow usually go away fast. This is the category that Carnivale has sadly fallen into. Just after 24 episodes and a 2 season run, HBO decided NOT to renew the show for a 3rd season. But of course that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the show on DVD. The complete first season of Carnivale is a wonder to behold, a true good vs evil story set in the 1930s. Of course the two key players won't meet and fight until the very last episode of s2, but it is one hell of a roller coaster ride in s1 that sets up the events in s2 very nicely. So, if you are bored of those retarded ""reality shows"" and stupid network TV shows and want something cinematic and beautiful, watch Carnivale. IMO, its the best visual looking show of all time, just watch the opening credits and you'll be hooked. Shame on you HBO, do we really need another season of Sopranos?",1145232000,7,912,4.217142857142857

The sets on the show are awesome!  They ""feel"" so real... so gritty and authentic... it makes it seem as if you are really in the dustbowl.  But even more important than the sets, the casting is absolutely perfect.  The performances are sharp and you find yourself totally immersed in the storyline and in the time period.

This is another case of a series that ended before its time.  I could not believe that HBO cancelled this gem.  I don't hold out much hope that it will be picked up again, but this is one series that deserves a conclusion.",1128038400,4,640,4.364406779661017

 See I am awed, I never expected to be so drawn into a story. There is beauty hidden in every moment of this series. The story itself a tale of good vs. evil. Simple, not in any way shape or form. Complex, compelling, exciting, thrilling even,at times mind bending ,dark and light inter mingle,you will be stunned silent and moved so deeply you may shout at the screen, thought provoking to say the least.

Things I have learned or learned more about while viewing this show: the depression era, about early 20th century Carnivale's and how they worked and the type of people who worked them, The Trinity bomb testing, the philosophies of Plato, the Knights of Templar, The Masons, Buddhism, Avatars through the ages, boxing and baseball in the 30's, mining in the early 20th century, prostitution in the depression era, Evangelism, Creatures of Light,Creatures of Dark, The Alpha and the omega, occultism, medical afflictions of the early 20th century that had many termed ""freaks"", faith healers, and so much more.

Can you name a show that's not considered educational program that makes you want to learn, to expand your knowledge of the when,where, what and who that story is based on. That causes in you such a thirst for more of the story that you explore all aspects of it. If you can please email me, because I'd love to see it.

That's exactly how hungry for more of the story you become. Sadly, I can't tell you all that much about the actual story. I would only shame the beauty that is the story. It's far to deep and curious for me to describe justly. But in Carnivale you are being given a gift, a gift of a story and the beautiful way it is told. It's like a comet shower that happens once in a million years, a chance of a lifetime to see something unlike anything you have ever seen.

2150925,4,B0002YLC1U,"It's a comforting thing to see that HBO is continually adding to its impressive ouevre of television drama and comedy. They have literally raised the bar from the 'its-all-over-in-an-episode' drama of the mid-90's (Murder One excepted), to something more of a character study in which plot takes a back seat. The same is true of Carnivale. The most interesting part of the show is the interactions between and the development of the characters, and their reactions to various crises. Bad guys aren't all bad, good guys aren't all good. There's shades of grey. It makes for a continually surprising viewing experience.

Basically, the show begins with the Carnivale picking up the taciturn and mysterious Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl). On the other side of America, Brother Justin (Clancy Brown) is being spoken to by God, ""like he spoke to Moses"" he says. Both of these men dream about the other, despite never having met. Both seem to have some kind of special power they deny. To say any more would be to spoil it, except that we meet everyone involved in the lives of the two men. On Hawkins' side we meet the Carny folks and on Justin's side we meet his sister, his mentor, his congregation and the ghosts of his past.

These two stories travel concurrently and sweep you along for the ride. If there is any criticism to be levelled at the show, it's that Ben Hawkins takes a back seat for much of the series. There's only a very slight development of his character and what he's capable of. Also, the most interesting character, that of Brother Justin, suffers from this same lack of airtime. Clancy Brown shines in every scene that he's in. He's given the juiciest lines and a healthy dose of inner conflict. It's a shame that perhaps we only get to see him about 10% of the time in each episode. Most of the time is therefore reserved for the characters in the Carnivale, mostly Sophie, the fortune teller with a telekinetic, comatose mother.

The show moves slowly and anybody looking for plot driven action should probably avoid it. This is most certainly a character piece. The technicalities of the show are infallible, and period setting is totally convincing and the performances are excellent. Highly recommended.",1123286400,7,2222,4.796344647519582

2150929,5,B0002YLC1U,"The first season of HBO's now cancelled Carnivale is a wondrous introduction to the eclectic bunch that will fight the battle between good and evil.  With a stellar cast, brilliant direction, and a novel take on an old theme, Carnivale is perfect viewing for intelligent TV watchers worldwide.

The twelve episodes presented here set the stage for an epic story, in which Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) and Brother Justin (Clancy Brown) discover innate talents for powers of good and evil, respectively.  While the pacing is somewhat slow for a first season, the explorations of key characters in the series  make losses all the more painful and triumphs that much more celebrated.  The photography and transfer onto disc are spellbinding, showing that each cent of the $4 million spent per episode went into the phonomenal production values.

The ensemble cast of the series is magnificent.  While many faces are familiar, each actor shines in ways previously unseen.  The storylines, meanwhile, are engrossing, inviting viewers into a world both grimly realistic and utterly supernatural.

While the pricetag is substantial on this collection, it is more than a recommended purchase.  For viewers hungry to see what groundbreaking drama can become on television, this series cannot be more appropriate, despite the scant ""extras"" included.  The story of Carnivale is the selling point here, and it is utterly priceless.",1121904000,5,1415,5.272321428571429
2150930,5,B0002YLC1U,"HBO publicizes their dramas as powerful, compelling and groundbreaking...and I can say this, they sure as hell weren't joking. What amazes me is that HBO continues to stun us, to show that TV doesn't have to be boring or shallow. And Carnivale continues that tradition very well. First, I'll give a quick run-through of the story.

The story is set in the 30's, in the first episode...we see a boy, Ben Hawkins....his mother just passed away in a desolate area. A passing Carnival stops and they offer the boy a place to stay in return for help around the Carnival. Was picking him up there just a coincidence?  The Carnival is run by Samson, a little man who claims to take orders from ""Management"". Who is Management? We don't know and he is never shown. Samson's right hand man is Jonesy, who is very loyal and trustworthy to Samson because of something Samson helped him with, but what? We don't know. We then find that Ben Hawkins has a gift. He can heal people, but we then find out that's just icing on the cake. He is apparently meant for greater things, but what? Meanwhile, Lodz, a blind entertainer in the Carnival is increasingly interested in Ben. He knows about the gift and seems to be pestering Ben to let him help...but Ben already in a confused state, refuses time and again. There are many other interesting characters in Carnivale. In another place, we are given glimpses of the life of Brother Justin, a preacher who also has certain gifts. The lifes of both Ben and Brother Justin seem destined to collide, but how? Carnivale is filled with mysteries like this.

I think the opening credits of this show describes it the best. We are shown tarot cards, and the camera zooms in different cards to reveal different events in human history, most seem to reveal the degradation of humans. Like that, the story for Carnivale has many layers, some seem to interweave with others. What fascinates me is how it is written. There seem to be bits and pieces of information in every episode, it seems that the writers tease us by leaving clues for the audience to figure out the story. But let me tell you, no matter how much you think you know, the events that occur will stun you, right up to it's amazing season finale. To be honest, after watching the 1st episode, the show did not immediately appeal to me...I found it very slow paced but give it time, it will definitely leave a lasting impression.

The cast are nothing short of impressive. Because there is less dialogue, they have to be able to ""act"" out their feelings and thoughts. They do a more than commendable job, especially Nick Stahl who plays Ben Hawkins. But really, everyone else around him provides the backbone for this show as well. Other things that left me in wonder is the set, and the costumes. It creates a very real-like atmosphere of the 30's and a time of suffering and stunted development.

In short, this show continues to prove why HBO is the best channel out there. It breaks the norm of TV programming, it is actually like a long movie broken up to episodes, a show about good and evil, filled with hidden meanings and mystical powers. It's the kind of show that gets better with repeated viewings. Whatever reasons HBO had to end the show at Season 2, I'm sure it was a creative decision rather than a financial one. Probably the writers went as far as they could and decided to end it rather than continue with a lame storyline. Highly recommended folks!",1121558400,3,3454,4.58252427184466

I caught the last half hour of the first episode and was hooked!

The show weaves between the worlds of life and death, in a truly metaphyscial way that engages the viewer past the norm and into the world of wonder. Where death does not mean the end as the power of resurrection can bring you back. However there is a price, a trade that must happen!

The show unfolds beautifully, and is unpredictable in the way the plot builds then suddenly twists. It satisfies the artist inside all of us, delivering a visual feast as well.

Once you get into this series everything else pales in comparision. Every drop of the show is fanstastic. The cast, the story, you will yearn more............",1119052800,,758,4.551470588235294

Even though the cancellation is supposed to be based on low ratings, I thought Carnivale would continue as a prestige production.  Does Dodge make billions on the Viper or GM billions on the Corvette?  They're prestige products meant to generate buzz and foot traffic at the dealers (along with a tidy side profit, I'm sure).

Good grief, how long did they let Arliss live?

I hope fan action can save Carnivale.  In the meantime I'll rewatch the first season DVDs and wait for the second season to come out.  I've cancelled my HBO subscription and let them know why.",1117843200,,663,4.71304347826087

2150938,5,B0002YLC1U,"It is difficult to find words to begin to describe this fantastic show.  First of all, the writing is superb.  There are elements of this story that cause the viewer to jump online, or run to the local library to dig up more information about what is presented.  There is a richness in the storytelling that is not often seen on television today.  For every thing we are told, there are close to twenty things we are not told...which truly involves the viewer in the show.  It encourages active viewing, speculation, discussion, and research among other things.  That is not to say that one could not simply watch the show and get a supreme level of enjoyment form it.  The first season, I was a quasi-active viewer, and still found it to be the best show I had ever seen.  The imagery the dialogue creates is beyond belief.  And of course, what is great writing without great talent to deliver the lines?  In the forefront, there are powerful actors such as Clancy Brown as the conflicted Brother Justin, and Nick Stahl as the quiet yet intriguing Ben Hawkins.  To see the seemingly unconnected stories between these two characters evolve is an amazing event.  The show also features Tim DeKay, Clea Duvall, Cynthia Ettinger, Amy Madigan, Michael J. Anderson, Toby Huss, Brian Turk, Adrienne Barbeau, John Savage and even Pa Walton himself, Ralph Waite.  If one is a fan of anyone of these actors, their talents are highlighted in this series.  Emotions run high through the entire first season, and these actors know exactly how to portray them.  And what is great writing and beautiful acting without a spectacular back drop for the action to take place?  From the windy sandstorms of Dustbowl Oklahoma to the beautiful country side of rural California, every set is perfect.  The eyes are given gorgeous images to absorb.  Finally, and most importantly, the sheer involvement of the stor alone.  As I mentioned previously, this show makes one an active viewer.  If you have ever, for a moment, believed in the age of wonder...the magic of the past...this series is definately worth the money.  Elements of our every day lives are brought into question, and an entirely new world is created before your eyes.  I challenge every  person who buys the first season DVDs to watch only one episode at a time.  Watch one and wait a week before you view another.  I bet you can't.  You will find yourself eager to see what happens next.  If you did not think this was possible with a television show, remember...it's not television...it's HBO.",1117584000,4,2539,4.763761467889908

The delirious absentia of loss, love, poverty, religion, and the possibilities of magic. This is cinema, not series. Carnivale invites comparisons that run the gamut from mid-century literature to freakish screen gems to thematic musical compositions to regular old television series' like ""Twin Peaks.""  But it's an entirely original proposition.

The premise is an intelligent working out of themes specific to American culture (but, in this case, not at all dumbed down by it): the peculiar Biblical proportions of the Depression's Dustbowl, the mundane implications of the U.S's early (and ongoing) bid for global superiority, the idea of evangelism, the scope of radio and broadcasting, what's behind our selection of folk heroes, our vibrant, evolving, idiomatic language, the character of the American West, and some of our most understudied and overlooked cultural families: carnies, Okies, early Evangelists.

These themes are all serviced by acting, direction, cinematography, costuming, props, lighting, music, and sets that are best described as gloriously authentic.

2150950,5,B0002YLC1U,"""Carnivale"" has now become my favorite show.  I didn't know much about it when I got the first season on DVD for Christmas.  I just knew that it looked like something that I'd really like.  It seemed to have that strangeness and darkness that I find so fascinating at times.  I think it only took two episodes, and I was hooked.  I finished the 12 episodes in less than two weeks.  Never has a show grab my attention like ""Carnivale.""  It is one of the most unique, beautiful and disturbing shows I have ever seen.

The year is 1934, a pretty dark and depressing time in history.  A traveling carnival finds Ben Hawkins, a restless kid that has a lot of mystery to him.  He turns out to have a rather remarkable gift of healing, but he has yet to learn the true power of it... or the consequences.  States and states away is Brother Justin Crowe, a man of God.  He has always tried to serve the Lord to the best of his abilities, until he starts finding out strange things about himself.  A darkness within that reveals itself little by little until it is all clear what his real purpose is.  This sets the stage for the ultimate battle between good and evil.  Even though Ben and Justin have not met each other, they know their paths will meet eventually.

The first season is really a set-up of things to come, but boy does it ever hook you in.  The show is so well-written and well-acted.  At first, you're not entirely sure what's happening, but with each episode you learn a little more.  It doesn't cheat, either.  Everything is in there for a reason, even if it's not very clear at the beginning.  Out of the 12 episodes in this first season, I did not find a single episode that I didn't like.  All of the episodes are intense and mesmerizing.  Nick Stahl is terrific as ""Ben Hawkins"" and you really buy into his role right from the word, ""Go.""  The showstopper, in my opinion, is Clancy Brown, who plays ""Brother Justin.""  He is absolutely amazing in this show.  One of the best characters from a series in recent years.

If you plan to check out ""Carnivale,"" then you really have to give it a chance.  You have to let it soak into you.  It'll take at least two episodes to really pull you in.  It is a very complex show, so if you're looking for something simplistic, stay clear from this.  Also, the show can be extremely violent at times.  While it's not gratuitous, there are more than a few uneasy and disturbing scenes that will get to you, so be prepared for that.  The show looks BEAUTIFUL and the sound is superb.  There aren't many extras, except for three commentary tracks and a making-of featurette.  I really enjoyed the making-of featurette, but I suggest you watch that last.

""Carnivale"" is a phenomenal show.  It's really set my standards high when it comes to new shows, now.  After seeing this, it's hard for any other show to really grab me.  As soon as you finish the first season, you'll immediately want to watch the next season... hopefully that'll come out soon (if you thought this season was wild, you haven't seen nothin' yet!)  If you're looking for a creative and challenging show, this is the one for you.  Just be careful.  There's no turning back once you cross that road.  See how it all begins and witness the miracle that is ""Carnivale."" -Michael Crane",1113177600,35,3298,4.45393634840871
2150951,5,B0002YLC1U,"I started watching Carnivale with the general idea of the plot, the music, and the imagery sucking me in. The first few episodes are excellent; however, I agree with what others said in some reviews. There are some middle episodes that draaaaaag on. Once it gets passed these episodes, things start to pick up again. I would also agree with the idea that season 1 won't leave you with many questions answered.

However, if you have HBO, you can attest to how amazing Season 2 is. It seems like HBO plans to cut it after this season, so things are moving very quickly compared to season 1. My boyfriend who hated it originally, now eagerly asks me when its on next (my family has HBO On demand).

I plan to buy the season 2 when it comes out, and that leaves me little choice to buy season 1 to have the whole set.

So if you didn't like season 1 or are iffy, watch season 2 and when put together, the show is absolutely amazing.",1111968000,7,928,4.291428571428572

And now the second season is being shown and does it ever deliver! And I'm beggining to see parallels between Brother Justin's manipulation of the votes of his poverty sticken followers and some things that are happening in today's political arena. And who got these actors together on the same show?  Wow. My personal character favorites is the ""cooch"" show family, where old dad pimps his wife and daughter out on the side.

Yes, there are distinctive forces of good and evil, dark and light, but there is a large ground of moral ambiguity in between that we have to navigate on our own.",1111881600,7,947,4.601190476190476

2150954,5,B0002YLC1U,"If one were to look back on HBO's track record for TV shows, they would see an incredible mix of superior shows that are almost perfect in every way. From the prison drama Oz to mafia life in The Sopranos, to new shows like the phenomenal Deadwood and the great show Carnivale, which I'm reviewing here.

Carnivale takes place in 1934, in the dustbowl of America during a sad period of history, the depression. ""To each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness."" So says Samson(Michael J. Anderson) at the very start of the first episode. Samson is the head of a particular Carnivale that comes across Ben Hawkins(Nick Stahl), an escaped convict that has just lost his mother. Ben is the creature of light that Samson and the other carnies except into their fold, and soon Ben finds himself traveling through the dustbowl of America with this Carnivale. What Samson and his right hand man Jonesy(Tim DeKay) don't know is that Ben has the power to heal, but at a price.

Back in California is the creature of darkness, Brother Justin Crowe(Clancy Brown) a minister who can cause people to have troubling visions about their worst sins. Brother Justin is bringing about the Apocalypse even though he doesn't realize it. Brother Justin doesn't even believe he's evil, nor does his sister Iris Crowe(Amy Madigan) who has what one can only call an 'odd' realationship with her brother.

Along the way we meet plenty of strange and intersting characters. There's Sophie(Clea DuVall) who is a Tarot card reader, even though it's her catatonic mother who is the real fortune teller. There's also Professor Lodz(Patrick Bauchau) a blind man with a cane who can touch people or items and read them. Lodz has a strange relationship with the bearded lady of the carnivale, Lila(Debra Christofferson) who is most times conniving and outspoken. There's also the Dreifuss family who run the Kooch show at the carnivale, with an intersting mother and daughters act. There's Ruthie(Adrienne Barbeau), an older woman who is a hypnotic snake charmer and the mother of the strongman and who also takes quite an interest in Ben, as well as Sophie in the beginning. And then there's management, who's only a voice from behind a curtain. Management is a person you never see who makes all of the decisions about the carnivale and seems to have a hand at knowing everything that's going on. Only Samson and Lodz are even allowed to talk to management.

Throughout the season all of the characters go through many trials and mishaps. Brother Justin and Ben each wander the road to self discovery, as well as many of the other characters. There's plenty of droughy, incredible dust storms, murder and death as well as the classic X-files element of who do you trust, as Ben comes to find out from the very beginning. We see Carnival life as it was back then. The hardships, the money problems, the different ways the carnies would rip off ""Rubes,"" or customers. We get a perfect view of carnie life, in all of its beautiful and ugly glory. You see the different stages of the carnivale being put up and ripped back down.

Everything in this show is authentic, from the cars to the carnivale rides. The people who made this show actually bought original stuff to make the viewer feel like they are there, in the story, which brings me to another point. Pretty much everything that is shown in the show is real. Rarely is CGI ever used because the makers never wanted to bring the viewer out of frame of mind that this show was actually taking place in the 30's.

Another strong point of this show is that it's not something you can half-watch. As a viewer you have to watch everything that happens or you'll miss something important along the way. This is a show that makes the viewer think. You have to piece together this slowly unraveling mystery that twists and turns at every corner. A big part of this show is showing, not telling. There's not a whole lot of dialogue. Most of the points and feelings are made through strong imagery and emotion emitted from the wonderful actors and actresses in this series.  The title sequence is incredibly artful and the cinemtography is wonderful, with full mountain ranges and miles of desert surrounding most of the carnivale locations.

This is a show filled with wonder and mysticism. It's ground in very believible reality and then there's moments of magic and enchantment that fuels the story and leaves you craving more, without ever taking you out of the reality part of the story. They filmakers have crafted such a wonderful universe here that the viewer can believe when magic takes place, without doubting the reality behind it. Another strong point of the show is that it moves along and builds slowly. Some people might not enjoy this, but that's part of the reason it's a thinking show, but with the slow build occuring, moments of violence, magic or visions jump out at you that much more and are more vivid and emotional.

This is an incredible show and I hope HBO keeps making dramas as good as all of their others. My only real complaint is that I don't have HBO and therefore can't watch season two that is on right now. I guess I'll just have to wait until it comes out to DVD too.",1109721600,20,5245,4.686210640608035

Well, Carnivale is just as excellent, if not even better.

I hate television. Besides sports shows, I don't even watch t.v. because I think all the shows are 100% crap--even the news.

So I mainly watch movies at the theaters. I average about two movies per week.

I think Carnivale and Deadwood are both better than 99% of the movies I see at the movie theaters in terms of plot, characterization, setting, and picture quality.

Heck, make that 100% because I can't think of a single movie that can beat Deadwood and Carnivale in terms of overall package.",1109548800,7,612,4.62962962962963
2150956,4,B0002YLC1U,"Anyone knows that over the past few years HBO has had plenty of fan favorite run away hits.  The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Oz, and recently Deadwood and the Wire have received plenty of critical acclaim and viewer accolades, while this series hasn't received as much fanfare as one would hope.  Taking place in 1934 in the Oklahoma dustbowl, Carnivale introduces us to Ben Hawkins (Terminator 3's Nick Stahl), a lonely young man who finds himself a job at a traveling carnival run by Samson (Michael J. Anderson).  At the same time in California, there is Brother Justin Crowe (Highlander and Shawshank Redemption's Clancy Brown, perfectly cast), a mysterious preacher who isn't what he seems, and as we the viewers discover, he and Ben have plenty in common.  With the foreshadowing of an apocalyptic confrontation, and a superbly chosen cast (which includes Amy Madigan as Crowe's sister, as well as Clea DuVall and Adrienne Barbeau as fellow carnival members), Carnivale shows loads of promise, even if it's premise does begin to wear thin before the season finale.  Like HBO's superb Deadwood, this is a period drama that isn't for everyone, but hopefully this Carnivale will last long enough to fully deliver it's potential.  It's dreadfully underrated, and you should most definitely give it a chance.",1109289600,9,1331,5.054794520547945
2150957,5,B0002YLC1U,"No more needs to be said about how HBO has literally revitalized television, we all know that.  What some may not yet know is that, of all their superior past and current offerings (Tales from the Crypt, Sex and the City, The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm), Carnivale takes the prize for the BEST of the best thus far.

Carnivale is incredibly well-written and shot, sporting some of the most intricate, clever and shocking storylines ever put to film.  It is absolutely mesmerizing, and for proof of this I suggest episode 5, which is almost hallucinogenic in its visual power.

Obviously the show is not for everyone and is extremely mature on both literal and thematic levels.  However, those begging for a hint of entertainment and/or intellectual engagement in the vast wasteland that is network television may find that they've found in Carnivale a dark place of mystery, wonder and horror from which it is difficult to escape (I find myself thinking about each episode long after the TV is dark--and, yes, this show has entered my nightmares more than once!).

This intense and dark drama of apocalyptic visions features characters that pop and visuals that stun.  Weave these elements into a haunting and desperate period of American history, the depths of the depression circa 1934, and you have one of the best shows ever made for television.

2150959,5,B0002YLC1U,"When I first watched this show I adored it.  Battle for good and evil, good music and cinematography, Clancy Brown, etc.

But my concern with the DVD was the expense, and the desire to watch it over and over.  I am currently on viewing four in the last month, and I can attest to the fact that it actually improves upon rewatching.  Though other reviewers complain regarding the pacing (and I did the first time through) it is truly where the genius of the series lies.  Unlike more traditional serials, the writers do not need to show all their cards immediately, and while on the first watching I was saying things like ""don't dwell on this subplot, tell me about the bear,"" it makes the inevitable explanation that much sweeter.  Also, unlike the X-Files, the show has proven to me in only 14 episodes (time of this review) that there will not be a forgotten symbol or plot point.  The black goo will not be different in two seasons, and while I may know more about the tree tattoo by the end, it's meaning will not change or be lost.

In the first episode when Hawkins gets his tarot reading from Sophie.  She asks him if he wants his past, present, or future, and he dismissively says it doesn't matter.  He then gets a reading which is clearly his past.  But each time you go back and watch the first episode, it is clear that it actually doesn't matter.  That what she tells him is true of the past, present and future.

2150961,5,B0002YLC1U,"""Carnivale"" exists on the knife-edge between reality and dreams. It has the passion and dream-like quality of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel, deeply imbued with the full emotional, carnal and physical spectrum of human existence. It exists simultaneously in the middle of dust bowl life and in the `promised land' of California, creating a place that's ultimately without time or bounds. Even the environment is a character into itself -- gritty, wind blown landscapes interspersed with auburn vistas of California. A lone, twisted tree in a desertscape. Terrain that's thirsty for something yet to be defined. (Kudos for setting high standards for production - and thanks to Rodrigo for carrying on the family tradition with his own unique visualizations.)

Characters and their relationships with each other are carefully drawn yet subject to change without notice. Just as you begin to believe you can count on something as constant, something shifts. Even characteristics thought final in ""reality"" (blindness, lameness, time, death) are changed as characters progress through the interwoven story lines. Like the foreshadowing of a gun placed casually on a mantelpiece, you must watch the series carefully to understand how the slightest movement, glance, action or even shadow seems to influence outcomes in later episodes.

The supernatural plays a role here, but it's a shape-shifting one, and it's not clear what the outcome will be or how long it will take to get there. It is clear to me however that the writers intend to shake our belief in the black-and-whiteness of good and evil by showing us just how little distance exists between the two - and that what we see isn't necessarily what is real - or even if what is real is what matters most.

If your passion is for clearly drawn characters that progress and change during the events they encounter towards some concrete good-triumphs-over-evil finale, this series will likely dunk you rather unpleasantly in the deep end and leave you gasping for air. If you however appreciate the wonder of a multi-faceted story that twists and turns and makes you question what's relevant to its progress, by all means dive in.

I do keep wondering though if some character will wake up at the end of the series (a la Robert DeNiro) and make you wonder if it was all just an opium hallucination, as ethereal and elusive as smoke. But in the meantime... what a ride we have in store!",1105401600,12,2436,4.9926108374384235
2150962,3,B0002YLC1U,"At first, the music (something that sounds like it came direct from a Cirque du Soleil CD) and the premise draw you in.  A depression era carnival show, the dust bowl at its worse, the muscular but broken carnies, the coo chi, coo chi girls, the bearded lady, the lizard man and the mysterious guy who runs the whole thing known only as ""management.""  Who could resist all that?  Not to mention the tall, darkly troubled minister in the throws of discovering that he has powers beyond those of any mortal man.

But around episode six, you realize that while the characters are interesting and the situation compelling, the writers seem to think, that after creating that canvas they could just put their feet up and rest.  Nothing happens.  Aside from the handsome and confused minister, played with class and skill by Clancy Brown (probably best known for his role as the evil Kurgan in the first Highlander film), everybody else predictably moves through their lives, doing a lot of nothing, having a bunch of manufactured dilemmas that no one cares about.

2150963,3,B0002YLC1U,"If you missed HBO's eerie, mesmerizing series that starts out in the Dust Bowl during the Depression, check out CARNIVALE THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON (Warner).

Moody, atmospheric, ambitious, mysterious, kinky and addictive, this episodic, novel-like tale follows Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) who has lost his mother, is dirt poor (literally) and alone when he joins a passing carnival en route to the West.

Samson, the diminutive carnival manager (Michael J. Anderson) is like a father to his ""family"" of fringe dwelling freaks and other side show professionals -- some of whom appear to have otherworldly powers, including one Hawkins reveals about himself.

This period drama dabbles in supernatural, spiritual, and fate-tempting conflicts that are not always clearly resolved, but certainly not unsatisfying if you surrender to the mystical journey that binds them in a time and place they cannot escape.

Fabulous production design and cinematography heighten all facets of this drama that is much more about the process of revealed destiny than resolution of conflict.

Like life, there are always loose ends, but it is the moments of mystery and wonder that catch our attention.  And that is gift enough.",1104883200,11,1206,5.321052631578947
2150964,4,B0002YLC1U,"When HBO first aired ""Carnivale"", I had no interest in watching a show about a carnival. Deprived of my ""Sex and the City"" which was off the air, never to return and ""The Sopranos"", which takes too long to return, I gave up on television. One day, while home sick from school, my 17 year-old daughter watched a ""preview"" of Carnivale and was more than excited to show it to me upon my arrival home from work later that day. That was when I suddenly became intrigued with ""Carnivale"". The story wasn't just about carnies, it was a story about good versus evil; light versus dark; healing versus destroying. Suddenly, I wanted to watch and it wasn't long before I got my wish. New Years weekend, I spent an entire day wrapped up in all 12 episodes of this magnificent show. The acting is exemplary; the scenes are riveting; the storyline is intriguing; the sets are amazing. This show is nothing like what I imagined it to be. It is so much better. Some people have said the show was boring. If you can't deal with actually seeing a prequel before seeing the main storyline, don't bother watching. What can I tell you? I am thrilled with the fact that for once, someone has decided to start a show from the beginning, explaining how things came to be and where it all started. I am anxiously awaiting season 2, which starts this month and even more thrilled to be adding this set to my video collection.",1104796800,8,1401,4.4765625
2150965,5,B0002YLC1U,"In a short period of time, ""Carnivale"" has grown into my favorite television show. Structured like a dense, epic novel, the production values are sumptuous, the acting uniformly ingenious, and the central mysteries complex and involving. The series, ostensibly about the final battle between good and evil, as wonder gives way to reason, is so firmly rooted in a three-dimensional, realistic world with three-dimensional realistic characters that I would classify it as more magical realism than science-fiction or fantasy. The characters drive the plot, rather than the other way around, which is a difficult feat to accomplish in such a complex narrative that includes shadowy symbolism and prophetic dreams. There have been complaints that the first season did not wrap up any loose ends, but why should it? Season 1 is but the prologue to this novel-for-television, and narratives are never concluded in the prologue. Be forewarned, though, if you are looking for a television show that does not tax your intellectual muscles and does not ask you to do some work to understand it, this is not the show for you. If, on the the other hand, you are looking for a show that is fascinating, multi-layered (the symbolism alone could be discussed for hours), and intellectually stimulating, with fantastical situations that still manages to maintain a strong verisimilitude of character and the time period in which it occurs (1934, the Great Depression, in the Dust Bowl), I would urge you to watch this DVD set immediately, so you can be caught up for the second season, which premieres January 9th. The video quality of this DVD set, by the way, is among the finest I have ever seen.

2150967,5,B0002YLC1U,"""Carnivle"" is part of small but growing number of quality television shows that are committed to the sort of lengthy and complex story arc that was once the province of the mini-series.  But shows like ""Wiseguy"" and ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" in the past and current offerings such as ""24"" and ""Lost"" have paved the way for television shows that emphasize the big picture rather than the more traditional episodic approach.  As such, ""Carnivle"" is most similar to ""Lost,"" in that we are pretty sure we know what will happen at the end of the journey, but we have no idea how many seasons down the road that end game will be played out.  Does creator Daniel Knauf (""Wolf Lake"") have an ambitious five-year plan similar to what J. Michael Straczynski had in mind from the start for ""Babylon 5""?  We will have to wait and see.

With a show like ""Carnivle"" it is easy (and fun) to play with various antecedents that explain the series in simple but readily understood terms.  From the start I was thinking of the show as a cross between John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" Tod Browning's ""Freaks,"" and Stephen King's ""The Stand,"" all of which I consider to be classics in their respective genres.  But there are other options as well (with Michael J. Anderson in the cast ""Twin Peaks"" becomes an obvious choice), which simply speaks to the potential of ""Carnivle"" to resonate with its viewers.

The premise of the show is provided as the opening narration: ""Before the beginning, after the great war between Heaven and Hell, God created the Earth and gave dominion over it to the crafty ape he called man. And to each generation was born a creature of light and a creature of darkness. And great armies clashed by night in the ancient war between good and evil. There was magic then, nobility, and unimaginable cruelty. And so it was until the day that a false sun exploded over Trinity, and man forever traded away wonder for reason."" The words are spoken by Samson (Anderson), who runs the traveling circus called Carnivle, but answers to the unseen ""Management"" figure (voiced by an uncredited Linda Hunt).

While traveling across the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in 1934, the Carnivle comes across Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), who has escaped from prison and returned home in time to watch his mother (Lucinda Jenney) die and bury here before the tractors level their shack.  Management wants Ben to join the caravan and given his predicament with the law, he agrees.  As the Carnivle travels down to Texas we learn that Ben is plagued by strange visions of the trenches in the Great War and that he has the power to heal.  Meanwhile, in the California town of Mintern a minister named Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown) believes that God is telling him what to minister to the growing number of Okies and other migrant workers streaming west, fleeing the Dust Bowl.  Those who oppose Brother Justin's plans find themselves punished for standing in the way.

Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin are the creatures of light and darkness foretold, and while their visions contain glimpses of each other, they are not going to meet during this first season of ""Carnivle.""  Their meeting is inevitable and clearly will constitute the apocalyptic conclusion of this series, but at this point they are still coming to terms with their places in this strange universe.  Each man is trying to find out about their mysterious past, where they came from, and what they can do with their powers.  Eventually they will have to decide what they should do with those powers and at the end of the first season they face what will certainly be the first of several escelating crucibles.

While the focus is primarily on Ben Hawkins getting used to his power and Brother Justin doing his work with his older sister, Iris (Amy Madigan), there is also life in the travelling circus during the Great Depression.  Ben is of interest to Lodz (Patrick Bachauh), a mentalist who takes an active interest in the young man's powers and who is involved with Lila (Debra Christofferson), the bearded lady.  Meanwhile, Ben has taken an interest in Ruthie (Adrienne Barbeau), the snake charmer who is also the mother of the strong man, Gabriel (Brian Turk).  The person interested in Ben romantically appears to be Sophie (Clea DuVall), the tarot card reader who is also the medium for her comatose mother, Apollonia (Diane Salinger), who is pyschic.  Jonesy (Tim Dekay), the manger of the rousties, is in love with Sophie, but he gets involved with the Dreifuss family that runs the Cootch Show, Stumpy (Toby Huss), the father who is the emcee, mother Rita Sue (Cynthia Ettinger), and daughters Dora Mae (Amanda Aday) and Libby (Carla Gallo).

One of the strengths of ""Carnivle"" is that what is going on in that travelling circus is fairly interesting even without throwing young Ben Hawkins into the mix.  There is something intrinsically fascinating about how carny folk milk the marks for money, and there is a sense of personal pride in their professionalism that gives them a certain level of dignity.  In the short term, I do not know if I like the idea that not all of them are going to be alive next season.  Then, of course, there is the whole look of the show.  Suffice it to say ""Carnivle"" won Emmys for Outstanding Art Direction and Cinematography for a One-Camera Series, along with those for Costumes, Hairstyling, and Main Title Design (you could do a pretty good master's thesis just decoding that last one).

The DVD series for the first season comes with three audio commentaries, a really short featurette on the making of the series, and a giant group discussion with the cast.  The commentary for ""Milfay,"" the pilot episode, is the most important one, and twice as good as the other two put together.  It has Knauf, director Rodrigo Garcia, and executive producer Howard Klein on it, with the creator/writer and director doing most of the talking, who focus on how they cast the show and how the first episode evolved.  We also get the ""Previously On"" and ""Next On"" bits that HBO created for each episode.

I recognize that ""Carnivle"" is going to be a very maddening show to those who want things to move along at a brisk pace, and there will be those who will abandon the show long before it gets to the promised land (when the circus gets to California, probably in a couple of seasons).  But for those of us who remember how ""Twin Peaks"" fell apart when the hook of ""Who killed Laura Palmer?"" became the line and (literal) sinker, or who felt ""The X-Files"" was adding to its mythology without getting any closer to a big finish, the idea that ""Carnivle"" has been created with a definitive end point in mind provide some measure of comfort.  This first season provides an initial level of confidence and the potential for more, but in the end how good this series is with come down to the quality of the final ""blow off.""  Given that the origin of ""carnival"" goes back to the Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Lupercalia where there was a temporary subversion of civil order and that the term now refers to the holiday period of the two weeks before Lent, it could be something pretty good.  Besides, it is not on television: it is on HBO.",1103414400,380,7220,4.711446740858506
2150968,5,B0002YLC1U,"In an age where there is so much garbage on television, it is refreshing to find that there are shows around that dare to force you to use the gray matter that is stuffed inside your skull...The plot of Carnivale will not appeal to everyone and there is some debate about what the plot actually is...Carnivale, set in the Depression era Dust Bowl of the midwest, is a tale where the forces of good will be pitted against evil.....the montage of images during the main titles illustrates historically that the world will soon be plunged into such an epic battle of ""Wills"" known as World War II... will 30's America be facing a similiar ""political"" battle or will this war be between apocalyptic forces? This remains to be seen, but though the plot does develop slowly, the strength of the ensemble cast is so strong, that even rather non-momentus moments in this series are facinating...the first season concerns the slow spiritual awakening for the main protagoninst Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl) and the rather rapid spiritual decline of Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown) both of whom share similiar dreams and powers..Hawkins however is rather reluctant to accept his gifts to the frustrating point that you want to slap some sense into the daft boy. By season's end, Brother Justin was beginning to get a measure of what he is capable of, and for added depth, you have ambivilent feelings towards the Preacher because he does show moments of kindness, only to be thwarted by his fellow man. You cannot help but pity him as you learn more of his past. He is not portrayed as a stereotypical villian.....Because Carnivale, as with THE WIRE, and LOST (when it's out on DVD), have so many layers of plot, these DVD's will not grow mold on your bookcase, for you will always go back to these type of brilliant shows and  discover something new....Enthusiastically Recommended!",1103328000,22,1872,4.831775700934579
2150969,4,B0002YLC1U,"Carnivale is a TV show that seemingly came out of nowhere and debuted on HBO in 2003. It depicts the struggle between good and evil, light vs. darkness and how they are forever intertwined. This battle takes place during the Depression with its focus on the inner workings of a traveling carnival.

Disc One features an audio commentary on ""Milfay"" by director Rodrigo Garcia, series creator Daniel Knauf and executive producer Howard Klein. This is a very informative track with all the participants making some good observations.

There is also an audio commentary on ""After the Ball is Over"" by director Jeremy Podeswa, Klein and Knauf. They talk about the casting of certain characters with people who looked like they came from that time period.

Disc Five features an audio commentary on ""Hot and Bothered"" by Podeswa, Klein and Knauf. They talk about the look of the show. One quickly gets the feeling that they started running out of things to say by this track judging by the lengthy lulls between comments.

The final disc has a Making Of featurette. Knauf felt that the inner workings of a carnival had never been dramatized before. The cast and crew talk about their characters and the themes of the show.

Ultimately, Carnivale poses a lot of questions. How did Ben and Justin get their powers and why them? How does Ben's fevered dreams of a man fighting in the bloody, dirty trenches of World War I figure in his past and that of the mysterious owner of the carnival whom we never see (and might not even be human)? By the end of the season there are precious few answers but some tantalizing clues that will hopefully be explored in more detail in the upcoming season.",1103241600,20,1684,4.714285714285714

I was glad to find I was not alone in thinking how beautifully filmed this is. The acting is top notch. The twist and turns in the story are perplexing and challenging to try and figure out.

But when the last frame of this season closed I was left with the feeling that I had wasted 12 hours of my life in a story so cryptic and nonsensical that I couldn't even imagine going back for the second season when it airs.

It's a slow and rambling story that starts with a bang, hooks and but never fully delivers on the promise. You will find NO answers in this season as to what is happening. You'll be given clues, hints and the occasional ""what the heck was that all about?"" moment. Nothing is ever clear.

I loved this series initially. I had high hopes for the it. Just the atmosphere alone of the carnivale and it's diverse performers is enticing. This show will keep you watching and wondering...but you'll get no payoff.

I read on HBO's website that they gave the creator full reign to stretch the story out over several seasons instead of compacting it into two seasons. Even the creator admitted he wasn't sure how the story was going to end. That's when I said no more for me.

HBO's series are generally second to none but this was a true misfire (The Mind Of A Married Man is another HBO dud). I don't know anyone, either friends or coworkers, who stuck with Carnivale to the end.

I won't go into detail about each character and episode, but suffice to say that, if you're someone who enjoys the WRITING of Stephen King (not many of the awful films based on his books) this series is for you.  While Stephen King is in no way associated with this series, the pacing, the characters, the ambience, the detail, and the plain bizzare nature of his brand of story telling are perfectly represented by Carnivale Season 1.  In fact, I have never seen a TV series or film that so accurately re-creates the pacing and detail of a great novel. However, if you are someone who is easily disturbed or just doesn't like tales of the mysterious and bizzare, this may not be for you.  If you are someone who hates loose ends and enjoys the plot being laid neatly before you, Carnivale is definately not for you; many, many questions are raised in Season 1 and very, very few are answered.

8034879,2,B0002YLC1U,"First episode has an interesting premise, but falls flat the further you go in. The show is dreary, which is what they wanted to capture, and they did that quite well. It is very drawn out, with not much happening.
In fact one scene shows the the tarot reader driving her truck with the ""new guy"" Hawkins as they were headed home. He literally gets out of the truck (she makes him get out), due to an argument they had and sits on the side of the road. Some moments later, they go back to the scene; it's dark out now, and he is still sitting on the side of the road, until she asks for a cigarette and he asks to be able to drive. Many minutes were wasted on just this one scene alone that does absolutely nothing for the show. So, yeah, there are a lot of ""nothing"" scenes. If you can get past those, then there is a slow brewing story.",1522800000,,838,4.084848484848485
8034880,2,B0002YLC1U,drags terribly.  not the greatest  acting.  story line not hold together much. don not bother,1521849600,,93,5.066666666666666
8034881,3,B0002YLC1U,"Mostly, ugly, plain unattractive actors are tiresome to watch after a while, especially the masculine female lead. I watch to be entertained, to escape - not to have my nose rubbed into gritty, hard scrabble reality. Yes, I hate indie movies, too. No wonder the series was killed four seasons early. The photography is excellent, however.",1521331200,,338,5.053571428571429
8034882,5,B0002YLC1U,so far so good! Sort of reminds me of American Horror Story.,1518566400,,60,4.083333333333333

8034884,4,B0002YLC1U,"I was reading a bio of someone, I forget who, on IMBD.  They said that they loved this show.  I have been getting HBO for years, and somehow I missed it!  So, I went looking and found it.  It was a very pleasant surprise.  I've read some of the one star reviews and was surprised by them, too.  I found this series to be terrific. I knew that it only lasted two seasons, and was concerned that it might leave me hanging.  It didnt.  I was nicely written to tie up loose ends.  I binge watched it all day and night. The acting was very good, and I thought the pacing was just right.  It kept me watching to the very end.  Of course, everyone's taste is different, but this fit my taste perfectly.",1516838400,,695,4.111940298507463
8034885,1,B0002YLC1U,"I can't believe anyone would like this series. Dark,everyone looked dirty especially the main character. I kept waiting for  the great reveal to be let down. Stupid of me to watch this to the end!",1516492800,,196,4.6
8034886,1,B0002YLC1U,"Carnivale is devolving into Twin Peaks. You know, the show that starts out great but ends up making absolutely no sense. Don't know why such great actors as Clancy Brown and Michael Anderson signed up. Season 1's plot wandered as if it did not know where it was going. Season 2 busted out into a over-complicated plot that is really ridiculous and disjointed. Little of the plot follows any line of sense. The story utilizes religious character iconology, like the devil and a healer, but follows no previously established religious guidelines. Almost like they stole characters from myth but none of the storyline. The show uses characters as time-wasting devices, picks them up when needed and drops them without explanation or backstory. Carnivale has great ratings on Amazon. There is no accounting for taste. I found it hard to finish Season 2. Watch at your own peril. I warned you. The producers must have really needed a project to take on this one. I hope you like it and do not find it a waste of time. I did.",1515974400,,1019,4.698324022346369
