I was very disappointed they did that after his death, if he wanted it done he'd of done it years ago... not happy with the results...:( Or the fact it was changed.",1317427200,,377,4.04
8374112,4,B002MVV0T0,"I purchased this set for my husband for Father's day. He would look for old episodes of Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone to show our children. My husband grew up watching the series on TV and thought our kids would enjoy it too. We were able to find 1 DVD and our kids watched it over and over until they learned all the words to the theme song!! So when I came across this set, I knew my family would enjoy it. My 2 sons, ages 4yrs. & 11 yrs., watch them with their Dad. Even my daughter, 8 yrs., watches occasionally so they can all get ideas for playing ""Cowboys & Indians"" together. They even go as far as all owning ""Coon skin hats"" to wear while watching the DVD's!
Wonderful, old-fashioned family entertainment!",1282176000,,715,4.303703703703704
8374113,5,B002MVV0T0,I am watching season 1 and am about half way through. The quality of the picture is fine and I am very happy with my purchase. I received it within the time frame indicated at time of sale and I received it in excellent condition. Thank you ttdakota! I was so glad to find this series. This is a first time purchase for me on Amazon and I will order more in the future. I am interested in only the very old TV programs I enjoyed as a child growing up in the 50's & 60's.,1274745600,,470,3.90625
