The character could just have been a Sherlock knock off but the writers and Quayle  played Strange as bright detective not genius. The stories are good little mysteries and the rest of the cast do well. I recommend it anyone who even remembers it it is fun!
Also very much in the time at the end of the mod era.",1457740800,,434,4.3580246913580245

8238080,5,B0010NRG9Y,"OK, so you get 16 episodes of a 1969 British TV show. Youngsters today may be surprised that all the great TV shows in the 60's came from Britain (Avengers, Secret Agent, Saint). This short-lived show could have made an impact had it run longer. Anthony Quayle is fine and his supporting cast of two regulars work well together.

The plots are mostly mysteries, with Quayle as Adam Strange playing the ""consulting detective"" kind of role. The quality of the stories ranges from a couple of really lame ones to several excellent ones. Unfortunately they have packages one of the lamest stories as the first in the set, so don't be put off.

The restoration is excellent, but did they really paint everything bright green in 60's London? The short skirts and long eyelashes are something to behold. Most of the settings seem to be filmed on location around London.

Highly recommended for Anthony Quayle fans. Too bad there are not more episodes.",1381708800,3,944,4.779141104294479
