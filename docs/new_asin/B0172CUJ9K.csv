8737975,5,B0172CUJ9K,"""Kung-Fu Master"" had long been unavailble in the U.S.  This is a superb blu-ray edition of one of my very favorite of Varda's works.  ""Jane B. par Agnes V."" is a rare and delightful bonus.  As a companion piece to ""Kung-Fu Master"", I highly recommend ""The Cement Garden"" by Jane Birkin's husband, Andrew, that also features Charlotte Gainsbourg.  https://www.amazon.com/Cement-Garden-Charlotte-Gainsbourg/dp/1567301789",1484006400,,418,6.033898305084746
