693982,5,630358490X,"Kia ora, this movie would be the most gripping movie I have seen. Being Maori, this movie has touched me in ways that it could only do to a Maori.  Maori have taken a big risk in releasing this movie for what could possibly  be mis-construed from it, but however we hope other cultures and indigenous  people will rise to the challenge and show the truth about what our worlds  have become. This movie shows the darker side Maoridom coming from a long  chain of tragic events leading up to today. Alan Duff (author) and Lee  Tamahori have made no efforts to sweeten this.  So from a Maori  perspective, this movie will change your life. I still hope though, we can  put out a movie soon to show the other side of our people.

What an absolutely WONDERFUL movie.  The acting was so real and the story just touched me so much.  It's one of those movies that you think about for months to come.  I'm off to buy the movie now.",1056067200,2,342,4.044776119402985
694204,5,630358490X,"This is an excellent movie about the modern everyday life of the Maori in New Zealand.  It's a very realistic movie about family, love, alcoholism and domestic violence.  It's interesting to see the tattooed bodies of the Maori gang.  Many tattoos we wear in America are actually replicas of their tribal tattoos which is an insult to the Maori.  This is a great piece.",1055894400,,369,4.71875
694205,5,630358490X,"This movie impacted me on so many levels. Every one of the actors was excellent, especially Temuera Morrison and Rena Owen.
This story is not just a story about a native family and the effects of modern society on their lives and culture (although it does that very well) but it is also a story of the cruel effects that an abusive parent can have on his children.
This movie will stay with me for a very long time.",1055030400,,415,4.265822784810126
694206,5,630358490X,"When the movie first came out on HBO I was ""whoa"".. and was hooked.

The movie itself shows the 'pride' and the roots of the Maori people. Whether it was in Jake, Beth or the kids. It showed many differences in having pride or trying to achieve it and also not to forget their roots and where they came from. It shows that one doesn't have to be 'set' in the structure of what or where society has placed them, you can change it if you really want to.

I was both happy and saddened to what the contents of the movie had showed. Happy that it showed true to the culture of what the Maori people once were as a community in the old teachings but saddened in what future holds for life anywhere with the same circumstances.

I'm originally from Hawaii myself, Part Hawaiian/Tahitian/mix and I've got Maori cousins.. (they're really tall people.)

Also an update ""Once were warriors"" the sequel is now out.. just that it's international.. :( sry US...",1051574400,,948,4.46242774566474
694207,5,630358490X,"ONCE WERE WARRIORS is a gem of a movie that received little play in the United States.  And that is a shame since this film is one of the most brutal and unforgettable exposes of the disintegration of a native culture after debilitating contact with a colonially suffocating one.  Director Lee Tomahori presents a poverty-stricken subculture of the Maori tribe in New Zealand, one in which the dissolution of the formerly strong tribal bonds and rituals becomes increasingly evident in each scene.  Part of the appeal of this movie is that the theme of cultural sabotage is often repeated in many cultures--and not just in third world cultures that accept Burger King rather than their own gods as a worthy pantheon.
Temuera Morrison is Jake, a brute of a husband who finds that his place in society has been undercut by a Western civilization that seems bent on putting Guess jeans on all the natives.  Jake finds it difficult to hold a job so he spends his days drinking in pubs with his mates.  He brawls, he drinks, he abuses his long suffering wife Beth (Rena Owen) whenever his self-esteem dips below a critical level.  Beth tries hard to maintain some semblance of normalcy, but with one son in prison, another seeking to join a gang, and a teenage daughter trying to face the issues of her own burgeoning sexuality in a male-dominant society, she finds this job impossible.  She loves Jake, but she hates what he has become, and there is no easy solution.
Nearly all the major characters are blighted in some way by their inability to adjust to their newer and low-class status in a Western culture than relegates their own to disrepute.  Much of the film is filled with the raw violence of bar room brawls, ugly scenes of domestic abuse, and rape.  All of this violence serves to underscore the need of a disenfranchised people to look within themselves to find the pride and respect that once marked them as warriors.  Most fail, but the few who do not suggest that the recovery of basic human decency transcends cultures and borders so that any who see this marvelous movie can take heart that brutes like Jake are dinosaurs, eventually to be replaced by adaptable survivors like Beth.  The closing scene of Beth's son,now fully engaged in his gang's ritualistic dance of discipline, punctuates this most basic of human desires.",1050969600,6,2339,4.764851485148514
694208,5,630358490X,"This is an amazing film on several fronts. First, it gives a bleak, but accurate view of modern life for the native Maori people of New Zealand. Next, it explores the desperate life of a low income, abusive family who could exist in any country. For an American it is a cultural awakening to the oppressed life of the aboriginal culture of New Zealand and what it has been reduced to in modern times. There are powerful scenes of a population striving to maintain some grip on its ancient traditions, contrasted with modern ""ghetto life."" It should ring very clear as being similar to our own native Americans and their plight in our own country. Along with this the film brings a vivid portrait of a family struggling with less than easy socio-economical situations and the typical downfalls it presents- alcoholism, drug use and domestic violence.  The climax presents a heart-wrenching scene I can only compare with the rape scene from The Accused. It is burned in my mind, and will forever haunt me in the same way the pinball machine scene from The Accused did.
 Again, this film has so much to offer on so many levels: powerful performances (many from ""non-actors""), a new cultural awareness, and a bleak portrait of the lives of a poverty-ridden society attempting to cling to some aspect of it history. DO see this film. You will be glad you did.",1048550400,,1354,4.708860759493671
694209,3,630358490X,"Whopper of a movie centralized around a Maori mother and daughter dealing with the abusive, mixed blood male figure in their life, an impressive Temuera Morrison. With its comparitively alien (at least for a white guy from Chicago) setting and culture, you would think a movie like this would be impenetrable to anyone outside of New Zealand, but director Tamahori deals in a universal, familiar story without giving us something we've seen before. The acting is fantastic all around, from the lovely and inspiring Rena Owen to the astounding physical and emotional presence of Temeura Morrison as Jake. The way Beth ultimately uses Jake as a tool of her own outrage is something to see, though a tad expected. This really is a great and unflinching portrayal of the tragedy of the battered home. It could have wallowed in the excessive Ricki Lake freakshow element, or come off as relentlessly depressing, but in the end, like Beth, it stands up and lifts its head.",1047340800,,966,4.896341463414634
694210,4,630358490X,"but ""once were warriors"" will keep you enthralled with it's powerhouse performances and it's stark reality.  Watching this is like watching real life, which in this case, is a very sad life indeed.
Enter Jake, a violent, manipulative (fill in the blank)that has his family's fate controlled by his behavior.  He beats his wife to a bloody pulp.  He drinks his days away after being laid off, and money appears in his hands from out of nowhere.  This is not exactly the ""father of the year"" nor ""husband of the year"" for that matter.  His wife, along with the rest of the women in the story start off seeming submissive but by the end things change, for the worst in one way. But in another, it is good.  The wife finally takes her survival tactics and her fierce determination for a better life for both her and her children, and leaves her husband.  They go home to her tribe/family known as Maori, who were once warriors...
I recommend it, but get out the tissues.  It's a real sad look into the lives of a family living with an abusive and downright mean patriarch.",1046736000,3,1068,4.4974093264248705
694211,5,630358490X,"I fell deeply sorry for anyone who must put up with whats sounds like an absolutely terrible DVD transfer of the film. If anyone comes to New Zealand, you can pick up a perfect widescreen, 5.1 Dolby Digital version with features such as cast interviews, music videos, trailers, Director's commentry and no annoying subtitles. Once Were Warriors tells a story that can be translated into any language yet have the same impact. Domestic violence is the topic of this brutal film from acclaimed New Zealand director Lee Tamahori. Considering I come from New Zealand myself, I can not get the point across strongly enough that New Zealand is a beautiful country and the scenes in the film only portrayed a small portion of how NZ was in 1995 when the movie was set. For a real view on how my country is, take a look at the scenery of 'The Lord Of The Rings' from another visionary NZ director, Peter Jackson.
Once Were Warriors follows a Maori family living at the bottom of the economic pool. There is Beth, the mother of four children. The eldest son Nick, has become estranged from the family and joined a gang because of his hatred for his abusive father, Jake. Next is the smart and beautiful 13 year old Grace stuck in a life that is far from fit for her. Mark, the second eldest boy has made friends with local thieves and spends most of his time on the streets, so he gets sent off to Social Welfare. The youngest boy gets the least screen time of the children.
Temuera Morrison's portrayal of 'Jake the Muss' is done with fire in his eyes. Originally it was believed that he was not right for the part, but he proved them wrong. His acting and Rena Owen's (Beth) pushed the boundaries of acting and reality. The film came away with 12 International Awards. To tell you the truth, it should be been given Oscars. Another star who should not go without credit is Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell who plays Grace. She did an amazing job for her first acting role.
Well worth buying this film. It will shock you no matter how many times it is viewed, but in a good way that makes you think. >Enjoy<",1039132800,12,2088,4.482939632545932

694333,5,630358490X,"Considering the millions of dollars that are poured into Hollywood films these days its amazing that a film that couldn't have cost much to make, has such an incredible impact. Once Were Warriors relies on emotion and very human situations and not special effects to hold your attention;and does it hold it. I've never seen a movie that at times can be so disturbing but at others so uplifting. What makes this movie special to me is the way the family goes through such tragedy and how they pull together, especially the mother who finally has the strength to get away from the destructive forces in her and her childrens lives. This is a movie that you will think about for days afterward and if you can get through the ugly parts it is truly a great film.",1028937600,3,758,4.5
694334,5,630358490X,"I suspect many Americans/Europeans will only discover this film because of Temuera Morrison's role as Jango Fett in ""Star Wars II - Attack of the Clones"". But I'm happy for that, as this is, without a doubt, one of the FINEST FILMS EVER MADE. Now that's a bold claim, but I'll stand by it. It's not fun or ""enjoyable"" (in the traditional sense), but it is an absolute masterpiece.
It's definitely not a ""first date"" movie, in fact one major newspaper called it ""A relentless sledgehammer of a film"". With its central themes of cultural displacement, domestic violence and the struggle for human dignity, the actors handle their incredibly difficult roles with the utmost skill. It was probably the film that put New Zealand on the global film-world map.
Several other reviews give an outline of the plot so let me just say this - you will never forget seeing it.",1023840000,4,862,4.71523178807947

694336,5,630358490X,This movie was great.  Jake was the bad guy that you wanted to have sympathy for.  But everytime you did he would screw up.  Great drama in dealing with the lower class society problems.  Beth is a strong woman trying to raise her family right but always has unbearable obstacles.  the intensity of this movie is awsome.

694337,5,630358490X,"Being an American living in New Zealand I saw this movie before I moved here and loved it, but now that I live here I love this movie even more. It is an excellant portrayal of the lives of a Maori family and the troubles they face. Highly recomended along with the sequel What Becomes the Broken Hearted",1021420800,2,304,4.258620689655173
694338,4,630358490X,"While much of the tribal allegory was lost on me as I am not familar with the New Zealand social environment, I was directed to this film by a friend who acts as a counselor for men who abuse their families. I noted that the alien nature of this film, the social aspects being slightly different, the language (It's choice, really choice.) might help American men to reflect on the film's domestic violence more readily. My councelor friend said this is exactly what happens. They feel the film is distant from themselves, so they begin to analyze what is happening. The counselor can then draw parallels between their statements and their realities.
One comment the men have is that the main character ""beats his wife as you would a man."" The film features a bar brawl scene followed by a domestic violence scene. The men in counseling comment that a woman should not be hit with fists, but with an open hand if she is hit. The counselor is then able to point out the conflict in what the men have just said. A woman should NOT BE HIT at ALL!!!
Moreover, this movie is not particularly realistic, because the woman is a strong character, stands up to her husband and eventually leaves him. Which is not really the norm for American domestic violence. It is, nonetheless, an effective instrument of inspiring discussion among people who are involved in domestic violence and/or dysfunctional families.",1017705600,3,1401,4.745901639344262

Everyone in this cast was brilliant and indeed, this film deserves much kudos. Violent, brutal, sensual, and uncompromising.

The story revolves around and her family as they struggle with things like poverty, alcohalism, heritage and racism. The movie is interesting to see because you realize how much of a global struggle racism and discrimination are.",1013040000,,367,4.841269841269841
694341,5,630358490X,"The subject matter is universal, as much as we may hate to admit it: spousal abuse, rape, gang activity, unempolyment, alcoholism, and so on. We can all relate. I know many women who struggle like Beth to have a decent home for their children despite near poverty. I know many men like Jake whose own worth as a man is questioned by losing a job, and who turn to violence to feel a semblance of control. I know many children who fall prey to the dangers of living in such a volatile environment. And I know many families for whom it takes a profound tragedy to illicit positive change.
We could all learn a lesson from this movie. The most important things in life are not the things we can buy, but the ways in which we treat one another. And we should always embrace our culture. In the ways of our forefathers, we find the strength to perservere through our own lives. Times change, but strength is always there.",1011571200,,915,4.3882352941176475
694342,5,630358490X,"This was a simple yet powerful film.  I had to ask myself why I had not heard more about it several years ago.  One is initially struck by the quality of the acting.  Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison are naturals.  You are immediately drawn into their struggles.  These struggles go beyond family conflict and provide a beautiful contrast between their rich cultural history and poor living conditions.
The only caution I would give regarding this film is that it is not for the faint of heart.  It is very intense and violent at times.  But it is also depicts the great caring shown by the characters.  That is what makes it so believable.",1009324800,,638,4.584070796460177

694496,5,630358490X,"Set in New Zealand, this excellent film portrays a small urban subculture of disenfranchized Maori, focusing on one disfunctional family.  All the characters are compelling.  There's Jake, the hard-drinking, brawling husband, always bitterly aware that he comes from a long line of slaves.  And Beth, his full-blooded Maori wife, from a royal tribal line.  Their sons: Boogie, ward of the court and sentenced to a Maori-centric boys' home; and Nig, prospecting for membership in an urban tribal gang.  There's Grace, their sensitive 13-year-old daughter, who writes fanciful stories for her younger siblings and a homeless boy who lives in a car.  And there are Jake's party-buddies, his beloved extended ""family"" -- ""uncles"" to his kids.  The accents, ethnic traditions, martial arts, and particularly the facial tattooing of the Toa will appear ""exotic"" to the American audience. But the alcoholism, unemployment, domestic violence, teen delinquency, and child abuse are themes common anywhere. These subjects are presented with compassion.  You'll come to genuinely care for all the characters.  Even for Jake who, despite his brutality, is a tragic human being.  I highly recommend ""Once Were Warriors"".

Jake is so scary that you will hate him and feel sorry for him.  Out of my top ten list of favorite films, Once Were Warriors is Number 1 on my list.

The sons, meanwhile, have either joined gangs or are involved in skirmishes with the local authorities. The daughter's talent at writing and reading, the only ray of hope in a devastated family, passes unacknowledged by those around her until she decides to take her future into her own hands...There are no attempts here to couch the violence in Tarantino-esque post-modern designer chic, just a truly honest and brutally unflinching account of a community with their backs against the wall.

The power of the movie is that it transcends its location while at the same time giving a very powerful rendition of the anguish and oh so complicated mana of what it means to be Maori, urban and poor in New Zealand today.
Of course, not all South Aucklanders live like this and of course not all Maori are urban, underclass and alienated from their heritage.  Nevertheless, this is a faithful evocation of the awful situations that some of our people have to deal with.  I say ""our"" because although I am not tangata whenua myself, we all (all New Zealanders) bear some responsibility for the legacy of colonialism that Tamahori so elegantly suggests in this movie. Beth's interaction with the smirking white cops in the opening minutes of the movie is a truly marvellous example of this.
This is where Tamahori's movie is actually a very different vision of urban Maori culture and New Zealand society as a whole from that provided by the novel by the Maori academic Alan Duff (Once Were Warriors, Univ. of Hawai`i Press) on which the movie is based.  Duff equates the effect of white supremacy in NZ to a storm:  ""Do I accuse the storm that destroys my crops?  No I [do not]..., I clean up and then I PLANT AGAIN"".
Tamahori places the historical responsibility where it truly lies and portrays urban Maori in a more sympathetic and humane light. Duff however parcels out blame heavily on his own people. In his (dare we say bourgeois?) insistence that poor urban Maori are a bookless people who are doomed to redundancy, viciousness and poverty if they do not shake off their own self-pity, and improve themselves, Duff comes perilously close to the self-promoting ""I hauled mesself up by me own boot-straps"" argument so beloved by right-wing settlers, immigrants and self-made men.
What makes OWW such a great film is that it looks the issues (and yes, the responsibilities for domestic abuse, alcoholism and violence) firmly in the eye and yet allows the people in the community the right to stand for themselves.  If I had to choose between Alan Duff and Lee Tamahori, I would choose Tamahori's vision as the more nuanced, complex and ultimately righteous.  Kia ora, bro'.",988588800,3,2443,4.756501182033097

694866,5,630358490X,"This film is not for the faint hearted or squeamish.  It is brutal, cruel, and downright violent, especially in its portrayal of domestic abuse.  Rena Owen gives a superb performance as the wife of a habitually violent husband  who turns a blind eye to her man's inability to control his temper or  provide for his family.  However her world is steadily crumbling around her  ears, and tragic change is in the air.  Her family is disintegrating.  One  of her son's is already in prison; the other is about to join a gang.  Her  eldest daughter Grace is a gifted young woman but the atmosphere at home is  crippling her, and she is soon to be victim of a vicious assault by a  friend of her father's.  Unable to cope the young girl commits suicide but  she leaves a record of the assault in her diary. And in doing so sets off a  chain of events that will result in her mother striking out and turning her  back on a life of abuse that she and her children have suffered for so  long.  This is a film about a family at war with itself and within society.  Set in New Zealand with a mainly Maori cast it shows life at its rawest  and most debased, but all the time hope shines through, and a young woman  remembers when her people ""once were warriors"" and not just the  dregs of an indifferent society.  Despite the violence this film is  beautifully crafted, well written and totally believable.  Hold your breath  for the scene when Grace's father goes on the rampage, it has to be seen to  be believed.

694867,4,630358490X,"Being a kiwi any comment i say hereafter may be taken with a grain of salt so be warned. Make no mistake this is a superbly crafted domestic drama of which all involved have done themselves proud. A sad homily of domestic  violence and brutality too often prevalent in the ghettoes & slums of  our worlds major cities. In this case set in south Auckland, NZ. The anti  hero Jake is married to the loyal and long suffering Beth. They have two  sons, who are well on their way to emulating their fathers exploits and a  daughter, the gentle Grace who is literate and innocent. One senses that  Jake is a good and decent man with an honour code of his own. That in an  idealistic world he would do the right thing by his family and prove  himself a worthy role model for his children. Unfortunately his drunken  binges fill him with irrational rages which he takes out in graphic  violence upon his family and especially Beth his long suffering partner.  Blame it on the alcohol, the working class poverty, cultural brainwashing  or what have you. It is all endemic of a cycle of violence which for Jake  and Beth ends one night with a catalytic tragedy of his own making. Life  will never be the same. Enough said.
Outsiders perhaps should be aware  that though the violence depicted in this film is not indicative of the  majority of maori families in this country the statistics show that it is  prevalent enough to figure significantly elsewhere in our courts, jails and  psychiatric institutions. Alan Duff writes a good script here giving all  the best lines to Beth played with grittty realism by Rena Owen.

(Note:  Temeura Morrison later stated that he was ""scarred"" for quite a while emotionally and mentally after  playing Jake.)

At first I was  unwilling to see another film dealing with the subject, especially since I  the results of domestic violence almost daily on my job.  Now I say that if  you watch only one film on the matter in your life, make it this one.  For  an American viewer, the fact that all the action takes place in Auckland,  New Zealand helps give the distance needed for an honest perspective on the  theme.  Then the highly skilled actors (may we see more of all of  them!)play the story out as it happens to thousands of families all over  the world, totally stripping domestic violence of any excuse to be.  By the  heart-rending and horrific end of the movie there can be no doubt in  anyone's mind that neither substance abuse, cultural conditioning,  disenfranchised cultures, poverty nor a host of other things often invoked  as ""reasons"" justify turning one's household into a war zone.  Most family violence perpetrators are not hardcore psychopaths; they are  ""Jakes"", and they have no excuse for what they do to their  families.  A beautiful film that makes its point without resulting to  melodrama and sensationalism.

7851931,5,630358490X,"From the sly opening sequence to very last frame of Jake, alone and broken, ""Once Were Warriors"" doesn't let up. Emotional reactions come hard and fast; it's impossible not to hit the pause button at least once for a quick time-out. Bloody bar fights, domestic violence, rape...this is without a doubt the most brutal film I've ever seen, and the saddest. When that jarring guitar assault signals the end of the film, I defy any viewer not to feel pole-axed.

Jake Heke--or Jake the Muss to his friends--is a tough guy. Pour enough beer into him and he's take on all comers, including his wife and kids, and beat them senseless.  Jake is descended from the world's fiercest fighters, but by 1990, those who once were warriors were on the dole, drinking themselves stupid on cheap beer and following the usual trajectory of aboriginal people when their society is unraveled and replaced by a force feeding of Western religion and Western contempt in equal doses.

Temuera Morrison, a former New Zealand soap opera heart throb, is responsible for much of the heart and soul of the film.  He gives such a nuanced performance, we're forced to understand -- almost to forgive -- Jake's kneejerk savagery. One minute we're repulsed and the next we want to cry for this poor, shattered soul. Jake's wife, Beth, beautifully played by Rena Owens, is from a higher caste and more tied to her Maori roots...but over the years, Jake has beaten her ""manna"" -- her spirit -- out of her.

Jake's sons, ironically, find their own ways back to some semblance of Maori culture. Eldest son Nig wears his street gang's ta moko--facial tattoos--like the old warriors. In the same way that Japanese Yakuda resurrected Samuria elements, although in a corrupted manner, into their rituals, Maori gangbangers weave parts of their past into new traditions. Second son Boog ends up in a reform school run by a teacher who shows his charges how to ""wear their tattoos on the inside.""

For all their fierceness, it's not the men in this film who are the real warriors. It's Jake's wife, a woman born with warrior DNA, who prevails in the end and finds the strength to effect a change for her family. But most of all, it's Grace, the eldest daughter, who holds things together, who helps Beth when Jake beats her half to death, who picks up the pieces when her parents' drinking or battling leave things in chaos. Grace writes poetry and dreams of a life where drinking and hitting or being hit aren't the only reality. She protects the younger kids from the worst of Jake's temper, giving them their only haven in a home defined by drunken parties, drunken sex, drunken beatings.  It's around her that the tragedy that is the heart and catalyst of ""Once Were Warriors"" revolves.

The beatings Jake dishes out are hard to watch, but are as essential to the reality and impact of the film, as they are to his character. Brutality is his only means of self-expression. A warrior without a cause, he's proving his manhood by punching his wife unconscious at home and busting skulls at the saloon. Jake the Muss is such an iconic figure, and Morrison's portrayal is so human and moving, we're forced to look past the violence. Jake is the character who ultimately breaks your heart in this heartbreaking movie.

""Once Were Warriors"" is unforgettable.

(The Alan Duff novel ""Once Were Warriors"" on which the movie is based is excellent. The film contains a dramatic plot change. I saw the film first...I don't know whether reading the book first would have changed my perceptions of the film. Duff's other books about Maori subculture are equally good, particularly ""One Night Out Stealing.""  There are several sequels to the film version of ""Once Were Warriors,"" none of them equal to the original and none worth watching.)",1277078400,,3789,4.7782874617737

7851933,5,630358490X,"I'm from the country this movie was made, New Zealand, and I've got to say, this movie changed the way I viewed New Zealand and is changing me in a way. I can relate to a lot of things to the people in this movie as my pops use to beat on my moms a lot when I was younger. To me, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen and witnessed. The power in this movie is so mighty, you wouldn't even believe it.

It's not about any Maori family but families world-wide living in the struggle. I, at one point, was in that position and that's one of the reasons why I'm so in love with this movie. I can understand the pain and anger these kids had to go through as I was in the exact same position. Temuera Morrison isn't the character that you'd expect to be played Jake. But the amount of energy and effort he puts into this tells everyone that anyone can do it. His role at Jake 'The Muss' is one of the best I've seen. He puts so much energy into this character that it makes people hate on the character himself.

For those who don't know the story, this is about a woman's fight for survival. Rena Owen, playing Beth Heke, is absolutely great. Beth is married to Jake 'The Muss', a ruthless fighter who has nothing to lose. Even though she gets the beats from Jake and doesn't get any support whatsoever, her love for her still stands strong. Surviving with a monster like Jake for 18 years is what I call 'guts'. This woman is hard, even harder than Jake himself. Hardly any woman would survive with a husband beating on her or cursing her most nights. Beth was different, she had a special power in her that would put her up with this. But not only her was she living through the pain, the kids too. With 5 kids, Grace and Boogie felt the most pain as they were growing up. When Beth finally realizes what is happening in life, she finally takes the right lane and cruises down it.

Lee Tamahori, who also directed the latest James Bond movie, is superb. I don't know how he did it but he did and it turned out to be a classic. The acting is far beyond superb, I wouldn't even know how to rate the acting as there's no word to describe it. It touches deep in the heart to anyone and makes everyone think hard deep into life.

As I've said before, it's changed the way about how I view New Zealand. I use to hate living in this country but now, I'm proud that I was born here and I'm proud that I was raised here. I thought New Zealand wasn't jacksh*t without the major producing companies but now I can finally see that any country can do it, no matter how well known they are.

This movie is honestly one of the best I've seen, I can honestly say this is the most powerful movie I've seen (well, for me as I've witnessed mostly everything in this movie) but I'd have to recommend it to anyone. It contains a lot of violence in this but its for a reason.",1097971200,4,2859,4.134892086330935
7851934,5,630358490X,"In a film so hard-hitting that the viewer actually feels battered by the time it reaches its conclusion, a Maori family with five children must deal with urban violence, poverty, drugs, alcoholism, unemployment, gang warfare, rape, physical and mental abuse, suicide, and a host of other horrific family problems, all shown graphically. Beth and Jake Heke and their five children, along with numerous other Maori families, live in an urban ghetto of government-supported housing, isolated from the rest of society and isolated, too, from their old rural culture, which once gave pride and a sense of identity to Maori families. Here in the city the prevailing ""culture"" centers around bars, rather than the ancient meeting houses.

Beth Heke (Rena Owen), the mother, loves her violent husband Jake (Temuera Morrison), despite his abuse of her when he is drunk, and she cares deeply about her children, but she is powerless to protect them or herself from Jake's rages. The oldest son (Julian Arahanga) is part of a street gang which covers their faces in traditional tattoos and uses their own violence for protection against others. Their sensitive second son Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) has been arrested for associating with car thieves. Most touching, however, is Gracie (unforgettably played by Mamaengaroa Kerr-Bell), a thirteen-year-old beauty who is trying to lead a good life without any good examples to follow. Pathetically, she and the two youngest children are forced to ""grow up early,"" accepting the horrors of their lives as ""normal,"" while they try to survive any way they can.

The bold, raw language of Alan Duff's novel of the same name becomes part of Riwia Brown's script, and Lee Tamahori's direction brings this powerful, absorbing, and overwhelming story of human misery to life. Tamahori uses contrasts throughout to emphasize the themes and the differences between contemporary Maori urban life and traditional Maori culture. He uses haunting Maori music to begin the film, then switches to scenes of rap and rock, he alternates quiet visions of a Maori village with loud bar activity, he shows the sweetness of Gracie against the grim living conditions of her best friend Toot (Shannon Williams), and illustrates throughout Jake's violence in contrast to the family's need for calmer, more focused lives. The cinematography, too, emphasizes the contrasts, though most viewers will be too focused on the overwhelming emotionalism of the scenes to notice. Though I loved the book, I found the film even better--the characters as acted here are much more heart-wrenching than I ever could have imagined. Mary Whipple",1092009600,10,2638,5.248815165876778

7851936,5,630358490X,"Graphic violence, in movies such as `Once Were Warriors' and Stanley Kubrick's `A Clockwork Orange', is not gratuitous. Violence in art does serve a purpose: to educate, to shock, to raise awareness and to repulse.
In this screen adaptation of Alan Duff's novel of the same title, the pub brawls, wife beatings and gang fights serve to drive home one point: Violence exists in society, and violence kills and destroys. Violence is not glamorous, but a sign that rot has set in within a family or community. The violent scenes in `Once Were Warriors' is terrifying, raw and difficult to stomach because we know it can happen anywhere in the world, and it does happen, in our own communities and backyards.
`Once Were Warriors' revolves around a Maori family, Jake and Beth being the parents of five children. As with almost all groups that is low on the socioeconomic scale, alcoholism and domestic violence is a problem. Limited educational and job opportunities are not problems faced exclusively by the Maori but also all marginalized communities. Even reverse discrimination policies have failed to ensure equal treatment and respect for the minorities. Alcoholism becomes a problem for men when, by virtue of being treated as second-class citizens, their self-esteem and sense of cultural pride are repeatedly destroyed.
For our central characters Jake and Beth, life is a struggle to survive from paycheck to paycheck. Jake is horrendously strong and masculine, but also self-absorbed, irresponsible and volatile. Beth, like many women without careers or sources of income of their own, alternates between feeling bitter over her helplessness to provide her children with a better life and feeling pride that she is the wife of the virile and strong Jake.
As every student of behaviorism and behavior training would know, abusive relationships feed on and are sustained by the abuse because the occasional positive reinforcement persuades the abused party that things are not always all that bad and things would be better soon (E.g. read Karen Pryor's behavioral training classic, `Don't Shoot The Dog'). Jake's rare moments of generosity and tenderness towards Beth convinces her that she is better off living with him, and that leaving Jake would just leave her vulnerable to other problems and abuses. She is battered, then apologized to, then pacified by Jake with displays of affection and declarations of love. This is the reason why most domestic violence victims often take so long to seek external help: Their assumption is that the abuser genuinely loves them, but `just has a problem with his temper' and the situation will improve `once he finds a job/is out of debt/once they have a bit of money'.
We are presented with a violent scene where Jake beats up another man in a pub for playing the jukebox too loudly. We, the audience, gasp at his strength and lack of remorse. Later, we see Jake confronting Beth for talking back and refusing to do as she is told. Jake unleashes his fury on her, beating her so badly that she is unable to go to court the following morning for the hearing of her juvenile delinquent son, Boogie. We understand that Beth seems to have accepted the beatings as a normal part of relationships.
Of the Heke children, Nig, the eldest, has left home to join a gang. His gang initiation ceremony involves him being beaten up by about ten older gang members. Boogie, the second son, has been `running around with the wrong crowd' and is soon placed in a juvenile detention center, where he learns self-discipline, self-respect, love and respect for his culture and `to wear his taiaha inside' when he is angry. The taiaha imagery here is important as it can be interpreted as a symbol of Maori pride and courage.
Gracie, Jake and Beth's 13-year-old daughter, deserves better than the cesspool of a home she was brought up in. She is kind to the point of overwhelming magnanimity and nurturing to a fault, but her potential is stifled by lack of support and understanding from her parents. Still, Gracie shows the most promise of all the Heke children. Her untimely demise later in the film is a great source of sorrow and resentment for me.
A scene in the later part of the movie shows Jake refusing to hand over the keys to the car to Beth. Again, this is a powerful artistic device to let us see how helpless and trapped Beth is in her marriage to Jake. She can't leave even if she is determined to, she has nowhere to go and she can afford to only go home.
Despite the bleakness of all that has befallen the Heke family; the beatings sustained by Beth and Nig, Jake's revelation that he came `from a long line of slaves' and was not considered good enough for Beth's family, the detention of Boogie and the rape and subsequent suicide of young Gracie, this movie does provide us with achingly beautiful glimpses into the New Zealand urban landscape and Maori culture. When the village elders performed the Haere Mai welcoming song to welcome Beth and her brood back into the folds of their close-knit community, I believe not many of us can help but feel emotional. Beth turns to her Maori roots to give her strength at a time when she needs it the most, and her people and culture do not forsake her but fortify her instead and help her walk away from the destructive forces that strive to break her spirit and tear her family apart.
The entire cast has given nothing but the best to make this movie the powerful social commentary that it is. The compelling performance by the cast enables us to empathize with the problems and predicaments faced by the Maori as well as so many other marginalized groups. `Once Were Warriors' is essential watching to anyone who hopes to understand the problems connected with domestic violence, working class society and the effect of imposing a global monoculture on people who already have a culture and religion of their own. While I do not pretend that this movie is able to address all those issues exhaustively, it does help us see things from one family's perspective. And sometimes that's enough.",1069113600,7,6084,4.822966507177034
