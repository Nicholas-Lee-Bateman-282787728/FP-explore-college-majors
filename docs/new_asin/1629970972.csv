7801198,5,1629970972,"I have been fascinated by how much we have learned in the last 25 years about the universe we live in. While I have watched most of the mainstream programs dedicated to this subject I wanted to delve deeper into this subject. When I saw this course, among others, available on The Great Courses Plus I signed up for a free trial. What I love about this course is that not only do you get a good survey of the subject the Professor explains some of the methodology behind how the Scientists come to the theories and hypotheses about what the Universe is made of and how the Universe is structured in an easy to understand way. Each lecture is focused around one key Celestial Object and the lectures are set up that one leads into the other with the student slowly getting a comprehensive overall of both the subject matter and the methodology of this science. I have listened or watched more then a dozen Great Courses lecture series over the years and I have found them to be all to be good to very good. This one is one of the best courses I have partaking in and highly recomeneded this to anybody interested in this Subject.",1489622400,,1128,4.401913875598086
