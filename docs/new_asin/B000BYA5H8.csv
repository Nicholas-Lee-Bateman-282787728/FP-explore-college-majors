Small snippets of interviews with Ridgeway and the title are the only connection to the actual case.

This might very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. Actually, calling it a movie would be giving it more credit than it deserves.  It's a shame because this subject matter would have been a great background for a better writer and director to explore.  However, it plays out like a poorly acted episode of America's Most Wanted.

I have never reviewed a motion picture without seeing it in its entirety. However, this time i'll make an exception. 40 minutes and that was it. Junk. No thrills, horror, or drama. Just a lot of trash filmaking that belongs in some vague ""worst film"" category.

  If the theme of this film was to show the inner workings of a serial killer then it could have been done quite effectively without lenghty torturous scenes that leave nothing to the imagination.

2445786,1,B000BYA5H8,"I will preface this by saying that I am a True Crime fan, and that Ann Rule's ""Green River Running Red"" was one of the first books that got me into True Crime, and remains one of my favorites to this day. I saw this movie in the video store after having read and enjoyed ""Green River Running Red,"" and having seen parts of the Lifetime film starring Tom Cavanaugh. I had never heard of this one, or of its director, but I knew a lot about, and was interested in, the case of Gary Ridgeway and his crimes, so I decided to give it a try.

I was not excepting this to be an Oscar-worthy film, but rather a mediocre, made-for-TV caliber film, telling the story but taking some small liberties, as the other movie about this story had been. But boy was I wrong. I was disappointed to see the first real scene of the story taking place in a bar, showing Ridgeway seducing a seemingly intoxicated woman in her mid 20s who was dancing in the bar, when anyone who is at all familiar with the case knows that Ridgeway picked up down on their luck teenage prostitutes in his truck along the Sea Tac strip. I made it through the scene where he brings this ""prostitute,"" who seems more like a barfly who was all too happy to accompany him home for a romp, paid for or not, home. Then, after stashing his young son alone in another room, proceeds to have sex with and kill her in what I could best describe as a sleezy, badly written, pornographic montage, that was obviously meant to try to arouse the viewer. After that I had seen enough, and turned the DVD off.

Had this been purely a work of fiction, I'd have chalked it up to a badly written, directed, and acted, soft-core porn film, and might have even continued watching it, to amuse myself with how bad it was. But since it was supposed to be loosely based on true events, events of which it seemed to completely ignore the facts, I was incensed. I found this to be incredibly disrespectful and exploitative of the victims and their families, and even of Ridgeway's son. I pity anyone who actually wasted their money buying this film, and think that the director and producers of this rubbish are severely disturbed. I agree with those who said that, if it were an option, I'd have given it a big fat zero. Don't waste your time or money on this.",1325635200,,2292,4.3279069767441865
2445787,1,B000BYA5H8,"The first thing I'm going to say is that if you have any interest in this topic, spend your money on ""The Hunt for the Green River Killer"" movie that ran on Lifetime.  That movie is much longer, but it was excellent.  It also sparked my interest further in the topic and led me to purchase this movie.  The first few minutes into this movie I lost interest.  The acting is so bad that it seems they hired out-of-work porn actors to do this film.  Actually, the acting was even worse than that.  The ladies in the movie are alot older than the ones I remember reading about associated with the Green River killings.  Although the killer himself has the creepy intensity, it's almost to a point where it reads corny and not believable.  He keeps frequenting this one bar and picking up ladies to murder.  The movie itself lacks that documentary feel where you feel as if you are watching something unfold.  It has more of that ""TV show"" type feel which doesn't help its impact.  I guess I'm pretty big on facts and the portrayal of those facts.  Green River Killer gets a ""D"" on both.  The sexual situations are more skanky than scary.

2445810,1,B000BYA5H8,"This is a disastrously bad, ridiculous excuse of a film.  You would think the life and crimes of a man who killed dozens and dozens of women over the course of two decades would be interesting enough for any director, but Ulli Lommel threw accuracy out of the window whenever he felt like it (either that, or he couldn't even be bothered in the first place to do a Google search for Green River Killer).  Based on what I saw here, all Lommel knows about these infamous crimes is that some fellow named Gary Ridgway killed a bunch of prostitutes in the Seattle area in the 1970s.  I'm not talking about the kind of problems that can be blamed on a low budget here; Lommel either didn't know or just didn't care about the facts.

In the movie, Ridgway picks up all of his prostitutes at this tiny bar, leading each girl out in front of the same group of people time and time again.  Even when it finally dawns on the bar owner that this same weird dude left with all of her working girls right before they died or went missing, and she mentions it to the police (who seemingly don't care that she's a madam), Ridgway keeps on doing it - and no one seems to be the wiser.  Anyone of these regular bar patrons could have identified the killer, no matter how much beer poured through their bloodstreams.  Then there's Ridgway's job.  In real life, he did detailed custom painting at a trucking plant; in the movie, all he does is move boxes at some warehouse.  It's hilarious, really; he and his two co-workers literally pick up boxes and move them from one stack to an adjacent stack over and over again.  Then you have one scene showing Ridgway killing a prostitute in his house while his obviously troubled young son is in the other room.  That never happened in real life, and I find it quite odious that Lommel would take such offensive liberties with this unfortunate boy.  And don't even get me started with the salacious little tidbit Lommel chose to throw in at the very end.  This man obviously has no shame.

Lommel isn't even talented enough to be an amateur filmmaker, in my opinion.  Green River Killer is a disgraceful, incompetent film in every possible way.  If you're going to exploit the victims of an inhuman serial killer for profit, at least show them or the audience a little respect.",1251590400,,2302,4.471291866028708
2445811,1,B000BYA5H8,"Honestly, should I ever again see a movie with Ulli Lommel's name attached to it I'll pass.  I purchased this movie and two other films from this person and have never seen movies this bad.  Amature filming, amature acting, retarded plodding plots.  Nonsensical direction.  A&E did a movie titled ""The Riverman"" which was way better than this schlock.  Don't waste your money on Lommel's films.  Of the three I purchased I watched 3/4 of The Green River Killer, maybe 1/4 of Black Dahlia, and I'm not even going to bother with The Zodiac Killer.

2445812,3,B000BYA5H8,"The Green River Killer is another in a series of films either based upon or loosely based upon famous serial killers.  Ulli Lommel's take upon The Green River Killer is interesting.  He uses the digital camera quite well and it reminds me of a documentary in spots as well go for ride arounds with the killer and a personal view of his home and work life.  The murders are sick and they're supposed to be.  Whoever said murder wasn't?  We also have to keep in mind how this man was a twisted and cruel individual.  The commentary is quite interesting I recommend listening to Ulli Lommel talk about his experiences with cinema and a few helpful tips about filmmaking.

For those who critic his work, that's fine.  We all have an opinion, but to say ""I can do better with a couple of bucks and camera"" is nonsense.",1233187200,,813,4.445945945945946

2445814,4,B000BYA5H8,"He's one of the most prolific, efficient, and all-but-uncatchable serial killers the world has ever produced, yet I daresay most people outside of the Pacific Northwest would not even recognize the name Gary Ridgway.  I find that incredibly odd because this man was far more successful at his evil deeds than even John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy.  I became fascinated with the ""Green River Killer"" back in the mid-80s after stumbling upon a book about the killings.  As a young teenager at the time, I was completely unfamiliar with the murders up until that point, so I remember being shocked by the sheer number of bodies being brought out of that Green River location.  The investigation became even more interesting when an imprisoned Ted Bundy entered into the discussion - ostensibly offering the authorities his unique insight into the psychological profile of the Green River Killer (although I suspect Bundy only did so as part of a multi-pronged strategy to delay his date with the executioner).

Two things make Gary Ridgway stand out among the rogues gallery of serial killers.  One is the sheer number of murders he committed - he pleaded guilty to 48 but claims to have killed some 90 victims over the course of his two-decade murder spree.  The second is the fact that Ridgway was never caught in the traditional sense.  He operated for years under the noses of the 50-man Green River Task Force, leaving no evidence that police could use to tie him to the crimes.  Were it not for the modern-day development and advancement of DNA analysis, which linked Ridgway to at least four of the Green River victims, I don't believe justice would ever have come knocking on his door.  Authorities claim he was a strong suspect as early as 1984, but they never had enough evidence to charge him with the murders (even after conducting a search of his house in 1987) - and that was highly unlikely to change, especially given the fact that the original 50-man Green River Task Force was down to only one man by 1992.  Some of his coworkers nicknamed him Green River Gary, but no one had evidence connecting him to any of the murders - the man had even passed a polygraph test in 1984 (presumably because Ridgway felt no guilt whatsoever for his murderous actions).

Ridgway did not fit the typical profile for a serial killer.  For one thing, he wasn't a loner - he served honorably in the Navy, maintained a steady job painting trucks at Kenworth Truck Company for 32 years, was reportedly happily married to his third wife at the time cops brought his killing spree to an end, and had one son.  Ridgway was also of below average intelligence, with an IQ of only 80 or so.  This documentary delves into his life story seeking answers as to how and why this man became America's most prolific serial killer.

This video does leave out some important information.  While it makes the point that police knew Ridgway frequented the infamous strip, it does not mention the fact that he was arrested more than once on prostitution-related charges (the last coming mere days before he was arrested for murder).  There is also no mention of Ridgway's conflicted religious beliefs.  We also don't get to hear from the killer himself - except in the form of his multiple guilty pleas in court.  Police have hundreds of hours of interview footage with Ridgway - but perhaps none of that material had been publically released at the time this documentary was made.

Frankly, I was suspicious when I first heard of Ridgway's arrest - only because authorities seemingly had next to nothing on the killer's identity after twenty years of investigation.  Clearly, though, they did get their man.  Had Ridgway not been compelled to have sex with some of his victims (both before and after - sometimes long after - their deaths), and had the authorities chosen not to preserve semen samples in hopes that DNA analysis would be developed at some later time, I daresay that Gary Ridgway would still be a free man today.  How can anyone not be fascinated by this man's story?",1212796800,,4057,4.738264580369844
2445815,5,B000BYA5H8,"This A&E original biography is  about one of the most notorious serial killers in U.S history. Gary Leon Ridgeway is ""The Green River Killer"". The film explores Ridgeway's childhood and strange,unusual and inappriopriate relationship with his overbearing mother. Factors that may have influenced Ridgeway to stalk and kill at least forty-eight victims. The victims were white and black and nearly all were prostitutes. Gary Ridgeway had an extreme amount of hatred for those kind of women. Most of the victims resorted to prostitution because they had very little education,were drug abusers or were trying to support their children in the only way they really knew how. All were desperate and had very low or no self-esteem at all. Ridgeway knew this and preyed upon these lost and desperate women. The killings started in 1982 and no one is really sure when they stopped. Gary Ridgeway was apprehended on November 30,2001. He remained free to kill for almost twenty years without being caught. Finally, DNA advancement led police to Ridgeway in 2001 and was convicted of killing forty-eight teenagers and young women between the ages of fifteen and thirty-seven. However most of the victims were in their mid to late teens and early twenties. In 2003, Gary Leon Ridgeway was sentened to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. A lot of people believed he should have gotten the death penalty, but there is no death penalty in the state of Washington where the murders took place. The families of these unfortunate victims at least have some closure and Ridgeway has been cooperative in showing police where some of the victims that police could not find where their remains are. This documentuary is chilling and provides much insight of the crimes and Gary Leon Ridgeway's highly psyhcopathic personality and his deadly compulsions. A must see for anyone who would like to know the definitive and accurate story of the man that left his first victims in Washington's Green River that dubbed him forever ""The Green River Killer"".",1207008000,,2044,5.083333333333333

I fast forwarded throught 99% of the film, I just could not believe what they did to the memory of the victims, and how horrible this would be for their families.

The movie doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity. For example, the extremely amateurish actor who plays Ridgeway doesn't match the real Ridgeway's physical description at all. The real Ridgeway was not a ""tall, handsome, muscular"" fellow. He was shorter, and unassuming-looking. Also, the majority of Ridgeway's victims were not the glamorous, seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here. They were lonely, struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the Seatac Highway.

2445833,1,B000BYA5H8,"The Green River Killer is a remarkable achievement in movie making.  It actually succeeds in making a serial killer seem dull and lifeless.  You know from the opening credits that this is an ultra-cheapo production as the killer, Gary Ridgeway rests by the bank of the Green River (which looks more like a backwoods creek) and mumbles the names of his victims.  Oh look, there's a convenient sign that reads ""Green River"" posted in the ground every time Ridgeway visits it.  Ridgeway is one of America's most notorious serial killers with an admitted body count of four dozen and perhaps more, who eluded capture in the Seattle area for some 20 years.  This film totally sucks the life out of his story with an incompetent cast, horrible dialog, and poor production values in every area.

George Kiseleff is the rank amateur in the ""starring role"", and as you can probably guess, it was his first acting credit and hopefully his last.  As Ridgeway he is shown picking up prostitutes at a local tavern and taking them either home or another location to first have sex and then strangle them before dumping their bodies into the Green River.  When Ridgeway is questioned by his wife about the strange woman coming out of their bathroom, and later about the police asking questions, he merely mumbles something incomprehensible and rolls over in bed.  That's pretty much the way he handles police questioning as well...mumbling and looking stupidly nervous until the police leave.  Were the police really that dumb?  If they were as dumb in real life as they were in this film, it's no wonder Ridgeway got away with it for 20 years.  Oh, and if you're going to have women playing prostitutes, do you think you could find one or two who are actually somewhat attractive?  These women are plain ugly.

The only positive thing about the film, other than its ending, is the inclusion of scenes of the real Ridgeway during his interrogation by the police.  At least this is the real guy talking about what he did.  I'd have much rather seen a documentary than this mess.  The DVD comes with the director's commentary but I could not bring myself to watch this putrid film a second time.

2445834,1,B000BYA5H8,"George Kiseleff stars as Gary Ridgway or The Greeennnn Rivverrrr Killeerrrr. Anyways he is married and has a son and goes out to bars, picks up some prostitutes and either brings them back to his place when his wife is gone and makes his son hide in the bathroom when he kills them or somewhere else. Then after he kills his victims he brings the bodies of the women and stashes them alongside the Green River...um, yeah. They also have actually footage of the real Ridgway sprinkled in. Also during this boring piece of crud he narrates the women's names. Gloria, Pamela, Betty, Veronica, Dolly, Molly...whatever. The acting is beyond awful and it's direction is sloppy. The writing is idiotic as well as the dialouge. It seemed like it would never end when I was watching it. I wasn't actually screaming for it to end, I was just annoyed. BLAH!!",1150934400,4,847,4.653333333333333
2445835,1,B000BYA5H8,This is a terrible movie.  I have seen cell phone video clips that have a higher production quality.  I made it through 10 minutes.  Why the hell was this movie ever made.  Larry Flint would stand up and walk away from this movie.,1150070400,4,230,4.27906976744186
2445836,1,B000BYA5H8,This movie absolutely disgusted me!  It's a hideous thinly disguised sado/masochist film.  Whoever produced the movie needs to get some help.  Way too much time was spent showing us the sexual details involved in these horrible murders as if the film maker savored the acts.  It almost seemed like a porn film.,1150070400,4,310,4.903846153846154
2445837,1,B000BYA5H8,"Gouge your eyes out before you watch this pitiful movie.  I wish I'd read the reviews *before* we wasted the [...] on it.  All it seems to be is an excuse to see [...].

There are some flaws in this movie: for example, he hands the prostitute a $10 bill and it's the ""new"" money that we got last year or something...but it's supposed to be 1981.

At one point we saw him driving past a palm tree; it's supposed to be upstate Washington.

Smack the person who tries to make you watch this movie.",1146268800,3,494,4.157894736842105
2445838,1,B000BYA5H8,"Let me warn you...this movie ain't pretty!  If this display is the directors vision, then we should blindfold and gag this fool and do society a favor.  The acting wasn't even 2nd rate...but perhaps 4th or 5th rate...I only lasted through perhaps 7 minutes.  My sensibilities were abused and assaulted...these hideous crimes were almost portrayed in a way that was meant to turn the audience on...for a minute I thought I was watching a poorly done porno flick.  What an insult to the victims of these crimes, whether they were prostitutes or not, it was not presented with any respect.  Don't waste your time on this one people...I could slap myself silly for wasting the rental money.  I could have bought a good cup of coffee and read a good book instead.",1141516800,9,758,4.704545454545454
8094056,1,B000BYA5H8,No stars! !! The worst movie I've ever seen. I regret purchasing this movie. If I wanted porno I would have looked for porno. Sad was really looking forward seeing this movie.,1517788800,,175,4.5
8094057,1,B000BYA5H8,This movie is awful. It basically reminded me of some really messed up fetish porn. Would not recommend. If you want to watch a good movie on the green river killer watch hunt for the green river killer,1501891200,,202,4.342105263157895

8094060,1,B000BYA5H8,This movie is not suitable for the faint hearted. I ordered this in hopes of writing an essay for college and showing a clip of the movie to the class. This is not appropriate for a class setting. I saw that it was rated R but I think the reason that is printed on the back of the movie on why it is rated R should be in the description. This movie is violent and has very graphic and detailed in sexual scenes and not what I expected. It is pretty much a porno. I guess I should have read up on the movie before purchase. The only good thing about this is that there is a hassle free return.,1447372800,,592,3.941666666666667
