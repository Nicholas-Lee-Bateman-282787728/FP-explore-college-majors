8653314,5,B00JQJ4WD2,Outstanding film on a rural community in a village in Japan. I found the performances excellent and the story fascinating. The moral codes are in line with life in an unforgiving environment where there is little room for hypocrisy or fake emotions. I strongly recommend this.,1421193600,,276,5.021739130434782
