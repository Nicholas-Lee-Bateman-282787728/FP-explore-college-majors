8056973,5,B000937D4O,This is a must have for any serious filmmaker. Lloyd Kaufman is the genius behind Troma and one of the coolest people on the planet. This 5 DVD set basically sucks the 30+ years of independent filmmaking knowledge out of Mr. Kaufman's brain and spills it on the table for everyone to learn from. everything from Scriptwriting to production to Marketing and distribution. Buy a copy today and while your at it buy a copy of The Toxic Avenger novel. Good bedtime reading for all the kiddies.,1161907200,,489,4.632183908045977
8056974,5,B000937D4O,"this dvd box set is educational, inspirational, and entertaining. there are a bunch of documenteries that were entertaining and  there are very informative interviews with veterans of film making. lloyd kaufman doesnt beat around the bush. i feel i got alot of major dos and donts on making a film.
i am a musician with a real DIY aproach to releasing c.d.'s and touring, and while this box set is for making your own damn movie it can also be used as inspiration for any art one is involved in. so i would say buy this box set and go out and make your own damn art!!!",1151366400,,568,4.308411214953271
8056975,5,B000937D4O,"When I was in a movie theatre, I watched the movie break down infront of me and I felt dissapointed. Dissapointed at what I saw up infront of me. The same cookie cutter plots and crappy themes with the same bland actors. Well Lloyd Kaufman says Make Your Own Damn Movie, and he'll show you how! Using this DVD set, he interviews many famous indepentent filmmakers and pop culture icons on how they made their own damn movie. Definatelty worth the price, and appeals to all filmmakers and Troma fans a like!",1144022400,,506,4.510869565217392
8056976,5,B000937D4O,I loved this DVD and I have been offering it to all my friends at filmschool. Original and funny!,1143504000,,97,4.157894736842105
8056977,5,B000937D4O,"When I told my holier-than-thou films school snot buddies that Lloyd Kaufman is the quintessential pop artist (not unlike Andy Warhol) they all scoffed at me...well now I scoff at them! While they are all still toiling away in post film school hell, working on detergent commercials...I just got a distribution deal for my sweet new blood and boobies DV feature.  Now, while all those dudes are paying off 500K loans, I own this informative little ditty free and clear!  Thanks Lloyd Kaufman, your set hooked me UP!",1143504000,,515,4.840909090909091
8056978,5,B000937D4O,"No, just kidding, but I did find this set informative and entertaining.  You can learn a lot about filmmaking from the errors of others, and Make Your Own Damn Movie shows that in spades.  And with over 20 hours of content, it's a steal at $50.  If you're an aspiring filmmaker or even just a fan of Troma, the Make Your Own Damn Movie Box Set is for you.",1143504000,4,355,4.115942028985507
8056979,5,B000937D4O,"This is a great, comprehensive set of DVDs for both experienced and aspiring filmmakers.  It's informative, hilarious, and above all, practical.  Kaufman's low budget filmmaking lessons are more relevant to people who want to make their own films than anything you'd learn at film school-- and a hell of a lot cheaper, too.  And to top it off, the interviews and behind-the-scenes footage are really, really funny.",1143504000,2,414,5.149253731343284
8056980,2,B000937D4O,"Let me just say that for some people this DVD will be great to see an independent working on his films. But you can see that kind of stuff on special features of better movies. Robert Rodriguez has a 10-minute filmschool on each of his DVD's and they give more information.

The thing I didn't like about this DVD is that it says it's filmschool in a box, but it seems more like a promotion for the filmmakers movies and his company. He had on one part on how to raise money and the only thing he said was there is no one way to raise money and then he showed a session of his actors performing for some investors, but it was not helpful. He still didn't tell you how to get the investors to get a performance.

For $50 and something that promised filmschool in a box it didn't deliver. Get the book instead. I think the concept of a DVD like this is great but it didn't deliver.

Buy it to check it out if you want to and make up your own mind about it. But I don't recommend this.",1121126400,20,982,4.051546391752577
