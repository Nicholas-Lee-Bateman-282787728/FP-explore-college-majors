8236474,1,B000083G61,"please make it standard to supply customers with:
1. langauge/audio formats (5.1, ac3, dts etc.)
2. title tracks/hit list in the full.
3. aspect ratio (screen size projection)

you may have many reviews from customers (mainly subjective)  - but without the above said data one is lost in gathering what quality you are purchasing.

thank you.
