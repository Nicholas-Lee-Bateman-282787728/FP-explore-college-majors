The guy basically used a tripod and started shooting himself working out on different days, like for example db curls, bench presses, squats just the regular stuff.. plus a minute or so with a tree or something on his back just like what you saw on the ""trailer"" on youtube .. oh and a minute or so sticking a nail in his arm and taking it out... like a cheap S&M porn ...LOL!

In short, Youtube clips and instead of uploading them there, he put them on a dvd!

So in order to make this a two hours long DVD here's what they did:
1- Working out footage without music basically him growling and such.
2- Same footage with music.
3- Same footage with him commenting, which am absolutely sure it won't add a single thing your knowledge.
4- The couple of minutes nail scene, which I talked about above.
5- His supplements, which is only MuscleTech crap! btw, if u didn't know, he is sponsored by MuscleTech! What a coincidence!!

Does this add anything to your knowledge in powerlifting?
No!!

If you want to learn about powerlifting routines or anything related to powerlifting... try Elitefts.com... westside barbell Louie Simmons DVDs and ebook... Hell even if you go to youtube and search for powerlifters there you will actually learn something rather than this crappy DVD!

As for the autograph..... who cares!!

SAVE YOUR MONEY!!

I hope this helps .....",1328572800,4,1474,4.599236641221374
8228642,5,B000XJNSFM,"Okay...

Matt Hughes autobiography is laughable and the first disc bio is a bit better but not super essential. The production isn't amateur like the BJ Penn bio but its not fabulous...it is a bit self serving although not as gag inducing as his book. The second disc however is truly worthy if you are looking to be schooled in a variety of MMA technique because you want to play around with it yourself...or if you are a fan of the sport and want a couple hour primer on all the elements that go into a fighters arsenal from stances to submissions and all points in between.  These are both 16x9 widescreen and professionally filmed dvds.  I don't regret this purchase and in comparison to many others I feel good keeping this at 5 star value at under 20 bucks.",1296518400,,763,4.435714285714286
