8014566,5,B0001ME59Y,"Within the secretive world of Venetian glassmaking, Dale Chihuly sees an opportunity to create exquisite work-if only he can get the two greatest glass masters to work together! Watch as Chihuly works first individually, and then together, with Lino Tagliapietra and Pino Signoretto for a series of historic glassblowing sessions.

Chihuly Working with Lino Tagliapietra brings you into the hotshop to witness master glassblower Tagliapietra interpret Chihuly's drawings into glass, which in turn inspires Chihuly to create more drawings to continue the collaborative cycle.

Chihuly Working with Pino Signoretto finds Signoretto, known for his master's ability to sculpt his visions of undersea life and the cherubic Putti figures, in the hotshop creating forms of amazing artistry, scale, and finesse.

The Masters of Venice explores the unusual and previously unthinkable gamble that Chihuly took in bringing the two Italian glass masters together, two men who would never consider working together in the secretive climate of Venice. In the end, the effort pays off in some of the most imaginative and techinally challenging glass ever created.
