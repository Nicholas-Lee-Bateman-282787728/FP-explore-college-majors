8612107,1,B00F3OLUEI,"Terrible DVD s, the narrator can't pronounce any French, Dutch, German names, every city so far has been filmed on dreary ,rainy winterdays...completely missing the vibrant beauty of the cities. This is a low budget, boring sepia toned dvd series. No interviews with locals, no inside building filming, just useless !",1459555200,,317,5.235294117647059
8612108,4,B00F3OLUEI,"I am very please with these video. They are very informative, the picture quality is great.  Job well done.",1435276800,,107,4.631578947368421
8612109,1,B00F3OLUEI,"The worst travel narrative ever created.  The droning and overly wordy narrator manages to make cities such as Tokyo, Prague, Budapest, Helsinki and London boring beyond belief.  This makes an Oxford history lecture look far more exciting.

Of the one's that we watched, only the one about Berlin was tolerable.  Perhaps that is because the English narrator was driven to make the point that the city is no longer dominated by Nazis, Communists, or the Berlin Wall!

Much of the footage is exterior shots of buildings and distance shots of the local people.  There is no mixing with any of the local populace, interviews or even tourist opinions.  The Tokyo segment was overly dominated by night views showing the neon display billboards, seconded only by an extended segment on the corporate architecture of the business district.  The street level shots are often lingering, leaving the viewer to shout ""Move on, please go to the next item"".

Despite the cover's promises of delving into customs and cuisine, there is so little of either that it makes you wonder if the author of the CD jacket even watched the contents of the series.  Most of the restaurant coverage is of outside shops, sometimes with people shown eating on the inside.

If you contrast this to Ian Wright's ""Lonely Planet/ Globetrekker"" series, you will instantly realize you have wasted your money.

Look elsewhere for your travel advice, especially if you are paying for it.",1434240000,2,1448,4.962655601659751
8612110,5,B00F3OLUEI,"These are so awesome.  I had seen these, and checked them out at our local library.  I enjoyed them so much, I wanted them for me to watch anytime I want.  Very interesting facts in each location.  I can never afford to go to all of these places, but a part of me feels I have already been to each city.",1394409600,4,303,3.918032786885246
8612111,5,B00F3OLUEI,"Wonderful DVD, short history lesson of each city, and then a  tour of the city. Arial photography is incredible. A good purchase.",1389052800,4,129,4.863636363636363
