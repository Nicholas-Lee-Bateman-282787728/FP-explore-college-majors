1193431,5,B000006GDT,"I saw this as a kid when it was first in theaters.  It was disappointing back then (as far as living up to the ads), but it has always maintained a special place in my heart as one of the great bad movies.  It even has a good cast; Ernest Borgnine, Walter Pidgeon to name a few.
A venture is building an underwater research facility with an eye towards undersea colonization.  At the heart is a habitat called Oceanlab II.  They were hoping to discover something about how earthquakes are caused when they experience one and fall into the depths (about 1,000 feet).  If all is well, they only have a limited number of days of life support.
After a sub can find no traces, a special sub, the Neptune, is brought in.  This is a funny sub.  It is all bright white and orange and very limited batteries.  It looks like a toy.  I guess that helps when a toy is maneuvered through a fish tank as part of the special effects.
As one can see from the box, the crew encounter big fish.  Really big fish.
What's so bad?  Well, how about a highly specialized sub where the Captain doesn't use a proper crew?  He uses some of the divers from the venture and they seem to know all about operating the sub.
How about a deep-sea sub that runs out of power and gives up before they go as deep as the conventional sub?
How about a Captain who keeps trying to call off the rescue mission (until the very end when he gives in)?
How about Ernest Borgnine constantly leaving the sub to check things out instead of using the sub?
How about laughable sound effects meant to be the sounds of big fish?
How about aerial shots of a calm ocean with clear skies that always turns to heavy haze when seen from shipdeck?
How about the crew of a science ship using their eyes to see if the sub is returning instead of using the sonar?
All this adds up to a wonderfully bad movie that fits in with the idea that many film greats end their careers in mediocre movies.  Such is the case with Pidgeon (this was not quite his last film), another example is Orson Wells who ended with Transformers: The Movie (he played a big fat planet).
So bad you just have to watch this one.",1059350400,4,2141,4.24384236453202
1193432,1,B000006GDT,I remember this as being the worst movie I had ever seen in my whole life.  It has the honor of being the first movie I ever fell asleep in.  Fortunately I woke up before the climax when the submarine encounters gigantic tropical aquarium fish.  Oooh pretty.  Probably me and the other reviewer are the only people who have seen this.  It has been too many years to know if this is still the worst movie I have ever seen but when I finally die it will be in the top five.  No hard feelings Neptune Factor.  I have loved to hate you for years.,995587200,11,542,4.104761904761904
1193433,5,B000006GDT,"This is one of those movies that has MSTK written all over it. There is some tension generated, but the sheer rediculousness of the production really gets in the movie's way.
The story starts out with an underwater  sea lab getting caught in a seaquake, and it disappears down a deep ocean  trench. The surface crew desperately tries to rescue the men trapped below,  calling in divers and even a submarine, all to no avail. Then, with time  running out, an experimental small super-sub is pressed into service. So  far, so good. But as the crew of the super-sub begin their search, things  begin to get laughable. The sub finds itself surrounded by gigantic  tropical fish and other sea life! What the producers did was simply place  their models in a large aquarium and expect us to believe the crew was  really in danger of becoming guppy-food. True, Ernest Borgnine is good in  his  typical portrayal of the  ""the-hell-with-the-safety-protocols!"" character. And the overall  idea of the movie is pretty interesting. But that alone cannot save this  sinker... er, stinker!
Worst of all is the total waste of Walter Pigeon's  character. In one of his last roles, Walter is reduced to merely looking  concerned about events.
This movie is really only good for those of us  who enjoy bad sci-fi, and get a good laugh out of it.
For a GOOD  underwater picture along the same lines, I'd recommend ""The  Abyss"". And for Walter Pigeon underwater and in sci-fi command, the  original ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" is your best bet.",923616000,22,1530,4.767175572519084
1193464,4,B000006GDT,"I am pretty sure the genesis of this movie was a screenwriter stuck staring at a salt-water aquarium in some waiting room and thought ""I can make a movie about this..."". Most of the underwater footage was obviously shot in an aquarium, and the plot that gets us there is razor thin. I have to admire the fact that the movie feels no obligation to explain much of anything - you just have to take everything at face value. Still, I enjoy this movie despite its sheer silliness. The current DVD copy available is a pretty good transfer, so I am looking forward to the HD quality to see how that looks in comparison.",1477785600,,613,4.385964912280702

1193471,3,B000006GDT,"Long time ago, when I was a kid, I saw this film in cinema and I ADORED it - well, I was nine years old... I bought and re-watched it as part of a recent nostalgia trip to revisit some of the films from my childhood, and well, of course, it aged and also I realised that from the beginning it was not so great as I thought then...)))  But still, I don't regret that I bougt it - and I am so keeping it!

PRECISION: this is a Region 1 NTSC DVD - it will NOT play on region 2 European equipement. Also, this film was also distributed under alternative titles ""Neptune's adventure"" and ""An underwater odyssey"".

In the beginning of the film we are introduced to a small fixed underwater laboratory called ""Sealab"" (it was a tribute to the ""Skylab""), on board of which scientists experiment with various small sea lifeforms to study oceanic food chain. They also study the effects an extended stay in such a confined space have on human body and mind. In theory ""Sealab"" could accomodate as much as twelve people for an extended stay, but the regular crew is six: three oceanologists, one doctor and two technicians.

The current campaign of experiments is now concluded and the six men crew will be replaced by new arrivals. Three men leave ""Sealab"" for the mother ship anchored nearby - and just then an earthquake breaks the underwater cliff on which ""Sealab"" was posed and the underwater lab goes down, in an abyss, together with tens of thousands tons of rocks... This film is about a difficult research to locate ""Sealab"" and the three men still on board, before they run out of air - a research complicated by the fact that alost everybody is convinced, that the lab was crushed and those men died.

Now, once again, this is a Sci-Fi B-movie from 70s and obviously it has all the flaws of this kind of films, like some silly dialogs,  extremely obvious plot holes, some scenes which are too long and also one extremely boring character played by Walter Pidgeon, who was wasted in this film. But I still rather enjoyed watching it, as it has also some honest qualities:

- the claustrophobic atmosphere on board of small submersible ""Neptune"" which conducts the search

- the cast, which includes Ben Gazzara who plays Commander Blake, the pilot of the submersible, gorgeous Yvette Mimieux, who plays a scientist whose husband is on board of ""Sealab"" and great Hollywood veteran and workoholic extraordinaire Ernest Borgnine

- many great underwater images

- a rather clever way to introduce ""sea monsters"" (well, they are not real monsters) in the plot

All this being said, to be absolutely honest, the reason why I liked this film more than it deserves is mostly because of some happy chiildhood memories. Otherwise, I would probably not rate it as an ""OK"" (three stars) thing. Therefore, this is probably NOT a film that you need to buy - you can actually also find it FOR FREE on internet.

But still, I am happy with my copy and for me, for my own personal reasons, this is a keeper.",1397174400,5,2992,4.582397003745318
1193472,4,B000006GDT,"This one was remembered too fondly and disappointment hit me when revisited. Cheesy 50s B-movies have a certain charm that this one doesnt have. First off its in color. It also takes itself way too serious. This only makes the ""special effects"" easier to laugh at. The Neptune is a bathtub toy when filmed from a distance. The fish are near pet store regulars. One fish has little teeth which sends the rescue crew into panic mode.
 The cast was generally good. Ernest is the best and most comfortable. You can tell when he supposedly is out diving that its a stunt double with a much trimmer waistline. Ben affects a lousy quasi-southern accent. I guess it was felt he needed something to do besides smirk, be negative and stare at Yvette. Walter is an expert at something, but I don't know what. He is given little to do except worry. Still a great actor and no harm done. The rest fill out the movie ok. Rated this one higher than it should be for sentimental value.",1245974400,,969,4.47457627118644
1193473,5,B000006GDT,"I have to give this DVD release of Neptune Factor a solid 5 stars just for the fact FOX released a decent sort of Special Edition of the film. Like the Cinema Classics Collection releases Fantastic Voyage and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea the Neptune Factor comes in a really nice slip cover case with cooler than the film artwork.

The DVD contains two isolated film score tracks one with the Lalo Schifin score w/ sound effects audio and a second isolated score track featuring an unused score by William McCauley. it also contains a theatrical teaser and trailer and two tv spots and a old featurette on the making of the film.

It doesn't contain a cool commentary track by the gang who did Fantastic Voyage that included Jeff Bond, Jon Burlingame or Nick Redman, but it is cool they did do isolated score tracks for the film.

I got it today and enjoyed it Very Much! If you enjoy underwater adventure, then you will enjoy this movie (widescreen).

1193501,2,B000006GDT,"MAN was this a bad movie!
For some strange reason, I remember LOVING this movie whenever it aired on local TV. I remember always being excited when it showed up on either the big networks or the small local stations...it was almost like an event for me! I could have sworn this was awesome...

And the poster is super. Terrific illustration art, colorful, dynamic.

NONE of what you see in the poster is in the movie, by the way.

I'm not certain exactly what sugar-fried confection my brain was on, but seriously, this is stupendously awful from script to screen.
The plot involves an undersea lab, an earthquake, a rescue op and giant fish.
The OceanLab could have been made from Legos, and the movie was entirely filmed in an aquarium in some dentist's office in Canada.
No, that's not correct. The movie would have been infinitely BETTER if it had used Legos and that dentist's aquarium...
Nearly every line recited by an actor is a small, completely intact cliche. If you never saw this movie, you could still finish each actor's line before he or she finished it on screen.
That could be a fun drinking game at a college somewhere.

Borgnine tries his best; Gazzara tries even harder. Mimieux doesn't have to try...she's the eye candy of the all-male cast. Walter Pidgeon looks befuddled. If you turn on the English subtitles, half of his lines are, and I quote, ""(exhales)"". That's it. A rush of air.

Now, this DVD is pretty swell, though. A contemporaneous short featurette, trailers, TV spots, promotional materials,  posters...and the image is remarkably crisp and colorful for a film of its' age and ""importance.""

The scenes with the fish looks SO bad...it's a riot. The triggerfish ramming the sub? Come on...a triggerfish? Couldn't they have come up with another more scary fish, like, I dunno, a perch? Salmon?

No, it's because all Dr. Simon DDS had in his office that day was triggerfish!

Seriously...it's SO bad but I'm still laughing at myself for once liking this. My folks must have thought I was mental...",1201824000,6,2029,4.774285714285714
1193502,1,B000006GDT,"I was completely unimpressed with THE NEPTUNE FACTOR when I, then all of twelve years old, saw the movie in its original 1973 theatrical release.  When I discovered the film available on DVD, I decided to revisit it on the chance that it had simply been over my then-youthful head--and upon seeing it again realized that I was a pretty good judge of films even way back then.  Simply put, THE NEPTUNE FACTOR bites a big one.

The plot was hackneyed even in 1973: an earthquake shakes up an undersea lab and a ""special submarine"" is dispatched to find out what has happened down there.  They go down, down, down to the bottom of the sea, they look out the submarine window, and they see... some really big fish.  Yep, that's about all there is to it.  They look at some really big fish.

Now, the cast itself isn't bad at all.  After all, it includes Walter Pigdeon, Ben Gazzara, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimieux--and they are very capable players.  And they give it their all, but they just can't get a lot of mileage out of it, particularly when the really big fish are just really big (and pretty grainy) close ups of little fish that you might find in somebody's home acquarium.  And then there's the submarine itself, which is clearly a plastic model, and which seems to have filmed at the bottom of a kiddie wading pool with some plastic seaweed stuff thrown in.

If this sounds boring, well, it is.  Now and then a really bad film can become accidentally entertaining.  It may be so bad that it's astonishing, as in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  It may be so bad that it's endearing, like ATTACK OF THE 50 WOMAN.  But most bad films are just dull and boring, and when it comes to dull and boring THE NEPTUNE FACTOR is working hard to lead the pack.  Give it a miss.

1193503,1,B000006GDT,"I don't know why this El Cheapo film is as well known as it is, except that there is no other underwater film  I can think of after ""Thunderball"" and before ""The Deep"". The sea monsters are basically magnified closeups of aquarium fish (yes, really) and the little plastic model of the submarine moving past the aquarium fish looks really bad.  (Did they get that model out of a cereal box?)  Ben ""Run For Your Life"" Gazarra is obnoxious and miscast. After achieving greatness in ""The Wild Bunch"" Ernest Borgnine is doing stuff like this and would soon be in another low budget film, ""The Devil's Rain"".

1193507,4,B000006GDT,"This Canadian-made film had a huge ad campaign back in the day(1973) with a poster sporting more than was delivered. A seaquake sends a rather cheap-looking model ""Oceanlab II"" into an unknown abyss and only the high-tech ""Neptune"", piloted by Ben Gazzara can rescue(begrudgingly) any survivors.  All-star cast, but sub(no pun!)par FX work that appears to have been shot in a large aquarium! The giant sea monsters are...gasp... sea bass, eels, sand sharks all filmed  close-up and ""giant"" in very sandy bottomed aquariums with a toy-model of the Neptune occasionally buffeted about and attacked by them. One shot has some animatronic(for the time) sea monsters but they look incredibly badly done. At once point the sub gets caught in a ""river of sand"". Some bad continuity topside does not help the film(sunny from outside the ship, cloudy from inside). However, good performances salvage some of this and it's good for laughs and, 70's nostalgia.

7904236,2,B000006GDT,"BOTTOM LINE: Basically, THE NEPTUNE FACTOR is an aquatic action adventure film - with no action and very little adventure. The F/X in this film make one long for any Japanese monster flick, or even an episode or two of Sid & Marty Krofft's Sigmund & The Sea Monsters show. If you lower your expectations about 20,000 leagues you *might* find this waterlogged outing mildly entertaining. Otherwise, you'll be treading water for 98 nauseating minutes. Recommended only for hardcore sci-fiers & certified B-movie masochists. 2 soggy STARS.

THOUGHTS: A solid cast of competent stars overreact to not-so-special effects shots which must have set the production budget back a whopping $5. Unscrupulous producers hired poor Walter Pidgeon for the film in a pathetically transparent attempt to associate this flaccid snoozefest with the classic (and far more entertaining) VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. After screening this turkey, Pidgeon probably wished he'd given this film The Bird and flown the coop. This movie would've been much better had it been done as a straightforward dramatic naval adventure film, in the same vein as GRAY LADY DOWN. Alas, the producers opted for a more fantasy-based adventure, but since they were unable (or unwilling) to spring for the extra cash required to realize such fantastical imagery then why didn't they simply farm out the visual work to the creative Japanese effects crews at Toho or Toei studios? At least then the film would have been enjoyable as pure surreal absurdist entertainment. Watching guys in outlandish fishmonster costumes, breathing fire, shooting laser beams and body slamming one another... something... ANYthing would have been better than what we got. The F/X on display in THE NEPTUNE FACTOR will immediately transport you back to childhood days of diving those dinky little cereal box, baking soda-powered plastic submarines around in your bathtub. In all honesty, that's about how exciting the visuals in this celluloid depthcharge are.

I took a chance and blind bought this film based solely on the plot description, cast and the imaginative theatrical poster art. After all, it was made in 1973, has a respectable cast and promised a ""fantastic undersea odyssey"" so it should be lotsa fun. Yeah, right. The grade school optical gimmickry used MIGHT have passed in a lower-tier 50's B-film, but in a mainstream motion picture from the mid-70's they're a reprehensible, embarrassing disgrace. Heck, THE NEPTUNE FACTOR isn't really even all that enjoyable on a ""so-bad-it's-good"" level.

Seriously, if you insist on submitting to this cinema enema, save yourself some cash and try to catch it online for free.

THE BLU-RAY: On the positive side, this hi-definition release for THE NEPTUNE FACTOR from Kino Lorber is a pretty good one. Strong picture & sound reproduction on the transfer. Film looks clean for the most part and has a clear, level soundmix. A respectable selection of bonus features ups the ante for collectors & fans of the film.

7904238,3,B000006GDT,"An ambitious Canadian ""tax-shelter"" production from 1973, The Neptune Factor keeps its underwater adventure story relatively classy with a cast that includes the always convincing Ernest Borgnine, the ethereally beautiful Yvette Mimieux and a hunky young Ben Gazzara.  Set aboard an experimental submarine on a rescue mission to save the survivors aboard a deep-sea habitat in distress, the crew descends to unexplored depths only to find....a salt-water aquarium?

Divers ""Mack"" MacKay (Borgnine) and Adrian Blake (Gazzara) are headed topside when a quake sends their advanced underwater lab - and three crew members - tumbling into a bottomless abyss.  Desperate for help, their prayers are answered when the Neptune arrives on a test run and its skipper agrees to scout for the wreck before life support runs out.  But a deep-water current pulls them into a cavern filled with monstrous fish, pushing the sub to the limit and threatening their very survival.

No matter how scientifically accurate director Daniel Petrie (Fort Apache The Bronx) sets things up, the film's third act is an embarrassing mix of miniatures and live-action fish that hearkens back to the days of Irwin Allen-style Lost World lizards passing themselves off as dinosaurs.  The actors stare out of green-screen portholes into close-up shots of eels, crabs and one particularly pushy triggerfish while their toy submarine floats past on amusement park rails.  Even kids will have a hard time suspending their disbelief, which probably explains why The Neptune Factor has sunk out of the public eye.

But Kino Lorber's new special edition Blu-ray makes a case for reappraisal...or at least a little leniency.  The new high-definition transfer is gorgeous, pushing the colors and details to unexpected levels of brilliance.  And with the film looking so good, one starts to realize just how much there is to like besides the fishy finale.  The audio commentary by the Canuxploitation.com team points out Petrie and producer Sanford Howard's goals of technical realism, designing the sub and underwater lab to actual scientific specs.  And the cast sells every plot point, no matter how ridiculous.  Backing them up is a bombastically catchy Lalo Schifrin score (included on an isolated track) that gives the entire production a deceptively huge sense of scale.

Additional extras include a never before released alternate score by William McCauley, archival Making Of featurette (with plenty of behind-the-scenes footage, an animated still montage, trailer, teaser and TV spots.",1480377600,,2553,5.381909547738694
