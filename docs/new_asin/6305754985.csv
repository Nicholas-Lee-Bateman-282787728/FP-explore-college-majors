7894706,5,6305754985,"""Shore Leave"" and ""The Squire of Gothos"" are two of my favorite episodes.  In ""Shore Leave"" the crew decide to take a pit stop on a planet they discover.  After they transport to the surface of  the planet weird things begin to happen.  Like some crew members are shot  at by a plane resembling one from 20th century Earth.  Where are all the  people and who is running the planet? I like ""Shore Leave""  because you learn a little bit of background on several of the main  characters and you get to see Kirk fight, which I think is hilarious.  I  like ""The Squire of Gothos"" because it has a weird medieval feel  to it and is a little campy.  Some of the crew have to deal with the mind  games of the Squire.  If you enjoy the ""Squire of Gothos,"" you  learn a bit more about him in a Star Trek book about the Q continuum titled  Q-Squared by Peter David.  It's a very good book in itself. I reccomend  seeing both these episodes.",959644800,6,929,4.2057142857142855
7894707,5,6305754985,"With each successive DVD release, I rediscover just why I LOVE classic Trek so much.  The thing about classic Star Trek is that it's got so much going for it that when it's good, it's really good.  And that's the case  with the two episodes featured on this DVD.
The first episode in this  volume is by sci-fi master Theodore Sturgeon (who also gave us the second  season ""Amok Time""), ""Shore Leave.""  The crew beams  down for what appears to be a simple vacation, but this being Trek, things  aren't always what they seem.  It appears the crews dreams and fantasies  are coming to life--often with deadly and dangerous results.  It's  certainly an interesting look at the characters and showcases the actors  and actresses talent.  And it's also one of those fun episodes to watch in  great detail on repeat viewing to notice the flubs such as the sequence  with the tiger and the fact that Kirk runs past the same set of trees  several times in a chase sequence.  Add to it that it features a lot of  memorable musical cues by Alexander Courage and you've got a very enjoyable  episode of Trek.
Following it is ""The Squire of Gothos"" which  was intriguing for 20-some odd years before Q came along to give even more  meaning to the stories.  (If you haven't read Peter David's superlative  Q-Squared, what are you waiting for? ).  Kirk is once again called upon to  defeat a god-like being and the journey there is entertaining and great to  watch.  The episode is still filled with tension and drama after all these  years and seeing it more times than I can count.
These episodes show  off all the strengths that classic Trek has to offer and a perfect addition  to any collection.",956620800,10,1685,4.572390572390573
7894708,4,6305754985,"So far the only things I have found lacking in these DVD's is the lack of extras to include Spanish/French subtitles and dubbing as well a extra info about the shooting of the individual episodes such as unseen footage,  etc...",955411200,2,227,4.675
7894709,3,6305754985,"Both of the Episodes on this DVD (Vol. 9) display the lighter side of the original series' cast members.  In ""Shore Leave"" you see definite character expansion  for the doctor, the navigator and the captain.  Dr.  McCoy shows more of his ""country doctor"" persona as he strolls  along a lakeside path, Sulu displays his special interest in weaponry,  taking the time to shoot of several rounds, while Captain Kirk reveals his  long held desires to ""get even"" with a past star fleet academy  classmate.  You indeed see Kirk become a wild adolescent on this planet,  when level headed Spock raises a concern about a pending crisis and Kirk  shouts, ""Go warn the others, I've got a score to settle!"" and  then bolts off to do some long overdue backside kicking!  I think you'll  enjoy watching both of these episodes again when your focus is on what  these characters do to handle themselves in  curious situations.",954288000,2,911,4.780645161290322
