3952320,4,B002MLEG78,"I saw it when it came on cartoonetwork at first before it came on I thought it was going to be like the first one. But I was wrong it was way better than the first one if you ever watch the TV show and liked it then your enjoy this movie. Every thing about the show was just like in the movie Kevin was cool and funny ,Gwen powers was the same wich was cool but Ben did the best job in the movie and his aliens where way better then the first movie. I think they should make another one I just have one more thing to say just give it a chance don't judge a book buy its cover but the cover is cool to thanks.",1259107200,14,608,3.7209302325581395

3952350,1,B002MLEG78,Nowhere did I see anything that stated this movie was in Italian and sent from Italy.  It took FOREVER to receive and my son was greatly disappointed when it wouldn't play in his DVD player due to the wrong region.  I contacted the seller and he didn't seem all that concerned but did give me an address to return it.  I didn't bother but I will not buy from this seller again!,1319846400,,377,4.208333333333333

3952352,1,B002MLEG78,"It is so for kids... I did not see aliens, not even single one, instead there was someone (might be alien) who must naive stand still like a zombie and wait till somebody from ""heroes"" would kick him so many times until poor zombie hit the ground. Movie has a lot of CGI but characters look like overact too much. In too words that unrealistic imagination does not take your breath away.
As for quality it looks like blu ray was produced by someone rookie. HD picture was mixed with overexposed low resolution quality every 20-30 seconds of movie. If you'll pay attention at every shade spot you can see ""send storm"" of white pixels running through it flickering like under candle light. It's like an old film movie where you could see low quality because of micro-scratches on 35mm film.
I had couple blu rays like this and had to return it. It is shame on those who produce that kind crap quality letting down to all others hard work (actors, producers and so on).
If you are something like under 15 you may will like this movie.",1285286400,,1031,4.4603174603174605
3952353,5,B002MLEG78,"Now I have to admit I'm already sixteen and that movies like this should make me sick but in all truth, I loved this movie! It was absolutely fantastic. The cast was well thought out and played their parts almost exactly like the animated characters. There were plenty of action scenes and the occasional cheesy scenes, but all ""live action"" movies have those. The plot was pretty good considering it's just a spin-off of a childrens show but.... The music was great too. The only real complaint I have about this movie is the slightly cheesy effects. Some of them were actually pretty cool like Ben's transformations and stuff but some were just plain bad. It is DEFINITELY worth the price you're going to pay.",1280361600,4,711,4.696
3952354,4,B002MLEG78,"Let me begin by saying that if you are reading this review after Ben 10 Ultimate Alien comes out, there might be some mistaken info in here, as this was written a week before it's premiere.

With that out of the way, I'll say that Ben 10 Alien Swarm sounds like it could be a great movie, but it had some problems. The casting was great (though Grandpa Max was debatable), the plot was phenomenal, and the special effects were amazing. Now for the bad points. Uh, on second thought, I'll just list this as pros and cons.

Pros
 Great Casting (again, give or take Max).
 Great Plot.
 Great Special Effects.
 a VERY COOL new alien (don't worry, I won't spoil his name for those who haven't seen this)

 Sorry, but that's it for pros.

Cons
 VERY few fight scenes.
 Gwen didn't act quite like she did in the show. (She had a lot more spunk)
 The team had an UNDERGROUND BASE o_0 (seriously, who came up with that)
 Gwen didn't use her force fields in the movie (make of that what you will)
 There weren't many of Ben's aliens, unless you count those little holograms that appeared over the Omnitrix from time to time

and the NUMBER ONE THING THAT BOTHERED ME

the continuity issue...

...I know for a fact that the new alien and Ben's new (how shall I say) ""vehicle"" are NOT going to appear until Ben 10 Ultimate Alien (which looks great by the way). Okay, so maybe the movie takes place during Ultimate Alien (which might explain the UNDERGROUND BASE o_0 but I doubt it) But that still leaves out the fact that he called his watch the Omnitrix instead of the ******trix (I'm NOT going to spoil THAT for you) after the Alien Force season finale. Not to mention the fact that Ben wasn't well known as a hero like he supposedly is in Ultimate Alien.

In conclusion this is an okay film (DEFINITELY better than Race Against Time) and a nice purchase for a young Ben Tennyson fan or two, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a Ben 10 dvd, especially if you're an older fan, like I am. All in all, I would buy all the volumes of the tv series that this movie is based on before buying this movie.",1271376000,,2091,4.304347826086956
3952355,5,B002MLEG78,"VERY GOOD FILM. ALOT OF ACTION, AND GOOD ACTING BY ALL. I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I LIKED BEN 10 RACE AGAINST TIME ALOT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL VIEWERS. AWANAKARD",1270944000,,177,4.393939393939394

3952357,5,B002MLEG78,My son wanted this for Christmas and I couldn't find it in stores. It arrived very quickly.,1265414400,,91,4.411764705882353
3952358,5,B002MLEG78,"My seven year old son loves the cartoon version.  This movie was actually pretty well done and he watched it several times in one weekend. Some of the acting lacked somewhat and I did not like the casting for ""grandpa"".  With a bigger budget it could have rivaled movies like Spiderman and Transformers. In all it turned out pretty good for being based on a cartoon. Any Ben 10 fan will most likely like this movie.",1264291200,3,415,4.447368421052632
3952359,4,B002MLEG78,"It's an all-new movie based on the cool series ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" called ""Ben 10 Alien Swarm"".

In this movie Ben (Ryan Kelley) meets an old friend of his that needs his help.  However, Gwen, Kevin, and even Grandpa Max don't trust her.  But Ben, along with his new and improved Omnitrix, will prevail once he saves humanity from imminent destruction from another planet.

This is a pretty cool movie next to ""Ben 10: Race Against Time"".  This DVD has a music video by There for Tomorrow and some behind-the-scenes features, too !

So get this movie if you like the Alien Force spin-off to Ben 10.  And look for more new episodes on Cartoon Network.",1261353600,9,651,4.512820512820513
3952360,5,B002MLEG78,"I saw a preview for this film on a Cinemark Theatre monitor in their lobby and was intrigued enough to buy it. I had never seen the cartoon on the Cartoon Network, but this movie was well worth the price and was very entertaining.

The actor who played Kevin Levin, Nathan Keyes, really stole the show, in my opinion. He is a very confident actor and seeing him behind the wheel of a sports car not only seemed believable but looked natural for him. Kevin's character is kind of like the high school jock, without the compulsion to be a bully, and with a sharp mind to go along with it. Ryan Kelley, who played Ben, was quite good as well, and certainly added to the movie. But Keyes was extremely well cast and for me portrayed the most memorable character, and was very likeable despite his bad boy persona. I suspect that Keyes has a successful acting career ahead of him.

All in all this was a cool little film. Although targeted toward the teen set, I'm above that age group and enjoyed it quite a bit. Should the Cartoon Network decide to make a sequel, I'll buy that too, so long as Kelley and especially Keyes are brought back.",1260576000,8,1136,4.37914691943128
