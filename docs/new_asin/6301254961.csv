Younger children may have trouble with the concepts of the movie and the undertones may not be approriate for small children.  Over all, very interesting plot remiscent of Star Wars and other movies that have a ""chosen one"" in it.",1124323200,4,354,4.709677419354839

322624,4,6301254961,"Starchaser is a space opera along the same lines as Star Wars. You have the evil villain in a cape, spaceships blowing up each other, lasers flashing with neat noises, robots cracking jokes, heroes saving the day. You have it all. What ties it all together is a rather simple story that has been executed well. While some may find Starchaser too derivative I see a lot of charm in it.

The movie's biggest claim to fame is how they rotoscoped cell animation over computer animation to make various elements of the movie have a very fluid effect. This is especially true for the spaceships, which are pretty awesome for a movie made in the mid-80's. The rotoscoping technique gives a level of freedom of movement in the spaceship scenes that really stand out from anything else in this era. It's really a treat to watch the Starchaser weave around gun turrets and blasting away the bad guys.

The rest of the animation is close to what you saw on movies like Rock and Rule and to a lesser extent Heavy Metal. Solid cel drawings with decent to good animation, but not Disney quality. The original film was in 3D, but there is no 3D here. Probably a good thing considering 3D DVD's aren't exactly popular. The movie more than makes up for the lack of 3D and non-Disney quality with a clever script and excellent voice cast. You'll find yourself loving one or more of the characters because of the voice talents and what they say.

Now it's been said that Starchaser is just a Star Wars rip-off, and if you look for it you will probably say that too. You have a young ""out of touch with the modern world"" hero with a sword that cuts through about anything, a wisecracking smuggler who is also captain of a starship (the Starchaser), a prissy comic foil in the ship's computer, and a villian with all the stereotypical profiles for a space opera villain (just like Darth Vader had). In all fairness Star Wars was a rip-off of the classic space operas from the old Saturday morning matinees so keep that in mind when passing judgement. Also most who make this judgement tend to not see the things that make this movie different from Star Wars, and there is enough to do so. It's not like comparing Fisful of Dollars with Yojimbo (which are practically identical movies). More like comparing Rocky with The Karate Kid (same themes, but different approach and story path).

Now that the DVD version is finally here you can get this movie in it's original widescreen format. The only copies you could have gotten in the past were full frame and were either on VHS tape or transferred from VHS tape. Now this DVD is a no frills deal. There is no remastering to clean up the picture so you will see a fair amount of dirt, which is to be expected for a long neglected title. The sound is actually pretty good and in true stereo, but it's not Dolby Digital. There are no special features that I have found. Not even a trailer. Oh well. At least we finally have it on DVD. And the price definitely makes it worth a look.

The movie is PG for violence and mild language (very mild by today's standards). I suppose the movie can be a tad too violent for the youngest of viewers, but if they can handle Star Wars there shouldn't be a problem. If you enjoy space opera this movie should suite you just fine. If you're into animated science fiction that's on the lighter side you should get a kick out this too. Personally I love it in spite of any shortcomings others might find.",1120694400,25,3461,4.469936708860759
322625,5,6301254961,"Just to let all know who already don't, Starchaser - The Legend Of Orin was originally released as a 3-D animated movie spectacular (poster read ""The Best 3-D Movie Ever Made!"") in movie theaters back in 1985.  It would be fantastic if it was 3-D on DVD, but from what is stated above, thankfully presented in the original widescreen format we all enjoy...this movie is TRULY an animated classic with definite rereleased ""Star Wars"" characters, though it has a completely different story and entertainment value - the animation is at times old-fashioned, but all spacecraft and building interiors are in incredibly illustrated 3-dimensional artwork enhanced with CG technology.  The motion is beautiful and exciting to watch and all the characters play such great parts in the film, and the whole picture changes from place to place every few minutes showing off completely different alien lands and creatures.  The beginning takes place somewhere the rest of the movie doesn't, which always makes a great thrill for a space adventure about to happen...it's got creepy alien creatures, plenty of excellent action, classic super villians and anything else you'd ever want in both a space fantasy and an animated motion picture.  Best replay value ever due to the extremely worn-out copy I personally have on old school VHS - a 5-star family adventure film for sure (even the rest of my own family loved it!) in 3-D or not!",1119484800,15,1421,5.008474576271187
322626,3,6301254961,It is a unique story with a few characters having a remarkable likness to several of the Star Wars characters.  I originally saw this movie in the Theaters (Oh so many years ago).  However if you look past the obvious above it is a very good movie.  I purchased the Video years ago and wore it out.  I have been waiting for this for over 10 years and pre-ordered it the day it was announced.  I hope this helps.,1117324800,5,411,4.151898734177215
322627,4,6301254961,"I almost had a chance to see Starchaser on the big screen, but it seemed to have disappeared from existence before I made it to the theater. Years later I happened to catch it at a video store and boy was I glad I did. This movie is great fun to watch. It seems to have a wonderful mix of a well developed background and characters with a rather simplistic plot that has been seen in different forms since the 50's Saturday matinees.

The characters are colorful and fun to watch. You get some great voice acting on this film. Dag, the scoundrel type, is a cool mix of James Dean and Han Solo and the ship's computer... well... imagine C-3PO in spaceship form. I know it sounds like this movie is a Star Wars knock off, and maybe in a few ways it is. But keep in mind Star Wars is a knock off of those Saturday matinees I mentioned previously so ultimately the content has been classic long before Lucas got his hands on it.

The animation is reminiscent to Heavy Metal or Rock and Rule, but seems more polished than the former in my opinion. It's not up to Disney standards, but it's a far cry from what most animation houses were making at that time. Another cool thing is they incorperated computer wireframe animation and rotoscoped it to give the spaceships more fluid movement. Tres' cool.

To be honest forget looking for this thing on VHS now that the DVD is out. The DVD version has nice clean audio and you get the see the film in widescreen format. Also it's priced to move. The really isn't any reason to purchase the VHS. I think Starchaser: The Legend of Orin is probably best suited for fans of science fiction animation, as the average viewer might not ""get it"". Then again maybe more people than I give credit for will really get into this movie. Either way I loved it and definitely recommend anybody to check it out.",1088899200,,1835,4.375366568914956

The animation is pretty good and considering this was before computer animation, it's rather impressive. The storyline borrows heavily from Star Wars, sometimes even using dialogue nearly identical the original Star Wars films. There are some elements to the story line that depart from Star Wars and make the film just unique enough to keep it interesting, (instead of Orin the protagonist being a farmer like Luke Skywalker, he's a slave in an underground mining colony for instance). The story hinges heavily on a mysterious ""sword"" which Orin finds will digging in the mine. While the film will probably always remain obscure, it may be worth the time of sci-fi fans to check it out if for no other reason than to compare it to Star Wars and kill an hour or two.",1369440000,,924,4.709876543209877

Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.
----------------------------------------

Ah... 'Starchaser: Legend of Orin', I myself stumbled across this on Youtube some years ago and watched the whole film.  It was posted by a fan, and was in like 8 pieces, but I painstakely watched it none-the-less.  By the way, this is a prime example of where watching a video on the internet in turn makes the viewer go out and buy it.  I have watched many movies/Animes on the internet and then had to own them.  Cracking down on the uploaded content we the citizens can access is a mistake and also will hurt media sales.  I mean how would I have even learned about this GREAT movie without the internet.  Without getting to watch it and learn I REALLY liked it, why would I have ever have bought it?  Just saying, anywho...

This movie is pure 1980's.  This was when Sci-Fi cartoons were abundant and people loved them very much.  Is this a 'Star Wars' rip off?  Absolutely.  But 'Star Wars' ripped off samourai movies and other things, so in the end let's just say that everything rips off everything and leave it at that.

**Movie Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**

The film begins by showing a large group of humans living in slavery on the planet Trinia.  Robots similar in appearance to the Cylons from 'Battlestar Galactia' whip them constantly.  The humans mine a red crystal and the crystals are then ""fed"" to their god they worship, Zygon.  With me so far?

Well, it soon appears obvious that the poor humans have been lied to and that they are in fact living under false assumptions and beliefs.  The rules they follow, ""dig down, never up"", is obviously in place to prevent them from ever discovering that there is another world above them and that they should not be slaves.

Enter Orin, a young man who doesn't want to blindly follow the rules anymore and can not take another day living as a slave.  Orin is kind hearted, in fact he digs for the old people and just about kills himself trying to keep the task-masters off the older folk's backs.

Orin soon discovers a buried sword hilt that has a ""magical"" energy blade that can cut through anything.  Sound's like a light saber to me...

Well, Orin does escape, although his friend Elan dies in the process.  On the outside Orin quickly discovers how much his people have been deceived.

He meets up with Dagg, the film's Han Solo, and they have a lot of adventure together.  There's also an android named Silica, the film's C-3P0.  Dagg's ship Arthur is cool and reminds me of the ship from Disney's ""The Navigator"".

Well, long story short Orin becomes the hero he is destined to be.  It turns out he is some sort of spiritual warrior, a Ka-Khan, and he has great powers.  He's a Jedi basically...

Orin returns to Trinia, frees his people, kills Zygon once and for all and his people are finally freed from slavery and their belief in a false god.

--In Conclusion--

All-in-all this is a good movie.  Heavily influenced by 'Star Wars' to say the least, but still good.  Good action, good Sci-Fi elements as well: robots, cyborgs, space ships, aliens, etc.

Is this own worthy?  I certainly think so.  But be advised I only paid like 5 bucks for mine off Amazon's Marketplace.  I see currently that this film is going for around 10 to 15 bucks.  I would personally only pay top dollar, 8 bucks.  Shop around, check FYE, and other movie stores.  This is out of print now, so numbers are dwindling...

If you would like to sample it first, it should still be on Youtube somewhere.  I believe Youtube is still safe for movie watching, I don't do it myself anymore.  With Youtube you have to put up with annoying ads now, and I'm am not sure if adware is installed on your PC or not...  This is up to you, whether you want to watch it here or not.

However you choose to watch this lost gem, make sure and see it.  There is quite a treasure trove of forgotten movies out there, so if your sick of the crap we are subjected to these days, as am I, start looking backward into the older films.  I guarantee you'll find something you never knew existed.  Trust me, these old films are better than what we have today.",1340236800,,4414,4.567049808429119
322662,4,6301254961,"This is a strange film to write a review for-- it's incredibly cheesy, but at the same time it's very impressive from a technical perspective. It's got some of the best rotoscoped character animation you're going to see in a film from this period (I'd argue it's even better than what I saw in Ralph Bakshi's ""Fire and Ice,"" which I consider to be said director's best work), and it has some very cutting edge effects employed for its animated starships, and to top it all of this was the first animated feature to be released in 3D. Where the movie shows its cheesiness though is in the character designs and story. It moves along at a somewhat sluggish pace, and the writers weren't afraid of embracing the cheesiness often associated with the sci-fi genre.

Basically, imagine that all the people who made the cheesy 80s cartoons we loved and grew up with got together and made a sci-fi movie-- that's basically what this is. Look up some of the crew's filmographies on IMDB, and you'll see a lot of familiar titles-- the members of this diverse lot have worked on everything from He-Man to Dino-Riders to GI Joe and beyond. If you love 80s cartoons, and you can enjoy sci-fi with a good slice of cheese, you're probably going to love this movie. I bought it on a blind-buy and I'm very happy I did. It's a peculiar little gem whose flaws are part of what make it enjoyable, as was the case with many of the cartoons of my childhood that I still love to this day.",1329609600,,1466,4.449814126394052

It stuck with me and eventually became a huge influence on me and my franchise Gates, which is an online comic and transmedia franchise. The first part, the comic, is presented by Heavy Metal Magazine. [...]
The story, the characters and the animation are really tight and very reflective of the 80's. Some people call it a Star Wars rip off but I feel it has many nods to classic sci-fi. And a dude falls in love with a robot chick so how bad could it be? Anyway, love this movie, it holds a dear place in my heart. Highly recommend.

322665,2,6301254961,"Orin is a mine slave, working in the mines with his girlfriend and younger brother, when one day he digs up a sword.  The sword starts him on a quest to find freedom for his people from the evil robot overlords who hold them enthralled.  On his journey he meets swamp monsters, a smuggler with a heart of gold who kind of looks like Jack Webb from Dragnet, his gay AI space ship, a reprogrammed fembot and a dead girlfriend replacement lady- I mean the daughter of the local intergalactic governor.

With their help, Orin is able to travel to new places, learn more about the world outside the mines, and show off how terribly naive he is.  His enemy, the well drawn and evil Zygon, will stop at nothing to capture Orin and his magic sword in order to complete his plans of total domination of all organic life.

Sounds exciting, but this hour and forty minute movie drags an already bland story through the boring mills and emerges with a directionless, meandering story that takes too long to arrive at its patently obvious destination. The characters are mostly cardboard, and the villain is singularly ineffective at his task in some ways, and every character, hero and villain alike, occasionally suffer from plot convenient idiocy.  Also, there is an annoying firefly thing with horrible tinkly piano synth sound effects that shows up occasionally and solves the hero's problems.  It is a sparkly little deus ex machina that helps mainly to break the plot. If I were ten I probably would have loved this movie, though, at least once it leaves the mines.  It's not innovative in its story, and the characters are bland, but the animation is wonderful, especially for an 80's movie.  It's almost worth watching for the animation, and there are occasional moments of  humor as well, several of which are probably unintentional, but I take what I can get.

Pros: Great animation, even if it is a little slow moving in the action scenes, pretty nice settings and character designs.  The robot ship and the fembot have some decent chemistry

Cons: Boring and directionless plot that is heavily reliant on deus ex machinas and cliches.

Overall it's just bland.  Not good enough to be interesting, and not bad enough to be entertaining.  It is a shining example of mediocrity.",1313539200,,2275,4.750636132315521
322666,1,6301254961,"Back in 1985 I saw this movie one time in the theater with my high school friends.  I was about 17.  For 25 years I have remembered really liking the movie, but for reasons I could not put my finger on.  I am a Hard SciFi fan and have been since I discovered this magical place as a boy that gives away all the books you want for free, called a library...  Heinlen, Asimov, Niven.

For a long time I wondered about this movie, and just recently figured out its name and got it here on Amazon.  Well I don't know how this piece of putrid filth made it past my trained palette into a warm place in my heart for 25 years but now that I have rewatched it I feel dirty inside.

""Derivitive"" doesn't begin to describe it.  Many scenes are pulled directly from the Star Wars trilogy: the boy from a backwards planet is given a SciFi sword by an old man who tells him he needs to follow him and save the galaxy.  He then comes across a gruff, streetwise smuggler with a ship who gets him off his backwards planet, where he meets a princess who falls for him.  He then needs to fight a climactic battle to save the galaxy.  Even the ship sounds and laser sounds are exactly the same as the Star Wars trilogy.

The ending is anti climatic and contrived.  The princess who meets him for the first time ever falls for him and proclaims her love having known him for a couple of hours.  There are very few memorable scenes or graphics, the Japanese had better cartoon movies in the 1970's.  The man-droids and the fembot are slightly creative, but not worth a 2 hour movie.  The characters are so one dimensional and predicable if they turned to the side they would disappear.

I don't know how this movie made the good impression on me that it did in 1985, but its long, long gone now.",1285891200,,2094,4.7032967032967035
322667,3,6301254961,"Hoping to capitalize on the success of the original Star Wars trilogy, this foreign movie was put together as one of the first ever animated films to blend computer & standard animation. It was also one of the very first animated 3-D movies.

Set in the far off future, a society of humans is subjegated by an underground cult who use them as slaves for mining. The youthful Orin finds a sword one day while mining, and a vision appears from it of an old man claiming that there is a world beyond there own, and once the blade of the sword is found, then their people will be free. The blade then disappears, and Orin sets out to look at the world above. In the escape, his lover Elan is killed by the cult leader, the super-strong Zygon. Orin makes it to the surface, and is almost cannibalized by some Mandroids, but uses the sword to get away, as it creates a blade of pure energy when needed(aka: a Lightsaber!). He is rescued by Dagg, a space smuggler and this movie's obligatory Han Solo character. Dagg takes him to a military station, but Zaigon's robots are after them, so Dagg makes off with a bootylicious fembot called Silica, who he reprograms to be more agreeable. After a pitstop at a smugglers' city, the crew gets shot down by Zygon's robot goons, and Dagg gets captured. Orin is found by Avaiana(a buxom clone of Teela from He-Man)who is the daughter of the planet's governor. She revives him and helps him learn about the history of his mysterious sword. It was an ancient deus ex machina used to free the galaxy time and again from evil overlords, the last of which was a tyrant known as Nexus. Aviana then leads Orin to the head of the mining operation, which she thought was completely run by robots. The one running it is in fact Zygon, who reveals himself to be the long-thought dead Nexus in a robot body. He has been infiltrating the entire galaxy with his loyal robots and androids for years, and is planning on making his final push to take over the galaxy. Through some major ""use the Force"" mojo, Orin manages to pull his crap together along with Dagg and Aviana to stop Zygon, and liberate his people.

Starchaser was done with a little bit of the same treatment as Heavy Metal as it was mostlyy intended for older audiences. Sorta like if you had grown up on Star Wars and wanted to see something a little more mature in a sci-fi/adventure. The animation is actually pretty good for the mid-80s. It's not Akira, but around the same quality as Transformers: The Movie. I'd say that this one is at least a rental for fans of cheesy space flicks like Barbarella or Flash Gordon(but which are actually good!).",1279152000,,2637,4.491666666666666

Eventually Orin meets the princess Aviana (Noelle North) and learns the shocking truth about Zygon.  Now it's up to him to not only free his own society but to prevent the whole of humanity from falling under the rule of...no, you'd better watch the movie to find out.

Like most non-Disney animation, this one leaves something to be desired technically, but the spaceships are great, and despite its derivativeness it's surprisingly engaging, with just enough variation from the original to make it intriguing.  (Instead of Sandpeople, for example, Orin is imperilled by ""mandroids,"" beings that are part flesh (not all by any means human) and part machine.)",1271980800,,1929,5.360927152317881
322670,5,6301254961,"I just can't believe I had never seen this movie before. As an adult animation fan that loves popular to obscure animation, when well done, I only recently heard about this film and ordered it. It is a sci-fi adventure from 1985, with all the trimmings of space opera cinema... robots good and bad, interplanetary travel in spaceships, a talking ship, monsters, battles galore, slaves and smugglers, assassins, betrayal, a princess, a magic sword, its' all here.

But more importantly, the producers did a good job on pulling together the right elements of an animated film. Starting with a decent story/script is the most important step, and they hit the mark there. The story is exciting and never drags. The character development is good, and the voice acting is top-notch. The animation is great, and I am sure I have seen the work of whoever did the art concept design somewhere before, it looks very similar to an early segment in Heavy Metal. The animation is very clean and fluid, not rushed or crude. The DVD presentation was very good. It has obviously been cleaned up with sound and video remastered compared to VHS version. It does not have any extras, and that is a shame as I would have loved to learn more about the production.
It has a few veiled adult references and some deaths, but nothing to keep your kids from watching it safely. It's a keeper for my collection and I recommend it to yours.",1262131200,,1412,4.670682730923695
322671,5,6301254961,"I have been looking for this movie for several years. Every time I see it I see something new. The animation was really top notch for the time it was made. It has everything: good guys, bad guys, a love interest comic relief and most imporantly a plot. I highly recommend it .",1233273600,,276,4.226415094339623

322683,4,6301254961,"STARCHASER: THE LEGEND OF ORIN was a space opera in the vein of the STAR WARS saga, unlike the EWOKS/DROIDS series, better animated. The story is generic: a young hero battles against a intergalactic lord, meets up with a smuggler with his own agenda and a lovely princess he falls in love with. The animation is grand. I only wish there was more done with STARCHASER. Only time will tell. Above all, I highly recomend it.",1208822400,,422,4.565789473684211
322684,4,6301254961,"I first saw this film at the theater when I was a teenager back in 1985. It was originally shown in 3-D (a RARITY back then - WAY before the time of IMAX). Wow! I absolutely LOVED this film! I love both sci-fi and animated films, so when the 2 genres were combined for this movie, I knew I was in for a treat.

When I saw it was available on DVD, I snatched it up without hesitation. I watched it again recently and discovered that it was quite dated (in terms of animation techniques) and a shameless rip-off of the original Star Wars.

Despite those flaws, this movie is just plain FUN. The background animation is gorgeous to look at, the story (although familiar) is told in a logical and exciting way, and there's plenty of action. Though probably geared for teens and pre-teens, the story does not ""talk down"" to the audience. There is danger, a bit of mild violence, mild profanity (one of the characters uses the word ""damn"" about 50 times!), and some characters actually die.

Compared to today's modern animation techniques, Starchaser will seem a bit archaic, but the visuals are still very pleasing to the eye and most of the character's movements are fluid and life-like. Many of the sound effects are ""borrowed"" from Star Wars (you'll recognize a lot of them), but probably the most dated element is the electronic soundtrack that just REEKS of '80s cheesiness. But, hey! IT WORKS!

The movie, althought not ""great"", is a pleasant experience that you may want to pop into the player from time to time. It's also something you can enjoy with the kids who will no doubt laugh at certain scenes and say the word ""cool"" or ""awesome"" about a dozen times. Hey! What other words would you use to describe '80s entertainment? I can't think of any! (Well, maybe ""knarly"" or ""radical"" but I think those words have been retired - unless you're a surfer? I'll shut up now.)",1188172800,,1875,4.571428571428571
322685,3,6301254961,"We bought Starchaser - Legend of Orin for our 4-year-old grandson because he loves robot movies. I watched it with him. He loved it. I enjoyed it also. He took it home with him and he watches it over and over and over. He doesn't really understand the story yet, but it's a worthy story -- good vs. evil, coming of age, saving a civilization -- and when he does, that'll be good also. The animation is very, very good.",1184803200,2,418,4.2375

Wonderful cartoon type movie about a boy that was raised in the mines of a furture world. He finds a way out and discovers all about life above as well as his desire for revenge, to go back for his brother, and that not all things are as they seem. Very funny moments, action, some blood and death scenes are well.  All in all, a great movie that you'll watch again and again.",1181260800,,559,3.793103448275862
322688,3,6301254961,"I purchased this one because I enjoyed it as a kid.  I watched it with my son (11) and he enjoyed it, too.  Kind of like a Star Wars type-story that's animated, with the young naive hero setting off on an adventure to save his people from oppression with the help of a smuggler with a ""heart of gold.""  Decent animation, though not what is available nowadays.  Interesting characters and storyline with a happy ending.  Some shoot-outs and explosions but not a lot of violence - plenty of action.",1180051200,,496,4.52808988764045

During his mission, he joins up with a smuggler named ""Dagg"", two robots ""Arthur"" & fembot "" Silica"" and a beautiful princess to save his home planet, defeat Zygon and free the people of the mine-world.

Often refered to as a ""Star Wars"" rip-off, but i think this is a wonderfully animated and nicely made animated Korean/US produced Sci-fi fantasy romp for adults ( not really for kids). For it's time, it contained some early CGI and was originally in 3-D, But still i think it's a wonderful animated movie that i recommend for fans of ""Star Wars"", Sci-fi, fantasy and animation alike.

7810546,5,6301254961,"This was a staple of my childhood. At an age when I was oblivious to the opinions of film critics, and only in tune with my father's cinematic preferences (all the sci-fi/fantasy, all the time!), I clung to this film, along with the animated version of The Hobbit, a few lesser known ninja animes (i'm still trying to track one of them down), and a few well-known animes.

For some time, I couldn't find Starchaser, and no one I knew personally ever heard of it. Even my dad's copy was literally a copy he recorded onto vhs.  Finally, a simple Amazon search revealed a few used copies for sale, this one being the most reasonably priced (relatively). And lo, it was meant to pass, that Bradford would own a dvd copy of one of the greatest childhood memories.

From a critic's perspective, this film is very much a Star Wars wanna-be, and plagued with cheesy lines, poor pacing, and blatant sexism. But hidden underneath are some touching moments, and a few surprises. It's worth a watch, even if you don't want to own it. I'm just glad that i do.",1519171200,,1046,4.494736842105263
