Again, the actors were stale and untrained and yes the cursing returned. The plot was very, very weak. Noelle seemed to just fall into peer pressure with no reasoning or resistance and no sooner than she fell, she was very quickly redemmed after only one conversation with her pastor. Sorry, but this is just not real life. People don't simply fall into sin, they back-slide (it's a process). Oftentime, when we are redemmed, it is also a process of healing and forgiveness.

I hated the fact that Tosha's character was not explored further, she and her Mom had issues that were quickly wrapped up at the end with no inside story. Also, the script; was this improve or were there actual lines? The characters seemed to be feeling their way. The sound again was off...Varying from too LOUD to What is that noise? Larry, i'm tired of complaining; this is just not your calling. You have no passion, no vision, and obviously no patience for writing and producing good movies. Save yourself and these poor wannabe actors the shame. Vow to never make another movie!!!! I don't know how I tricked myself into watching the sequel to the already poorly written original. Thank God I got this free on Netflix this time around. I will never make this mistake again.",1319328000,2,1372,4.669421487603306
8228633,5,B000XJD35W,"I saw part 1 and part 2, but part 2 is my favorite! It really has a good message and encourages people to never give up on the Lord. It also shows that if you do leave Him, He will give you a second chance if you will humbly ask Him for it through repentance. All-in-all, this is a great message for high school and college students, primarily high school seniors who will soon be going off to college.",1306281600,2,402,4.10126582278481
8228634,4,B000XJD35W,I believe it will help young people to see that once they are out on their own some tough decisions have to be made.,1276646400,,116,3.875
8228635,3,B000XJD35W,A really good play for high school students or christians who are back sliding from GOD.,1205020800,2,88,4.5625
