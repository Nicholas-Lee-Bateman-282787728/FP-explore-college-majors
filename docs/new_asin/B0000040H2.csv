1182441,5,B0000040H2,"BOTTOM LINE: Probably my favorite Neil Simon film. There are some dazzling exchanges of (brilliantly written) dialogue in this film. The acting is what makes this film so great, no doubt. (Neither of these people are particularly attractive.) Simon's writing here is razor-sharp, if not entirely believable. I mean, no one talks this cleverly & quickly off the cuff, but it sure would be nice to be that witty! Practically every line is quotable. Blu-ray is a minimal WB effort, but at least it's finally available in hi-def, with much-improved audio/video quality over the old DVD. And guys, don't worry. This is NOT just a chick flick. I think you'll enjoy it, too. It's fun & funny. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains minor spoilers): Elliot Garfield, a struggling young actor from Chicago, arrives in New York for his first shot at Broadway (well... off-off Broadway). He's sub-let an apartment from an acting acquaintance, Tony Deforest, (who flew off to Europe himself only the day before to pursue his dreams of an acting career, after landing a part in a major Italian film production). This works out great for both guys. There's a slight complication however, as said apartment still has a couple of occupants: Paula McFadden, Tony's now ex-girlfriend, and her 10 year-old daughter, Lucy. It seems Paula, (Marsha Mason), has a bad habit of falling for the wrong kind of guy. In her case it's actors. She's been burned twice now because of her self-proclaimed weakness for falling for their charm & charisma. When Paula discovers that in addition to her self-absorbed jerk of an ex having just leased their (his) apartment out from under her, the new guy she's about to be forced to share her life with is... another actor!?! As you can imagine, the sparks fly! Turns out Elliot himself has recently been dumped on, romantically. He's just moved to a new town, knows no one and yet plans to start the very next day (talk about confident!) on what he believes will be a rising, successful career in one of the smallest, most ruthlessly competitive job markets imaginable. Paula & Elliot have both been shaken by their past mistakes; unstable personally, socially, economically & professionally. These two people are bitter from bad previous relationships and neither one is looking to start another. Things are going to get a lot worse before they get any better!

THOUGHTS: Mom dragged me to the theater to see this back in 1976, at the tender age of 10. Thought I'd hate it, ended up really enjoying it, despite myself. Dreyfus was absolutely on fire here, earning the 1976 Best Actor Academy Award for his energetic portrayal of Elliot Garfield. The scene where Paula & Elliot iron out ""the rules"" of their shared apartment is a classic one. So too is the scene where Paula comes to Elliot asking for help when Lucy gets sick. (Dreyfus' energy level is particularly impressive here. He wrings the dialogue out with so much power that he's literally drained and out of breath at one point). The scene between Dreyfus and Paul Benedict (next door neighbor 'Mr. Bentley' on ""The Jeffersons""), when Elliot balks at playing Richard III as a flaming homosexual, terrified of what it will do to his fragile career, is simultaneously sad & hilarious. I could go on and on. So many scenes are perfection and the dialogue is delivered with such mastery; it's hard to believe that Dreyfus was only 30 at the time. Mason is good too and tries to hold her own, (succeeding, for the most part), but she is a distant 2nd to Dreyfus, who was at his all-time best in this film. In addition to the exhaustive verbal fencing, Dreyfus impresses in the film's quieter moments, too. For example: when Paula & Lucy come backstage after his disastrous opening night, he cannot even bring himself to say anything; you can see the shame & humiliation on his face and in his eyes. Great stuff. Dreyfus wrings the maximum amount of satire & irony out of his performance. His chemistry with Mason is predictably good but, surprisingly, so are his scenes with 10 year-old Quinn Cummings. She shines as Paula's street-smart daughter, Lucy. It's too bad Cummings didn't do more film work of this caliber. She appeared to be poised for stardom with this movie but just sort of stumbled along for a few more years, doing bit parts and TV work, and then just dropped off the radar back in 1991. Herbert Ross directs the film with a minimum of flash. Knowing he had some great talent in front of the camera, he wisely kept the attention on them and not on needless fancy visual nonsense.

THE BLU-RAY: Hi-def release is a welcome, if measly, barebones affair. But at least the picture & sound are worlds improved over the equally limp DVD version! It's a shame that Warner didn't spend a little $$$ to inject this Blu-ray offering with some decent supplements. Retrospective interviews with the cast & crew would've been nice, while they're all still around. Dreyfus won an Oscar for this movie. It would be nice to see a current interview with him reminiscing about the film, and/or even a running audio commentary. Oh, well. Maybe someday. For now this is all we've got.",1515801600,,5141,4.774157303370787

It's Easter Sunday, we didn't really need this.  We stopped watching and figured we'd take the loss on paying for this trash.  We've loved Richard's  work, but can't get to the end of this to see if he redeems him self from these two Godless women.  Dreyfuss, a great actor.  Mason can't act, delivers her lines rehearsed, except for profanity, real natural.  To bad they drug the little girl into potty-mouth!",1492387200,,694,4.569105691056911

As a former studied theatrical actor, I find this film exhibits Dreyfuss's finest performance of which many have never witnessed; consequently receiving his first Academy Award for this piece in 1977.

The chemistry, expression and the execution of comedic timing between Dreyfuss and Mason is impeccable and is a perfect flow, reflecting the hilarious and emotional nature of the characters as they are thrown together in their predicaments. Neil Simon's genius is not lost for a second in this movie. It is a classic and I would recommend this flick to anyone starting out on stage and/or pursuing a film career. A delight to watch, simply ace all the way!",1491609600,,806,4.926470588235294

1182477,4,B0000040H2,"I saw this in the theatres when it was first released, and thought it was okay for what it was.  It was a ""grown up"" film about grown ups doing grown up things and making witty intellectual remarks about their lives and each others' lives while trying to live with one another and ""make it"" in the Big Apple.

It's more of a charming film than a funny film, but charming it is, and even if you don't like New York, Neil Simon, witty urban rapport, then the characters should bring you into their little world and all it entails.

When it comes down to it this film is just about life, and how wonderful it might be if people overcome their objections to one another by showing a little humanity.  It is a comedy, so you can't take it too seriously, but it is fun to look at people getting along after being shafted by a self seeking adventurer.

1182486,5,B0000040H2,"The Goodbye Girl is a romantic comedy by Neil Simon, originally released in 1977. Dancer Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend. But one day, he deserts her to go to Italy for an acting job. Before he left, however  and without Paulas knowledge  her boyfriend subleased the apartment to Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a neurotic aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Though this initial meeting doesnt go well, Elliot allows Paula and Lucy to stay.

Neil Simon was at his peak when he wrote the screenplay for The Goodbye Girl having written many hits on Broadway, including Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Brighton Beach Memoirs, and Laughter on the 23rd Floor. His masterful comic touch is evident throughout The Goodbye Girl. Eventually, over time, with a number of hiccups along the way, Paula and Elliot realize they love each other, but its the journey to that realization that provides lots of humor and oddball situations.

One of the strangest scenes involves an avant grade production of Richard III Elliot is rehearsing. The director insists that Richard should be played as a flaming gay man, offering a significant share of the movies laughs. Early scenes of three people trying to make the best of living together also provide chuckles, as Elliot has a few eccentricities that take getting used to. But Simon also has the ability to write believable, quiet moments between Paula and Elliot, with gentler humor and budding affection brewing. Dreyfuss, fresh off Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, won the Best Oscar for his performance in this film.

There are no bonus features on the Blu-ray release.",1486944000,,1789,4.989932885906041

Richard Dreyfuss performance as Elliot is quite touching and set against Marsha Mason's performance quite brilliant. It's easy to see why he won an Academy award. Miss Mason herself played a vulnerable but protective mother who was so afraid the relationship with Elliot wasn't for real. Quinn Cummings was quite delightful playing the precocious Lucy.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE GOODBYE GIRL [1977] is a totally brilliant Neil Simon vehicle and even more brilliant in the hands of the director Herbert Ross. Its tough to make a film that juggles heartbreak, insecurity, childhood, and the hesitation thats inherent to moving on after disaster strikes at your core. Its tough at the same time to make a film about those kinds of topics, and still have it be very funny and heart-warming, to a point of getting the Kleenex tissues out. Written by Neil Simon and directed by Hollywood veteran Herbert Ross, better known for popular films such as Funny Lady and Footloose and of course THE GOODBYE GIRL accomplishes such a feat in just under two hours.

Led brilliantly by a cast featuring that always incredible Richard Dreyfuss, and his co-star Marsha Mason, THE GOODBYE GIRL drops us into the middle of an unexpected breakup. Broadway dancer Paula McFadden finds herself broken up with and homeless after her previous partner heads for Europe, subletting his apartment to an inspiring actor from Chicago, Elliot Garfield. Immediately, Paula clashes with him, fighting to keep the apartment for herself and her daughter Lucy, and Elliot reluctantly agrees. Together, beyond their ferocious attitudes towards each other, they must figure out what it takes to be successful in the vicious theatre community of New York City, Paula struggling to regain her former career, and Elliot finding out for the first time just how hostile and frustrating Broadway can be. They must fight tooth and nail to live with comfort in the Big Apple, and maybe even find love in the process.

The THE GOODBYE GIRL film follows the typical romantic comedy plot line, in which two unlike individuals clash and over the course of the next hour or so melt each others guard away to fall into a passionate love for one another, but does so with that classic Neil Simon edge that manages to be funny, but realistic at the same time. Our two leading actors watch their lives fall apart, as Elliot Garfield [Richard Dreyfuss] has his dreams of being an Off-Broadway star crushed, and Paula McFadden [Marsha Mason] realizing she cant easily fit back into the life she gave up to be with her daughter Lucy McFadden [Quinn Cummings]. We get to watch as they struggle with the low points in their careers, and then relish as things begin to look up for everyone as the film cleanly and warmly wraps itself up.

THE GOODBYE GIRL is an actor/actresss film, laden with brilliant sharp dialogue rather than exciting visual sequences, almost as if its a play, which Neil Simon frequently wrote. More often than not, the film hinges on the performance of lead actor Richard Dreyfuss, who plays his role with such a fine balance between broken and casual, resulting in several scene stealing sequences including a rather inspired performance of the lead role in Richard III, and his various interactions with Paula McFaddens daughter Lucy McFadden which are played to great comedic effect. Richard Dreyfuss performance is so strong that it makes it difficult at times to care about the struggles Paula McFadden is facing, making her seem insignificant whereas Richard Dreyfuss oozes charisma all over Neil Simons script. It led to him receiving an Academy Award for Best Actor for his masterful performance, cementing his presence as a Hollywood legend, while Marsha Masons performance has largely sadly become forgotten over the years.

THE GOODBYE GIRL is extremely well edited, tightly paced heart-warming film that drags us through the lows and highs of an easily relatable odd couple in New York City that equates to comfort food for film-goers. The consequences are light, but the edge of disaster is just close enough to make the film a compelling watch. In the final analysis, with a witty screenplay by Neil Simon and an excellent cast, THE GOODBYE GIRL had the pieces in place for an utterly appealing romantic comedy. Lightly directed by Herbert Ross, Neil Simon's apartment-sharing scenario uniting a wary single mother with a struggling actor finds the humour in a quintessentially contemporary milieu of serial relationships, commitment-phobia, and New York real estate to add to the scenario. Marsha Mason revealed her talent for comedy as well as dramatic emotion in her performance as Paula McFadden, while newcomer Quinn Cummings was charmingly self-assured as her young daughter, Lucy McFadden. Rising star Richard Derfusss Elliott was both broadly hilarious playing an ill-conceived Richard III and charmingly sensitive as the male romantic lead. This wonderful film is greeted as a straightforward piece of joyful escapism and a joy to watch.

Finally, the reason I love this film is because of the following Memorable Quotes from THE GOODBYE GIRL that goes as follows:

""I'm paying the rent. I'll make the rules. I like to take showers every morning, and I don't like the panties drying on the rod! I like to cook, so I'll use the kitchen whenever I damn well please. And I'm very particular about my condiments, so keep your salt and pepper to yourself. Plus, I play the guitar in the middle of the night whenever I cannot sleep, and I meditate every morning complete with chanting and burning incense, so if you've got to walk around, I would appreciate a little tiptoeing. Also, I sleep in the nude  buffo  winter and summer, rain or snow, with the window open. And because I may have to go to the potty or the fridge in the middle of the night, and because I don't want to put on jammies, which I do not own in the first place, unless you're looking for a quick thrill or your daughter an advanced education, I'd keep my door closed. Them's my rules and regulations. How does that grab you?""

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection presents this brilliant film with a very pleasant 1080p encoded image, especially for a film that was released in 1977 and they have done a really wonderful job and was originally shot on 4-perf 35mm film using spherical Panavision lenses. The film is presented here in in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and slightly more open than the original theatrical aspect ratio from this new HD master. THE GOODBYE GIRL is more like a filmed play than it is a cinematic experience. The cinematography therefore serves not to tell the story, but to simply frame the players on screen. There isn't any particularly striking use of colour or camera work, and the shooting style embraces the softness of 1970s era spherical lenses. The film has an even layer of grain throughout the entire feature, and the print is impeccably clean. Colour pushes towards the more naturalistic end of the spectrum, but looks healthy. Overall, this is an excellent presentation by Warner Archive Collection.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection presents this brilliant film with an excellent 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono audio experience. The films sound presentation is effective, in that it presents the dialogue very clearly, and nothing gets lost in the mono audio mix presentation. The limited use of music composed by Dave Grusin is presented very well. Overall, I was very satisfied with this audio track. But what a shame they could not of upgraded the sound presentation to stereo.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1977] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:45] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for THE GOODBYE GIRL. Despite a very grainy video presentation, the trailer is a brilliant presentation of a film that came out in 1977 and one that makes you want to watch this feel good rom-com film

Finally, THE GOODBYE GIRL became an unexpected brilliant hit, and earned several Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Screenplay. Herbert Ross was nominated for directing The Turning Point [1977] instead. The 29-year-old Richard Dreyfuss took home the Best Actor statuette, becoming the youngest winner of the award and was well deserved. Re-watching THE GOODBYE GIRL was a breath of fresh air, and here is a film that is totally compassionate, yet realistically shows that you can be found through two vastly different people daring to emotionally opening themselves to one another. It is a variant on The Odd Couple and of course Neil Simon cleverly manages to get more mileage out of the same theme is explored and ends up as a sweet-natured, nice, and a good old fashioned romantic comedy in which the stars are perfectly paired. Especially with Richard Dreyfus and his twinkling acting that is added with his brash energy like some latter-day James Cagney and gets most of the laughs and leaves Marsha Mason with a very touching performance. Very Highly Recommended!

1182539,4,B0000040H2,"A first-rate performance by the whole cast.  I loved Richard Dreyfuss' interpretation of Eliot Garfield and Marsha Mason is equally at the top of her game with Paula McFadden.  Quinn Cummings proved her weight in gold as Paula's daughter Lucy, despite being a preteen.  The main thing I object to is the continual use of God's name in vain, even with Cummings' character which is supposed to be funny, but I found it particularly discouraging.  I understand that's how a lot of people talk, and not everyone views this issue the same way I do, but I really felt it diminished the enjoyment factor significantly for me, in what could have been an otherwise very entertaining story.  When Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton did a rendition of this movie in the last 20 years, while I still favor this version over that I still loved Daniels'/Heaton's performances, and the fact that the language was toned down really helped me enjoy their movie just as much.  Neil Simon's stories obviously have a lot to do with studying human behavior, particularly with conflicting personality types, and while I think there is questionable morality in almost every one of his plays/movies, I can't deny he does a fine job of highlighting how every person underneath still wants to be loved and respected.  I would list ""The Good-bye Girl"" as a favorite, definitely as a rival to ""The Odd Couple,"" Simon's most famous work.",1471564800,,1406,4.833333333333333

1182575,5,B0000040H2,"Sappy? Yes! - but in a most delightful way. This is an all-time favorite for this sap-happy viewer, and with good reason. The three main players were in top form: Richard Dreyfuss, who won an Academy Award for best actor - as an actor playing an actor...and nominations for Marsha Mason at her most vulnerable and delightful, and a scene-stealing young Quinn Cummings delivered a performance belying the tender age of 10. I can't imagine this being cast any better, which turns out to be ironic. According to Wikipedia, the original screen play, penned by Mason's husband, Neil Simon, was a much different concept called ""Bogart Slept Here,"" starring Robert DeNiro. But one actor change and screenplay re-write later, we said hello to ""The Goodbye Girl."" Despite now being nearly 40 years old, anyone with even basic exposure to NYC living and the Broadway scene can still appreciate some of its timeless references - and even if not, the chemistry between Dreyfuss, Mason & Cummings also stands the test of time. But all you really need is to love a sappy, happy ending. ""The Goodbye Girl"" deliver on all counts.",1461715200,,1113,4.863157894736842

1182703,5,B0000040H2,"THE GOODBYE GIRL is a delightful step back in time when life was simpler but not without its problems. Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) is about to leave New York City for Los Angeles with her boyfriend Tony and her precocious 10-year-old Lucy (Quinn Cummings). There is only one problem. Tony has abandoned them for an acting job in Italy while subletting the apartment to a struggling actor named Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss). Two honest and decent people are now in a major dilemma. Who gets the apartment? The simple solution? Share the apartment.
Here is where this sweet romantic comedic hearkens back to a kinder and gentler time. In today's world, what responsible single mother would let a complete stranger move in with her and her daughter on the spot?
In THE GOODBYE GIRL, it all makes sense to follow such a course of action. Paula and scruffy Elliot have an instant attraction to each other. It all works. Mason never looked lovelier with her sweet but determined girl next door look.  THE GOODBYE GIRL is simply delightful and a must see feel good film about love and compromise.",1443744000,,1097,4.804232804232805

It is one of the funniest, most poignant, moving and enjoyable Romantic Comedies that is a non-romantic comedy I've ever seen.

1182880,5,B0000040H2,One of my favorite romance movies & great casting with Marsha Mason (of Chapter Two with James Caan) and Richard Dreyfuss- in another one of his best movies.

1182884,5,B0000040H2,"Sometimes for fun, I read the one star reviews to see other people's opinion that differ from mine.  Some of the comments were so strong and serious, I mean after all, this is just a movie.  And a great one at that.  One person said the quips were too sharp and fast.  I think that is a complement to Neil Simon who I think was a genius when it came to screenplays.  Perhaps it is too witty for today's movie audience.  And I like the fact that they were not scared to cast an actor and actress that would never be placed in such roles today because they don't look like Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.  I don't care what those one star critics say, this is a great movie.  By the way, this movie plot would not work today because the world is different now than it was in 1977.  Another reason not to judge this movie too harshly.",1423872000,,837,4.18125

1182953,5,B0000040H2,"I love these two together--Dreyfuss and Mason.  This is such a wonderful love story.  The song at the end of the movie ""The Goodby Girl"" is one of my favorites.  I love to play it on the piano and when I play it I think of the days of my youth when I saw this movie.  I guess it is a woman's movie about love and loss and regaining love again.  That is about all it is about and that is enough if it is well acted.

The only thing I hate in the movie is the part where Richard Dreyfuss has to act on stage in a play that is poorly directed.  I really hate that part.  Every other part of the movie is ""sweet memories"".  I love the phone booth scenes.  I love the carriage ride with his to be daughter and her friend.  It is one of those movies that you keep year after year and you pull it out when you want to day dream.
Dreyfuss never came across very sexy in movies but in this one he is sexy.  He is young and full of energy and just delightful to watch.",1397347200,,958,3.8316326530612246

I remember seeing this movie at the theatre in the summer of 1977. Richard Dreyfus' character (Elliott)was so annoying that I could not picture a romance happening with him and Marsha Mason (Paula). Through the move, he kinda grows on you and by the end you can see that they are meant for each other.

Not because I have no life, but its a simple movie. No violence, no sex, no foul language, no REAL drama. No one dies. Just a simple little love story.",1392595200,,503,4.177083333333333

Like Marsha's character, you will many times over not trust anyone.  But Richard's character was really funny & how he reacted with Marsha's daughter ""Lucy"" was really good.  Especially when ""Lucy"" was sick.  I think it's a really good movie to see when you need a good laugh on how life can be one moment & then change for the better in the next moment.  It also has parts that may make you cry.  But that's usually the case when they make these movies as ""chick-flicks"".

1182982,4,B0000040H2,"What makes a Neil Simon movie or play is superb writing. Simon is a master of verbal by-play. Back him with a cast and a director who understand timing and you have enough entertainment that you may even forget your popcorn.  Goodbye Girl is a case in point.
I had first seen this movie in first release in 1977. Richard Dreyfuss as a middle aged still optimistic actor was so convincing that I later had trouble accepting him in younger roles. His fey rendering of Richard III and follow-up performance of his character an unexpectedly drunk Elliot Garfield more than earn his Best Actor Award. However the center of this movie is Marsh Mason as Paula McFadden and her daughter the precocious Quinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden.

The McFadden women have been dumped on by a few too many men and are justifiably leery at the arrival of Elliot (yet another actor) into their lives and apartment.

Looking backwards from 2013; the placement of unlikely people in an apartment or hotel room is a regular Simon technique. Best remembered in his play/TV series The Odd Couple, Goodbye Girl is the same idea but with room for romance. Paula is too dependent on men and not sufficiently professional to control her re-entry into the work place. This character is a nester, having greater focus on the hominess of her apartment and the health of daughter and boyfriend. I can therefore understand if some viewers find this work dated.
That said, even Simon was impressed with his repartee. In at least two occasions he has a charter remark about the equality of conversation. Paula specifically notes that she would not like Elliot at all except for his skill with words. In general I have to agree. The banter keeps you alert and wanting more. There is chemistry between the leads. Not burn the house down take no prisoners lust, but a slower more mature, appreciation of each other's qualities.

This is not Great moviemaking, or the best of Neil Simon. These terms however place a needless high bar on the concept of enjoyment. This is a very enjoyable movie. Come for a relaxing entertainment and come back again later. The Goodbye Girl can warm you and entertain you even after several replays.",1385164800,,2188,4.75

It is not easy to come by so when I saw Amazon had it I couldn't wait to snap it up. It is worth almost anything.

Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss are wonderful and her daughter Lucy, (Quinn Cummings) is fantastic...what a performance, what a kid. She doesn't like being called kid by the way. The scenes detailing his performance in a staging of Richard III are hilarious and the director of that play (Paul Benedict) is, well, amazing. The song ""Goodbye Girl"" was a big hit for David Gates and it like everything else is great. Basically he and she are working on a relationship which begins accidentally, or is that incidentally and sure goes through lots of ups and downs and Marsha has many reason to doubt if anything good can come from it but well, the ending is all you could wish for and that kid,........what an ace.

1183047,5,B0000040H2,I think that this is a fantastic movie....one of Neil Simons very best.  Marsha Mason plays an aging dancer and Richard Dreyfuss an aspiring actor.  Marsha's broken romance with another actor has left her in an apartment that has been sublet by Dreyfuss and they have to come to an agreement on living arrangements.  This leads to some very funny and touching moments.  I think that if you haven't seen it you should.  An oldie but still a very good movie.,1361145600,,456,4.580246913580247

I like this movie because I like the song, which I then learned, recorded, and posted on the YOU TUBE web site, and at my own personal web site, ""OUR ETERNAL STRUGGLE"".

Today there are many horrid movies released each year that suck less than this one, but they don't win Oscars.  How bad movies must have been in 1978.",1347062400,,313,4.098360655737705

1183068,5,B0000040H2,"This is the only movie I have had any desire to watch multiple times. It came out my first year of college. Somehow it expresses all my longings and excitement about the future, as I viewed the world in 1977. There is such a beauty in this romantic connection. We've gotten away from the intelligent and creative openness, and the feminism, that was not just in this movie, but in the culture at this time. Both Mason and Dreyfuss's characters struggle, but always stay true to themselves. Somehow they find a way to fit, in spite of their quirkyness and histories of being ""dumpees."" I looked at the ""1"" votes here and find that their words fit with my review: ""self-absorbed, abrasive people."" Yes! And yet they find love. ""Neurotic, insipid, self-indulgent pseudo-eccentricity,"" and in another review, ""cloying."" Yes! It's all ok... Real people can be all these things. And the theme of trying to find the one who will stay is, unfortunately, one with perennial relevance.",1339718400,,975,4.844311377245509

1183073,5,B0000040H2,"Marsha Mason plays Paula McFadden, a down on her luck dancer who has had her fair share of ""goodbyes"" from men. However, her last one not only said goodbye to her but their apartment too as he sublets it to another tenant without her knowledge. Enter Elliott Garfield(Richard Dreyfuss with an interesting subplot) who is a Chicago actor who comes to New York expecting his ""big break"" as the star of an off Broadway play. He has a key, a lease, and too big of a heart to kick Paula and her 10-year-old daughter out. They come to an uneasy truce ( and I do mean uneasy) and try to stay out of each other's way, but in true comedies that is impossible. The verbal sparring is endless (and at times cruel), but tensions soften instantly when Elliott's opening night is so bad(financially and critically)  that it turns into closing night. The two eventually fall in love but once again she may face another ""goodbye"" when he is offered a movie role. The profanity is a bit strong for a PG rated movie, but the performances are worth the watch and if you like a good subplot then this is the one for you. Richard Dreyfuss won an Academy Award for his performance.
The theme song at the end as the credits roll is also touching and worth the watch.",1332979200,,1243,4.404347826086957
1183074,5,B0000040H2,"Let me start by saying, my mom took me to see this movie when I was around the same age as the little girl in the movie (Quinn Cummings).  It was in a very small theatre, and the people in the theatre could hear me non-stop laughing.  I really enjoyed this movie.  Since I am now married with children, I don't laugh as much when I watch it, but I could watch it over and over again and enjoy it.  I love the theme song, it really fit the movie.  My personal favorites are Richard Dreyfuss and his leaky phone booth, his chanting with burning incense, the panties drying on the rod, Marsha Mason working for the men from Subaro cars,  Dreyfuss as a bouncer,  Quinn's swearing when unexpected made it funny too.  This movie will always be dear to my heart.  For the people who have never had a chance to watch it,  please pick up a copy with Dreyfuss and Mason, do not watch the most recent one first (I personally didn't think it was any good, compare to this one.  This movie is not for children.  I would say teen and up only.  My oldest is 10 and I wouldn't let her watch this until she's in high school.  There are many adult situations.  But overall, it is really a movie that could be true to life and I found myself really getting into this movie and feeling really bad for Mason.  Don't worry though, the ending assures you happiness.  Please give this one a chance, you won't be disappointed.  It is definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time.",1330992000,,1467,4.253623188405797

Neil Simon's style of writing gets on my nerves very quickly. There is a lot of fast-paced dialogue and often bickering going on in his stories. These characters were not likeable. In fact, they were both pretty rude people. This business of Richard Dreyfuss coming home one day after he had gotten the black eye, suddenly being madly in love with Marsha Mason was totally unbelievable crap. Anyway, I was mildly entertained because it was so lame, that I gave it two stars instead of one. The kid was also pretty annoying.

Both take stances in their relationship that no sane person would, making it difficult to relate to these two.  Dreyfus is also saddled with, and we are condemned to watch, a few horrible scenes of an abysmal version of Richard the Third.

1183110,5,B0000040H2,"Paula (Mason) and her 10 year old daughter Lucy (Cummings) have just returned from a shopping spree. They're bubbly and excited because they're going to live in California. Then, Paula discovers a note.  It seems her actor-boyfriend, Tony, has dumped her and is going to Italy instead.

The bad news just keeps rolling in.  At midnight, Paula gets a call from a strange man.  It seems Elliot Garfield (Dreyfus) is an actor who's sublet the apartment from Tony and he wants to move in.

While possession may be nine-tenths of the law, Paula knows that the law is really on Elliot's side since he has the signed lease.  So they negotiate an arrangement that they'll be roommates.

This is not a likely pairing.  Paula really hates actors now since she's been dumped on them more than once.  But, as time goes on, the three bond.

Some really hilarious scenes here where Elliot gets stuck playing Richard III as a flaming queen instead of a King.  But the best lines are from young Quinn Cummings, who steals the show from the two veteran actors.

Well done movie and one of Neil Simon's absolute best.

The film takes the formula of THE ODD COUPLE (another wonderful film that examines the relationship between a pair of opposites trying to compromise in a living situation) with a twist.  Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) is an out-of-work dancer and single mother whose boyfriend has abandoned her and her young daughter, Lucy (Quinn Cummings)--not a surprise.  However, he also subletted the apartment to his out-of-work actor friend, Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss).  This wasn't what Paula had in mind.  This wasn't what Elliot had in mind.  Nevertheless, the eccentric Elliot--who chants and eats odd, diet specific food-- and the embittered Paula, who has vowed to stay away from actors--must agree to tolerate each other (to put it nicely). This doesn't come easily.

This film has so many wonderful and funny scenes, and Marsha Mason and Richard Dreyfuss have wonderful screen chemistry even when they are at each other's throats.  Wonderfully entertaining......Dreyfuss basically steals the movie.  You'll love it.",1173744000,,1111,5.450292397660819

One day Richard Dreyfus, in town to play Richard III in a very strange production, moves in with them because of a misunderstanding with the previous lessor (both he and Clayburgh claim the apartment is theirs). The scene is set for the classic clash of character: it's the old opposites attract, hatred overcome by love story. But the dialogue is right on target and very sharp, and Dreyfus is in top form in his maniacal role. Funny, poignant, well acted - it's an excellent, entertaining movie all around.

1183128,4,B0000040H2,"Did you know that the obnoxiously humorous fat cat,. Garfield, was invented by master cartoonist Jim Davis just one year after the release of THE GOODBYE GIRl?  In interviews Davis readily admits that he borrowed the name of his feline creation from Richard Dreyfuss's character, the pushy actor Elliot Garfield, and not only the name, but his whole persona of the know it all smart aleck.  Methinks the recent animated version of GARFIELD should have used Richard Dreyfuss's voice instead of Bill Murray's.  Never mind, Dreyfuss has been laughing all the way to the bank ever since he won the Oscar at age 30 for playing the part in one of show business' most incredible and unaccountable upsets.  In Hollywood circles it has long been whispered that on that long ago Oscarcast, presenter Faye Dunaway (the previous year's Oscar winner for best actress) was feeling her oats when she blearily opened the envelope and read the wrong name as the winner.  It is said that John Travolta, who might conceivably have won the Oscar instead of Dreyfuss, has refused to speak to Dunaway ever since.

THE GOODBYE GIRL, although sluggish in places and terribly overacted by Richard Dreyfuss (although, to give him credit, he was just doing what he was supposed to do), is far from the worst Neil Simon movie of the 1970s and indeed might be the best!  In fact the success of THE GOODBYE GIRL encouraged producers to keep hiring Neil Simon for another 10 years of imitations of this formula.  If GG hadn't succeeded we might have been spared some of the treacle that was to follow, including CHAPTER TWO (where Marsha Mason marries James Caan), SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES (with Goldie and Chevy) or ONLY WHEN I LAUGH (with Kristy McNichol playing the daughter of Marsha Mason).

Luckily in this picture the growing friendship between Marsha Mason and the 60s starlet Joan Hackett met with distaste by Mason's husband, and he divorced her ending their incredible partnership not too long afterwards.  They had a crazy streak of hits and flops together and will go down in history as the man who wrote the worst parts for an actress with a little bit of talent.  After that, for Neil Simon it was Matthew Broderick pictures and the Alec Baldwin-Kim Basinger disaster THE MARRYING MAN.  For Marsha Mason, well, there was the tragedy of Joan Hackett's untimely death, one Clint Eastwood movie in which most of her part was cut out, and a welcome return to the big screen last year in BRIDE AND PREJUDICE",1124755200,,2482,4.7733644859813085

1183131,5,B0000040H2,"In 1977, movie theater audiences were treated to what is probably Neil Simon's best writing with the film ""The Goodbye Girl"".  Directed by Herbert Ross (1927-2001, who later directed ""Steel Magnolias"" in 1989), the film stars Richard Dreyfuss as the aspiring actor Elliot Garfield, Marsha Mason as former dancer Paula McFadden and Quinn Cummings as Paula's 10-year old daughter Lucy.  The film begins with Paula and Lucy returning to their New York City apartment from a long day of shopping.  They are preparing to move to California with Paula's boyfriend, Tony Deforest (not shown), who is another aspiring actor that just got an acting job in a Hollywood film.  Upon getting home, Tony isn't there, but she finds a note that he left for her.  The note is not what Paula wanted or expected to hear: Tony left without her and Lucy.  Paula learns from building manager Mrs. Crosby (Theresa Merritt, 1924-1998) the next morning that loveable Tony did something else too: he sublet the apartment. Not having the money to move, Paula decides that she and Lucy will remain in the apartment.  When the subletee arrives (Elliot), she reluctantly agrees to share the apartment with him.  The resulting mutually antagonistic relationship slowly evolves into something quite different.
For his work in ""The Goodbye Girl"", Richard Dreyfuss won the much deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Marsha Mason was nominated for Best Actress and Quinn Cummings was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.  The film itself was nominated for Best Picture and Neil Simon was nominated for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.  Some of the very memorable scenes in the film include Paula & Lucy's arrival home at the beginning of the film, Elliot's arrival, the living arrangements, Elliot's rehearsals, Paula's exercises, Lucy's stomachache, Elliot's alternate employment, the Chianti, the rooftop dinner, the carriage ride and the closing scenes.  Other memorable characters include Elliot's off-Broadway director Mark (Paul Benedict, known for his portrayal of Harry Bentley in the 1975-1985 TV series ""The Jeffersons"") and Donna Douglas (Barbara Rhoades).
Overall, I rate the 1977 version of ""The Goodbye Girl"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's a wonderfully engaging film that continues to entertain to this day.  The 2004 television remake that starred Jeff Daniels as Elliot and Patricia Heaton as Paula was not anywhere as good as the original.",1074729600,,2444,5.219948849104859
1183132,5,B0000040H2,"With the current remake of Neil Simon's 'The Goodbye Girl' showing on television at the moment, it reminded me of this original film production, one of the better films from the 1970s, and one of the better films to derive from a Broadway play to keep much of the same character as the play.  This film won numerous awards:  Best Actor Oscar/Best Actor Golden Globe/Best Actor BAFTA for Richard Dreyfus; Best Picture Golden Globe; Best Actress Golden Globe/Best Actress Oscar Nomination for Marsha Mason; Best Supporting Actress Oscar Nomination for Quinn Cummings; Best Writing Oscar Nomination for Neil Simon, and the list goes on...
Neil Simon's play is dialogue driven rather than action-driven; this sometimes means the kiss of death for film, but in this production, it works beautifully.  Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason (married to Neil Simon at the time) make a lively, comfortably uncomfortable duo as the new-to-New-York actor Elliot Garfield and the down-on-her-luck 'Goodbye Girl' Paula McFadden.  Garfield shows up the night McFadden was dumped by her actor-boyfriend (not the first time this has happened, we soon discover); Garfield has been given the lease to the apartment that McFadden occupies with her daughter Lucy (admirably played by Quinn Cummings) -- much of the 'action' of the film takes place within the confines of this apartment (the primary set for the stage play) -- the relationship as Garfield and McFadden negotiate an unsettled truce which eventually becomes a friendship and then finally a love affair, with Lucy providing colour commentary all along the way.
Garfield is booked to play Richard III in the worst of all possible interpretations of the play; it closes in short order with atrocious reviews.  McFadden tries to resurrect her dancing career, realising that she has passed the realistic age for most Broadway productions (certainly at that time).  When Garfield gets the offer of a lifetime, he too plans to leave town, setting McFadden up for failure with a relationship once again, but at least she still has the apartment, right?
The dialogue is comedic and realistic at the same time -- the rapid-fire banter is classic Simon stage or screen; the impossible situations that cause characters to be constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown until small miracles creep in to keep life sane are also far more true to life than most people feel comfortable admitting.  Herbert Ross is to be commended with his direction here, in that he made the film a great film while retaining the crucial aspects of the great play.

Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason play mismatched people stuck rooming together when Mason's ex dumps her and sublets his apartment to Dreyfuss.  Mason's character has a young daughter, played by Quinn Cummings, and the three end up tolerating each other until resentment turns to acceptance turns to caring turns to love.  It's an old story but it's never been done better than this.
As an adult now, I think the film appeals to me because the male character is more than just window dressing in a story about how hard a woman's life is.  Guys don't want to be beat over the head and this movie doesn't do that.  Each character has their own chance to have a breakdown, and in the end we find a little of ourselves in all of them.",1030924800,,1001,4.264550264550264
1183138,4,B0000040H2,"Richard Dreyfuss won the Oscar for his performance in ""The Goodbye Girl,"" and Marsha Mason was married to the playwright, but I remember thinking that it young scene stealing Quinn Cummings who probably had more talent that the other two put together.  But then Cummings, after a nice turn on the classic TV domestic drama ""Family,"" has not been seen since ""Listen to Me,"" the 1988 film about college debaters starring Kirk Cameron and Jamie Gertz.  Meanwhile, it is Dreyfuss who has resurrected his career as an older curmudgeon.
In ""The Goodbye Girl"" Dreyfuss plays a young curmudgeon, Elliot Garfield, a struggling actor who has made the fateful mistake of sub-letting an apartment in the Big Apple from a friend.  The problem is that the friend split town leaving behind his girl friend, Paula McFadden (Mason) and her daughter Lucy (Cummings), who are not thrilled with the idea of being put out on the street.  After a series of initial diatribes (including the classic scene where each lays down the law for the other in turn), an uneasy alliance is agreed upon and we wait for the inevitable meeting of much more than the minds between the feuding couple.
The title of Neil Simon's play has to do with the fact that Paula always gets dumped in the end and the prospect of happiness does nothing to deter her absolute belief in the inevitability of her unhappiness.  An added treat in this film is Elliot's performance in Shakespeare's ""Richard III,"" which, as directed off-Broadway by Mark (Paul Benedict), insists the king was gay.  Really gay.  Incredibly, ... out of the closet and way over the rainbow gay.
Most Romantic Line:  ""What is it about you that makes a man with a hundred forty-seven I.Q. feel like a dribbling idiot?""  What did you expect?  This is a Neil Simon story so there are dozens of great one-liners, none of them especially romantic.

The banter between the two leads and their immediate dislike of each other turns softer as the movie goes on.  The character of Lucy (the daughter) is played to perfection.

Mason's wise-cracking daughter,(played by Quinn  Cummings) is fantastic as a cynical 10 year old and almost steals the movie  away from the main 2 characters.  When Dreyfuss agrees to let Mason and  her daughter share the apartment with him, the sparks start to fly.  Immediately Dreyfuss begins to assert his egocentric personality by laying  down the rules of the house ""I DON'T like the panties drying on the  rod !! ""  and their relationship goes down hill from there.  But  naturally, as it always goes in this type of romantic comedy, the 2 main  characters eventually begin to warm up to each other and have a  relationship of their own.  It's a movie about taking chances and allowing  yourself to be vulnerable just ONE more time to let love into your heart.  My friend, Debbie, and I have watched this movie so many times we can  practically recite the dialogue by heart ""mama bear done fixed the  cave up good !""  This movie is worth watching if just to see Dreyfuss'  character play the worst version of Richard III imaginable.  He sashays and  lisps and flounces around the off-Broadway stage until you are laughing so  hard your sides hurt !  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants  to watch something that is funny and yet touchingly innocent and uplifting,  all at the same time.",959299200,,1556,4.638376383763838
