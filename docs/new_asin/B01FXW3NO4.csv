7752191,5,B01FXW3NO4,Another great show from my childhood. Great memories...,1489536000,2,55,6.0
7752192,2,B01FXW3NO4,I guess this would be good if I understood Japanese but I don't.  There are no subtitles and there is no English audio track.  If there is I couldn't find it on the 3 DVD players I tried.  The only menu options are to select one of the 4 episodes.,1488672000,4,247,3.9
7752193,2,B01FXW3NO4,"Ok, so initially i gave this a one star review, but you know, I had to edit it coz in reality it's not a bad show, in fact it's a lot of fun.

The production however is pretty terrible, now  don't get me wrong, I understand people need to make money, I can respect the hustle and I have paid to watch plenty of third or fourth generation copies of various cult classics on VHS tapes over the years so was expecting it to be a triffling shonky, the disc itself appears to be a DVD-r, large comic sans letters emblazon the disc with 'the Space Giants', in fact, comic sans is used everywhere on the packaging so that kinda says a lot about the production quality of the packaging, comic sans and lo-res screenshots.

The sound is reaaaaally muffled in a lot of parts and the picture quality goes from z-grade to double z-grade, like, a lot of dithering on the image and I mean a lot.

When I first purchased this I was also really tempted by the second volume of shows in this series but will sadly pass as a future purchase clearly based on the quality of this one, they're just too bad. In saying that, I think if you just want to fire up a couple of bowls with some friends and have this playing in the background as you order pizza then fine, do it, get it, you'll dig it, just don't expect anything at all, go in with the lowest expectations and you may find this quite enjoyable, otherwise, well, just watch on YouTube.",1487289600,7,1423,4.239852398523985

7752195,3,B01FXW3NO4,"was hoping for an entre series release but happy with it ., this has 4 beginning episodes ..",1480204800,4,92,4.166666666666667
7752196,3,B01FXW3NO4,"The cover screams pirated copy. The slip inside screams pirated. The cheap DVD label screams pirated. The quality looks like a small youtube video blown up to fit modern TVs(which the opening disclaimer claims is a result of the way tv looked then. Uh, yea, no. I work in television). But I'm not saying it's pirated And ... it's The Space Giants. How else are you going to get it right now? I knew what I was getting so I'm satisfied. Just be aware of what you are getting.",1478649600,4,474,4.337078651685394
7752197,5,B01FXW3NO4,I watch this show went I was a kid bring memories is great to watch again I still in joy it if you love those monsters show like ultraman you won't be desapoint it,1473206400,4,163,3.823529411764706
7752198,5,B01FXW3NO4,"Don't get me wrong.  I love this series.  I even have it. But to say that Goldar is mightier than Ultraman is bunk!  Ultraman would kick Goldars shiny metallic butt and send him running to his mamma screaming that ""ultraman is picking on me again!""  Then Silvar  would divorce him for being wimpy, Gam would tell all his friends that he must have been adopted, and Methilala, the wise wizard would be on welfare for making a candy-assed robot.

 But all in all I say it's a great series!",1473033600,3,487,4.404494382022472
7752199,4,B01FXW3NO4,"This DVD was worth buying for me. I saw this show as a kid and of course it brings back good memories. Is the picture quality Great, of course not. How about the sound quality, Terrible. Special effects, About as lame as they get. I thought this might be the case before I purchased it so I wasn't surprised. It's probably no worse than when I saw it as a child. I'm sure a person could watch it online but I like having DVD's and Blu-rays of the shows I like and I've spend more money than this on a lot worse. It is only four episodes and there are no audio options. I did hear rumors the entire series might come to DVD and Blu-ray next year for the shows 50th anniversary. But until then this will do for me.",1466812800,11,712,4.056737588652482
