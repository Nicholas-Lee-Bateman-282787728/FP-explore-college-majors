8455028,4,B00536N82I,"It's a bit odd to see Hal Roach producing a picture absent of title cards and serial pratfalls and folks with lips flapping but no sound emanating. But Hal Roach did dally in talkies, some of which may be familiar to fans of witty farce (TOPPER, THE HOUSEKEEPER'S DAUGHTER) or prestigious adaptations (OF MICE AND MEN). One time he tried his hand at the historical swashbuckler, and that would be 1939's CAPTAIN FURY. And I say ""swashbuckler"" but, in truth, there's a strong flavor of the western to the thing. And a streak of rough-and-tumble comedy. John Ford would've been amused.

Brian Aherne's appearance and demeanor here owe a lot to cinema's leading swashbuckler, Errol Flynn. Shot in black and white, Aherne's Michael Fury actually resembles Flynn's Captain Blood more so than his Robin Hood. And lest we forget, in the 18th and 19th centuries, parts of Australia were established as penal colonies. The film opens with yet another convict ship settling into the Australian harbor, and out files the latest group of convicts.

Amongst these criminals is Michael Fury, and while we never do learn the exact nature of his offense, we're rapidly made aware of his mettle. Fury is assigned to hard labor to the ambitious local land baron Arnold Trist (George Zucco). A full-blooded Irishman, Fury has a gift for blarney and a distaste of injustice. Rebelling against the inhumane conditions practiced by the land baron, Fury escapes the prisoners' compound. Now a hunted fugitive - there's a standing 100 pound reward for the capture of escaped convicts - Michael Fury witnesses first hand Trist's campaign of terror against his struggling neighboring settlers, and this he cannot countenance. He rallies a few of his fellow convicts and takes the first steps to becoming a beloved folk hero. Never mind that, in the film, the Sydney Gazette doesn't depict him as such.

CAPTAIN FURY, hampered with a modest budget, nevertheless is a virile entertainer. I like the shift in venue as I don't recall there being a lot of high adventure pics that take place Down Under. The pace moves and there's plenty of action and a romantic moment or three. Predominantly, it's the actors who make it work. Hal Roach was able to coax spirited performances from the principals. It's a notable cast, bolstered by the burly Victor McLaglen, a dignified John Carradine, and lovely period ingnue June Lang. Others have already mentioned the presence of Roach's daughter, Margaret, who has a bit part as a settler's daughter, and of Charles Middleton who, once upon a time, played ""Ming the Merciless."" But while Carradine lends thoughtful elegance to his consumptive convict role, it's McLaglen as the likable, sticky-fingered thief, Blackie, who takes the cake - and if there were a cake he literally would have taken it. And Brian Aherne - whom I'll forever associate with that wonderful Twilight Zone episode, ""The Trouble with Templeton"" - admirably anchors things. He's strapping and dashing and honorable and everything a noble outlaw should be. Errol Flynn couldn't have done it better. It's a shame that CAPTAIN FURY is so forgotten. The actors deserve better. We fans of high adventure deserve better. And Australia deserves bett- - well, let's not go too far.

Lastly, no horses were harmed in the making of this film, especially not the horse that went over that waterfall. But the dummy prop on that horse was probably shattered to smithereens.",1362355200,,3442,4.980869565217391
8455029,2,B00536N82I,"`Captain Fury' is basically a spin on the Robin Hood tale.  It was directed by Hal Roach, who was famous for the `Our Gang' movies and had a more physically comical take on filmmaking, a style that played `against' the strengths of this film and helped to create a more dismissive vehicle.  At the end of the day, `Captain Fury' lacks the visceral punch it needed to be something intriguing.  Brian Aherne is bland here, which is a shame since he turned in an amazing (and Oscar nominated) performance that very same year in `Juarez'.  I expected far more from him.

Aherne plays Fury, an escaped convict who takes the law into his own hand when he discovers a tyrant abusing the rights of the settlers nearby.  He frees his fellow inmates and forms a gang that basically `robs from the rich' or `tyrant' and `gives to the poor' or `settlers'.  In the process he aggravates a powerful man and finds the love of a beautiful young woman who's father's moral compass doesn't allow him to allow her to entertain Fury's affections.  The action scenes are a little too `slapstick' for their own good.  Victor McLaglen is laughable, but intentionally, and June Lang and the director's daughter Margaret are stunning specimens and really nice to look at, but overall this film fails to ignite much in me at all.  It could have been so much more (the story, much like `Robin Hood', is a compelling one) but it just lays flat and doesn't spark much interest.",1340409600,,1448,4.62109375
8455030,2,B00536N82I,"""Captain Fury"" is a 1939 black and white adventure film about prison life in colonial 1840s  Australia. It was produced by Hal Roach and based on the 1882 novel ""Robbery Under Arms"" by Thomas Alexander Browne. The book was first adapted to the screen in 1907 and remade in 1911 and 1920.

British born Brian Aherne (1902-86) stars as an Irishman exiled to Australia and forced to work for a cruel land owner who is trying to take over an entire region. Aherne was nominated for an Oscar for ""Juarez"" (1939) but is probably best known for his role as King Arthur in ""Prince Valiant"" (1954) and again in ""Sword of Lancelot"" (1963). In this film he looks and sounds a lot like Errol Flynn, after whom the exploits of Captain Fury are copied.

The great Victor McLaglen (1886-1959) plays Ahern's right hand man. McLaglen won an Oscar for his performance in ""The Informer"" (1935), directed by John Ford. Ford and McLaglen worked together on 12 films, including Ford's cavalry trilogy and  my favorite McLageln films ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""(1948) and ""The Quiet Man"" (1952). His performance in this film is among his poorest.

John Carradine (1906-88) is another convict. He was a terrific character actor. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"", ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975).

Canadian born George Zucco (1886-1960) plays the land owner. Zucco made a living starring in B films or playing supporting roles in A films. He's probably best known for playing Professor Moriarty in ""Sherlock Holmes"" (1939), although in this film he is hardly as sinister.

Canadian born Douglass Dumbrille (1889-1974) plays Zucco's henchman. Dumbrille was in more than 200 films, and worked with the Marx Brothers (""Day at the Races"") as well as Abbott and Costello (""foreign Legion"") , the Bowery Boys (""Spook Busters""), the Ritz Brothers (""The 3 Musketeers""), and Bob Hope  (""Son of Paleface""), but he also did dramatic roles in films such as ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""Mr. Deeds Go to Town"", and ""Julius Caesar"" (1953).

Beautiful June Lang (1917-2005) plays Aherne's love interest. Lang was popular in the 30s and worked alongside Roach in Laurel and Hardy comedies. She's probably best known as Shirley Temple's mother from ""Wee Willie Winkle"" (1937) that also starred McLaglen.

Hungarian Paul Lucas (1891-1971) plays Lang's father. Lucas won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for his performance in ""Watch Over the Rhine"" (1943), a considerable feat considering  he was up against Bogart (""Casablanca"") and Gary Cooper (""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). He's probably best known as the Professor from Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"".

Producer/director Hal Roach (1892-1992) was a pioneer of comedy films in the silent era, known for his work with Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang, etc. He moved from comedy shorts to full length features (""Topper"", ""Of Mice and Men""), then transitioned to a successful career in TV (""The Stu Erwin Show"", ""My Little Margie"").

The film has some nice footage of Australian animals, and gives us a picture of life in colonial Australia, but otherwise this is a poor version of ""Robin Hood"". The action is stunted and some of the fight sequences are more comical than aggressive (possibly as a result of Roach's style).

Bottom line - A poor effort despite the good cast and the interesting setting.",1330128000,,3559,4.989864864864865
