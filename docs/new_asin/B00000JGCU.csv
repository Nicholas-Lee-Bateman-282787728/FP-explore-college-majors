Depression can really get a stranglehold on its sufferers, and the subjects of this America Undercover segment do a remarkable job of articulating its physical and emotional effects.

If you don't suffer from the Big D, please don't be dismissive of it or those who do.  You know not of what you speak.  Those who do (myself included) fear and respect its power.  I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

Author William Styron (featured in this video) phrased it very well when he said that the term ""depression"" is quite misleading:  You're not depressed -- you're insane!  He's right.  You're out of your head in the worst way.  He goes on to say that many Depression sufferers who kill themselves aren't doing so because they hate themselves, but rather because they love themselves -- it is a mercy killing, the only sure way to stop the pain.

There are several compelling books on the subject as well.  Among others, I recommend Elizabeth Wurtzel's ""Prozac Nation:  Young and Depressed in America"".",1266969600,,1155,4.598039215686274
