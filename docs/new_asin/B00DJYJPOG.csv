5820005,5,B00DJYJPOG,It was a heart warming story about family love loss and renewal it was nice of them to take that poor orphaned girl in and make her a part of their family.,1396396800,,155,3.875
5820006,5,B00DJYJPOG,Usually sequels are poor but this one comes very close to the first in the series.  Would recommend to all families.  Despite the cgi the story is very good and the animation better than the 4th one.  The music was superb in this one. Family found it entertaining and have watched it several times now.,1394582400,2,302,4.454545454545454

5820008,4,B00DJYJPOG,We enjoyed this princes classic with a family twist. It was rented for an 8 yr old who really liked it. The story was good and similar to other Swan Princess films where Odette is the main starlette. Nice moral lesson. Good lesson about the meaning of family.,1394150400,2,259,4.416666666666667
5820009,4,B00DJYJPOG,"Honestly I thought this would end up being horrible, but surprisingly the story was pretty good. I am not a fan on the new 3D style though and I didn't like one of the songs.  If this was in 2D style I would have liked it more, but overall I enjoyed it..",1394150400,5,254,3.8846153846153846
5820010,5,B00DJYJPOG,"After Swan Princess Christmas I wasn't sure of the idea of another CGI  Swan Princess.  Once I started the movie I'm glad I bought it. Is as great as the original trilogy and a find addition to the Swan Prince legacy. The Dark Arts that been behind Odette's problems since the original film is back. Only this time instead of evil humans, the Dark Arts is attacking with an army of flying squirals who was tricked into believing The Swan Princess is evil.  When the Dark Arts itself kills a wood cutter Prince Derek and Princess Odette adopts his daughter who is kidnapped and must be rescued by a daring plan.",1393286400,2,610,4.4774774774774775

ALYCES THOUGHTS (7 YEARS OLD):

I was really excited when The Swan Princess came.  I came home from school and mama showed me it.  I opened it and I wanted to watch the movie but first I had to go to dance class.  I came home from dance to watch the movie and I LOVED it because it was fun but one part wasn't so fun.  When the bad man wanted to kill Princess Odette.  It wasn't scary though.  Just part of the movie.

The Swan Princess made me feel happy because Princess Odette took Alise to her house after Alises house burned down because of the bad man, and her dad died.  But she went to live with Princess Odette in the castle and that made me happy.

I think little girls would like this movie because its a good movie to watch because its about princesses.  I think almost every age could watch and like it.  My 4 year old brother even likes it.

Thank you for sending me the movie because I really liked it and I want to watch it lots more times.",1392854400,6,1062,4.019138755980861
5820012,1,B00DJYJPOG,"So, they made another..... and this is what they came up with.

Just no.

Please no, make it stop. I beg you.",1391126400,10,109,3.909090909090909

5820070,4,B00DJYJPOG,this movie tugged at my heart BIG time  i freaking LOVED IT. it was about time Odette and Derek had child. Alise is so adorable and beautiful; she made me shed a tear every time she was onscreen. i didn't mind the CG the story was dark and emotional. Skully was a great supporter and the Evil Force was really creepy despite not being a physical being like the past villains. anyway if there's a next time i hope Alise will have a bigger speaking role but for now I welcome Alise to this wonderful loving family,1426723200,,511,4.268041237113402

The story is fine, nothing radical. The songs are generic at beast. It's no Pixar or Dreamworks (or even second rate dream works)",1412380800,,402,4.302631578947368

Swan Princess (number 5): A Royal Family Tale. Watched it out of curiosity because I remembered the first three films. I will examine Plot, Character and Polish and then assign a grade.

 PLOT

This is the most original/different of the Swan Princess sequels in terms of plot. There are no expies/former partners of Rothbart to serve as villains or holiday themes. Granted, the idea of a Chosen One prophecy is not original but I'm not thinking about that kind of scale but the scale of the series (you can see what I think about absolute originality at my blog). Also, Odette doesn't get kidnapped! Does that count as a spoiler? It's a point in this story's favor of altering the recipe established by the first three films.

The third point of difference is the sense of time. Every film following the first treated Derek and Odette as in the early stages of their marriage. The fourth film was about their first Christmas as a couple. This is the first one to go beyond that and give a sense of them being married for some time. Also, adopting a child certainly changes the dynamics. Again granted, Alise fills the Damsel In Distress role filled by Odette previously but having Odette being part of the rescue party is still a point of change; the fourth point of change. Another little spoiler alert: no changing into a swan this time (number 5!)

A sixth point is that there's a different sort of ending than the first three and the stock footage from the end of the first does not make an appearance here. That's a favorable thing about the switch to CGI right?

Enough about the differences. This plot itself is one that I like.

The plot of ""chosen one bringing about a golden age"" is classic medieval fantasy. Furthermore, that there is a band of rescuers with diverse skills (a hunter, a flyer, a chemist, etc.) further calls to mind the classic quest narrative.

Alise is not dropped in for the cute factor; she is well integrated into the story. The movie begins with Uberta saying I Want Grandkids and the main couple discussing it afterward. Alise' father is killed incidentally by the Forbidden Arts and Odette feels a kinship with her because of this. Alise herself does something to defeat the Big Bad.

 CHARACTERS

Alise is adorable. She is a cute little Woobie taken into the loving care of Odette and Derek. That the animators were able to convey so much emotion from her without having her say a word for 99% of the film is a credit to them. Her relationships with others are cute and sweet but not saccharine (YMMV of course).

Odette's more active role is much appreciated. In my opinion, she was always on the verge of it but plot hang ups interrupted it. It's not an Action Girl thing but a Plucky Girl thing mixed with All Loving Heroine. It's also a Mama Bear thing; in the words of Scully, ""there's no strength like a mother's love"".

Derek is not an idiot for once. The movie's plot is not underpinned by some Idiot Ball like in previous movies (""What else is there?"" to ""I'll destroy the notes after the festival"" and others). More perceptive with people and traps and doesn't go off alone anymore. Like with Odette, this character development is welcome in my book.

Scully the Scullion (i.e. Flying Squirrel) is my favorite character in this movie. It is how his voice sounds both wise and comical. It is in his skill with potions.  It is the jokes he makes without reducing himself to mere comic relief.

 The villains are also a refreshing change of pace. Instead of an evil sorcerer and their single minion, a two person operation, there is instead something like a militant cult. Furthermore, the vast majority of them are well-intentioned extremists, which is also a first for this series.

 POLISH

 The CGI looks good in my opinion and main characters like Odette avert the No Flow in CGI thing regarding hair. I haven't seen the fourth film so I can't speak about its quality but the CGI here is good. After watching the first three films it can take some getting used to, that's all.
