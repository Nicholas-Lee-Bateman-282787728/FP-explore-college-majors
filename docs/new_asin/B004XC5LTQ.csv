8446627,5,B004XC5LTQ,"Hidamari Sketch (now heading for a 4th season in 2012) is based off a 4-panel (""yon-koma"" in Japanese) comic strip style manga-- you can find it translated to English as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine-Sketch-Vol-1/dp/0759528993/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine Sketch, Vol. 1</a>. Because it's based off what is basically a comic strip rather than a more comic book-like manga, the story isn't going to be as compelling as the characters and how they interact-- other shows based on ""yon-koma"" like Lucky Star and K-On! bear this out.

The structure of the ""yon-koma"" is designed to quickly set up a punch line in the 4th panel, so naturally the gags are fast-paced, and the characters are very quirky. In fact, without these the manga (let alone the anime) would fall very flat, and probably wouldn't make it past the initial pitch. By season 3, however, the writers have added enough story structure to the episodes to achieve the right pace and still retain the same comic timing.

Not only are 2 new characters (Nori and Nazuna) introduced, we get to see more of the supporting characters like Yoshinoya-sensei and Natsume.

As with many Sentai Filmworks releases, this is a subtitle-only release, so that might be a negative for fans of dubs. Personally, I like my anime in its original spoken language, so this was a great deal for me.

Ume-sensei's knack for witty humor along with SHAFT's visual talents combine for another 14 episodes of pure, cute awesomeness. I highly recommend this.",1327622400,,1551,5.318367346938776
8446628,4,B004XC5LTQ,"If you've watched the first seasons (Hidamari Sketch and Hidamari Sketch x 365) already you should know what the series is all about... but if you're reading this review and you haven't yet I suggest you watch the past two seasons if you are interested in slice of life and watching this series.

But yeah as usual, this series is about 4 girls who live in an apartment and attend art school (which happens to be right across from the apartments!). However as you can tell from the cover of the DVD there are two new main characters that are added to the roster! Their names are Nori (the blue haired girl) who's likes computers and is pretty level-headed compared to the rest of the characters and Nazuna (the girl with the white/sandy blonde hair) who is very shy and not in the art department.

The series deals with the daily lives of these 6 girls focusing on them doing relatively 'normal' things such as going to school, hanging out together, and doing things at home. There is a bunch of humor throughout the whole series, but for the most part the show is a relaxing, 'feel-good' series with a lot of character interaction.

If you are not a fan of anime where 'nothing happens' or if you prefer shows with a lot of plot/action, then this series is not for you.

Anyway, this is overall my favorite season of Hidamari Sketch. I really enjoy the newer characters and the dynamic they bring to the already solid group of the original 4 characters. The episodes are consistently good and funny, and if you're a fan of the minor characters like Yoshinoya, Chika or Natsume you'll definitely still get a few episodes of them and their great antics.

Of course, Yuno is still the 'main' character and gets the most screentime, but one of the things I like about Hidamari Sketch is that despite the main characters getting most of the screentime, every character eventually gets a good amount of screentime.

The only big flaw I have with this series is that we didn't see enough of the newer characters, but I'm hoping that a future season of Hidamari Sketch will feature more of them.

Overall, if you liked the first two seasons I would most definitely recommend buying this series. As I said earlier, if you have not seen the first two seasons and are a big fan of slice of life/'feel-good'/""nothing happens"" shows, then I recommend you check out the first two seasons before watching this.",1309132800,5,2396,4.597189695550352
