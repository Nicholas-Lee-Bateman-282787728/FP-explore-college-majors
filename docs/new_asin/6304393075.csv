865255,5,6304393075,"Shakespeare explained by Al Pacino--and, you guys, listen up! Just to watch the cast--not to mention the street people--work through the issues of Shakespeare\Art\Acting\Reality is worth the price. Pacino's take on the  piece as the doings of a Royal British Mafia helps a viewer in relating to  the complicated context of the Wars of Roses.",941760000,,341,5.181818181818182
865256,5,6304393075,"Shakespeare did not write for the elite. That the elite enjoyed it was wonderful, but he understood that the money was in the masses. Today, it is assumed that because of the difference in language and because it is  written in verse, Shakespeare is only understandable by the intellectual  among us. Pacino sets out to prove that theory wrong.
By going to the  common man and asking what they know of Shakespeare, by talking to other  Shakepearean actors, and by showing us the trials of putting on the play,  we learn so much more about the play, it's subject, and the acting process.
Putting on this play, or any play written so long ago, is more than just  reading lines. Why did Richard do what he did? What politcal forces was he  dealing with? What personal demons plagued him?
Place those discussions  within the practical ones of where do we shoot this scene, why did we pick  this tower, and what time of day should it be?
This was such a wonderful  film, and the presentation of the play and the behind the scenes  negotiations that I actaully went to the video store asking when Pacino's  Richard III would be released. Imagine my dissapointment to find that the  documentary was the point of the film. I LOVED this! but I still hope  Pacino will go ahead and film the play!
Even without a full blown film,  this play was wonderful. I watch it over and over and find something new  each time.",932256000,,1404,4.511904761904762
865257,5,6304393075,"The most useful film yet for drama students at all levels. Pacino demonstrates why so many English teachers are wrong when they teach Shakspeare as if it were intended to be read. He takes the audiance through the complex, time consuming and open-ended process whereby a complicated script is slowly researched, work-shoped and ultimately performed.
His ultimate characterization of Richard III is far more real than Oliver's, far more evil than Guilgud's and does not resort to the trick of making Richard in to a Nazi, as does McKellan.
His portrayal reveals the Shakespearian truth - genuine evil is both seductive and distructive, and certainly most powerful. He provides us a clue to understanding Hitler, Amin, Pol Pot, etc.

865388,5,6304393075,"I always remembered watching this film when I was in high school when we were reading Hamlet. The purpose around this film was for us to gain context of the Shakespeare, to normalize it, and help us understand the context in the present day. Frankly, I found all of the actors interpretations of Richard III  to be engrossing and downright funny. They seek to understand the characters in the circumstances and break this very complicated play down into constructive synthesis.

Pacino himself makes an amazing Richard with the Penelope Allen and Kevin Spacey  assisting with incredible supporting roles and multiple American actors playing roles that you always thought were intended for British actors. This film proved that American actors can partake in play Shakespearean characters.

 It is funny because of Pacinos comedic talent but also deadly serious. I truly appreciated and became excited due to the passion that these actors have for Shakespeare and that is owed to Pacino's vision along with that of his colleagues. I wholeheartedly recommend this film which I am happy to say has been read discovered.",1473552000,,1116,5.143646408839779

Al Pacino and his crew delves into both the characters in the play, and what relevance it has to today's world. One of the most fun parts of this is Al Pacino himself, playing Richard III and trying to find and show the world meaning behind the bard's words. I certainly never expected Pacino to embrace and be passionate about Shakespeare, but he throws himself into it like everything else he has done, and lends his personality to it.

865539,2,6304393075,"There are worse things than making a documentary about Shakespeare's ""Richard III"" that might be of interest to students or people with no previous experience with the play. Unfortunately, Al Pacino is not the person to do it. His 1979 Broadway performance of the part was critically reviled and his depiction of the role in this film indicates that while he was superb as Michael Corleone and Jack Kevorkian and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, Shakespeare's hunchbacked Earl of Gloucester is a part thoroughly out of his range. As a director, he has only a superficial insight into the play and despite surrounding himself with experienced Shakespearean actors (including Kevin Spacey as Buckingham, who would gone on to become a memorable Richard III onstage), the film will only be of interest as a beginner's primer to the play.

If you have no previous experience with Shakespeare or ""Richard III"" and want to familiarize yourself with it for a class or for your own personal growth, I'd advise you to watch Ian McKellen's 1995 film which brilliantly set the play in a 1930s fascist state reminiscent of Nazi Germany. But anyone who's looking for an indication of the power of Al Pacino's acting, do yourself a favor and rent ""Dog Day Afternoon"" instead.",1423958400,3,1259,4.966824644549763

865589,5,6304393075,"The documentary follows the process of staging a play. One of my favorite aspects of the *many* facets to this documentary was the production staff getting frustrated because Pacino gets more and more into the documentary process itself, pushing it harder and further than planned with each milestone achieved. It's hilarious, moving and fascinating. So many layers to this documentary - a complex play, complex accomplished actors and a complex process; staging a play while creating a film about staging a play that is really about L-I-F-E. The many, many layers are so artfully woven in this piece.
The acting is wonderful. The documentary conversation is wonderful. Pacino is beautiful; he's both brilliant and humble. I enjoyed  how the documentary format allows the viewer to see how Pacino can be a complete goof, loafing around with friends while walking down the street but then he'll pull in, impromptu, go into character, and hugely fill the space - I think they call it Presence.",1414800000,2,991,5.079754601226994

865592,5,6304393075,"Richard must be a man speaking his inner world. Richard is not exactly a new kid on the block, being almost 500 years old. Yet the stunning discovery of the king's skeleton in a Leicester car park sky-rockets him into the modern conscientiousness  as though he'd been reborn.

Al Pacino's Looking for Richard III takes on a new significance even though the film is now almost fifty years old. It was an old saw that Americans cannot play Shakespeare. Often Americans in particular could not get past Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Richard III. Pacino attempts to take both the doubters and Richard himself in hand. He approaches Richard viscerally, but not a blow below the belt but a blow at the belt.

Is Al Pacino trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses? You bet. He is peddling Shakespeare. This film bounces around with interviews with famous actors such as John Gielgud and Vanessa Redgrave and James Earl Jones and scenes of London like the Globe theater, with conversations with just anybody Al passes as he somewhat frenetically gets you thinking about Richard.

Pacino's costume when he is on camera as Richard III consists of a sort of gown, black in color with large fleur de lis on the sleeves. The sleeves must be reminding  people of the stunning victory at Agincourt some years before. Pacino's face actually works for Richard, the eyes shifty, the jaws covered with stubble, the hair jet black and lanky. Since Shakespeare gave Richard a hunchback, a withered arm and a gimpy leg, Pacino nevertheless hobbles around rapidly,l his Richard-mind working fast at planning  his latest coup such as murdering the Princes in the Tower.

As the film opens Richard has to recite the Now is the winter of our discontent soliloquy. Pacino performs well- very well-and it is easy to imagine him as Richard, with his swarthy, mobile face and shifty eyes. At the end of the play cameras move out into the field as Richard, totally alone, his horse gone (and you see the horse galloping away as fast as he can) and of course the King has to cry A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse! This is heady stuff that makes you sympathize just a bit with the villain Richard III.

Pacino has his finger in many pies as he communicates how he  feel about Shakespeare. His enthusiasm is catching and although you may not have given Richard III a thought before you saw this pungent brew of a documentary, you will now.",1404518400,,2414,4.6745283018867925

I also am one of those people who doesn't think of Richard the Third as a purely evil and loathsome monster, the way he is portrayed by Shakespeare. After viewing ""Looking for Richard"" I found out that it was a documentary that led nowhere.  There was never any filmed version of this play with Mr. Pacino and all the footage of the play being acted out was only for this film.  And, I was not impressed by their ""expert"" historian, who knew less about the real Richard and his wife and family than I do.  I had to explain several things to my husband after I asserted that the historian was wrong.  I would recommend this to:  1. Fans of Al Pacino.  2. Fans of Shakespeare or 3.

865595,5,6304393075,"Watching the documentary, Looking for Richard, heightened my respect for actors and directors.  Having only ever been a spectator for my 60+ years, I never realized the amount of behind the scenes work that goes on.  I have loved the challenges of Shakespeare ever since I watched Kenneth Branaugh's, Henry V.  I have since watched many productions, but never realized how the Bard's words could be interpreted not in only one way, but many ways.  I loved the documentary and look forward to watching Kevin Spacey's, Now.",1399420800,,521,4.954022988505747
865596,5,6304393075,"Al Pacino analyzes and dives into one of the greatest play of the history of theater. He wonders how come so few people understand this play, which at first glance seems so complicated and yet so simple. A play full of colorful characters, but in short a story of a man thirsty for power, willing to do anything to obtain it. The truth shown here is, that we do not see evil even when it is right in front of us. The great message of Richard III. is not his evil and how corrupted by power he is. But the naivet, inactivity or direct collaboration of those around him. What made Richard so terrible is not what he wanted to do, but Buckingham who helped him, Hastings who did not stop him and all the others just sitting around and hoping that the bloody axe will avoid them. Al Pacino's combination of actors on and off stage beautifully shows how rather normal people can become corrupted by power, fear and greed. Today, when we face again another ruthless tyrant trying to usurp power and rule over everybody else, turning one of the greatest countries again into the Evil Empire, this message is even more important.  Al Pacino's performance is incredible, I would love to see him play the whole piece on stage.",1396828800,,1216,4.4774774774774775
865597,5,6304393075,"Not only is this a very funny and entertaining film, it is also a completely honest and successful version of Richard III with American actors acting as Americans and not faux-Brits.  Pacino is at the top of his game as Richard and gives us a very spooky character you would not want your daughter, or your sons, or your mother, brothers, cousins, none of them, to get too close to.  All the supporting characters, perhaps especially the female actors, are equally enjoyable.  The movie is joyful and serious at the same time.  At times you laugh loudly at the gags, at times you just sit back and marvel at the quality of the acting.  This is Shakespeare without the high-brow British snobbery, but also without the elaborate emotive face making and body movement that often destroy American acting.  I recommend it with no reservations at all.",1396828800,,845,4.7534246575342465

Often there are arguments between Pacino and his group about whose interpretation and/or understanding is ""right."" All of that was interesting but Pacino & Co. also actually film the play. Not all of it, but key scenes which, ultimately, I found annoying as they cut between those and the interviews, etc. I would have preferred to have watched all the analyses and THEN seen the entire play.

865681,5,6304393075,"An elegant yet earthy breakdown of both Shakespeare's greatest villain and the play in which he stars, Al Pacino's ""Looking For Richard"" has been a favorite of mine ever since I was a 13 year old kid just experiencing Shakespeare for the first time.  The main part of this documentary concerns Pacino and his troupe of actors breaking down and analyzing the text of Richard III, which, okay, sounds boring on paper if you're not into the nuts and bolts of scene analysis (being quite a nerd, I enjoyed it), but this film also covers much more than that. Pacino covers the question of Shakespeare's lasting appeal, the reluctance of many American performers to tackle his plays, the ins-and-outs of Shakespearean language, the more complex aspects of being a stage actor (including the aforementioned scene breakdown and analysis), just to name a few things. What Pacino really accomplishes is that he gives his film the same vibrancy and contentiousness that has kept Shakespeare's works fresh over five centuries. During the table read, the actors are not debating politely over their characters; they get heated, engaged, opinionated. Even the man-on-the-street interviews have a certain fire to them, particularly one older man who talks passionately about the power of language and how the language we use affects our treatment of other people. Heady stuff, but never boring. Peppered within all of this are fully mounted scenes from a handsome film production that could have (and I wish would have) been, with Pacino as Richard, Kevin Spacey as Buckingham, Alec Baldwin as Clarence, and so on.

Rather than simply being the droning, bloodless insider look at actors endlessly debating a 400 year old text it could have been, ""Looking For Richard"" is a lively, smart, surprisingly funny examination of Shakespeare's work.

865831,4,6304393075,"I discovered Al Pacino's Looking For Richard while taking a survey course on the works of Shakespeare. I'd already read Richard III and watched a version of it; however, it wasn't until I saw Looking For Richard that I gained a true appreciation for the play. Although I didn't learn much I didn't already know when it came to the work itself, seeing how seasoned actors approached it offered a new depth and angle to each character that I hadn't encountered in my cold reading or other watch-through. Howard Shore brought a thrilling score to the project that highlighted the grandeur of the period. Looking For Richard is an excellent combination of documentary and filmed play, as funny and entertaining as it is sobering. It brings to light the majesty of Shakespeare--not just in Richard III, but in all of his work. I recommend this to anyone who is considering a study of the Bard's plays . . . or simply wants to get a sense of why he's the greatest playwright of all time.",1348617600,,981,4.611428571428571

I say this previous reference because Al Pacino - this nature force - one of the top actors all over the world undertook the absorbing task to prepare - through a very well thought script -in which intervene the narrative thread as well the rehearsals, academic opinions, public points of view and perosnal contribution in order to decipher the enigma, the thirst of power, ambition and nefast kingdom of probably one of the most lascive and sinister personages the Shakesperian literature reminds.

Richard has a goal: to be king. And the fact thirteen pepople are ahead from him in the successoral line frankly doesn't matter at all. They are simple obstacles on the road and no one will deviate his attention. So, the fervent interest for knowing these unrevealed labyrinths plenty of cold blooded wheelings and dealings are dealt with recent contrasts with the actual behavior of many rulers.

There are crucial sequences like the way of Richard begs for mercy to Anna with that nasty hyena aspect or the macabre attitude of ordering the final death sentence of Clarence or his own nephews, rescinding pacts or any sort of scruples.

Pacino had a marvelous touch of genius interviewing actors of the artistic flight like John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave or Derek Jacobi in order to add more clues around the major understanding of Richard.

865922,5,6304393075,"This is brillant. Wheather you like Shakespere, Al Pacino, theatre, film, or acting, Looking For Richard is so fun on so many levels, you have to be numb not to enjoy it.

Even the easiest Shakespere is hard to understand: simply, there is a language barrier. This may be English, but it is 500 year old English in both poetic and dramatic form. Pile on this complex motivations and historical referances Shakespere took for granted his audiance knowing, and yes, I would pick up my Playboy after a few pages too.

Lucky for us, we have none other than Al Pacino to walk us through Richard III, problably one of Billy's most complicated plays. To help, he gets Sir John Geilgood, Kevin Klien, Kevin Spacey, Wanona Rider, Venessa Redgrave, Estelle Parsons (Roseanne's crazy mom) and other, lesser known  actors and accidemics to walk us through this play. How? Basically, by walking themselves through it.

They reherse the play, talk about it, fight about it, and talk about it some more. They scout locations, they discuss it in New York City cafes, with passers by on the sidewalk. They work it out on the street, sometimes using trash cans as props. They work in costumes, they work in t-shirts and sunglasses. They talk about the history, the motivations of the characters, and about the politics of it.

All this is done as they are hanging out, playing with the words and emotions, the way actors do. Pacino adds voice overs, explaining the parts of the play in convorsational languge, as if you are having a cup of coffee with him. This is no high-brow excursion; this is making Shakespere accessable to anyone willing to watch.

As if this is not enough, you also get to see some of our best actors as people, working, relaxing, and thinking. You see them as people. Pacino reminds me more of my easy-going jazz bass teacher than the driven cops and hoods he usually plays.

Also great is the insight you gain into how actors work. Since there are many actors in this film, there are many opinions on this material. Pacino may have taken the initative here, but he really lets things roll. You get to see how scenes (from Richard III) are dicected, experimented on, and the fun these guys are having.

If you want to have some fun too, check Looking For Richard out.",1247184000,,2274,4.6393034825870645
865923,5,6304393075,"Looking For Richard is based on one of Shakespeare's most popular plays, Richard III.  It is a kind of documentary which attempts to show some of the scenes of the play and explain the text and context.  The aim of the documentary is to impart a love of Shakespeare, increase the public's access to Shakespeare and to disprove the longheld theory that American's can't act well in Shakespeare's plays.  I'm not convinced the documentary did manage to disprove the theory that Americans can't 'do' Shakespeare.  The scenes are acted by modern, well-known actors including Kevin Spacey, Aidan Quinn and Alec Baldwin.  Some of the acting and discussions were completely over the top, with excessive anger being a common behaviour in the discussions.  Winona Ryder as Richard III's wife Anne, is the worst of all the Americans, but Al Pacino who directed, wrote, produced, narrated and stared in the DVD is surprisingly good, in a traditionalist way.  He truly does seem to be enamoured of the brilliant play.  The costumes are good, as is the searching for modern day places to film the scenes.  However his visit to the re-created Globe Theatre in England is a bit over the top.
I think this is a brilliantly clever introduction to Richard III.  If you enjoyed it, you might like to try the version of the play staring Ian McKellen (Gandalf in Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings and Magneto in the recent XMEN movies).  Having many DVD's in which there are token American's playing some of the roles, I'm still not convinced that American's can 'do' Shakespeare, but it was a good attempt and a good documentary.  I will watch it often and share it with my friends who are just starting to expose themselves to Shakespeare's plays",1235952000,,1727,4.797297297297297
865924,5,6304393075,"I've always caught this movie on cable whenever I could, as it's a great treatment of the art of acting and the play itself.  Pacino takes us on a journey not only through the play, but also through Manhattan as he drums up interest in seeing the play at a Shakespearian Festival.  Here we hear from erudite panhandlers as well as learned experts on Shakespear and famous Shakespearian actors.  We also see him going through the city looking for locations to film his version of the play, settling on The Cloisters, the museum, and having to shoo away curious pedestrians while he rehearses a scene.  He shows readings with luminaries like F. Murray Abraham; Kevin Spacey and a host of familiar faces from the stage and screen.  We get to hear them argue about what the characters are feeling; how they should react and other behind-the-scenes stuff we don't have the privaledge of seeing otherwise.  There are parties with guests talking about their experiences with Shakespear and street filming broken up by the police.  The actual play is abridged and told mainly in soliloquies by Al between and even during scenes.  He speaks to acting students, cab drivers, and practically anyone else who'd give him the time of day.
As an amature actor/director who's been in community theater for a few years, this film offers much in the way of style and thought behind the style.  The actual scenes are studies in minimalism and having the actors carry the play on their backs, just as Shakespear intended.  Even Ol' Willy shows up here and there for comic relief.
Even if you're not into acting or Shakespear in particular, this film will open your eyes to the craft and art behind the words.  A true masterpiece of film making.",1228003200,,1724,4.751677852348993
865925,4,6304393075,"I really enjoyed this film because it makes accessible one of the greatest written English stories to another generation on whom otherwise it would be lost. The Bard's play is a story written after the fact during the victorious Tudor era.  Hence the creation of a dark hearted villain and his manipulative lust for power. Richard really was a brave king who died in battle at the head of his troops at Bosworth in 1485, the victorious Henry Tudor's family thus  having the opportunity to enjoy Shakespeares re-write of history as they clung to power.
 The villain is a true monster and has been the basis of many a similar character that Pacino himself has played in a more modern setting.

I studied the play at school and at first was baffled by the language.  I persevered with it, and suddenly the sheer brilliance of it became apparent. I've loved it ever since and have seen it performed in Statford, seen all the movies etc etc. Pacino get's together a powerful bunch of actors who illuminate the characters. Alec Baldwin's Duke of Clarence, Kevin Spacey's Hastings all get to the nub of what Shakespeare intended.

865926,4,6304393075,"Al Pacino's directing debut is a (sort of) documentary of him as he prepares to film Shakespeare's Richard III (with him on the title role, of course). We see him researching the material, going to Shakespeare's house in England, rehearsing with the actors, interviewing people on the street about Shakespeare, interviewing scholars. As the film progresses, we actually see him performing (parts) of the play with the actors (including Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder, among others). Its enjoyable and informative, though it is sometimes irritating when Pacino asks questions to the scholars he already knows the answer to. It's a bit self-indulgent, also, though Pacino does come as a likable person. But his unpretentiousness seems a little too studied, a little too forced (hey, Shakespeare is for normal people too, he seems to say, a little too many times).",1200182400,,860,5.194244604316546

If you like the Bard, or his plays, or theater in general, or documentary films about the arts, this one's for you. I saw it on the Independent Film Channel via Dish Network, because the DVD apparently is not currently available in the USA, although it can be purchased in Europe. Whoever owns the rights to this 1996 film ought to get the DVD into the stores and on-line distributors in 2008. It may be a British play, with several British/Irish actors in it, but essentially, this is an American product made by American masters: Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, Estelle Parsons, Penelope Miller and others are in the play portions, and James Earl Jones, Kevin Kline and several others do some commentary.

865928,4,6304393075,"First off lets be clear, this is a documentary about Al Pacino making a version of Richard III. As someone who has very minimal knowledge of Shakespeare I found this to be very interesting and it made me want to watch a complete film or see it performed at a theatre.

Contrary to some previous reviewers I'd say that Pacino showed great respect to the material and to the more famous British actors who have been involved in versions of this story down the years. He interviews Sir John Guilgud and Kenneth Brannagh to try and understand what the lines he is saying really mean. I have no doubt that if Sir Lawrence Olivier had still been alive Pacino would have wanted to interview him about his famous performance.

Pacino proves himself to be an engaging and intelligent presenter, and his Richard III, whilst undoubtably heavily influenced by Oliver is a striking performance. If like me you have never studied Shakespeare, and have little understanding of what is now frankly almost a foreign language then this film gives you the opportunity to be educated and entertained at the same time.",1193529600,,1097,4.768421052631579
866030,3,6304393075,"It is hard not to be impressed by the sincere effort that old ham Al Pacino makes in this movie to explore the rich meanings of one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, and to figure out how to make it relevant to a modern American audience. At times it has something of a ""Shakespeare for Morons"" quality, but in fairness there are a lot of nuances to explain. There is a nice explication of what the hell ""iambic pentameter"" actually is, for instance, though Pacino himself clearly doesn't grasp it & just shrugs uncomprehendingly and turns away, hilariously.

The movie also features great interview snippets with accomplished Shakespearean actors--frankly I would have liked hearing a lot more about what the Bard's works mean to James Earl Jones, Kenneth Branagh, and Sir John Gielgud, and less of Pacino's ruminations and middling (though predictably loud and spittly) interpretation of the lead role. And, someone please tell him that a man with jowls should not be wearing a backwards baseball hat (as he frequently does in the rehearsal scenes.)

Kevin Spacey acquits himself particularly well in the generally very solid supporting cast, though poor Winona Ryder and Aidan Quinn are badly overmatched. Paul Guilfoyle has a great bit as one of the unexpectedly ambivalent murderers sent to do away with Richard's brother Clarence, played by a stubbly Alec Baldwin (Do it! DO IT!) A creepy/hilarious behind the scenes moment: Pacino unironically fighting for the casting of as young an actress as possible as his love interest--they ended up with Winona, and an unconvincing but at least memorably twisted seduction scene. I also liked the cutting back and forth between rehearsals and full-costume performance, though other films have done it with better effect--but few with more gusto.",1188864000,5,1792,5.133561643835616
866031,4,6304393075,"Some reviewers have complained about this film. This is a documentary that illustrates how Shakespeare can be seen as both art and history, both as literature and as entertainment. One reviewer called it an introductory for grade school children. That's exactly the point. ""looking for Richard"" is an introductory to the complexities and richn ess of Shakespeare and those who act and perform his plays. Certainly the general audience at ""The Rose"" and ""The Globe"" were not scholars, teachers or students of English literature or history. Few were alive in 1600 that lived in the days of the last Plantagenet and the first Tudor. To them, history was oral and immediate. Historical accuracy is not high on the Bard's priorities or of in those of his audiences. What matters is the interplay of characters, the tone and thrust of its plot and the relevance to its audiences. Thus there is a correlation between those Renaissance English audiences and most American audiences. How many Americans even know what the ""War of the Roses"" was about? Most would link it to the Mike Douglas/Kathleen Turner movie before a period of desperate political and military conflict, full of violence and treachery, ambition, greed and pride, in England which almost wiped out the old noble families and set the stage for Henry the VIII and Elizabeth Rex. The play uses the ""historical"" background to explore these issues. It has also been described as a piece of Tudor propaganda, written to buttress Elizabeth's legitimacy on the throne by painting the loser of the last conflict of the war as a villain, defeated by the hero, her grandfather. All this background and the richness of human emotion contained in the play come forth from this documentary like effort. Given the time constraints it does the best it can to set the stage and then draws you into the art of Shakespeare, as being as relevant today as in the reign of Elizabeth. Yes, it has its flaws, but there is no comparable effort out there that will enage a group of American teenagers and, maybe, just maybe, inspire a couple to give the Bard a second look. Keep in mind that something caught Kurasawa's attention to inspire him to produce so many Shakespeare plays within the context of Japanese history and myth, so maybe this will do the same for someone in our generation.",1119225600,23,2327,4.849246231155779
866032,4,6304393075,"I read ""Richard III"" last year and, I confess, there were times I got somewhat lost.  However, there were a lot of times that I found myself engrossed in this story of lust for power.  I'm not one to read Cliff Notes or other such helps; I prefer to just read the play.  I have found that, too often, such sources tend to direct your understanding away from where the text may have taken you.  Later on, I have found such sources helpful but I prefer to form my own first impressions.  ""Looking for Richard"" was, for me, a very helpful insight to ""Richard III"".

The main actor and director is Al Pacino who proceeds throughout the movie with an approach that facilitates the discovery of perspective (or maybe that should read perspective of discovery).  At times he asks people on the street what they think of Shakespeare and, in the case of one rather toothless man, works quite well.  He also uses other formats such as cast brainstorming sessions.  Other methods don't always work quite that well but we tend to get the points he strives to make.  All of this is interposed with scenes from the play itself.

There are some problems, however.  I noted earlier that not all of Pacino's ideas work.  There is a discussion about why Americans don't do Shakespeare well.  Well, I'm not sure that I accept the premiss although I think there was an American actor or two in this film that may have supplied supporting evidence.  Pacino is constantly involved with one ""expert"" in particular which I found contrary to the concept of looking at everything through a variety of perspectives.  I don't know that I necessarily disageed with anything this person had to say but I got tired of his near-exclusive right to an opinion.  I wanted to add that I felt the movie was too serious at times while too casual at other times.  However, the more I reflect on that point, the more I come to the conclusion that this is actually an asset of the movie.  Pacino approaches the subject seemingly unrehearsed and without any direction.  He questions everything and leaves us feeling that we discovered something together.",1111276800,5,2112,4.6567567567567565
866033,5,6304393075,"Those looking for authentic (i.e. veddy British) Shakespeare, look elsewhere.  For those of us who care about acting and plays, this is an enormous pleasure, such that at times you can imagine what it might have been like at the Globe in the 1600s.  It opens up the play in a number of different ways:  how actors attempt to understand motivation, the technical issues to surmount (an actor's body and voice are her instruments), and the historical nuances (that may not be the nuances they want for what is, after all, a FICTION.)

I was mesmerized the first time, but I know I didn't take it all in.  What I did take in was the exchange between Pacino and his collaborators.  This is something, especially in big picture hollywood, that rarely gets on the screen, but acting is a collaborative profession.  The director can be dictator but also he also can a coordinator, and the more character driven a production is, the more he must be.  (Which is why many of our younger directors like their toys, which are easier to manipulate.)  The clearest example of this is when Pacino brings in Ryder to play the young bride of Richard's foe, who he will marry once the latter is dead.  As an actor, Ryder is constrained by her celebrity and by her radiant looks.  And the age difference--which is in the play--is hazardous.  But we get to watch as Pacino aids Ryder is bringing out the failing shred of dignity in her character and we know well that he would not say, as director, that it was his doing.  The scene is one of the most powerful momemts of Shakespeare I have ever seen and gives me hope that the 80s emblematic waif will find her footing in a few years.

One hopes that Pacino gets more directing opportunities, but he shows with Looking for Richard that he is (and probably always been) a master of the craft.  So look at Looking for Richard and then look again.",1110412800,3,1875,4.505917159763314

I've been searching for this film for quite a while, and I'm glad it is again available.  It's a must-see for students of acting, Shakespeare, or both.

Al Pacino is faced with mounting a free production of Richard III in Central Park.  Along the way, he has to assemble his crew of actors and actresses, coordinate the production, and try to get his arms around one of the Bard's more difficult plays.

There is a world of difference in reading Shakespeare, and watching it on stage.  I think we've all done penance reading Shakespeare, with mixed results.  I've found the language in the abstract (i.e. simply reading the play) to be difficult.  Seeing it on stage (or screen) adds the visual element, that makes it more understandable.  (After all, the plays were meant to be seen, not read.)

866036,5,6304393075,"This 1996 part documentary part Richard III drama takes one of Shakespeare's greatest plays and makes it accessible.  Al Pacino has a mission:  to bring his love of Shakespeare to the mainstream.  This film shows him on the streets of New York City mainly in Central Park and the Cloisters.  He talks to people on the street about Shakespeare, acts the role of Richard III on the street, and even instructs a high school class.  The documentary intersperses these street scenes with scenes of the actual film performance and of the actors rehearsing and discussing the play, in a way reminicent of ""The French Leutenant's Woman"", but this one is actual documentary.
  Also included is a trip to England where Pacino visits Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon as well as the Tower of London.  We get a new respect for Pacino as he puts his all into this role, and his passion rubs off.  And we get to see the likes of Kevin Spacey and Winona Rider in roles alongside some British greats.  The discussion focuses on whether Americans can really grasp or act Shakespeare, and though perchance many Americans cannot, Pacino CAN.  Another discussion ponders whether actors like Pacino know more about Shakespeare than scholars who are interviewed, and the judgement is in some ways yes, in some no.  I do disagree with Al that you don't really have to know the meaning of ALL the lines, just the gist of it.  I really believe grasping the complete meaning will make it all the more valuable.
  But it is disheartening to know that after this great film came out we saw Pacino revert to stuff like ""The Devil's Advocate"" and more cops and robbers junk; on the other hand if they paid me millions I can't say I'd turn the stuff down myself.
  But one really covert irony to the whole thing is that there are some real parallels between Richard (off with their heads)the third and Michael Corleone.  Both tyrants who kill off the opposition (or possible opposition) including their own family members.  I'm sure this wasn't lost on Pacino....is it possible he took some of Shakespeare into his Corleone role?
  And of course Pacino nails Richard III, and with great sets and ominous music to contrast the lighter off the set stuff the most interesting aspect is his transformation from actor working on the role to becoming the role.

Pacino played Richard twice on stage (in 1973 and 1979) and both times he was blasted by the critics, for the simple and sufficient reason that he has no classical talent.  His only other venture into Shakespeare was as Marc Antony in an early 80s production of Julius Caesar:  here, too, the critics came to bury Al, not to praise him.  But nothing can daunt a stubborn egomaniac.  Well, almost nothing, for you'll note that this isn't a film version of Richard III, but rather a documentary about Pacino's ""search"" for the character.  Interesting, that.  Did Branagh make a film called ""Looking for Henry V""?  No, he made a film version of Henry V.  Did Olivier make a film called ""Looking for Othello""?  No, he made a film version of Othello.  So what's up here?  Why is Al presenting us with a ""search"" for the thing instead of the thing itself?  I'll give you three guesses.",980467200,12,925,4.670807453416149
866282,5,6304393075,"I was skeptical at the thought of this production: a documentary based on performing the play? But after ten minutes I was engrossed. Pacino does a great job of holding together what could've been just a disparate collection of scenes but the passion and thrill of performing Shakespeare comes through as never before. The 'behind-the-scenes' epsiodes are very revealing but, for me, it was the actual production of scenes from the play which worked the best. Pacino as Richard is extremely convincing. And Spacey as Buckingham puts in a wonderfully nuanced, clever and believeable turn. Try the 'I am not in the giving vein' scene for size. It is mesmerising. The feeling of a friendship (based solely on greed) turned sour comes across very vividly.  I have also seen the McKellan version and, dare I say it, much prefered this one. McKellen is good enough as Richard but he is let down by some seriously hammy acting from his fellow actors. Jim Broadbent is AWFUL as a Himmler-esque Buckingham. The declamation of the lines is poor incomparison with this version.  Watch it and enjoy - I did! I wish they had down a full version for the screen.",979257600,,1147,4.787878787878788
866283,4,6304393075,"I have to admit I was skeptical of watching Al Pacino try his hand at ANY Shakespeare, much less Richard III, which isn't the easiest play to put on in the first place.  But by the end I actually quite enjoyed the whole production, even if I wouldn't call it a masterpiece.
I'd recommend this film to anybody who enjoys the Bard, live at Stratford or even if it's some over-the-top movie version--and particularly for high school students who are still a little too dense to totally 'get' Shakespeare.  It's informative for the uninitiated, and as a documentary, it works reasonably well, and moves at a brisk enough pace so you're not bored stiff.
Add to that some particularly insightful words from Derek Jacobi, and Sir John Gielgud (amongst others), it's well worth a rental, and doesn't embarrass any of the actors who were smart enough to take part in this.
And as a reminder to the bloke who trashed this in favour of Ian McKellen's excellent turn as Richard III, this wasn't meant to compete, but instead to enlighten the masses.  Who to be quite honest, COULD understand Shakespeare if they put their minds to it, but most don't.
They're usually forced to in grade nine at best.",979171200,3,1187,4.669856459330144
866284,4,6304393075,"I LOVED IT--ESP. THE DISCUSSION FROM THE ACTORS AND DIRECTOR CONCERNING THE MOTIVES OF THE CHARACTERS.  ONE NEEDS SOME FAMILIARTY WITH THE PLAY TO REALLY FOLLOW THE MOVIE.  IT APPEARS LIKE THE FILM (RICHARD THE 3)WAS MADE AND I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO GET A COPY OF IT.  SO IF ANYONE KNOWS IF THIS IS SO AND WHERE IT CAN BE OBTAINED, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT.",975801600,,356,4.2835820895522385
866285,1,6304393075,"Easily the worst feat of Al Pacino's career, with his over-the-top, laughable performance in ""The Devil's Advocate"" falling into a close second place. The film's basic assumption -- that the audience is  somehow 'incapable' of understanding Shakespeare's Richard III and must  have it spelled out for them -- is insulting, Pacino's hamminess a grand  embarrassment. He obviously wanted <badly> to top Ian McKellen's  brilliant performance as Richard (earlier the same year), but while  McKellen gives a dynamite performance (clever, subtle and extremely funny),  Pacino is laughable. After an hour, you'll either fall asleep or get a  migrane. In addition, McKellen imbued his adaptation with new Shakespearean  insights by crafting a WWII-era, Nazi interpretation; as Richard III gains  power, the mise-en-scene subtly grows colder and more fascistic. Pacino, on  the other hand, relies on a stiff, heavy, traditional interpretation of  Shakespeare and will probably discourage most unfamiliar viewers from  picking up the play. Forget about this mess, and take a look at McKellen's  version instead.",960681600,9,1101,5.640243902439025

866287,5,6304393075,"Looking For Richard was more than a search for Richard III (a tyrannical character of Shakespeare's), it was a search for the star whom played him - Al Pacino.  The film was filled with the actor's personal insights and  discoveries about Shakespeare and his American audience.  Through Pacino's  insights you learn of an enigmatic star who is as normal as you and I. If  you are a Pacino fan, you might enjoy him even more when he's not acting!",948844800,,445,4.582278481012659
866288,5,6304393075,"For those who are not yet convinced of Pacino's brilliance and skill, you have yet to view this film.  A flawless, insightful depiction of Shakespeare's classic villain, Richard III.  Pacino's indulgent depth into  the motives and tendencies of the ruthless King of England give the viewer  a sense of not only the tragedy of court life, but the depth to which such  a role can be played.  I have never seen a performance of Richard to this  day that comes close to Pacino's,not even Olivier.  The powerhouse cast  serves to fully boost this movie into place as one of the greatest  shakespearean interpretations ever.  Pacino's mastery and control as soon  as he steps into the tower of London evokes a sense of confidence that his  mind and soul are intact...that we are in for a treat.  The vast gestures  and soliloquies of flying arms are not needed in traditional English  fashion.  This film humanizes the role, which is hardly ever done.  It  catches what Shakespeare hoped would be captured, the humanity of his  heroes and villains and how it simplifies the most complex and evil of  deeds.  In humanizing them, we understand them better.  Richard's plot  stemmed not only from a deep rooted hunger for the throne, but a hunger to  dethrone Edward and enjoy torturing those who did not recognize his kingly  qualities.....we get a sense of Richard's indulgence in the plot as it  moves along and his deceitfully satisfying nature.  Superb performances  from F. murray Abraham and Kevin Spacey (Buckingham).  The only downside to  this film:  Wynona Ryder's shallow, unconvincing portrayal of Lady Anne.  It is arguable that the role itself was meant to be shallow, if so, she  performed beautifully.  Pacino never seems to amaze me though.",943747200,5,1749,4.913793103448276

Pacino has the bug and felt compelled to use his influence to see if he could generate some interest among those many who find themselves indifferent.  I'd take it appropriate that this is called 'Looking for Richard'; the group is documented searching for a Richard that will be useful to just these people.  Much of the pleasure is being privy to the group effort on display.  About 15 percent of those posting here are negative.  They give many reasons but I seem to detect a feeling that they prefer more refinement than the groundling oriented performance this might be.  Having seen several productions available on DVD I still cannot decide whether this should precede or follow the viewing of one or more of those.  Generally a good ride from start to finish, though I had a bump along the way.",1474761600,,977,4.678362573099415
