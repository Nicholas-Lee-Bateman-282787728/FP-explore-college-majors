Also, the fact that they didn't include everything about & receiving the Heisman Trophy made a complete void in his football accomplishments, and not including this and his speech regarding Pearl Harbor, is totally wrong!!!!!",1484006400,,345,5.017543859649122
8720774,4,B00ZRBQJIE,"Long before my time, but was always fascinated by stories about Minnesota's only Heisman Trophy winner.
Seemed that he was an 'All-American' boy from a small town in Minnesota who was considered for sainthood prior to his death at a relatively early age.
As expected, movie was typical, early '40s Hollywood fare but thoroughly enjoyed seeing actual game footage of Smith and '40 and '41 Minnesota National Champions.",1448064000,,417,5.147058823529412
