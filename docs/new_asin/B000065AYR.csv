7960814,5,B000065AYR,"...I first saw this on Tech TV, which is rather odd since Tech TV doesn't exacly scream anime. I too thought at first when I saw one of its commercials, ""the cast is all women? Great, nothing but a wet boys anime"". Boy was I wrong. First off, Katsumi and her friends actually have real depth. They don't just stand around yelling at things with huge heads (you know, to emphasize
that they're yelling) and flexing off their sexiness in thongs. The fact that they're women doesn't really come into play that much, and they don't just sit around talking about guys the whole episode. Each one them has an in depth back story, as well as distinct powers making each one of them unique, and no two are exactly alike. What I also loved was the fact that each one of them had their own episode which showed more of the character to the viewer than you would previously know. Also, there is no 1 character who become the center of attention constantly. Sure the story is about Katsumi, but not one character gets ignored. I wish other animes would do this, since it is the proper way to tell a story, and not burn the viewer out on a character.
The villians are creatures called Lucifer Hawks which are demons. In a bizzare twist of fate they become connected to our world and start screwing things up royally by eatting people and such (we're their food source, oh joy). That's where our heros come in. While it may sound like it reduces to a Power Rangers or Sailer Moon type of ordeal, each battle has its own unique twist that makes it interesting and makes use of each characters powers. There's also half human/lucifer hawks that cause Katsumi and pals much grief later on as well. In fact, I liked every villian as well. They were intelligent, and had their own unique motive for why they do what they do. It's rare to see a bad guy not being bad just for the sake of it now days.
The music is also welcome, from the excellent beginning theme to the in show tracks which play. After hearing it I bought the sound track just to get Forbidden Pause. If you know me personally, you'd know that I'm very picky about my music. But this sound track just clicks just right and you'll be humming it while walking around work and such.
All in all this is one of the few rare animes which has no glaring flaws, just 1 annoying character. The stories are well thought out, the animation is excellent, the music is soothing, the characters act like actual people and not sex objects, the voice acting is good, and the villians are great. I will admit that some battles did get kinda cheesy when the monsters shout ""It's the AMP!"" like it was Mr T and the A-Team busting onto the scene or something, but on a whole this is 1 anime that you should not miss. Why it's not popular I'll never know, but if you can spread the good word after watching it, that will hopefully change.",1060646400,3,2864,4.375234521575985
7960815,5,B000065AYR,"Imagine this: You're walking down the alley one night, and something pops out and eats you.
 This is no rip-off ladies and gentlemen, this is Silent Mobius, the 1980's pop-culture manga phenomemnon remastered for this century. It's EXCELLENT.
Silent Mobius follows the adventures of Katsumi Liquer, a young woman who is indeed a mage in 21st century Tokyo, post apocolypse style. It turns out her father, archmage Gigelf had secrets, inlcluding unlocking the gate to NEMESIS, and relesing the flesh-eatting Lucifer Hawk upon the unsuspecting planet. In this wild and original blend of technology and magic, the all-female AMP (Attack Mystification Police) battles the Lucifer Hawk. With romance, plot twists, secrets untold and pleanty of beautiful women, this anime is sure to please both men and women alike. The animation is beautiful, as is Kia Asayama's art style. The dubbing was fairly good actually.
The opening theme 'Kindan no Pense' or 'Forbiden Thoughts' is excellent, as is the opening animation. The background music was also excellent, bordering classical.
All of the characters are PEOPLE, adding to the show. Katsumi in particular is constantly plagued by her own inner demons, especially later in the series. We also see Kiddy Phenil, who has a dirty secret all her own.
All in all, this is definetely something ANY anime fan should get. It's a classic, and a stunning one at that.
A viewer, you have obviously just recently been introduced to anime. I've seen 150+ titles, and this is in my top 10.
Buy this, pat yourself on the back, watch it, and then watch it again.
Overall grade: 9/10

7960816,5,B000065AYR,"First of all, this is not a movie (there are two movies made years ago), this is the first 9 episodes of the (much newer) television series, 2 discs with a whopping 225 minutes of material.  You get your money's worth.
Second, the visuals/animation for a television series can't possibly compare to the two earlier movies... but plot-wise, the television series wins hands-down.  Not only does it conform much more closely to the original manga/comic series, but it gives you a chance to get to know all of the other characters involved.  There's room to develop multiple plots.  Both of the movies revolved around Katsumi to the exclusion of other characters, and they were both also told completely in flashback mode which is not a good way to tell a story.  They're both worth watching, but as introductions to the various cast members and multiple plot threads of the comic, they fall very short.  So I'm very glad that the tv series has come out.
Third, it amuses me that someone knows how ""awful"" this series is after watching only ten minutes of it, and reccomends stories made for children instead.  Let's just say that Silent Mobius is a little more complex, story-wise, than Pokemon.  You might as well say that, after watching a full ten minutes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, you realized it was the worst television series ever and reccomend watching Rugrats or Spongebob Squarepants instead.
Speaking of Buffy, what you get with Silent Mobius is a dark futuristic tale of good people with special powers fighting off evil demonic entities... it has a little of that Bubblegum Crisis / Battle Angel Alita cyberpunk feel, a little Lovecraftian horror, and a little of that Neon Genesis Evangelion ""it's the end of the world as we know it, and mankind's making one last desperate stand"" flavor.  It's also one of those animes where all of the major characters are female, although two have boyfriends who are background characters without special powers.
Not the most amazing anime in the world, but a fun series nonetheless.  And by the way, much more compelling than Gundam Wing, Pokemon, and Galaxy Express 666.",1052956800,4,2123,4.85595567867036
7960817,4,B000065AYR,"Silent Mobius is a sometimes confusing story about a group of police officers in the future who were charged with repelling an extra dimensional invasion by a creature called Lucifer Hawk.  I remember seeing an earlier version of this story back in the '80s, this seems to be a remake of the original story.  The animation is pretty good, I've seen better.  You do get a lot of story for your money when you buy this DVD, I think it's around 140 minutes.  Bottom line: it's worth checking out.",1039824000,,493,4.50561797752809
7960818,5,B000065AYR,"I must express my surprise when i saw that no reviews have been written for this amazing show,when i bought the first volume i immediately wished to buy the remaining volumes. The main problem that some see with the show is its lack of coherence, but this is not true , since what the show was all about is the love story between Roy and Katsumi , Kiddy and Ralph , Yuki and Toru , and the antagonistic relationship between Rally  and Rosa. Viewed in that context the show is more than coherent. That also explains why many episodes don't feature so much action , but instead explain those relationships. For example there are two episodes with megadynes , one of which is simply stunning, and the episode where Yuki meets Toru in 1999 was very touching. Also the only ones  mentioning the lucifer hawk as aliens are the media and some of the officials but not AMP itself. They know the truth and call them demons not exraterestrials. There was never a sudden turn to magic since the show was always involved with that , just look at the scene with which it starts  and you will immediately understand it is about magic and not aliens. Katsumi from the begining uses spells and not technology ,esp or anything else. It is unfair to state that it doesn't end since it was interested in the stories between the characters more than the fight against the lucifer hawk. I haven't read the manga yet so i don't know how that chapter ends but some issues were resolved and other shows ended in such a convoluted way that it is refreshing to see a show that ends in a positive way. The cgi dragon is not exactly state of the art, but is that enough to blame the whole show;This anime is best viewed in japanese. Promising a continuation is not bad ,it is an optimistic way which is not so frequent in anime lately where most shows flaunt philosophy that does not really add to the show. The message is clear:""We go on and that is human because we can love"".It is told in the excelent theme song and every great song in the series for that matter.",1038873600,2,2039,4.403183023872679
7960819,5,B000065AYR,"I read much of the original manga to this, but was blown away with the quality and pace of the anime.  A great addition to any collection and a good price.",1026950400,,155,4.0
7960820,5,B000065AYR,"This is one of the best anime series that I saw in my life, very dark design and gothic buildings, remember me Tim Burton's Batman and Blade Runner movies.  Very recommendable.
I hope that the movies will be release too.  I got the movies and they are better than the series also.",1025827200,2,280,4.365384615384615
