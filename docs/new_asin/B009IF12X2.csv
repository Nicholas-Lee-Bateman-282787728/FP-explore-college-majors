8541843,4,B009IF12X2,"It's ironic that the cover photo for this DVD (Toscanini and his grand-daughter Emanuela at Riverdale in 1956) is not in fact unreleased but was published in ""The Magic Baton"" by Filippo Sacchi in 1957.  That having being said, there is little here to offer the 'serious' Toscanini enthusiast.  Since the British voice-overs sound rather cheesy, for English speaking viewers it's best to play the video in Italian with English subtitles.

However, the video has many merits.  It is wonderful to see the late Walfredo Toscanini and Emanuela di Castelbarco talk so lovingly about their grandfather.  About their formative years together with the Maestro in Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and New York, and how devoted, caring and loving a father and grandfather he was.  This is the first time I have heard Emanuela talk at length about her grandfather.  As ever, the home movies (presumably taken by Walter Toscanini) are fascinating and revealing, and show just how relaxed and carefree Toscanini was in the company of his family and close friends.

We will never see the likes of Arturo Toscanini again, and the golden age of opera and the symphony orchestra has long since passed.  As far as Toscanini's eminent position in musical history is concerned, only Emanuela, as his last surviving grandchild, now provides that crucial personal link to those cultured days of a bygone world.",1359331200,16,1384,5.088495575221239
8541844,4,B009IF12X2,"Thought there is no real sound footage of the great - and tempermental - conductor in this 67 minute Italian-produced documentary until the end, it is an interesting document, consisting of rare SILENT family footage of the man and many lengthy interviews with both his granddaughter and grandson. All the interviews - except for the manager of Carnegie Hall in NYC - are in Italian but they are translated aurally. Filmed in Italy, Switzerland and New York State, the film provides a background on the conductor's personality and family life. VERY little about his career. But the info will appeal to the Classical Music lover who wants to delve deeper into his personal life.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
