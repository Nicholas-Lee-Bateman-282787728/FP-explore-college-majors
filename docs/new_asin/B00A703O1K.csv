8547442,2,B00A703O1K,Really disappointed movie. Performing is terrible and music is even worse.,1410739200,,74,5.818181818181818
8547443,4,B00A703O1K,"An artisan who creates elaborate origami houses, a punk rock star who's near his nadir while his girlfriend is a rising star, a woman who communicates with the dead, a son who learns fast the manipulative ways of real estate - these characters lives are intertwined as they all try to find a place of their own in the complex machinations of modern-day Taipei.

The film is well-paced, the actors genuine in their portrayals. The story lines are for the most part satisfactorily resolved, except for one, in my opinion. But then again, given the title of the film, it's probably a resolution that is good enough. Sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to spoil anything.

I would watch this again, so it's good enough for that.",1398816000,,730,4.651162790697675
8547444,4,B00A703O1K,"A surprisingly good flic.  The characters are both believable and interesting.  The situation that each person finds themselves in, is dramatically realistic.  The lead character is funny, subtle, and interesting.",1391472000,,213,6.033333333333333
