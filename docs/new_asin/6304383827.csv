861265,2,6304383827,"Disappointing --
 in acting (I am always the last person to criticize acting, but here it distracted me from early on and became laughable at the very end;
 in score (no score might have been preferable to the repetitive & distracting Vertigo-ish, um, music);
 and in the overall plot, which may strike many viewers as original, but I've seen it before (at least once, if not more).

I also don't quite see the reason for the early 1960s (I think) setting. Does the filmmaker think people were less cynical then or what? From what I know of American social, cultural & religious history, a 1920s setting would have been more appropriate.",1520812800,,637,4.711711711711712
861266,1,6304383827,"Excellent version of Emma  we have several and my wife likes this one the best. So why one star? In order to get two shows on one DVD, the movies are heavily compressed and the picture quality is so poor that it is unenjoyable. The picture is the most heavily letter boxed I've seen, occupying only a relatively small portion of the TV screen, and even within that the picture quality is mediocre. Luckily this same movie is available as a standalone DVD, so we are going to now go out and buy the one we should have bought in the first place (you win some, you lose some  I'm giving this one away to the local thrift store). Hopefully the separate version is the original quality (I've seen it on a copy owned by the public library, so I know the quality problems are on this DVD pressing, not my player or TV). Apparently it has never been released on Bluray, too bad, fine acting and a light-hearted atmosphere (the 6-hour version shown on public TV, which I actually prefer because of superior character development, is much heavier and more serious). In sum - want a two-fer? Ya get what ya pay for.",1520380800,,1104,4.4068627450980395

861350,5,6304383827,"I began watching this with low expectations, but they grew quickly. It isn't the truest adaptation of the book I've seen, but it might have been the most engaging. Gwyneth Paltrow did a fine job of making Emma as sweet and genuinely likable as everyone around her believes her to be. Too often, she's portrayed as a flighty girl without a shred of sense, emphasizing her youth over her keen interest in others' happiness. I was pleased to see her portrayed as someone Mr. Knightly could possibly be interested in. But perhaps my biggest surprise was Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly. He's usually portrayed as being rather stodgy, but not here. In this, he's honorable and dignified, certainly, but he's also warm and, dare I say, funny. Together, they're perfect. Their attraction and attachment to each other seem natural and completely plausible. The chemistry between them is unmistakable. If I had to pick one scene as an ""audition"" that determines whether I'm going to like it or not, it would be the scene where Mr. Knightly scolds Emma for humiliating Miss Bates (brilliant, flawless casting there, and a brilliant performance on that role throughout). Too often, Mr. Knightly sounds as if he's punishing a dog for peeing on the carpet, not speaking with someone he actually cares about. But Northam's Knightly was as stern as the situation demanded while being in obvious agony over the necessity of hurting someone he cared about. And Paltrow's Emma was as contrite as she should be while being in obvious mortification over her own misconduct (not to mention having it pointed out by someone she respects). I could not have been more pleased with the way that scene was played. I know that in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, people conducted their courtship with more restraint than we're used to seeing, but it was such a welcome relief to witness identifiable signs of romantic inclination between the leads. The way Northam delivers ""indeed, we are not"" when Emma tells him that they may dance together because they are not brother and sister made my house seem a bit warmer than it really was. In fact, I think I'm going to watch this again right now.",1509235200,2,2176,4.852150537634409

All three times the movie freezes at the exact same place and there is nothing you can do to unfreeze it. There is also a high pitch buzz which is very alarming. The only thing to do is to switch off the power, reboot and remove the DVD. I'm extremely disappointed as there was a long time between the second and third purchase and you would think the manufacturers would have fixed it by now.

861378,3,6304383827,"This fllm could have been made a lot better.  I used to love this film until I actually read Emma and I watched the much better British produced versions of this one.  The real winner in this film is the fantastic Oscar winning musical score by Rachel Portman, the first woman to win an Oscar in that category.  I often work to the soundtrack music as it plays in the background while I type on my computer like now.  I know that Paltrow just came off of winning her Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, which wasnt' really the best picture of that year.  Saving Private Ryan was but Disney did its best, as usual to sway often fickle Hollywood in the voting process.  The trouble is that the triangle of love already set up in the storyline between Frank Churchill, Jane Fairfax and Emma Woodhouse isn't really established in this film and Emma's relationship to the Knightley family isn't well established as well. There is no way that Jeremy Northam is sixteen years Emma's age in this film.  The whole archery scene, while amusing was never written into the story and I know that it was a sort of tribute to the 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice.  That being written, the fact that Emma has a very limited view of anything due to her all contolling father who has always treated his youngest  daughter as the apple of his eye.  Mr. Woodhouse is described by Jane Austen as a silly man and George Knightly makes it his mission in life to assist a growing Emma to not end up so silly.  This is why the whole matchmaking scheme is ludicrous in George's mind and it makes a hell of a lot of sense. How many clueless socialites did Emma see matched to partners, mostly husbands, who were total mismatches and how many of these women, after being married, actually stood up to their husbands in a society where it was common for men to spank their wives? I get it and Hollywood loves to cast people whom they believe will be great box office draws.  The huge issue of the whole outing to Boxing Hill is a case in point and if Westons hadn't cluelessly invited the Vicar Elton and his shrew of a wife, then the whole making fun of Miss Bates wouldn't have happened at all. I will note though that the final comment while the newly married couple walks underneath the arbor with well-wishers throwing rice and flowers, Mrs. Elton's comment about ""the lack of satin"" is taken right from the book.  Much of the humor, irony and whit of Austen is lost in this effort to produce a Hollywood romance which is just a step above something I wouls see on the Hallmark channel.  I did purchase this for my streaming library and I do watch it once in a while. I also own the much longer version of Emma and Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller are definitely cast at the lead roles.",1507766400,,2761,4.398821218074656

861401,4,6304383827,"Recently in a review of another one of the film adaptations of Jane Austens romantic novels, Northanger Abbey, I mentioned that what got me started on reviewing some of Ms. Austens novels was a film review of The Jane Austen Book Club a modern day look at romance via the prism of her six major novels. I also mentioned in that review that the works of Jane Austen when I was young, when I was in high school say, growing up in a rough and tumble working class neighborhood dominated by a corner boy culture were tightly wrapped in seven seals. No self-respecting corner boy would read, or admit to reading, such girl books short of some classroom command. I was in the former camp since I never read her material not was commanded to do so again my will. Those reading experiences came later when I was much more serious about investigating the great works of English literature-and not under the gun either.

Another point made in that review was that once I got onto some subject, literary or otherwise, I tended to play out my hand, tended to grab everything I could by an author or as here in this review of Ms. Austens  Emma  film adaptations of those works. Heres whats what, heres why many generations of girls, and hopefully, now hopefully, boys, enjoyed reading her books and equally hopefully after reading the books viewing film adaptations as well.

Ms. Jane Austen had a razor sharp sense of the customs, mores, and foibles of the country gentry from whence she came. The mating rituals as well. In Emma, here played by fetching Gwyneth Paltrow, she takes a tongue and check yet romantic look the matchmaking among the young country set in early 19th  England just as the Industrial Revolution is beginning to shift England from an isolated rural society to king of the hill world industrial power. Emma is by turns very smart, very well brought and something of an incurable romantic once she takes a funny stab at matchmaking among the younger set. Her victim her friend Harriet, sort of country bumpkin, female version whom she tries to match up with several eligible young men, including Mr. Knightley, played by Jeremy Northam. The film then revolves around the mishaps and errors of judgment by Ms. Emma in her chosen profession up to and including encouraging the relationship between Harriet and Mr. Knightley. Oops. As it turned out Emma was mad for Mr. Knightley when she thought she was losing him. Not to worry everything works out in the end. Pure Jane Austen but read the book first-okay.",1503014400,,2516,4.696145124716553

The 2009 version showed how they could take more liberties with the book but present the essence of the book so much better. This adaptation was lacking in feeling. The characters and relationships were not developed as they should be - maybe one of the reasons was lack of time to do the novel justice. My favorite actor from this adaptation is Jeremy Northam. Having said that, I prefer Jonny Lee Miller's Mr. Knightley to Jeremy Northam's. The 2009 BBC version is superior to this version in all regards, according to me. I could not like or empathize with Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. But then Emma is a JA heroine who is harder to empathize with, than her other heroines. If you are not a purist and you want to watch a good adaptation of Emma, do watch the 2009 BBC version and skip this movie.",1497484800,,964,4.391061452513966

When I first saw this movie, I liked it well enough for entertainment purposes.  I'd watch it every once in a while and enjoy myself.  I haven't seen this version for years so I was really happy when I saw it on Prime.  And then the movie started.

This Emma is just...  There's period drama and there's caricature of period drama, and this comes off as caricature.  Watching it after so many  years, it was like eating old french fries.  They were really good when they were freshly made, but time was not kind to them.  Goop's version is so fussy that it is cringe-inducing.  Which is a shame because she is perfectly an Emma, and with better direction she could've been an Emma for the ages.  At least there's the 2009 BBC version.

Bear in mind that the BBC Pride & Prejudice with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth is from 1995, so let's not blame the 1990s for how poorly this Emma aged.",1494547200,,1027,4.37037037037037

861533,5,6304383827,"The 1996 film of Emma with Douglas McGrath as both director and screenwriter is a fine film adaptation of Jane Austen's 1815 novel. Itand  has a wonderfully witty script, is generally well acted by a mostly British cast, beautifully shot in an almost storybook fashion and accompanied by Rachel Portman's buoyant score. Unless you are one of those who are inclined to dislike the material itself, it's practically all one could wish for in a film inspired by Austen's lightest novel. As usual those who have read the books may complain about this or that but as films go this one is very true to the original story, leaving little out. It differs mostly in tone being generally lighter and more comic than Austen who at times can be quite biting in her observations of her characters. still, some of the best barbs, as Emma's comments to Harriet about farmer Robert Martin are quoted verbatim from Austen herself. The director keeps things moving by providing swift transitions from one scene to the next: no sooner than someone is mentioned in conversation or a letter than suddenly they are there without the need to film the intervening material.

The role was practically made for Gwyneth Paltrow, then a new, up and coming presence on the screen, just four years older than Emma in the book. Emma in her core has a good heart and, as Austen says, her flaws were mainly of having had things her own way far too often and a rather strong tendency to think too well of herself. She is independently wealthy (her thirty-thousand pounds was inherited from a relative), young,beautiful and intelligent but also somewhat snobbish and very class conscious, and having spent her entire life at Hartfield and Highbury as the belle of the local gentry is quite clueless about the lives of others, especially those beneath her social station. Gwyneth herself was much like Emma, essentially well-intended, young and beautiful, raised in a special Hollywood set that included having Steven Spielberg as her godfather and inclined in her Goop blog (before it went all-commercial) to dispense advice like never scrimp on your personal stylist, spray the air with liquid silver before sitting down in a plane seat and should you for some unknown reason find yourself having to fly coach (gasp) simply buy the whole row of seats so no one can sit down near you.

Gwyneth mastered the accent well enough, trained in singing and archery and studied the social rules of the period in preparation for the role. She is wonderfully supported by Jeremy Northam, who makes a fine Austen hero as Mr. Knightley. Toni Colette is quite the self-doubting acolyte as Harriet and gained weight for the role. The garrulous Miss Bates and her silent mother are convincingly played by an unrecognizable Sophie Thompson and Phillida Law, the sister and mother of actress Emma Thompson. The older characters were all well done. I have some reservations about Ewan McGregor's Frank Churchill. Fresh from Trainspotting, he was looking for something quite different to show he had range, but seemed a bit too affable at times and not as shallowly conceited as he should be. He's also supposed to be a dashing young man, but tha.t was undercut by a horrible wig that made him look like a wet cocker spaniel. He later disavowed the wig in interviews as a great mistake.

The characters of Mr. Elton and his bride Augusta (nee Hawkins) were deliberately changed to make them more broadly comic figures. In the book he is supposed to be quite handsome and she quite beautiful, which is hardly the case here. Juliet Stevenson's Augusta obviously needed her thousands of pounds that would always be called ten, to attract a husband. Alan Cumming's Mr. Elton seemed not so much handsome as a kind of twit in the way British actor Murray Melvin was in similar roles in british films of the 60's and 70's. Fot this film's conception of them they were quite well chosen.

Though the film was favorably received by most critics and a hit with the public, making back four times its cost in its first run alone, it had its criticisms. These mostly revolved around the film being ""too pretty"" with the realistic circumstances of the era glossed over. There was great poverty in the country, many people were wretched, etc. Also, the film hardly showed any of the vast army of servants required to keep up the opulent life of the gentry. This may be partially true but is beside the point in almost every way. Jane Austen was a great observer and satirist of country life but never some kind of social realist or reformer. This is the Regency Period, well before Charles Dicken's time when the Industrial Revolution and its vast Satanic mills had advanced far enough to create terrible conditions that needed reforming. Highbury is essentially Surrey - Box Hill, where the picnic takes place is an actual site in Surrey - not the Midlands, and Jane describes her Highbury as a place where everyone was well fed. Interestingly, the Industrial Revolution was being felt even in Highbury where lowly tradespeople like Mr. Weston and even moreso, the Clarks, were becoming so wealthy that they had fine houses and felt free to invite the gentry to their dinners and parties. This provides a wonderful joke as Emma awaits their invitation so she can refuse it only to have to show up as all the other gentry had accepted. For much of the Jane Austen film and television adaptation audience this world of hers is somewhat of a romantic place where everyone dresses so nicely and lives so well that it's more like a fairy tale world than an actual place.

The real problem with Jane Austen adaptations is that if you haven't read the books they are a challenging thing to figure out. You are presented, usually quite quickly with a large assortment of characters who you have little time to absorb. Not only are some related to each other but they exist in a world of by now bewildering rules of class and behavior that can be incomprehensible, especially if you are a newcomer to the genre. At least Emma is independently wealthy and isn't in a situation where she must marry or be ruined. At least there are no legal complexities like the Bennet's entailed estate in Pride and Prejudice. But there are still many complexities like Frank Churchill who is the son of Mr. Weston by his first wife but was adopted by his aunt  of the Churchills in Yorkshire and had to take their name and only see his father once a year in London. (His mother, a daughter of the gentry, had married beneath her: Mr. Weston, a Captain in the army when they married, was a tradesman. His aunt took him in to preserve the family bloodline lest he become lowly like the very respectable Mr. Weston) See how complicated and strange it gets to someone today?

I cautiously recommend checking various online sources that describe the characters, but must warn you that some of them give too many plot points away and can spoil the film. Most of it is actually spoken of in the film but you have to listen to everything very carefully. This is especially true of characters like the Dixons and Campbells who aren't actually present in the film but have some importance in the plot. I do believe, however that this film is so well made that it can be enjoyed no matter how much or how little one knows about Jane Austen and Emma.",1494201600,8,7346,4.720187061574435

But Mark Strong's interpretation of Mr. Knightly was superior. I've watched boh films before, but this time I watched them again within a couple of days to compare them. Some scenes in one are omitted in the other, and vice-versa. I particularly liked the scene in the chapel in this version, which was not included in the ITV version, although I do not remember if it is in the novel. Overall, I think casting was better done in the ITV adaptation, but others may reach a different conclusion.",1469318400,,697,4.721311475409836

I do not have a blue ray player, and I'm not particular about high definition, or anything like that, but this dvd has some serious issues.  There were lots of places in the movie that reminded me of watching those old movies on projectors in the school auditorium.  The picture looked a little funny and stretched out, and there were lots of ""spots"" on the film.  Also, there was one whole scene, and part of another scene that suddenly displayed subtitles.  I stopped the film and checked the settings to make sure that subtitles were turned off (they were).  Went back to the movie, subtitles were still displayed.

If you love Emma the novel, the Kate Beckinsale version is the best and truest to the tone, dialogue and characters of the book, but if you just want a witty period film or an introduction to Jane Austen, this gets five stars. Gwyneth Paltrow lent her signature class to the role of the spoiled and petty Emma, Jeremy Northam adds a romantic touch to Mr Knightley, but keeps up his stern lecturing angle, and Ewan McGregor plays the selfish and dull Frank as merely ditzy and terribly in love.  The sets and pastel elegant of the costumes are amazing, and the soundtrack blends wonderfully with the dialogue, never drowning it out.

BUT I loved it. Harriet was so ditzy, which made it funny. Emma was a little snotty. Compared to the book it sucked, so if you're looking for a play by play of the book then don't bother but if you're looking for a light hearted, cute movie then definitely watch it!  I recommend Pride and Prejudice with Kiera Knightly, Mansfield Park with chick from Bedazzled, and Sense and Sensibility with Kate Winslet. Persuasion is good, but doesn't rank as high for me as the three previous listed. Good watching Austen fans!",1428278400,,680,4.528455284552845

Gwyneth was the it girl at the time, thus they were putting her in everything.",1428278400,5,370,4.967741935483871

862693,3,6304383827,"As a rendition of Emma the movie followed the book well enough. However, I still find that the 2009 version is superior in every way. This one is almost exactly like it--it's funny, can make you laugh at the ridiculousness of Austen's society that she herself laughed at, and cringe as well--but my personal favorite part of every Austen story--the romance--was lacking. Emma and Mr. Knightly for the first part of the movie are likable enough, however, even though we are given a couple of hints that he's fallen in love with her near the end, there is no tension or suspense, of which I became completely aware. In the moment Mr. Knightly and Emma have together before he leaves for London to visit his brother, Mr. Knightly kisses Emma's hand...Just as any friend might, whereas in the book and in the 2009 rendition, he ALMOST kisses her hand, which would have shouted loud and clear his confusion about his own feelings for her. Alas, in this rendition, their romance can be summed up as a fond friendship where the movie makers forced it into a love story that just didn't fit. Mr Knightly was too much Emma's friend in this one, not stern or mentorly at all. They just didn't fit. The movie is a good lighthearted laugh though.",1422576000,,1234,4.613636363636363
862694,4,6304383827,"Overall, I would give this four stars.  I love the music by Rachel Portman!  She makes the movie more sentimental.

I suggest this version to anyone.",1421712000,,320,4.943396226415095

I have watched the BBC 2009 version on TV and loved it but thought I'd chance this one because of Paltrow playing Emma. The story just felt rushed over all and the cast was dreadful. Knightly was frightly. I just did not care for him.

I think you'd enjoy the BBC version better it is longer and allowed you to see the true spirit of the characters, and the ending when Knightly pronounces his affection for Emma it is one of the most romantic kisses ever. The price for it is ridiculous. I was shocked to see the cost before shipping. I've paid less for four movies.

The movie is pure face to face dialog.  Not everyone is a dialog hound. Unlike transformer action, the brain must be engaged to infer personality from dialog.  Nothing harder than developing or revealing personality. Watching (the eye candy) and listening to Austin's dialog is like seeing a master, Venus Williams, Magic Johnson, in action - pure pleasure.",1400803200,,531,5.309523809523809

864130,1,6304383827,I decided to watch this since I am a fan of GP however this was by far one of the most boring movies I have ever viewed somehow I stayed awake during the show. I am sure GP loved the acting but I would much rather prefer a movie like Shallow Hal which she just made for the money. Well I guess I'll never be a movie critic.,1400544000,,323,3.764705882352941

Beautiful scenery and period costumes in this Jane Austen novel on the screen.  Gwyneth Paltrow is about the same age as the character she plays - 22 years old - when this movie was made.  She is lovely and she and all the actors held my attention.  How to be honest and kind as you go through life is still the same question two hundred years after Jane Austen wrote this.

864262,5,6304383827,"True to her original intent, this is a VERY subversive little film. As we are charmed by the characters, the story, the dialogue, the incredibly beautiful locations, the cinematography and Rachel Portman's delicious score, we also experience the dark side of the idle 19th century rich including their obsession with class, ""marrying well"", balls, dinners and other trivialities. The most striking moments for me in this film, however, are those that illuminate the terrible suffering of the poor and the self-centered ignorance of their ""benefactors"". Emma's kind weekly visits and gifts do very little where generosity with her great fortune could have done so much more.",1397692800,,673,5.3584905660377355

I find it hard to watch the English period pieces, particularly those that are about the upper class and their daily trials and tribulations. I can't help but be thinking about the real problems during the time period and how out of touch the upper class was with the poor, as it is still going on today. This is a good movie if you enjoy this type of story, otherwise avoid it since it is no a great movie on any level.",1397088000,,481,4.127659574468085

I know Emma's nature was that of an interfering and judgmental young woman, however, why would the director think it necessary to have Gwyneth Paltrow be so obviously annoying and cloying.  This was no Masterpiece Theatre  production....just Hollywood doing a bad job.

I do not recommend it.",1397088000,5,408,4.869565217391305

864317,3,6304383827,"It's okay but there's another version of Emma done in 2009 with Jonny Lee Miller (from Elementary) that's a lot better. The characters were lacking some depth, and you didn't really understand why some of them behaved the way they did. It almost made some of them more caricatures rather than characters. Also, there were a number of spots that moved rather sluggishly that seemed to be due to the acting.

The 2009 version has better overall acting, and you have a much stronger understanding and depth of the entire story. Overall, okay but I'd go with the 2009 version instead.",1396742400,2,580,4.742574257425742

Yes, it's a story of elitism and snobbery and gossip and a social class system, but it's also a story about friendship, kindness, generosity, redemption, forgiveness, growing up, and true love.  (And the ending is wonderful!)  If you're able to look past the aristocratic English behavior and focus on the humanity, you'll love this movie too.",1394841600,,562,5.010752688172043

864502,4,6304383827,"Jane Austen's ""Emma"" is her one book that I hate to read because Emma is such a dated combination of sweetness and arrogant aristocratic busybody, and Mr. Knightley is so very instructive. I don't like the idea of them, after their inevitable marriage, being in the situation where Emma is a cute gossip and Mr. Knightley is overbearingly wise at her. That's creepy.

The movie solves that by making Emma spunky and Mr. Knightley very, very hot. He embodies what the Tiger Mom people say makes a perfect culture - guilt, self-control, and the sense of being superior to others. Plus, he's very hot.

I watched this along with ""Clueless"" which is ""Emma"" set in Beverly Hills. I will watch this one again, and not ""Clueless.""",1392076800,,723,4.73015873015873

Other than that I had a hard time keeping track of the characters. That may be due to the formality of the way they address one another.  I suspect that is also a throwback to the book.

864670,2,6304383827,"I prefer for reviewers to do stand alone reviews of products. When a movie is done multiple times and is based on a famous book, it can be hard to do that. That said, this is the WORST presentation of Emma I have ever seen. It only vaguely resembles Austen's book. It doesn't have the feel of any British period romance either. It's truly an American creation. That doesn't make it bad. It just makes it something other than Emma.

While there are many capable actors in this film, it is horribly miscast. Walker's strength is her fire. Why cast her as a wallflower? Paltrow does not work as an English innocent. I love Collette, but she just comes across as a cartoon in this movie. Bad direction? The only standout is Jeremy Northam who is just lovely.

The music is also awful. It encourages the cartoony feel.

There is ZERO chemistry between Paltrow and Northam. It doesn't feel romantic at all. It feels gossipy and vacuous, which is not like Jane Austen at all. Emma isn't likable. Frank Churchill is a scoundrel. Everyone lacks the depth that is displayed in the novel and other film adaptations. In short, it is lacking in all the things that make the book interesting.

The reviews say that this is a funny movie. It's not the least bit funny. All in all this is just the worst Emma ever. Skip it.",1390003200,,1307,4.4789915966386555

864821,5,6304383827,"I was first introduced to Jane Austen when my college roommate, an English major, announced it was 'the perfect novel'. When I finally read EMMA after college, the book puzzled me. Nothing seems to happen but conversation, picnics, the occasional dance and more conversation. Austen's works has none of the drama of JANE EYRE, for example. After reading more of Austen's works, I realized that was the lifestyle for upper society, and that is interesting in itself. So, the enjoyment of EMMA is in its subtleties.

In this story you have something unusual for the time: Emma, a heroine who doesn't have to marry. She already runs a household for her widowed father and has the means to not work as a governess. Meals are cooked, the fires are made and the door is answered by invisible others. As a bright, outgoing, confident young woman, Emma is itching for something to do. She likes managing things, she thinks she is intuitive about people. She will manage marriages she decides, something she's good at she thinks, even though she isn't interested in marriage for herself. She's never been in love, and wonders if she could fall for someone.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays Emma as a mischievous, light creature who is having great fun, and not serious enough to fall in love herself.

As Emma tries to manage the affairs of others' hearts, her plans often go awry which perhaps is Austen's point. The heart cannot be ruled by the head, even Emma's. Although her head told her she would never marry and couldn't fall in love, her head is wrong. As usual in Austen's novels, there are ancillary characters who add humor and zest to the scenes.  The scenes in this movie are exquisite - they look like pages out of VICTORIA magazine if it were titled REGENCY instead.  It's worth watching this movie for the aesthetics alone, The actors and plot are an added bonus.

The story of EMMA doesn't have the romantic tension of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as Emma is clueless to Knightley's feelings, and doesn't seem to know she has any of her own for much of the story. But you admire her independence and willingness to not be conventional. It is originally plotted, and a delight for Austen lovers.  It's a light-hearted romp with a gorgeous backdrop.",1388707200,,2236,4.732647814910026

However there are two great scenes in the movie, and some very funny scenes, if you like that kind of humor.

The quality of the Blu-Ray is poor. There are film artifacts, and thus the resolution does not seem high. I don't know if this is due to the film itself or the transfer to Blu-Ray.

Of the shorter Emma versions, we still prefer the the Kate Beckinsale version overall. The longer BBC Miniseries is also very good and mirrors the book quite well. In this version the casting of Harriet Smith seems too old and not pretty enough to see how Emma could think that Mr. Elton would prefer her. However, Mrs. Elton is quite a lot more charming in this movie than the one in the Kate Beckinsale version. Overall, liked it and will watch it again.",1383264000,,616,4.460176991150442

864999,3,6304383827,"The 1996 movie-rendition of Jane Austen's 1815 novel ""Emma"" was directed by Douglas McGrath who initially wanted to give the film a modernized setting and storyline.  When the movie ""Clueless"" was announced, plans for updating ""Emma"" quickly dissolved.  In proper Austen fashion, the story depicts the importance of marriage to a woman's status during the early 19th century.  Other than a script that enhances the comedic tension between George and Emma, McGarth was careful to keep the film as close to Austen's original plot as possible.  In the interest of the benevolent film heroine, it has also been noted that movie-Emma undergoes a lesser self-revelation than the Emma Austen portrayed. I enjoyed watching this movie and I think there is a lot to appreciate about some of the film's finer points:  costumes, direction, scenery, etc.  Unfortunately, the storyline gets overshadowed by the ""Clueless"" rendition, which adds extra humor and a novel spin on Austen's original book.

Starring roles include:  Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma Woodhouse, Denys Hawthorne as Mr. Woodhouse, Jeremy Northam as George Knightley, Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill, Toni Collette as Harriet Smith, Alan Cumming as Rev. Elton, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton, Phyllida Law as Mrs. Bates, Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates, Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax, and Greta Scacchi as Anne Taylor, to name a few.

SUMMARY:  Young Emma Woodhouse fancies herself quite the matchmaker when Miss Taylor, Emma's former governess, is wed to Mr. Weston.  Mr. Woodhouse and George Knightley see things differently, and now fear the mis-matchmaking monster has her eyes set on Reverend Elton and Harriet Smith--a pair highly distanced in the opinion of society-types.  Despite Harriet being ""low class,"" she and Emma grow fond of one another.  Emma is oblivious to both the chemistry between Harriet and Robert Martin, and the affections bestowed on her by Mr. Elton.

After a failed match between Mr. Elton and Harriet, Emma is determined to find a man for Harriet, even if it is Frank Churchill, a love interest of her own.  To Emma's dismay, Frank is in love with another. Harriet begins to desire George Knightley due to his polite, gentlemanly nature; Emma's ignorance becomes less blissful, causing her to act shamefully toward another woman, the humble Miss Bates.  George becomes infuriated with Emma's recent actions, creating a rift between the two just in time for Emma to realize her own feelings for George.

To make matters worse, Emma and Harriet are no longer speaking, a result of their mutual attraction to Mr. Knightley.  The movie comes to a climax when George and Emma are reunited in a meadow; they confess their love for one another and become engaged--an occurrence that fuels the fire between Emma and Harriet.  Emma realizes the errors of her meddling and reconciles with Harriet, who has found her own happiness with Robert Martin.",1382918400,10,2917,5.141949152542373

Pride and Prejudice, as a book and as several versions of film presentations, however, is an exception that I enjoy very much. Though I've tried to appreciate Austen, I've come to the realization that, on screen or on paper, and with the P&P exception, I find Austen's characters to be generally irritating and her stories to be hours...and... hours... of tedium. Okay, with that out of the way, re. the Emma DVD: I liked the filmography, directing, the stage settings, gorgeous colors, the locale and the moments of subtle and obvious humor, which I thought were portrayed well through acting and direction. Gwyneth Paltrow and much of the supporting cast, did fine acting jobs, in my estimation.

865467,4,6304383827,"As a definite Jane Austin fan and owning most of her filmed adaptions also, I must admit that I did find it a little hard to get into the Gwyneth Paltrow English accent. Not being American myself and having lived in the UK for 7 years and having a very strong English accent when I arrived to the US, I probably have more of an ear for it though. After getting over it though after the first 20 minutes or so, I definitely found myself drawn into the story and the characters and reacting just as though I was reading the book. It is a great story and a nice little adaption. The only ones I generally find are better are the authentic BBC ones.",1376611200,,645,4.168

And casting Toni Collette as Harriet Smith was just... wrong.

The acting was mediocre though Jeremy Northam does make a good Mr. Knightley. If you want to watch a really good reproduction of Emma check out the 2009 BBC one with Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller. It's pretty much superior in every way. The one thing I will say for this version is that it did have some pretty funny lines in it but I just found that it made the whole movie seem less serious and more silly. And not in a good way.

I liked all of them, but my favorite is the BBC version.  Gwyneth Paltrow was convincing enough as Emma, and her relationship with her insipid father was well portrayed.  Jeremy Northam was fine (and handsome) as Mr. Knightley but there was too little shown of the relationship between Knightley and Emma.

I am not a purist, so if the movie version doesn't follow the book to the letter, I'm okay with it as long as the main points are shown, the relationships are fleshed out and most of the dialogue is true to the author's written word.  This version disappointed in showing the intimacy of the Knightley relationship with the Woodhouse family.  But at  only two hours it's going to be disappointing in one respect or another.  Too much Harriet Smith, not enough Knightley, or the relationship between Churchill and Emma too.

So, in comparison to the book, this movie is somewhat accurate, but as in all movies they did add events that never happened, and big reveals weren't as big because they had the characters give hints of secret affections and feelings in this movie. The movie is pretty slow, but I guess the book was a little too. As most readers are, I am a little biased in character portrayal also and I feel that at least half of the characters, particularly Harriet Smith, were not portrayed correctly. But then again, I am biased on that certain point. Overall, the chemistry between the characters was well portrayed and I believe that it was a pretty good movie; not bad for the rental price I paid, it was less than seeing it in a theater or something.",1368316800,2,815,4.333333333333333
866003,5,6304383827,"I had always hesitated in watching this movie.  As an avid Jane Austen fan, I was somewhat distracted by the DVD cover depicting Emma as Cupid.  Once you get to the movie you have a much different experience.  I enjoyed the settings, the interpretation of the story.  Gwyneth Paltrow did a marvelous Emma, socially intelligent but at times humanly ignorant.  Mr. Knightly was my favorite as always.  I enjoyed this look at him and found it comparable to the movie with Kate Beckinsale as Emma.  Each movie has its own look and charms.
I think it is wise to govern your feelings about any of the movies as they are products of the director's mind.  The best Emma ""movie"" is to grab a cup of coffee and curl up with the book and let your imagination take the lead.  We should not expect that another's interpretation should match the intention and work of Jane Austen as much as our own or our own viewpoints.  She had many messages in all of her work but Emma really is delightful in every view.
If you just compare the movies of Emma with each other you only have a small slice of Jane Austen's world.  You compare the characters the way it ought to be....with the others.  As Maryann said in ""Sense and Sensibility"", "" I compare my conduct with yours (Elinor), the way it ought to be.""  And for me, the comments will be thus.

The lines in this version are actually better than the BBC version with Romola Garand(sp),(more pointedly taken rom the book)  but the thoroughness of craft-attention to the depth of the novel- is, of course lacking, in the Paltrow version.  There is a good deal of humor and use of cinematography to work the humor in this Paltrow version and though Mr. Knightley is apparently shorter (at least he appears that way in the profession of love seen) he is very pleasant to look upon.

866008,3,6304383827,"Emma is one of the most challenging movies to review, because of how average it is. No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it.

I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focusses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fianc. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet.

It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath.

Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind.  Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected language... Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.",1365897600,,1692,4.686868686868687

The climatic love scene where Jeremy finally gets around to asking Gweneth (Emma), to marry him is in my view, was innocently intimate -- HOW LOVE SHOULD BE, always but today has been twisted into sheer animal sensuality.

866123,2,6304383827,"This movie is just that- mediocre.

The cast is passable, nothing extraordinary. Gwenyth Paltrow just doesn't have the personality right on Emma; She seems a sophisticated, rich snob with nothing to do but meddle with other peoples' affairs. She has no playfulness, and Paltrow alternates between being either too happy or too depressed, and always very selfish. I might add that her hairstlyes were awful, they made her look almost bald! Mr. Knightley is okay, but Jeremy Northam hasn't got the temperment or stature to play the character; it seems very difficult for him to act angery, it's almost laughable when he tries to reprimand Emma after insulting Ms. Bates. (and did anyone notice that Emma was almost taller then Knightley?) Frank Churchill has the goofiest hair style, whose idea was it to give him long hair?!? Ridiculous. He appears like a complete idiot, are we seriously suposed to believe Emma could ever fall for him?! Completely without charm, just dumb. Jane Fairfax is almost nonexistent, whatever you do see of her isn't pretty. Ms. Bates seems slightly insane. Harriet's interesting... a little too silly. None of the minor characters are worth mentioning.

The sets seem cheap, the costumes are nothing special, the script is decent and stays relatively close to that in the book, but is not done justice by the actors.

In my opinion, if you want a film that is closer to the book and has great acting, buy the A&E adaptation with Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. It is strong where this is weak, and is nearly perfect. Watching this ""thing"" sure makes me appreciate the A&E version.",1363910400,,1609,4.908088235294118

The casting is perfectly inspired and I found every nuance and inflection of Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly true to a man falling dangerously in love. Thoroughly worth the price of admission is the scene between Harriet (Toni Collette) and Emma where Harriet's declaration reveals her as a rival. Toni Collette's innocent (or not so innocent) words fall like daggers and Gwyneth Paltrow masterfully delivers the complexities of Emma's emotional response showing a young woman who finally knows her own heart.

However, while it catches the essential plot of Emma, it fails to catch the flavor and the nuances of the story and is a trifle disappointing.

866484,3,6304383827,"I saw this movie when it first came to theaters and loved it. I thought it was very well done and Paltrow did a fantastic job. Northam was a perfect Knightley to me back in the day and I watched this again and again. Once I read the novel I realized how much was left out but as an adaptation I believed they did the best they could. Fast forward to present day and I just watched this again with a bit of a different reaction. I didn't realize before how inappropriate some of the characters behaved. Knightley, gentlemanly as he was alleged to be, would not be slouching in chairs and roughly grabbing Emma (as Northam does in the scene where Knightley scolds Emma for being rude to Bates). Was a gentleman (even a brotherly one) allowed to physically handle a lady while yelling at her? That scene just completely sat wrong with me. Much of this movie is a bit too cutesy, too modern, although dressed up in period pieces and making an attempt at truncated Austen dialogue. It doesn't really fit, in the end. For the proper behavior, watch A&E's Pride and Prejudice. That one will definitely transport you to the Regency era. It's a perfect Austen adaptation. As for this version of Emma, it isn't horrible, although it is not exactly faithful to the novel. It's fluffy, Paltrow comes off as a bit dim and cutesy and Emma is supposed to be extremely clever, just misguided. Paltrow wrinkles her brow in adorable confusion but that's about the extent of the depth she gives her Emma. And Toni Collette comes off even worse, though she has Harriet's sweetness down. I didn't sense any growth in Emma because the whole Fairfax storyline is barely there and I recall being completely confused by it the first time I saw this. It's far more of a plot point in the book and seemed crammed into this movie at the last moment. What's most distracting is the modern way the characters interact, with the slouching and the touching and how about the last kiss after the proposal? Yikes. If you're the type who doesn't so much care about faithfulness to the time period, as I was as a twenty-something) you won't mind it, but if you notice these things, it will distract you. I also notice many recommendations for the Kate Beckinsale version, which I also saw but only once a long time ago. I was biased towards this version and absolutely hated it.....I didn't like Mark Strong as Knightley at all and considered it a punishment for Emma to end up with him.

I do commend Gweneth Paltrow's efforts at playing a role for a story she's probably never heard of and an era never she's bothered to act for. I appreciate her efforts, but the older versions have outdone them.

The best acting is by the character that plays Harriet Smith, sorry can't remember her name, but she was welcomed respite from the lackluster Paltrow. The interior sets were horrid! What was being covered up with all those hanging textiles? And why were there so many scenes out on the lawns? Too cheap to rent the interiors? Can't believe this earned two academy award nominations for anything except maybe the horses. I must say the equestrian aspect of this production was well done.

Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is moving in her depiction of a young woman's romantic hopes and designs--for herself as well as for her friends.  From my own recollections of high school I recognize the efforts of Paltrow's Emma as similar to those of high school girls in my own day.  The lengths that a girl might go to in order to set up her friends with various boys was something that I found truly astonishing in my own high school days forty years ago.  Indeed, a college friend once told me that he ended up with his fiance due to a decision made between her and her girlfriend regarding which of the two of them would go after him!",1313280000,,955,4.342696629213483

Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedy...even if it's not the best adaptation.

I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust).

This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.",1304294400,,952,4.627218934911243

It was clear watching this film that none of the characters, directors, producers, or anyone involved in the making of this film actually understood the book. Emma is portrayed only as a pretty English woman who has social class and knows it. But the character of Emma is so much more complex. Now, granted, Emma is probably the hardest Jane Austen book to film, because Emma IS so complex, and it's hard to get on-screen, but Paltrow and McGrath did an extremely poor job. When I watched this movie, I had no desire to ever look at the book again.
If you want to see a fantastic adaptation of Emma, watch the 2009 BBC adaptation. Not only is it much better than the Paltrow/McGrath, it is perfect. You will watch the adaptation, and want to start reading the book that night.",1284508800,3,877,4.419753086419753

866791,4,6304383827,"This was a difficult film to evaluate.  For one thing, Emma was not my favorite of Jane Austin's novels, that pride of place having been taken by Pride and Prejudice.  The choice of Gywneth Paltrow for the heroine Emma was certainly a good one.  She is able to put across the self-centered but well intentioned young Emma better than anyone might.  Anyone less light of touch might have made the girl patently unlikeable.  In fact the entire cast did a fine job.  Probably the character I most enjoyed was that of Mrs. Elton, the Vicar's wife from Bath, played by Juliet Stevenson.  Her desire to appear ""cultured"" and her attempts to make herself one of the local elite were delightful.

The real subject of the work is that of illegitimacy.  Emma attempts to place a girlhood friend, Harriet Smith, into a prime marriage, ignoring society's taboos and prejudices on the subject, which her friend Mr. Knightly tries to point out to her.  Ultimately Emma must accept that society will not change to suit her desires, that encouraging Ms Smith to aspirations beyond her expectations is hurting her and their friendship, and Mr. Knightly finally acknowledges that even though Ms Smith is illegitimate, she is also a fine young person.",1282780800,,1232,4.851674641148326
866792,1,6304383827,"This film adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel Emma is, in my opinion, the worst of the four. The filmmakers used a very exaggerated, hyperactive Hollywood style which really undermines Austen storytelling. It leaves the viewer every moment expecting something more 'exciting' to happen but of course because it's an Austen story, the excitement is not in large or epic events but in the small every day interactions between characters and in the things that happen that really can only affect themselves and not society at large. The result of this dichotomy was that it moved at a snail's pace when it tried to 'act' as if it were a racehorse, and I and my four friends who watched it, none of whom were familiar with Austen like I am, were all bored to the point of starting to FALL ASLEEP!

All of the actors are excellent, particularly Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates, and Alan Cummings as Mr. Elton.

My only quibble is really that Jeremy Northam and Gwyneth  Paltrow were both *too* gorgeous and sophisticated-looking: it seemed ridiculous that a man like that would not already have been married, and certainly older members of their circle would have paired these two off long before !

Now, having grown in knowledge and sophistication, I watched it again for the first time since then, and the best I can say is this:

It is a nice introduction to Austen-on-film for a young romantic, a good bridge, perhaps, from ""Clueless"" to the BBC, but it mostly suffices as a Regency-period fashion show for Ms. Paltrow, in all her swan-necked posings.  Her acting, however, is inferior to that of her co-stars as well as to the source material, but for that I blame the direction more than the actress.

What I find especially baffling is that, having previously read all of Austen, I liked this film adaptation at all, but I suppose I was caught up in the Hollywood glamour and likewise all too happy to uncritically embrace anything remotely Austen.

I loved the humor - it is a wonderful ""girl"" movie with laughs and tears and of course beautiful language with nothing objectionable...It is the kind of movie that gives you the escape that you need into a world that is believable on some level but not real enough to be depressing.

Viewed on a 16/9 tv set to the required 4/3 format, the picture only fills the center 40-percent of the screen, which is too small to enjoy even on my 52-inch Samsung. As if all this wasn't bad enough, the quality of the transfer is very poor. The image is so soft that you keep squinting at it in an attempt to sharpen it up.

""Emma"" was a highly regarded movie when released. I can't understand why the studio would distribute such a poor version of it. It would have cost no more to released it as an anamorphic DVD, such as waas done for ""Sense and Sensability"", which produces near blu-ray quality images.",1254441600,5,1127,4.146118721461187

I won't take on that argument, but I will say that I found this version of Emma to be a pretty good movie that you may enjoy if you're looking for some light entertainment. If you like Gwyneth Paltrow, then you'll probably like the movie. Young Gwyneth is pleasant to watch, and she does a good job of playing a character who is a spoiled busybody but still remains innocent and likeable. I like Jeremy Northam as Knightley. The age difference in the two characters creeps me out a bit, even in the book, but here Knightley and Emma have a brother/sister sort of relationship grown from being neighbors all of her life, and it seems to naturally develop into love. The two actors' chemistry makes it sweet and charming. I have to go out on a limb here and say I was very bothered by, of all things, Ewan McGregor's hair in this movie! He plays Frank Churchhill, a handsome charmer, but his bizarre wedge haircut bugged me every time he came onscreen. So I had trouble buying him as any kind of competition for handsome ole Knightley. The rest of the cast was very good, the movie has a nice look to it, and I find it to be sweet and entertaining. My husband, on the other hand, normally likes Austen movies but says this one bores him to tears. So here in our house you've got one vote for sweet and pleasant and one vote for boring and dull.

I don't really understand why Jane Austen is so popular when each and every one of her stories seems to be the same story with different names.

Okay, I've said it, and I'm sure the hate mail will come pouring in now, but it had to be said.  I know that some of you have seen this too, I mean, you'd really have to be blinded by your love of the period goddess to have not see it.  Yes, her stories are touching and for any lover of the genre, films like `Sense and Sensibility' and `Pride and Prejudice' are really top notch entertainment (I love both those films by the way, so don't take this little revelation as an `I hate Jane Austen' tirade, for it is not), but one must realize that there is really little difference between the two stories.

Girl loves boy who loves another girl.  A different boy loves the first girl but she is put off by him.  When the boy the girl loves finally loves her she realizes that she loves the boy she was put off by but he is now in love with another girl.  Eventually they realize they are meant for one another and the ending is, of course, very happy.

That said, `Emma' is sweet and charming in its own right, but it pales in comparison to the previous Austen juggernauts (I love Paltrow, but she is no Winslet and she can't manage to muster up the charm Knightley brought to her performance).  The plot, while familiar, is not really the issue here.  I think the biggest issue is Paltrow.  Now I will not say that it was her accent, because it wasn't.  I actually thought she pulled that off quite nicely.  The problem was that she wasn't very entertaining.  I found her rather boorish and uninteresting.  I expected her to be emotionally investing (as was the always stellar Winslet) or perky and excitable (as was Knightley).  Instead she was just barely there and really was overshadowed by nearly everyone else on the screen.

It was exciting to see Toni Collette is a softer role.  She is truly a wonderful actress and played her part beautifully.

In the end I just can't see a real reason to entertain this film unless you are a devoted Jane Austen fan.  If you are merely a fan of the genre then select some of her other work (or some other work period) since this is not the cream of the crop.  Its familiarity is only the underlying foundation for my displeasure.  It is the lack of spontaneity and the lack of overall excitement that makes `Emma' a dull girl.",1222214400,2,2650,4.357142857142857

Of course there are a few things to consider upon watching this film;

1. If you prefer a film that maintains the basis of the author's story but strays in order to entertain the majority of a movie-going audience, or a more precise visualization of the text in it's original and actual entirety.

2. If you can enjoy a less serious approach to the tale.

Not to mention slight character changes and so on and so forth. (You almost feel like your watching the spawn of Emma, a.k.a. 1995's Clueless.)

With that said, in this film Emma has a brilliant joy and although I find myself frustrated with her for being so blind in her matchmaking decisions one still feels for her and sympathizes with her pains.

This was a very funny ""Emma"".  Emma can't be done in a somber, serious way - Emma is just not that sort.  The movie captures Emma in both her earnestness as well as her matchmaking silliness.  Paltrow is a lot of fun to watch, and how she fancies herself in love with Churchill is amusing to watch.

I'll also admit a weakness for actors Greta Sacchi, Alan Cumming, and Jeremy Northam.  They're just a joy to watch.

Weaknesses: lack of Austen.  It's a looser adaptation, and it misses characterization as it adds other scenes.  Davies' version does a better job, packing its shorter version with more character development (e.g. for Knightley).  I also found Olivia Williams' Jane Fairfax more memorable than Polly Walker's, although Walker's wasn't bad.

Super stink: Frank Churchill.  What the heck?  Since when was Frank Churchill a floofy-haired froufrou?  Moreover, while I can usually disassociate actors from their previous roles, I kept waiting for Churchill to pull out his light saber and cut Emma out of the big puddle.

867240,4,6304383827,"It's been said that for two weeks every year, the countryside of England is the closest Earth comes to Eden.

That is the England of Douglas McGrath's 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, ""Emma.""  Starring Gwyneth Paltrow (pre-""Shakespeare in Love"") and a host of British acting aces, ""Emma"" is a pure feel-good romp through England's strict Victorian manners.

Emma Wodehouse is living her life by arranging the lives of others, content to try to arrange the marriages of the Harriet Smiths (Toni Collette) of the world to the Mr. Eltons (Alan Cumming).  Romantic misadventures abound, particularly when the dashing Mr. Churchill (Ewan MacGregor) shows up and the equally dashing Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Notham) begins to look like something a bit more than a best friend.

McGrath keeps all this romantic folderol clipping along at a blithe, cheery pace, complete with pitch-perfect soundtrack and gorgeous camera work.  But perhaps the most moving scene is where Emma bares her claws and tears into a ridiculously chatty friend (played perfectly by Sophie Thompson) only to have Mr. Knightley call Emma out.  This is the prototypically Jane Austen scene - the exactly right words say so much with subtext even though they aren't that damning at first light.  To say the actors handle this scene well is an understatement.

Perhaps I should give this movie five stars.  It's tough to do so - both the Jane Austen filmography and the spate of terrific English romantic comedies are crowded fields.  While I can't say ""Emma"" is the best film I've seen, it is surely one of the most enjoyable, smile-inducing flicks I've watched in a long time.

867321,5,6304383827,"This film has a dream cast with Gwyneth Paltrow playing the elegant rich girl Emma, getting into trouble with her foolish over-romantic meddling in the affairs of others. Jeremy Northam is reserved, wise, and handsome as Mr. Knightly, Emma's sister's brother-in-law who is also a neighbor of the Woodhouse family. Toni Collette plays a big-boned Harriet Smith, the village maid that eventually finds the right man. Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax and Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill play the secret lovers who eventually marry when the young Mr. Churchill inherits enough funds to marry a poor but beautiful, reserved, and talented governess. Greta Scacchi plays Frank Churchill's mother, Mrs. Weston and hats off to Sophie Thompson who plays the silly chatterbox Miss Bates. All the actors are superb but it is actually Toni Collette who steals every scene playing the overly impressionable Miss Harriett Smith.

Jane Austen's Emma has always been a favorite of mine.  It is as close to comedy as any of Austen's work. It is basically about a rich beautiful witty and immature young woman who begins to grow up after her endless schemes back-fire and she almost misses a man who adores her. This differs from Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility where the women are not rich and thus marriage to a well situated male makes all the difference in the world in regard to life's trajectory. Late 18th century women in England had to rely on marriage as the prime determination of their social class and fiscal stability. Thus the play between men and women has an edge of economic competition in Austen's more mature works than is evident in Emma. Emma is about maturity and developing character whereas Elizabeth Barrett in Pride and Prejudice already has a high level of character and maturity even as the story begins. Even though Harold Bloom, the literary critic, selects Emma as the best of Austen's work, I find I disagree. This film is beautiful and graceful and funny, exactly as Emma should be produced. However it is Pride and Prejudice which is the masterpiece. This however does not distract from this charming and well produced interpretation of Austen's Emma.",1206921600,2,2178,4.980769230769231

867328,4,6304383827,"1996's ""Emma"" is a dramatization of one of Jane Austen's last novels, featured young Gwyneth Paltrow in the leading role.  ""Emma"" as directed by Douglas McGrath is pure romantic comedy.

Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow)is the youngest daughter of an aging aristocrat (Denys Hawthorne) and a benign but inept matchmaker for her friends.  Her particular target is her friend Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), whom she talks out of accepting the offer of an honest farmer in favor of pursuing the more sophisticated young cleryman Mr. Elher (Alan Cummings).  This scheme falls to pieces when it becomes embarassingly clear that Mr. Elher is more interested in Emma.  Emma continues to search for an eligible young man for Harriet, becoming distracted along the way by her feelings for the roguish Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor), who has caught the eye of several local ladies.

Emma's inept matchmaking culminates in her thoughtless humiliation of the chatty but harmless spinster Miss Bates at a picnic.  She is very properly upbraided for bad form by her very patient good friend Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam in a movie-stealing performance).  Emma realizes almost too late that her own interest may lie with Mr. Knightley. Their walk in the woods may be the most priceless scene in the movie, as Mr. Knightley tries to set the scene for a proposal of marriage while Emma tries to head off what she fears will be an end to their friendship.

""Emma"" is good fun but leaves something to be desired as an Austen adaptation.  The leading character has been bleached of her imperfections; she is charming and likeable throughout the movie with the single exception of the incident at the picnic.  She pays no particular price for her interference in other people's lives; the painful personal growth we expect in a Jane Austen character that will lead to the right mate has been almost airbrushed out of the story.

I am happy to say that Gwyneth Paltrow embodies the title character of Emma charmingly.  The upperclass matchmaker [and mischiefmaker] proceeds to set people up, shake up naysayers around her and has her share of misadventures.  This film will make you smile and is very cleverly executed, and the supporting cast (James Cosmo, Greta Scacchi, and Alan Cumming, among others) are strong and play off of Paltrow's spritely and fiesty Emma delightfully.

The story may vary greatly from what the book was intended to express but I liked the premise of the movie. I finally read the book and was greatly surprised at the differences in it and the movie.  The movie is the winner by far in my opinion. However, it doesn't matter. The movie is what the the producer had the right to make it ...a comedy instead of a story about a busybody who schemed to wreak havoc at every turn.

The poor little rich girl has nothing left to do after her governess gets married but to try to ""repeat"" her success at match making by hooking up the parson with a local girl. The whole thing backfires miserably, and Emma nearly loses her true and best friend in the process.

There is so much in human nature and the nature of females during this time period that are still characteristic of women today. (Even though we have come a long way) I think the screenplay writers thought that it would be better to express the more positive sides of busy bodies given from the male perspective. Then one could understand the reasons why Mr. Knightly came to adore Emma.

867563,4,6304383827,"I have to say I went into this movie thinking that it was a typical Hollywood movie based only loosely on the original book. Emma is a favorite book of mine, and so I was expecting to not enjoy the movie at all. The picture of Paltrow shooting the arrow on the cover added to my trepidation.

Instead, I found a movie that was not straight out of the book, but was still much better than I expected. Mr. Knightly was the dashing gentlemen required. The relationship between he and Emma was less subtle than in the book. In the book, at least the first time you read it, there is a delightful suspense in the Harriet/Emma/Elton triangle as well as between Churchill/Emma/Knightly. In the movie there is none. Some of the other characters had similar double-edged qualities. The Mrs. Elton, for example, brought out her silliness - all the ""Mr. E""'s, ""Knightly""s, and ""Maple Grove""s - but not her vindictiveness.

Another problem is that I did not see Emma's development as I remember through the book. Although the movie does have a very nice scene of Emma taking care of the poor, it seems to me that it focuses too much on her matchmaking aspects. One of my favorite continuing themes of the book is Emma's self-examinations when her various ways of controlling people blow up in here face, and I didn't get that so much from the film. I thus come away feeling that the cover shot was aptly (if a bit falsely) chosen.

All in all, a good adaptation of the book, surprisingly good for a big-star Hollywood effort.",1178064000,3,1513,4.555147058823529

867610,5,6304383827,"Almost universally, I find novels to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow.

I was quite enamoured with this highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to seek out the book.  Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to ""know"" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in delightful details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!  Jeremy Northam was outstanding in this role!

I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been ""turned-on"" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma.",1170979200,9,1702,4.77891156462585

With that rant aside, let me say that i have read the book, I have seen the Beckinsale version and I still consider this  my favorite of the two.  The reason is a matter of humor.  While the Beckinsale version is very 'faithful', this has a wonderful genteel humor which I think Austen herself would appreciate.",1170633600,3,530,4.46875

That being said, this movie on its own is a joy to watch.  The cast was believable in their relationships with one another.  The scenes were all filmed in Dorset and London I believe.  The humor is well timed, the actors do not overact, and the style of language is much more proper than what we speak today, as should be expected from the upper class of the 19th century.

Yes, I have both Emmas but this one had more to offer in the cast. Ewan McGregor has a wonderful singing voice and I was overjoyed to hear him sing in the duet with Emma.

867670,3,6304383827,"To my mind, ""Emma"" is the greatest of Jane Austen's novels, but the only one that doesn't seem to work very well either in TV versions or here on the big screen. In this peculiarity, the book is surely comparable to Fitzgerald's ""Great Gatsby,"" another masterpiece hobbled just as badly when it comes to film adaptation. The problem lies, I suspect, in the great prominence given in each of these novels to the narrator or internal monologist. In the respective film versions, the enriching reflective capacities provided by such characters necessarily disappear.  In the case of ""Emma,"" the absence of both the rich ironies and self-delusions found in the heroine's stream-of-consciousness-style monologues robs the film of a great portion of Austen's wit and most of her focus on the heroine's growth in personhood. What we're left with instead is just a light hearted, externally-centered romance, a visually beautiful period comedy with attractive sets, elegant costumes and pretty faces.  If Jane Austen had been what she was once misread as being, merely a gentle-hearted chronicler of Regency romance, this might be well and good. But since in fact she's a much wittier and more profound novelist, any appreciator of ""Emma"" is likely to feel keen disappointment in this screen adaptation.",1166572800,,1295,5.1913875598086126

To my astonishment I actually like this version better! I like Austen's movie adaptations but have never read her books (except Sense and Sensibility in high school, which I don't remember). Some may call it lazy or unimaginative, but I prefer movies, though I know there would never be adaptations without the books but there it is. I do not know exactly what it was about this version that I like better; maybe that it seemed brighter and the characters were more fitting to their parts and there was more time to get to know each character better since this version is longer. The dialogue was much easier to understand (more modern that truely period based, but still fitting) and I am NOT a Paltrow fan but she was perfect in this role as Emma.

Gwyneth Paltrow does well with the material (such as it is), and she works well with Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly).  I especially enjoyed Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Elton and the real-life mother and daughter team of Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson as Mrs. and Miss Bates.

But I must say that I am very pleased with this adaptation of the book.  I bought this movie on a whim last week---really knowing nothing about it.  I really enjoyed the enitre movie from start to finish and have watched it several times since.

I think it is a ""cute"" story and Paltrow/Northam play a very likeable Emma/Knightley. Seeing this movie has motivated me to reread the book and although I'm not yet halfway through the book, I do find that quite a bit of the dialogue from the book is found in the movie and in general it follows the book pretty well.

This is an easy to watch, feel good, romantic movie.  I liked all the characters, esp Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates.  Certainly a great movie to watch on dreary days to lift your spirits.  I would highly recommend this to any romantics at heart.",1141948800,12,937,4.406976744186046

PLUS, she is a meddlesome, sharp-tongued busybody who tries to control everyone around her, regardless of their own preferences. When finally called to task by her best friend, Mr. Knightly, a neighbor who routinely visits her father, she is forced to confront her worst attributes, admit to them and start to mend her fences.

867768,3,6304383827,"This version of Emma was great, until BBC's version came out a year later.  Unfortunately, BBC's Emma didn't get as much recognition because the release date was so close to that of the hollywood version.  Kate Beckinsale is much more convincing as Emma.  Paltrow seemed too stiff and awkward in the role (those who are bigger fans of Paltrow than myself may disagree) but I believe that anyone who has seen both versions will find that Beckinsale is a natural in this role and a pleasure to watch.  I don't want to be too harsh on Gwyneth - but this is not the version you should see if you want a great Austen movie.

As an avid fan of classic period dramas, I have seen just about every movie and mini-series made.  BBC has always come out with wonderful period pieces - most notably Pride and Prejudice - and the 1997 movie is no exception.  I don't know quite how to describe it, but the pace and feel of the movies made by BBC seem to capture the essence of the period more so than those made in hollywood.

Kate Beckinsale's Emma is the one to get.  It is a delight to watch again and again.",1140652800,6,1098,4.29126213592233

867853,4,6304383827,"Although this version is often called ""too Hollywood-ized"" I absolutely love it.  Rich girl Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow) feels very unsecure about life when her nanny, and best friend, gets married and has to move away. Emma doesn't really now who to talk to about her problems with her love life. Instead she tries to be a matchmaker for her friend Harriet (Collette). She tries to get her together with the nice young reverend Elton (Cumming), but it turns out he was only interested in Emma! Problems ahead for everyone involved.  After a slow first half-hour, the story got started and I found that this was actually a funny, smart and beautiful tale.

During the last 20 minutes or so of the film, I had an ""Ah ha!"" moment when I realized that this movie was just like Clueless with Alicia Silverstone.  Is this better or worse than Clueless? It's difficult to decide. Interestingly, both lifestyles depicted seem just as distant from most people's - 1800 England and 1995 Beverly Hills. In both films, the dialogue sounds equally unfamiliar. Both are hilarious and charming, though Emma is the more subtle and touching film. Overall, I think Emma wins out.",1139702400,3,1158,4.833333333333333
867854,5,6304383827,"I rate ""Emma"" 5-stars. Gwyneth Paltrow plays an upper=class member from the Gentry (as opposed to the nobility), who plays matchmaker to another young lady, who is considered to be socially inferior to her, but overlooks this because she's not a snob, so she tries to help this young woman find a suitable suitor from the Gentry. Eventually, ""Emma"" ends up getting closer to one of her male friends and realizes that she has feelings for him and follows her heart.

It's a good movie for anyone, who is interested by the British class system and loves a romantic comedy.

867855,3,6304383827,"I have to say if there was ever and actress fit for a role it would be Gwynneth Paltrow. An actress so many love to hate, yet in reality a good actress.

Emma is one of those characters that has good intentions, and can be quite sweet but is maddening in her approach to things. Again somebody you'd love to hate.

My biggest gripe ould be that it focusses too much on Emma, not on the rest of the story, which is at least as fascinating. It really took away a ot of the pleasure, Knowing there are so many more layers that are not explored and it resulted in the 3 star grade though I did enjoy watching it

Toni Colette is a fantastic Harriet Smith, if a little old for the role. The Jane Fairfax parts are too short. The changing chemistry between her and Emma (partially guided by Mr Knightley) is much more interesting in the book.

mrs Elton (Juliet Stevenson) is fantastically over the top, as she is in the book.

All in all too much cramped in too little time, too much focus on Emma, which is a shame with such a fantastic cast of people",1136505600,2,1047,4.189054726368159
867856,3,6304383827,"The movie itself is lovely, lighthearted and happy, and has been reviewed in painstaking detail by other readers. I'd give it four or five stars, considering how much we enjoyed it. But I was very disappointed by the DVD edition. Not only does it come without any special features, it comes with no alternative soundtracks, and not even subtitles in other languages. Not all our friends/family understand English so well as to follow Jane Austen without subtitles - thus we cannot share this movie with them. It's as if the producers put as little effort as they could and just pushed this one out. There are no other versions I know of.

Perhaps we should have taken the hint from the blurb on the back  of the box, which does nothing else but compare the movie with ""the hit movie Clueless""? Yep. Clueless. It sorts of gives you an idea of the thought that was put in this DVD...",1135641600,2,881,4.534591194968553

As if the actors - though very good ones at that - couldn't wholly identify with the characters they played. Sometimes they just seemed to be telling their lines without their hearts being in it. There is one exception and that is the excellent Jeremy Northam. Although his Mr Knigthley is certainly not as charismatic as that of Mark Strong in the other version of Emma, he was great.

Toni Colette, though a very good actress, was really miscast as Harriet Smith and not just physically. She is a modern actress and couldn't fit into this period drama. The same is true for Ewan McGregor: a great actor, but not one for period drama, or at least not for regency drama, I fear.

The film is not strictly faithful to the plot, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, but it weakens the performance even further altogether. Still, if you do not have too high expectations, you may enjoy this film without further ado.",1131408000,6,1050,4.579787234042553
867858,4,6304383827,"I found this move fun to watch.  There are a few errors which I seem to get caught on as soon as I see them.  For one the actress that plays Jane Fairfax is crossing her legs at almost every opportunity.  Crossing your legs was considered vulgar and not at all ladylike.  She also lays back in whatever seat she is in.  She should have copied Gwyneth's example and sat errect. It was part of a young lady's training to always sit erect and ankles crossed with hands in your lap. This was an era where extreme manners and politeness were a part of your life, you could get cut in society if your manners were not the best.  It was more strict for unmarried ladies who always wanted to portray themselves in the best light always in order to maintain their social standing and catch a husband.  The Mrs. Weston, a former governess should have known better, but she also slouched throughout the movie.  I find myself also struck by the pasty look of Gwyneth's eyebrows.  They seem very painted in a way and most unnatural.  Gwyneth's performance was very good.  I cannot criticize her accent or acting, if only I could get over looking at her as Gwyneth!  My favorite characters in the whole movie are Miss Bates and Mrs. Bates.  They totally crack me up!  She is so totally believeable and you totally sympathize with her when Jane lashes out at her at the picnic.  I disagree with another's criticism of her saying she kept her voice too loud throughout the movie because if you lived with someone 24/7 who had very bad hearing, I can see where you would be used to speaking loudly. Which I don't find her doing at all. I found Jane's father a bit too robust to be a sickly gentleman.  The BBC version of Jane's father is perfect!  Once you watch that one, it's hard to see this version's father in that light.  Mrs. Elton steals the whole movie!  Her acting and character just push everyone else out of the way when she comes on scene.  Once I put all those things aside, I enjoyed watching the beautiful scenery and lovely dresses and hair that Emma wore.  Would I buy this movie again??  Yes, and since I have watched it 5 times already having only owned it a month or so, then I guess that means that I enjoy it quite a bit.

867860,1,6304383827,"Where to start?  If you are a fan of the book you will not like the many liberties the film has taken.  Many key scenes are changed or added to.  Many characters suffer changes either from the script or the actors who portray them.
For example, when Mr. Elton, Harriet and Emma are walking together and Emma stops to cut her bootlace and urges the others to go on because she wants them to be alone but when she see's a passing child she starts to walk with him and when they draw too close to Harriet and Mr. Elton she grabs on to the boy while he struggles to get away.  Can you imagine a lady of Emma's class holding on to a struggling little boy simply to allow two people to be alone?  Then there is Mrs. Bates who seems like a slow-witted woman who giggles at everything and has an I.Q. of 2 instead of a woman of good temperament who is a chatterbox. Harriet seems to have no brain at all and when told that Emma and Mr. Knightley are engaged she breaks down and sobs (you really only see Robert Martin two or three brief times at the beginning of the movie and then he is mostly forgotten until we find out that Harriet is going to marry him). Jane Fairfax seems to carry an expression of snobbiness more than reserve.  Frank Churchill (who is the only character with longer hair, which I don't understand), is introduced to the audience when he comes on horseback and finds Emma, alone, sitting on her carriage in a small pool of water with the wheel stuck.  As to Mr. Frank Churchill's character, very little is made of the triangle between him, Jane, and Emma.  The script was also changed so that it is now Frank who introduces the idea of Mr. Dixon having affection for Jane.  Also, Mr. Elton almost seems like a dog when talking to Emma. In one scene after he inquires after her father she thanks him for his thoughtfulness and he says, ""Thank you for thinking I am thoughtful."" and when Mr. Elton proposes to Emma he practically accosts her in the carriage. He doesn't seem to be able to keep his hands off her.
As for Emma herself, she seems purely cruel.  While walking down the street with Harriet, she spies Mrs. Bates coming and her and Harriet quickly dash under a tent and hide themselves with their umbrella's.  At Box Hill when she makes her comment about Mrs. Bates not being limited by saying three dumb things, she seems to think about it before she says it and when confronted by Mr. Knightley she defends herself at first.  Anyway, I could go on and on from the variations from the book.
I understand that when making a book into a movie certain changes must be made, however in this case, they were all unnecessary and this is proven by the remarkable A&E adaptation.

I rented both movies from the library to judge for myself and I could barely get through this version.  Hollywood changed too much for my taste. The A&E adaptation is certainly better cast and acted.  The right attention is given to all of the characters and indeed, the writers and actors of A&E's version seem to understand the characters and story better. It seems that the writers and director of this film changed many parts only to make the entire film a comedy they thought today's audience would enjoy.  Well, there is such a thing as trying too hard and this is the proof.

Therefore, I urge you all of you who are fans of the book, for your own sakes, not to even bother watching this out of curiosity.  Save yourself the time and get A&E's version with Kate Beckinsdale as Emma.  That adaptation is well worth it.",1126915200,23,3523,4.392307692307693

Toni Collette does a superb job on Harriet Smith.  A young girl with no known family.  I must also say a word to Knightley the hero of the story.  I have pictures all over my room of this movie.

I bought this movie and have seen it several times.

I do have a few gripes but they are minor (Ewan McGregor ""Frank Churchill"" hair (iky), Gwyneth Paltrow's occasional stiffness (she was too perfect and didn't seem to relax into her part all the time, although I still thought she did a good job), and some other minor things.

There is too much obvious comedy whereas I always think that the comedy in Austen does not come from 'funny' acting, but is derived from the characters and their dialogues.

I'll stick to the other Emma with Kate Beckinsale. This version is much more true to the spirit of Austen in my opinion and Mark Strong is perfectly cast as a very serious mr Knightly and Emma has just enough arrogance about her person to make it believable.

867919,2,6304383827,"I'm not surprised this movie didn't do better.

Despite a spirited cast and sure-footed direction, this film is a less than a memorable experience.  This is not because of any failing, in my estimation; rather, it is the result of their having done something well:  the filmmakers have portrayed their chief character precisely and unerringly.

In other words, Paltrow is so successful in her role as Austen's officious egoist who fancies herself a master of high society (but who still has a lot of growing up to do) that the movie is actually a displeasure to watch!

True, some of this is made up for later in the movie, but by then Emma has been such an irksome, meddling wench for so long that the character arc completed at the end of the film is unable to get us fully back to rights and leaves behind a sour taste.

In many ways, movies are not like books.  Things can work in a book which will never work onscreen, and vice versa.  Everybody knows this.

But this movie is a textbook example of what happens when you forget this.  In a book, for example, it's okay if the reader doesn't like the main character (e.g., Captain Ahab, Achilles, Pip) as long as he respects and sympathizes with him.  I don't know why, but in a movie this cannot be so.

The main character in a film must be someone you like, or regardless of what else is excellent about the film, the director won't get away with it.  One hole after another will open up, and pretty soon it'll seem like everything's going wrong.  As that's exactly what happens here:  despite superb costume design and art direction, this is a movie that will certainly fail to grab you.

So, in sum, I would say the problem here boils down to the material being unsuitable for the screen.  Those who are really into Austen often cite Emma as her most perfect work, both in terms of structural mastery and character development.

But if you go by this adaptation alone, though, it will be very hard for you to see why.  Don't rip yourself off.",1110499200,4,2000,4.475138121546961

868040,4,6304383827,"First I would like to start with the positive aspects of this version of ""Emma"".  The casting was almost 100% perfect.  Life has never been too hard on Emma, and Paltrow played her with a light-heartedned sweetness, untouched by bitter experience that I found appealing.  Emma may be misguided, but she is good-hearted.  That is how Paltrow played her.

I really enjoyed Northam's portrayal of Knightley.  His thoughtfulness and kindness were expressed well.  His insight into the other characters was displayed.  However, the best aspect was the friendly interplay between Paltrow and Knightley.  They are believable as friends and as lovers. Their future marriage will be a happy one because not only are they attracted to one another; they truly esteem one another.

Juliet Stevenson was WONDERFUL as Mrs. Elton.  Shallow, snide and jealous she was.  I loved to hate her!  Delicious!

The lovely Greta Scacchi played my ideal of Mrs. Weston.  Cultured, feminine, she played Paltrow's friend rather than authority figure, which is how I always felt Austen pictured her.  While Emma always listens to Mrs. Weston, she does not always heed what she says.

Sophie Thompson must be one of the best character actresses to ever come out of the U.K.  Her Miss Bates is Perfection.  In those times, a woman needed to pretty, demure and married.  Poor Miss Bates is none of those things.  She feels herself to be a failure in life.  She is a social person by nature, but society denigrates her.  She is despised by the thing she loves.  Thompson played this very well.

Now for what I didn't agree with in the movie.  I'm sorry, but Harriet Smith was not portrayed accurately in this film version.  This was no fault of actress Colette.  The fault is in direction and script.  Harriet was a simpleton, yes, but she was sweet-natured and quite pretty.  Austen brings this out again and again.  After all, Emma thought that it was possible for her to marry Elton, Churchill and Knightley.  No one would have believed it possible in this Harriet Smith.  Robert Martin would not have married her either.

I also did not care for Polly Walker's version of Jane Fairfax.  Jane is a reserved person in extremely difficult circumstances, living in cramped conditions, facing an uncertain future, in love with man not her equal.  Walker simply played her like an untouchable goddess.  True, that is how Emma sees her at first; that is why she is jealous of her, but that is not how Jane really is.  Jane has feelings and is actually a romantic at heart.  Jane is frustrated and for that suffers headaches and ill health, like we all do when faced with prolonged stress.  That is how I think she should have been played.

However, that does not mean I didn't like the movie.  I did.  I also liked ""Jane Austen's Emma"", but for different reasons.  Really, everyone must do themselves a favor and see them both!",1100131200,,2892,4.778904665314402

868042,4,6304383827,"One of the wonderful things about Jane Austen's stories is that the same set of circumstances - a young woman's coming of age and falling in love - are examined from many different angles. In Emma, the central character is something of a snob. Delightful in her character, she never the less considers herself above just about every one of her acquaintances in some way.

Emma determines, therefore, to play matchmaker. When she meets the lovable - if not extremely intelligent - Miss Smith, Emma is determined to marry her off to one of the upper class gentlemen in the neighborhood.

This is lovely adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. The story remains faithful to the work and the cast is wonderfully chosen (specifically Toni Collette as Miss Smith).

There are several things about the movie that prevent it from being better. First, there is a series of scene changes that take place in mid-sentence. This is cleverly done. In setting up the next scene, the characters suddenly find themselves in it. After a while, though, the rapid scene changes gave me a feeling akin to very slight motion sickness. I think the trick was maybe used just a little too often. Second, the choreography of the ball is horrid, or at least the dancing is. I can't speak to its authenticity, but it seemed to me as if the choreographer had quit half way through. Third and lastly, the language of the film has been updated too much. While I'm sure this makes the film more accessible, I love Jane Austen's dialogue too much to enjoy seeing it pulled too far from the original (""Clueless"" exists as a great modernization of the story - with some fairly major modifications of the plot).

All in all, ""Emma"" is almost enjoyable in movie format as the novel. Toni Collette's portrayal of Miss Smith had me laughing out loud on several occasions, and particularly in her interactions with Paltrow. Likewise, Alan Cumming did a marvelous job as Mr. Elton, only to be outdone by Juliet Stevenson as his wife.

Ms. Paltrow's accent is heinous, and Ms. Collette's work is frankly annoying (though that is in part as written.) As the movie moves from set piece to set piece, lingering endlessly on the beautiful design, one can't help but think that if Ms. Austen's Emma had actually had so much to do, she'd have been little bored enough to spend so much time meddling in her friends' affairs.  But in the end, the good will evinced by all involved somehow makes a film that charms very much in spite of several and severe flaws.  The BBC version of Emma is much superior in adherence to the Austen story, and Clueless certainly has the edge for humor, but this is a fair adaptation that ultimately is more success than failure.",1089763200,2,868,4.515923566878981
868045,2,6304383827,"Ugh!  Paltrow's Emma is cruel and spiteful...it is really hard to feel any symphathy for her; author Jane Austen's Emma deserves much more than this.
Character development falls very short in this movie.  Paltrow's Emma is not consistent - she is sweet in one second, spoiled the next, thoughtful one moment, and thoughtless the next.  This Emma has no conscience - she does not learn from her mistakes, which is crucial to the entire story!  Check out A&E's Emma, starring Kate Beckinsdale - she does Emma a great deal more justice than does Ms. Paltrow.
This becomes most obvious in the scene on Box Hill.  In this version, Emma is nasty to Miss Bates...and on purpose.  You have to remember that Emma is very naive and not really aware of what she is doing.  In the A&E version, you get a better sense of her blunder and of her remorse.
The only good thing in this film is Mr. Knightley - he is quite playful.  Every other character is ridiculous...perhaps this is because the director has to force us to like Paltrow's Emma.
This is a very inaccurate adaptation of Austen's beloved book, and a poor portrayal of her most brilliant, charming female lead.  Of all Austen's character's, Emma is the one who grows the most.  In this movie, she falls far short of growth - no growth of character, no growth in society...nothing.
If you must insist on watching the Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow, watch it, but then do the wise thing...WATCH A&E's VERSION!  Otherwise, you will deprive yourself of a truly great interpretation of Emma.",1087862400,9,1532,4.700374531835206

I will add that the production and costume design in this film is simply a visual delight. The movie thrives on repeated viewings because there's always something new to discover in each scene, be it a meaningful side-glance between Knightley and Emma or a detail in the design of a garden folly.
The DVD edition is woefully sparse on extras, including only the theatrical trailer plus trailers for other Miramax films. You can't tell me that on a film made as late as 1996 there weren't any production stills or taped commentary, or anything?

868110,4,6304383827,"'Emma' is your chance to catch a great set of actors and actresses on their way up, before they became big.  In 1996, Gwyneth Paltrow was better known as either (a) the daughter of Blythe Danner and Bruce Paltrow, or (b) Brad Pitt's one-time fiancee.  In 'Emma,' she rolls out her pitch-perfect English accent for the first time, to be used again over the next couple of years in 'Great Expectations,' 'Sliding Doors,' and ultimately in her Oscar-winning performance in 'Shakespeare in Love.'  'Emma' is a chance to catch a young Paltrow before she became one of those special ""owned by the world"" people identifiable through a single name.
'Emma' has another rocket as well: in a small role, there's Ewan McGregor.  'Emma' was made contemporaneously with *his* breakout performance in 'Trainspotting.'  Make a movie with Paltrow and McGregor today, and it's $20M for starters just to pay the co-leads.

While it is true some liberties have been taken with the story's characters in order to adapt Austen's original work for this film rendition, it is a successful effort.  The set designs, costumes and lighting in many shots are truly picturesque and produce a charming, fairy tale-like glimpse into Regency Period England. Gwyneth Paltrow is to be commended for an affectionate portrayal of the immature and overly-indulged Emma Woodhouse; the viewer likes Paltrow's Emma in spite of her flaws, indeed, because of her flaws the viewer sees the humor in Emma's actions and penchant for meddling (which is no doubt how Austen probably intended Emma to be perceived). Jeremy Northam, as always, shines in Period films.  As Emma's mentor and admirer, his tongue-in-cheek reactions to Emma's missteps and blunders as she navigates her way to adulthood, helps the viewer understand Emma is well-meaning, but still very much a victim of the shortsightedness of her youth.  Toni Colette plays the naive Harriet Smith, who is Emma's trusted friend. The scenes involving the two are well-directed and entertaining and the camera work shows both Paltrow and Colette off to their best advantages.
This film, like ""Sense and Sensibility"" , helped put Austen's works back in the forefront of the entertainment forum and in that respect alone, it is to be commended. The viewer finds themself caring about the characters and the outcome of the story, which is the reaction any author or director strives to achieve.

This ""Emma"" appears to be an attempt to upgrade the story to a more contemporary audience.  The language is made a little more modern (meaning sloppy), the dance music is almost too fast to give time for graceful movement.  A visit to a poor family's cottage is a forced attempt to remind us of life for ""the rest of the folks"".  So this rendition is more PC.
Yet, this movie does present possible logical explanations for some of the A&E gaps, and it does have some interesting spins on how things could progress.  Gwyneth Paltrow does not seem to have the emotive repertoire of Kate Beckinsale, which is a diminishment.  For those of a more classical bent, this rendition might not satisfy.

Flushed with success, she is determined to continue her role as Cupid, which leads to disaster and comedy at every turn.

Director McGrath proves to have a good eye for exterior shots and comedic elements.  The script is delightful, the cast superb, and Rachel Portman's score is faultless.  The real problem with this adaptation is dear Gwyneth.  Paltrow is absolutely lovely and charming as the heroine here, but she is not Emma as written by Jane Austen, and the discrepancy changes the story entirely.  To see this character played to perfection, you must see her played by Kate Beckinsale.  Before you click the ""No"" button, hear me out: watch both films' version of the pivotal scene of the picnic on Boxer Hill, where Emma insults poor chatty Miss Bates.  Austen's Emma is intelligent but thoughtless, generous but as yet unkind, in the way that young people can sometimes be.  The essential drama of Austen's story lies in Emma's realization that she has been mistaken about oh! so many things, in her growth as she internalizes that realization, and in her discovering love when she becomes worthy of it.  By contrast, Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect from the first scene.  She exudes sophistication; she cannot help it.  You never feel that she does not know what's what and who's who, and therefore she cannot develop as Austen means her to.  And that precludes her from playing Emma to perfection.  That said, if you are a Paltrow fan, you will love her in this charming film.  She is effervescent.  If, however, you are an Austen purist, then you MUST see the Beckinsale version instead.

Regardless of your opinion of the film, you WILL be disappointed in this DVD.  Apparently Miramax's Harvey Weinstein has heard of neither bells nor whistles.  Special features listed are: a theatrical trailer, subtitles in English and chapter selection.  And that accurately sums it up.  There's really no excuse for such a trifling package.

868294,4,6304383827,"I suspect that EMMA is more a must for Gwyneth Paltrow fans than devotees of Jane Austen. I understand from one of the latter that this film isn't faithful to the original book. No matter - GP is the reason to see it.
Paltrow plays Emma Woodhouse, who lives with her father at Hartfield, an example of the country manor house obligatory to Austen storylines. Having just been instrumental in getting her governess married off to a rich neighbor, the 21- year old Emma decides to take up match making as a career. After all, it's Regency England and there's not much for a genteel single lady to do with her time. Toiling at the local McFish and Chips to build up the college fund isn't an option. Anyway, most needful of assistance is best friend Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), a respectable enough girl of dubious lineage for whom Emma has plans. Perhaps she can maneuver Harriet into marrying the vicar, Reverend Elton (Alan Cumming), rather than the local farmer whom she loves. Meddling in affairs of the heart is a sticky wicket, but someone has to do it, especially in the absence of a licensed yenta.
And what of Emma's own romantic prospects? There appear to be none. True, Hatfield hosts the frequent visits of the 30-something Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), a well-mannered and well-heeled bachelor from down the carriage road. But he's Emma's brother-in-law, a long standing relationship that seems to preclude anything steamier. However, in one of the film's best scenes early on as Emma and Knightley practice their archery, the two begin bickering over the former's lack of good sense in her handling of the Smith affair. Emma becomes so agitated that she misses the target so widely as to cause Knightley to dryly remark, ""Try not to kill my dogs."" Why, at this point, they seem perfect for each other. One might have thought they were already married.
I know this may be hard to believe, but EMMA has less substance than those other fine film adaptations of Austen novels: PRIDE & PREJUDICE (1996), SENSE & SENSIBILITY (1995), and MANSFIELD PARK (1999). Perhaps it's because the heroines of these other romantic comedies, Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), Elinor Dashwood (Emma Thompson), and Fannie Price (Frances O'Connor) respectively, demonstrate characters of greater pluck, which win the viewer's greater admiration. EMMA's Emma seems flighty and shallow in comparison, and the beguiling Ms. Paltrow plays her to perfection. Northam is superb as Knightley, a gentleman so gentlemanly as to be almost boring. (C'mon, ladies, admit it. Wouldn't a touch of the scoundrel or rake make for a more appealing Mr. Right?)
Any of the Austen screen adaptations will never replace a good Sean Connery or Clint Eastwood flick. But all, including EMMA, are light and entertaining.

868298,4,6304383827,"""Emma"" was made during a spate of Jane Austen films and miniseries awhile back, and thankfully (except for the fiasco called ""Mansfield Park"") all of them have been fantastic. Gwyneth Paltrow provides some droll comic relief as the title heroine of the movie ""Emma,"" proving that yes, she CAN act quite well.
Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow) is on a matchmaking rush after she successfully pairs her former governess to a rich widower. Convinced that she can make a good match for anybody, she sets out to pair her penniless, sweet-natured pal Harriet Smith (Toni Collette) with someone more elevated than a prosperous young farmer, such as the eager young minister, Mr. Elton (Alan Cumming). Problem is, Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma, not Harriet.
More romantic complications ensue when a charming bad boy, Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor in a bad wig) comes to the area and seems to be interested in Emma -- until Emma decides to pair him with Harriet. Emma's good-natured meddling continues unchecked, until it threatens her own happiness and her unspoken love.
""Emma"" is probably the frothiest of Austen's novels; there aren't any big scandals or anything like that.  Embarrassment is the big opponent in here, but Douglas McGrath has a good sense of how to use the droll humor to best advantage. This is definitely a comedy, except for one or two moments near the end; even there, it's amusing when Emma wails ""I love John! I hate John!"". The only source of humor that falls flat is Mrs. Elton, who is too overdone in her vulgarity and stupidity. Bit of a cheap laugh there.
Gwyneth Paltrow seems very in-her-element as Emma, managing to be cute and fumbling without ever making Emma seem precious or stupid. Ewan McGregor may hide whenever he sees his performance, but he's pretty good as Frank (and fans of his should definitely see him sing a duet with Paltrow -- he has a wonderful voice). Toni Collette is sweet as Emma's rather naive younger friend, Denys Hawthorne endearing as Emma's hypochondriac dad (he's kind of weird, but likeably so), Alan Cumming annoying as the juvenile Mr. Elton, and Greta Scacchi does a great turn as Emma's kindly mother-figure. And Jeremy Northam steals the show as Mr. Knightley, the barb-tongued aristocrat with a kindly heart and a genuine affection for Emma, even though her romantic prodding makes him nuts.
There are a few points in the movie where it does seem a little too light and frothy, but fortunately most of the time the direction stays in sync with the storyline.  The lighting, the costumes, the music -- all of them are cute and lightweight. Kids can watch this as well as adults, since there are Disney cartoons that are more offensive than this. (But younger kids will be bored out of their skulls, probably)
""Emma"" is a great film for anyone in search of a genuine comedy with lots of laughs and no stupid gags. Definitely something to watch, especially if you like hearing Ewan McGregor sing or Gwyneth Paltrow freaking out over a failed matchmaking.",1042761600,62,3020,4.8169556840077075

Emma is a spoiled but warmhearted English lady(Gwyneth Paltrow--as in aristocrat) who thinks nothing of interfering with her friends own personal issues and love lives. She makes a mess of trying to guide her newest friend's(Harriet, played by Toni Collette from ""The Sixth Sense""/""Muriels Wedding"")introduction to society and an equal mess of advising her on whom to choose as a suitor. It's only when she realizes her friend has fallen for her dashing best male friend, Mr. Knightley(Jeremy Northrup), that she comes to terms with her own feelings. Although she temporarily devestates her best friend, Harriet, with the news of her engagement to Mr. Knightley, everything comes to rights in the end and Harriet uses her own advice and follows her heart.

However, from the very first scene, I fell so in love with the characters, the beauty of the scenery, and the very witty dialogue, that I could not wait to read the book.  I beg the forgiveness of staunch Jane Austen fans as I must confess my mild disappointment in the book. Not that the book is not a masterpiece itself.  It truly is.  However, this movie was so well done, that my opinion of it is even higher than of the book.  I do not mean to detract in any way from the book.  But I so appreciate the attention to detail in the dress, mannerisms, and sets that make this Regency England!  Of course, Austen needn't have troubled herself with descriptions of this kind as she was writing for those who knew very well the circumstances of the various characters.  But for those of us to whom such society is quite foreign, the visual effects of the movie are quite compelling!  I also found the use of music in this movie to be particularly appropriate to the various scenes, particularly the music surrounding the scene in which Emma is leading Harriet to think less of Mr. Martin & more of Mr. Elton.

Both are faithful adaptations of the book, but I just found the other one had more true spirit.
Also, while Mark Stong, who was Mr. Knightley in the Beckinsale version, is not as classically handsome as the very cute Jeremy Northern (or Northam?  I haven't got my copy with me to check) I found him to be much sexier.  He also seems to exude manliness in an almost palpable way, giving me all kinds of interesting thoughts.  Northam, again, is very handsome, but too droll for the forthright Knightley.

While her intentions are pure, she often ends up being too clever for her own good.  While her plans to secure her friends' happiness go awry, she finds she's left her own life considerably lacking.
This adaptation captures the essence of Jane Austen's brilliant social comedy.  It shows the intricacies of relationships (played by exceptional actors), the humor of human foibles and undue formality, and the dangers of good intentions.
As with all Jane Austen works, the ending (while wonderful) is not as important as the path the story takes in getting there. The creativity of the cast and director, along with the brilliancy of the work itself, makes this version of ""Emma"" a must-see.",1032134400,8,844,4.888111888111888

As an avid admirer of all things Austen I was throughly disappointed. The story was so chopped up, not simply abridged, but chopped, that I didn't feel the closeness of the relationships that I got from the other version and the book. It was sadly 2 dimensional and forced. But, any movie with Ewan MacGragor singing can't be all bad.",1029283200,4,645,4.666666666666667

It succeeds in accomplishing it's purpose, to merely provide an audience with a couple hours of mixed feelings. And the Hollywood version does a great job of that. I thought Paltrow did a great job with the character she was asked to portray...granted, it wasn't the Emma of Jane Austens novel, but that was not because of a lack of acting ability. I think it was simply that the writers for the movie weren't too particularly concerned with keeping the movie faithful to the novel. (Come on, people. We all know that the only thing novels and Hollywood adaptations are going to have in common are the names of the hero's and heroines.) But that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just enjoy it for what it is. Just don't watch it expecting to see anything that is really at all close to the book.
Basically, if you are looking for a movie with a little more meat, go with the A&E version. All the characters, particularly Emma, are much better developed and 3 dimensional in the A&E version. If you are looking for a movie that relates closely to what the author was trying to say, a movie that makes a statement about something, rather than providing mere entertainment, definely, go with the A&E version. Otherwise, watch Paltrows Emma and enjoy it because is an excellent entertainment movie.",1025481600,3,1420,4.616600790513834

The Beckinsale A&E version is much better, and I'm not sure that the BBC version was not the best - I cannot decide.  But this one is superficial and unsatisfying.  Too vague a Jane Fairfax, while Frank Churchill is sometimes too flashy and sometimes too dull and lumpish, while the relationship between these two is undeveloped.  Miss Taylor is too young and foolish, and Mr. Knightley looks still wet behind the ears - no match for his Emma.  Emma is too pretty and Harriet not pretty enough, the hypochondriac father, so richly and amusingly portrayed in both the other versions, is just thrown away here, while the Harriet Smith character is rather wooden and the Harriet-Emma relationship lacks most of the humor Austen wickedly portrayed in it - which the other two versions bring out very well.

Honestly, I have never read the book, and I know absolutely nothing about the clothing or social mannerisms from that period of time. However, I -do- know that Emma is a wonderful movie. Despite the fact that it may not be true to the book, and is historically inaccurate, it does very well as a romantic comedy. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Emma, and I love her confused and indignant expressions throughout the film. Mr. Knightley is definitely my favorite character, and is the perfect gentleman. Every other character fits seamlessly into the mix, and Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill is a yummy and surprising treat. Each and every scene is thoroughly enjoyable.
For nights when you're home alone, and stuck with only your dog and your DVDs, pop in Emma! It'll cheer you up, make you smile, and leave you with a happy feeling inside for a long time afterwards.

868376,4,6304383827,"Yes, this is a MUCH better version of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" than that with Kate Beckinsale! OH, that one had been such torture for me, that looking at this one again a few weeks back was quite a joy.
Gwyneth does a superior job of conveying Emma's own sense of superiority, which is particularly necessary for this heroine, the sole example in Austen's work of a protagonist at the top of the social ladder. Every other young lady in Austen has always to answer to SOMEBODY along the way, but part of Emma's problem is that she has no one to please but herself. Indeed, this is why she encounters as much trouble as she does, because no one can dare counsel her, except Mr. Knightley.
We're still not quite there yet with the Mr. Knightleys, but this fellow at least appears to come from the upper class, whereas the Beckinsale one was decidedly not. Miss Bates, the middle-aged penniless parson's daughter, is on the other hand superb. She's the same actress who played Mary Mosgrove in that excellent ""Persuasion"" some years back. Mr. Elton is served up exceedingly well, too. Somewhat out of Dickens, in the vein of  Uriah Heep.
To give the Beckinsale one its due, though, I must admit that it had the better Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax. Jane in Gwyneth's is too vague a character to amount to much, and of course, she must!
Alas, the character of Lucy still comes up empty. Last time, she was a pale nonentity. This time, she has a stronger silly persona, but is played by a rather lumbering largish person who is not pretty. I presume the casting was thus to ensure that Ms. Paltrow didn't have any competition in her own movie. Lucy, as I stated in the earlier review, is VERY pretty; in fact, her very prettiness is what draws Emma's notice, and convinces Emma that Lucy must marry well, setting off all the matchmaking in the plot.
But still and all, this is the ""Emma"" for me!",1023408000,3,1889,4.523391812865497

868448,4,6304383827,"This is a very different adaptation of a Jane Austen novel to all the others I have seen, but I found the difference refreshing and fun.  There is very little seriousness in this movie and I actually thought it enjoyable to be able to laugh during a period piece.
Emma Woodhouse is a young women with no interest in marrying, so she takes in upon herself to see that she finds a good ""match"" for her new friend, Harriet Smith.  Of course, Emma messes everything up but she barely realizes what chaos she is causing, which is downright funny.  She also thinks she knows everything that is going on in her social circle, but she really doesn't know anything, which is also hilarious.  Finally, Emma quite unexpectedly (to her and to the viewer) falls in love herself, saving everyone from her matchmaking scemes.
Most of the performances in this movie are first-rate.  Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Emma, in my opinion.  She is perfectly snobbish in a likeable sort of way which is exactly what Emma is suppose to be.  Her only flaw is that she might be slightly overbearing, but I really enjoyed her performance.  Jeremy Northam is a perfect Mr. Knightly and Toni Collette is wondeful as the clueless Harriet Smith.  I must give credit for the best performance to Sophie Thompson for her portrayal as the incessant bore, Miss Bates.
What I particularly liked about this Jane Austen adaptation is it was less serious and had more humor.  It is more lighthearted and the wit is more obvious, which not only makes the movie a bit more relaxing to watch then some of the other Austen adaptations, but shows how versitile Jane Austen was as a writer.  I think a great deal of thought went into how the novel would be adapted for this movie, which shows respect for the author.

While the television version has a sharper sense of humour, this is the more enjoyable of the two films.  Gwyneth Paltrow is charming as Emma, she makes you appreciate the characters faults without making you actually hate the character.  Jeremy Northam is very dashing and charismatic as Mr. Knightley, so it's easy to forgive the fact that he is far, far too young (he's supposed to be 16 years older than her, and looks, 5, tops).  Other standouts in the cast are the ever-oily Alan Cummings as the very oily Mr. Elton, and Sophie Thompson, who brings her brilliant comic timing to the role of Miss Bates (real life mother Phyllida Law is along for the ride as the practically comatose Mrs. Bates).  Less successful is Toni Collette, whose Harriet Smith is incredibly annoying as she is over-the-top silly, and drags the rest of the cast's more delicate approach into near-slapstick.
However, that's a small qualm for so enjoyable a film, the type you watch many times, whenever you need a break.",1017619200,5,1074,4.815217391304348

The cast is simply magnificent, and Paltrow is absolutely brilliant as Emma...I should mention too that the movie is a pretty good adaptation of the novel, with the usual limitations of course.

This visual adaptation of Emma is superb. Great acting from Jeremy Northam, Gwyneth Paltrow, Alan Cumming, and Sophie Thompson. But above all, Toni Collette truly steals the show. Her performance of the plain, easily manipulated Harriet was so endearing. She knows, as well as all of us watching, that she belongs with Mr. Martin. However, she is too much taken with Emma, and wishes to oblige her every suggestion of a `worthy' husband. This story is quite sugary compared to Austen's other works, but this characteristic does not diminish the essence of the tale. Simple, warm, and lovely.

868454,5,6304383827,"The first time I saw this movie was when it was released in theaters back in 1996.  I thought it was quite enjoyable and my husband and a guy friend who saw it with us, enjoyed it as well.  However, after watching it, I never really thought about it again.
About a year ago, however, I rented it and just fell in love with it.  After re-renting it so many times, I finally went ahead and bought the DVD.  Frankly, I don't quite understand how I missed how great this movie was the first time.  I suspect it might have been Austen overload, as 1995-96 was right around the time that when Austenmania gripped Hollywood.  Anyhow, I can't say enough about how much fun this movie is and how infinitely re-watchable it is.  The acting by the entire cast, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeremy Northam, Toni Collette, to Sophie Thompson and Phylidda Law, is simply superb.  Gwyneth is much better here than she was (IMO) in Shakespeare in Love.  It's hard to take your eyes off her; her Emma just so funny -- supremely confident in always knowing what's right for everyone and, to her and no one else's amazement, invariably is always proved wrong.  Jeremy Northam is also wonderful as Mr. Knightley.  Austen's Knightley in the book is so gentlemanly and perfect that he can almost be a cipher.  Northam however allows us to see into Mr. Knightley's psyche as he battles with Emma and her machinations, and his own exasperation, anger, jealousy and lust.  His body language and eyes convey it all.  Although Toni Collette is a bit of a miscast because she visually doesn't match Austen's Harriet, she redeems herself admirably by being so lovably dim that you can't help but wish her the happy ending she deserves.  And Sophie Thompson is just perfect:  funny and heartbreaking.
Although I agree with other reviewers that this version of Emma is not perfect (it loses some of Austen's sense of irony, just drops the ball on the Frank and Jane subplot, and never really let's you get too mad at Emma, who frankly deserves it), I think it makes up for it with the sheer joy, beauty, humor and romance of it all.  To put it another way:  As an adaptation, I'd rank it as 3-1/2 stars; as a movie, I give 5 stars plus!  It's just wonderful moviemaking.",1014940800,23,2234,4.54

868456,4,6304383827,"Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing.  ""Emma,"" based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath, stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role.  A self-appointed matchmaker, Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another.  Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, Harriet (Toni Collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying.  Meanwhile, her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emma's, and lend some needed balance to the proceedings.  And Emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all:  Her own.  The world goes `round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat.  Luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings.  Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it.  But as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for Emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment.
 McGrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world.  There may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone:  Love.  And with McGrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing, it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable.  It's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place.  It's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow.
 The winsome Paltrow, who won the Oscar for best actress for ""Shakespeare In Love"" two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre.  She personifies all things British, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether.  She's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy.  She has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.  Yet Paltrow is unique.  As an actor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as ""Hard Eight,"" ""Hush"" and ""A Perfect Murder""-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own.  But it's with characters like Emma that she really shines.  She is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing.  And for Emma, she is absolutely perfect.
 Jeremy Northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of Knightley, and like Paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; his performance in the more recent ""The Golden Bowl,"" in which he played an Italian Prince, was less than satisfying.  Here, however, he is perfect; he is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes Knightley believable and very real.  Like Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in the miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Northam has created a memorable character with his own Mr. Knightley.
 Also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are Toni Collette, as Emma's friend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming, as the Reverend Elton.  Respectively, Collette and Cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film.  And it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre.
 The supporting cast includes Greta Scacchi (Mrs. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Mrs. Goddard), Phyllida Law (Mrs. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill).  An uplifting, elegant film, ""Emma"" is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness.  And even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit.  And that's the magic of the movies.",1006128000,10,5032,4.738231917336395

It's Gwyneth Paltrow at, in my opinion, her best, and Jeremy Northam is a wonderful Mr. Knightley.  He's able to do a good job with what must be a very difficult character to play, since he has to be believable as both the older brother figure of the beginning and the beloved of the end. Toni Collette is an appropriately ditsy and awestruck Harriet, and Juliet Stevenson is a fabulous Mrs. Elton (another difficult character -- to easy for her to slide into farcical buffoonery on the one hand or pure nastiness on the other, when she's really somewhere in between).
The movie itself is bright and cheerful and engaging, which makes it a good candidate to watch several times.
Perhaps my one quibble with the movie would be that Jane Fairfax doesn't get redeemed at the end in the way she does in the book.  Through most of the movie she's perfect.  You just can't tell what's going on in her head; it might be simple reserve or she might genuinely be as boring as Emma thinks she is.  But at the end of the book, you get to see what's going on with her and it's nice.  While I understand that some things need to be cut to turn a book of that length into a movie, I think something should have been done with Jane at the end.  And I must say I prefer Ewan McGregor in his scruffy contemporary roles.  It's a fine performance here, but not quite as convincing as in Trainspotting, for instance.

868534,4,6304383827,"Being a die-hard Austen fan, I couldn't resist watching this movie. Emma Woodhouse's story has always been my favorite of
Austen's efforts, and I am always glad to see her work brought to the screen. I was VERY pleased with this film.
Casting was well done.  Northam provides a sturdy, but not overly-stern, Knightley, and Paltrow does an amazing job of convincing us that she is, indeed, British in her portrayal of Emma.  Her accent is nearly flawless, and I felt that she truly captured the personality of Austen's most spoiled heroine.  The sets and lighting are bright, airy, and perfectly suited to the comedic approach taken by this particular director.  The scenes are edited just brilliantly.  Each scene flows seamlessly from one to another, and the pace of the plot runs along just perfectly.  It moves fast enough to keep everyone interested and slowly enough to make sure that everyone has enough time to absorb what's going on.
The criticism I've heard most often is that the film really only touches on the Jane Fairfax/Frank Churchill subplot for the briefest of moments.  I did not find that to be injurious to the film.  It's plain, while watching this version, that the director wanted to keep the story light and funny.  Adding Jane and Frank's saga would have done two things:  First, it would have seriously darkened and dramatized the bouncy and bright atmosphere of the entire film.  Second, it would have taken the spotlight off of Emma Woodhouse as the focus of the story.  I felt that, given the abbreviated length of time that a movie has in which to communicate a story...the omission of Frank & Jane's affair was a wise choice.
The second criticism I've heard of the film is that it's just too clean and ""pretty"" to be accurately representative of Regency England.  Again...this didn't bother me.  The focus of this film is NOT to be true to history.  It is not a Regency documentary.  It is a fun and aesthetically pleasing depiction of Emma Woodhouse and her friends.  It's romantic, funny, charming, and very very pretty to look at.

Not because this film is not well acted or badly cast, because it is not. I like the entire cast of this film, although Ewan looks just damn silly with thet hair piece/wig whatever, yuck!

However as far as the story the Bekinsale version is much more accurate historicaly and to the novel. The characters are not hollywooded up nor the script dumbed down as the Paltrow version is.

Please if you do like period movies and you liked Emma Thompson's
Sense and Sensibility and the Colin Firth's Pride and Prejudice get the Bekinsale Emma, you will prefer it to this version by a mile!",999043200,9,880,4.380368098159509

The most dramatic moment is when Paltrow's character lets an insult slip out of her mouth - an act most unbecoming a lady.
From a technical point of view, this movie is nicely crafted. The acting is top-notch, and the story is tight. The look and feel of the period shows an attention to detail that is fun to watch.
The only problem is that it was unable to make me care much about any of the characters, or what happened to them. Even when the characters were watching their lives crumbling, I still felt like a member of the audience, watching the actors moving around on the screen.

The character in this version is written as something of a whiner. Mr. Knightley is supposed to be a gentleman of great consequence and responsibility. In the A&E version, Mark Strong may not have the ""looks"" of Jeremy Northam, but he plays the character the way it is supposed to be and is far more believable. Samantha Morton as Miss Smith is far better than Toni Collette (I like Toni Collette, just not in this movie), and Kate Beckinsale is far better in the title role of Emma than Gwyneth Paltrow.

868539,3,6304383827,"I have noticed that particularly well-written stories attract more intelligent reviews than most of the best-selling trash. Not near as many reviews, of course, but much more literate. The same goes for videos. Quite a number of the reviews praising ""Emma"" are among the best I've seen on the Amazon site. Conversely, I found three outstanding negative reviews in which the reviewers stated their dislikes so compellingly that I've had to reconsider my perception of this movie.
For insight into what I mean, read the reviews below by dinkybob2, Anne Woodley, and Ken Groom. Woodley says, ""I am a Janeite and I don't like to see people fiddling around with the divine Austen."" Serious writers have been studying Jane Austen's works for 200 years. Patrick O'Brian said he unabashedly adopted elements of her style. (Which is, of course, why writers study other writers.) Woodley speaks for me, too, when she says, ""The fact that Austen's perfect words have been read with great enjoyment for hundreds of years leaves me wondering why script writers are so determined to improve them...""  It takes a mighty big ego for a screenwriter to presume to improve Jane Austen's use of dialog.
Dinkybob2 disliked the ""laughability of the historical accuracy of this version of 'Emma'"", and she explains why. Ken Groom expressed the same objection. Dinkybob2 objected to a passionate and graphic kiss between Emma and Mr. Knightly, and explains, ""The Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle 'Pride and Prejudice' shows what I think is a lovely example of how people in love would've behaved together [in that period]."" Many persons familiar with eighteenth-century social customs, as they were accurately described by Jane Austen, would agree.
Austen fans identify the characters she created down to the last detail, and their precisely-described conduct as well. Indeed, has any author ever excelled Jane Austen in characterization and scene descriptions? Both dinkybob2 and Anne Woodley suggest other screen adaptations of Jane Austen's books which they feel are superior to Emma, and they provide lucid reasons for their opinions.
This forum for customer comments presented by the Amazon site is one of its most valuable features. Contrasting viewpoints, when well expressed, are highly influential in my buying decisions.
Maybe I was misled into believing I enjoyed this film because the version produced by BBC was so gosh-awful. (I'm pleased that it isn't offered on the Amazon.com site.) Austen said Emma was ""nearly"" twenty-one. The actress who played Emma for BBC was at least 35 when the film was made, or looked it. Jane Austen would not have considered her ""handsome,"" as she described the real Emma. BBC's Mr. Knightly was combative with Emma, not sensibly argumentative and genteel during their debates.
Among the grievous aspects of the BBC movie was that the screenwriter had the audacity to completely rewrite Austen's superb dialog between Emma and Mr. Knightly.
Most viewers who posted comments on this ""Emma"" liked the movie. Maybe you will too. But, then again, some four out of five readers out of over 1000 who commented on ""Cold Mountain"" were very positive in their reviews while I thought it was a piece of trash.

868541,4,6304383827,"Douglas McGrath's 1996 version of ""Emma"" is an absolute delight!  Modern actors put a new and fresh spin on a timeless classic.  Emma's character is brilliantly captured by award-winning actress, Gwyneth Paltrow.  The viewer can sympathize with Emma, despise Emma, and fall in love with Emma all in a matter of two hours.  Emma's innocence and good heart is exactly what causes pain to many.  It is this age-old internal struggle that makes you fall in love with Emma.  Emma's escapades will have you wondering, laughing, and may even jerk a tear from your eye.  The modern actors bring a fresh look to a story that will live on forever. Emma is the upscale twenty-one year old daughter of Mr. Woodhouse(played by Denys Hawthorne).  Emma is a good natured, yet very sheltered girl with an amusement for the art of matchmaking.  Emma has been quite successful at making matches among her friends and neighbors.  It is Emma's success that is her failure.  As Emma becomes more successful at making matches, she obtains a sense of graditude and learns to endulge in self-reward.  Making others happy is soon overcome by her own obsession to be successful at making them happy.  To the townspeople, Emma is a symbol of perfection.  There are two people who are able to see Emma's faults, Mr. Knightly and the viewer.  Emma depises the fact that Mr. Knightly (played by Jeremy Northam) is able to see her faults and call her on them.  As Emma matures throughout the movie, it is the honesty of Mr. Knightly that she learns to love.  One of the main themes in the movie is the old adage ""you find love where you least expect it"".  Emma definately finds love where and when she least expects it.  It is a bit ironis that Emma falls in love while attempting to make others fall in love.  During Emma's failures, she confides in her only true friend, Mr. Knightly.  Emma and Mr. Knightly's solid friendship is the foundation for what is to be a healthy relationship.  ""Emma"" is a friendly reminder to us all...that the one you love the most, may very well be the one you considered least.

868672,4,6304383827,"The movie Emma, directed by Douglas McGrath, is a delightful romantic comedy based on the 1816 Jane Austen novel by the same name.  The movie contains an abundance of irony and comedy.  In addition, this story is filled with love triangles, hidden romances, false assumptions, love vs. hate, anger vs. forgiveness, truthfulness, friendship, humiliation and a happy ending.  This story is based around a single character, Emma Woodhouse.  Being the youngest daughter and left alone with her praising father, Emma grew up to be a fine and kind lady, with an inkling of matchmaking her friends and a vain perception of herself.  Emma decides to befriend a local woman, Harriet Smith.  Emma takes Harriet under her wing and turns her into a lady of society.  Emma's matchmaking talents soon persuade her to set Harriet up with the local reverend, Mr. Elton.  Harriet falls in love with Mr. Elton while Emma tries to make their affections mutual.  This all fails when Mr. Elton reveals his true affections for the lovely Miss Woodhouse instead.  When Emma denies her love for Mr. Elton, he leaves the countryside and marries a pompous and talkative city woman.  Emma tries her matchmaking skills again when trying to set up the son of her friends Mr. and Mrs. Weston with Harriet.  Mr. Frank Churchill, the son, is a friendly and vivacious man who befriends both Emma and Harriet.  Throughout Emma's matchmaking ordeal, her long time friend, Mr. Knightley, repeatedly tells Emma to stop her medalling in other people's business.  Despite Emma's thought perfection by all the characters, she is really put in her place at the picnic on Box Hill.  Emma mocks the annoying and boring Miss Bates in front of all the other characters.  Mr. Knightley then scolds her afterwards.  This is a turning point for Emma.  She now realizes that she may not be as kind and perfect as she once thought.  Another realization comes over Emma when she recognizes that her feelings for Mr. Knightley are more than just friendship; she is in love with him.  Her love is then tested when Harriet reveals to Emma that she is too in love with Mr. Knightley.  But Emma does not reveal her true feelings to Harriet.  Mr. Knightley leaves the countryside to visit his family in the city.  Emma feels lost because Mr. Knightley left before she could speak to him and Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton are ignoring her because of her actions at the picnic.  Finally, Mr. Knightley returns.  He confides in Emma that he felt she had affections for Frank Churchill.  But Frank actually had affection for the niece, Jane Fairfax, of Miss Bates; their engagement was a secret and a shock to society.  Mr. Knightley also confesses that this made him jealous because of his love for Emma.  Emma rejoices in this news, and the two become engaged.  Harriet herself becomes engaged to her past beau, Mr. Martin.  The story ends well with both women engaged and the whole of the town is happy.  I truly enjoyed this movie.  The authentic costumes and genuine way the actors spoke really made the movie realistic.  Gwyneth Paltrow truly made the character of Emma come to life.  Her facial expressions and innocent yet prying voice made her the flawless and perfect lady Emma sets to achieve.  The story line keeps the audience interested with its twists, secrets and revealing of affections.  The movie starts simple, with the center on its main character Emma, then expands to encompass the whole of all the characters, and ends with the resolution of all problems.  I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a quick fix of romance or who likes movies with old English comedy or who enjoys to watch a movie full of destruction and chaos come together in the end.",978825600,6,3712,4.788976377952756
868673,5,6304383827,"Classy.  Flawless.  Triumphant.  All words that can be used to describe the film ""Emma.""  This educational love story turned out to be one of the most appealing matchmaking films that I have even seen.  Everyone, including characters and readers alike, seem to be taken back in awe of Emma's desirability, complexity, and purity, in part due to the appeal of the essential English image being portrayed.  Emma, in general, comes off as a simple woman, but by looking deeper, it can be seen that she is a complex woman who is genuine, affectionate, and altruistic, while at the same time selfish, mislead, judgmental, and myopic.  This all adds up to the woman as a whole and is what makes the story interesting.  ""Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match.""  This seems to be the phrase that continuously echoes in Emma's head.  Love will always find a way, but to Emma, it must be her way or no way.  This is her one greatest downfalls - the fact that ""she"" is blind, rather than the love.  Emma is convinced that men know nothing about their hearts when, in actuality, it is she who knows nothing about her own.  She is convinced that her judgment is always correct, but unfortunately, she is fool-heartedly misunderstanding of everything.  Could this possibly be because she has never loved before?  Is this an unconscious self-defense?  One will never know and may only speculate.  All of Emma's undesirable qualities are eventually dealt with tactfully - in the form of Mr. Knightley.  He is the one voice of reason in the film, and without him, Emma may never have been able to grow to be the extraordinary woman that she is capable of being.  Knightley sees Emma for what she is and for what she is capable of achieving, understanding both her foolish aspects and also her good heart - the aspect that is readily apparent and which wins everyone's charm.  Yet, Knightley realizes that Emma must grow as a person - exactly the point of the movie - and hides his feelings for fear of endangering his friendship with Emma.  Eventually, love wins him over though and he realizes that in order to help her, he must reveal his love for her.  In short, he realized that he must take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity before it was too late, no matter what the cost may be to himself, for women like Emma are few and far between.  Every other character in the film represents some sort of aspect as love in its entirety.  For instance, Emma's father is the male figure that fulfills every positive quality that Emma searches for in a man - whether it be for friends, such as Harriet or Mrs. Taylor/Weston, or for herself.  This represents somewhat of an electra complex in the film (the daughter desiring a man with her father's qualities).  Emma's major problem though is that she judges people initially at the surface and does not allow herself to be open to the qualities that may fulfill her needs.  Although Mr. Knightley may be perfect for her, she does not realize this until she allows herself to open up to love, experience it, and be truly loved.  This is the sign of maturity that Mr. Knightley had hoped and waited for and also that which he will be forever thankful.  ""Emma"" as a whole was an exceptional film in which maturation, deception, selfishness, sincerity, and ultimately love played major roles.  In its entirety, ""Emma"" offers a wide array of aspects of love that are revealed in a timely fashion throughout the movie.  Only through this meticulous process may Emma - the mislead, selfish girl - mature into Emma - the headstrong, altruistic woman.  Although Emma may never achieve the perfection in Mr. Knightley's eyes as she does in those of her friends, - which is not necessarily a negative aspect, for then it would not be true love - she does manage to capture the hearts of the audience and enables the film to be as near to perfect as it may possibly be.",978825600,,3900,4.631732168850073

Gwyneth Paltrow plays a typical girl in the movie Emma, directed by Douglas McGrath (I).  Emma Woodhouse (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is a snobby, rich girl who tries to play the town's matchmaker.  Miss Emma holds parties for her single friends and pretends that everyone will fall deeply in love, but never wanting herself to be in that very position of love.  Mr. Knightley, played by Jeremy Northram, tries to keep Miss Emma aware of her selfishness.  Mr. Knightley reminds Miss Emma that she cannot make everyone fall in love; everyone is not always a match made in heaven.  Jeremy Northram is the only person who will stand up to Gwyneth Paltrow and is not afraid to speak his mind.  Miss Emma only sees Mr. Knightley as a friend, he reminds her of a brother.  Soon enough, the brother-sister relationship grows into something more affectionate.  The Director, Doug McGrath (I), does a wonderful job of taking the romance scenes and adding comedy into them.  He makes Emma out to be a rich, snob but she is very witty and quick with her words.  Miss Woodhouse said, ""The most beautiful thing in the world is a match well made.""  Emma is the town's matchmaker; therefore, she only sees beauty in putting people in uncomfortable situations and that may conclude in marriage.  Nonetheless, Mr. Knightley always puts her back in reality and tells her that matchmaking is not the most beautiful thing in the world. Gwyneth Paltrow does a beautiful acting job.  Her elegance and grace coincides with her athleticism and wittiness.  Throughout the movie Miss Paltrow is riding horses, shooting a bow and arrow, and dancing.  Her character is always getting into mischief or, usually, she is the cause of it, but somehow using her wittiness she finds a way out of it. Miss Paltrow fits very well into the character of Emma Woodhouse.  The only thing I did not care for was those crazy hairstyles.  It was always curled funny all over the place.  She could have at least neatly made it lay nicely on her head.  Gwyneth Paltrow character was suppose to play one of perfection, not someone with hair all over the place.  It did not work out well with her athleticism, but is did work with Miss Emma's smart comments.  Also, it did not make the rich girl look so elegant.  Her dresses were of elegance, but not her hair.  Overall, I really liked this movie.  It was definitely a chick flick and a romance story.  I think the actors and actresses portrayed the characters very well and did a wonderful job throughout the movie.  Also, the director played a huge role in helping the actors and actresses do such a wonderful job and adding the comedy with the romance.

868675,4,6304383827,"""Emma"" starring Gwyneth Paltrow is a wonderful tale of friendship and what happens when the line is crossed.  Emma Woodhouse is a whitty, clever and somewhat manipulative girl who finds the art of matchmaking exciting.  Emma finds her matchmaking skills successful when her nanny, Miss Taylor marries Mr. Weston.  Due to the successfulness of Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston's marriage, Emma tries to setup her friend Harriet Smith with Mr. Elton, a somewhat annoying character who turns out to adore Emma rather than Harriet Smith. Emma now doubts herself as a matchmaker and decides to give up the practice altogether.
Mr. Knightly is a man who is the only person to find fault in Emma and her actions.  He is very honest and direct with her, and it is his opinion that matters the most to Emma.  Emma at times finds his opinions to be rather harsh, but realizes after awhile that they are true.  For instance, during a picnic Emma says an inappropriate comment to Mrs. Bates, the local busybody.  Mrs. Bates is stunned and embarrassed by the comment and finds herself on the verge of tears.  Emma seems to think that no harm was caused and that Mrs. Bates deserved to be put in her place.  Mr. Knightly runs after Emma and explains to her that he is repulsed and likewise embarrassed by her actions.  Emma does take his words to heart and sobs uncontrollably.
I love the way this movie incorporates the various characters and presents them in an organized fashion.  I found myself identifying with many characters, in particular Harriet Smith, because I have been setup with people who have not exactly ""worked out.""  Gwyneth Paltrow plays a very believeable character of Emma.  She incorporates the innocence and yet is able to manipulate most anyone to do what she thinks is best for them.  For example, Harriet Smith receives a marriage proposal from Mr. Martin, a man she is quite fond of.  Rather than be happy for her, Emma immediately tells Harriet to forget about his proposal and continue to pursue Mr. Elton.  In the end, Mr. Elton marries a very selfish woman and Emma, for awhile, loses her friendship with Harriet.  Harriet eventually forgives Emma for the trouble she has caused and congratulates Emma on her engagement to Mr. Knightly.
I find this movie to be lighthearted and a movie in which, the events are presented without much thinking from the audience.  In other words, it was a very well versed movie that really left some things to the imagination.  The fact that it is a romance/comedy is appealing to me, so of course, I took particular interest in this movie.  I did feel though, that in some places the movie did somewhat drag and I felt that the character of Mr. Frank Churchill was a little weak.  Overall, I was very pleased with this movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in a well-developed romance/comedy movie.",978739200,,2856,4.752535496957404
868676,2,6304383827,"I admit, although being a great Jane Austen fan, ""Emma"" is not among my favorite of her books.  She herself said that in creating Emma, she was creating a character that no one but she would like.
I just wanted to comment on the relative laughability of the historical accuracy of this version of ""Emma"".  The costumes, while pretty to the untrained eye, are horrendous from a historical standpoint.  Look up a book on paintings or fashion plates from the Regency era to get an idea of what people really wore.  I didn't think many of them were even particularly flattering to the actors.  I also imagine Jane turning over in her grave at the scene where Emma and Mr. Knightly declare their love for one another and then promptly embrace passionately, interlocking tongues and everything else.  The expression ""Get a room"" didn't exist then, and for very good reason.  No one would've conducted themselves like that in public, and even in private, unless they were married.  The Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle ""Pride and Prejudice"" shows what I think is a lovely example of how people in love would've behaved together.  In the very last scene, as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy pull away from the church in their carriage, they shyly look at each other and then slowly move in for a kiss, not quite sure how to approach it.  Then they exchange a modest kiss, not a tongue-down-each-others-throat kiss.  Elizabeth has surely never held hands with a man, much less kissed one.  It's only our horribly immodest society today that allows tongues to be seen in public.
Aside from the historical accuracies, I think this version does shine in some parts.  I think this version of ""Emma"" has the best of the Miss Bates.  I also enjoy the Mrs. Elton in this version also.
There is some fairly good acting here.  I do not censure the actors.  They are even fairly accurate to the original story.  I just find fault with the historical portrayal, which I think is essential to a period movie.  Nowadays film is the way that the general public becomes acquainted with different time periods.  They will come away from films like this with an incorrect understanding of the way things were in Jane Austen's time.",977011200,21,2189,4.728232189973615
868677,2,6304383827,"I was so disappointed with this - I should declare my interest right from the start - I am a Janeite and I don't like to see people fiddling around with the divine Austen - and that is the main reason why I really don't like this movie. Bearing in mind that other's don't mind things being fiddled around with then I have to say that this movie is exceptionally pretty - the costumes and cinematography are undeniably beautiful. It is also paced well and I have probably thought it quite funny if didn't know that Austen was actually both a lot more subtle and a hell of a lot funnier.
Also, try as I might I just can't see Paltrow is right in the lead role of Emma. She is too skinny, and pouty - not at all the vision of Regency beauty depicted in contemporary portraits. Paltrow does do a fine job with the accent being America's favourite faux Brit-girl. But her role isn't helped by they script writers who have messed with book too much in my opinon and thus changed Emma to someone a lot more mean-minded..
On the plus side I just loved the two actors who played Mr and Mrs Elton (Juliet Stevenson and Alan Cummings). They have hit the characters off to a T. Mr Weston is also pretty good as is Frank Churchill (played by Ewan McGregor)  - but couldn't they have given him a more convincing haircut?
Perhaps it is the nature of the script but I found Mr Woodhouse completely out of character. The subtlety of Austen's portrayal of this character in the novel is completely lost to the script writers. In her book Mr Woodhouse is an ailing invalidish sort with poor understanding - by all acccounts he should fade into the background, yet Austen allows him to dominate many scenes, with his lack of understanding, repeated comments. The ultimate in overwhelming sickness. In this filmed version Mr Woodhouse strides around manfully full of ruddy good health, but little influence - a complete turn around and he lacks the influence he holds in the book over Emma and Mr Knightley.
Emma is also changed in character. In the novel the subtelty of how Emma interprets events around her - and how they actually appear is almost lost. In the novel, Emma never completes anything - except the portrait of Harriet - and that is quite important to the plot.
The gradual build up in her frustration and that she is led astray by Frank Churchill's lack of social graces is also a necessary plot element in the novel. In this film we see quite a petulant and not particularly nice Emma right from the start - someone who is prepared to gossip meanly to Harriet about the Miss Bateses. I just didn't think a pouty, truculent portrayal of Emma was necessary - nor a rather sulky portrayal of Mr Knightly
As to Harriet Smith she is supposed to be stunningly beautiful. Not taking anything away from Toni Collette who I do think is very pretty - they didn't do a good job in fitting her out with flattering costumes - or hairstyles, and I don't think she rates as stunningly beautiful at all. Its quite a key point to the book really - and it was something that would have been pretty easy to do.
I realise, in the interest of the length of the film it is necessary to cut down scenes, and cut out elements, but very often they completely rewrote lines which altered the scene's meaning completely (Mr Elton's comments on Emma's portrait of Harriet, The first meeting of Frank Churchill and Emma, even the opening wedding scene) All unnecessary. The fact that Austen's perfect words have been read with great enjoyment for hundreds of years leaves me wondering why script writers are so determined to improve them to so little evident result.

Gwyneth Paltrow gave an excellence performance playing Austen's heroine. She obviously did her homework. With polished english accent,she sang and played the piano,dance,sew,draw,played archery,and not forgetting acted as Cupid.  Being the backbone of the movie,Emma Woodhouse tried to matchmake friends around her namely Harriet Smith. The outcome showed she clearly not quite cut out to be cupid however things seem to turn out well and merry eventually--thanks to the crafty works by Jane Austen.

I have not seen the other version of this movie.
When  motivated to read through the novel again after watching this movie, I came to the conclusion that the movie is BETTER than the novel, in the sense that it eliminates a lot of Austen's excessive verbiage about all the fine details of interpersonal relationships. In other words, while this movie has some great dialogue (and yes, many of the best lines are taken verbatim from the novel),  it  is not overwhelmed by dialogue. This is a visual film, not too intellectual.
The actors who play Emma and Mr. Knightly are wonderful, great chemistry tother. I think that the buxom woman who plays Harriet gives a believeably youthful & bashful performance.  The hypochondriac father is not overdrawn, and Jane Fairfax is played by a dark-eyebrowed woman with a slight resemblance to Liz Taylor.
The photography in this movie is OUTSTANDING. Some of the scenes I had to rewind to watch over again because they were so exquisitely lovely to look at. The various scenes are expertly transitioned, sometimes humorously, and this fluid movement from scene to scene in many ways reminds me of the filmmaking in the hit movie _Titanic_.
I fervently disagree with those who dislike this movie. This is an *excellent film* for Jane Austen fans. The romantic scenes at the end were a little sappy and stererotypical, but I cried and cried. It drew such emotional response.  It is such a moment of enlightenment when Emma figures out that Mr. Knightly is her husband of choice.  He is so subtle and English, and they are a perfectly matched couple. Watch this movie!!!",973641600,2,1929,4.7432835820895525
868721,3,6304383827,"The  only way in which this film is better than the TV version is in the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma. Emma is an exceptional character and an exceptional actress was needed to play her. But,  apart from her, the film suffers from a whole series of deplorable miscastings and whoever was responsible for the casting can surely not have read the novel. Mark Strong as Mr Knightley in the TV version is  infinitely to be preferred to Jeremy Northam. Mr Knightley is a responsible, serious-minded, authoritative figure and is described by Jane Austen as having a ""downright, decided, commanding sort of manner."", a world away from the light-weight charmer as portrayed by Jeremy Northam, who, good actor though he is, had not the height or physical presence the role calls for. Ewan MacGregor is also badly miscast in the role of Frank Churchill, who is supposed to be suave and sophisticated. Ewan MacGregor is anything but that.
However, the worst piece of miscasting  by far is that of Toni Collette in the role of Harriet; she is too physically large for the role. Jane Austen refers to the character as ""little Harriet"" and describes her as a ""humble, grateful  little girl"". And I must say Samantha Morton, who took the role in the TV adaption, was absolutely perfect in the part.
But the film as a whole was too romanticised and idealised. I am not willing to believe that people  ever lived like that. Whereas the authenticity of the TV adaption was remarkable. It was like looking through a window into the 19th century. I felt - this is the way it must have been.",971136000,6,1576,4.671480144404332

Granted, the first few minutes are tedious: there is much information to cover to get you up to speed, and if you look  at the directing, it looks as if only one camera was used to film the  opening (there are no close ups or different angles). But hang tight.  The  fun is just beginning!
Paltrow plays a delightful Emma, endearing and at  the same time madening. Northam plays a wonderfully reserved but passionate  Mr. Nightly. Play close attention to the scenes when they're together,  catch his phrasing, subtle eye movements, his body language around her. He  is in pain and you can feel it! Oh, Wonderful! Just what a romance should  be.
As others have mentioned, Miss Bates is wonderful, as are Mr. and  Mrs. E.- I, also, found the Harriet Smith character dull, and Jane Fairfax  seemed to have stepped into the wrong movie. But all in all, for those of  you who are non-Jane-Austen-Purists, you will find yourself delightfully  surprised.

868726,5,6304383827,"Ah, this is a fun movie!
A relatively faithful adaptation of the Jane Austen novel is a bigscreen treat (the recent ""Mansfield Park"" was a disaster). Even looking at the cover is nice.
An unusually good  Gwyneth Paltrow plays the well-intentioned but inept Emma, a pretty, witty  aristocrat who believes that ""the most beautiful thing in the world is  a match well made!"" Having married off her ex-governess to a family  friend, she decides to take a poor friend of hers under her wing and find  Harriet Smith a husband, but royally botches it in the process. Amid the  tangle of loves, infatuations, and deceptions, Emma discovers that her own  true love has been standing off to the side...
Paltrow is genuinely  enjoyable-she practically glows. Ewan McGregor is totally convincing as the  two-faced charmer Frank Churchill (despite his own claims, he does a good  job). The actors playing Mr. Knightly, Harriet Smith, and the usual smarmy  pastor and his creep of a wife are jewels.
It doesn't have quite the  emotional resonance of ""Sense and Sensibility"", the BBC  ""Mansfield Park,"" or ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but  ""Emma"" is something of a lightweight story--there isn't much in  the way of scandals. It's a nice bit of G-rated fun and comedy, enjoyable  but not too heavy.",964051200,28,1277,4.924882629107981

While it does have some funny  and entertaining parts (also the costumes ARE good) it simply doesn't do  justice to the book or the charaters. Too long on farce and too short on  charm.

Jeremy Northam's Mr. Knightly joins Colin Firth and  Ciaran Hinds as the perfect Austin heroes, strong, subtle, sweet. Paltrow  portrays a nice sweet, good-intentioned style for Emma, although she does  seem to have only two expressions (""pouting"" and  ""deleriously happy"". Okay, maybe ""puzzled"" as well.)

But  this is so evidently awkwardly made that it is embarassing and it  sufficates the briming potential energy that everyone seems to have in this  film.
And Ewan McGregor as the supposed rake who behaves most  inappropriately is incredibly wooden.
The only redeeming feature this  film has is Alan Cumming who is terrific as the pompous Mr. Elton - it is  just a shame he is let down by everything else.",955929600,2,696,4.639344262295082

Jane Austen feared that readers wouldn't like Emma as much as she liked her, but thanks to Ms. Paltrow, the people who watch this movie will never be able  to picture any other face than hers when reading Emma. Beside Ehle as  Lizzie Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, this is the only adaptation of an  Austen book where the actress actually gets the heroine perfect! Watch for  Paltrows slight wrinkle of brow, and cross looks when being chastised by  Mr. Knightly. And Thompson's rendition of Miss Bates is absolutely  wonderful. This is a darling movie - hey, so what if the character  development lacks a little, it's fun, entertaining, gets the message across  and is beautiful to watch.

Almost as quickly as she became hot, she was not. I  just don't think many had realized it yet.
Emma is a weak premise, at  best, and this interpretation is outright intolerable. To say it pales in  comparison to Clueless may be brash, considering the teen-fodder compost  that was the Amy Heckerling version.
Sometimes classic literature should  remain just that, literature.

Those eyes, those smiles, that long neck, everything about her  exemplifies elegance, and more importantly, her talents as an actress match  her beauties, making her such a rare treasure on-screen. Her current role  in the critically acclaimed Shakespeare in Love might very well earn her  first Oscar nomination for Best Actress. I'll be watching the show at home  and cheering like an idiot. In the meantime, we can relish her breakthrough  role in Emma that is now available on DVD from Disney.
Jane Austen's Emma  is by far the most accessible of her many timeless novels, the adaptation  is lighthearted and fun, and yet, sophisticated enough to appeal to those  with an intellectual bend. Paltrow's portrayal of Emma is remarkable, she  embodies the spirits of the character, well-intentioned if not a bit naive  that led her into all sort of troubles when trying to be a matchmaker for  her friends, and nearly giving away her true love. Her performance is  instantly likeable without being over the top in sweetness, as Alicia  Silverstone is in Clueless, the modern adaptation. Directed by Douglas  McGrath, whose credits include the screenplay of Bullets Over Broadway,  Emma is immensely enjoyable with a crowd-pleasing ending that makes  everything seem just right. If only that could be the real  world.
Unforutnately, the DVD production left something to be desired.  Disney, with all their financial might, is incredibly stingy in offering  features on their DVDs. ""Chapter Search"" and ""Dolby  Surround"" should not be listed as special features on the back cover,  and including a theatrical trailer should be a minimum bonus. We are  grateful, folks at Disney, that you are releasing films on DVD, but stop  trying to fool the public with bogus extras, which are standard, and start  releasing some substantial supplemental materials to your great library of  films. While you are at it, I beg you to please remove that ugly  ""Widescreen"" arch from the cover design. It is nothing but an eye  sore and serves no purpose whatsoever.
With that out of the way, let's  move on to the transfer. The picture is perfectly framed at the approximate  ratio of 1.85:1. To further incense the consumers that like their format  pan and scan, it is not offered, even though that version could have easily  fitted on the unused side of the single-layer DVD. Normally, I could care  less about the pan and scan format, but offering both versions on the same  DVD when possible would appeal to everyone. The picture exhibits no  apparent digital artifacts, but does contain few dirt particles.  Cinematographer Ian Wilson (The Crying Game) shots the film with delicate  lighting and gauzy filters that lend softness to the images. During  defining moments, shade and lighting are used in great effect to accentuate  the characters and surroundings. The English countryside provides for a  picturesque backdrop. Colors are well saturated from the soft warm glow of  candlelight to sunlight filtering through windows. The Oscar nominated  costume design by Ruth Myers (L.A. Confidential) looks gorgeous draping on  Paltrow, and for the men attired in the most civilize and gentleman  manner.
The audio encoding is listed as Dolby Surround, but the rear  channels are nearly none existence during the movie. Occassionally, when  the orchestrated score swells up would the rear speakers participate.  Rather, the source is through the front speakers, with the center channel  getting the majority of the activities. The soundtrack is blessed by the  Oscar winning score composed by Rachel Portman, the first female to ever  win in that category. Like Emma, the score is instantly likeable and  affectionate, as first heard on the opening credits. Consist of mostly  strings ensemble, the score is lyrical and melodious and when needed be,  provides for a lively ballroom sequence. Imaging and panning are not as  prominent as I would like, however, dialogue sounds natural throughout.
On a side note, Alliance Video, which owns the distribution right in  Canada, offers the DVD with an English and French soundtrack.",916185600,3,4263,5.091172214182344
