8432925,5,B004KG09QU,A fascinating time capsule of the musical underground scene in London around 1981/82. The Thompson Twins footage alone makes it worth the  price. Were we really that young?,1441238400,,172,5.142857142857143

8432927,5,B004KG09QU,"If you're a New Musik fan this is the only DVD where you can watch Tony Mansfield and his band playing .
Quite apart from the punk scene this appearence showed this exquisite inspired pop band playing live . You might want to check how its music still lingers this millennium  and captivates a legion of faithful fans still missing the never released forth album .",1362355200,2,364,4.515151515151516
8432928,5,B004KG09QU,"As a Thompson Twins' fan, I was intrigued when I read that Listen to London featured raw and rare footage of the rowdy 7-piece band before they divided into a trio. If you think about it, how much of Thompson Twins' lead vocalist Tom Bailey have we actually seen when he wasn't posing in new wave day-glow? More importantly, this video debunks the myth that bands from the pioneering MTV generation from the 1980s became successful overnight without paying their dues. I enjoyed the fact that the film moves along in sections featuring artists that most Brits yet alone Americans, have ever heard of. However, the results are engaging and I was shamelessly engrossed in this DVD for several days. I developed a craving for this music which unfortunately I'll never be able to satisfy considering that the majority of these bands were never signed and disbanded probably only a few short months after their contributions were made to Listen to London. Finally, if you want to surprise your fans, play a game of ""Where's Waldo"" watching the film to see if you can spot a pre-fame Boy George playing keyboards..... Just one of many surprises you'll see in this unique yet essential documentary.",1296000000,3,1191,4.8431372549019605
8432929,5,B004KG09QU,"Documentaries are often told from a bias perspective, yet the viewer is often left with an 'impression' that is sadly fabricated based on the motive of the filmmaker. However, Listen to London allows viewers to draw their own conclusion based on the testimonies and interviews of each of the bands featured in this film. Unlike VH-1 mockumentaries highlighting the 1980s that thrive on humiliation and comedy, Listen to London is an actual collection of films shot in various locations of London guerilla-style, capturing some of the most intuitive artists performing during the post-punk movement sweeping the country in 1981. One of the beauties of this film is that the performances are caught on tape in some of the most unlikely places, including abandoned homes, unequipped warehouses and sweaty pub stages - some of which are a hit away from being signed to big labels while others would righteously be destined to be brilliant yet undiscovered. Cases in point include the Thompson Twins, captured here as a scruffy 7-piece outfit one year before scaling down to pop trio that would later conquer the world with a string of hit singles internationally, and BIM, a youthful energetic dance band that prove to be wildy popular among club enthusiasts but failed to achieve any major recording contract outside of a few very hard to find 12'' singles. Music isn't the only focus of the film; the filmmakers bravely went to the sidewalks of Soho and interviewed street fans of the new romantic movement to determine the root of their interests, embracing their tastes in music while disclosing their nuclear fears. The results are enlightening and chilling. Overall, Listen to London is the must-see documentary for pop culture historians, fans of alternative music, and Eighties' aficionados that claim the decade as the most exciting period of the 20th Century. Highly-recommended.",1295740800,6,1885,5.163398692810458
