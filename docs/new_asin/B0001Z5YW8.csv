DO NOT BUY WMA Videos, you will be stuck watching them on your PC, Movies are meant for TVs box up and trash Unbox- it is unamerican!!",1201737600,3,287,4.107142857142857
8018770,4,B0001Z5YW8,Can anyone confirm this is the COMPLETE collection. 21 episodes there are a number of episodes in 2 parts. There is also another very old highly racist episode called Tintin in the Congo not on this set. Including this there were originally 39 episodes in book format. I saw them all in England back in the 1960s or so. I have this set. I play it on a Philips Blue Ray DVD player hacked to convert the DVD trigon code to all regions. the PAL to NTSC conversion then occurs completely on the fly and works well. I have purchased many DVDs from the UK and this process is much the easiest way to go. You could also buy an external DVD player for the computer USB and then set it permanently yo Region 2 to play UK DVDs but the set top Philips box is much easier. Only issue is if the player is network connected an update may revert it to Region 2 so yo need to reenter the hack. it is a 4 char numeric code entered on the remote. Very easy.,1510963200,,939,4.081081081081081

8018772,4,B0001Z5YW8,I like the books a lot but didn't want to spend $200 for them so I bought this to balance. The quality for the recording of that time period is good enough. Remember it does not play in a typical US dvd player but will play fine in any computer/laptop,1464998400,,251,4.04
8018773,5,B0001Z5YW8,This was my very first purchase on Amazon and it is the 75th Anniversary Special Edition! It has all 21 of Tintin's adventures - the complete set of books sown on the back of all TinTins books. There are 10 DVDs in total with each containing 2 adventurers and one containing 3. Each DVD case has the covers of the Books on it on each side. The DVDs are nice and slim and all fit nicely into the Blue Case provided - which looks great on any DVD / Book shelf. A must for any Tintin fan.,1387152000,,485,4.010309278350515
8018774,3,B0001Z5YW8,"I am terribly disappointed to know that these aren't with all the languages I am looking for!
I've gotten tired of looking for one set that includes English,French and Spanish(Latin America) audios with their subtitles of course!

I remember the first time I saw Tintin was in Spanish,as it is my native language. Later I got the chance to watch it in English and in French. So far, I can't find a place where I can buy Tintin's episodes like people in Latin America have heard them! :S It's absolutely frustrating! The majority of people that speak Spanish don't can't hv the option to buy it with the audio they're acccustomed to... Only Spain has the privilege. I guess there should be an edition for America. After all, our continent has people speaking English,French and Spanish (not with the Spaniard accent thx u)",1309737600,5,821,4.741258741258742

8018776,2,B0001Z5YW8,"I have been a Tintin fan for many years. So, when I saw this DVD version, I eagerly ordered it. Well, the drawings are true to the comic book version, which is great. However, I was disappointed with a few things:
The stories have been cut - in each episode, many of the original scenes have been left out - very disappointing.
Seeing as this was made in Canada, I was disappointed to find that there were no French subtitles - in fact, no subtitles at all
In my years of reading the original Tintin comics, Tintin had a European accent (in my mind, seeing as he is a European character), but in this series, he has a Canadian accent, which I find rather irritating (not the Canadian accent per se, but the fact that we have a European character speaking with a Canadian accent). Tintin says things like ""sawry"" and ""aboot"" instead of ""sorry"" and ""about"" - well, other viewers might consider this to be minor, but this is my review after all, so sawry aboot that.",1296432000,4,963,4.415730337078652

8018778,1,B0001Z5YW8,"CAN'T VIEW THESE DVD's SINCE IT HAS A MESSAGE ""WRONG REGION"" ON THE SCREEN!!!!! I HAVE TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT FOR A REFUND BUT CAN'T BECAUSE THERE WERE NO RETURN INSTRUCTION LABELS INSIDE THE PACKAGE WHEN I RECEIVED IT!
AMAZON DID NOT INDICATE ANYWERE WHEN I PURCHASED TO CHECK DVDs FOR ""CORRECT REGION"". I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS SO WHY WOULD I LOOK FOR IT?
I NEED SOMEONE TO EMAIL ME HOW TO RETURN THIS SET FOR A REFUND!",1285718400,,423,4.3
8018779,5,B0001Z5YW8,"I'm a big fan of the Tintin books and enjoy this animated series as well.  Originally produced in Canada (and broadcast a while back on HBO), it's a faithful rendering of the exciting and funny adventures of the boy reporter, his dog Snowy, and his friends Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Thompson and Thomson et al.  What I especially like about the series is that they devote two episodes (40+ minutes) to each story, which really lets them capture the spirit of the books.  The rare exceptions are the one-episode stories (e.g., Red Rackham's Treasure), which feel rushed.  If you're new to Tintin, I might start with The Black Island, which is one of the earlier adventures and stands up well by itself.  Note also that this series is generally unavailable on DVD in the U.S. unless you buy it from a third-party seller (not Amazon).",1202601600,3,842,4.779310344827586
