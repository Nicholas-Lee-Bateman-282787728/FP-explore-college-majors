2175246,4,B00068CUOU,"The stories are pretty good, but the set lacks the intros by the series creators seen in the ghosts and ufo's sets. Some stories don't fit, like ""Epilepsy Dogs"", ""Incredible Journeys,"" and ""The Bible Code."" ""After Death Visits"" was more of a ghost story. I  also remember a sequel to ""Reincarnation,"" which didn't make it onto here. Also on a disc 1 segment, the word ""psychiatrist"" is spelled incorrectly. There was a very good story about a psychic teenage girl which appears in montages but was not in the set. But it is overall pretty good, the best segments being ""James van Praagh,"" and ""Rainboy.""",1152230400,2,603,4.742857142857143

8040154,4,B00068CUOU,"Not my favorite topic, but the Rainboy case makes this worth it. A truly baffling story which seems credible due to so many eyewitnesses including Police and the Chief of the Dept. It's the story of young guy who basically could make rain/water drop and trickle from the ceiling or streak across a room while he was in it. I know, sounds laughable right? You just have to see the segment to believe it though. And I do for some reason. I saw a quick interview that was taken recently with the Chief who was there and he still can't explain it. He thought it was a plumbing issue at first until water hit his glasses horizontallly. None of these people have anything to gain either, only looking stupid for telling what they saw so I don't see why they would lie. Even a priest came in and witnessed the ordeal, saying it had to be a spirit/devil doing it inside the boy. This is what Unsolved Mysteries is all about.",1429228800,,916,4.362573099415204

8040158,3,B00068CUOU,I have seen many TV programs about this psychic abilities.  I must say that I am skeptical about the method and the type of psychic ability that these psychics profess to have. What is psychic ability anyhow?  Is psychic ability the divination of information using supernatural methods or is it the ability to foresee events in the real world?  I am still a skeptic about this ability and this set of DVD's claims that some psychics can solve crimes with their abilities and others can prevent bad events from taking place.,1296086400,,523,4.725274725274725
