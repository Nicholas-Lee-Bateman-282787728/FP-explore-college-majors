8248039,4,B0012X5T5U,"Certainly, many people think that this video is ""religious"" because of Dugdale's strong religous beliefs. Some even find the opening song offensive. I say, get over it. We know he is religious - it shouldn't matter. He's trying to raise two daughters, a family, and still compete in professional bodybuilding.

As for the video, I gave it four stars because I thought the video dragged a little as it covered many of the family events. But the training parts were very good. Would have loved to see more posing clips/hints.",1235001600,2,523,4.811111111111111
8248040,5,B0012X5T5U,"I throughly enjoyed Mark's first DVD. It gives a great insight, to what bodybuilding is all about. It shows how Mark is a VERY successfull, family man, father, business man, pro bodybuilder, and a born again Christian, as well.
Mark NEVER force feeds you his faith. He shares what God has done for him, which is what Christanity is all about.
His kids are adorable as well. Now I know why Christina is called 3 girls mom !!
Over all, a 5 * DVd.
His Beyond Driven, is even better,

8248041,1,B0012X5T5U,"If you enjoy DVDs by Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, Dorian Yates and Kevin Levorne then you will not like this DVD. If you are a fan of boring bodybuilders preaching about Christianity while weight lifting with zero intensity than this is the DVD for you. In the IFBB world you don't hear much about Mark Dugdale but when you watch this DVD you'll see why. He has an awesome physique which is very well proportionate but his personality is booooooooooooooooring! He gets a little preachy in this DVD and that's a big turn off. I didn't buy this DVD to get a church sermon. I can go to church for that. Ronnie Coleman is a very religious man but he never preach his faith to his bodybuilding fans. Mark goes overboard with it.

I also found myself fast forwarding through his workouts. If you want to see Mark REALLY workout then buy ""A Week In The Dungeon"" where he is being trained by Dorian Yates. That is the only time you will see Mark GET PUMPED! But in this video it's a snoozefest.

The most interesting part of this video was when he and his entire family go to the Mr Olympia competition. Mark wanted to show the viewers that you can be a father, husband and successful bodybuilder at the Mr Olympia Competition. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. I don't want to give the ending away but let's just say that ALL BODYBUILDERS competing for a competition should stay away from children at least one week out. A preventable illness in which he could have avoided caused Mark to suffer in his placing at the ""O"".

The only great thing about this video is that it is professionally done. Excellent editing and producing. Top notch work but the content leaves much to be desired.

If you are a Mark Dugdale fan and you want to see him at his best without all the Christianity preaching and music then buy ""A week in the dungeon"". You will thank me later.",1214524800,,1861,4.464705882352941
