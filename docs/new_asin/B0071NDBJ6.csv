As with most Japanese films you have to pay attention to who is who, but it's well worth the effort.",1397347200,,245,4.568181818181818
8508524,5,B0071NDBJ6,"I think this movie was interesting, set at the end of the shogunate, leading towards modern Japan.  Story of revenge and how Japanese culture and westernization meshed to lead to the verdict of the victim/hero.  Don't want to give too much away if you haven't watched it.  The only thing is that these movies from overseas seem like they're copied right off the TV sometimes with commercials in them lol.  Still this copy is pretty good, and for the price is worth it.",1363996800,,468,4.602409638554217
