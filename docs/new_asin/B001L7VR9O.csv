I had seen this gig on TV with superb quality, but this one is aparently a copy of another copy. Like a real player download from youtube!!! Terrible quality. I'm really unhappy about this. Never buy unofficial U2 concerts!!!!",1357084800,3,363,4.6875
8317507,5,B001L7VR9O,"This is a great video of the olden days.  Pretty funny hearing the rough back ups on Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Now we know why Adam doesn't sing anymore!  Larry is beautiful, as always, and Bono ROCKS!  Edge shows his talent and style. This DVD is full of energy, and its amazing to watch the band when they were so young, but so full of power.",1264377600,6,341,4.2
