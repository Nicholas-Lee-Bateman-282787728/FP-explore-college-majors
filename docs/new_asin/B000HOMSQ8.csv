8140648,5,B000HOMSQ8,Great film!,1524787200,,11,5.0
8140649,4,B000HOMSQ8,"I have not the faintest idea what it is like to have a broken pelvis, but quite frankly: I don't give a damn. :-) For me irrealistic turns of stories like the protagonist who 'coincidentally' meets the love of his/her life again (this happens so often in stories!) are more annoying than magic (in that case you know what you can expect) or scientific incongruences.
I assume it must have been quite cheap to shoot this film (no special scenery, no special acting skills needed), the idea of focusing on a guy's penis throughout the film is quite original, and above all: you don't fall asleep 'because the story sucks'!
Franco Trentalance's film is not a big masterpiece, but it's entertaining enough for a nice evening behind one's television screen.",1398556800,,752,4.792307692307692
8140650,5,B000HOMSQ8,This movie is quirky fun! The whole film is a crotch shot with dialogue. Hilarious! Not at all what I had expected but wonderful! I am so glad that I made this purchase.,1325116800,,169,4.151515151515151
8140651,4,B000HOMSQ8,"This is an amusing comedy which doesn't outstay it's welcome. Bascially you need to be willing to watch a penis on screen for about 10 minutes of this 76 minute movie. Appeals to some. It's not erotic at all, just funny and undemanding! Better than some of the shite that hollywood produces nowadays!",1274659200,3,300,4.679245283018868
8140652,3,B000HOMSQ8,"Yes, the star of the film is men's most valued body part..., no offence or praise here, it's to the protagonist's male sexual organ this comedy directs its homage. The main character is a writer and talks all the time but we only see his face in the end of the film. He's bored on a bed due to a fractured pelvis (if it were true, he could not move himself...) and tries to have some fun. So, a lot of situations happen but always focused in the same environment. It's not for every one but can be seen by adult audiences and it is not totally boring...of course.",1218240000,,563,4.174311926605505
8140653,1,B000HOMSQ8,"Before buying this DVD, I read descriptions for it and they were generally favorable.  But after viewing part of the DVD, I felt those descriptions were misleading and I suspect they were probably written by the producers of it to encourage more sales.  The premise is interesting, but poorly executed.  The man who is the central character is obviously an older, pudgy guy who naturally makes you wonder why women would be so eager to have sex with him.  And there was NOTHING impressive about his member!",1186876800,2,506,4.781609195402299
8140654,2,B000HOMSQ8,"The most difficult part of reviewing this film is admitting that I purchased it, followed by the admission that I actually sat through it without ejecting the disc and tossing it straight in the garbage.

The plot is simple.  An over-sexed, boring, narcissistic, male chauvinist named Francesco ""Ciccio"" Morelli has fractured his pelvis.  (Note #1 to the producers and screenwriter: a pelvic fracture is extremely serious, painful and potentially life threatening.  It is normally difficult for a man with a pelvic fracture to move at all, let alone have an endless succession of naked women engage in sexual coitus with him while seated in his lap).

In order to monitor his home convalescence, Ciccio's doctors have placed a video camera at the foot of his bed.  Through this camera, which is continuously trained on his [...], the audience experiences the limited visuals offered by this film.  We never see the lead actor's face until the very end, and then, only in a long shot.  We do get brief glimpses of the faces of two female characters who stop by to have oral sex with him (Note #2 to the producers and screenwriter: a man with a fractured pelvis is generally unable to engage in any sexual congress whatever, and is usually in too much pain to even think about sex, let alone desire or engage in it every five or ten minutes, as the lead character in this film does).

The plot revolves around the fact that Ciccio sustained his injury while having an argument with his girlfriend.  He fell on some rocks on the beach, and passed out; his girlfriend has not been heard from since.  The police, who are among the dozen or so visitors he has during the 76 minutes of ""real time"" in which the film takes place, have assumed that he has murdered her, and they arrive to question him, not once, not twice, but three times during the proceedings (none of his interrogators, the main one being female, have sex with him; yet they keep coming back).  One of the most absurd aspects of the plot was that, throughout his interrogation, Ciccio seems completely unconcerned with the disappearance of his girlfriend, and equally unconcerned about being the center of suspicion by the police investigating her fate.  Instead, he spends 100% of his time either wooing women on the phone and trying to get them to come over, or contemplating sex while scrutinizing his phone book, or trying to get an endless succession of female visitors into bed with him.  The result is surreal, and not very amusing.

In fact, it is difficult to pinpoint the most unsatisfying aspect of this film.  The pace is boring and surprisingly un-erotic.  The dialogue is ridiculous, the characters unappealing and the proceedings decidedly unfunny.

To make matters worse, I made the mistake of watching the film with the English dubbing turned on, instead of letting it run in the original Italian.  Since I am slightly hard of hearing, I also had the subtitles on, as I usually do.  The actors who read the English script were so bad that the words they were reading seemed to have almost no correlation to the action at all, while the English script was so badly written that the spoken words failed to match the subtitles in most places.

The gimmick, of course, is that the ""comedy"" is an excuse for us to stare at what is supposed to be a particularly attractive penis for 76 minutes.  This was one of the biggest (if I can use that word) disappointments to me - I was vastly unimpressed.

Don't bother.",1167782400,22,3486,4.70675453047776
8140655,1,B000HOMSQ8,"This ""Movie"" drug on and on. Yes the title character looks great, but so not worth the time it took to watch the DVD. Maybe if I had put the TV on mite or watched it in Italian with subtitles off it would have been more entertaining.",1167091200,3,233,3.978723404255319
