I haven't seen a good action and drama movie like this for a long time.

- The dialogues are funny in many scenes.

- The acting is fascinating. It keeps me watching and watching till the end. There's no moment of boredom.

- The action is non-stop. It's a bloody and violent film.

- It convincingly portrays the danger of steroids.

- It credibly shows the deadly downside of doing business with gangsters. When something goes wrong, i.e. some cocaine goes missing, they will blame it on you. They'll never listen to your reason. They'll kill you to make an example for others. There's truly no honor among thieves.",1236816000,18,643,4.5964912280701755

3512739,4,B001CHG05E,"This is certainly an extremely brutal film, but not the most violent I have ever seen. I only mention this because other member reviews have suggest that this movie is one of the most brutal films ever made. Well I agree to some extent because it is extremely violent but not in as unsettling a way as perhaps some moments from other Mafia movies, such as the brutal beating by baseball bats of Nicky Santori and his gang near the end of Casino, which remains one of the most brutally unsettling mob murders ever seen in cinema. But what interests me more is the fact this this is truly a superbly crafted film that by all rights should receive considerable praise for its great acting, solid production values, excellent script and great direction. It does shamelessly borrow techniques that worked for Scorsese where his mob films are concerned. For example the ever present commentary given by the lead character, Ricchi Harnett, who by the way is simply astonishing and powerful in the role of the mob kingpin and central character. Hes simply brilliant and just wonderful in this role. He also kept reminding me of sort of a british version of Benicio Del Toro. His role is just great and I couldn't help but take serious notice of this actor, because hes a solid actor all the way, as were most of the the actors who played members of his criminal organization. I felt this film comes close to being considered an instant classic, but there are moments when it falls just a little short of measuring up to an american mafia movie. Still this film was a great experience. Harrowingly violent and brutally realistic. This is deffinatley going to be considered a classic by some and and an major disapointment by others.

3512743,3,B001CHG05E,"I titled this a game of two halves, not just because it starts off as a movie about a football hooligan who ventures into gangland crime but because it is a movie that goes off on a tangent without any real rhyme or reason.

As I said it starts off as a movie about football violence, which centres on the younger life of Carlton Leach (played by Ricci Harnett) who was a member of West Ham Utd's infamous I.C.F crew or to give it its proper title 'The Inter City Firm'.

We are treated to a few 'tear ups' between West Ham and Fulham and West Ham and Arsenal. Also included are two legendary stories of fights between West Ham and Millwall on the underground and West Ham and Manchester Utd in a rough Manchester suburb.

I know of these stories as I have read a number of books on them and the stories in the movie ring true. In Cass Pennants 'Cass' and another of his books 'Congratulations You Have Just Met the Famous I.C.F', the same stories appear. In many of the other books about the I.C.F, they also get a mention.

The movie does make a point of mentioning Bill Gardner, who was the self-confessed leader of the original West Ham Utd mob and later the I.C.F. For some reason he is portrayed in the movie like a bloke from a seventies soft porn movie, which I am sure many of the former I.C.F lads had a good laugh at when they saw it. I bet Bill wasn't too pleased though.

As you would expect of a British movie about hooliganism and organised crime, this film features most of the genre actors who most of you will be familiar with.

The movie is essentially about Carlton leach but the bigger plot line is about the deaths of Anthony Tucker, Patrick Tate and Craig Rolfe, who were murdered in a Range Rover in Workhouse Lane, Rettenden, Essex on 6th December 1995. On 20th January 1998 Jack Whomes and Michael Steele were found guilty of their murders and sentenced to triple-life sentences, one for each of the murders. They protest their innocence to this day. They were found guilty because of a witness statement by Darren Nichols. Nichols is now living under witness protection and has never been tracked down. He was a thief and a known liar as well as a self-confessed teller of tall tales. Whomes and Steele say he lied about them being the ones who murdered the three men and many people believe them to be innocent. Perhaps we will never know the real story and the only ones who could tell the truth are the three dead men. Carlton Leach was best friends with Anthony Tucker.

My only criticism is that when it turns into the story about the three murder victims that Carlton Leach is swept aside and after being the lead for most of the movie you almost feels like he has been ditched and another movie has started. Once it gets into the story about the three murdered men it is Ok but it really does take the long route to get there and doesn't focus on the characters enough for you to care enough about them or what happens to them.

That aside, this is a well-made movie, with some good acting performances. The direction is assured and the cinematography crisp. It is just a shame that the way the script has been structured made it hard, for me at least, to feel like I could invest too much in it.

----

The Premise

----

The film follows Carlton Leach who rose from a teenager fighting on the terraces at Upton Park to one of the most feared generals of the football terraces before becoming a member of a notorious gang of criminals who bullied their way through London and Essex in the late eighties and early nineties. Leach was feared on the terraces and when the laws were tightened he got into the bouncing game. He would run protection for drug deals, making sure they were carried out without a hitch. This led to him running raves and all-nighters as a way of raking in the money before eventually moving onto heavier drugs himself and mixing with more hardened criminals. The story reflects on three decades of Leach's life and culminates in the murder of one of best friends and two of his associates.

----

My Thoughts

----

I have already touched on my general feelings about the movie so here I will talk about some of the acting and actors involved and the director, Julian Gilbey.

Gilbey is known for 'Rolling With the Nines' and 'Doghouse'. I watched Doghouse a few nights ago and can't even bring myself to review it, it was that bad. Saying that though, I did enjoy his latest film 'A Lonely Place to Die'. Gilbey does have a very distinct style of direction and I must say that he knows what he is doing. The direction on this movie belies the fact that he has only made a few films. He is however, a Bafta winning director for his movie direction on 'Rolling With the Nines' and is also an editor and screen writer.

This is due in no small way to the cinematography of Ali Hasad who also worked on Doghouse and SA Lonely Place to Die.

The film does pace nicely until the switch in story when it becomes a bit mish-mashed and leaves you wondering who you are supposed to be following now.

The films budget was four million and it only managed to recoup one hundred and seventy thousand at the box office, with over half that being in the opening weekend.

The soundtrack to the movie is rather good and I wouldn't mind picking it up on the cheap. It features some great British bands and some great music including 'Sham 69', whom, if you are a West Ham fan, you will know are big Hammers fans. 'The Groundhogs', 'The River' and 'Guy Called Gerald' also feature. The original score by Sandy McClelland and Ross Cullum is also available across the net and in all good record shops on the River Media Group label. It contains twenty-five tracks and a bonus track.

Ricci Harnett plays Carlton Leach and he plays it well, although the narration did grate on me a little after a while as the cockney slang expletive grew a little tiring.
The film opens with said narration with the lines 'It was the end of an era. But before the murders, the torture, the beatings and the ecstasy... before all of that, there was football. You see, football was where all the spite and the hatred first came from. On those terraces... well, it's where it all began for me.'

Most of these actors have starred in a handful of these British genre films and Harnett is no different. He played a cop in 'The Rise of the White Collar Hooligan' and he is probably most famous for his role in '28 days Later' as 'Mitchell'.

Billy Murray makes his umpteenth gang member appearance. You will know him from his days in Eastenders as Johnny Allen (as a gangster of course) and from his earlier career as Don Beech in ITV's 'The Bill'. He plays Michael Steele, one of the accused murderers in the film.

Craig Fairbrass is an actor I have never took to, or to be fairer an actor whose characters I have never liked. That must be a certain testament to his skill as you are not meant to like most of the characters I have played. He didn't disappoint me in this as I hated him. He played one of the gangsters who are eventually murdered, Patrick Tate and if he was anything like Fairbrass' portrayal of him then I would've give him a wide berth.

Frank Harper, who has starred in numerous hooligan movies makes an appearance again as Jack Whomes, one of the men accused of murder. It is quite a played-down role for Harper who is usually the mouthy cockney at the forefront of most gangs.

Neil Maskell has broken into this group of actors over the last few years and has starred in 'Kill List' and played small parts in many other movies in this genre. I must admit I am not really a fan of his either but fair play to him for breaking into acting.

Roland Manookian is another who has been in a handful of films across the genre and he plays Craig Rolfe, who was the third murder victim.

Overall I would recommend it to fans of the genre but as a film to watch for entertainment I would suggest that mainstream viewers would find it a hard slog. It is a violent movie and is an eighteen certificate due to strong bloody/brutal violence, torture and language throughout, drug use, sexuality, and some graphic nudity.
Carlton Leach is no longer an active gang member and is no longer involved in violence of any nature. However, His twitter profile name contains the letters I.C.F so it would seem the I.C.F was something he was proud of.

The 2 Disc edition DVD can be brought from many sites on the internet for between two and nine pounds and includes Special Features of deleted scenes, feature commentaries and interviews with cast and crew.

I would rate the movie three out of five stars.

3512744,2,B001CHG05E,"I found the main protagonist, and almost all the other characters, so unlikeable that it was hard to get into the film. I couldn't feel any empathy toward Carlton or care about what happened to him. It's the story of a large brutish thug who grows to become... a larger, more brutish thug. And there's really not much of a compelling story here, the conflict seems there only to set-piece moments of violence. There's no growth with these people, no one learns anything. It's kind of like watching a documentary about someone horrible, but with no narrator to provide subtext or to dig for deeper meaning you're left with watching this horrible guy do horrible things for two hours, which gets pretty boring.",1343347200,,708,4.764227642276423
3512745,5,B001CHG05E,"Of all the genres of movies I enjoy, there are few more enticing to me than crime stories. This is a superbly directed, intensely shot, and movingly performed rise and fall story of a famous British ""gangster"". Part bio-pic, part crime story, the tale of Carlton Leach is an interesting story that shows the violence and the grit of his criminal activities. It also does not shy away from the cruelty used in the criminal world which makes it that much more compelling to watch. I have also read Carlton Leach's autobiography, which indicates that this movie is surprisingly accurate. It is not true to the last detail but it is far more true than one would guess otherwise.

3512749,3,B001CHG05E,"Rise of the Footsoldier was a recomended film to see and so I went ahead and decided to give it a go at watching. This is your basic biographical tale of the path of violence the main character decided to take, and it is a dark downward spiral of someone who's greed and need for dishing out pain to those in the underworld of England.

There is nothing to like about the characters,they aren't depicted as ""good folk"" and rightly so. Basically (in his younger days) he was a dousche bag and his choice of friends weren't much different than he was. He was a drug user and a heavy anabolic steroid user and to top things off,left little to his already unstable personality and temperment.

Rise of the Footsolder makes no apologies in its telling of the life of a self proclaimed ""hooligan"" and later as a full flegged gangster. I liked the true,raw depiction of events and characters (be it based on some factual events).You don't like the chasracters, and as the film continues you like them less. There is really no one to care or root for in this story, just to watch as a spectator at a soccer match to see who the last man standing is at the end.

While I knew what it was I was getting myself into whatching Rise of the Footsoldier, it lacked some originality in the way the screenplay  ans story telling went. It wasn't boring, but much of the story telling is a carbon copy of Guy Ritchie and Martin Scorse films in both the telling and graphic violence. Nothing new or fresh here.

I think these were very difficult parts for any actor to portray,an indiviudual who lives for violence and is abusive in nature while feeding his own addictions to both drugs and power. The other ""slight"" problem I had was the constant swearing from begining to end.

I suppose that kind of dialog was to make it that much more autehtic and real,but I grew tired of everyone throwing the words S^!@?&!, f&%^@#% and c&%!#% around constantly. I spent some time in the UK and not one person I new over there (including family) cursed as much as these individuals did.

Lastly were the accents,but this is really more on me. The slang and heavy Essex accents garbled together with shouting and arguing sounds like someone taking with a mouthfull of food to me. I was considering the use of the ""closed caption"" function to follow some of the conversations as occasionally I was lost with what they were specifically talking about.

All in all, what you have here is a stylized biographgy of one man's experience  as a brawler,to gangster and drug dealer. How much ""legend"" he is I don't know as I am unfamiliar with the story, and underworld culture of the UK. Its not too different than anywhere else, so aside from a gang land assasination there are the similarities there.

It's not a ""perfect film"" and since it copied so much from Guy Ritchie and heavily from Martin Scorse and other gangster films. This isn't Essex Boys, Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Guns, and is a far cry from Scoses's masterpiece Goodfellas,although it trys hard to be. In attempting to copycat those films in some way,it hurt this film's potential to stand on its own in my opinion. It is still watchable if you can get past the disturbing bits and unwanten cruelty and violence,but that is the life of a gangster,no apologies.",1290211200,5,3290,4.561016949152543

8287695,4,B001CHG05E,"The Rise of the Footsoldier is a violent and often graphically violent look at the seamier side of England.

Starting as a football hooligan in his youth and rising up the top of his game, Carlton 'Carl' Leach's story is portrayed by Ricci Garnett.  Together with Tony Tucker (Terry Stone) and Pat Tate (Craig Fairbass), the three rise from obscurity to game changers.

This is a very violent, bloody and no holds barred look into the life, complete with drugs, torture, sex and friendship and family.  The acting is quite good and subtitles needed for some of the more ""deep accented"" moments.  This is not a family film.",1471046400,,622,4.722222222222222

8287698,5,B001CHG05E,"I guess this would fall under the category of ""Violent Docu-Drama"" based on real life events of a Soccer Hooligan's rise in the UK Mafia---similar to The USA themed Goodfellas story.  It's a great movie and I only found out about it through friends at work.  If your are a fan of Tom Hardy in the movie, ""The Krays"" (about UK organized crime in the late 1960's), then you will like Rise of the Foot Soldier.  I don't want to give away story line or plot----just take my word that it is worth watching and the acting is excellent.  This movie should have been waaaaaay more popular in the USA.",1461542400,,592,4.3545454545454545
