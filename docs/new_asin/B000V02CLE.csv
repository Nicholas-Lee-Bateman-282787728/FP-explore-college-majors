It's hard to sit through, it feels pretty clinical. There are some rare clips, and it is a really good doccument of ape movies.",1322611200,,254,4.3125
8215938,4,B000V02CLE,"I owned both of these documentaries on VHS at one time and I was happy to find them on this DVD. The transfers are straight from VHS but, thats not all that big a deal since most of the footage is from old trailers etc. There is some good rare stuff on here for vintage fans of giant monster movies and an extra documentary is included. I guess for $12.99, 4 hours of fun isn't too bad a deal. I rate this 3 1/2 stars.",1200355200,6,418,3.929411764705882
8215939,4,B000V02CLE,"Two interesting documentaries from the 80s (including cheesy graphics and worse acting) but showing the development of the dinosaur and giant ape in movies. The Dinosaur one is superior, but both are interesting for any students of film. And all this predates computer-generated graphics, so it's quite primitive by today's standards.",1200009600,2,334,5.568627450980392
