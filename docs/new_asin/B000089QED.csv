7980786,5,B000089QED,"This is a live concert set from underappeciated Canadian singer/songwriter Amanda Marshall.  She has an amazing voice, both soulful and powerful, great backing band and a knack for evocative song writing.  Apparently, like John Fogerty, she's now spent years tied up in a management/legal dispute which has prevented her from recording.  Rumor has it that may be at an end and new material is on the way.  I hope so.",1357171200,4,416,4.9

i agree with everything the only other person said.
i've been a fan of amandas since the start.

i listen to alot of different types of music but i always keep going back to amandas music and it brings back alot of memories for me. especially after seeing her live in 2002.
everyone needs to hear her incredible talent because i think she could heal alot of people with her music and incredible voice.",1121558400,,617,4.421052631578948
7980789,5,B000089QED,"amazing, fantastic, stunning, outstanding, phenomenal! These words don't even begin to describe Amanda and her talent! She truly is the greatest artist with the most incredible voice! No doubt about that!
She always has an amazing amount of energy when she performs and that's exciting to see. Her little dances are awesome too! I love them!! They just add to the greatness of the whole show. She just goes all out while performing, and never seems to get tired.. i don't know how she does it! (and in those heels too! :) )
Everything she's done so far has been incredible! I'm hoping this won't be the only dvd we get from her. I'm still waiting for one that has all her music videos, interviews, tv appearances, etc.. that she's done since the beginning. Now THAT would be an excellent dvd!! :)
I got this dvd the first day it came out, and i've watched it so many times since then! I love it! It's filled with a lot of really cool stuff. Not only do you get the amazing concert, but you get to see the making of her last 2 videos, EGAS and SMA. And there are also some other various performances and interviews that she did while promoting the new album, plus a lot more.
This is something that everyone SHOULD have! Even if you're not that big of a fan, then you should really check this out,  and i'm sure that you'll be a fan afterwards.. she's just THAT great! Her live performances are beyond words! You will be blown away!! I know i am, everytime i see her. She never ceases to amaze me! And if you're a fan already, then this is something you need to add to your collection for sure! (You should have it by now tho.. ;) )
I will be a fan of hers for life! Never stop making music Amanda! You are a rare talent! And everyone that doesn't know about you is definately missing out!",1076198400,2,1788,4.3056379821958455
