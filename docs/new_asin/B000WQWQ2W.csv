8225205,2,B000WQWQ2W,"The technical aspects covered and film footage were first rate. However, the whole experience was bad in that the obnoxious background noise (I'm being very charitable here) was so distracting that I couldn't concentrate on what was being said. I'm not kidding! I don't mind a little music intro but this was absurd and had no place or purpose other than to distract from the oral narrative. I know this isn't supposed to be like a conversation in my living room but still, if someone is trying to explain the intricacies of the tires being use in MotoGp then why in the hell do you have to put up with someone who sounds as if he's pounding on a garbage can lid with a baseball bat? This was not an isolated problem. It occurs throughout the DVD. The same criticism applies to the 2007 MotoGP Official Review DVD that I purchased at the same time.",1198195200,8,848,4.47741935483871
