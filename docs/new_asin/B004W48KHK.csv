4485088,5,B004W48KHK,"I am not the biggest fan of the horror genre because of the lack brains (other than those that ooze) the genre displays... but that's where YBR takes off.  It's a very smart movie that is actively trying to mess with your head.  You feel like you are descending into the same madness that characters are.  Part 'out in the woods horror' and part David Lynch, YellowBrickRoad has some murder and gore, but it really gets you with its brains.

The ensemble cast is quite strong.  In general the quality of this production outpaces what seems to be a fairly low budget.  It doesn't try to pull of things that a low budget horror movie couldn't pull off.  It reminds me of classic horror in that what it shows you is messed up, but what it doesn't show you is what is most frightening.

Fantastic stuff.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this in the theater and preordered it on here as soon as I noticed it.  Any fans of smart horror or lynchian mindbenders would be smart to check this out.",1312156800,9,993,4.377049180327869

4485092,4,B004W48KHK,"The movie starts out as a black and white documentary about an incident in 1940 where a village/town of people all take off walking down a trail. Only one person survived and he was a bit crazy. Bodies were found along the trail, many more missing.

Years later Teddy Barnes, teacher and writer (Michael Laurino) manages to obtain the records and decides to investigate in order to publish a book. The team goes to the co-ordinates of the trail head only to find a movie theater. Teddy decides to go into the theater and talk to the counter girl/projectionist who tells him a bizarre tale of how the original Oz movie was playing at the time of the incident. She (Laura Heisler) is over eager to help them go down the Yellow Brick Road, a sign that marks the trial.

She takes them to the trail. There is a psychologist(Alex Draper) on the trip who is constantly filming individuals and asking them questions as a sanity check. This gives the movie the annoying feel of those reality type movies. Also in the team is his wife Melissa (Anessa Ramsey) and Daryl and Erin Luger (Clark Freeman and Cassidy Freeman). Cy (Sam Elmore) and Jill (Tara Giordano) round out the team as they head on down the trail laced with belladonna. The movie develops slowly as small things happen. Daryl finds a hat that is from the era, but seems new. Jill's GPS goes haywire, one minute they are in Guam, the next Italy. They joke about it.

They hike for five days in Northern NH (is that possible?) and they come to a field (poppies?) and they hear music. Their instruments are not working properly and they know something is at work, but what? They speculate: Solar flares? Earth magnetism? Government experiment? The music becomes addicting. Emotions flare...

Good acting. Nice New England accent by Laura Heisler. I enjoy horror/mystery/thrillers and this one was exceptionally good, even though the ending didn't offer an explanation as to the events.

4485095,5,B004W48KHK,"The top reviews for this movie are already well entrenched, so if you're reading these words it's because you still haven't made up your mind about YellowBrickRoad.  Well, as the litany of ~other~ other reviews will show, you are not alone in that regard: this is something of a polarizing film.  This not ""horror"" in the sense that modern audiences expect, nor is this a witty satire/tribute to the genre.  Words you'll often find associated with YBR include ""unsettling"", ""artsy"", ""indie"", ""unnerving"", and ""dark"" on the positive side, ""confusing"", ""boring"", ""pointless"", and ""stupid"" on the negative.  Depending on your own tastes in pictures, any or all of those could be correct.

If you're unsure about whether this is the film for you, take this simple litmus test first: Which movie do you enjoy more, Friday the 13th or The Shining?  If you answered ""Friday the 13th"", then you might not like this one.  If you're more into the slow build of tension and the unsettling feeling that comes from seeing completely ordinary people, the kind you associate with every day (or even the kind you are), descend into murderous madness a'la The Shining, then you should probably press the ""play"" button above.  Just be forewarned that this film ~will~ stick with you for days after watching it, it ~will~ make you want to analyze it with others who've seen it, and you ~will~ second-guess almost everything you thought you'd figured out when you watch it again.  And yes, you will watch it again, despite an ending that's a bit of a let-down from any angle.

YellowBrickRoad is, in my opinion, among the rarest of gems in the modern motion picture industry: a flick that drags its audience along with its protagonists and raises the sort of questions that cannot be answered with a blanket ""this is what happened"".  It will make you think, and in as much as any film can for the kind of jaded audiences which watch them in the 21st century, it will lead you along the same path those characters take.  Very highly recommended by this jaded horror aficionado.",1483747200,,2056,4.793201133144476

I was impressed with the movie over-all.  Strange people on a strange mission.  Years ago in the movie, all of a small town followed a trail north.  People said they could hear the music from the ""Wizard of Oz"" sound track and were following the yellow brick road's music to where it went.  It didn't work out well for the disappeared folks from the town, or for the explorers following in their footsteps.  As a null spot movie viewer, you and I get to hear the muffled Wizard of Oz music and it is disquieting to say the least.  I think the producers use that ultra low frequency vibration that makes we humans un-easy because I was that.  Like the Wizard of Oz, this movie tries to have a few metaphors, but they fail short of anything important as our desire to find the phonograph and turn it off gets rudely interrupted by madness and murder.",1461974400,6,1023,4.286458333333333

4485113,4,B004W48KHK,"This is a very creepy, unsettling film. There's no gore to speak of but there is plenty of violence. I know that one of the reviewers keeps saying that this is a ""comedy"", but I strongly disagree with that description. I could find nothing funny about this film at all. It is very dark and disturbing and leaves one with an unsettling and strange feeling, almost bordering on fear.
The movie takes place in New Hampshire where in 1940, the people of the town took a walk on a trail and never made it back. There was only one survivor and he was too ""unwound"" to really tell others what had happened to all of the people. Dead bodies were later discovered on the trail. This is all learned within the first 10-15 minutes of the movie, so it's not going to spoil anything for anyone. Now, in the present, a writer finally gets a chance to tell the story of what exactly happened when he decides to walk the trail, himself, with some other people (about 25) from the town.
The following story is what makes up the film and it raises more questions than answers, in my opinion. The story gets more disturbing as it goes on and I don't want to give anything away, but if you enjoy very creepy, disturbing psychological drama/thrillers, then I think you will enjoy this film. If you just want a good horror movie with lots of gore, this is NOT for you, in any way.",1441929600,11,1358,4.350393700787402

I hope that they'll do further work in this genre.  Very suggestive, rather than over the top or formulaic per contemporary expectations.  More psychological than supernatural.  Not a slasher film although there is some violence as such. The film held my attention though I was occasionally incredulous, like 'WTF is happening here' or 'this plot is not'.

okay. I have tried several times to do this *fantastic* movie justice in a review and I have failed each time. But like an intrepid band of modern-day explorers wandering northward into uncharted wilderness in search of an urban legend, I will keep on ploughing through the thorny underbrush until I get this right.

This is a wonderful puzzle box of a horror movie. It is an art movie that confuses people because everything about it is so brilliantly un-pretentious.

As a young man, fervent about writing great novels one day, I read many a text on how to write well, how to be a better writer, how to write. One book by an author, I think her name was Bly, concocted an unforgettable lesson by having her readers first visualize a sinister meeting of pirates on the high sea on a dark and stormy night. (A bit campy, yes? Fun, overblown, clich, hackneyed, yes?) Now keep everything about the scene exactly the same, only change the weather to brilliant sunlight over a smooth turquoise sea, spread out and glistening in all directions. To me at least, the second scene is far more sinister.

In a sense, this movie is a joke. I noticed that the first time I saw this movie. ""Noticed"" is an understatement. I was laughing my ass off the whole damn movie long, and when I looked afterward at the Amazon reviews, as is my won't, I was shocked, SHOCKED to see that, alongside the many reviews bemoaning that the movie was just too weird or too hard to understand (I expected those. Like I said, this is an art movie, which is kind of a euphemism for ""not for everybody"", which is kind of a euphemism for ""if you don't worship this film for its unique and poignant brilliance, you will despise it as a pretentious piece of crap"",) all the other reviews seemed to paint it as something very grim and unsettling.

Well. As a gentleman critic beset with real life Aspergers, I am obliged in this sort of situation to yield to public consensus. I watched the movie again and again, each time with a set of fresh eyes, until I saw that yes, the actors play it so straight, and the stakes become so high, and the poetry, all the time evoking images from the Wizard of Oz in its Great Depression, of the allure and danger of escapism.

And yet there is something darkly comic about how this truly twisted horror movie (and every time I watch the scarecrow images, SPOILER WARNING, I do think to myself ""you insane Asperger person, how could you NOT have thought this is one of the darkest films ever) is set so brightly against such a bucolic, unthreatening background as the north woods of New Hampshire, all rolling and gentle, never requiring our characters to climb or strain uphill much. And, as our heroes, a munchkin-like lollipop guild (and lollipops are a symbol in this movie, SPOILER WARNING as witness the sad sad suicide of Jill the Intern) of an intern, a ranger, a local informant, two siblings who are together ace at making maps, and three scholars who perhaps are meant to represent one a lion with no courage (the nebbish-y behavioral psychologist Walter Myrick, who dare not mention where his true affections lie) a scarecrow with no brain (for Melissa Barnes, though clearly a brilliant scholar and strong willed fighter, is determined to follow her husband on whatever mad path he dares follow) and a tin woodsman with no heart, no compassion for those who have followed into this fatal wilderness, this dark, thorny poem of demon metaphors which systematically drive all his companions down into an individual hell, and oblivious to the horrors, Teddy Barnes plods forward.

And Dorothy? Maybe hard-bitten Liv McCann. But focus to much on the admittedly brilliant way that this movie turns the world on its head by making a horror movie out of Wizard of Oz, making the charming, carefree ditties of the American 1930s into a haunting and menacing banshee moanreflect too much on all that highfalutin stuff, wonderful as it is, and you miss some of the simple pleasures of this movie. Namely, the fact that this seems to have been one of those rare and wonderful productions where the director was able to say to the actors, ""Why don't your forget about acting and just have a good time."" The camping scenes are so full of tiny little wonderful bits of observational humor about the silly fun that making camping trips worth going on, from having impromptu campfire-building contests, sharing a bag of candy, and joking around at an apparently broken GPS that one minute tells our intrepid campers that they are wandering somewhere in Guam, the next minute that they are outside Florence and next well on their way to Melbourne. Each time poor Jill the Intern is called on to read off the latest ridiculous location, all the rest of the campers cheer like ""Hooray! Florence! Oy! Melbourne! Throw a shrimp on the barbie, mates!"" It's a joy and if you miss that joy you are missing the point of this movie.

But if you let yourself get lulled too deeply into the joy, you'll miss the truth of the metaphor: they HAVE wandered off the map, our intrepid explorers, wandered into a place which is nowhere and everywhere, simultaneously Guam, Melbourne, Florence, the woods north of Friar, NH and the wilderness of the land of Oz itself whose dreamlike brutality (apple trees flinging apples with murderous disregard for suffering, monkey demons with bat wings charging down from the sky, and the unforgettable sight of a green-skinned demon witch bemoaning her fate as she literally melts into oblivion) is indicated by those mighty emerald walls so few are ever allowed to cross.

This is one of those smart movies, the kind that lead me yet again to recall and paraphrase that favorite Zen rubric, ""This film is a mirror. If a monkey looks in, no visionary will look out."" Dismiss this movie as merely ""weird"" ""boring"" or ""meaningless"" at your own peril. It is, at turns, all of those things.

4485156,4,B004W48KHK,"Let's face it: horror gets a bad rep.  And this reputation is entirely deserved at times.  I'm a huge fan of the genre, but I have no trouble admitting this.  It's always been the case; people will often go for the low blow because (get this) other people will completely buy into it.

YELLOW BRICK ROAD (or YELLOWBRICKROAD, a title I love a lot more) is not one of these low-blow films.  In fact, it's pretty high-brow, to a fault by the time the film wraps up.  It winds up in a realm of ""let's just mess with your head because by now we know we can.""  But before the final fifteen or twenty minutes (especially the final scene)?  The film legitimately messes with your head.  It starts slow: a group of curious folk seek to discover what happened to an entire town that just up and vanished, following a fabled path into...nowhere.  Does this path even exist?  What happened to these people?  Those are the questions that need answering (though, in the words of a character during a key scene, they are questions that never needed asking).  But what our adventurers find is something completely beyond their expectations, something almost totally beyond the human experience, a waking nightmare that will lead them to the edge and shove them over the side.

It's a slow-burner, for sure.  In fact, when all hell breaks loose, it's sudden and disturbing.  There are few films I've seen that come back to haunt me; I'm sure YELLOW BRICK ROAD will be popping up in my nightmares at random points during the next couple months.  There is one scene in particular that probably comes down as the most gut-wrenching death scene I've watched, not so much for the gore (there's some, but not much by most comparisons) but more so for the way it's filmed, and the psychological implications.  And therein lies the crux: this is a cerebral horror film.  That'll put off a lot of people, and truth be told, the film becomes TOO cerebral by its end, too caught up in itself.  But when it's right, it's right.  Rooted by realistic, earthy performances, and hefted by some truly disturbing cinematography, YELLOW BRICK ROAD is a horror film to watch, especially if, like me, you tend to prefer your horror films with a little brains behind them.",1382313600,4,2233,4.631043256997455

4485159,3,B004W48KHK,"I felt like this one really had potential to be a really good, creepy horror film. The back-story concerns a village in NH that in 1940 all of it's residents abandoned their homes and hiked up a trail. Many were never seen again and about a third (rough estimate) were either frozen to death or slaughtered, with only one surviving.

70 years later (the present) a team of friends/colleagues venture up the trail for their own investigation, with the intention of writing a book about it - accompanied by a town local that insists on going with them.
After about 5 days of hiking, they soon realize they can't find any possible way out and back to town, and can only keep going on, while insanity starts to take its toll.

Now, this was a bery good, creepy plot and environment, and it definitely has the ""horror"" than a typical slasher flick or one like Paranormal Activity. However, it was the ending that just washed the whole movie down the drain.... the movie ends with MANY questions unanswered. Nothing is ever revealed.

But again, the rest of the movie was quite well done. However if you've already seen films like The Shining or The Blair Witch Project, this is merely an homage/tribute to the former and a slightly better upgrade for the latter, in style of the creepyness and horror.

If you do see this, either already have a rental or streaming service (I viewed this over Netflix' streaming), rent it or borrow a friends copy. It's a good watch maybe once or twice, but I'm not going to re-watch it a hundred times to figure it out.

For instance, when they reach that pile of debre--where'd that scarecrow come from?  Just beyond that pile of debre--what's that receding blue light?

I understand that it's an independent film, written, directed, and starring first timers, but anyone who read this script had to have known it just wouldn't work! Don't get me wrong, the story they had was extremely solid, and they could have taken it in a million different directions, any other direction than the one they took. The story starts 70 years ago, when an entire town randomly decides to follow a path into the woods and are never heard from again. The FBI investigated, covered up whatever they found, and kept the whole area off limits, until a random group of people decide to investigate for themselves and write a book about their experiences. First of all, this group of people have no connection to the town, people, or even each other, so why do this? Second, for 70 years the FBI has kept the area off limits to everyone, so what makes this group so special? These idiots march into the woods and the only thing they find is music playing, music that gets progressively louder until it drives them insane. The music is from the Wizard of Oz, but the producers were too cheap to buy the rights to the music from the Wizard of Oz, so it's very similar melodies with different words that nearly drove me to insanity. These idiots romp through the woods makes the Blair Witch Project look like an Oscar worthy film by comparison. It's a lot of talking, and crying, and yelling, that leads to an ending that is by far one of the dumbest things I have ever seen. The ending is the strangest part of all, in that it builds up and plays like it's some huge twist, which maybe it would have been had it made any sense at all. The acting was terrible, the direction was all over the place, and the film destroys the story worst than Paula Deen destroyed her career.

The initial buildup of creepiness, however, was quickly marred by the highly improbable (first death, I won't spoil but sorry, it was physically *impossible*), the stupid (the first implication of homicidal insanity is apparently due to wearing an old hat; later such happenings aren't explained at all), and the incredibly annoying (the loud music and screeching that pops in at random intervals and is so loud that you have to mute your TV and then can't hear the dialogue).  These things make it impossible to immerse yourself in the movie and pretty much override the creepiness.  I won't spoil the ending, but it's pretty much just senseless confusion.  It's too bad, because the actors aren't bad (that and the initial interesting premise is why I give it any stars at all), but what could have been a really interesting, psychologically intense and creepy indie film unfortunately ends up being an annoying, confusing mess that ends with a whimper instead of a bang.",1364342400,,1211,4.9507389162561575

To be sure, nothing before or after that scene rises to quite the same level of grisly art. For instance, a slower introduction might have allowed us to better connect with the characters -- as it is, I had little invested in them -- and take in certain elements of the back-story that are a little too vague.

I'd rather have experienced a subtly creepy town than have the creepiness squeezed into the lines for the popcorn girl.

The end should have been more richly awful. (The commentary suggests this is what they could afford.)

And the DVD badly needs subtitles, as the sound is woefully under-recorded (or just poorly mixed) in places.

But the film isn't crushed by any of this. Rather, it's a promising first effort and I'm waiting to see what they do next -- and how they can possibly top that landmark scene.",1349308800,2,1091,4.603092783505154

They left behind their clothes, their money, all of their essentials. A US Army Search Party was dispatched there where they eventually discovered the remains of nearly 300 of Friar's evacuees(out of total of 572 people). Many were slaughtered. Many froze to death. All cruelly and mysteriously. No one knows why. The bodies of the remaining are still unaccounted for. Thier fate went for over 70 years unaccounted for. A team of researchers discover the trailhead and attempt to track the path the doomed citizens of Friar took to find out what happend to them. This is the tale of the YellowBrickRoad.

I happend to come across this movie while shopping. What drew me to it, honestly, was the fact that I recognized Cassidy Freeman(whom you all know as Tess from Smallville). Not only that but the asking price for it was pretty reasonable, too. So, I purchase the movie and bring it home. After viewing it, I was left speechless. I couldn't believe this was a Bloody Disgusting Selects movie and it was this good. I've bought a few Bloody Disgusting Selects movies that I was disaapointed with and I figured this one would leave me disappointed as well(Course, on a sidenote, they released Exit Humanity here recently and it was pretty good).

The thing I love most about the movie is how it tends to get under your skin, so to speak. It's creepy and will stay with you long after the movie is over. My biggest gripe with the movie, however, is how it ends. It didn't really give me a sense of closure to the movie. Very little was explained as to why things happend the way they did and I found that disappointing as well as annoying.

I really liked her work in the TV series Smallville (she played the best character in the show in my opinion).  when I found Yellow Brick Road, it sounded interesting enough, and it was set in New Hampshire (the state I live in), so it thought it might be worth a shot.  I was wrong.

minor spoilers...
Just having watched it... sort of (I ended up fast forwarding a lot), I'm sorely disappointed.  Not only was Cassidy Freeman's character the first to die, but it was a ridiculous death.  Entirely ridiculous.  That moment made me not care about any of the rest of it, because it cancelled any of the creepiness the movie had going for it.  Along with the break in tension, of course the only character I cared about seeing any more of was gone... so I started fast forwarding.

bigger spoilers...
Finally... the end makes no sense.  I'm left baffled.  You might say it's because I fast forwarded, but you have people lost in the woods and the big reveal is that the main character guy reaches a sort of haunted movie theater, and he watches a movie with his now dead wife in it that shows the end of the world?  If you told me this was all some kind of psychotic break played out in the imagination of a guy trussed up in a padded room, I'd understand.  But this just feels... weak.  Other reviewers have pointed out the potential this set up had, and how it failed to live up to the potential.  I agree with them.

I'm normally a completionist.  I play video games and have to run all the side quests so that I am sure I know the whole story.  This movie gives me no sense of need to know what happened in the fast forwarded bits.  People went crazy and killed themselves and each other.  And they leave you with no satisfying answer as to why.

The movie starts out as a black and white documentary about an incident in 1940 where a village/town of people all take off walking down a trail. Only one person survived and he was a bit crazy. Bodies were found along the trail, many more missing.

Years later Teddy Barnes, teacher and writer (Michael Laurino) manages to obtain the records and decides to investigate in order to publish a book. The team goes to the co-ordinates of the trail head only to find a movie theater. Teddy decides to go into the theater and talk to the counter girl/projectionist who tells him a bizarre tale of how the original Oz movie was playing at the time of the incident. She (Laura Heisler) is over eager to help them go down the Yellow Brick Road, a sign that marks the trial.

She takes them to the trail. There is a psychologist(Alex Draper) on the trip who is constantly filming individuals and asking them questions as a sanity check. This gives the movie the annoying feel of those reality type movies. Also in the team is his wife Melissa (Anessa Ramsey) and Daryl and Erin Luger (Clark Freeman and Cassidy Freeman). Cy (Sam Elmore) and Jill (Tara Giordano) round out the team as they head on down the trail laced with belladonna. The movie develops slowly as small things happen. Daryl finds a hat that is from the era, but seems new. Jill's GPS goes haywire, one minute they are in Guam, the next Italy. They joke about it.

They hike for five days in Northern NH (is that possible?)  Their instruments are not working properly and they know something is at work, but what? They speculate: Solar flares? Earth magnetism? Government experiment?  Emotions flare...

Good acting. Nice New England accent by Laura Heisler. I enjoy horror/mystery/thrillers and this one was exceptionally good, even though the ending didn't offer any closure.

4485183,3,B004W48KHK,"Picnic At Hanging Rock meets The Shining is how I'd describe Yellow Brick Road. I liked it. It wasn't your typical slasher-type horror film - the villain seemed to be the environment itself. The ideas in YBR were awesome but the execution of these ideas weren't always up to par.

Not to give much away but it was already mentioned in another review here about the guy ripping the girl's leg off (why would you want to rip off the leg of Tess Mercer from Smallville? Not very nice) - anyway, I really doubt a guy could rip off a girl's leg - even after bashing it with a rock a couple times - there'd be all those muscles and tendons and ..stuff. And the rock-bashing seemed so unenthusiastic - it was like he was using a real rock and would come down hard but then stop about a foot above her leg and gently tap it - you're going to have to bash a leg a lot harder than that if you want to soften it up enough to rip it off with your bare hands. Just saying..

But, all this talk of limbs being torn off doesn't do this movie justice - it is a genuinely different and eerie movie (loved the music) and the only real violence is in regards to that one scene (okay, maybe a couple of other fairly mild scenes). The ending isn't very satisfying either - not too many questions answered if any. But, if it's about the journey and not the destination and you like more of a mood-driven over action & violence type of horror film you'll probably enjoy this one.",1336435200,5,1456,4.196428571428571

The story is about a group of researchers on a trek in the NorthEast US to document the fate of an entire town that simply walked off into the woods one day, decades past, and simply disappeared.

4485186,4,B004W48KHK,"Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental and cannot comment on the audio or visual appearance of the disc.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

According to the backstory of YELLOW BRICK ROAD, in 1940 the residents of an entire New England town decided one day to abandon their village - they walked up a wooded trail and most were never seen again, although a great portion of them were found slaughtered along the trail.  Now, seventy years later, a small group of researchers are attempting to discover what happened and why the townsfolk left.  They won't like what they find.

The thumbnail image for this DVD is misleading - it reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes/dp/B004FLPFPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B00005JMDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>&nbsp;- and suggests a supernatural slasher type film.  There is no doubt there are some disturbing visuals here (or at least I found them to be) but that aspect of the film acts as an effective contribution to the atmosphere of creepy dread rather than as the primary focus.  Thus those looking for splatter and gore may be disappointed.

What this film does do, not quite coherently but still effectively, is create a very unsettling feeling, one just sideways enough so that I never had a handle on what was coming next.  It's a puzzling film - the character's motivations aren't always clear, and the resolution of the narrative leaves even more questions - but I have the feeling that none of that really matters.  Instead, with its mixture of gruesome images, suggestiveness, and unpredictability, I thought it a rare horror film that actually accomplished being horrifying rather than terrifying.

Still, its difficult to know to whom to recommend it.  If anything, it reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>, without the shaky hand-cam and a less linear narrative.  24 hours later, and I'm still a little creeped out by it.",1330646400,16,2268,6.0062111801242235

4485188,3,B004W48KHK,"Wherever a group of people foolishly enter the woods in search of a legend, I am there.  Well, not there physically, because I do not do bugs and critters - but I am there to watch it all through the voyeuristic prism of video.  YellowBrickRoad offers a particularly fascinating premise.  As the story goes, back in 1940 the entire population of Friar, New Hampshire left everything behind to travel up a nearby trail that has come to be known as the Yellow Brick Road.  Some of their bodies were discovered along the way - some frozen, some slaughtered - but a majority of the Friar townspeople were never heard from again.  The only known survivor could contribute nothing more than gibberish.  Now, almost seventy years later, an author/photographer has finally gotten his hands on the classified records and organizes a party of investigators to set out from the long-lost trailhead in an attempt to discover what really happened to those who made the walk all those years ago.  It sounds fascinating, and it is - for a while, at least.  The ultimate question, of course, is how a story like this should end.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers were never able to come up with a truly effective answer to this question - and it begins to show about midway through, as the structure of the film begins to break down.

The cast is centered on the husband and wife writing team of Teddy (Michael Laurino) and Melissa Barnes (Anessa Ramsey) and their academic colleague, psychologist Walter Myrick (Alex Draper).  For this expedition into the remote woods of New Hampshire, they bring along a tracker, a brother-sister team of map-makers, an intern, and a weird chick they meet at the Friar movie theatre who shows them the trail marker they're completely unable to find on their own.  Things start off OK (although I would have thought Walter would have had sense enough not to wear shorts for a trip through the brush), but things start to get weird a couple of days in.  Their GPS goes berserk, one dude starts obsessing over a hat he found, and the team begins to hear music.  I'm not talking bird song or wind whispering through the trees - I'm talking about big band and other vintage songs being played quite loudly day and night.  It's enough to drive you crazy - and that's basically what happens to the group members one by one.

Sure there's some suspense as bad things start happening to these people, but I can't say the isolated environment ever generates the level of creepiness I was expecting.  I never really developed an emotional attachment to any of the characters, either.  With better character development, maybe I would have had more of an emotional reaction to everyone's intellectual moorings coming undone as the rug of reality was slowly pulled out from underneath their feet.  There is one moment well into the film when I thought the story was about to reestablish itself with a really twisted tie to The Wizard of Oz, but that just didn't happen, requiring me to sit patiently as the movie basically unwound itself to the ending, leaving the ""why"" of the whole story behind in the process.

Despite my dissatisfaction with the ending, I would still recommend YellowBrickRoad to my fellow horror enthusiasts.  First-time filmmakers Jesse Holland and Andy Mitton show great promise, as they've produced a bond fide original psychological horror film of genuine suspense that doesn't rely on gore or special effects to work itself under your skin.  I really wish I could give this film more than three stars, but there are just too many missed opportunities here for me to ignore.",1327795200,4,3604,4.797734627831715
4485189,4,B004W48KHK,"OK, this movie will not be for everyone.  It bucks the mainstream horror trend in that it does not provide a plot-less, pointless gore fest (which I thoroughly enjoy at times).  It is slow paced, has an interesting storyline and even provokes a little thought.  The acting is good, the script is tight and the cinematography is top shelf. The few flaws that do pop up suggest inexperience rather than sloppy movie making.  No, I am not saying this is on par with Stalker or Solaris (for those who actually got the Tarkovsky reference), but the approach to film making is similar: The struggle to comprehend the dream vs reality,a sublime nightmare, the power of one's own imagination and consciousness all come to play in this movie if you let yourself go there.

So if you want something mindless, something to evoke the gross-out response, pass this one by.  If you looking for something that will take you in, entertain you while giving you something to chew on, leaving you pondering what it all meant for sometime after the movie, then hunker down, open you mind and enjoy the ride.",1326585600,,1087,4.6947368421052635

Storyline:
Nearly the entire population of a small town walks into the woods to die or kill each other in the '40s only to be later found by government representatives and hushed up for 60+ years. The movie's expedition is comprised of an odd assortment of people such as a psychologist to record psychological effects. He uses a cheap camera to record questions such as, repeat the prime numbers (as if anyone remembers the prime rules) and say the alphabet backwards. Just juvenile pop psych.  Another person has parks experience and another has GPS experience (that must take real skill). They retrace the route only to find the GPS and compasses don't work due to some pseudo-scientific effect called Southern Hemisphere centripetal opposite magnetic force or whatever. Then they start hearing really fakey 20s, 30s, 40s mostly wrong period music coming from the woods along with really fake squelch audio effects all of which causes the members to start killing one another in really fake enactments such as one where some guy pulls the leg off of a compatriot (physically impossible by the way) because she doesn't like his hat. Another when a woman jumps off of a cliff and all we see from a very long distance, so as not to be too clear, is a very cheap CGI that looks like a stiff plastic toy doll.

The group of travelers follow an ancient trail that leads them into the middle of the wilderness. The farther they get, they start to realize maybe the mythology they've been so deeply invested in is not as far from reality as they initially thought.

4485211,5,B004W48KHK,"I wondered about this movie when I saw the reviews, so was not sure what to expect.  Once I started watching I was riveted to the screen from start to finish.

There are no cheap scares and typical formula horror cliches here.  This is a truly bizarre and original film that is disturbing and unsettling, more because of what you can't see or don't know, rather than anything shoved right into your face.  A group of people go out into the wilderness to try to determine what made the residents of this small town leave their homes and (mostly) disappear back in 1940.  What they find is nothing in the area in which they are hiking is as it seems, and compasses and other instruments do not function properly.  Eventually they find that they are not sure where they are; they are haunted by 40's music that seems to come from nowhere and everywhere, and eventually, they start to go mad and turn on each other.  Those with enough of their faculties still remaining are torn between finding out the source of the mystery, now that they've come this far, or turning tail and getting the hell back where they came from.

For reference points, try a dash of David Lynch, a bit of Blair Witch without the shakey camera work, and (if you've read it) the sensibilities of ""House Of Leaves"".  But this is quite an original film, and definitely not one for those with no patience or those who just want to see blood and guts.  Yeah, there is a little of that, and it's almost so subtle you may need to back the film up to see if you saw what you thought you just did.  I guess the point of it is that it's just so unexpected that it's shocking.

Well worth seeing if you like different and unusual stuff, but definitely not for the hard-core slasher or gore fans.",1313798400,15,1755,4.382716049382716
4485212,1,B004W48KHK,this has got to be one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen.  the entire story line makes no sense and the ending also make no sense what so ever.  if it were possible i would give this 0 stars but since i cant i will give it 1.  do not waste your time or your money on this movie.,1313798400,6,283,3.6065573770491803
4485213,4,B004W48KHK,"I agree with many of the other reviewers in that if you just want a slasher film with an easy story than this is not the one for you.  If you want a movie that has an interesting backstory, a strong cast and a creepy, unsettling storyline, than you will enjoy this film.  I love movies with this kind of backstory whether a history of a haunted house or a haunted road and they showed that quite well with the documentary style beginning.  Bringing the characters together and letting us get to know them as they started out was well done.  Slow but I think that made the movie all the better.  And then the descent into madness/hell/??  This is a film that will remain with you after it is over.  Not so much to discuss but to feel.  I agree that I felt the ending was a bit of a cheat and still not quite sure what it was showing but I still enjoyed the movie and feel the need to watch it again to catch things I probably missed the first time.",1313625600,57,947,4.108695652173913
4485214,3,B004W48KHK,"Remember when you'd visit your grandparents and they'd play their favorite old tunes over and over and over and over again?  Did it make you so crazy that you told your sister/brother that you were going to kill them?  No?  Then this film isn't for you....

Did I enjoy the film's premise, yes!  It was well executed, the acting was solid and once you go beyond the ""ghost hunters"" concept and move into the why they are making this trip in the first place - it was good.  Was I freaked out by some of the more suspenseful moments?  Yes, absolutely.  I kept looking over my shoulder and turning on lights while I was watching this.  That part was fantastic and I felt the film delivered in giving me the heebie-geebies.  The scene at the cave really caught me off guard.

Was the ending a complete and total let down - HECK YEAH!  The premise held promise, the actors had me in full freakout mode and then?  Well, I won't tell everything, but let's say that even the Cowardly Lion would have said, What the what?  That's not scary at all....

So would I recommend it?  No, I am sorry to say that I cannot...If anyone is open to getting a slight thrill for 80% of a film - go for it.  For everyone else, see something else.",1313020800,8,1222,4.2894736842105265
4485215,1,B004W48KHK,"I don't know where to begin with this film. This is unbelievably boring. It made me want to go huff paint because the hallucinations would be better then the storyline. The directors, that's right 2, should be ashamed of themselves. It took 2 directors to mastermind a group of people walking around in the woods for an hour and half.

Looked like garbage. Story was garbage. After the first half hour I knew what we were in for. Avoid this like the plague, the bubonic plague.",1312934400,7,477,4.546511627906977
4485216,1,B004W48KHK,"Wow, totally screwed me out of my 1-1/2 hours of life. This movie blew. Not scary. Little if any action. All psychological and none of it makes sense. The cover is extremely misleading.

Avoid at all costs. To bad I had to give this even one star.",1312761600,8,247,4.25531914893617
4485217,5,B004W48KHK,"Every once in a great while I find a film that has a combination of atmosphere, cinematography and anticipation that is so good that it is mind blowing. There's nothing special about this story or the acting but, there are several scenes that are so disturbing (not because of content but because of how well done they are) that this movie is going to haunt me for weeks. I watch alot of disturbing and violent films and I could barely finish this one. I was just that freaked out.

Oh my god.",1312761600,8,528,4.29
4485218,5,B004W48KHK,"""Yellowbrickroad"" is not your typical horror film.  There isn't any nudity, nor is there any crazy partying/stupidity that occurs.  However, it makes you think.  Many reviews have mentioned that it's ""dumb"" or ""hard to follow"".  Moviegoers are so accustomed to being spoon-fed boring plot and terrible acting.  Then, a film like ""Yellowbrickroad"" comes along, and asks you to question it.  It asks you to ponder after you leave the theatre.  It goes beyond the thrasher movie.  If you see it and feel confused-take a day or two, think about the woods as the main character, then watch it again.  Focus on one character throughout and you will likely have a different opinion.

Overall-it's a fantastic film that is both refreshing and challenging to the viewer.  Bravo!",1312675200,8,769,5.023809523809524
4485219,5,B004W48KHK,"It may not be for everyone but this is a great, slow burn of an indie horror flick.  As it slowly peels back the layers of madness you will either end up frustrated and confused or you will appreciate the ride it's taking you on.  The scariest things in life aren't what we know, it's what we don't know.

I obviously fall into the camp that loved it.  Great script, great cast, great direction and great aesthetics for a low budget movie.",1312588800,15,439,4.317073170731708
4485220,2,B004W48KHK,"First, the technical part: streaming this movie on a roku was frustrating.  The audio wasn't properly converted into a digital format.  The background noise overtook the dialog and I found myself turning it up to try and hear the actors speaking and then turning it down when the music kicked in.  Very frustrating viewing experience.  If you're watching it on a roku, buyer beware.

As for the movie itself, perhaps I missed something due to the audio but it struck me as a movie trying very hard to be intellectual without actually having a point.  They eluded to a lot, hinted at something greater coming towards the end and I stuck with it hoping for an end that would justify the intensely slow pacing.  When the credits rolled, I felt cheated.  It kind of strikes me as a movie that wrapped it up quickly when the writer ran out of ideas.  There was nothing proposed to justify the madness.  It just kind of all fell flat.  Very disappointing.  But again, maybe I missed something because of the audio.  I really can't recommend this.  The cast, acting and filming was good.  The special effects were a little cheesy at parts but you kind of expect that with a low budget flick.  I'm giving it two stars in the hopes that maybe I missed the point because of the audio problems.",1312588800,3,1283,4.537117903930131
4485221,1,B004W48KHK,"I have watched a LOT of bad movies in my day... most recently with the flood of B grade movies on netflix & amazon, i've watched most bad movies than I ever thought possible.

And this is one of them. It is a seriously seriously seriously bad movie. It's shot well, but the acting is bad, the audio mix is reeeeeeally bad, and the story is just dumb and poorly executed.

Absolutely one of the worst movies i've seen in the past 5 years, and I like bad movies.",1312588800,5,460,4.157303370786517
4485222,2,B004W48KHK,"I really wanted to like this movie.  It's premise is intriguing, the cast is good.  It also manages to elicit some scary moments in broad daylight and the 40s music is just as annoying to the audience as it is to the cast.  But what in the heck is this movie trying to say?  I enjoy metaphysical components in film, but when they ARE the movie, I get lost.
THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME?  The clever insinuation of THE WIZARD OF OZ never gathers enough momentum to justify it.  Going into detail would activate THE SPOILER POLICE so my review is limited.  The film has a handsome look, using its low budget quite effectively and it's refreshing not to spend 90 minutes with clueless teenagers.  Brother and sister Clark and Cassidy Freeman are executive producers and also star as siblings.  The movie's deliberate pacing erupts in some brutal violence which makes these acts even more disturbing.
YELLOWBRICKROAD though well made just didn't give me a pay-off and when the credits rolled, I felt cheated.  My main goal in watching any movie is to be entertained.  If a writer's agenda is to please himself only, then my goal is not achieved.",1312416000,7,1139,4.645

There was a real purpose behind this movie- something along the line of, ""There's No Place Like Home"" but they bit off more than they could chew and it just wound up seeming undercooked.

They start to mentally break down as they start to hear & see things,putting 1 against another. The main evil,or main entity is unseen & unknown. I can only surmise that the ground is tainted and forbidden,cursed land. So the people who walk the road & seek answers really face their inner demons. Psychosis isn't too far off for anyone...just be stuck in the woods & let paranoia set in. All in all,it's good cuz the scenery,and the witch nailed to the tree. This is a trippy movie.

8444335,4,B004W48KHK,"Like a lot of good horror films, this one is a slow boil; it takes time to really get up to steam and start wrecking havoc. The characters are a bit interchangeable, but the main ones stand out, and the story doesn't suffer from having extras - none of them are so bland as to feel like cannon fodder, so it works out. The setting is excellent and the concept is quite entertaining; the menace that plagues the researches is never clearly explained and does not need to be - it makes itself felt in ways both subtle and gross, and creates a clearly mounting threat. The motivations seem slightly confusing, but again, this does little to detract from the story of a group of researchers slowly coming unraveled as they march toward the answers they so badly want.",1506902400,2,763,4.496402877697841
