Very grainy and not clear.
Disappointed!",1435363200,2,71,5.0
8624188,1,B00GKP70FC,I had seen this movie when it came out and looked forward to the dvd.  The dvd quality is terrible.  I think it was either just transcribed from an old vhs tape or maybe somebody recorded while it was projected on a wall someplace.  there is no closed captioning or subtitles and the studio is so bad I could not make it out.  I will wait for a better attempt.  Too bad.,1420070400,7,370,4.083333333333333
8624189,4,B00GKP70FC,"The movie arrived in good condition.  The movie itself and the story if you know the history, left out so much good detail.",1409097600,2,123,4.3478260869565215
