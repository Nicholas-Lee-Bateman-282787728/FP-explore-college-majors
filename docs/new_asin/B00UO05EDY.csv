8707691,5,B00UO05EDY,"An 80% CGI dark moody atmospheric film with shades of Diablo and Dante's Inferno.  I think the casting was perfect.  While the setting was stylized, everyone was believable.  It isn't always clear what is going on but it's a fun ride.  Definitely recommended for fans of dark realities and unlikely heroes.",1528588800,,306,4.9411764705882355

8707694,5,B00UO05EDY,The negative reviews are the reason horror sucks today. Every time someone goes off the beaten path and actually tries to make a good movie everyone hates it. This movie sucks but garbage like paranormal activity counts as good horror? BS. This movie actually tried to be scary and didn't end right when he got to hell. Was it perfect? No. But its a lot more original than most of the awful crap that counts as horror these days. My only criticism is the filters. I didn't mind the black and white but I didn't like the overly processed backgrounds. All in all though really something original in a genre that typically doesn't know the meaning of the word.,1496966400,6,657,4.529411764705882
8707695,1,B00UO05EDY,This was a horrible movie. I feel like a worse person for having watched it. I WANTED to like it. But I hated it.,1437523200,,113,3.75
8707696,3,B00UO05EDY,"Kitchsy.  Done in the style of Sin City and the like, but with less cohesion.  For a movie that was primarily crowdfunded, this isn't awful - but it could've just been an awesome short film instead of a mediocre feature length.  If you liked Pontypool (because this stars Stephen McHattie) than... you probably won't like this.  Unless you're super in love with anything Stephen McHattie does.",1435622400,,393,4.909090909090909
