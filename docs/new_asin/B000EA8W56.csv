8107873,4,B000EA8W56,"My young children really like all of the Story Keepers series, and I enjoy watching them too.  The animation is beyond it's time and great quality, biblically based, and the characters are Christ-like more so than other series we have seen such as The Greatest Stories and legends of the Bible.  The only thing that made me give 4 out of 5 stars is that some of the scenes in the films are double used in other titles, and some of the different titles actually greatly resemble each other.",1386028800,,489,4.48314606741573
8107874,5,B000EA8W56,"WONDERFUL FOR THE KIDS FROM 4 TO 12.  I'M A GRANDMOTHER AND I LOVE WATCHING THEM WITH THE KIDS.  I HAVE COLLECTED ALL OF THE 15 DIFFERENT EPISODES FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS ON MY CHRISTMAS LIST AND BIRTHDAY LISTS.  EACH EPISODE HAS A STORY OF JESUS PLUS THE ADVENTURES OF ROMAN SOLDIERS, ARRESTS, FIRES, ESCAPES, ETC.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1380844800,2,356,4.693548387096774
8107875,5,B000EA8W56,"My kids love this series and this one tells the birth of jesus in a very fresh  and lovely way.
However if you have the Christmas story keepers special be prepared for some duplication. The Christmas special
takes this story and a few others and puts them together to make a movie. That is not a bad thing if you have young kids and you want
to see the orphans get back together with their parents while skipping the story about Jesus death which is a bit
 intense for the three and under crowd. But my older son was disapointed that some of the plot was the same although Starlight has the
whole story about their trip and includes bits that were cut out in the Christmas special. If you have kids four and up and want to share
godly values with them I would call this story a good choice.",1346803200,,790,4.225165562913907
