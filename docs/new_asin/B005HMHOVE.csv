4702526,5,B005HMHOVE,"The show ""Victorious"" is one of my favorite shows ever so I love the DVDs. I think it's a great show for anyone in the age range 8-14. It's about a girl (Tori Vega) who attends a performing arts school with tons of crazy students. My episode ratings are:

The Diddly- Bops- The group gets paid to perform at a childrens birthday party in ridiculous costumes. Andre gets offered a record deal but when a video of him performing at the party goes viral, they think he doesen't take his music seriously. 4/5
Cat's New Boyfriend- Cat starts dating Tori's ex- boyfriend and Tori gets jealous. 4/5
Sleepover at Sikowitzs- The group has a sleepover at Sikowitz's house and they all have to be dressed up and stay in their characters. 5/5
The Great Ping- Pong Scam- When Tori hears that the school has a ping- pong team, she wants to join but the team captain, Jade, won't let her. 4/5
Wok Star- Jade writes a play but the school won't let her put it on because it's too ""weird and disturbing."" They find a restuarant where a lady will let them perform their play if one thing- her totally untalented daughter must be in it. 4.5/5
Survival of the Hottest- The group gets trapped in Beck's RV when it's really hot while Cat's out partying on the beach. 5/5
Wi-Fi in the Sky- Tori and Trina are on their plane late while Tori needs to be at home, writing a script for their school. 4.5/5
Freak the Freak Out- Jade and Cat meet some mean girls at karaoke and they have a contest. 5/5

In ""Victorious"", the story focuses on Victoria ""Tori"" who has been accepted at Hollywood Arts High School, after taking her sister Trina's (played by Daniella Monet) place in a showcase. While Trina is known more for her drive to become an actress, her sister ""Tori"" has talent that she is not too conscious about and now trying to fit in her new school.

She becomes friends with a talented musician Andre Harris (played by Leon Thomas III), a journalist/ventriloquist named Robbie Shapiro (played by Matt Bennett) and rival Jade West (played by Elizabeth Gillies) and her boyfriend Beck Oliver (played by Avan Jogia) and naive actress Cat Valentine (played by Ariana Grande).

With the DVD release of ""Victorious: Season One, Volume Two"", included are 10 episodes from the first season plus the ""iCarly/Victorious"" special.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Victorious"" is a fun and entertaining show that isn't deep, just teenage fun with music and comedy!

When I saw Victoria Justice appearing on ""iCarly"" last year, I had the feeling that Nickelodeon or even Dan Schneider was planning to use the actress for a new show and I was right. Victoria Justice who had starred on ""Zoey 101' and had short roles in various Schneider-related series has her chance to not just showcase her acting but also singing.

And here we are with ""Victorious""!

Because Dan Schneider's name is attached to this series, I know that the series has been compared to ""iCarly"" and when you make those comparisons, it makes it difficult because ""iCarly"" is such a popular show and if it doesn't measure up, some people tend to think its not a good show.

With ""iCarly"", the series tends to focus on three friends (and one family member) and there is a good amount of character development within those four characters. It's a tight-knit group featuring tight-knit stories and with ""Victorious"", you have seven individuals and storylines that primarily focuses on Tori.

In some way, because it's taking place at an art school, some people may feel that it's a contrived series that is a Nickelodeon take on entertainment ala ""Glee"" and some may even compare it to Disney's teenage film series such as ""High School Musical"" or the TV series ""Hannah Montana"" but in this case, it's not. It's a different type of series that takes on teen issues, friendships and wacky situations.

The show is primarily about Tori Vega and while others may display their musical or acting chops, its a series about Tori and friends. No one breaks out in song or dance unless the situation calls for it but if anyone is doing any singing, it's Tori Vega and sometimes her very crazy sister Trina.

I found the series to be fun and wacky at times. You have the teen drama, the teen angst and crazy moments, especially when it features ventriloquist Matt Bennett and his dummy Robbie or Tori's bratty older sister Trina.

Also, it was cool to see the special ""iParty with Victorious"" included with this DVD release and the collaboration with Miranda Cosgrove and Victoria Justice once again was very cool!

One thing I noticed about this second half of episodes is that the cast are more comfortable, especially with one another and they happen to be much more in sync.

As ""Victorious"" is on its second season, it's important to note that this is the second half of the first season DVD release, not the complete first season.

As for parents who are wondering if this is fine for children, for older children, I can say yes as there is no scenes that caused me to rethink of having my own son watching the series. But the series does focus on teenagers and it's a teen-driven comedy series. I didn't see any violence but kids who like to mimic what they say on TV, it's up to parent if they feel that the show is appropriate. I personally didn't find anything wrong with older children watching ""Victorious"" and may enjoy the music especially the comedy presented in the series.

Overall, ""Victorious"" is a fun and enjoyable series and with the second half of the season, the episodes continue its fun and crazy hijinks but moreso, the acting is much better as the talent are now settled in.

If you are a fan of ""Victorious"", this DVD is recommended!",1335571200,8,6729,4.825479930191972
