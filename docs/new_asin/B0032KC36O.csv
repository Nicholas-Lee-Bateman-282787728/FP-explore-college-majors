8387527,4,B0032KC36O,"This is a good doumentary; but is spoiled by being a non-anamorphic letterbox recording. This means it is displayed in a Windowboxed format with a black border surrounding all 4 sides of the picture on a 16:9 video screen.

Minus 1 star for not using a modern recording format on this DVD.",1322697600,,289,4.5576923076923075
8387528,5,B0032KC36O,"This is a shocking documentary about what is going on in the airline industry. If you learn anything from this video, learn that you get what you pay for and always make sure that your flight is being flown by the actual airline and not some subcontractor regional airliner.",1309132800,,274,4.612244897959184
