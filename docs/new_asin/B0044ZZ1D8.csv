This DVD is a great visual experience but the music is tribal and nowhere near the quality of contemporary Cambodian music or any European music of that era. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I understood the Khmer language but the male voices in their songs were very hard for me to listen to. Consider that in 1965 this production was recorded as live performances on soundtrack film and you understand more clearly its significance.

Apsara dancers are very complex in their characters, techniques and costumes. In Cambodia the Apsara culture also has a unique colorful approach to the design of fabrics which are best described as an infinite color twist to houndstooth patterns or more original repetitions of other shapes like diamonds, arcs or compass arrows. They make for exquisite designs. I would love to find more of them in clothing, accessories and other things like tapestry, window coverings and wallpaper.

I also bought the book, Beyond the Apsara. Interesting in its scope but more like a college textbook. It's price on Amazon ranges from very affordable to prohibitively expensive. The book has repetitive introductions by Princess Bupphadevi and its publishers. All of whom mention UNESCO but make no reference to it as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, so you wonder if they really know what they're saying.

It's like many books with redundant introductions but once past those you become more acquainted with the young and old academic culture of the traditional and treasured Apsara dance and more contemporary dance in Cambodia. You also become more aware of the challenging life of young people who struggle as most do worldwide, for the sake of their art.",1382572800,3,1764,5.096885813148789
