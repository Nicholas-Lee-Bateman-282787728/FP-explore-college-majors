8259701,5,B0015RRNKC,"This is an extraordinary film, a must see for anyone who wants to know what World War II in Europe was like. The film was shot by John Houston's Signal Corps unit. When the powers that be in the Army saw the film, they moved to prevent its release. It was just to vivid in showing what the war in Italy was like. And of course, it was completely different than the war movies Hollywood was churning out. So the story goes, Houston appealed to Gen. Geo. Marshall, who ordered it released. The film covers one battle in Italy. All elements are covered, from planning to fighting. There is none of the Huns-on-the-run-how-chased-the-Germans-away mentality of many war movies. It is a documentary in the finest sense. This shows the gritty details of war, including the only scenes I have ever seen of the stacking of dead GIs on to trucks, sewing them into shrouds and burying them, right on the battlefield. Houston had his cameramen right up at the front with the GIs as they advanced. Houston also shows the battle's effect on the village of San Pietro. All through the film, Houston's brilliance as a director comes out. While I have not seen the particular video offered here, if it is the standard version you won't want to miss it.",1470787200,,1235,4.592760180995475
