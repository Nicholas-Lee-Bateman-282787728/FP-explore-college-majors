8356777,1,B0028S10YC,I'm sure this is a great video but I can't play I t on either of my DVD players. I am not sure if it was exposed to to much heat prior to delivery or just a bad copy. Unfortunately it will have to go back.,1425772800,,205,3.4782608695652173

8356779,5,B0028S10YC,"I don't own this DVD (yet!) but i have seen most of it and i absolutely love it. True some of it does have a more moulin rouge/flapper vibe but anyone who knows anything about these dancers, particularly about indigo members, shouldn't be suprised in the least because that is usually the style they have. I also am a Louisianian and the whole ""New Orleans"" overtone described by another reviewer is dead on but while she saw it as a negative i think it adds a little something to their already amazing dances. There is a looser, more sexual aspect to this DVD than the previous one but again i don't think that is a bad thing.

While these dances may be more 'experimental' (which i don't find) than most are used to these women are exploring tribal fusion and doing it stunningly. So if your not a die hard fan of all forms of tribal fusion ,particularly the flapper vibe these women love so much, then this may not be the performance DVD your looking for. But if your looking to learn as much as possible from the performances of Tribal Fusion masters like Kami Liddle, Moria Chappell, Sharon Kihara, etc... then this is the DVD for you.",1292371200,4,1140,4.454545454545454
8356780,5,B0028S10YC,A must for all tribal fusion fans or any person interested in knowing the fundamental elements of tribal fusion.,1279324800,,112,4.947368421052632
8356781,2,B0028S10YC,I loved the first tribal fusions dvd but this one is too expirimental and not enough tribal..im not a big fan of the music and expected to see rachel brice or mardi love..loved sharon kiharas performances and zoe jakes are pretty good but this dvd is definitley moulan-rougey..its just different.,1255564800,5,296,4.94
8356782,2,B0028S10YC,"Where do I begin indeed?  I have to agree with the first reviewer, this dvd is all over the place.  As much as I love Bellydance Superstars, I just do not know what to think of this production.  Unlike the first Fusion dvd, which was awesome, this one does not live up to the hype.  The 1920's flapper, Moulin Rougey vibe seemed confusing. The performances seemed forced and looked like  not much effort was put into them.  The only performances that are worth the money I spent on this dvd are, Moria Chappell's second performance, Fat Chance Bellydance,  and Sonia and Colleen. Elizabeth Strong is just a mess.  Sharon Kihara, Samantha,  and Kami Liddle  were all ok but not the amazing dancers I remember.  I was very disappointed with this dvd.  I expected the best and got mediocre.  I don't recommend anyone buy this dvd unless you are a hardcore BDSS fan.",1251590400,14,862,4.592105263157895
8356783,2,B0028S10YC,I don't know where to begin. All the ladies looked lovely as usual but thats about it. The music selection is like a new orleans soundtrack literally sounds like a jambalaya rice commercial...like are you kidding me? elizabeth strong just doesnt seem to fit in right. A lot of this is too wannabe flapper 1930's sideshow freak dancing. It is wayy too over the top. The only alright performances were sharon's and fat chance bellydances performance.  I was absolutely dissapointed.,1251590400,11,480,5.0
