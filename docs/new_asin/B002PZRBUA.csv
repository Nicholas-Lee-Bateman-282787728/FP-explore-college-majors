THE PEAR TREE (Derakhte Golabi) exudes the beauty, mystique and aroma of an Orchard.

The seemingly unfettered innocence of late childhood.
The projected naive, personalised Utopia of ""Tomorrow"".

Precious, aching nostalgia and the sour reality of Lives forgotten or abandoned. Adolesecent eyes peering into unknowable futures greeted by, now, Adult eyes which speak to disillusionment yet glimmer with warm compassion.

Any flaws in script, acting, stylization etc are mostly insignificant.
Movies of Cinematic Poetry and Soulfulness such as this, BEG to be appreciated in their full aesthetic richness and majesty.

SO WHY ONLY 3/5 ?

Simple.

This DVD release by Irmovies. Com is, sorry to say, an an AUDIO-VISUAL Travesty.
Even some inferior quality pirated, bootlegged or Korean DVDs put this to shame.
Although I saw neither the Cinematic release, nor the original footage for comparison, I still can't imagine either being as poor as this!

Flat monoesque Sound ruins the touching musical score. It's something like a weak AM radio signal or a 40kbs MP3 - unacceptable in an era of digital sound & remastering.

Sadly the Picture quality is only slightly better than the Audio. Imagine a battered, 20 year old VHS tape ready for the garbage. I watched this DVD on a 30"" screen and it looked awful - dark, flat, bleary, overly soft and stretched (Yes, even at a mere 30 inchs!)

It also cost 15 (more than certain Classic Blu ray remasters).

However, if like Myself You desperately crave World Cinema in its numerous forms and want to see/own this (as much as I did) then please do buy this. I don't know of any other DVD versions/releases currently available (outside Iran that is?) and worse still it may even be deleted.

Still I think I'm justified to wish for a MUCH better release for this film and many others like it. For Goodness sakes let's establish ""Criterion"" & ""Masters of Cinema"" quality remasters as an Industry STANDARD. Amen.",1401753600,,2049,5.011799410029498
