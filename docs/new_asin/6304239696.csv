Since the only way one could read this review is if one searched  for it, I do not expect this to be seen by many. Oh well.
We pick up the  story three months after the fall of Uoodo. Chirico signs on as a mercenary  in the violent world of Kummen, and gets wrapped up in a brutal civil war.  He learns that the friends he was separated from in Uoodo are now living  here, and he also discovers the Secret Society's corrupt hands in this war.  After battling a blue AT with the reflexes of a Perfect Soldier, he sets  out to discover who it is, as he suspects it is his love Fyana. However, he  later finds out that there is more than one Perfect Soldier out  there...
This phase of the ""Armored Trooper Votoms"" saga tops  the first ""season"" in many ways. There are far more characters, a  major rival for Chirico is introduced, and much of the supporting cast from  before undergoes some major development.
As before, the animation is the  same--that is, it's old, and looks it. But if you're watching this set of  episodes, it's likely that you're used to it by now, so no points are taken  off for that minor flaw.
The plotting is excellent. The series keeps  throwing new stuff for Chirico to slash through, but keeps the twists at a  natural pace that allows for character development and emotion in between.  It never once feels rushed.
Also interesting is the new characters that  are introduced. They all manage to have distinct personalities with depth  and emotion without bogging the story down. Pol Potaria and Bully Kiderra  are two notable additions, as well as the quiet Shaku. Kan Yu makes for a  delicious annoyance, and Ypsilon...well, you'll know him when you see  him.
Meanwhile, the writers wisely develop Coconna and Vanilla's  relationship, and lets the amusing crush that Coconna had on Chirico cool  off, as it would have gotten tedious if it had been stretched out any  longer.
This is probably turning out to be the most ambitious anime  series I've ever seen. Can't wait to see what's next for Chirico, Fyana,  and the rest of the lovable crew in the later episodes.",955670400,4,2238,4.513715710723192
