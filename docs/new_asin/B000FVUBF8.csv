8127344,5,B000FVUBF8,"Big Guns is an independent movie in the best possible sense - warm, engaging, charming, funny and just a little bit irreverent As a softball player, I enjoyed the camaraderie among these players. The humor is classic weekend-jock repartee, made even funnier by the group of grandpas exchanging the one-liners. The mix of comic insult and affection, combined with their deadpan delivery, is note-for-note perfect. I laugh out loud every time I think about the memorial service for their fallen teammate. Good stuff.

Big Guns is a cross between The Bad News Bears and Grumpy Old Men. Even though this isn't a message movie, its gruff exterior is wrapped around a heartfelt point of view that team sports should be, above all, fun. These guys start out as best friends and, as they pursue the senior softball championship, lose their grip on reality. Ultimately, they have to learn all over again what counts most, and the players end up thumbing their nose at our win-at-all-costs culture. Good message. Also, the songs add a buoyant and faintly nostalgic tone to the games.

Are these songs offered anywhere on a soundtrack? I'd like to get a copy.",1160092800,,1148,4.8820512820512825
