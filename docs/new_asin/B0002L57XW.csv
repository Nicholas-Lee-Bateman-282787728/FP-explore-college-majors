2103254,5,B0002L57XW,"I watched it, and almost turned it off after the first 5 minutes but gave it time as some movies start out a bit slow.  What a beautifully shot movie, with gorgeous scenery, and a nice simple story.  I enjoyed it so much, and liked that the end wasn't as I had expected.  I came away after watching that movie, feeling good.  Its a simple feel good movie, and I think you learn something from Colin, the main character, as he has learned from all the folks he met through the movie.  Oh, and the comparison to Full Monty? No idea how...other than Steve Addy being in both movies, there are no similarities in any way.  Very odd...Oh, and the music? Awesome, I bought the best of CD for Kate Rusby last nite after watching and listening to her.  Shes a folk singer that performs most of the songs in the movie...",1101600000,9,811,4.296052631578948
2103255,5,B0002L57XW,"heartlands portrays Collin, a sad faithful husband who love his wife more than anything. Unfortunately his wife is a cheater and run away with one of his friend to blackpool for a dart game tournament.

The beauty of this film begins when Collin start his journey in order to win his wife back. Along his journey on his funny Honda motorcycle, Collin meet a lot of helpfull characters who make him see that there's a lot of things in the world better than his wife.

the ending is beautifully wrap up, which bring refreshment to your movie collection.",1098662400,,551,4.612244897959184
2103256,5,B0002L57XW,"What a refreshing film.  O'Donnell has no reservations about telling a story with artistry and care.  The acting is exceptional, though forced at parts. However, the cinematography truly steals the screen.  Of course, its probably not hard to find a good shot in the English countryside.  Probably the best part about this film, though, is the music.  Kate Rusby's voice seems to be able to tell the film's story without even trying. A work of art.",1098144000,,448,4.842105263157895
2103257,4,B0002L57XW,"A charming, non-sentimental, lovely road movie.  An indie feel to it which brought to mind my reaction to the wonderful STATION AGENT--at least in terms of the believable, warm, slightly oddball characters.  The lead actor, Michael Sheen, seems a UK version of Alfred E. Newman a bit but charming as can be.  The wonderful characters he meets as he mopeds to Blackpool to confront his straying and disillusioned wife are a joy. Most of all one is seized emotionally by the canny use of the music of the great Kate Rusby and John McCusker which fill the film.  Kate even appears in person in HEARTLANDS.  Buy the film, buy the HEARTLANDS soundtrack album, by everything Kate Rusby has ever done (including her recent concert cd, LIVE FROM LEEDS).  All are joys.",1097280000,4,760,4.763358778625954
2103258,5,B0002L57XW,"Assuming you like British comedy and British character films, this is a pretty good example.
The humour is gentle and not the black comedy of the 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' genre though.
Michael Sheen is a truly excellent actor and a pleasure to watch.
If you are looking for action or thrilling shocks or in-your-face laughs or eye candy, this movie is not for you.
Its good for a relaxing afternoon or evening after dinner when you don't want to be too excited or depressed but a bit of inspiration that does not preach is a good thing.",1356825600,2,548,4.49
2103259,5,B0002L57XW,"If you are a Michael Sheen fan, you must get this DVD.  The soundtrack is Celtic folk type music and is, by itself, great to listen to and fits the scenery perfectly.  The scenery, by the way, is set in the Peak District, and is breathtaking.  Sheen is perfect as the mild mannered Collin who wants to get his wife back. The wig was a bit much tho.  Highly recommend.",1331596800,,367,4.2
2103260,5,B0002L57XW,"England's Easy Rider. This is a little treasure I return to when I want a couple hours of peaceful enjoyment of beautiful English countryside set to haunting Gaelic melodies and combined with the magic of humans behaving as humans.  Michael Sheen does a terrific job as the boring and bored Everyman who abandons his mundane existence and journeys to self discovery: along the way we are treated to both life as it is and life as it could be. The score was my first intro to Kate Rusby and John McCusker's music; I'm now a fan of both.

I rarely write reviews, but feel compelled because I've purchased this charmer at least ten times and the world supply is dwindling. Get yours before they're completely gone. My copy keeps disappearing and I've given several as gifts. This movie and another favorite - Local Hero - just make me happy and take the bad taste of blood lust films out of my mouth.",1310428800,2,897,4.530864197530864
2103261,5,B0002L57XW,"I bought this movie because I'm a huge Kate Rusby fan.  The movie itself was quite interesting in its own right.  Anyone who is interested in cinematography should study this film because of some unique choices it makes.  The artistic choices work, but only to a select audience.

The movie tells the story of a man who has done EVERYTHING in his life for his wife, but whose life is, well, boring, and yet he doesn't realize what he's missing.  After she leaves him, he slowly begins to wake up.  The first ten minutes or so immerse the viewer in the main character's boring lifestyle.  So if it seems boring at first, it is, and that's the whole point of the first few scenes.  I don't think you can understand (or appreciate) the rest of the film if you don't suffer through the initial boredom with patience.  Yet the boring parts are masterful in their own way.  I've never seen an artistic portrayal of boredom that well done ever (not that I've seen many).

Then, eventually, the movie gets going, but at a relaxing pace.  The acting is generally good.  The story could be summed up into maybe three paragraphs (it's not a complicated one), but yet it works.  The camera-work is beautifully done, and the directing immerses you in Collin's inner journey.  One gets to know the friends he makes along the way, those who change his life, and those whose lives he changes.  In the end, as Collin awakens to life, something awakens inside the viewer as well.  Perhaps the greatest definition of artistic beauty I can think of as that which awakens in the viewer what is the subject of the art work.  This film, even at it's slower points, does that very very well.

This is an amazing movie, but not one that everyone is likely to have the patience to get through.",1278201600,2,1767,4.517350157728707
2103262,5,B0002L57XW,I have been collecting all of the works available on Michael Sheen since discovering him.  He is a very versatile and gifted actor and this movie did not dissapoint.,1237680000,,165,4.689655172413793

2103265,3,B0002L57XW,"this movie had plenty of opportunity for some witty/chuckle-worthy lines or slap-stick bits...but it just sort of deflated in the comedy department.  yes there were funny tidbits but they were fleeting and far too sparse.  not to mention i found myself questioning why he would ever go after the bloody skank. i mean, collin was pathetic, but still charming and you couldn't help but want to reach over and give him a hug.  despite its faults it does leave the viewer with a warm fuzzy feeling (that may make you feel uncomfortable if you only watched it cuz you've been reading all the full monty comparisons and were expecting a bit more *ahem* vulgar humor).  this movie is for types who can appreciate the art of the camera angles and visions of the lush country side.  the simpleness may seem a bit childish at first but it really leaves you with a happy-go-lucky grin and possibly a fetish with windmills. i was slightly disappointed, heartwarmed and enveloped by the romanticism of it at the same time.  truly charming.

i'm also a big fan of michael sheen.",1125792000,3,1064,4.688172043010753
2103266,5,B0002L57XW,"Set somewhere in northern England, this working-class road movie shares some of the same territory as ""Full Monty,"" but it's in a class all by itself. Though it concerns the song-of-experience theme of betrayal and infidelity, it's a PG-13 song of innocence about a woolly-haired young man whose hero is a national darts champion. His journey to a getting-of-wisdom takes him on a moped along narrow two-lane roads and across rolling countryside, where the people he encounters open a world to him he never knew existed.

Almost lost among the oafish, inconsiderate and embittered people, young and old, who surround him, he finds good reason to be touched by those capable of appreciating him. Instead of spoiling his innocence, his experience of this world only seems to deepen it. Michael Sheen as Colin is wonderful, his smile beatific, and his face registering a remarkable range of emotions. If it's possible to put a lump in your throat, this feel-good movie will do it.",1103414400,9,977,4.993865030674846
2103267,5,B0002L57XW,"Heartlands is wonderful.  It is beautifully shot and remarkably well acted.  The movie made me laugh out loud - twice - without having to resort to potty jokes or sloppy slap stick humor.  It also made me cry, not because it is an intrinsically sad film, but because it is in part the story of Everyman.  Unless a person is remarkably dull or a recluse, there will be moments in this film that could have been taken from the pages of anyone's life.  Granted the characters and situations are a bit larger, if not more colorful, than one might typically expect to encounter, it is Michael Sheen's (Colin) ability to humanize them that touches.

Without spoiling things for people who haven't seen the film, there is a scene in this movie that will stick with me forever.  It is so full of simple, unburdened joy that anyone who sees it will be instantly both amused and completely charmed.

8028901,5,B0002L57XW,"I really enjoyed this movie, but I can see that it may not be for everyone.  It's kinda a ""mood"" movie for me.  It shows the state of a person's life whose worked hard and honestly to help his loved one realize the life she wanted, but in the end she just used him.  She didn't use him intentionally, but that's just how the relationship developed, largely due to his naive devotion to her.  He then somewhat accidentally finds a new and better life for himself that he decides to pursue with the same naivety he lived with during his marriage.  I'd rather see 100 of these kind of thoughtful movies than a lame ""blockbuser"" filled with special effects and ""A"" list actor.",1480636800,,672,4.430894308943089

8028906,5,B0002L57XW,"This is such a beautiful film.  Slow, but steady, it is a real treat to sit and let the story wend its way through the main character's journey.  The film let's us accompany him from his hum drum life to share the joy in living he finds in his travels.
I have to warn watchers, though, that there is one fairly explicit, but short sex scene.  I'm no prude, but it was totally out of place, and should have been skipped all together.
Having said that, pick some time when you are in the mood to just sit and watch a good story, and let the film wash over you.",1393804800,2,558,4.054545454545455
8028907,5,B0002L57XW,"It's a shame that Heartlands has not gained more of an audience than it has, but with just 16 reviews on Amazon (including this one) over a period of a decade, this is the conclusion I must reach. Heartlands is the story of Colin, an outstanding darts player, who is dumped by his wife for another player on the local darts team, and is then kicked off the darts team by this player. Colin heads by motorcycle to the national darts championship in the seaside town of Blackpool (known as the Las Vegas of England) in order to retrieve his wife. Along the way he encounters people who really care about him and learns to truly live and appreciate life for the first time. As a result, he is a changed person by the time he reaches his destination. Between the haunting music, scenes of the beautiful rural English countryside and the backroads that crisscross that countryside, Colin's encounters with some truly beautiful people, and Colin's believable development and change, this is a movie well worth watching. The hour and a half it takes to watch it flies by, despite the fact that it is not a fast-paced movie.

One thing I would suggest. Unless you are extremely familiar with the accent of rural northern England, use the subtitles. Some of the dialogue is extremely hard to pick up otherwise.",1392422400,3,1301,4.656521739130435
8028908,5,B0002L57XW,"Can anyone spell T-E-R-R-I-F-I-C? I hope more than 14 people viewed this film because it is wonderful.  I like the story, the actors (especially Sheen), the beautiful countryside, the original music sung by Kate Rusby throughout.  The ending: totally believable, probable.  Okay, gotta tell ya this important thing:  There is one overhead shot of a campsite at night with all the tents lit up that ""is worth the price of admission.""  Unforgettable and utterly creative shot.  My advice: don't miss this film.",1357084800,3,508,5.134146341463414
