8407666,5,B003X3BYB0,"Yoga Pose Encyclopedia is an instructional video.
The instructor gives directions such as ... bring the shoulders down, place the hands in line/under....  and a proper amount of time is given to adjust oneself.
The demonstrator is in a bright blue outfit set against a dark background.
Only the demonstrator is visible.
This is not ""meditative"" nor ""peppy"" video (in my opinion).",1515024000,,379,5.112903225806452

8407669,5,B003X3BYB0,"I got this from a friend whom worked on the production and I have to say, not only do I love this but I don't know how I did yoga without it.  I find myself using it as a reference often AND it not only taught me new poses but reminded me of poses I have not been using and HOW to do them (some i was doing wrong).  It's a must-have in my library.",1282089600,7,347,3.6133333333333333

This Pose Encyclopedia is the latest DVD offering from Yoga Journal magazine; it is instructed by Yoga Journal contributing editor Jason Crandell.  The aim of this DVD is to offer a reference tool of 35 essential yoga poses, presenting each posture individually and offering 360 views, thus allowing the student or teacher to gain a greater understanding of the pose.  To facilitate this, Crandell cues the poses via voiceover while a single model, Cortney Cantrell, displays all of the postures.

After a brief disclaimer, the Main Menu appears.  On the left-hand side, the Menu offers the options of Welcome (a brief introduction, also done in voiceover, by Crandell), Credits, and a complete pose list in either Sanskrit or English.  On the right, the postures are broken down into the following submenus:

SUN SALUTATION ESSENTIALS
Three Poses

STANDING POSES
Eleven Poses

BACKBENDS
Three Poses

TWISTS
Three Poses

FORWARD BENDS
Three Poses

OTHER ESSENTIALS
Six Poses
(includes Corpse Pose, Shoulder Opening Series, & Victorious Breath)

In general, each individual posture breakdown is approximately 2 1/2 to 3 minutes in length.  For poses that are intended to be performed on both sides of the body, such as Extended Triangle, Crandell will state at the end ""Now practice your second side,"" but the second side is not shown.  The model's movements are well-timed to Crandell's instruction, and when Crandell mentions modifications, these are shown by the model as well--for example, using a block under the hand (other props include a blanket and a strap).  What the model does NOT show is the WRONG way to do the posture--i.e., occasionally Crandell will make a statement such as ""be sure that you are not doing ____,"" but in these cases, the model does not provide an example of the incorrect stance for comparison's sake.

Although the pose descriptions themselves are fairly well-done, I found the way in which the submenus were organized to be frustrating.  First, when you select a particular submenu--for example, ""Standing Poses""--there is no ""Play All"" option.  Given this, you are required to select each of the poses individually and return to the menu EVERY time, which is quite cumbersome.  Another problem I had was with how the postures are organized within the segments themselves.  Again using ""Standing Poses"" as an example, this section begins with Chair Pose, while Mountain Pose (which I think most yoga instructors would agree is the foundational standing posture) does not appear until fourth on the list.  Also, when he is instructing Warrior 1, Crandell refers to the previous work on Warrior 2--but this posture comes AFTER Warrior 1 on the menu.

Unfortunately, I believe that the difficulties in navigating the menus of this DVD significantly limit its usefulness.  Although it may have some value as a reference tool for beginning yoga students, the layout of this ""encyclopedia"" prevents it from being utilized effectively as a follow-along practice.  Finally, while I am generally a fan of video media, in this instance, I think more experienced students or teachers looking for a reference manual would be more likely to benefit from one in book form, such as Judith Lasater's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Essential-Yoga-Poses-For-Beginning-Students-and-Their-Teachers/dp/1930485042/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Essential Yoga Poses: For Beginning Students and Their Teachers</a>&nbsp;or even the more lighthearted&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cool-Yoga-Tricks/dp/0345465415/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cool Yoga Tricks</a>.",1280966400,20,3749,5.697841726618705
