The editing and overall feel of the film is great and holds your attention. Audio is clear, as is most of the footage, and they put forth some good effort in explaining what the culture behind it is all about. The interviews were also good as they spoke to people with different levels of involvement in the festivals. They definitely show how diverse the points of view are about this time of year in the country. My main complaint about it was that they could have strung the narrative together a little more coherently. At times it feels like it was jumping around and going on tangents for a little too long. Overall worth watching, if you have interest in traditional Chinese culture as preserved within the Chinese diaspora.",1387929600,,847,4.7687074829931975
8355623,5,B00284BVDG,"Having visited the Mitre hotel a few times, more for the atmosphere than the Tiger beer, I bought this movie for the short extra ""The Mitre Spell"".

Having paid for it I thought I might as well have a look at the main feature. Of course you can't live in Singapore for very long and not notice people burning paper during hungry ghost month. Even if you don't see it you will certainly smell the smoke. This movie explained the beliefs behind hungry ghost month, the rituals, the main events in the calendar and how these are evolving is a society which is becoming less superstitious.

The documentary contains interesting footage, both old and new. The new footage is very nicely filmed and the editing is well done.

I have no hesitation in recommending it.",1316131200,2,760,4.614814814814815
8355624,5,B00284BVDG,"This movie really affected me in many different ways. Learning about ""The Month Of Hungry Ghosts"" was like watching something surreal and interesting about the human connection to the spirit world. During watching the movie I would smell incense in my room yet I wasn't burning anything. So if you want to go deep then this is the movie for you...The documentary is well made and delivers a unique insight to that special month. I was honored to have one of my songs in the movie.....Akataka",1248134400,2,491,4.72093023255814
8355625,4,B00284BVDG,"The last few years there have been a number of fiction films that have built their ghostly plots around the Hungry Ghost Month, but this terrific documentary finally paints the facts in a far more fascinating manner.

Starting with the history of the Taoist and Buddhist traditions of ancestor worship and respect & complassin for the dead, this movie colorfully captures this month of ritual, superstition and personal greif and rememberance through the eyes of many of Singapore's inhabitants.  From Taoist Masters and Buddhist Lamas to Cab Drivers and Getai pop singers, their stories reveal personal perspectives, candid experiences, and deeply held beliefs.  Colorful animated sequences and live events illustrate the 18 levels of Taoist Hell, the origins of the Buddhist offerings to the Hungry Ghosts, and the many gods and spirits represented in the pagentry like the Horse Gods and the Demon King.

But this isn't some dry educational classroom - the film is as stunningly shot as cinematic cultural adventures like Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka.  Decked out in vibrant images and edited with a kinetic energy that  brings places and people to life.  Midnight rituals in lonely cemetaries are not meerly portrayed events, but the sounds and images capture the atmosphere of the moment in mystery and eerie beauty.  At times playful, and then turning to evoke a deep sense of awe and mystery, this is passionate and imaginative filmmaking at its most intimate.  From the varied rituals of businesses, resturants and community groups, down to the common street-level beliefs and practices - this is a rich portrait of cultural celebration and intimate persona rites that speaks not just about the spirits of the dead, but to their lingering impact and importance to all the living.

This illuminating, visually rich, and multifaceted look at these ancient traditions will be captivating to fans of Asian history and culture, students of religion, seekers of the paranormal, and really just anyone who loves a good spooky story.  Exciting and entertainig.  A big recommend - check it out!",1244419200,2,2089,5.2029850746268655
