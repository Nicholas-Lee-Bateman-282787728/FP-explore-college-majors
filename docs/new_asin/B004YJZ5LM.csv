4499710,1,B004YJZ5LM,"The trailer was better than the movie. It was boring, drawn out too long and just all around stupid. Not enough action.",1344556800,2,119,4.454545454545454
4499711,2,B004YJZ5LM,"Jean-Claude Van Damme appears in this movie, but as a support. His role is a pretty small one (his screen time is about ten minutes or less), although the film's DVD jacket might lead you to believe otherwise.

""Dragon Eyes"" is directed by John Hyams (""Universal Soldiers: The Next Generation""), son of Peter Hyams, who directed two Jean-Claude Van Damme films back in 1990s,  ""Timecop"" and ""Sudden Death."" In ""Dragon Eyes"" Cung Le plays Ryan Hong, a stranger with a past who has just arrived in St. Jude, a town ruled by a corrupt police officer Mr. V (Peter Weller). The first thing mysterious Hong does after renting a room is beating up the local drug dealers terrorizing the street.

As the film's story unfolds, we notice that ""Dragon Eyes"" is part inspired by Kurosawa's classic ""Yojimbo,"" or Sergio Leone's remake ""A Fistful of Dollars."" But the film obviously aspires to be more than that, as seen in the stylish 70s-style opening credit. The confusing script and its meandering plot don't make much sense with too many supporting characters, flashbacks and incidents that are incredible even by the standard of action films.

But what we need action. Jean-Claude Van Damme appears as Hong's mentor-like figure teaching martial arts in prison, but as I said before, his role is an extended cameo and his scenes are mostly shot with dim lighting. The film's fights are all in all decent, but often look bland. Cung Le shows what he can do as an accomplished martial artist, but the film still needs a better choreographer.

Perhaps the best thing about the film is the fine performance of Peter Weller, who steals every scene he is in. This is not a difficult thing to do for the veteran actor.",1344384000,2,1702,4.755932203389831
4499712,5,B004YJZ5LM,"I recently purchased this DVD because I am a big fan of Cung Le.  The acting was not bad considering Le's first major role.  It's good to see Van Damme back at it after his early blood sport years.  This movie is obviously for action and fighting scenes.

The fighting scenes look real and I enjoyed the character of ""Jonesy"" who plays one of the bad guys.  ""Jonesy"" should have played more because he looks more like a gangster than the other casted members.  Anyways, overall good movie for entertainment for fights!",1343174400,,518,4.576086956521739
4499713,4,B004YJZ5LM,"Dragon Eyes(released April/12)stars Cung Le as Hong(Pandorum),Jean Claude Van Damme as Tiano,and Peter Weller as Mr. V.The film was directed by John Hyams,and considering his extremely disappointing work in Universal Soldier:Regeneration,I was more than a little concerned about this effort. However I`m pleased to say that this film meets and exceeds my expectations. Hyams uses a light but stylized touch throughout the film,including an off coloured,sepia like toned lighting to emphasize the mood and look.
The plot involves Van Damme who is a lifer in jail for the accidental murder of his own son. He lived in an area called St Judes,which is run and controlled by Weller,a drug lord. He in turn has an Hispanic group running his east side and a black gang running the south side. To keep them both in check he,from time to time,will bring in the local Russian gang called the Devil Dogs. Weller also controls the cops,so he can have anyone locked down that he wants on a whim.
In the middle of St Judes is an apartment complex owned and run by a grandfather and his daughter. One day Le comes a calling,looking for a room to rent. Le has met Van Damme in prison,as he was sent up for the murder of a young lady he did not commit. In Le,Van Damme sees the Dragon Eyes,one good,one bad and both in conflict. Van Damme fine tunes Le`s innate abilities in martial arts and asks him,upon his release,to go back to his old neighbourhood of St Judes,and clean it up. Something Van Damme was originally trying to do when he was jailed.
Le does indeed go back and at first locks heads with the local gangs. Little by little he works his way into their good graces,and ultimately,Weller`s. Le`s plan is to play all sides against each other and it indeed works for the short term. In the long term however,Weller finally gets wise to his plans until the final showdown comes,in which the wrongs are finally righted.
It was an immense pleasure to see Peter Weller back on the screen and he plays his character to menacing perfection. Van Damme also does a good job with his limited role,virtually playing himself,as he teaches Le the finer points of martial arts. Le is also a credible performer here,and his strengths lay in the fight scenes. Watch for Van Dammes son as one of the two corrupt cops.
The story as I described it,is told in the film,in reverse order. So what we see as we are watching,is the past in flashbacks,eventually catching up to the present rolling along before us. The fight scenes were all nicely choreographed and through some judicious editing and camera tricks are given some really snazzy dynamic.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a 2:35:1 widescreen aspect ratio. The only extra is a 10 minute featurette on the making of the film.
One minor point I would like to make before this review irises out,is directed towards Sony Pictures. Sony has NOT been,I feel,promoting their Van Damme films to their full potential. I had no idea this film had even been released until I happened upon its mention on Mr Van Dammes Facebook page,then I went a-looking. Van Damme has been turning out some of the best films of his career in the last few years and Sony should be capitalizing on it big time. Maybe his fans should be writing to Sony and creating some of that VanDammage I hear so much about.....at least,in my opinion.
All in all a recommended film of drugs and corruption and ultimate redemption in the barrio. Get it today.",1342310400,,3471,4.673202614379085
4499714,4,B004YJZ5LM,"when i saw the trailer, i knew i wanted to watch this movie. not a big fan of jean-claude, but this one caught my interest. kept my interest most of the time except for the story line. Enjoyed the martial arts. would reccommend this to friends to see.",1341360000,,251,4.25
4499715,3,B004YJZ5LM,"Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a minor role as the prison mentor for Mr. Hong (Cung Le)...""There are two tigers inside you."" These are seen as occasional flashbacks. Mr. Hong rents an apartment in an Hispanic neighborhood of St. Jude and immediately draws attention to himself. He attempts to pit two gangs against each other (both work for Mr. V (Peter Weller) although does so rather poorly as he leaves a calling card with an oriental symbol for change. But wait...that is all part of the master plan. Mr. V also controls the local cops (Craig Walker, Kristopher Van Varenberg).

Rosanna (Crystal Mantecon) plays the straight honest daughter of the landlord.

Mr. V. recruits Mr. Hong to work for him. The film has some questionable plot points...such as why Mr. Hong was allowed to live so many times. It utilizes grindhouse style music and introduces characters with written screen titles, however the film doesn't quite flow lie a good grindhouse, either by design or poor editing.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (stunt double Arielle Zimmerman)",1338163200,2,1038,5.023255813953488
4499716,5,B004YJZ5LM,"I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen and it didn't disappoint. Cung Le's presence and acting ability was much better than anticipated. Van Damme's role was  a small but important one, and the movie was action packed and very well made. Cung Le made for a much better action star than I thought he would, and his action sequences were impressive. He is well spoken in his acting ability and the fight scenes are second to none. GREAT MOVIE. IMPRESSED. Give it a chance, you will not be disappointed.",1337990400,,510,4.483870967741935
4499717,3,B004YJZ5LM,"I was finally able to watch this and I have to say that I enjoyed it. I do agree with some other reviews that the story did have some plot holes, which was the main flaw of the movie. It felt like a lot of the scenes were missing about 5 min that would explain why the next scene plays out how it does. Still, this didn't really affect most of the overall enjoyment factor for me. I thought Cung Le was a cool lead. He has minimal dialog, which is probably a good thing, so he comes off as the strong silent type. As we all know, JC only has a small part...probably about 10 minutes spread throughout the whole movie. His scenes and his performance are both very cool though. I didn't really care for how his back story was explained but no big deal. Peter Weller was a blast to watch as Mr. V as well. The fights do have a lot of slow motion thrown into them but it actually works for the most part. It allows you to feel the brutality of street fighting...plus you see everything clearly, which is great. Hyams knows how to stay on a scene, which I love. As far as the side characters go, they are all cliched but the acting is actually pretty solid. The guy who plays Beach probably delivers one of the best crack head performances I've seen in a movie. The ending is very abrupt but I felt like it actually fit the tone of the movie. Like Regeneration, I really enjoyed the subtle music score from Michael Krassner too. Overall, the movie isn't great but I thought it was a well made little indie action flick. It totally felt like a late 80's/early 90's ""beat em up""  like Road House or Perfect Weapon.  3.25/5",1337904000,3,1615,4.223300970873787
4499718,4,B004YJZ5LM,"When ""Dragon Eyes"" was first announced in the midst of Jean-Claude Van Damme's budding comeback, fans pompously stated that it'd be his definitive reanimation vehicle and was headed for movie theaters. Well, they were wrong on both counts - this one's not about to see the inside of an American theater and it's definitely not a vehicle for Van Damme - but this isn't reason to be disappointed, because despite being a DTV production, it's very good action movie. Not mind-blowingly good (Van Damme's own&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-Regeneration/dp/B002U6CJCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier: Regeneration</a>&nbsp;was superior, if you ask me), but nevertheless one of the better examples out there of quality martial arts flicks being feasible on a relatively small budget.

The story: a soft-spoken martial artist (UFC star Cung Le,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pandorum/dp/B002QW7ALM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pandorum</a>) - fresh from prison and the tutelage of his wizened teacher (Van Damme) - seeks to redeem his past by cleaning up a neighborhood sick with drugs, gang violence, and police corruption.

As far as Van Damme goes, this movie does in fact mark a new stage in his career: it's the first time he's playing the role of a mentor, which is both satisfying at this point in his career and ironic, since the first time both he and Cung Le were mentioned together, he prophesized hostility between them (see one of his many online interviews in the last three years). Nevertheless, Van Damme's character plays almost entirely in the background and only has one (flashback) scene outside of prison. The movie is thoroughly a vehicle for Cung Le, whose last several years of playing supporting roles effectively bolster him to the status of a respectable action hero. The character he plays isn't particularly intriguing but he's got a fair presence and forcefully pushes most of his opposition aside as a film fighter. Peter Weller drastically steps away from his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B00005N7Z1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>&nbsp;legacy to heighten the cast value as a memorable villain, with one of the best interrogation scenes I've seen in a while to his credit.

The few reviews I've read about this film take aim at the story; I don't usually argue other peoples' opinions, but seriously - what were you expecting, guys? At any rate, I found no qualm with it: the plot itself is simplistic, but there are a handful of neat twists and character-based surprises to keep things interesting (e.g. Le's character earns control of a Latino gang and makes them surrender their firearms, because ""Only cowards use guns""). With that said, there's one resoundingly weird event that doesn't add up, involving Cung Le's character escaping from a thoroughly impossible situation. Steven Seagal pulled a similar head-scratcher in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mercenary-for-Justice/dp/B000E6ESD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mercenary for Justice</a>, but Le's unexplained disappearing act takes the cake. How the heck did he put that policeman in the casket? Also, I was sort of disappointed by the ending, but the fact that I had just witnessed some very fine fight scenes helped soften its abruptness. Cung Le isn't Scott Adkins, but he offers an exciting alternative of MMA- and karate-based action. In my experience, mixed martial arts have fared better in Hollywood than low-budget features, but ol' Cung could be the one to even things out with the big leagues. I appreciate the variety of fights, their almost complete lack of one-sidedness, and how well pro fighters like Scott Scheeley and Trevor Prangley made the transition to cinefighting by Le's example. Indeed, the fight between him and the latter name is in the running for ""brawl of the year"" as far as I'm concerned.

The production isn't perfect, but nevertheless, it's very strong. DTV-isms like computer-edited montages and slow motion scenes exist, but you can almost feel director John Hyams fighting to keep them to a minimum. As much as for Cung Le, this film is a victory for him as well in managing to follow up his abovementioned ""Universal Soldier"" movie with a worthy new entry. Plainly said, I'm eager to see what all of these guys get up to in the future, and action fans in general would be in the wrong by not giving this one a serious look.",1337731200,14,4574,5.62463768115942

Necessary for the movie, necessary for his career.  I never quite thought of it myself, but it was indeed genius.  Hong (the main character's screen name) did a good job of trying to keep up with Van Damme's, historically, unmatchable fighting presence and technique.  Hong looked strong, but lethal all at the same time.  His strict emotionless character was believable, and not over dramatized. The other actors, though not famous, played their roles well, and seemed comfortable portraying the characters that they were assigned to portray.  The plot was sort of re-used, and the dialogue and script was mostly simple sentences, but again the main villain, Mr. V was a great fit for his part, right down to the sound of his voice, and delivered his lines well, not having much to work with.  Everything was just right for an action flick.  Not too complicated, great action scenes, and the picture was good too.

4499781,4,B004YJZ5LM,"Bias Alert!!! I greatly appreciate action films and my secondary bias is I have over 300 martial arts movies. So I might be rating this movie a little high unless you love action films also. I am not a fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme and I don't know where this guy Cung Le came from so I have no love for the stars of this film. By now everyone should know that you do not see Van Damme films for the acting and rarely for the storyline. So now that I have given you all the negatives, let me tell you why I gave this 4 stars. First, this is the exception to the no storyline rule. This is a film about redemption and making amends for past mistakes. Second, the fight scenes are very well done, especially if you appreciate hand to hand combat.  There are no magic film fights here and no flying on strings.

Now that being said. Van Damme did okay with being a mentor and teacher to Cung Le and made for a better story since he was not the lead actor in this one. Cung Le is  a good martial artist but not as a fast as Jet Li or Donnie Yen. Those guys kick ass fast. But this movie also has other supporting actors to keep the story at least on an even level to maintain my interest.

4499793,3,B004YJZ5LM,"Director John Hyams has raised the bar when it comes to low-budget, direct-to-video movies.  His two recent sequels to the seemingly dead ""Universal Soldier"" franchise were astoninshingly enjoyable and refreshing, and in my opinion, both were better than the original.  When I read that he'd be giving MMA champion Cung Le (""True Legend"") his first starring role I was pretty excited.  I'd read a lot of mixed reviews about this film before I finally purchased it.  Reviews that mostly griped about the plot and its confusing presentation.  I would agree that some complaints in that department are not without validity but that's hardly what makes or breaks an action film for me.  I look for the action itself, which has been given both praise and criticism by other reviewers.  More on that in paragraph 3.

Cung Le plays the silent Hong, a former convict who moves into the gang-infested neighborhood of St. Jude (a New Orleans borough, according to the DVD box) with intentions of cleaning up the streets.  St. Jude is ran by two gangs: the hispanic 6th Street Kings and the all-black Eastsiders.  Both gangs and the police are run by Mr. V (Peter Weller, ""Naked Lunch"").  After kicking the crap out of a couple of thugs, Kong slowly earns the respect of the gangs and Mr. V, who eventually hires him to oversee both factions.  Kong allows the gangs to continue operating, albeit with some restrictions on how they treat the locals and who they sell their drugs to.  Life becomes good for both the citizens and the gangsters until Mr. V's large stash of cash comes up missing.  V then hires the Devil Dogs, a group of brutal Russians, whose prior agreement with V was the only thing previously keeping them from taking over St. Jude.

Those reviewers critical of the action have made minor mention of the overuse of slow motion and, perhaps, for many of them, it wasn't that big of a deal.  To me, it completely sinks the film.  I don't recall one fight that wasn't completely saturated with it.  Why does this keep happening with filmmakers who ought to know better?  Please stop it!  Stop and think about all the great martial arts scenes on film that have ever excited you and I'll bet that if any of them involved slow motion at all, it was used sparingly.  Unless your favorite fights involved the '90s output of Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson.  I'll even give American examples of good ones:  ""Undisputed 2 & 3"", ""The Girl From The Naked Eye"", ""Never Back Down 2"", ""Blood & Bone"".  Those are movies with great fight scenes!  All since 2006.  I'll admit that it's convenient to see a kick coming, knowing that I have time to get up, refill a beverage and come back before it's completed, but, ya know what?  I have a pause button on my DVD remote for just such an occasion.

Along with Hyams' most recent film, ""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" (also with WAY too much slow motion, thought it works a little better), Jean Claude Van Damme's name is listed at the top of the DVD, clearly indicating a starring role, despite maybe 10 minutes of actual screen time.  Now for me that's not much of a deterrent as I'm not a particular fan of Van Damme.  Oh, there's a handful of his flicks that I enjoy, but deliberate deceipt concerning his involvement is still a risky move considering how many fans the Muscles from Brussels has out there.

The DVD from Warner Bros has good picture quality with English as the only spoken language and subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.  This DVD has NO special features, either.  Again, the slow motion may not bother others nearly as much as it bothered me but I cannot recommend it primarily for that reason.  Otherwise the acting's decent and there are quite a few unique touches for a low-budget kick-flick.  Cung Le does a good job and I look forward to seeing him in more flicks.  The leader of the Devil Dogs is played by MMA fighter Trevor Prangley and his film presence needs to be taken advantage of ASAP.  Hyams is still in my cool book but he's on probabtion.  2.5/5

4499794,3,B004YJZ5LM,I was interested in this movie because i am a Van Damme fan. I have seen Cung Le in a few fights on TV and his style caught my interest. What also caught my interest was the plot of this movie; which was good. The action was acceptable. The ending took away from anything the previous scenes did to highlight the movie. They should remake the ending. Seriously.,1362873600,,361,4.323529411764706

4499796,4,B004YJZ5LM,"Cung le does a very good job as a ex con seeking redemption in this unique, suspenseful, and interesting actioner.  JCVD is at his very best as a melancholy convict (carrying a heavy burden) who teaches Cung Le how to learn how to fight, and redeem a neighborhood known as St. Jude Square, which is essentially run by a corrupt police force using two warring gangs to carry out their schemes and machinations (great turn by Peter Weller as the corrupt police chief).  The story has many interesting, and not altogether predictable plot twists, and unique insights, as well as little unresolved mysteries (I am sure deliberate), contained within what appears on the surface to be a simple plot.  The acting is solid, and the film well worth a look.  Hyams has really started making some interesting films as of late that leave you with a bit to think about.  The film also carries with it some truly laugh out loud funny scenes, that are in some ways a demonstration and indictment of the human condition, and a statement on the fragility of men.  Very good stuff. Big recommend on Dragon Eyes.",1361491200,,1093,4.666666666666667

4499800,3,B004YJZ5LM,"At the end of the day this is just another direct-to-DVD action movie--but it's a good one.  But Cung Le has some hard-hitting cool fights and, fan or not, Van Damme has a pretty cool role.  However, admittedly, not nearly as much Van Damme as I expected based on the trailer...which was a bummer.

Hong (Cung Le; The Man with the Iron Fists, Pandorum) is a soft-spoken fighter who can handle himself pretty damned well.  He takes on four Latin hoodlums by himself just for the Hell of it.  He's not superhuman and the choreography is nothing flashy.  It is, however, brutally ""practical"" and, because of that, impressive in its own way.  Although, it's not without a little cinematic flash, fights rarely seem unrealistically one-sided; a rare and good thing.

We alternate between two different times: a past when Hong is in jail being mentored by Tiano, and the present when Hong is living his life as a free man.  In prison, Tiano (Jean-Claude Van Damme; The Expendables 2, Assassination Games) transforms Hong from a fighter who studies martial arts to a martial artist who studies opponents.  Disappointingly, all the scenes with Van Damme from the trailer seem to represent the entirety of his screen time in the movie.  Big Bummer.

Mr. V (Peter Weller) runs the crime in the town of St. Jude.  He's a farcically over-dressed crime lord who takes a piece of all the action of the local black and latin gangs.  He's smooth, calm and collected most of the time.  But mess with his money and, well...there's a cool scene where he teaches a hooker how to beat up on a sadist.  At the end of the scene, she shows us she appreciated the lesson and that she learned.

Hong is a mix of vigilante and criminal but we don't know why.  He obstructs the business of the black and latin gangs which, in turn, affect Mr. V.  He even cleans out a drug den and he never keeps any of the spoils for himself.  Then, by Mr. V's demand, he starts to work with the local gangs and changes the way they run things...no guns, no selling drugs to kids, upping the prices.  This brings in less revenue, but makes the locals of St. Jude feel safe (and that Mr. V is the one who cleaned it up).

Hong is eventually double-crossed.  But, like in any Van Damme movie (or Dragonball), the hero must be defeated before retraining and returning victorious.  Hong's training montage is no Van Damme homage, but he still throws a mean kick and even suplexes a guy in the end.  Typically, these martial arts action movies have endings more like videogames than reality, with men favoring fists over firearms and one-on-one at a time over gang tactic combat.  This movie is no different, the finale's outcome doesn't make much sense given the intended goal of the story, and I didn't feel satisfied by it.

The victory in this movie is finding Van Damme in a different kind of role (that of the teacher, not the student) and finding Cung Le in a leading role (instead of his often effective supporting roles).  I was entertained and look forward to seeing more of both of them.

Director John Hyam (Universal Soldier: Regeneration, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning) has developed a fine knack for making the most out of humbly budgeted action flicks.  I'm guessing it's just to please JCVD, but among his common actors is Kristopher Van Varenberg (Van Damme's son; Universal Soldier: Regeneration, Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, Assassination Games) in a tiny role.  I'll let it pass.  If that's what it takes to get this level of Van Damme-ity, it's worth it.",1352246400,,3541,4.6521739130434785
