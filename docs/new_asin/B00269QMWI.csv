Many companies have come and gone, trying to compete with men's magazines, such as Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, and other such magazines. Oddly enough, Frazier Photography & Video has survived since the early 1990's. They used to do their videos on VHS, and some of their older stuff can now be purchased on DVD.

This video is no exception. Oddly, this is a more recent DVD, as the copyright is 2009 (MMIX), although the DVD box says 2011 (MMXI). The video is exactly as the title implies, 15 girls being photographed and video recorded in a ""Playboy-esque"" style backstage photo-shoot. The DVD has a running time of a little over an hour, so each girl gets about 4-5 minutes of ""Face"" time. The sound/background music is pretty good and goes well with the video as well as each girl. The video quality is not bad, obviously they used a very cheap camcorder to do the video, as the color quality is not exactly the best.

Overall, the DVD is not bad and it is worth the watch. If you can get it for about $10-$15, that would be the best price to get, anything higher and you are really paying too much for it. FOR ADULTS ONLY!!!",1403136000,,1219,4.486486486486487
