I liked the fact that its NOT the usual travel video with a host in every scene doing things that an average visitor would Not actually be doing on vacation. Most travel guide shows are like this, but this Travel With Kids DVD shows a regular family doing fun stuff, and has scenes with the kids actually doing the activities, so it was fun for our kids to watch, and get excited about the vacation. It also shows thie kids getting tired, and some of the long drives, etc, so it shows the good and bad of a trip with kids. I would recommend this DVD to anyone planning a trip to the Big Island for all ages, or even if you have been and want to revisit the scenery, history and culture of the islands. It has good bonus features too. Worth the price!",1203206400,6,904,4.23121387283237

Actually, the best part of the video was the special features on recipies and how to make an erupting volcano for the kids.",1177977600,2,288,4.627450980392157
