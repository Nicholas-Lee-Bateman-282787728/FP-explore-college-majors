4985733,5,B006G2FK10,This movie is simple and haunting.  It tells a compelling story of the death of a village from the eyes of a young photographer who comes upon it by accident and stays for awhile with them.,1389052800,,189,4.25
4985734,5,B006G2FK10,"This film may move a little slow to those more accustomed to mainstream cinema (eg, stuff exploding, eye-candy images and catchy soundtracks.) But give it a chance. This was a moving, meaningful and awesome film. I would watch it again, and I also am interested in seeking out other films associated with the director.",1375056000,,318,4.907407407407407
4985735,5,B006G2FK10,"This movie isn't a fast moving Hollywood (brain-dead) movie. It moves in silence but has powerful messages. You have an older woman-living in the past-writing letters to her dead husband. She lives alone making bread to a town that has a hand-full of older people. Their lives revolve around going to Mass, eating together in practically silence and making her bread. Then a younger woman comes and stays with her, a photographer. You learn the older woman's son died when he fell when his babysitter tried to take a picture of him.
The town reminds me of the last step before these old souls close their eyes for the last time. A cemetery is closed to the public but is a daily reminder that this is the last stop for them. I found it beautiful and the ending with the pictures and opening of the gate was unbelievable. It's a movie that seems ""simple"" but you walk away wondering...and isn't that what a movie is suppose to do?",1372723200,,929,4.535714285714286
4985736,5,B006G2FK10,"This the latest release in the on-going library of Film Movement, which puts out foreign and indie movie that otherwise would never get a chance for a US release. I recently subscribed to the monthly DVD release and got this a few days ago (and the movie is shown in a few art houses as well).

""Found Memories"" (2011 release from Brazil; 97 min.) brings the story of ""a city that time forgot"", in this case a far away city in Brazil (some hours away from Rio), where we see one elderly woman (Madalena) go about her business: get up in the middle of the night, make bread, take it to the coffee shop where she has the same argument everyday with the coffee shop owner, go to church, have lunch, take care of the (closed) local semitary. Then one day, out of the blue a young woman named Rita (I'm guessing mid-20s) arrives and wants to stay a few days. Rita asks Madalena if she can stay at her house and Madalena reluctantly agrees. Eventually these two women form a bond.

That's pretty much it for the ""story"" line, but the non-story story line cannot capture the sense of the movie unless you've seen it. The camera is pretty much static, letting scenes develop, and what a grace that is, like watching a paiting come to life. At one point, Rita, sitting outside in the evening, exclaims ""I've never heard so much silence"", and how true that is. In the first half hour of the movie, I was wondering where this was going, but then afterwards I was getting transfixed more and more by the entire experience. What a movie! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

The bonus short film on the DVD is also very much worth seeing. ""Land of the Heroes"" (2011 production from Belgium; 19 min.) is set in Saddam Hussein-era Iraq, and we watch young kids deal with bullying. Check it out as well!",1340236800,8,1770,4.44
4985737,5,B006G2FK10,"I saw this film over a week ago in the theater and am still thinking about it.  I don't think I've ever watched a film that said so much by saying so little.  The pace is languid, the cinematography beautiful (as my friend who saw the film with me said-it's like watching a Vermeer painting come to life)and the acting excellent.  I don't even know if these people ARE actors, they seem so realistic as villagers living out their daily life in a forgotten Brazilian town.  You witness people who have no hopes and dreams and expectations left, they are just living their life until their time runs out with no hope for anything different to happen or change-perhaps fully being able to experience life as it is, without any artifice.  If ever a film will want you to take up bread making, this is it.  The director did an amazing job of showing the beauty and contentment and comfort to be found in daily life, if you slow down enough to see it.  Highly recommended.",1339372800,10,966,4.454545454545454
4985738,5,B006G2FK10,"Found Memories is my new obsession! I don't usually seek out highbrow art house movies but this film is simply fascinating. The deliberate pace coupled with striking visuals and brilliant cinematography adds to the beauty of the film.
Subtle and powerful, Found Memories brings you on a journey of discovery where all your preconceptions are challenged. Found Memories is not only a smart, poignant and moving film, it's an experience.",1338940800,10,435,5.228571428571429
8497379,5,B006G2FK10,"If you are a person that goes to an art gallery or museum and looks at a painting for a good amount of time,  examining the subtle nuances of texture, color, composition etc. trying to understand what the artist is conveying than you will love this film. In each and every scene the camera is locked down. No pans, tilts or zooms. The only effects are a couple of fades to black. The action is within a stationary frame just like a painting. It is also a visual poem. Each scene a stanza telling a simple, but intriguing story with a satisfying conclusion. If you love art, you are in for an extraordinary treat.",1516665600,,612,4.368421052631579

8497381,5,B006G2FK10,"Few movies transcend our conscious understanding of life nd its eternity. ""Found Memories"" makes us endure.
I personally loved Lisa's beautiful performance.",1481068800,,156,6.136363636363637

8497384,3,B006G2FK10,"I may be in the minority among the reviewers for this movie but I found it excruciatingly slow.  Yes, there is meaning and silence throughout, but it didn't draw me in like other Film Movement movies.  Sad, as I've usually found movies from Brazil and Argentina to be extremely intriguing to watch.  As for the plot, other reviewers have adequately covered it.",1415836800,,360,4.774193548387097

8497386,5,B006G2FK10,A most visually evocative and tender story with a surprise ending and not to be missed.,1407715200,,87,4.5
8497387,5,B006G2FK10,"This is one of those rare pieces of art that touch you deeply and obligate you to slip into reveries, perhaps in your own dear company, and at your own sweet pace. I personally found it profoundly humanizing and very relatable. The cinematography and lighting were brilliant. Quite simply, one of the best cinematic works I have seen.",1401321600,2,334,4.775862068965517
8497388,5,B006G2FK10,"No, not much is happening in this movie but is a beautifull fairy tale about jong and old and dealing with death.
Must see",1392681600,,122,4.125
