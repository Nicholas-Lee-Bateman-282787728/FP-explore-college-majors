8252968,5,B0013U6TAQ,"This is an excellent series, Although many would disagree with the literal fundamentalism of some of the presentations (Father Barron noted that Bible is not to be read literally in every instance; sensitivity to genre is essential), nonetheless the theocentric perspective of the collection should be endorsed, especially in cultures that believe ""scientism"" (See Father Barron on YOUTUBE) is the ONLY way to understand the universe and its logos.",1415577600,,448,5.507246376811594

8252970,4,B0013U6TAQ,"The first video is really slow, and doesn't deliver the 6,000 years of earth history in one hour as stated in the promo, but gives a quick overview of 6,000 years of earth history in just a few minutes. Videos 2-4 are very, very good! I haven't watched 5-10 yet, but am looking forward to it. Lectures were videoed, and would have been better had we been able to see on the videos what the live audience could see on the big screen in the auditorium. Overall, well worth the money!",1367020800,7,481,4.2967032967032965
8252971,5,B0013U6TAQ,History taken from the original sources.  Not some pseudo-academic's opinion of another pseudo-academic's thoughts which is what you get from college textbooks from the last 50 years.,1354233600,9,183,5.777777777777778
8252972,5,B0013U6TAQ,"I am a Christian, and have been looking for a history teaching aid that doesn't leave out all the aspects usually left out in secular books. I have read books like ""Under God,"" by Toby Mac, et cetera. It's interesting how many of the things that truly went on, yet, never make it into the standard text books. But, that doesn't mean it isn't true or reality. Your not going to hear ALL the information regarding history from public school text books, first, because it would be impossible. Second, because they are written with their own agenda to push that excludes Christianity or twists it. I am excited about this and will tell more after I view it all with my students.",1337731200,7,674,4.532786885245901
8252973,1,B0013U6TAQ,"Buyer be advised: this series is ""designed to dispel anti-Christian myths of historiography"" where ""a fundamental principle emphasized by each speaker is the providence of God and His sovereign direction over every fact of history.""

  In other words, this is history from the Christian point of view.  If that's what you are looking for, enjoy; if not, beware.  By no means is this an attack on any historical perspective.  It's merely a clarification of this series' content.",1311897600,20,477,5.12987012987013
8252974,1,B0013U6TAQ,"This isn't a history series at all, but rather the rantings and ravings of the fringe neo-con neofundamentalist reactionary Evangelical lunatic fringe, served up in pseudo-academic disguise.  It has no value in terms of learning history, however it might be useful if you have a pedagogical need to demonstrate how objectivity and historic fact can be subjugated to political expediency.  I use excerpts from this following lessons on Nazi Germany and political propaganda, racial scapegoating, and then follow up on this with a critical analysis of pseudo-news and the neo-con movement in the 21st century.  Otherwise, don't waste your money or time.",1285459200,18,651,5.362745098039215
8252975,5,B0013U6TAQ,"This is a wonderful, eye-opening view on some the things that have gone one in history. Incredibly important, Doug Phillips parallels some of the ancient cultures to today and shows us where we may be headed if we don't change. This set is worth every penny!",1259107200,25,258,4.630434782608695
