8051101,3,B0007R5LZK,"""World Champions on Ice: Forever Gold,"" skates from the 1995 Worlds, contains these skates, some as mere clips, a few apparently complete:

Pairs

Jenni Meno and Todd Sand - Turandot (long)
Radka Kovarikova and Rene Novotny (long)

Mens Singles

Todd Eldredge (long - complete)
Elvis Stojko - Christopher Columbus (long - complete)

Ice Dancing

Oksana Gritschuk and Evgeni Platov (long - complete)

Ladies Singles

Michelle Kwan (clip)
Nicole Bobek (clip)
Chen Lu (long - complete)
Surya Bonaly (long - complete)

In Ladies Singles, Chen Lu's gold was the first medal won for China in an international competition.  Bonaly -- whose skating was not polished or attractive -- was awarded silver.  Bobek got bronze.

Video excellent.  Surround sound on surround systems.

Major disappointment: very few complete skates, only a few seconds of Kwan's short (the cover illustration is from her long program -- none of which is included), though she was apparently the only one of the top four who skated two clean skates.  Even at that she came in fourth because of her alleged ""lack of maturity"".  If a person is old enough to be eligible to compete, shouldn't s/he also be eligible for a medal based upon abilities and skills as shown in performance, rather than be judged solely according to age?

Would need at least an additional 30 minutes to make it worthwhile.",1291852800,,1363,4.986666666666666
