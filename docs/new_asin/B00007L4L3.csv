7977959,5,B00007L4L3,"This is where it starts to get REALLY good. It gets very addictive from here on in. When i first saw these episodes on Cartoon Network, I could barely wait until the next day for the next episode. I don't know how a show could be so good. I must really thank Cartoon Network for introducing me to these great shows through Toonami.",1049155200,2,331,4.26984126984127
