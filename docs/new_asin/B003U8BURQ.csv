8405709,5,B003U8BURQ,"I saw My Necklace - Myself when it first came out in the local Fallbrook California theater--the same town where the movie was made.

It has won award after award on the independent film festival level; and again, I have no doubt this film will make a notable mark in film history. I would think this first public run of the film will be a collector's item in years to come.",1278460800,,472,4.314606741573034
