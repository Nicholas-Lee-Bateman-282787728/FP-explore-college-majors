2664158,5,B000IVDBF2,"Growing up in a household full of firearms. My father was a Sheriff and a gun shop owner. I fired my first .22 when i was 4 years old, around this time I was introduced to Eddie. This informative video stuck with me for the last 23 years and if/when I am to have my own children I will introduce them as well. The idea is basic but sticks with you. I would highly recommend this for any family with firearms and children. I wish i could give this more stars!",1378339200,3,458,4.043956043956044
2664159,5,B000IVDBF2,"Very catchy tune, the kids remember it easily. It shows the kids how to handle different situations if they ever found a gun. I just wish it was alot longer! Only 7 minutes! But they did learn the tune and dance right away so I'm glad I got it.",1368489600,2,244,4.0

2664161,3,B000IVDBF2,"We had heard great things about the EDDIE EAGLE products, we bought our son a BB gun and wanted ot teach him about using it safely, guess it was our bad for not researching better, but the 15minute snippet may keep him safe in other situations I suppose. Just not what we we expected.",1353369600,3,284,4.277777777777778
2664162,5,B000IVDBF2,"We are police officers and though there are no guns available to my child, we thought we could use some help in educating him early.  So, at age 4, we got him this video.  He loves it and asks for it by name.  The tune is catchy and the film is short (5 minutes?)but it makes great points for young and older children alike, without scaring them.",1245024000,5,346,4.134328358208955

8147621,4,B000IVDBF2,"Stop.
Don't Touch.
Leave the area.
Tell an adult.

OK, that's great and memorable and just about exactly the right message to first teach children about gun safety when a gun is accidentally encountered.  This video is 10 minutes long.

I need another video about gun safety when guns are part of the household, and safe behavior at the range.",1403481600,3,343,4.683333333333334
8147622,5,B000IVDBF2,I had the VHS for my older grandchildren and needed to update to a DVD for the younger children.  Excellent and urgent teaching for all children.  The DVD arrived on time and as advertised in perfect condition.  Thanks!,1395532800,2,219,4.7105263157894735
8147623,1,B000IVDBF2,I ordered Eddie eagle on DVD. I received Eddie eagle on VHS. I don't even own a VHS player anymore. If you order this you'll need to buy one. Not at all as described. Very disappointed. Amazon should pay more attention to people/businesses that sell on their site!,1392940800,,264,4.520833333333333
