8147737,3,B000IY06SO,My son was very excited about this movie but it was very short and not worth the $.  I would recommend Bob the Builder and not this!,1261785600,,132,3.888888888888889
8147738,5,B000IY06SO,"My three year old saw this on youtube and we purchased it. The songs are catchy and the computer animated graphics are interesting. It held his attention and he watched it a lot! The plot is a little odd to adults, but my son never mentioned it. There is a disagreement and then a make-up. I would not suggest this DVD for the moral plotline, but just for the interesting machines. Great DVD!",1254787200,,392,4.383561643835616
8147739,2,B000IY06SO,We were very excited to buy this after seeing the intro for this DVD.  My two year old son absolutely loves trucks and we watched the preview on Youtube and sang the intro song over and over.  It turns out that the intro was the best part because we were all bored by the rest.  Now he refuses to watch even the intro.  Hopefully if they make another they'll make the story move a little faster.,1173312000,,395,4.157894736842105

8147741,5,B000IY06SO,"We showed this video at my daughter's 2nd birthday party, to kids ranging in age from 1-3, and to their parents.  The video captured everyone's attention, and all I heard was positive comments about how well it had been put together.  There is something in this video for almost everyone.  While the script and setting are geared at younger kids, the personalities that the different vehicles have, have adult subleties.  Everyone knows a Barry or two!",1019520000,,452,4.907894736842105
8147742,5,B000IY06SO,"Noah is 2 and won't put his new Cody's Crew video down! He asks for it all day. He's always sure to pack in his backpack (along with his favorite teddybear) whenever he's visiting family. It's definitely his favorite video.
When I saw the video for the first time I was amazed. The characters really come to life; the computer animation is fabulous! This is a terrific video for kids who love construction. Cody's Crew is a winner.

8147743,5,B000IY06SO,"IT IS WONDERFUL! We loved it!  Using construction vehicles for the characters is the ultimate for kids, they just eat that stuff up.  Also, the video has a very clear and strong lesson. Which should be a major part of the purpose for letting kids watch videos. It clearly shows kids that tasks at hand can be completed more productively through organization, cooperation and planning. So many kids videos are empty or try to teach a lesson but are not clear enough.  This video clearly delivers the point.
We also loved the fact that despite the fact the characters were working on a noisy construction site, there were moments of quiet, and voices were lowered with soft music which presents a great contract and prevents kids from getting wound up and loosing the message.  We also chuckled at some of the antics of some of the characters.

Thank you so much for the video, we will treasure it.",1003276800,4,896,4.6455696202531644
