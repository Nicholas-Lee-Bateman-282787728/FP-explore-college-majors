This movie is set in rural England. A young man, Larry Talbot, travels to a Gypsy encampment. A wild animal attacked him. Larry killed it with a club, but Larry suffered a bite. Later, strange things happened when the moon was full. Larry turns into a hairy beast who attacks and kills other people. Is there no way to end this terror? An expert tells it will take a ""silver bullet"" to kill this demon. An so a tortured soul is stopped from killing again. This film had a bigger budget than the earlier horror films, and shows it. Hollywood was sure an audience would buy it. The horror was lessened as well, as if to anticipate censorship.

I read that writer Curt Siodmak invented many of the legends now believed authentic: silver bullets, garlic, a cross to repel vampires, etc. Decades earlier the Silver Bullet could symbolize the silver currency demanded to save many people from a deflated currency in the late 19th century. People had borrowed paper dollars and were forced to pay back with more valuable specie. The werewolf may also symbolize an economic system with recurring depressions that ravaged the people who were innocent bystanders. The economy was good most of the time, but then it turned into a horror. This was well understood before the New Deal Laws that regulated businesses and restricted the ability of Wall Street to ""fleece the lambs"" by selling worthless bonds and stocks. The repeal of the New Deal Laws over the past thirty years resulted in the High Tech Stock scams, then Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, and other swindles that impoverished people. The New World Order policy of NAFTA destroyed factories with good jobs at good wages for tens of millions of people. They now suffer from these designed disasters.

This film (and others) used to be shown on TV for many years from the late 1950s to the 1970s. A few years ago I read an article from two college professors who investigated the werewolf legends of past centuries. They found there was always an outbreak of rabies before these legends. Rabies is spread by wild animals such as wolves. Anyone who suffers from rabies will in turn attack and bite other people. Those with rabies suffer nerve damage so they avoid sunlight, and only come out at night. England has no wolves for centuries, and their laws require a strict quarantine of all dogs brought into their country. A ""talbot"" is a breed of dog.

Writers have noted the interest in horror films during an economic recession. Watching horror films with their eventual happy endings may serve as a cathartic to purge people's fears. The ""science horror"" films of the 1950s represented the fears of an atomic war. Dangerous monsters were a symbol for the atomic bomb. Some say the teenage horror films represent the fear of adult life and responsibilities. Teenagers, whether they like it or not, will grow up to be just like Mom and Dad. Or maybe Grandma and Grandpa, with their aches and pains and the remembrances of the way it used to be. Could these werewolf and vampire attacks also symbolize the rise in juvenile delinquency in the 1940s?",1505692800,,3141,4.779005524861878
