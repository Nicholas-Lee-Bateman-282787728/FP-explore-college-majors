It is very informative and entertaining with beautiful photography of the Welsh countryside and some very intimate live performances.  The transistion from Small Faces to Faces to Slim Chance is well represented and a 1987 interview with Ronnie, which is used throughout the show, brings it all to life.  There are also insightful commentaries by Pete Townshend, Eric Clapton and members of Slim Chance which capture the impact Ronnie Lane had on them, as Ronnie sought a life of making music outside the typical restrictions of the music industry.

The Life and Music of Ronnie Lane

105 min Documentary for Theatrical Film Release and Worldwide DVD

60min version for TV

Ronnie Lane

Ronnie Lane was an innocent who saw through status, pretension and hype. He turned his back on his massive material success, and all the commercialism of the music business, and went chasing ideals. He had more than his fair share of disasters, but until his final illness, he shook them off and started again.

Even when he was a superstar, Ronnie had the nerve to recruit musicians around the pubs, choosing them because he liked their attitude - not because of their reputations or even their skill.  With this approach he brought all sorts of diverse influences together, and is recognised as a powerful creative force. His music spanned Pop, Soul, Rock, Country and Folk.  Ronnie always played for the sheer joy of entertaining people, whether he had an audience of 12 or 12,000, but he also wrote some of the most heartfelt and haunting songs of his time.

Nowadays more than ever we need reminding of how to throw off the shackles of cynicism and materialism. We need Ronnie's example of living life as if it was a Passing Show - valuing people we meet for who they are not what we can get from them, enjoying giving more than receiving, and not taking ourselves too seriously.

Ronnie Lane's Story

Ronnie Lane started life as the archetypal East End urchin who became a pop star at 17. He formed the Small Faces and with Steve Marriott started one of the great songwriting partnerships of the 60's. Ronnie then became the chief songwriter and co-lead vocalist of the Faces, arguably the best live band of the Seventies.

At the height of their fame, the ""dapper"" Lane left the Faces, metamorphosed into a gypsy troubadour, and acquired a second hand circus tent and its fleet of ancient vehicles. He led his troupe of hippy musicians, runaways, clowns and acrobats on a ramshackle tour of the English and Scottish counties. Called The Passing Show -  it was a bold move, and although culturally successful, was a financial disaster. Moving to a hill farm on the Welsh borders, Ronnie licked his wounds and recruited a talented group of multi-instrumentalists. Not expecting financial success, he called them 'Slim Chance' and recorded a series of low key but critically acclaimed albums in his barn.

During this time, curious members of the Rock and Roll `A' list such as Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend would pay extended visits to see what their old friend was up to. Enjoying the anonymity, they found that Ronnie had been quickly accepted by the locals and the farm had become the centre of a vibrant cultural scene. The music adapted as well, with Lane increasingly influenced by Romany Gypsy culture, writing songs that were vignettes of country life and the characters around him. Eric Clapton says this time with Ronnie was a huge influence on his own songwriting.

Although respected by musicians young and old, Ronnie wasn't hitting the charts in the era of punk. The ever loyal Pete Townshend suggested they realise a long held ambition to record an album together. Ronnie was able to recruit an extraordinary cast of musicians to the project including Eric Clapton, Ian Stewart, Charlie Watts and the legendary producer Glyn Johns.

The resulting album, Rough Mix, still stands up as a classic rock record.

By the mid-Seventies, Ronnie was showing early signs of Multiple Sclerosis. As a child, he had witnessed his mother's decline from the same disease. His health began a twenty-year roller-coaster of decline and improvement, which effectively ended Ronnie's career as a player although it was far from the end of his story. In 1983 a stellar line up of musicians lead by Johns and Clapton got together and performed the ARMS (Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis) concerts. Originally conceived as a fund raiser for Ronnie's medical bills, it was typical of the man that he insisted the money went to MS Research instead.

He found his next home at the heart of the music community in Austin, Texas. He continued to write songs, and when he was well, he played gigs and radio shows with local musicians, often making brief but entertaining stage appearances when his old mates, like Ron Wood, passed through town.

He finally passed away in 1997 in a small town on the New Mexico-Colorado border.

Clearly, Ronnie was no saint - although he appears to have been loved by nearly everybody he came into contact with and managed to both delight and exasperate most in equal measure. As a musician, he continues to be hugely influential with several of his timeless songs now firmly established as part of our musical heritage.

About the film:

Rupert Williams and James Mackie have made this film as a labour of love over about five years. Although we were working in one of the technical departments of the BBC, we were not recognized as program makers, so we had to work as independents in our own time. Eventually we managed to convince the BBC Music Department that we were doing something very special, and we completed the film as a co-production with the BBC.

The film is an affectionate portrait of Ronnie, which spares no blushes about his faults. The core of the film is our interviews with Ronnie's friends, family and colleagues, plus Ronnie's own voice, edited from radio and TV interviews. Every single contributor knew Ronnie well. We've also taken great care to keep the interviews relaxed and natural, filming outdoors in rural locations as much as we can. We have filmed by the River Thames, in the Welsh borders, in Ireland, Texas and Colorado.

We have found plenty of never-seen-before archive footage of the Small Faces, the Faces and Slim Chance, including performances from Swedish and German TV, News footage from the 1970's, and a moving recording of one of Ronnie's last performances when he was very ill. We have also had access to wonderful collections of still photographs, particularly those taken by Russ Schlagbaum on the Passing Show tour.

The short BBC version of the film was shown on BBC4 (cable and satellite only) in the UK on January 6, 2006 and was one of the most watched documentaries in the history of BBC4.

The longer Theatrical Movie Version had its World Premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas on March 16, 2006 at the Austin Convention Center, as well as several other film festivals in 2006, as well as other theatrical runs and will be released on Worldwide DVD in late October 2006.

2660633,5,B000ION7CG,"Thrilling rock & roll tale of Ronnie""Plonk""Lane, bassist and songwriter of seminal British bands- Small Faces and Faces.  This documentary is of the highest caliber and was made by The BBC.  Worth the price of admission just for the television footage of both bands performing live.  True fans may shed a tear as Ronnie's health degrades from M.S.  But interviews from later in his life show that he was always cheerful and never lost his ability to enchant an audience.  A timely viewing now, with The Faces set to reform (minus only Mr. Lane).  Hugely enjoyable for any fan of 60's and 70's rock music.",1220313600,2,604,4.704761904761905
2660634,5,B000ION7CG,"Ronnie Lane was a complicated mix, for such a little guy! So much talent and so many contradictions; stubbornness tempered by philosophical humour; natural musicianship displayed with winning warmth; dazzling success followed by crushing hardship, feckless lunacy followed by hard-fought hereditory illness (Ronnie's mother had also battled Multiple Sclerosis). Ronnie braved everything life threw at him.

This engaging and often funny film traces Ronnie's amazing life, with insights from relatives and musician friends such as Pete Townshend (who shared RL's devotion to the mystic Meher Baba), Eric Clapton and Ian Maclagan. Interviewed in 1987, Ronnie provides much of the narration himself; laughing and finally quoting Meher Baba, 'Life is just a passing show'.

This is fascinating programme, peppered with many beautiful musical excerpts from Ronnie's time in Small Faces, The Faces and a solo career that should have been more successful. God bless, Ronnie. You are missed.",1220054400,2,983,5.680272108843537
2660635,5,B000ION7CG,"Probably the best overview of Ronnie's life you'll ever see. Ronnie was loved by everyone who knew him, and this ""biography"" shows why. I was introduced to him through his work with The Faces (not the Small ones). The songs he wrote while with that band showed a mature, gentle and insightful songwriter. His voice, while not strong, is a perfect fit for the songs he wrote. Interesting even for the casual fan, or the new fan as well. May he rest in peace.",1212537600,,457,4.4523809523809526

2660638,5,B000ION7CG,"Not many listeners know the music of Ronnie Lane. In his heyday you had to dig a little to find his records, and now his heyday is about thirty years passed. He died in 1997 of MS. There was never much flash about the guy, but his music was excellent and unique. The niche he occupied was a very particular one and, sadly, no one before or since has come close to filling it. His personal misfortune notwithstanding, Ronnie Lane wrote largely acoustic, glad-to-be-alive songs in which accordians, tin whistles and the like featured. This DVD tells his story pretty well and serves to give the viewer a sense of the music he made, though, as one reviewer noted, there isn't the first complete performance to be had. Given the dearth of material on Ronnie Lane, that can be forgiven. It's high time someone cut an inroad into this largely ignored territory, and I'm more than pleased to have it.",1176940800,3,893,4.5875
2660639,3,B000ION7CG,"I must admit to being somewhat disappointed with this DVD.

The greatest disappointment I have is that there is not a single musical Ronnie Lane performance on this DVD that is even close to complete. In fact almost all of them are only very short snippets. Now I realize that this DVD is designed mainly to tell the life story of the wonderful Mr Lane, I still don't understand why a couple of the live performances could not have been shown in their complete form. If the concern was upsetting the flow of the story of Ronnies life, then why not add some original complete performances as DVD extras ? Perhaps another DVD is in the works of live Lane material ?

Secondly, while there were indeed some interesting interviews ( like with his wives ), I must admit that all in all I learned very little from this DVD that I didn't already know. The DVD also seemed to slight the "" Faces "" portion of his career. ( possibly due to a Mr Rod Stewart )

All that being said, I am still glad I purchased this DVD, as ANY documentary of Ronnie Lane is welcome, and long overdue. There are some nice still photos of Ronnie during his career, and the brief bits of his interview from the 80's is certainly worth viewing and hearing.

Here's hoping that there is a "" Ronnie Lane Part 2 "" DVD in the works featuring only live performances.",1169769600,11,1329,4.346774193548387
2660640,5,B000ION7CG,"This is not just a typical story of rock and roll excess, nor is it a pious homage to yet another dead musician. This an inspiring exploration of a very complex individual struggling to balance his starring role as an amazing songwriter/musician in two of the most famous, and influential bands of our time, The Small Faces and The Faces, with his deeply felt spiritual aspirations (as a follower of Avatar Meher Baba).In the film, Ronnie Lane is portrayed first and foremost as a human being who courageously (foolishly) commits commercial careericide by following his heart to leave fame and fortune to travel around the countryside in a caravan playing the music he heard in his head... only to wind up in a valiant battle with multiple schlerosis. Throughout, Lane's talent, sincerity, humanity, courage, and importance prove as moving as the music itself. Perhaps a video compilation of some complete musical performances will follow? I hope...",1168473600,10,949,5.089743589743589
2660641,5,B000ION7CG,"Ronnie Lane is a national treasure. His influence on the music and culture of the sixties and seventies is greater than we have yet acknowledged - his philosophy could have spared us stadium rock if anyone had been listening.

This documentary tells his story well. There is sympathy without nostalgia. It is very well researched and well directed so that the viewer comes away with a sense of what Ronnie achieved and knowing the quality of the legacy he left. Most importantly it renews enthusiasm for Ronnie's music, it takes you straight to the songs and the attitude that they should be sung forever, wherever people get together to sing.

The tragedy of Ronnie's illness is that it denied us the chance to bump into a great old bloke sitting in the corner of a country pub telling stories about the band he was in that shook the world and playing us a tune or two on his twelve string guitar. If he's not here, we'll just have to play those tunes ourselves.!",1168300800,4,964,4.566473988439307
2660642,5,B000ION7CG,"This excellent DVD tells the fascinating story of Ronnie Lane, bassist for the Small Faces and the Faces, as well as a wonderful solo artist in his own right, from his birth to his unfortunate death related to MS.

Fans of classic rock will most likely have heard of Ronnie through his association with the first two bands--the Small Faces produced the hit, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Itchycoo-Park/dp/B000008KU7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Itchycoo Park</a>,"" and the Faces were Rod Stewart's original group, becoming wildly popular in America and having a few hits (many penned and sung by Ronnie).  The story charts his pivotal role in both bands as the spirit of both groups and a talented songwriter as well.  Excellent montages of photos and video clips illustrate the narrative, which includes interviews with bandmates, road crews, his ex-wife, and Ronnie himself.

The story gets really interesting when Ronnie leaves the Faces to pursue his own solo career, releasing albums recorded in his mobile home recording studio that have a home-grown feel (much like The Band).  Lane moved to a rural farm and had some mixed success at living an agrarian life while at the same time taking his band on a circus-like live tour called ""The Passing Show,"" which produced some unforgettable music but also ran his finances into the ground.  He also collaborated with Pete Townshend on the classic album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rough-Mix/dp/B000LV63SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rough Mix</a>&nbsp;in the later 70's.  Finally, the DVD charts Ronnie's life from the time he first became diagnosed with MS and quit working as hard and finally moved to the USA to live a quieter life raising money and awareness about MS and playing music (when he could) until he passed away.

Ronnie's story is told candidly and lovingly by his friends and musical cohorts, and it's not possible to watch the film without gaining a great appreciation for his character and his contribution to music in the 60's and 70's.  I was already a fan before I watched The Passing Show, but now I'm more inspired to dig deeper into Ronnie's catalog.  Hardcore fans will really enjoy the show, and you might even get interested in Ronnie without having heard his music just by watching this great documentary!",1168300800,3,2371,5.453551912568306

8146893,5,B000ION7CG,"Ronnie Lane was one of a kind. This is an excellent musical biography DVD, in fact one of the best I have seen in a while. While it suffers from the fact that the narration does at time distract from the music it is superb and one wishes that there would have been some more music. Lane had an incredible career and some very famous friends. Here we get to see the beginnings of the Smal, Faces on which too little time is spent and then the time with Rod Stewart in the Faces is dealt with rather shortly as well. This is probably normal since the film is more interested in his time with Slim Chance which is grat. Indeed there are other DVDs dealing with the more successful periods of his life. Slim Chance was the band he formed in order to perform a very different kind of music away from the mainstream then. It was folky gypsy-like music. Personally I came into contact with Lane through the album Rough Mix with Townshend which is simply splendid and which is referred to here. I discovered the Slim Chance LPs at the store Back to Mono and they were fantastic records, quite unique and they had this unique blend of folk and traditional music such as country that made them really great. This decision, while artistically great, was commercially a folly and he went bankrupt of course. All this is recounted in great detail by his friends such as Clapton, Townshend and Glyn Johns among others. we get to follow the great man s career as well as his battle against multiple sclerosis. This is a great documentary in the vein of what British television does best and serves as agreat tribute to a unique artist.",1282262400,,1620,4.457912457912458

Ronnie believed in life, music, friends, and having a good time, despite tremendous obstacles and hardships. You'll definitely want some Ronnie Lane music to accompany this. I would recommend starting with Just for a Moment, You Can Never Tell, or Kuschty Rye depending mainly on which is more easily available. Rocket 69 is a fine live performance, while his four original albums are also all good. Of course, his Small Faces (esp. Ogden's Nut Gone Flake), Faces (esp. A Nod is as Good as a Wink), and collaborations (esp. Rough Mix), are also good to excellent, although his solo recordings probably offer more insight into his musical personality vision. But, even if you are not familiar with, or perhaps don't care that much for, Ronnie Lane's music, the Passing Show is still a highly entertaining movie.",1265241600,,899,4.960264900662252

Even after major success Ronnie Lane , Kevin Westlake and others remain true to their roots and create music for the sake of music and not dollars.

I have only recently come to Ronnie Lane's music, even though I was a Small Faces fan as  a kid and also a big Who fan. But when I heard Rough Mix all those years back... well I was just too immature. For my money Ronnie Lane is along with Townes van Zandt, Gene Clark, and Mickey Newbury one of the greatest songwriters of the last fifty years - and like the others mentioned here, his albums (outside of the work with the faces and Small Faces) are found in relatively few collections. Of the names just mentioned Lane is the only Brit, and as far as I can recall the only person in the UK at the time writing the kind of music that would so comfortably fit in Austin. No wonder Joe Ely became a friend and fan when Ronnie went to live in the States. And yet there is also something the comes from the British ale which accompanies this tinker's cart weaving its way through these lovely stretches and bends on life's way.

I understand the complaint of one of the reviewers here who is pissed that there is no complete performance by Lane  in the movie. But what there is is a great slice of the feel of the music, which made me go off and buy everything by him I could get my hands on -  now I can't take them out of my cd player. The songs are so full of beauty, so life affirming, and glowing with love that you feel you just want to grab a guitar, or violin or damn thing you can get your hands on and jump on that old passing truck with them.

 From what it seems, everybody loved Ronnie Lane and I can't imagine anyone not seeing this movie and not doing likewise.",1227657600,,1783,4.162790697674419
