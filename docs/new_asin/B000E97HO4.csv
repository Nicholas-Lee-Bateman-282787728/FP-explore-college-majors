8107748,5,B000E97HO4,"I Love The Three Mesquiteers, in almost all of their configurations. But this group, the ""second set,"" is my favorite.  I hadn't discovered this serial until last year, and I've been hooked ever since! It really saddens me to see how undervalued, underrated and virtually ignored this serial is today amongst the Classic B-Western fan community.  This one is probably my favorite. The story/plot, the action and the acting are first rate. Its classic Saturday matinee. popcorn chomping goodness that will not disappoint!  Force your children to start watching it with you, and in 10 minutes they will become western fans too!",1509062400,,625,5.107843137254902

8107751,5,B000E97HO4,This is a terrific movie starring Robert Livingston. He and his friends own a cattle ranch from which their cattle are being rustled. But the culprits leave a slaughtered carcass making everyone think that bears from the Wildlife Preserve are killing their stock. Very good stunts in the movie also.,1403395200,,299,5.0
8107752,4,B000E97HO4,"The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezewood.

In HEART OF THE ROCKIES, Stony is framed for the murder of a National Park Service Ranger.
Also included is a Season 1 chapter of the TV series STORIES OF THE CENTURY, in which railroad detective Matt Clark meets up with a deadly young gunslinger.

8107753,1,B000E97HO4,"Always looking for a good western and this one is not it.  I guess that it is just too old and low budget.  Everything was stilted, including the actors and their lines.  Would not recommend watching.",1392681600,,200,4.5
8107754,5,B000E97HO4,"This is a different slant on cattle rustling. Takes action in National Park and shows a different - not so helpful - side of the park rangers. Being that early in the 1930's, probably on the truthful side of things also! Involves a not so friendly stepfather, and the kind Mesquiteers, and a couple of good kids caught in the middle. (A bit of the old 'Tennessee/Arkansas' hill type folk and some of their good ol' hill music was entertaining :) too.) It will keep you wondering about the outcome as the rangers take a dislike to the three 'heroes', the Mesquiteers and put the blame on them! Watch what happens! Good for family viewing. Leaves a bit of wondering what might of happened in a 'sequel'! :)",1345680000,,704,4.5078125

8107756,5,B000E97HO4,"Just as the Lone Ranger had his William Tell Overture, so this series had its easily recognizad music and is one of the most charming, ""tuneful"" bits of film composing ever. Had it been done at Disney or Warners, it would haved been up for a nomination. Only now are the children of Republic as I call my generation, realising how right we were in knowing there was something more than B/ Saturday entertainment here. The concept has never changed in trio casting, all the way to Gunsmoke, to Bonanza and even Star Wars, you have the dependable, mature big brother. the young reckless ""little"" brother, and the comic relief character. But as I have written elsewhere in these reviews, the crowning glory at Republic was its camera work and music scores. Along with WiliiamLava's Don Red Barry title/credit music, The ""Sceeters"" music rivals Bonanza's.
Otherwise any of the movies in this series is just what you expect and expect to enjoy. No dissapointment there.",1196208000,4,964,4.848484848484849
