The movie takes a very unusual look at the triangle.  If has a great cast, and the story line is easy to fallow.  There is enough action so as not to get board and it will leave you thinking about it for day after you watch it.",1375747200,,370,3.7662337662337664

8322389,5,B001MXVA7G,"The cast alone is worth the price of admission.  Eric Stoltz, Catherine Bell, Lou Diamond Phillips, Bruce Davison and thrown in for extra measure, Charles Martin Smith and Sam Neill.  First class production all the way.  The effects are top drawer.  The story is not the typical Bermuda Triangle fare and keeps you riveted throughout the close to 4 And 1/2 hour running time.  This is science fiction on a grand scale utilizing the mystery of the Triangle to great effect.  I enjoyed every minute and was on the edge of my seat at the end.  I wish more television of this quality (especially science fiction) were done today.  Now that SyFy has become the home of more reality driven fare and Saturday Night 'B' movies (not that 'B' movies aren't fun) than true sci-fi you won't be seeing anything of this quality anytime soon again.",1366934400,2,833,4.657534246575342
