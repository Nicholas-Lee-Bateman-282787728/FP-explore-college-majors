8450327,3,B004ZQ6CX4,"This bizarre rom-com from 2011 got rave reviews in India. In fact, it's childish, but fun. It's full of primary colours and silly misunderstandings. The action revolves around a couple that can't unite because various other partners-to-be keep getting in the way. At times the 2:12 hrs movie feels like a string of pop videos, or stand-up comedy acts. The acting is for impression, not for realism. Main actress Nithya Menon is partly cute, but often has to act too childishly stubborn and then again too nave. The final 20 minutes could be very dramatic, but first-time writer and director Nandini Reddy is more interested in simple jokes than in drama. Good clean fun for the intended audience maybe.

The five songs sound passable, but too electronic and and barely memorable (the Malayalam-dubbed version has different songs). There is just a bit of dancing. The story does not even occasionally try to be realistic, and the sound reminds you of the worst Bollywood productions: even when the actors talk outdoors and in a crowd, the voices bear the dry, dead sound of a cell in a dubbing studio. The film contains a lot of rapid talk and if you don't understand Telugu, it is difficult to follow the endless subtitles, especially as those titles contain lots of partly serious mistakes at least in my Aditya Video Bluray, bought in India. Some of the sidekicks act embarrassingly over the top. The camera rummages around extremely nervously, the editor used too many cuts.",1392768000,,1477,4.884462151394422
