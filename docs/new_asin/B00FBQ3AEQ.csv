5974363,5,B00FBQ3AEQ,"I've been watching this show since it started, the thing that kept my attention was that the family deals with realistic problems.

5974367,4,B00FBQ3AEQ,"It was interesting to see my favorite show's actors out of character. It was great to hear creator's
thoughts and processes for the various episodes.
Only reason for not giving it 5 stars was that it was distracting to try to listen to one
person, but hear others in background giggling, whispering, etc...Maybe would have been better to have
others turn off, but that probably is impractical. Good and worth the watch!",1383177600,,419,4.833333333333333

5974370,5,B00FBQ3AEQ,"Loved the show so watching the actors fill us in on the journey was special. The show itself  can really pull on the emotional strings so it was definitely well written. Fave characters were Adam & Kristina and would like them to do a spinoff

I tuned into watching Parenthood in the first place for Lauren Graham after watching her in Gilmore Girls - which turned out to be one of the greatest shows ever made in my opinion.",1457049600,,425,4.367088607594937
