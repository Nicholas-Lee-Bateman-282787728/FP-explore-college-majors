8545618,2,B009Z8TUYA,"I did not really care for this video at all. The dance part was too short and not challenging enough. I didn't even really work up a sweat. The warm up part seemed to go on for too long, too. The warm up part is decent, so I may do that part again. I think maybe a few minutes of warm up is great, but I wanted a good cardio session and I did not get that here. I found better youtube videos for free, so I will stick with those.",1458518400,,429,3.7252747252747254
8545619,4,B009Z8TUYA,"This contains lots of great stretches for pregnancy, but there are only a couple of dance routines. They are very simple. I use it more for the stretches than dancing.",1454198400,,167,4.6
8545620,3,B009Z8TUYA,"As a dancer, I appreciated the traditional warm up and attention to detail.  However the actual choreography portion was extremely easy (great for beginners), especially given my background.  It's a great video for those who like to dance but need the basics to be broken down and really simplified.  I was looking for much more of a challenging workout, a kind of ""dance workout for expectant dancers.""",1434412800,2,403,4.985074626865671
8545621,5,B009Z8TUYA,"I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it! The workout was just what I needed. I've tried other videos and this one is by far the BEST! And the customer service was amazing! They got back to me quickly and I got all my questions answered. I strongly suggest this!",1423008000,,246,4.25531914893617
8545622,5,B009Z8TUYA,"I love this workout! I love dancing and since being pregnant it's been hard to do so not knowing what is okay and what isn't. But, this DVD helped me tremendously! Now I can dance and stay healthy!",1396828800,5,197,4.2105263157894735
8545623,4,B009Z8TUYA,"Let me start out by saying that I love this dvd.  I found this work out much more fun and rewarding than other prenatal work outs I've done. The exercises are very gentle so a woman can do them no matter what stage of pregnancy she is in.  I feel the majority of the dvd is stretching, which is great for preparing for labor and delivery, and I could quickly see an improvement in my flexibility.  The dvd is split up into 7 warm up sessions, so you can easily skip back and forth to exactly what you feel like doing at the moment.  The dance part of the dvd was a little disappointing.  There are 3 mini dances you learn that are all fairly short.  Though they are very fun and easy to groove to, I would almost classify this more as aerobics in stead of dance.  I am pregnant now and have been doing this dvd nearly every day for a month now and plan on doing it until well after delivery.  I will also say that this is a great work out for someone who has never exercised regularly.  It is very easy and does not necessarily make your heart race,so if you are looking for something more challenging you might want to consider something else.",1384992000,2,1144,4.187214611872146
8545624,5,B009Z8TUYA,"Wow. I just completed Menina's prenatal workout for the second time this week and I am bouncing around the house! At five and a half months pregnant, you definitely have those moody, don't feel like working out, 'unpretty' days. Pregnancy is not only hard on the body, but can be hard on the psyche as your physical body changes along with everything else in your life! The group of women dancing with Menina are fun, lively and vivacious, and Menina herself has an infectious smile and feels like a friend! This doesn't feel like a gym aerobics class. It feels like you're dancing at home with your girlfriends - but dancing enough to make you break a sweat.

The fun and flirty dance moves incorporated here and there kind of make you feel like 'you still got it.' This might sound silly but when your body's changing so quickly, you still want to feel beautiful and sassy! Cheers to you Menina for creating a workout that uplifted my spirits and left me dancing around the house for hours after I finished. :)",1369440000,6,1012,4.56043956043956
8545625,5,B009Z8TUYA,"I am not a dancer.  In fact, I think I have horrible rhythm.  I love dancing, but I'm not good at keeping a beat and I'm not good at complicated step patterns.  Luckily for me, Menina is very easy to follow, especially when she breaks down each dance combo.

Firstly, I love the warm-up routines.  I've been doing yoga for over 12 years, and so I have a real appreciation for a good stretching.  Stretching is very important while pregnant and sometimes, it's all you feel like you can do!  The warm-up routines (all together) would be a great wake-me-up first thing in the morning and also perfect for right before bed. I like to stretch before bed.  Being pregnant is often exhausting and you feel sore or tired or cramped nearly all over.  A good stretch will revitalize your muscles and is a great way to end a long day.

The dance combos, again, are easy to follow with Menina's step by step instructions.  And they are not too hard or rigorous, but if you feel up to it, you just dance more energetically (work it!!!).  I was glad to see a lot of hip movements, the figure eights and lots of rocking/swaying of the hips.  This motion is great while pregnant as it relieves back pressure and helps rock baby into a good position for delivery.  Like the warm-up routine, these dance combos can easily be done throughout the day as you feel in the mood to dance/relieve pressure from your growing belly/just take a load off and have some fun! Dancing in the kitchen, dancing in the living room, having a dance party with your older children are all ways to incorporate more movement into your everyday activities.  More movement will lead to a healthier pregnancy and a healthier you!  Plus it's fun!

I really really really like that Menina's background dancers are not ""dancers"" either!  They are regular girls just like me!  Also, I'm always grateful for the modified stretching poses or dance moves for the later months of pregnancy.  Seriously, sometimes it's all you can do to stretch to your calf instead of all the way to your foot.  And that's ok! :)

A healthy pregnancy should include some healthy, low-impact exercise.  The smooth, fluid movements of Menina's dance workout are a fun way to help you stay fit while pregnant!
