8218483,5,B000VE43GM,"I bought this movie because I saw the guys from thatguywiththeglasses.com riff on it at a convention and it looked hilarious. Watching it without the guys talking over it isn't as much fun, but the movie is still a lot of fun. The plot doesn't make much sense, but that doesn't really matter. I still laughed most of the way through. The ""updated"" special effects do look like they were done in a high school computer class in the early 90s, but that's part of the movie's charm....especially when the turtle man oogles the pretty girl. If you watch it, you'll see what I mean. I would definately pick this movie up if you can find a copy. Amazon was the only place that I could find that had it.",1309392000,,696,4.361538461538461
8218484,5,B000VE43GM,This movie is AWESOME! I watched it several times and each time I am thoroughly entertained. It's not the most well produced movie in the world but it's far more accurate to the source material and far more enjoyable than Dragonball Evolution. The cheesy silliness in the movie makes it accurate to the fun nature of the Dragonball anime.  They should have just simply done a remake of this movie since Dragonball Evolution is trash compared to this.,1306540800,3,450,4.769230769230769
8218485,1,B000VE43GM,"Unless you have to examine all Dragon Ball related items, you should avoid this movie at all cost.

For die hard DB fans, go for it, but the movie is bad, and this DVD production is even worser.",1287705600,,194,4.105263157894737
8218486,5,B000VE43GM,"After watching the 2009 Dragonball movie and thought wow that was the worst thing I've ever saw. I watch the 1989 movie. It may be bad cheesy and horribley done....but it was 20 years previously. 1989 had ET quality movies or Gremilins. I watched this movie and laughed out loud (LOL) and almost rolled on the floor while laughing (ROFL). The one thing this movie did Kao Ken x10 better then the 2009 Dragonball movie was actually follow the story line of the First Season of Dragonball.

Given it didn't follow it exact it was still along the lines I could tell who the charecters were supposed to be. Hollywood did it and did not touch it close other than the names.",1257811200,,668,4.475409836065574
8218487,2,B000VE43GM,"this movie is almost a shot for shot remake of dragoball curse of the blood rubies  and thats a bad thing. they complained that dragonball evolution was bad because it wasn't close to the sourse matterial well this was as close as you can get except the names other then that its a shot for shot remake. dragonball just can not look good on film if its that close to the source it just dosent work.

you want a good db movie go see db evolution its great<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragonball-Evolution/dp/B00260HH3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragonball: Evolution</a>",1247443200,,611,5.630434782608695
8218488,1,B000VE43GM,"I am a dragonball fan.  I have watched most every episode of dragonball, dragonball z and dragonbal gt.

This live action movie is really pretty awful, but it does actually follow the script of the movie on the Dragonball - the Saga of Goku boxed set.  Strangely that movie retells the opening as a movie instead of as a series of episodes and is itself awful.

In the episodes, goku is a true hero.  He shines.  He is fearless and caring right from the start.  In the movie (both animated and this one) he is really no better than yamcha!  Further, there is almost zero character development in the movie, so you honestly just don't care about any of them.

I wouldn't let anyone I know watch either movie if I had any hope of them getting into the rest of this series.",1247097600,,770,4.328671328671328
8218489,3,B000VE43GM,"With Fox getting ready to release a new-live action adaptation of Dragonball, I decided to go out and purchase the first live-action Dragonball film, which was made in China (without the consent of Akira Toriyama) and released near the end of the 1980s.

I wasn't surprised to find that this film is bad. Really bad.

Well, okay, I will admit that it's one of those films thats so bad it's good, but it absolutely butchers the original concept damn near beyond recognition. The Dragon Balls are called Dragon Pearls, Goku and his friends face off against a Power Rangers reject and foot soldiers with bad 80s hair, and none of the characters are named correctly (and in most cases are only vague shadows of their source material counterparts).

The film is so low budget that it steals its musical score directly from other things (the music used when Goku rides the flying nimbus for the first time is lifted wholesale from the animated series Ranma 1/2).

This is the kind of film that fully deserved to appear on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Even sans a riff track, the film is intensely (and most probably unintentionally) funny.

If you're the sort of person who likes bad films that are unintentionally funny, you'll laugh until you cry whilst watching this (my best friend actually got a nosebleed because he was laughing so hard).",1209945600,22,1339,4.779220779220779
