2863641,3,B000RAIQ9A,"This DVD gives a good overview of some of the features that a digital SLR camera offers, and seems to be directed a those of us who have been using point-and-shoot cameras.  It does a pretty good job of introducing P&S users to the most basic options that are available in an SLR, but it's only an introduction.  I watched it once and may watch it again, but I'm finding that I get more information from several books that do the same thing in much greater detail.  The DVD is probably as good a way as any to get started, but it won't take you very far. For that, you'll need a good book aimed at the beginning digital SLR user.",1212278400,9,629,4.181818181818182

2863660,1,B000RAIQ9A,"I'm a beginner, and this was of no use.  This is a complete waste of time and money unless you are from a cave and have never seen a camera (of any kind) before.  D-U-M-B !  Buy something else.",1223683200,5,193,3.8974358974358974
2863661,2,B000RAIQ9A,"A 45 minute DVD in which presenter Bob Krist explains some of his more favourite settings on the Nikon D200 camera and the way in which he puts them to good effect. This product is more suited to owners of the D200 if only because they will recognise the various camera features which are highlighted as Mr Krist uses them.

Whilst the content was interesting, I found it difficult to identify exactly which category of photographer at whom this DVD is aimed. If, like myself, you have just purchased your very first DSLR (Digital single lens reflex camera) and are wondering where to start, I would suggest this is not the DVD for you. If, however, you have started to take some decent photos, it should help you progress onto slightly (but only slightly) more advanced techniques. If you are already well down the road of taking excellent photographs using the many varied settings that are available on the modern DSLR then you will gain little from this product.

I really must register my overall disappointment. Just think about the product titles. Firstly we have a DVD from the ""Nikon School."" I would have thought the very word Nikon would ensure a content worthy of that name. But not so. Secondly, the DVD is called ""Understanding Digital Photography."" I may be a newcomer to the DSLR but, like Mr Krist, I too have sold my photography to National Geographic and I am also an award-winning author. My understanding of digital photography, however, was not enhanced by this product and my overall knowledge is no richer for my having studied the content closely.
