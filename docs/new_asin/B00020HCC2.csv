2052848,4,B00020HCC2,"This is Ellen Barrett's third Crunch Pilates video and the first which incorporates weights into the workout.  Similar to in her previous video, Crunch Fat-Burning Pilates, many of the traditional Pilates floor exercises are performed here in a standing position, although Burn & Firm Pilates does include a separate matwork section (see below).  The workout begins with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of simple movements such as marches and plies (there are A LOT of plies in this video!).  Following this, there was a 7-minute segment that is difficult for me to define; it was too slow-moving to be cardio and might best be described as light toning.  In this section, there are additional plies plus some basic ballet-inspired leg movements.

Next comes the ""meat"" of the workout, a 24-minute cardio segment using light weights to increase the workload.  The first series includes alternating side leg lifts (the ""saw"") with a ""swan"" movement that involves raising one arm overhead and lifting the opposite leg.  Although Ellen stated that we should be feeling this in our inner thighs, I found that it was actually my OUTER thighs and hips that were burning! Next comes more plies interspersed with two moves from the Pilates side series, rond de jambe and leg circles, both performed in a standing position.  Continuing on, there is a segment involving knee lifts which turn into lunges and combine with a front arm raise.  After that, it's back to MORE plies!  This time, a standing Pilates arm zip is performed in-between sets.  The finally cardio segment provides even more work for the arms:  you will do a front and side mambo that turns into a front and side lunge (a bit awkward to the side) while performing bicep curls the entire time.  The cardio section ends with a few additional exercises for the arms such as circles.  Overall, I found the intensity of the cardio to be about the same as for the cardio segment of Crunch Fat-Burning Pilates, although this would not have been the case without using the weights.

The final 8 minutes of the video are performed on the floor, starting with arms and abs work in a seated position with the weights.  Next, you move on to your back for two additional exercises, knee drops and leg straddles, using the weights as anchors.  Finally, there are just two traditional Pilates matwork exercises, the single leg stretch and the single straight leg.  The workout ends with a very short (1-2 minutes) cool-down in a seated position for a total of approximately 44 minutes.

I enjoyed this video and liked the addition of the weights, especially since I have been trying to add light weights to many of my cardio routines.  What I did NOT like was the absence of a traditional Pilates matwork sequence; I would have much preferred to leave out the light toning segment early in the video and devote this time to mat exercises instead.  Although the exercises are a bit more repetitious here, most fans of Crunch Fat Burning Pilates will probably enjoy this video as well.",1093305600,156,3025,4.834951456310679
2052849,5,B00020HCC2,Excellent video to strengthen and tone your entire body. A complete workout in the comfort of your own home. I have several of Andrea's videos and love her.,1475539200,,156,4.607142857142857
2052850,5,B00020HCC2,"If you are wanting a little bit of cardio, core strength and to build long, lean muscles on every part of your body this is the workout for you. The workout cycles through the moves in segments. So you do 3-4 moves about 3 times and then move on to another set of moves. I is 35 minutes of standing workouts then 10 minutes of mat/floor work for a total of 45 minutes. This workout left me sweating and kept my heart rate up though it was not a lot of cardio. This is one I will definitely be doing often for results.",1474848000,,517,4.029126213592233

2052857,5,B00020HCC2,"Love everything Ellen Barrett has done. She is a great, knowledgeable, motivational instructor. Her voice and style are perfect for the purpose. She is natural and her ""choose your level"" style makes you feel like you can get through the entire session having done the most of it. I like training at home because I do not like comparisons with people who seem they were born and raised in the gym. Very recommendable.",1441670400,,417,4.726027397260274

2052861,5,B00020HCC2,Can't really go wrong with Ellen Barrett.  This is an older workout but definitely a good one.  I felt it the next day.,1427846400,,119,4.130434782608695
2052862,5,B00020HCC2,"Netflix quit carrying this work-out, so glad to find it again.  Great for firming and toning, flexing the knees. Good moves that are different from the average gym fare",1425600000,,168,4.793103448275862
2052863,4,B00020HCC2,"I have a long history with this DVD.  When I first tried the workout back in 2004, I didn't keep it because it seemed overly repetetive to me., But then I reacquired it at some point later when I bought a 3-DVD set of Ellen's Crunch workouts and I found over time that I really enjoy doing this workout once in awhile. I still don't like how she repeats everything on both sides, but I enjoy the light weight work with the fusion type flow. And, it's a standing workout, something that I prefer over floor work.

Although the workout happens on a typical Crunch set with typical Crunch background exercisers, I find that I focus on Ellen in this workout and don't mind them as I usually do. Doing this workout gives me a glow. My arms feel well worked out using 2-3 pound workouts, although I would classify this more of a cardio workout than a strength workout. If you like either cardio or strength without mixing them (as I did at the time of my original review), you won't enjoy this. But, if you like a mishmash of styles, then this might be for you.

Ellen really sells this being a standing Pilates workout. I don't necessarily think that it is a Pilates workout, more of a Pilates inspired workout. She's encouraging and enthusiastic in this workout.",1425600000,3,1258,4.460869565217391

2052865,5,B00020HCC2,"I loved this pilates/cardio based workout video from Ellen Barrett. I actually picked it up for the first time several years ago when I was in college. I loved this workout. It's not incredibly intense... light cardio with weights. It focuses on using your own body weight and controlled motion to tone muscle and burn calories. As a college student at the time - I didn't have a large space to work out in and I was able to still do this work out in a small space. Even when I was in shape - this workout still made me feel the burn, and I still use it today.",1423872000,6,560,4.146788990825688
2052866,5,B00020HCC2,I love Ellen Barret's workouts!  I have to say now that this is my favorite.  I actually look forward to this one.  The music is great and you really do get a full body workout.  Toning and cardio =breaking a sweat!  Can't ask for more!  Thank you Ellen!,1422489600,,254,4.1875

2052868,5,B00020HCC2,Great workout.  I find myself getting a great sweat.  I enjoy the pilates and find that the more I do it the better I am able to mimic her moves. ..I feel the burn in the thighs.  I love the threading stretches to.  Personally helps me release alot of tension in shoulders.  Ellen Barret workouts challenge without killing me as some other workouts do.  In turn I get more committed to doing this workout. ..I rotate my workouts. ..but do enjoy this,1422057600,4,449,4.414634146341464
2052869,5,B00020HCC2,Decent workout.  Not too repetitive.  Good for those bad weather days when you need to stay in or at least once a week for some overall toning.,1421798400,,143,4.2592592592592595

2052871,5,B00020HCC2,"I recently bought this for my daughter who just had a baby.  She was complaining that the workouts she did before baby were just a little too intense yet.  I have been using this workout a couple of years now.  It's attainable for someone like me who needs to stretch and sweat a little without being coordinated.  It helps improve my balance, and I'm losing weight slowly.",1419292800,,373,4.522388059701493

2052874,3,B00020HCC2,"If you like forty minutes of plies, this DVD is for you. Otherwise, you're like me and you might find it boring and repetitive. I really like Ellen Barrett's fitness videos usually, but I've tried this one twice and both times just couldn't stave off the boredom. Admittedly, my quads were burning two days after the workout, but you can get the same effect by squatting through an entire episode of The Blacklist with much more entertainment value.

One thing I do like about this video is that is has a nice variety of people doing the workout with Ellen. Even *gasp* a man! Not just the twigs you might find in other DVDs. Crunch is always good about that, and this video continues the standard.",1417737600,,698,4.5396825396825395

2052883,5,B00020HCC2,I have 3 of Ellen Barrett's other Crunch (yoga/pilates) DVD's and was ready to try one with weights. I found this DVD to be enjoyable - not too strenuous but different enough for a good change of pace. She is a great guide if you like working out at home; friendly and upbeat without being manic. Runs about 40+ minutes like the other ones.,1407715200,,340,4.328125
2052884,4,B00020HCC2,"I felt I really got a workout. It's mostly standing exercises with some mat Pilates at the end.

Great fun workout, really focuses on the legs and core while getting the heart rate up there. Lots of ability to ramp up or step back. Definitely recommend.",1403049600,,353,4.363636363636363
2052890,5,B00020HCC2,"I've had this workout for years on VHS, just got the dvd version also. I'm 70 years old and have always been health conscious and I'll review this for people my age.

This workout is low-impact, no jumping or anything that would be hard on your feet. There are a lot of squats and lunges, though; if you have bad knees that could be a problem. Three-pound weights are optional and you will need a mat or towel for the floor exercises. The video gives you a cardio and Pilates workout with abdominal floor exercises at the end. Ellen Barrett is pleasant, background music is fine, the pace is perfect for me-challenging but not too difficult. It runs about 45 minutes and when I'm finished I feel a little tired but mostly energized. I have several exercise videos, but I always come back to this one.",1400544000,3,800,4.47945205479452

2052895,3,B00020HCC2,"The first 20 minutes are good.  Not too difficult and use of light weights.  But after that she keeps doing her fav ""trick"" the squat/plies - so many times that it is not only really boring, but bad for your knees.  This from a former gymnast and dancer.  The floor work is ok, but she doesn't do any leg work - only more arms and abs.  She, like many nondancer trained instructors, likes to call certain moves ""Pilates"" when they are not, in fact true Pilates moves.  Joseph Pilates created moves in the 1950's for  injured people to regain strength.  Many of those moves have been used by dancers for warm-up for 1/2 a century or more.  To do Pilates moves which are meant to be done sitting - standing up - is just fraud!  Stop calling things ""Pilates"" just to be trendy; it is just wrong.  And Ellen does not explain the Pilates technique well enough.  It is all about control and posture and her too many squat-plies would make Joseph Pilates roll over in his grave!  If you want true Pilates - get some ballet-based dvds or Mari Winsor's original dvd set.  This one will be sold on Ebay since I can't bear to do more than the first 20 minutes.  I'll stick to the Kari Anderson Floor - that is a real workout using real posture, control and technique.  If you do that one correctly, you will definitely notice a huge difference between that dvd and this one.",1393286400,2,1363,4.370517928286852

I know resistance training is a necessity but I'm resistant to weight lifting.  I have done it a various points in my life and I just can't seem to make it stick.  I have been looking for alternative resistance type training.  I have done traditional Pilates at a studio and love what it does for my core but don't feel the overall resistance training benefits.  I have done barre classes which I enjoy and feel benefit the lower body.  This video incorporates some of the moves I've seen in barre type classes with more arm movements.  I will definitely be going back to using it on weekly basis.  Though I will say if you are used to traditional Pilates mat workout that's NOT this CD.  This does get my heart rate into the 70% range of maximum heart rate on average so I got some cardio benefit as well.,1383782400,2,982,4.282608695652174

I found the weights section to be hard on my wrists--a lot of times you are just holding the weights at your hips--perhaps wrist weights would work better instead of dumb bells.  (I was using 5 lb weights and she recommended 2 lb, so that could be part of the problem).  There was also A LOT of repetition--great if you are slow to catch on, but rather boring for everyone else.  I would prefer a greater variety of moves.  Not a bad DVD, just not one of my favorites, especially when her other DVDs (Pick Your Level, Pick Your Spot, etc.) are so fantastic.",1363564800,,707,4.358778625954199
2052914,4,B00020HCC2,This is a great video to work you to a sweat.  I like that it's not too hard but hard enough to work you where you feel you had a work out.  They use weights so you feel like you are getting a work out with it.  I also like how it mixes it up with a mat work out so you kinda get a 'wind down' after the intense cardio work out.,1360713600,,328,3.4657534246575343

The back cover of this dvd claims that it is a ""low impact"" workout, well thats a lie. This video is for people who already workout. Why do they keep making videos for people who are already in shape??

My personal impression on the instructor: She is very impersonal and has a fake smile plastered on her face. I liked her better in another workout video, but she still isn't known to explain workouts clearly. She has a lot of videos out right now, she should stop and focus on the quality of her instructions instead of making hundreds of videos just to make money.",1359158400,2,694,4.464566929133858

It was more challenging than I expected. Since I workout at home, I try to rotate my workouts as much as possible to keep things fresh. I am trying to shift away from ""beating my body up"" with high intensity workouts, but low impact workouts can be too easy when you are accustomed to HIIT type workouts. This workout makes me feel like I actually did something because I sweat. The difference is that there is no pain. The steps are simple and the moves are easy to pick up so you won't get frustrated. This is one to keep in the rotation.",1356566400,3,696,4.4453125

I'm not very coordinated, but I never lost a step.  It's an adaptable routine, so I can work up to using weights.  (Right now, the workout's hard enough as-is.)  It's a hard workout (for a beginner--don't know how tough it would be for someone really in shape) but just when I start thinking, ""I can't do this anymore!"" she moves on to something else.

I have minor irritating knee pain so I was very careful not to overwork my knees as there are a lot of lunges.  I lost almost 20 pounds in 6 months with this workout being used a good part of that time.  It really shaped my arms, abs (which I thought were hopeless) and my legs.  I did not know who Ellen B. was before this workout and I really like her. She's normal and normal looking.  She's got a good voice and decent music. I stongly reccommend it!

The people behind her working out are great. I did 15 mins today and really felt every stretch immediately. This workout DVD is perfect for a beginner and for someone who is slow to pick up on cues as I am. She does each set for the perfect amount of time. This will be a regular workout DVD for me along with Cardio for Beginners by Petra Kolber and Dance off the Inches: Hip Hop Party with Jennifer Galardi so I don't get bored doing the same thing. I have to build up to finishing the entire workout and to using 3 lbs weight. I started with nothing today. This DVD excites me to work out to get into shape!

2052945,5,B00020HCC2,"I bought this DVD because I love her Super Slimdown Yoga/Pilates mix, and I didn't know what to expect with this one. I was pleasantly surprised. After the first time of doing this video, I was really sore, mainly in my thighs. There are a lot of difficult moves if you have bad knees, Plies and lunges. After 40 minutes, I'll burn about 430 calories. The gym workout seems much less appealing, and this is something that's actually enjoyable. I have asthma, and usually spending my time running on the treadmill or exercising on the elliptical is very difficult for my breathing, but this is really great because she teaches you how to breath while you're doing the exercises. Her group of women/1 man look a little fake. I was a little annoyed with her voice after the few times I did this video, I turned the volume down and listened to my own music and I worked out a little harder.

She tells you when to breath which is a big deal for people that forget when they are working out.  The pace was decent too.  You would have to do this everyday to see tremendous results, but I do believe even doing it a few times a week it will help you lose weight along with proper diet.  Some of the dance steps in the beginning were complicated for me but that's because I have no coordination.  All in all I will work out to this dvd.",1321056000,,570,4.222222222222222
2052947,4,B00020HCC2,"Just to establish where my background: I work out 5-6 days a week, during which I alternate cardio-heavy days with strength-heavy days. For example, for my strength-heavy days I do Jillian Michaels DVDs (Killer Buns and Thighs/Ripped in 30 + Six Week Six Pack OR Biggest Loser Last Chance Workout), plus a light jog in the evening; on my cardio-heavy days, I do a longer jog, but I also like to do about half of the strength training I do on my full strength days, so usually I will do my longer jog and then Six Week Six Pack. I am 27 and on the smaller side of the proper BMI for my height, and I don't have any injuries that prevent me from doing anything, although I have lived with weak knees for a long time ever since I cracked both my knee caps when I was a kid. I point this out because I know a lot can change when you're older or have serious injuries or overweight, so I know not everyone is going to have the same reaction.

In June and July my life was taken over by the Bar exam. When it was finally over, I was ready to get back into actual physical activity (not just walking at a giant incline on the treadmill), but I knew from past experience that if I just dove into where I left off, I was going to hurt myself or I would hate it so much I wouldn't be able to keep it up because it would just be too much. In the past, I had stuck to cardio on the treadmill and elliptical and free weights, but I tended to go full-throttle and leave the gym just dragging and feeling exhausted. I had done Pilates classes before, but those consisted of mat work and bored me to tears, even though I ""focused on my core"" and held my belly button in, etc. I didn't even break a sweat. I never had any desire to go back to Pilates. But when I was going through workout programs trying to decide how to get back into regular activity, Burn and Firm caught my eye because it mentioned cardio. I thought this could help me get more out of Pilates without killing myself, so I started the DVD.

Right away I knew this was not traditional pilates. I was actually sweating! This is definitely more pilates ""inspired"", and I think the ""pilates"" idea comes from the instructor telling you to make very deliberate moves, no swinging or anything. The movements and combinations are slower than I've done in aerobics classes, but everything is very controlled. Because of the slower pace, I was able to really engage my abs the whole time and focus on the muscle groups I was working. Thus, even the cardio circuit helps you tone, and not just burn fat. I started off using 5 lb weights, which was the lightest I had, and to be honest, I thought it was too much, and I usually use 8 or 10 lbs for workouts. When I moved down to 3, I was able to focus on the actual movement more, and I think I got a greater benefit.

Some people have complained about the repetition and that it's boring, but I think a lot of the ""results"" from the repetition, because that's how you tone muscle- repeating the same movement many times with lighter weights. The first day I did this, I definitely felt it the next day, but was not sore like I used to be when I left the gym after my turbo strength training. I started branching out to the Cardio Pilates workout, also through Crunch, and then started incorporating more strength-training workout videos. A couple months later, I am doing Jillian Michaels workouts and jogging outside, but I still like to use Burn and Firm one or two times a week, usually the day after I do Buns and Thighs (because yikes!). It's one of my ""easier"" workouts, but I still see the benefit in it.

People also complain about the lack of matwork, and that they don't really get an ab workout. But if you really do work on lifting your rib cage and keeping your abs tight, I think you will still get the toning on your abs.

I've recommended this to my mom, who is a little overweight and has bad ankles. She hates ""working out"" but still wants to get into shape. I think this is a good regular workout for people who are beginners or have a lot of physical issues that slow them down. If you're intermediate, I recommend adding this to your other, more challenging workouts.",1319068800,5,4180,4.286075949367088

This is somewhat similar to some of her Studio workouts--you can she was developing some of those workouts here.  I like that is low impact but gives a strong cardio workout and includes solid strength training.  A lot of the workout includes arms working with the weights at the same time that you are doing some complimentary leg moves.

I constantly check time on ANY video I have done and yes I did it with this one as well but by the time I first looked it was almost over... surprise. Yes, I agree with some when they say it is not intense, however, it was refreshing and I felt amazing afterward. I felt so invigorated I went for a 1/2 mile jog with the dog afterward. Not because I felt I needed it but because I felt so energized by the video. It was a refreshing change from feeling wiped after the gym, focusing on nothing more than a shower. I did feel it a bit in my legs the following day. This is a squat intensive video or plies(sp?) which is another nice word for modified squat. Though there were weights for arm work, I had to up the weights to really feel anything as the majority of the focus is on the lower body. I was so surprised that I enjoyed the mat portion which fortunately for me is short, aprox. 10 min.

Still, I wanted something to add to my kickboxing, yoga, and Zumba; something else that would give me a total body workout without leaving me feeling like I just got my ass kicked. I started feeling the workout during the warmup! Ellen has a pleasant, and gently enthusiastic voice - and she gives timely cues for her smooth and easy, yet challenging moves. I broke a sweat, I was breathing heavily, but never did I feel like I needed to stop. There were some times when I felt my knee grinding from all the lunges and plies, but I would just adjust my stance to release some of the pressure. The matwork was great too, just long enough, but not overkill at the end. 40 something minutes went by before I knew it.

I was never so out of breath that I couldn't talk.  The DVD is about 48 minutes and was so easy to get through.  I was never bored or ready to turn it off and lay on the couch.  I have many other Crunch DVD's and they are all instructed clearly.  Sometimes, I can't follow other DVD's because the instructors don't give clear instructions in enough time to follow them correctly.  Crunch videos give you a cue to change your movements in plenty of time allowing you to stay on pace.

The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because one, this video does not include a lot of focus on arm or abdominal areas.  There is a short segment for abdominal at the end of the video, but I feel it is not intense enough, nor long enough, but it's okay because I always add extra abdominal workout when I'm done with the video.

I am very impressed with this workout. You really feel the burn and feel that you are getting a workout. The light weights get your heart pumping but is not overdone so you really feel that you are in the fat burning zone.

Ellen's personality is wonderful. She is cheerful but not overly perky. Her instructions are great and she really tells you how each move should be executed so you are performing it properly.

I think some of the moves/combo's could be combined so that there could be more of a variety involved, but that is just my opinion.

Despite the overabundance of squats, I enjoyed the ballet moves, the aerobic movements, the salsa dancing, and the floor routine. Plus the weights added to this routine really boosted my workout.

In my opinion its really more cardio than pilates. Don't expect a lot of mat work - there's actually very little. The majority of the workout is done standing up. As far as low impact cardio goes, this one does quite well. While it's not going to get your heart rate up as high as say running or cycling, it does better than I expected it to. Nothing is overly challenging - most people should have no problem doing this one - but you do feel like you accomplished something by the end.

I disagree 100%, and I am in pretty good shape - I work out at home 3-5 times a week doing cardio and weight training together (usually with The FIRM workouts). After doing this video once, I was sore for 2 days - it works your core, arms and inner and outer thighs like mad.

BUT it is key that you pay attention to form when doing the movements - if you're just kind of going through the motions without consideration to proper form, posture and breathing then no - it's not going to be nearly as effective.

This video is in my rotation now and I plan on doing it at least once a week, mixed in with The FIRM videos - which I HIGHLY recommend. I only gave it 3 stars but it really deserves 3 1/2 - the cueing is great, the camera work is good, the set is crisp and clean, the music is fine - but as some other reviewers have also said, the cardio segment does get a little repetitive and that's where the real work is - it could use some variety in the movement sequences.",1219968000,5,1121,4.114155251141552

This is my first Ellen DVD and I think it's a wonderful 50-60 minutes home workout.  Pilates incorporates several moves into one so it's an efficient form of exercise/toning/cardio.  Ellen uses 3 lb weights and most of the DVD is standing up working legs/inner thighs/arms with lunges and plies.  Stomach/core areas are addressed through pulling in abdomen during standing part and during the last 10 minutes of floor work while doing pilates leg moves combined with crunches.  I'm not a person that enjoys exercising nor do I have that much space at home for jumping cardio routines.  This DVD had me breaking a light sweat in first 10-15 minutes so it's working and psychologically easier to get into after just crawling out of bed if you're not a morning person.

I would go to the gym regularly, but when I started going back to the office, juggling work and home got hectic, and I found it harder and harder to get dressed, drive,go to the gym,etc. The world of DVD workouts (though considered ""cheap"" by a lot of my friends) is fantastic for a busy work-outside-the-home mom like me. This way, I come home, can wear whatever I like, workout , shower, and not waste additional time outside the home. This DVD is my favorite workout. I did not lose weight at first, but my husband noticed my thighs, butt got firmer. I am on my first month since I started this DVD, and I have gotten more toned.
It's not super challenging, but you will get very toned. If you workout heavily in a gym, this may be a walk in the park for you. But for me, I usually ran, and did some weight training once in a while, and this was a good workout for me, and fun too. Not boring like in the gym

You have a choice whether to do the class with the instructor or follow one of the girls in the group (who does the class on a less intense level).  It's just as effective. You have to focus on the core.  That is the whole thing about pilates  - the core.  And to remember to breathe.  I listen to my pilate dvds 4 - 5 times a week.  It is less than an hour & I feel I get much from the lessons.  The more you watch the more it comes to you in case you missed a few things in the beginning.  You have to be consistent in order to get results.  It's easy to stick to because it's fun & in the house. I use them whenever I feel like it - either morning or night.

I'll post a review on winsorpilates to elaborate. Anyways, Ellen's programs ( I also have her pilates/yoga blend and love it) may only be pilates inspired but they gave me results. This burn and firm is a total body workout but it especially helped slim down my thighs; they don't jiggle as much and I fit nicely in those 'skinny' jeans. I really believe it's from the million plies in this video. I don't look forward to doing those plies but I remind myself of what those plies had done to my lower body. This is low impact and I sweat buckets when I'm done with this. This has compound exercises like the seesaw and the swan combination and that works the entire body.

Ellen Barret is an excellent instructor; she is enthusiastic enough without being obnoxious and she is great at giving little tips and form reminders throughout the workout. You can really get into the flow of the workout quickly so that you are able to maximize the effects in as little as 2-3 run-throughs. This one is a little more strenuous than some of the others.

There are lot of squats in it, so you will really tone up those inner thighs!  I can sometimes feel the strain for 2 days after I do this workout (not in a bad way....in that way you know you did an effective workout.)
[Side note: You might be leery of squats if you have screwy knees (I do); but with Pilates, you turn your feet slightly outward to decrease the torque on your knee joint.  Plus Ellen reminds you not to extend your knee beyond your foot, which will also help protect your knees.]
This will also help your balance, since it really helps strengthen your core.  (Now I can even shave my legs in the shower without balancing my foot on anything!  Not that I necessarily recommend this practice -- it could lead to some shower-related broken bones. I just thought I'd try it to test my balance.)
It's a good one to add to your collection, since it is a mix of cardio with pilates.  Perfect for the days I don't feel like getting on the elliptical/running or doing heavier weight lifting.  You get a little of both.",1195171200,2,1159,4.304147465437788
2052993,5,B00020HCC2,"Ellen Barrett takes instruction to new levels of perfection in Crunch Burn & Firm Pilates. I've rarely seen an instructor not only challenge me to my limits, but also keep me informed as to the next exercise so as to keep me in total harmony.

While doing this workout the first few times, you can modify most of the exercises by not using weights. When you do start using the weights it is invigorating and your heart rate will definitely be elevated to a fat burning zone.

There are quite a few completely unique exercises I have never seen in any workout. The ""swan extension"" is an artistic exercise you accomplish with two weights in hand. You almost feel like you are dancing with weights in some of the segments. Side raises with weights and lots of raising the arms and moving side to side raises the intensity.

Previous experience with Pilates and Ballet will make this workout especially intriguing for intermediate students of both. Ellen Barrett will often alternate between balance and control and then at times require you to balance while controlling the weights and movement of your arms in two different directions. The balance challenges in this workout are exciting and the hand-held weights make you feel much more powerful. The basic workout consists of:

A Warm Up
Standing Pilates - balance challenges
Standing Pilates with Weights - Your calves will feel the burn
Mat Work - lots of creative combos
Cool Down/Stretch

What will you need?

1 Mat or Towel
Two 3-pound weights

My knees seemed fine during this workout even with the lunges because Ellen makes sure to remind you to turn out your toes and to check to make sure your knee is not going over your toes. Still, if you have any knee problems you may want to avoid this workout.

If you are looking for a perfect warm up, high intensity cardio routine and progressive challenges, I think you will love this routine. The footwork is fairly easy with the coordination level being more challenging for your arms so you get a great arm workout. The precise movements give you a sense of control that is very satisfying.

If I had to have one critcism with Crunch tapes, it's that the camera roves too much and you don't get a chance to really look at the moves a lot, especially with the one who's supposed to be doing the low impact version.

Other than that, do buy this tape because you'll get a good workout with less strain and pain! Ellen Barrett is also a good instructor and not annoying as with some other instructors telling you to ""feel the burn!""",1176768000,2,729,4.360294117647059

I have some experience with pilates so I recorded that workout and have used it at least once a week for awhile. That workout appealed to me because it really worked the core, hips and shoulders as well as got my heartrate up. The All Star Workout really seemed tailored for preparing me for the golf season.  Unfortunately this Burn & Firm Pilates DVD did not turn out to be the good alternate workout I was looking for but instead a step backward. While this workout had several new exercises I liked, the general difficulty and intensity of the DVD were below that of the FitTv version.

To be more specific, this DVD typically burns about 260 - 270 calories, and I'm in my target heart zone for about 18 minutes.

The instructor is not perky in an annoying way.  I really like her and own all her other Crunch DVDs and use them all frequently.

I do this one three to four days a week, and alternate with Ellen's other Crunch Pilates Cardio DVD (can't remember the name, it's the one with the green cover).

I can't recommend Ellen Barrett's DVDs enough. I've tried a lot of exercise DVDs, but these are the only ones I've stuck with.

1.  Ellen Barrett is excellent at leading the workout.

2.  I have avoided traditional Pilates because I really enjoy something with a little more of an aerobic style - this constant moving routine using weights and Pilates inspired moves makes this possible.

3.  At the same time, as I get older, I want less ""jumpy"" style aerobics - this routine also makes this possible.

4.  By the end of this routine I have broken out in a full blown sweat.

5.  When I first started doing this routine I too thought it was repetitive, however, the more I did it - the stronger I got and now the segments fly by - although still remain challenging - and I actually look forward to this workout.

6.  And lastly, using this workout alone for the past 2 months (at least 4x a week - more if my schedule permits) and improving my diet, I have completely toned and reshaped my body.

I highly recommend buying this DVD - Just do it!",1155600000,59,964,4.318435754189944
2053023,4,B00020HCC2,I am a fan of Ellen Berret and enjoyed her fat burning pilates. Ellen is excellent with her timing. But I feel this work out does not concentrate much on the abs and the exercises are repeated. The pace and music does not let you feel bored. You do feel the muscles working and build up a good sweat.,1153785600,4,300,4.101694915254237
2053024,5,B00020HCC2,"I've been a devoted pilates practicer for over 6 years, and was somewhat sceptical about any kind of workout that tried to turn classic pilates into a more aerobic-type exercise. Still, I had an Ellen Barrett DVD (Self Sleek and Slim) and liked both the workout and instructor (she's extremely personable and has impeccable cueing), so I thought I would give this DVD a go. I'm very happy to report that I love it.

I think Ellen does an excellent job at applying pilates exercises to a standing and mat workout that makes you sweat. I love the feeling of simultaneously stretching & stengthening my body while also burning fat. And even though the routine moves at a relatively slow pace, as other reviewers have pointed out, the use of weights really gets your heart going. I'd rather move at a steady pace and do the moves properly (that's a pilates principle!) than flail around at a frantic speed, as is the case with so many workouts. Many people seem to think that unless it's really fast paced, you're not getting a good workout--and that's totally wrong.

I should add that I've always found weight training boring and have avoided it, so I'm very happy to have found a way to incorporate some into my workout. I also think that people with no pilates background can probably do just fine with this DVD, but you'd probably get more out of it with even some rudimentary instruction in pilates. I would recommend the Stott videos (also all excellent) starting with the beginner Pilates Mat workout.

I work out 4-5 times a week, and have been using this DVD at least 2 times a week for 6 weeks now. I still look forward to it.  Highly highly recommended.",1148860800,9,1661,4.601351351351352

I like the addition of the weights in this video and I do get my heart rate up during some segments, unlike many ""fat-burning"" videos that do not meet this claim.  My only concern is that I, personally, do not feel that the standing ab exercises are as effective for me as the mat-work in ""Pick Your Spot Pilates"" - perhaps I am not engaging my abs properly.  I feel that the addition of weights compensates in other ways with toning benefits and some elevation of heart rate, though.

The third part of the workout (the first part is the warm-up and the second is the standing up weight workout), requires you to be on a pilates/yoga mat (with your shoes off) and you'll still be using the weights for the most part.

This DVD is great espacially if you want to work your hips buttucks and thights.

I don't recommend this workout if you have problems with your knees. It requires a lot of squates and lunges.",1145836800,,789,4.458333333333333

It's true this workout can be a little tough on the knees, that's why I walk, not jog/run the rest of the week.  A couple of times my knee started aching so I stopped doing the video for about ten days.  Also, early on, using 3-pound weights  made my right shoulder joint sound funny so I switched to 2-pound weights and have had a very nice, still rigorous workout ever since.

I heartily concur with everyone below who praise Ms. Barrett and this invigorating workout.  When I started doing this video I had a completely sedentary lifestyle, 45 lbs overweight, and miserable.

The first thing that I really noticed and really like about this one is the consistancy and the excellent cueing by Ellen.  There are basically a few different sets of moves that she modifies and repeats throughout the video.  This makes it very easy to pick up on what she is doing and to keep up with her.  I don't like videos where I feel like a fool just trying to figure out what steps they are doing!!

Another thing about this workout is that it is very effective.  I mean, I get done with this one and my legs are really burning.  It definitely feels more like cardio than a traditional pilates exercise.

Other good things are that the music flows with the moves, the additional people with Ellen are in time, and the total length of the video feels just right.

I can't really come up with anything bad to say about this.  I guess that is why it deserves 5 stars!!",1144281600,3,1018,4.3052631578947365

I have advanced into their Yoga and alternate with the other ""Crunch Studio"" tapes through out the week for a total body workout.  They are alot of fun and the instuctions on doing the exercise are easy to follow.  Sometimes you don't even feel as if you are exercising.  The results are amazing for the little effort put forth.

2053034,5,B00020HCC2,"This was my third Crunch workout, the second with Ellen Barrett whom I really like. I have been a fulltime living room athlete since about 1988 finding it easier (and safer) to stick with than the jogging I used to do. I have been through Jane Fonda's aerobics (good at the time), the Step workouts (Cher Fitness was the most fun and a great workout, yes with THE Cher herself), and mostly I did all the Firm workouts from Volume 1 (my favorite is still Volume 2 with Janet Jones-Gretzky). I also did Tae Bo for awhile, which I really found boring too quickly. For the past few years I have been doing Leslie Sansome's Walk videos and Zumba workouts, both of which I really like.

I found it this video easy to follow, almost predictable which is a good thing for me (I don't need fancy steps after exhausting mental gymnastics at work)but challenging physically. I have great lower body strength though anyway and though I have not been working out for 8 months or so I was still able to do it. There are many plies and lunges but nothing works your legs and butt better than those two exercises, which is why everyone hates to do them but loves the results. I love the intervals and the light weights and well as the pretty moves of some Pilates moves. After just 3 weeks back on it (every other day) my quads and glutes are already shaping back up--actually I could feel the gluteal muscles I so missed coming back in just a week. This is a full-body weight workout if you don't need heavier than three pounds for upper body--which I don't having an hourglass shape. I like that it is done in 30 minutes or so and then when I have time I do a dance or walk video just to burn more calories and then finish with Ellen's floor work which I love also. Yes, Ellen does keep reminding you to tighten your abs which I find works them really well--but then I'm not going for a 6-pack just strength and tone.

I would like to add this. Through all my years of working out I have never lost weight with it, only gotten strong enough to carry around all the excess weight I have piled on since I got married in 1987 and stopped jogging at my husband's behest. You can get strong and fit with any of these workouts but you will not lose weight. It's not about that.",1140220800,4,2257,4.295774647887324

As an alternation for the usual low-intensity Pilates this DVD offers a great change to get your heart rate up and build muscle strength at the same time. There is one major problem with this workout though - IT IS EXTREMELY HARD ON YOUR KNEES. SO DO NOT TRY IT IF YOU HAVE BAD KNEES!!! I have even heard people that usually do not have knee problems to complain about pain in their knees after this program. If you do not have knee problems and you do not get bored to do the same movement over and over again, I warmly recommend this DVD.

First of all, I love all the Crunch videos. I have several, from Boot Camp Training to Candlelight Yoga and they are all very high quality with good instructors. Secondly, Ellen Barrett is just a really good instructor. She is great at giving modifications for those who need them-and I have needed them at times!- and her direction and instructions are very clear. This workout is divided into several parts. The first is a warmup, then you use hand weights(if you choose) for a faster-paced cardio workout, then there is a slower mambo section toward the end. At the very end, though ,  there is about a 10 minute ab section that I find very effective. I highly recommend this workout.",1133481600,,780,4.686131386861314

The instructor is lively and excited, as are the people in the background.  I love seeing multiple people doing the exercises ""correctly"" at different levels.  It helps me adjust my movement/stances at my own pace.

The music was fine---  The instructor stayed up with the rhythm of the music.",1131321600,,539,4.474226804123711

Ellen is so encouraging and keeps reminding you to check your form, but not in an annoying way.  And she makes the movements easy to follow.  The movements looks simple, but if you remember to keep everything tight and controlled, it really is a total body workout.  I would definetly recommend this video to a beginner to Pilates (like me) or to someone more advanced, since her instructions and reminders don't get in the way of the workout.",1130803200,,547,4.43
2053044,5,B00020HCC2,"Ellen Barrett takes instruction to new levels of perfection in Crunch Burn & Firm Pilates. I've rarely seen an instructor not only challenge me to my limits, but also keep me informed as to the next exercise so as to keep me in total harmony.

While doing this workout the first few times, you can modify most of the exercises by not using weights. When you do start using the weights it is invigorating and your heart rate will definitely be elevated to a fat burning zone.

There are quite a few completely unique exercises I have never seen in any workout. The ""swan extension"" is an artistic exercise you accomplish with two weights in hand. You almost feel like you are dancing with weights in some of the segments. Side raises with weights and lots of raising the arms and moving side to side raises the intensity.

Previous experience with Pilates and Ballet will make this workout especially intriguing for intermediate students of both. Ellen Barrett will often alternate between balance and control and then at times require you to balance while controlling the weights and movement of your arms in two different directions. The balance challenges in this workout are exciting and the hand-held weights make you feel much more powerful.

Warm Up
Standing Pilates
Standing Pilates with Weights - 3 segments
Mat Work
Cool Down/Stretch

What will you need?

1 Mat or Towel
Two 3-pound weights

My only question is: ""Why such a short stretching session after such a high intensity workout?"" The place I felt this workout the most was in my lower back and the stretching seemed to mainly focus on the upper body. My knees seemed fine during this workout even with the lunges because Ellen makes sure to remind you to turn out your toes and to check to make sure your knee is not going over your toes.

If you are looking for a perfect warm up, high intensity cardio routine and progressive challenges, I think you will love this routine. The footwork is fairly easy with the coordination level being more challenging for your arms so you get a great arm workout.

I won't stop out of boredom. If you are new to pilates and want something other than floor work...this is the one.,1127001600,3,290,4.105263157894737
2053046,4,B00020HCC2,"this is a great cardio workout that firms your entire body. From the plies, lunges, weights and matwork, your whole body feels toned after the workout. This is great for a mom like me who's press for time. A great total body workout.",1124323200,3,233,4.441860465116279
2053047,5,B00020HCC2,Crunch - Burn & Firm Pilates is a great workout. It is especially good for ex ballet dancers. The workout is fun and includes a great mat sequence and stretches for the back.,1123632000,,174,4.303030303030303
2053048,4,B00020HCC2,"The main complaint I have about this DVD is the repetition! I am used to Ellen's workouts filled with variety and good music. For me, the music was too dull and monotonous. However, this does do an excellent job with both toning and burning fat (I work up a good sweat and it's low impact!) Filled with squat and plie type movements in the first 35 min, and then ends with a good mat segment. Love Ellen, but wish this DVD kept my interest more. It feels like it lasts forever, and it's just about 45min.",1121817600,2,504,4.260416666666667
2053049,5,B00020HCC2,"Get this DVD and stick with it and you will see results!  You could get on that stairmaster or treadmill but you wouldn't be toning your entire body (which is key).  I have been fitness conscious and physically active since my early 20s.  My experience as an aerobic/step instructor from my 20s into my 30s had given me a good base of fitness knowledge.  Now approaching 43 and having faced surgery induced menopause I have found it more difficult to stay fit, loose weight and get toned.  Always tired due to severe sleep deprivation related to (night sweats), I fell into the pit of believing that  hour a day on my treadmill or stairmaster (4 or 5 days a week) would be enough and it just wasn't.  What I found is that I began to have sagging upper arms and a larger middle section.  One day running with (very fit/ripped and trim) sister-in-law (same age as myself) I discovered that she prefers Pilates over any other workout.  An instructor herself she now only teaches or takes Pilates.

I have read many of the reviews written by other people that claim this DVD doesn't make you sweat enough.  To that I say work harder.  This video is good but you need to put in the effort and trust me you will sweat and elevate your heart rate.  If you feel like you are not sweating enough add in the arm movements earlier (once you get to know the video), use heavier weights or step fuller/wider.  Or you could mix it up with treadmill/stairmaster or bike by alternating days.  Mix it up anyway, so you don't get board.

As for me I have been using this video and others along with some biking and my treadmill.  When I choose biking/treadmill/stairmaster over the DVDs, I always include the Ab portion of one of the DVDs.  I feel good, I am sleeping better (night sweats - lessening), I AM losing weight and people are noticing.  I hope I have inspired you.  Good luck and get to it.",1118102400,29,1883,4.434402332361516
2053050,5,B00020HCC2,"This workout is fun.  I used this dvd three times a week, with a healthy eating plan to lose my last stubborn 10 pounds. Ellen is very encouraging and gives helpful cues.  Ellen integrates weights in this dvd.  She recommends using a set of 2 to 3 pound weights.  This helps tone and define your arms at a faster rate.  Remember you don't want to use a heavy set of weights (like five to eight pounds) because you will get big bulky muscles.  The majority of this workout is cardio and the other part of this workout is traditional mat work.  The cardio segment is not intense, but if you are out of shape you may want to start off without the weights.  As you progress use the weights for a more challenging workout.  I love this dvd an recommend for a cardio and pilates workout.",1116979200,11,781,4.294520547945205
2053051,5,B00020HCC2,"I just got this DVD on Saturday and used it last night for the first time.  I woke up this morning and my thighs and my obliques are really sore.  I love that feeling!  I will also say that I workout about 3-4 times a week and I have been using Ellen's Fat Burning Pilates for about 4 months (also a good buy) and I so I wanted to see what else she had available.  Well this DVD kicked my butt.  I had to stop halfway through because I had so much sweat running down my face, it was getting my eyes.  Loved it though.  I love that burning feeling and the sore feeling the next day.  Makes you feel like you did something!",1116892800,5,621,3.9516129032258065
2053052,4,B00020HCC2,"I like this DVD for it's unique combination of cardio, pilates and strength training. It is also easy to follow and Ellen is a good instructor. You definitely get a good solid workout from this DVD, however it is important to note that this is not true pilates.  Many of the moves such as the see-saw and the swan moves are pilates-inspired, but many other moves are old-fashion aerobics, such as the mambo and step touch.  Ellen also works in other classic strength training moves such as plie-squats and lunges.  Your arms are constantly in motion with weights in hands, so it is also a decent arm workout.  At the very end is a short segment of true mat pilates that works your abs.  It all flows nicely together.  My only complaint is there are too many people in the background which makes the set seem cluttered and messy. But other than that small complaint, I love this workout.",1116288000,2,886,4.540880503144654
2053053,5,B00020HCC2,"I loved this workout! Challenging, but fun. With all the pilates and weights, the workout really does leave you sweating. However, the best part of this workout is Ellen Barret herself. She is just so wonderful! I loved this workout because of her! If you like pilates, you will love this workout. If  you are new to pilates, you will love this work out. Thank you Ellen!!",1115942400,2,372,4.552238805970149
2053054,5,B00020HCC2,"I don't usually write reviews, but this one got me to do one.  I'm new to Crunch exercise videos/dvds and Ellen Barrett. The combination is great.  Very effective indeed! I go to pilates classes and I must say this dvd lives up to the pilates discipline. I never understand why some people write, ""I can't wait to do the exercise again"", now I know why.  I also have Ellen Barrett's pilates dvd and it's just as good.",1113523200,2,417,4.3896103896103895
2053055,5,B00020HCC2,"This video has me dripping at the end.  It is great for the lower body and since weights are incorporated, your arms will tone well too.  I have lost 25 pounds by watching what I have been eating and by alternating my exercise videos.  This is my favorite.  Ellen's instructing is great.  I have also enjoyed Karen Voigt's Burn and Firm which is circuit training.",1113004800,,363,4.523076923076923
2053056,3,B00020HCC2,"I bought this dvd for something to do over spring break. I thought it would be a lot on abs(which i need work on)because i heard pilates focused alot on your abs. The problem I had with it didn't go anywhere. There are no other levels! The first time i did it i could barly do the arm and cardio stuff, but after two weeks i was bored with it. One this it does do is gives you a sweat. Over all i thought it was i wish it got harder but it didn't.",1112745600,2,447,3.765957446808511
2053057,5,B00020HCC2,"I bought this video because I loved Ellen's Fat Burning Pilates video.  I thought that I had mastered the video so I figured it was time to upgrade and boy I was no wear near ready for this video.  I workout 6 days a week and it takes a lot for me to get sore and tired during any workout, but this one (I admit) kicked my butt.  I was definetly feeling the burn in this one.  There are a lot of lunges and piles in this video.  I was very impressed with this video.  It takes a lot to get me tired and hurting and in this video it did just that.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking for a great challenging workout.  Just make sure your ready for all the lunges and piles.  I would not recommend this video to anyone who has mild to serious knee problems.",1112054400,13,781,3.9870967741935486
2053058,5,B00020HCC2,"I don't attend a gym, so I rely a lot on workout DVDs.  This DVD seems to be one of the only ones I keep coming back too.  The instructor is phenomenal.  She explains the movements well and has a soft, friendly, encouraging tone.  The workout definitely raises my heart rate and keeps me sweating until the final Pilates matwork segment, which is short but thorough.  The DVD is effective because the cardio portion focuses on legs and arms, while the matwork is great for abs.  Afterwards, I feel like I have had an effective workout for my whole body.  This program is great for beginners, and if you're more advanced, use heavier weights and you will definitely feel a difference.  The DVD does contain a lot of lunges and plies, so this may not be great for those with bad knees.  Also, if you're looking for a more traditional Pilates matwork routine, this may not be what you're looking for either, as this DVD is more dance-inspired. All in all, a great blend of cardio and Pilates.  I definitely recommend this!",1111881600,3,1019,4.549450549450549
2053063,1,B00020HCC2,"I used this dvd once and will probably never use it again. It had a lot of lunge work, almost through the whole video. There was hardly any ab work, which is why I bought this dvd in the first place. It used weights, which was great but you repeated the same 4 steps through a song and then again 4 new steps through the song. It focused a lot on balancing and not a lot on pilates.",1111104000,12,382,3.91025641025641
2053064,5,B00020HCC2,"This is one of my absolute favorite workouts!  It's a great Pilates workout, and the use of the weights really ups your heart rate and makes for a great calorie/fat burner.  The next day I can feel the workout in all of my muscles.  It's also a great energizing tape, unlike some of the other pilates and yoga workouts I do, which tend to make me more tired. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, even a beginner.",1110326400,,420,4.358974358974359
2053065,4,B00020HCC2,"After a LONG exercise hiatus I'm now trying to get myself back on the wagon.  I've been reading reviews on Amazon as to various workout DVDS I might enjoy.  I've heard a lot about Pilates and thought it might be something I'd enjoy to tone my body.  At the same time I was looking for something which would help as far as cardio and therefore burn calories & fat.

I used this DVD for the first time last night and it was perfect.  It's great for beginners as nothing is too complicated and everything is well explained.  The instructor is very soothing and motivating.  She's great at cueing what is coming next.  The few moves that were not first explained were easy enough to pickup on immediately.

The first 30-minutes of the DVD is a cardio workout for which you'll need to wear sneakers and keep a set of 2-3lb weights handy.  The weights are optional at all times and there is one `student' who shows you the toned down moves without.  I haven't worked out in years and no problem with the 2lb weights throughout.  The next 10-minues are some on the mat Pilates where you get to kick off your shoes and relax a bit more.

The only reason I did not give this DVD a full 5-stars is that I think it could have actually been a bit more challenging.  The cardio portion was adequate, but I thought the on the floor Pilates portion could have been a bit longer.  Also, the fact that I managed so well my first time leads me to believe it will definitely be a beginner workout.  However, I think as you become more experienced with the moves you'll being doing them more properly and may feel the burn even more.

I never got overly tired, and just when I thought I might poop out during the cardio out she said we were `almost done' and I hung in there.  I'm only slightly sore today, just the right amount of burn.

I do recommend for beginners!",1110326400,,1848,4.319767441860465
2053066,4,B00020HCC2,"I have several of Ellen Barrett's workouts. She is a GREAT instructor. She is easy to follow. The pilates with the weights makes this an interesting and fun workout. A must have if you enjoy working out. There are alot of lunges and piles, if you have bad knees you may want to reconsider getting this workout. Overall I found the workout to be a decent workout for your whole body.",1109721600,,382,4.394366197183099
2053067,5,B00020HCC2,"Having gone through Pilates, Yoga, Jazzercise and several Austin DVD's, I would like to stress that this workout is a Blast and a Crunch.  Ellen's timing and call outs are great!  She has the gift of superb leadership.

The workout as described by other reviews is as good as it gets.  Supplementing my regular routine with a good burn and a new slant on Pilates (which tweeks my back).  Not too much strain while emphasising the basics in the stand up position.  I feel the burn, I see results.  It's good, it's compact, it's great movement and NOT TOO arduous...but with results.  I feel invigorated after the series.

My workout time has been enhanced by this release.

Thanks!

2053068,4,B00020HCC2,"I work out for 45 min a day at the gym at work (cardio and weights) I bought this video because I was looking for something to do on the weekends.

I tried it for the first time last weekend. The instructor in the beginning said to use no more than 3lb weights. I thought ""Bah! I work out every day! I don't even LOOK at the 3lb weights!  Three pounds are for wussies!"" SO I grabbed my 8 lb weights. . . the next day I went to Wal-mart and bought myself some 3 lb weights.

I enjoyed this DVD very much. I find it very good for a light day on the weekend.  There are some pilates moves, but lots of lunges and squats. I was feeling it in my quads by the end of the video which is a good thing! While my heart was pumping and I did break a small sweat, I do not believe the rate was up in the ""fat burning zone"" as the instructor kept saying.

I would definitely recommend this DVD to someone who is looking for a light, effective workout on their ""off days"".  And I think that if done a few times a week, you will definitely see results with this work out.",1107129600,4,1056,3.911214953271028
2053069,3,B00020HCC2,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this is a good workout - or it would be if I could do it all.  I have an injured knee and so I generally do pilates because it doesn't require a lot of things that I can't do or that causes pain in my knee.  So, I was a little disappointed that the first 30 minutes of the work-out involved a LOT of plies and lunges.  Once my knee heals I know I will enjoy this workout, but right now it was not what I was looking for.  If you're used to a mat-based Pilates work-out this is VERY different.  It focuses more on holding your core and breathing through various light aerobic, dance and arm movements.  If, like me, you have a knee problem, this might not be a good choice for you.

I came back to revise this review, now that my knee has healed and I can fully do the workout.  I enjoy it very much.  It's tough and you'll definitely work up a sweat.  It doesn't seem like it, but you get a phenomenal workout of your core while holding it steady throughout the workout.  Plus, you get the toning workout of all the plies and lunges, as well as light hand weights.  Definitely recommend, although I still note that it is not like a ""typical"" pilates mat-based workout.",1106352000,5,1214,4.163090128755365
2053070,5,B00020HCC2,"This DVD will make you feel the burn! You definitely do not need more than three pound weights to complete this DVD. If you do, you will regret it. I found this DVD to be surprisingly challenging after many years of total fitness training. I have found a new obsession beyond the gym and the classroom when it comes to healthy living. I love Pilates and the strength it provides. This DVD takes usual Pilates moves and joins complete strength training with hand-held weights. It is a total arm workout, and I love it. If you are not a morning person, like me, it is a bit challenging  to complete in the morning before work. I would recommend this DVD to be completed in the evening when you have more energy and are more alert. I have one other Crunch DVD and I love them both. I have a feeling over the next few months I will order more. It is nice to switch up my regular workout routine in order to avoid boredom. Another thing that is great about this DVD is the participants in the class. They are not all cookie cutter perfect bodies like the other DVD's I have tried. Each individual in the class represents all body sizes and shapes. It is even more motivational seeing people just like me working out. As always, the instructor Ellen is great- highly motivational and clear in her instructions.",1106265600,2,1304,4.433333333333334

2053073,4,B00020HCC2,"I just tried this tape for the first time after using two other Crunch cardio videos.  This tape kicked my [...]!!  I thought this tape would be all ""zen"" with focus on stretching and toning, and breathing etc.  Wrong!!  Now... I haven't worked out in about 4 months, and let me tell you.. if you like open squats, lunges, squats again, and then even more squats with weights, you'll love this tape!  As a newbie, I could barely walk the next day (I went through the whole tape with 3lb. weights, I thought how hard could it be...?  Ouch!!). The pace is quick and you will work up a sweat.  If you like lots of squats and legwork, this is the tape for you! (I don't recommend using weights at first if you are a newbie to working out though).

I didn't feel a thing in my arms though when she did the arm sequence.  The stomach section was good and effective, but not long enough.

You don't really learn much about Pilates other than a few terms she uses for the moves you're doing. But for me, the excellent workout is what mattered.

This tape hurts, but it will become my favorite!!

I really enjoyed the instructor, she seemed natural and positive.",1104364800,2,1153,4.36150234741784
2053074,4,B00020HCC2,"I am an intermediate exerciser who has recently lost 25 pounds.  Some of that weight came off with the help of Ellen Barrett and Crunch Burn and Firm Pilates.  This video has become my favorite!  The moves are fun and challenging without being too complicated.  It's rare to find a cardio video that doesn't require 20 years of ballet lessons to get through the first five minutes.  I really appreciate Ellen's clear, straightforward instructions.  The workout is fantastic!  It requires effort, but won't leave you gasping for air or feeling drained.  This video is probably not for hard-core athletes, but for the rest of us ""normal people"" it's great!",1103155200,4,654,4.935779816513762

It's a total 45 minute workout, and it works mostly the arms and the legs.  The abs are good too but very little time is spent on the abs although you're supposed to holding in the abs through out the whole workout.  I really enjoyed it and along with my other crunch bootcamp and Tamilee Webbs Weight Loss video, my body feels like it gets a great workout.",1102636800,3,521,4.319587628865979
2053076,5,B00020HCC2,"Disclaimer: If you've never done a Crunch Workout before, this may not be a good jumping off point for you.  There is a lot of use of hand weights that if you are not used to, can be difficult on a first try.

Crunch Workouts are excellent.  In fact, I now do them exclusively after previewing many different videos and DVDs.  But I would highly recommend starting with Crunch's Fat Burning Pilates before attemping Burn & Firm if the aforementioned concerns you.  Endurance, nay, HIGH endurance is KEY.

Having said that, this video is slowly becoming my one and only.  It really does produce fast results though I alternate on using the hand weights.  Using weights everyday is a bit taxing, I keep it to three times a week.

Burn & Firm is the most cardio you will find in a pilates workout video.  And I cannot stress that enough.  It is definitely ""burn"" as opposed to Fat Burning Pilates where the moves are more dance-y and light.  You will not believe how much you will sweat.

Ellen Barrett is an amazing instructor.  Very friendly, motivating and personable.  All around great pick!",1101945600,4,1092,4.614583333333333
2053077,5,B00020HCC2,"I've recently given 5 stars to another fitness video on Amazon and seriously thought it would be quite a while before I find another one I just can't seem to complain about. But Burn & Firm Pilates has definitely swept me off of my feet.

When I first saw Ellen I gotta admit I didn't like her at all. I just thought she didn't look like someone I would wanna look like after doing this tape. It took me a few times of doing the workout to actually grow and like her - but I really have. I realized she was cute and natural, which qualities so many other instructors lack. I still don't feel like she's giving it her all - then again, I understand she needs to stay relaxed enough to actually be able to talk. Because running out of breath IS what you should expect when you are doing the fat burning routine with ALL your might. There's one lady in the background that does slightly easier versions of the exercises, but if you don't feel challenged enough, you can easily find ways of breaking into even more sweat. Like, I use heavier dumbbells (by the way, a couple of dumbbells and a mat or carpet is all the equipment you'll need, no fancy steps or such), when it comes to the mambo section, I do the lounges from the very beginning and I do ""Shave the head"" with both dumbbells. The cardio section is a little over 20 minutes long and I keep sweating like crazy even though I weigh less than 100 pounds.

The mat workout could be longer - it's less than 10 minutes. The exercises seem effective enough, but I always feel like I could go on, so I usually just do one of those time-saving 10 to 15 minute sculpting workouts right after the mat section on this tape.

I usually care a great deal about background people on tapes and I couldn't say one bad thing about the ones on this one. They differ in age, built and color and they basically just look like those people at Ellen's daily classes must look like.

One more thing for those new to Pilates: this was my first Pilates tape and as far as I can tell from what I'd previously and have since learned, the exercises on Burn & Firm might be Pilates-BASED, but they don't excatly have a lot to do with what you see in books. However, it IS a great workout routine and you will definitely feel the change in your body if you stick with it.",1100131200,8,2299,4.242009132420091

I used muscles in my legs I didn't know existed.  Keep in mind though, this workout is BASED on pilates moves.  The first part, the cardio session, really gets your heart pumping and is all done standing up using pilates inspired moves like plies and squats.  (If you have bad knees think twice about this.)  The last 10 mins was the mat work, which I felt was a little short but was a nice cool down.  An incrdible workout in 45 mins!",1098662400,5,578,4.017543859649122

The participants on the DVD are not all ""hard bodies"" - they are ""everyday"" women which for me, is easier to watch.  The music is uplifting, fast moving - and Ellen is easy to understand and follow.

I like the addition of hand-weights.  This is a new spin on pilates.  My arms and legs really felt the burn.  If you do not like squats or if you enjoy a slower, calmer pilates style - this may not be your favorite...however, it is definitely one of my favorites because I keep a great pace and I can feel the muscles stretch and move without having a high-impact workout.

The mat work was shorter than her other DVD's, however, I substitute a segment from her ""Pick Your Spot Pilates"" DVD if I feel I want to continue mat work.

Ellen is definitely my favorite instructor.  I look forward to any more pilates DVD's she releases in the future.

I have a bunch of workout dvds and I use youtube as well, but I keep coming back to Ellens dvds because I enjoy them and her encouraging spirit.",1495929600,2,292,4.327272727272727

8019620,5,B00020HCC2,"I have had this particular DVD for over 10 years now.  It was my first attempt at Pilates and regular exercise.  I am now a long distance runner, a P90X veteran, and an Ellen Barrett junkie.  This is by far my favorite of the many videos I have of hers.  Even with all the other exercise I do, I still feel like I get a good workout with this video....granted, it's my light day go to....but I still feel like I've worked up a sweat and worked out every part of my body.  There are lots of plies, lunges, and kicks....but ladies, your leg muscles are the biggest in your body - you gotta work them to burn calories.  Using three pound weights doesn't feel like an incredible challenge and I feel my arms get a better workout with her Slim Sculpt video, but this one, I feel, is better at working everything and still leaving you feeling invigorated and strengthened.",1488412800,11,866,4.3478260869565215

8019622,5,B00020HCC2,"So, I bought this DVD in 2016 and it first came out in 2004.  Sometimes I've been concerned that older DVDs may have routines that are dated or boring.  Not so with this one.  I have a huge collection of workout DVDs and usually shy away from Pilates because it seems slow moving and dull.  But Ellen Barrett is an excellent teacher and this Pilates workout includes cardio and weights and I love the combination. The time flew by when with this workout.  A great choice.",1480118400,7,471,4.430232558139535
