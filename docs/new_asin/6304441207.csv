Maybe a good show for the inexperienced....",1314230400,,137,4.52
7871299,2,6304441207,"All I can say is, ""I wasted my money!"" This is not the best of the Real Sex Series. I don't even have HBO and I can think of better ones I saw at friends houses who have cable. It has a few funny parts, but I'm very dissapointed in what they chose to put on this compilation. What happened to the couple who screwed the Real Doll? Remember that crap? Now that was a classic!!!!!",1082851200,8,378,3.986842105263158
7871300,5,6304441207,"First off, if anyone has seen HBO's Real Sex shows, you'll know that this is The Best of Real Sex. Picking the most interesting segments on the show...and not just a man and a woman getting down and dirty. I've seen basically all of the Real Sex shows from the begining, and the topics or ""documentaries"" they show are meant to enlighten and open the minds of those who have them closed. You'll find anything in the shows, from the yearly Exotic-Erotic Ball, to a NYC Wall St Exec. submitting to a Mistress by being humiliated in a private Dungeon somewhere in Manhattan. So to those who are expecting some actual, ""sensual"" real sex-ish porno, this is NOT the video for you...but if you're interested in something like the Miss Nude competition, then buy it :) You might like it... ta ta",1027641600,19,788,4.556338028169014
