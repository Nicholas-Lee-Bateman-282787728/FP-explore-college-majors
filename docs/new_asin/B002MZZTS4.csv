8374530,3,B002MZZTS4,"The makeup wasn't very convincing for the wolf woman, who is in just one scene. Mostly it's about a woman who acts wolfish towards her victims. The woman-as-other theme is a very old, and persistent one. Attractive actresses in the cast.",1473033600,,237,4.804878048780488
8374531,4,B002MZZTS4,"LEGEND OF THE WOLF WOMAN (aka: WEREWOLF WOMAN) stars Annik Borel as Daniela, a woman haunted by visions of her -thankfully young- great-grandmother dancing naked, and turning into a werewolf. After going on a murderous rampage, Daniela ends up in a mental hospital, where she escapes her restraints, and returns to her bloody hi-jinx. Several gross, awful men attack her, driving her deeper into insanity, and further fueling her violent vendetta. This culminates in the glorious ""junkyard revenge""  scene. LOTWW has far more in common w/ I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, or other, similar revenge movies, than it does w/ any true werewolf / monster movie. Ms. Borel is terrrrific in her absolutely-bonkers role. Not for the squeamish, or the easily offended...",1454112000,3,750,5.147540983606557

8374534,5,B002MZZTS4,"My rating may be a little biased based on my love for these types of horror movies.  The average viewer would probably turn this off after 5 minutes but as I said, I'm a big fan of cheesy 70's horror films from other countries.",1417824000,,227,4.159090909090909

8374536,4,B002MZZTS4,"The DVD called WEREWOLF WOMAN has the top, bottom and both sides cropped. This copy is missing picture from the top and bottom. The VHS is the only way to see the entire image. I bought a VHS from Amazon, but it turned out to be a bootleg with an image so watery and dark, it was basically unwatchable. I purchased NIGHTMARE WORLDS just to get a copy of this film on DVD. The format is the same as Sinister's, with image missing from the top and bottom, but it is so dark, it is really not that easy to watch. So as far as a DVD version of this film, this is the best I've found, so far. What image remains on the WEREWOLF WOMAN DVD is sharper than this, but it's a different, European cut, which is longer, but not as entertaining as the shorter, American cut. Hopefully, someday, I'll latch onto a first-generation VHS copy, but for now, this is the version I'll watch. If you haven't seen this film, you should! It's a stupid, ridiculous, funny, weird and sleazy good time. Now the bad news: when I first got this I was very disappointed, because it would slow down, then speed up, in short intervals, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE FILM. As much as I love this film, I couldn't sit through this irritating visual anomaly. I went to Sinister's website and found out that their DVD-R's play fine on some players, but not on others. I popped the disc into a cheaper DVD player, and on that one this baby looks better and plays fine! It's still missing the top and bottom of the image, but this is the DVD version to get. So, if you order discs from Sinister, don't despair if the disc has problems...just have another player on hand, and you're good to go!",1276646400,8,1648,4.319354838709677
