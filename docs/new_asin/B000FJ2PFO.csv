8156253,4,B000FJ2PFO,"""Bobby Ware is Missing"" made in 1955 is a movie that could be called
rather unusual, at least by to-day's standards, because it has obviously
been made for adult viewing when first released but to-day its contents
would  be accepted for general viewing by the entire family.

The story told is the simple drama of  a Police search for two missing
young boys who fail to return home one aftermoon, not because of
foul play but because of their own silly actions.

The story is non-violent and centres around the two youngsters who
visit a mining quarry knowing full well that they should not be there,
so they cover up their bikes and tracks so that no one will know.

Disaster strikes and no one knows where they are. The Police search
but find nothing. The.parents are frustrated and think the worst that
they have been kidnapped and are being held for ransom.  To make
things worse, enters a would be blackmailer who was not involved in
the boy's disappearance but knows the family involved and that they
have money, so he attempts extortion and sends them a ransome note
demanding money.

The movie is good, solid and sensible entertainment which is seldom
seen these days and is loaded with action and suspernse, sufficient to
hold your attention from beginning to end. It is also a real life story
that could happen to anyone.

The cast inclides:
Neville Brand as Police Lt. Andy Flynn
Arthur Franz and Jean Willes as the parents
Child actor Kim Charney as Bobby Ware

The entire cast including the two boys act their parts well and
make the story believable.

It is a shame that movies such as this are buried in the vaults of
time and are seldom if ever seen by the public.",1406764800,2,1680,4.57
