8190214,5,B000PBZFCM,"I was shocked to read a review about how ""violent"" these animated stories are (the Living Scriptures series). Not at all. They are family cartoons and have a great spirit about them. They end on a positive note and are true to the scriptures. My children have watched them over and over and have learned wonderful lessons from the scriptures. Many of my friends' children also watch these animated stories and love them. They are uplifting and contain beautiful, touching songs which bring a warm feeling into our home.
There is far more violence in your average TV cartoon than in these scripture stories.",1307318400,,606,4.836538461538462
8190215,2,B000PBZFCM,All these vidoes are too violent.  None of them end on a positive note.  They all go way too far and  focus on the violence.  My kids don't even want to watch them because of all the violence.,1272585600,,192,3.973684210526316
