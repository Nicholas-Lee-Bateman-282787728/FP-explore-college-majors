3777055,5,B001RLW9ZK,I had the opportunity to see WOFD at an advance screening and thought it was a very well-made film. Thora Birch delivers a terrific performance and I always enjoy Keith Carradine's acting. It's more than a little frightening to remember that this is based on a true story.,1240531200,4,272,4.6875
3777056,2,B001RLW9ZK,"The trailer for this film is on IMDB.
The film was shot nearby my home in Schenectady NY.
There was no budget for this, they asked extras to bring their own original 70's clothes and hired people who had them.
It by-passed theaters and is going straight to DVD and the Lifetime movie network...
The shoddy work seen in the trailer makes it look like it was actually shot on Super 8 film in the 70's..",1238371200,,400,4.276315789473684

3777059,2,B001RLW9ZK,"I saw this when it ran on Lifetime, and found it dreary and disappointing. Then I read the book, which is gripping, entertaining, and totally captures the Madison area of the 1970's in a fascinating way. Barbara Hoffman's crimes and trial were massive news back in the day - my father talked for years about passing her and her attorney as they walked downtown, and how she just gave off a riveting vibe. Since I enjoyed the book so much, I decided to give the film one more viewing to see if it was really as awful as I recalled.

Long story short: It was.

While Thora Birch does her best to embody Ms Hoffman, she's hamstrung by the slow-moving script and cliched dialogue. Her costars (aside from a feisty Keith Carradine) are given nothing much to do.

Most disappointing, however, was the decision to set this in Generic Smalltown USA. Companion and I snorted every time we saw the ""Village Police Station"", and rolled our eyes when the detective drove miles out in the country to the pimp's house - instead of the actual ritzy community of Maple Bluff (inside Madison's city limits, btw, not out in the sticks.)

Maybe it's being from where the story took place that makes it so thoroughly disappointing. Well, that, and the painfully dull script.

It was good for a giggle, but not for a movie of a really gripping crime story. Someone should take the source material and make a GOOD movie out of it.",1356480000,2,1408,4.549407114624506
3777060,2,B001RLW9ZK,"Movie was O.K.
I knew Barbara.
She was beautiful, smart, and came from a wonderful family.
Read the book.
It was better",1301529600,,119,4.454545454545454
3777061,4,B001RLW9ZK,"Winter Of Frozen Dreams gives an interesting glimpse into the life of Barbara Hoffman, an attractive young woman living through serious drama.  Working with the wrong people leads to troubled, difficult life which spirals out of control.

Thora portrays Barbara Hoffman as a strong person who remains dignified under humiliating circumstances.  You cannot help but side with her character because of this.

This is a memorable movie for it's stirring and intense storyline.  You will be drawn into the life of an intelligent and melancholy character, peaking your interest throughout.",1285027200,,584,5.444444444444445

*Good cinematography
*Thora Birch's performance

*Dean Winters' slimy pimp
CONS:

SUMMARY:  Average biopic with little suspense or thrills buoyed by Birch's portrayal",1279756800,,273,6.583333333333333

3777064,3,B001RLW9ZK,"I love Thora Birch (DARK CORNERS, THE HOLE). However, her talents are mostly wasted in WINTER OF FROZEN DREAMS. It starts out fine, w/ a murder and the ensuing cover-up. Unfortunately, things bog down in a big way, leaving Thora w/ little to do as the (rather bizarre) Barbara Hoffman. Keith Carradine's cop-near-retirement character isn't all that exciting, but then no one in this movie is very dynamic! I actually drifted into dreamland a few times, something I NEVER do when Ms. Birch is on screen! Alas, I re-watched it and found that I hadn't missed a thing...  P.S.- Don't even get me started on the mega-whimp played by Brendan Sexton III! His character was so spineless I could barely watch him! Ugh...",1263513600,,711,4.780487804878049
3777065,1,B001RLW9ZK,"The acting in this movie was good. Keith Carradine and Thora Birch are experienced actors and did an admirable job despite a deplorable screenplay. I was in Madison when the ""drama"" for this play was unfolding. I have read the book. There is so much that could have been done with this story, but the movie never focuses on anything. It is like a movie version of Cliff's Notes."" It ""covers the bases,"" but never gets into the character's heads much, especially Birch's character, Barbara Hoffman. That is where the interest of this story lies. But again, all we see is a flat portrayl of a complex character. Again, the fault is in the screenplay and directing, not the acting.",1243555200,7,678,4.658333333333333
3777066,3,B001RLW9ZK,"Before anyone gets too upset, yes I do understand the issues and trials it takes to make an independent film, especially on such a sad topic as a black widow killer. But this was a mess. One more quick thing, I notice people keep talking about her as a serial killer, but I though that took three murders, but anyway.

Barbara Hoffman gets played decently by Thora Birch and Keith Carradine comes in to save the film (and the day) as the lead detective that helped bring this case to a close. Realizing this takes place in the 1970s, I wish they would have at least removed the 2000-era commercial truck, removed the 1990s props, or at least told the dead bodies to stop breathing for one take (I kept yelling at the screen saying he isn't dead...run!)

The misplaced editing style of time jumping was poorly done, the sound was a train wreck, and my favorite actor of the film in Dean Winters had a minor role. But the cavalry was Mr. Carradine, and he is a joy to watch. If you skip the entire movie and just watch the special features interview with him, you will have not wasted a cent. The other features are mediocre, including a shorter behind the scenes, a ""Behind the Headlines"" snippet and an ""About the Author"" that both would make for a good intro to an American Justice episode, but little else.

I felt disappointed when it was over, and so much more could have been done, but there were constraints and limits.",1241395200,12,1425,4.452107279693487

8338224,3,B001RLW9ZK,"I saw nothing in this film resembling prostitution.  Lots of indications of criminal thuggery common to the homosexual religionists and their corrupt
divorce racketeering goofermint offals.  Lots of yammering as if anything hetero without felonious enslavement in the ""marriage"" and divorce racketeering swindle systems must be ""prostitution"".  Aspects of the film reminded me of the inflation adjusted $3 million of ""insurance"" in favor of a statutory rapist divorce racketeer placed on my life when I was 17 years of age.  Hence no quality of production could elevate this film above three stars.",1468800000,,598,5.467391304347826

8338228,4,B001RLW9ZK,Mostly true story.  I lived in WI during this time.  I did enjoy reading the original script more... Less confusing as to time of action that was taking place.  (My son was one of the script writers),1393977600,,199,4.324324324324325
