262445,5,6300227049,"As a KISS fan, I highly recommend this.  I would say that most KISS fans have seen this and know what I am talking about.  Great interviews and videos, especially the Paul Stanley workout..too funny.  For those who have not seen it..get it, you will not be dissatisfied.",1014940800,4,270,4.583333333333333
262446,4,6300227049,"Asylum is an excellent collection. Kiss just keeps getting better as time goes by, and this collection shows their great 1980's songs. The 1970's concert footage is awsome too. Although the interview with Kiss is ""staged"", they tell you the facts about the band and the way they feel about it. Paul and Gene's comical interludes are cool. I think the video could use a bit more of Eric and Bruce, but all in all, definately worth having.",1009584000,,437,4.615384615384615
262447,1,6300227049,"Where do I start?
Low points:
1. Make-believe interviews (c'mon guys, real ones are infinitely more interesting).
2. Gene and Paul acting like sex-crazed eighth graders.
3. Gene and Paul slamming Ace and Peter (especially Ace).
4. Gene and Paul acting like buffoons (especially Paul).
High points:
1. A few minutes of excellent, early concert footage from around 1973 or so.
2. Oh, well of course the girls are nice to look at.
Conclusion:
This video is awful and it was filmed during a time when Kiss was releasing some of the worst music ever.  During this period they sounded as if they were trying to compete with Loverboy, or maybe Night Ranger.  Don't buy it for the scantily clad young ladies prancing around. There are plenty of videos on that subject and you don't have to sit through Gene and Paul's ego trip.",1007942400,5,819,4.680555555555555
262448,4,6300227049,"I've seen it, and I like it.  The tunes are great, and this sort of thing was what every kid who picked up a guitar in the 80s dreamed of (fame, money, girls...okay, mostly girls, and lots of them.)  My only real problem  stems from one thing:  Why weren't Eric and Bruce allowed to have a little  more camera time?  I think they were in the thing for a grand total of 3  minutes.  the other 80+ seemed to be devoted to Gene & Paul being  silly.  Good shot, but not quite a bull's-eye.",964569600,3,485,4.0638297872340425
262449,4,6300227049,"I thought KISS Exposed was a an excellent video.  I watch it at least once a week and always get a kick out of Gene and Paul's antics.  It is full of humour right from the start and has great concert footage as well as videos  such as Lick it Up,  I love it Loud, Heaven's on Fire etc.  It featured  interviews with the founding members of KISS, Gene Simmons and Paul  Stanley.  A must have for any true KISS fanatic",954633600,12,416,4.049382716049383
262450,5,6300227049,"This video was shot during KISS's 'Hey what the hell's up with us?' years. THE ONLY reason to buy this video is for the old concert footage with all four original members. The rest of the tape leaves more questions than  answers. Gene and Paul hog the camera for the entire shooting while Bruce  and Eric are shown three seconds apiece. Bruce is chasing a girl, and Eric  is being chased by a girl. This is the most they have to contribute. I  would have been interested in hearing what Eric first thought when he  joined the group (as you all know his first effort with KISS was the  Elder). Also I didn't appreciate the cheap shots Paul and Gene gave Ace and  Peter. Vinnie Vincient who basically wrote the album 'Lick it Up' and saved  KISS gets no credit for anything. (Although you see a glimpse of him in the  Brazil Love it Loud Video.) This video mainly portrays what Gene and Paul  realy are, egomaniacs whose heads can barely fit in that mansion. But if  you can get past their B.S. and enjoy the music, I'd recommend it. That's  why we have the little FF button on the remote. And the questions that are  left unanswered?  Here they are.....
1. Even though he's surrounded by  babes throughout the video, I still wonder if he's gay or if his  personallity is just naturally acting like a flamer.
2. Gene is merely a  shadow of his former demon days, with his Salvador Dali outfits and Dolly  Parton wig. He's so gone 'Hollywood' that you wonder if he could name more  than a song or two off Animalize, Asylum, or Crazy Nights.
3. Does that  butler have more balls than Gene and Paul put together?
4. How often does  Paul share his bed with Sonny Crockett? (his very Michael Jackson like  monkey)
5. Has Paul ever read a book in his life? Joseph Kiss senior (who  envisioned KISS in 1645) was actually a portrait of Sir Walter Haig.",952992000,5,1842,4.400593471810089
262558,5,6300227049,"My husband had been looking to replace his VHS tape of the Kiss Exposed for many years. This past Halloween, he brought out the tape to copy one of the guys face paint for him to dress up for Halloween. The tape was so old and skipping.... I was so happy to see you had one for Sales.

262559,4,6300227049,"I got this video when was release on VHS. I love it because I'm a big fan of Kiss but I can understand why more serious Kiss fan can't enjoy it. is full of foolish scenes that are filled with hot chicks. but hey, they are the freaking Kiss band, Paul Stanley was been a clown since I have memory, but a clown in a good way, he makes me laugh and feel envy. he makes childish stuffs because its part of his character's charming.

Gene of course that will make all the dark things that show in the video. it's part of his character and people surely will not understand that Kiss since the beginning is about that, play the fantasy, or better say WELCOME TO THE SHOW. anyone that will not be an Amish or an hypocrite christian fundamentalist can tell me that don't wanna be anyone of them at least for one day?.  XD

the bad thing in the video is the lack of participation of Bruce and Eric and since he pass out, this is remarkably bad. I could bet that Paul and Gene regret that.

but stills is a great video. I'll not giving 5 stars because is a VHS copy in DVD format. even as the video was a little bit retouched in his colors, I could kill for see and hear lick it up, heavens on fire and the others in 5.1, and of course they have more space so, any extra material could be awesome. but in general, is a classic and a collection must have.",1324771200,,1344,4.079545454545454

262564,5,6300227049,"Some of the reviewers here don't understand this DVD,

It starts off saying it's a Docu-Drama and that says it right.  It pretends to be a interview of two outragious guy's living in a strange place.

The interviews are comedy sketches and pretty funny.
The Paul Stanley mansion is sorta like the Playboy mansion with hot babes are around and Gene Simmons libes upstairs and it's large and gothic, very good writing, it's more like a well made low budget movie with music videos inserted in.

Speaking of videos, there is a good stock of videos included from the mid 80's to the early make-up performances. Some of the videos are ""Tears are Falling"", ""Lick it Up"", ""I Love it Loud"", ""All Hells Breaking Loose"", Heavens on Fire"", ""Beth"" and more.

262565,2,6300227049,"Kiss is a great rock band. It is very difficult to find anything negative to say. Unfortunatly this dvd is an exeption. I saw the music video on t.v. for the live R n R allnight. Exposed was the dvd this version was on. So I bought the dvd -Gene and Paul Reality show-. Every important scene in the dvd was in the music video.
  I guess I was expecting a live concert of some type. Thank you",1189641600,,391,4.0
262566,2,6300227049,"This release was an excellent overview of KISS's 80's videos when it came out in 1987, but even then it was incomplete.  Videos for ""Shandi"", ""Sure Know Something"", ""A World Without Heroes"", and ""Thrills In The Night"" are conspicuously absent, and of course the band released many more videos after this compilation like ""Crazy Crazy Nights"", ""Reason To Live"" (featuring plenty of TOTALLY gratuitous near-nudity), ""Let's Put The X In Sex"", ""Hide Your Heart"", ""Unholy"", etc.  Some of these are available on other old VHS titles lazily re-released on DVD without extras, but KISS really needs to go back and put out a definitive compilation of all of their videos, going back to the primitive 70's promotional clips for ""C'mon An' Love Me"" and ""Rock And Roll All Night"" and continuing right on through to ""Psycho Circus"".

And while the in-between stuff here featuring KISS being interviewed in their faux communal home by former ""Fridays"" star Mark Blankfield was pretty much the equivalent of a ""DVD bonus material"" in its day, it's just distracting and passe now.  Again, a comprehensive collection of videos without any in-between crap is what this band is now most sorely missing from its catalog (and this is a band that really isn't missing anything from its catalog).  The ""Kissology"" DVD's are excellent historical documents of the group, but those only have a few token music videos on them as well.

What I find particularly hilarious is how it retailed for the ridiculous price of $29.99 on VHS 20 years ago (and thus I refused to purchase it), and now you can get it for 18 bucks on DVD.  Even so, I'm still not going to cave in and buy it now, I'm going to wait a bit and see if Kiss ever gets around to re-packaging all of their videos on DVD for us.",1187308800,2,1763,4.686084142394822
262567,4,6300227049,"By the time it was 1987, the hair metal era had been big for about four or five years, and even though Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were gone from KISS and they(KISS)had taken their makeup off, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley had managed to keep the band together,even though it meant having lineup changes and taking their makeup off. It was sad to see Ace Frehley and Peter Criss leave the band-but this made up for it.

This DVD starts off with Mark Blankfield(the interviewer in this DVD) talking to people watching the DVD with a little ""warning"" and then he goes over to Paul Stanley's mansion in Beverly Hills, California. When Blankfield gets there, he rings the doorbell, and Paul answers the door- except he is irritated because he claims that Mark has interrupted his ""beauty sleep""(there are a few females who accompany Stanley to the door in this scene)but when Paul finds out that a Barry Manilow concert coming up VERY soon could get in the way of KISS, Blankfield is let inside. Throughout the rest of this DVD, you get interviews with Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons,Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr(even though Kulick and Carr have very small parts in this)and you do get to see the ""beauties""during most of this DVD. There is video footage of KISS concerts from both the 70's and 80's to be found here, as well as six KISS videos from the 80's: ""Lick It Up"", ""All Hell's Breakin' Loose"", ""Heaven's On Fire"", ""Tears Are Falling"", ""Uh! All Night"", as well as the uncensored video for ""Who Wants To Be Lonely"", which MTV did NOT show on TV.

Highlights(the best scenes from this DVD)include:""The Paul Stanley Exercise Session"", the monkey that is dressed up like Sonny Crocket(Don Johnson's character on ""Miami Vice""), Paul's(Stanley)beauties telling him that their favorite KISS song is ""Uh! All Night""because it reminds him of them with Paul's response being ""I've Got Them Well Trained"", as well as all of the hot women that are to be found on this DVD.

My only complaints are that Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr were not given a big enough part in this DVD and also because they didn't say anything about the Barry Manilow concert at the end of the DVD that Paul Stanley and Mark Blankfield seemed so worried about at the beginning of this DVD, but other than that, this is KISS at their raunchiest, best, and funniest. Everybody who was in this had very cheesy acting-but that is part of what makes this behind the scenes look at KISS so hillarious.

A great treat for ALL KISS fans-especially(especially)male KISS fans.",1116892800,3,2524,4.703619909502263
262635,5,6300227049,"At least this release has a semblance of production to it.

The greatest moments are the Classic KISS footage, and not the throw away non-makeup material. It has taken KISS 20 years to realise that the best and most lucrative material is the out and out concert footage, with all of the blasting phantasmagoria that is the original KISS.

This video comes close to that original fantasy in some of the scripted material, but falls flat on oh too many ways, however, just before it goes through the floor, it gets rescued by another classic clip.

There definitely should have been more of Eric Carr in the Video, but not of Bruce Kulick. However, the original is still the best, and that footage is why I give this disc 5 stars. Unfortunately it would still be better in the bootleg version, but its nice to have the Authorised version. Pity they cannot do more releases of the Classic and Re-united KISS ( However short lived that fabulous fanatasy was).",1110758400,,955,4.6390532544378695
262636,4,6300227049,"If you've seen Motley Crue's ""Uncensored"", it's somewhat similar to this one. ""Konfidential"", ""Unplugged"" and ""Kiss My A**"" should also be picked up. So far the footage alone makes this one worth getting over the others. If you loved the 80s era KISS along with seeing some vintage clips, this one's the one you want to pick up.

I would love to see them put out a full length blown out video collection from over the years worthy of being a companion to the KISS box set including the original 4 playing the songs from ""Alive"" and ""Destroyer"" from beginning to end.",1107302400,,566,4.549019607843137

It is a comical setting, with alot of tongue (ha) -in-cheek stuff. Shows very little of the late Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick. As usual, Paul and Gene hog the camera, but it is a good history lesson for the casual fan.

262644,1,6300227049,"No, I do no take Kiss seriously. But, at least, in their best years the released a lot of classic rock albums, with great tunes that influenced literally hundreds of bands to come.
But in the middle eighties, they began to sell out to glam, and the mask was gone: the vanity and greed of Simmons and Stanley became clear for all to see. THat such hard-working and talented musicians became so shallow, it's something almost unbeliavable.
This video (now DVD) is a fake from beginning to end, so bad as the newest SECOND COMING. The interviews are terrible, the girls aorund Paul Stanley's swimming pool are just models, most of them porn stars like Candie Evans and Blondi. As for the viedos, there are a handful of good old-ones, but most of them are from the glam phase.

262685,5,6300227049,"Anyone who was dumb enough to take this video seriously when it was first released back in 87 are probably the same [people] who take Marilyn Manson and Slipknot seriously. This was a satire of all the rock cliches that the bands at the time tried to push as being so vital to their image. Kiss Exposed was nothing more and still is a visual feast for the eyes. From everything to the outrageous videos to naked babes to the 70's concert footage, this video was enjoyable as a good-natured goof. It showed that Kiss did not take themselves or the over the top lifestyle seriosly. They presented this with a sense of humor and even admitted in magazine interviews that this was no Spinal Tap. Gene even blows it trying to tell a joke at one point! My only regret is that there wasn't more of Eric and Bruce. As for their videos, I'll be one of the few to admit that I enjoyed the glam metal era much more than I enjoyed grunge (to depressing) or the nu metal movement.(no singing,no rhythm, no sense of humor).It was nice seeing rock stars be rock stars instead of acting like they're in PSA's.(public service announcements)Does Bono ring a bell? How about Sting or REM? They may feel like they have something important to say but have no real appeal for me. I don't even want to discuss the current batch of sullen rock bands. This is good escapist fun. And the best part is that even though the content on Kiss Exposed is contrived, it wouldn't be hard to imagine them actually living this way. Or myself for that matter. (Don't I wish)! They probably do anyway. So get off your pedestal and rock and roll all night and party every day!",1021680000,3,1637,4.423841059602649

The half-naked girls through the video are expected in a lifestyle like this, and even the reporter gets a little involved at one point!  My favorite videos from it are ""Lick It Up,"" ""Tears are Falling,"" and ""Heaven's On Fire."" It was interesting seeing the temporary guitar players, Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John. I was rather disappointed that they hardly focused on Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick. Simmons and Stanley provide almost all the talking in this video, and discuss the band's history as well as crack jokes and do all kinds of things to annoy the camera crew! It love it when Stanley puts Root Beer in his Bran Flakes!",1021248000,6,742,4.751937984496124
262687,3,6300227049,"Wow!  Watching this again was like reliving the 80's. Look at the clothes and the hair!  But Kiss knows their biggest impact happened in the 70's, so Kiss goes into the ""vault"" and come out with rare footage including Peter Criss singing ""Beth"" and a smoking Ace Frehley guitar solo. Seeing Paul perform ""Detroit Rock City"" in Australia in a falsetto note is  interesting. And that Brazilian crowd singing along to ""I Love It Loud"" is cool.
My bigest beef with this tape is Bruce and Eric (so vital to KISS in the 80's) are virtually ignored.  What a slight! Of course, Eric Carr is no longer with us.  I don't even know what the guy's speaking voice sounds like! There also should have been more footage of Vinnie Vincent.  I know they can't stand the guy, but he does deserve some credit for bringing back a heavier sound on ""Creatures of the Night"" and ""Lick It up.""
The comedic edge the tape has can be annoying at times. Gene's room where the girls have have their head in the walls like hunting trophies is in bad taste.  And they should have gone with  a more serious interviewer.
But the videos are nice, as are the live concert clips. It was Kiss' first foray into the video market with a documentary style video, but those who are seeking more information and a more serious tone will prefer Kiss' ""Extreme Close Up.""  It's not a bad video to watch.  It's just that Kiss could have done better and, later on, they did.",1019088000,,1428,4.436781609195402

But KISS has released some other long-form videos since then (Extreme Close-up, KISS Konfidential, etc.) that were more informative, more interesting, and less juvenile by comparison. ""KISS Exposed"" contains a lot of their videos from the 1980's, and the crisp DVD picture really enhances the colorfulness of them, especially ""Uh! All Night"" and ""Tears Are Falling"". I gotta admit, they look really good - much better than they ever did on VHS. And the interview segments with Mark Blankfield are kinda interesting, too. But the filler segments - with the girls, the pool, the breakfast table, etc - seem a bit silly now when you consider how much better the other long-form videos are. At best it is all goofy boys-will-be-boys fun. Nothing wrong with that, I guess.

Other people have talked about what's on it, and if you are a fan, it's a MUST. The only reason why it doesn't get a 5/5 star review is because of the serious lack of extras. Call me spoiled, but why couldn't KISS at least do a audio commentary?! How about bloopers? Anything?! It's just such a disappointment when other bands put out great DVDs that you can tell go the extra mile for their fans (ie: Def Leppard, Sum 41, etc...)",1017964800,,665,4.045454545454546

If you want a pretty good compilation of KISS videos then this is a good buy.  That's about it.  The ""interviews"" with Gene and Paul are arrogant and insincere.  They both take verbal shots at Ace and Peter for no good reason.

7806644,5,6300227049,"If you hate this video comp then you take yourself and the band way too seriously.  It's a funny, sometimes dumb, sometimes hilarious and sometimes cheesie script but it's still a really great home video from the band, their first ever released.  I've read that most of it takes place at Paul Stanley's house in Beverly Hills.  I'm not sure how true that is but it makes sense and probably kept production costs down.  The interview at the end with Gene and Paul talking about the early days of the band is really great and Gene's room the chamber of horrors is a funny scene.  I always get the feeling it's mocking the section of people who called KISS ""satanic"" in the 70s and early 80s and who read things into the band's image and music that really was never there but in their own heads.  The KISS archives and video vault scene is entertaining and a lot of fun it was the first exposure I had to a lot of the concert videos out there of the band from the 70s and early 80s and this comp really delivers in that area.",1325030400,,1022,4.269430051813472
