5278223,5,B00991167C,"the ab exercises are effective, very jillian michaels like. the cardio portions really get your heart rate up. it's a fun workout and you can customize the 5 workouts anyway you like.",1363046400,3,183,4.75
5278224,2,B00991167C,It's not an intense workout by all means but I was very sore after doing 3 of the 10 minute videos the first day. Mostly sore in my legs not my abs which I found strange. Felt like more of a lower body workout then an ab workout.,1362096000,3,229,3.7916666666666665
5278225,5,B00991167C,I always love the firm DVD's and this one was no different! The instructor was motivating and kept you going! Wish they were just a bit  longer and there wasn't a warm up for each one. One would have worked !!,1361059200,,209,4.097560975609756
5278226,5,B00991167C,Am Crazy About the firm product. Am play it as I Type. Thanks you so much. Lujuana Collins I Love It,1360627200,,100,3.8095238095238093
5278227,5,B00991167C,This the best AB workout to add to any other workout you have. You can really feel the moves on your ABS. My stomach is more tones just after 5 workout with this dvd. I will highly recommend the workout.,1358121600,8,203,4.1
5278228,5,B00991167C,"This is a great addition to any Firm workout DVD collection!  All five workouts offer levels from beginner to intermediate and can be bumped up on your own to advanced.  The 10 minute cardio blast and 20 minute cardio workout really get your heart pumping while toning up your midsection.  The 3 10 minute toning sections really get at your abs from different angles so you can feel your entire midsection working.  As always, Rebeckah does a wonderful job of instructing and gives you plenty of warning before the moves change.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a short ab workout that gives its job done.  Personally I like to do any of these workouts as an addition to my regular cardio/strength routine.  I also use heavier weights and do the advanced moves the entire workout to make it challenging.",1355270400,19,824,4.680555555555555
5278277,5,B00991167C,Love it...just didn't like all the advertisement in the beginning ...,1449705600,,69,5.363636363636363
5278278,5,B00991167C,A good mixture of exercises.  Easy to follow,1446595200,,44,4.5
5278279,3,B00991167C,"I love the very early Firm videos, but even the later ones are good. I wish the originals were easier to find.",1443744000,,110,4.045454545454546
5278280,1,B00991167C,"What a disappointment. I can't see what jumping jacks and (yes) planks have to do with strengthening the abs. Most of all five of these routines are done as high impact exercises standing up. No regular floor abs work. I thought this would be like The Firm's wonderful 5-day abs DVD, but it has none of that. They should just call it 10-minute exercise routines. That would me more accurate. If you're looking for crunches and that sort of thing, this isn't the DVD for you",1434067200,,473,4.511627906976744
5278281,5,B00991167C,Another great firm workout,1431129600,,26,5.75
5278282,1,B00991167C,I was hoping for an AB work out this is more of a cardio workout ..,1427414400,,67,3.25

5278284,5,B00991167C,the firm rocks! you really see results after 10 work out have lost the weight of my two pregnancies with these workouts and i am still using and buying them!! after my pregnancies was overweight and lost over 80lbs in a short period of time with a healthy diet and you can also shed a lot and i mean a lot without diet as well... but don't go eating like crazy.. ;),1420675200,3,365,4.083333333333333
5278285,4,B00991167C,i like it! It really concentrate on your abs but too quick to change in moves.,1419724800,,78,3.9375
5278286,1,B00991167C,"She goes way too fast!  It was so frustrating because I'm trying to do what she says, but she's going so fast that by the time I see what she's doing, she's moved on to something else!  I had it in for not even 5 minutes before I gave up and went back to P90X.",1419552000,3,260,3.709090909090909
5278297,5,B00991167C,"This is not my favorite workout by the Firm.  It's great that it is broken down into short workouts or one long workout, however some of the moves are hard to do and very little cues or information given on how to do the moves.  It does not always flow smoothly.  I have other Firm workouts and love them, this one not so much.",1417478400,,327,4.078125
5278298,4,B00991167C,love love love i am not ready for some of the workouts so stick with the cardio abs for now but they are all great and hope some day i can do all the moves,1417392000,2,155,3.4571428571428573
5278299,2,B00991167C,Did not keep me interested. Didn't like the workout.,1416614400,,52,4.888888888888889
5278300,3,B00991167C,"I'm surprised at all the postive reviews.  I thought this dvd was just ok.
it could have been designed much better. The moves are too all over the place - a little of this a little of that basically I never really feel the burn consistently.
it would be better if this dvd would have been put  into 2 30 min parts, half cardio + standing moves and half concentrated mat work.
there are some good moves thrown in but for me it feels disjointed.
One segment is basically orthopedic back exercises. Nothing wrong with that but not very high intensity at all.",1416268800,,555,4.378640776699029
5278301,5,B00991167C,"You know it's a real ab work out when you think you're going to vomit half way through. Don't let that discourage you, it just means this work out is very efficient at hitting several of the abdominal muscles at the same time. Compound exercises are perfect for losing belly fat.",1414972800,2,279,4.490196078431373

5278303,4,B00991167C,The Firm has never failed to meet my fitness needs. Just another quality program to add to my collection.,1409961600,2,105,4.578947368421052
5278304,3,B00991167C,This one is ok. Ive only used it a few times. I hate the cardio they include in these dvds. I guess im more of a weight girl. P90X is a better one. :),1409011200,,150,3.4411764705882355
5278305,5,B00991167C,Great workout dvd with the right amount of challenge fr both beginner and advanced.,1408838400,,83,5.0
5278306,4,B00991167C,"I've been doing The Firm workouts for about 18 years. This DVD is like the others, a great workout that really gets your heart pumping. There are a variety of 10-minute workouts that focus on the abs/core, as well as a 20-minute cardio blast segment. My only real complaint is that the choreography is too jammed with movements, so it's difficult for the instructor to cue properly before running into the next move. I think they could have removed about 1/4 the movements and still had a great workout session. However, I'll definitely keep this in the DVD rotation for my weekly workouts.",1403568000,5,590,4.737864077669903
5278341,5,B00991167C,"I like this as it uses weights
And has ten minute segments therefore u don't feel Overwhelmed or worn out or bored with the moves",1403481600,2,129,4.2
5278342,3,B00991167C,Very difficult to follow. Her routine was all over the place. I will stick to basic crunches since im not a trained dancer.,1402531200,,123,4.391304347826087
5278343,5,B00991167C,"This is a great DVD.  It follows the typical FIRM format.  I never understand why people complain that the instructors aren't clear with the directions or go too fast.  Do they only do the workout once?  It becomes a routine and after the third time, anyone should know what move is coming up next.  With my diet, I started seeing results within in 2 weeks, but I did at least 2 of the segments each time.",1401494400,6,405,4.276315789473684
5278344,5,B00991167C,I absolutely love this workout DVD. It's easy to follow and the workouts are only 10 minutes. Great way to sculpt your abs.,1401408000,2,123,4.391304347826087
5278345,5,B00991167C,"This is a great core workout, it is a lot of fun and a great addition to my firm collection. I love that you can customize from 10 to 30 min or more. you get a great workout even if you are short on time.",1395705600,2,204,3.5555555555555554
5278346,1,B00991167C,Not much of a workout. Barely felt a thing. not sure i understand how some of those moves actually work on abs. highly disappointed.,1394150400,,132,4.541666666666667
5278347,5,B00991167C,My wife bought this DVD to replace one that was worn out.  She uses it nightly for a quick workout and loves the series.,1393891200,4,120,4.0
5278348,5,B00991167C,"I really like the new Flat Abs solution, I am working at getting familiar with each work out on the DVD, so I can do each work out with confidence, and really pay attention to the moves to get the most benefit by doing the work outs correctly.
I like to do my cardio and then pop this in and pick a work out !!!",1391472000,3,311,3.8
5278349,5,B00991167C,"Really great abdominal workouts. My favorite is the 20 minute Cardio Core workout. It's great by itself if you're wanting an ""easier"" workout day but it's also a great add-on if you want to workout more on a particular day. The DVD includes 5 different workouts. All of the segments are 10 minutes each except for the Cardio segment. I love Rebekah Sturkie, she's one of my favorite Firm instructors. She gives great cues and is always motivating. There are modifications for all of the exercises if you are a beginner. I highly recommend The Firm: Flat Abs Solution.",1374019200,9,567,4.737373737373737
5278350,4,B00991167C,I like it very much. I would say I love it but I cant keep up with the twenty minute session.  Rebecca does a great job I love the way it is broken down into ten minute sessions. Maybe it is my age that is kicking my but.....48,1371513600,9,227,3.7291666666666665
8537865,1,B00991167C,"I have almost all of the Firm videos (old and new) and I was excited to get this ab one. I alternate my workouts and on the days I get outside and ride my bike I like to finish with a good ab workout. These abs are almost all done standing, squating, planking and goes way too fast. My legs are worked out from the bicycling and I want a good ab workout, no a mini lower body workout. I love the old Firm 5-day ab workout with the old instructors and the tried and true ab moves on the floor. I will donate this to the library and stay with the old. Some things don't need fixn, like floor work for abs.",1518393600,,603,3.910569105691057

8537867,4,B00991167C,Longtime FIRM fan. Pleasantly surprised by this one. I love Rebekah but was expecting only an ab video. This video has a 20 min cardio segment and 4 10 min ab segments. Not fond of the one that involves going from knees to standing quickly ( hurts my knees) but you can modify. Good workout if you do all segments together. Runs an hour all included.,1489017600,2,350,4.318181818181818

Some of the routines were a little odd for me but only because I received it today and popped it right in the DVD player. Once I use it a couple more times I will grasp all the moves!  The first 4 10 minute workouts are all abs, the last routine is 20 minutes of abs and cardio mixed! Great workout all together!",1458000000,2,428,3.9767441860465116
