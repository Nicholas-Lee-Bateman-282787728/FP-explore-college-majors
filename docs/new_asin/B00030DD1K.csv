2155498,5,B00030DD1K,"I got this conference late in the evening and couldn't stop watching it.  It was so informative and compelling and TRUE.  I finished watching the conference early the next day.  I have since ordered all of Emmerson's books and read and re-read them all.  It has greatly helped me understand my husband and my relationship 100% better.  Check out his loveandrespect website for more insight and information--it is like a light bulb swiched on for me and you can read some of his articles and testamonials if you are still not sure.  I am trying to talk my husband into attending one of his conferences live.  I cannot wait to get his new book coming out in January.  If you are having any trouble, major or minor in your relationship, this WILL help you.",1165881600,12,753,4.567164179104478
2155499,5,B00030DD1K,"If over 50% of Christian marriages are failing, the Christian population is doing a miserable job of following God's word. The focus of this series is on two words: Love and Respect. While our culture belives in unconditional love, it often doesn't believe unconditional respect is important. Women crave unconditional love and men crave unconditional respect. Our minds were wired by God to be different. We were created in the image of God as male and female. Our sexes think about things differently-""not wrong, just different.""

Dr. Emerson Eggerichs describes the two sexes as wearing different headphones and glasses. Men wear blue glasses and blue headphones. Women wear pink glasses and pink headphones. A man might say to his wife, ""I have nothing to wear!"" A wife might say the same words and mean she has nothing ""new."" A man, on the other hand, might mean he has nothing ""clean."" As Dr. Emerson says repeatedly, ""Not wrong, just different.""

I do find the ""Love and Respect"" DVD is an excellent marriage resource. I haven't finished watching all of the DVDs yet, but what I have watched thus far is awesome.  Dr. Eggerichs really is a great presenter, has done lots of research, and most importantly, validates all things he talks about with the word of God.  If Christians would look to the Bible for the answers to life, we wouldn't have so many problems.  Eggerichs uses examples from the Old and New Testament to speak about love and respect.  Whatever people want to believe, the fact is, men and women are different.  We were created by God to have different roles in the marriage.

I would give this dvd series over 5 stars if I could; it's that good.  Any couple desiring marriage should watch this series.  Any couple that is married should watch this series too.  Marriage must become the sacred institution it once was.  I'm really thankful Dr. Eggerichs presents uncorrupted biblical truths in this day and age.",1161734400,28,1935,4.83030303030303
2155500,5,B00030DD1K,"After watching the first DVD as a preview to an upcoming Love and Respect conference , we ordered the full set.  My husband wanted to stay up all night watching the DVDs.

Does my husband usually show any interest in this sort of thing? Not really.  Why the interest now?  Because Dr. Eggerichs has insight and wisdom regarding a man's needs that is NOT expressed in today's society.  We have implemented his suggestions and they work.

I wish we had watched these on our honeymoon!  They are the best investment we've ever made.  We learned more from these in one weekend that in 10 years of everything else we've ever tried or done.

From now on, they will be the only gift we give to newly married couples - nothing else compares.

2155501,5,B00030DD1K,"We are not even done watching this yet....  Our small group is doing this study right now and it is SO true, everything they say is the honest to God's truth.  It so clearly illustrates why men and women are so different and we all think only our spouse does those odd things when it turns out that everyone deals with all of these issues all of the time.  You are given insight into what the other sex thinks and feels and what you can do to improve the situation instead of making it worse.  I know I want to be able to watch this again and again, so I guess I will have to buy my own copy of it. I highly encourage you to watch this series., your marriage is worth it.",1143072000,19,671,3.985074626865672
2155502,5,B00030DD1K,"My wife and I just attended the Love & Respect Conference and I'm astounded to be the first reviewer of the DVD. If you are familiar with it, speak up so that those of us who are skeptical about these types of things will be emboldened to act (and might even buy the DVD or attend a conference).

SUMMARY: If you are like me you will wonder out loud, ""if most couples experience the same/similar things that we do, then why in the world did it take this long for a person to articulate these very simple truths?"" I cannot answer that question.

I was skeptical about the presentation style.  However, Emerson Eggerich is an excellent and very entertaining speaker. I was less skeptical about the content because I felt sure it would be the same old stuff repackaged. However, the content will blow you away!  The ideas the Eggerichs discuss are not their own, but described by him as ""hidden in plain sight.""  You will nod in the affirmative (or shake your head in disbelief) throughout the DVD as the Eggerichs' put words to (or state more clearly) your thoughts and feelings. You will be tempted to nudge your spouse (or vice versa) and say, ""that is SO you.""

FOR MEN: this DVD will put into words some of those things you yourself have been unable to explain to your wife - you know what I mean - those times you've been mad or upset by something she's done / doing so you just have to walk away.  Learn why that is, how you and she make it worse, and what to do to fix it.

FOR WOMEN (from a man's perspective): this DVD says (in language that a man can understand) all those things that you have been telling him over and over and over again, but he just doesn't get, as well as why we husbands do what we do. Learn how you and he make things worse without meaning to and how to fix it. Knowledge is power and I hope you will use it wisely.

For the husband or wife going it alone: this DVD tells you why you should even bother. I believe that it will motivate and empower you in ways that you cannot imagine.

FOR THE NON-CHRISTIAN:  Did you know that Christians divorce as frequently (or almost) as non-Christians? Did you know that ""Christians"" are the #1 stumbling block to you even giving God a chance? If you are married, but think your marriage could/should be better than it currently is, this DVD is worth a look - you have nothing to lose, they'll give your money back if it doesn't change your marriage.

FOR THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS (from as big a sinner as any): In addition to all the above, you will be reminded of things that are drowned out by the world: where you came from, what you were created for, what is hoped for and expected of you, and why you should be willing to die for (BUT ALSO LIVE FOR) your marriage. You will be humbled to discover yet one more way in which you underestimate your God who is omnipotent, omnicient and omnipresent.

FYI - I have absolutely no affiliation with the Eggerichs or their products. This is my personal review of their conference(not even my wife has read it). If I have mis-characterized anything, my apologies and I hope you will correct it.",1131926400,166,3126,4.3782383419689115
2155503,5,B00030DD1K,This conference had i got it first i would need no other conference.  I read all the reviews some of the negative ones made me negative but the Lord let my ears be open because He knows i needed the info.  Please have a open mind when he talks about the feminist movement.  He is not trying to put down women.  This man has a phd in ministry and science of communication.  He and his wife lived what they teach I learned instantly and help my marriage in 5 minuets after the dvd.  I watched alone and then with my husband I needed to learn first so i can hear and not blame him...but just concentrate on me.  I recommend this before marriage and after marriage.  Also if infidelity or major problems has entered your marriage this will help even you.. may God bless you all because you are seeking His way of doing things...I will order at least 10 copies if i can get them its the best money i have spent which i think was 47.00.  It was a God send.  I cant say enough about this conference...DVD WORK BOOK INCLUDED!!!  just got this conference and I watched all 5 and will rewatch with my husband.  I am wanting to fix me not my husband.  So we can be better for God.. even if you are blaming your spouse...give this conference a chance and you and your spouse will be the friends that you were when you met.,1506556800,4,1310,4.192

As a husband this video truly tugged my heart and put so much of the dynamics of my marriage relationship in perspective.

As a pastor and pastoral counselor, I see the urgency of presenting this material to the vast majority of the couples that I work with.

Dr. Eggerichs presents eye-opening, vital information in comedic and pallatable style with compassion, understanding and conviction. I absolutely love this material!

This should be required pre marriage material...BUT it should be reviewed each year. The information is so relevant to real life. We actually attended the conference. Grown men were crying everywhere as Dr Eggerichs nails the issues that each gender faces and explains why!! This is mind blowing. My husband and I now are able to counsel others, and even singles because this information affects how each gender better communicates to the other. Dr Eggerichs uses national and international studies that he often helped design to show and prove how differently each sex reasons and reacts to the same information! He was also a Pastor and is an well educated Christian, but you don't have to be a Christian to appreciate the information presented.

2155539,1,B00030DD1K,"The author discusses women respecting their husband's unconditionally. The Bible tells us to hate what God hates and love what God loves. There is a huge difference between respect and worship and I believe the author suggest a woman should worship her husband. There is an example given in the book of a woman's husband who was unfaithful to her. The woman blamed herself for the affair because the mistress treated the husband like a god who could do no wrong. Only God should be on the throne of anyone's heart and only God is worthy of praise and worship and the only one Who is blameless, pure light without a trace of darkness.  Moses's wife held him accountable for not circumcising their son according to the law.  She saved Moses life by circumcising their son.

The author also make reference to when David's wife despised him in her heart and how she was barren because of this.  The author neglects to tell the rest of this story.  David was dancing and praising God for victory in battle, not because he was abusive to her emotionally or physically or behaving like a drunkard or liar.

Another issue I see is the author's conveniently using the work force for the husband as related to love while minimizing the importance of respect to a woman. The author states a woman needs to be loved and a husband needs to be respected but is applying the needs at home and using examples from the office to support the male perspective. I am a professional woman and am not concerned with if I am loved at work but I want respect from my supervisor, employee, and colleagues.  I also want respect from my husband as much as I want love. These examples and analogies are confusing at best and manipulative at worst.

I also believe the author exaggerates the importance of respect to the point of arrogance and worship and minimizes the power and importance of love. It was love that held Jesus on the cross, not respect.  The Bible is quoted as saying ""God is love"" not God is respect. The Bible also says for God so loved the world, not for God so respected the world. There is also a reference made to the disciple Jesus loved, not the disciple who Jesus respected.  Additionally, the Bible says Christians are to be known by their love for each other, not respect. One must love first and respect and everything else will follow.

The book has some good tips but the author really needs to be mindful of context. I was very disappointed with how the author manipulates the Bible and other concepts to get right back to supporting and justifying arrogance and ego. God despises a haughty spirit. This conference isn't about respect but worship and the author does an outstanding job confusing the terms to the point of reducing a woman to worshipping her husband and feeling guilty if she doesn't in addition to putting the audience on a guilt trip for calling and ego trip what it is when a man is underserved respect and worship regardless to his behavior or the condition of his heart.

Since the author wants to use the work environment as an example it must be noted that in the work environment respect is not unconditional but earned.  Stop talking out of two sides of your face. This series was insulting, annoying, and dishonest. I feel I wasted my money and paid to be insulted and deceived.",1477526400,12,3308,4.576988155668359

The truths presented in this material have set us free from the crazy cycle that we were spinning out of control in.  I truly believe that if both partners have any measure of goodwill in them, then a fulfilling, healthy relationship is theirs once they understand and apply this material.  That said, I have to give credit where credit is due and the truth is God showed up and changed our hearts.  Still that wouldn't have happened had we not somehow learned these truth's about men and women.  In my opinion, the women's side is told and understood to overkill in our culture, but the men's side is almost totally ignored outside of what we learned in this seminar.  In that regard, I think that is an important part of what sets this material apart from everything else we have tried, which was a lot.",1444003200,,948,4.541176470588235

2155586,5,B00030DD1K,"First of all, to set the stage, I'm a Christian female and I'd been married for just over a year when I took this study with my husband (in fall 2013). I think the worst part about this study is that you have a certain expectation that men and women get an equal representation during the study and I would say that's not entirely accurate. I didn't think the portion explaining women was anything special or particularly interesting; it's what we'd heard it other marital studies and didn't blow us away.

That being said, I didn't feel the loss. The portion on men - how they think, feel, etc. - blew me away. Never in my life have I had the male perspective explained to me the way it's explained here. I found myself frequently looking at my husband in shock and saying ""is that really how you feel/think?"". My husband was equally surprised, because 1) he'd never known how to articulate some of these emotions and thoughts and 2) he'd never been told that it was ok for him to feel or think that way.

This study was the beginning of my husband and I learning to communicate properly for the first time. Eggerichs really focuses of the idea of the ""good willed spouse"", which basically means that you should always assume your spouse is not trying to hurt you and that it is far more likely that miscommunication is the culprit.

My husband and I began working toward ""communicating in purple"" - making our perspectives make sense to each other. We also learned that just because it doesn't make sense to us, doesn't mean the other is wrong. It just means they feel differently. I also became acutely aware of how accidentally disrespectful I was with both my words and actions.

I could ramble forever about this, but I'll close my review with one final comment. If you will allow it, this study and all its concepts will change the way you communicate and will open you up to understand your spouse in a way you never have before. I can't recommend it enough.",1436054400,4,1966,4.514044943820225

2155631,5,B00030DD1K,"I am extremely pleased with the content of this video conference. Dr. Eggerichs has really hit on a biblical principal and more accurately, a biblical command given to married persons. I personally have full confidence in the inspired word of God, and Dr. Eggerichs uses his knowlege and insight to not only show us what is significant about the biblical commands of love and respect in the marraige relationship, but why it is so necessary.
Dr. Eggerichs has a great delivery, and is very easy to listen to. His wife Sarah assists on one of the videos also.
The quality of the video is pretty good overall, but could have been a little better. But it is not such a issue that it affects the listener's ability to take in the message or one's ability to present the material in a class setting.
My thanks go to Dr. Eggerichs for his work to put this together. It has helped me to understand much more about myself and my wife. I highly recommend this series to any married couples. In fact, it should be considered essential to making the most of your marriage!

I understand how people can have a bad taste in their mouths from teachings that pick and choose bible verses to make a point. Lots of them do that.

2155637,1,B00030DD1K,"Not a fan of this at all.  I published this review under the book as well because we were watching the DVD and reading the book together.  We stopped watching the DVD series after the 3rd DVD because of his errors and his ranting at the end.  I also tossed my book.:

1. He leaves out the following scripture: 1 Peter 3:7-8 Likewise, you husbands should live with your wives in understanding, showing RESPECT to the weaker FEMALE sex, since we are joint heirs of the gift of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. Where is this in his book or on his DVD series?

2. Also he states that men know they are loved, women aren't sure. So doesn't it make sense that men would respond they want respect in his survey question? They already know they are loved! Women still don't know, so they are still trying to get love. But in the meantime, these women that feel unloved are also supposed to be working on respecting their husbands. What is the motivation? If it is based on fear? Then this would not be biblical as stated in 1 John. And by fear I mean, fear of their husbands leaving.

3. Proverbs 5:18 says ""let you manhood be a blessing, rejoice in the wife of your youth. Let her charms and tender embrace satisfy you. Let HER LOVE ALONE fill you with delight"". Where does it say respect? Also Proverbs 31 gives an excellent overview of ""an ideal wife"" Where is the mention of this?

4. He states that women are now divorcing twice as often as men. The statistic is still the same, roughly 50%, but women are initiating it more then men. Why? Just google it. Advice being given to men by attorneys. Women need to start the divorce process to start receiving child support. 75% of women have to have their ex-husbands wages garnished. This is the guy that was supposedly willing to die for you and now doesn't want to pay child support?

5. Men would die for you - women do you get it? Yes, because I would die for my children. We get it, not an only male trait.

6. He states repeatedly ""women these are your sons"" and honestly it drew me back in every time. I have sons and I want them to have a good married life. I have been blessed to have married my college sweet heart and we have been together 23 years, so I want the same for my sons. But when he gives the example of the guy throwing the plate at his wife's head, I was expecting ""men, these are your daughters would you want someone to do that to her?"" Instead we got the guy cooled off in jail, the wife sent the author of Love and Respect an email and didn't even mention it in the email. Emerson shook his head like ""wow that's a women"". And they discovered that it was all do to not enough love and respect. Sound like prideful behavior to me.

7. Men don't really need to talk and either do women, it's not really biblical according to the author. He states a study where pairs of men or women were put into a room and observed. Men didn't really talk, women talked up a storm. Men sat shoulder to shoulder and just got their points across. I'm not really disputing this, but is that what Jesus did or did he tell his apostles stories. Did he preach on the mount? Who did he say was the one who understood more about listening Mary or Martha? Jesus TALKED and SHARED. He didn't sit and have his ""energy"" absorbed. So really women are supposed to do this? We're supposed to sit there in silence and watch our husband paint and work on their cars? Who is watching the kids in this scenario? That's irresponsible and a selfish recommendation on his part.

The study he cites looked at boy/men pairs and girl/women pairs at different age groups from ages 5-6 through age 21. The group that communicated most effectively were 16 year old boys. So he suggests this is how married couples should communicate. Again, irresponsible. This type of communication was NOT as effective in the male groups at the older ages or younger ages, just at age 16 - meaning it wasn't even a great way to communicate for older male adults. He lost a lot of credibility since there are wonderful studies between married men and women to indicate effective communications styles, however, they wouldn't fit into his view of how women should be seen but not heard. 16 year old boys are also really great at playing video games and sleeping in late. Should married couples emulate that as well?

8. He misquotes Chapter 5 of Timothy and states it references how men are to treat their wives and how wives are to respond. This entire chapter is about widows, not about married couples.

9. States women are suing for sexual harassment if a man opens a door for them. My husband has to be aware of sexual harassment policy at his work and he showed me the presentation. This is used as an example of GOOD and COURTEOUS gestures between men and women. Emerson did not provide a source and I could not find a single reference when I googled. Did anyone else? Just curious.

10. This book should be called ""Love and Pride"" not ""Love and Respect"" for he is using a modern day definition of respect not what was intended in the bible. Jesus loved and respected his church and he did it without expecting anything in return. He never demanded it, he loved and nurtured it and when we don't today, what happens? People leave the church. Didn't Jesus share his power. Didn't he say to be a servant. Didn't Jesus even share with Judas, who he KNEW was going to betray him? Aren't men the ""Jesus"" in the relationship and women the ""church"". If we follow the modern day definition of respect, then we cannot understand why Jesus did that. Eggerich is really missing the mark here. Quotes some bible verses but really misses the point of the bible. He is too busy seeing the speck in the eyes of women to notice the giant two by four sticking out of his.

11. Boiling down emotions to only two - Love and Respect didn't work throughout the bible either. Jesus was passionate with the money changers. People felt joy, peace, sometimes disappointment. This to me was the biggest issue. I have never felt that my husband doesn't love or respect me and he never felt that way either. But it was the only two options the author provided. We have felt anger, pride, hypocrisy, as well as a plethora of positive emotions. Just because my husband and I don't agree doesn't mean he doesn't love me and I have never interpreted it that way. Either did others in my study. Again, a flawed question. When you only give people two options and they have to pick one, then they do. He designed the question that way to fit neatly into his black and white curriculum.",1295827200,35,6584,4.3985209531635165
2155638,5,B00030DD1K,"My husband and I have always loved the Lord and our marriage was sitting on the foundation of our Jesus, Heavenly Father from the day we said, ""I do."" Shortly after we got married (we were 21 and 22) we ran into many issues that led to years of struggles. We never ""gave up"" because of our Biblical foundation. Yet I wondered how the Lord would ever want us to be ""stuck"" in such a miserable situation. It took 7 years of marriage for us to find this DVD series. Our church was starting ""Love and Respect"" as our home group study.
We figured it was another one of those ""pick me up, and lets try again"" pep talk marriage hooplas. But we jumped into it with the small group hoping the best......WOW, after the first 30 minute session we were blown away at the way Dr Emerson Eggrich explained the very basic principles the Lord has laid out for us. We had been blinded, deceived and robbed from 7 years of marriage, marriage that could have been solid and strong.
We are now going into our 9th year of marriage and it has never been better! =) Yah, we argue, we disagree and tension gets high. We have new found skills though to help us through. We are ""good willed"" people on the SAME TEAM, just clogging each others air tanks up a bit. The good Doc has made it very simple for anyone to follow, simple, Biblical, and straight forward to BOTH genders. AMAZING!!!
Without this DVD series I am sure my husband and I would have been divorced by now. Horrible to say but the full truth. I URGE, URGE, URGE anyone who thinks they are ""done"" to watch this series with your spouse, all the way through. Then make that decision. God is so gracious and good to us. He continues to love and forgive us each time we sin, screw up, and repeatedly do what he asks us ""not"" to do. Yet he sticks with us, never giving up or threading to leave our relationship. We must stay strong and do all we can to make these bonds work. Marriage is truly a wonderful, fun, blessed commitment when done in a Godly fashion. My heart longs to see the marriages in this world hold strong and be held at the utmost important, next to ones personal walk with our Savior.

2155644,5,B00030DD1K,"Love and Respect, by Emerson Eggerichs, is a lengthy DVD set that records a series of presentations given at a marriage seminar.  This resource is a very insightful presentation of the unique needs of men and women and how to meet them.

The DVD is basically a video of a marriage conference - long lectures to a large crowd with workbooks.  The speaker is very engaging and humorous, with plenty of real-life scenarios and examples.  Some content could definitely be condensed into a shorter time-format.

* Energetic, engaging speaker
* Very humorous
* Lots of illustrations and examples
* Long - 5 DVDs, each 1.5 hours long!
* Minimal content rephrased in different ways over long period of time
* Breaks after 30 minutes for optional small group discussion
* Format: 1 person lecturing in a church auditorium
* Some unprofessional video (fuzzy or blurry shots, quick zoom)
* Audio is clear
* Sensitive to the unchurched, speaker became Christian as an adult
* Speaker has 30 years of preaching ministry and PhD
* Emphasizes good will of offending parties, non-Biblical approaches to marriages

Session 1 - The Crazy Cycle

The notebook accompanying the DVD series is a bit simplistic.  (I wrote ""love"" and ""respect"" 4x each on the first page filling in the blanks.)  With the exception of the application list accompanying DVD 4, the workbook has very minimal value other than listing many Scripture references and verses used to support the concepts.
The content in session 1 is very creative - the first time you hear it.  For many Christians who have heard of Eggerichs illustrations before from radio presentations or sermons, this material is like a review of some basic groundwork - that men and women are different, communicate differently, and have different needs.  Personally, I found little new information in DVD 1, but I still found it to be important enough to review.  Besides, the presentation is almost entertaining, so I did not mind reviewing it.

Session 2 - The Energizing Cycle

This session is more application-based with more specific applications of how to use and apply the concepts of love/respect.  DVD 2 is addressed to men, to help men know how to love their wives.  It starts by emphasizing that it's good for men to be men and re-emphasizes sensitivity to the unchurched.  There is a strong complementarian viewpoint at 50:00, emphasizing need for valuing men and countering the cultural elevation of feminine value.  But he did this in the context of affirming the worth of women as well as the strengths of women's differences.

I felt that DVD 3 was the most unique contribution of this material. This session reviewed ""how to energize your husband by meeting his needs.""  It approached marriage from a complementarian model and truly valued and esteemed the needs of men.  I felt that he was actually speaking up in an anti-male culture and being pro-male without being anti-female.

The repetitiveness of the beginning turns out to be a pedagogical technique.  Emerson continually refers to same themes, like ""Your spouse has a need you don't have.  Is that okay?""  He clearly is trying to get people to remember his main emphases through repetition.

DVD 4 was given by Mrs. Eggerichs, and she summarized the specific ways men and women have asked to be loved or respected.  Each letter for the acronym (COUPLE or CHAIRS) has three ways to act out each element.  The applications are based on the responses Dr. Eggerichs has received from men and women who went through the seminar.  This DVD was the least valuable in the set, as it could easily by summarized by the 2 pages in the handout (13-14).  Mrs. Eggerichs' stories were not as witty, humorous, or insightful, but he is a tough act to follow.  It was helpful to see Dr. Eggerichs' wife have a chance to speak, if for no other reason but to see if she would have the same view as Dr. Eggerichs.  She did support his viewpoint and conclusions, echoing many of his statements.

Session 3 - The Rewarding Cycle

DVD 5 provides encouragement for couples to keep on doing love and respect even if there is little effect right away.  Little new information is in this DVD.  It's mainly an attempt to motivate someone to do a job ""well done,"" as the marriage essentially reflects your love/respect for God.  He also encourages someone to come to faith in Christ.  He seems to be preparing people for real-life responses after the conference.  He concludes by asking people to make a public commitment or decision .

If I was going to do this in a small group setting, I would have the first DVD watched in 1 session.  This would require 1.5 hours of video, and there would not be a lot of discussion afterwards.  But for DVDs 2 and 3, I would break it into the six 25-minute video sessions followed by 30 minutes of discussion.  DVD 4 and 5 would be optional, but do not need to be broken up into the 25-minute sessions.

Overall, I highly recommend this resource for a church to purchase to use with couples in its congregation.  The price tag ($145) makes the set impractical for individual purchase, but it could be used in a church setting or shared amongst a larger body.",1276646400,11,5169,4.751964085297419

I believe the advice comes straight from God's word, which if taken seriously and applied in marriage, any marriage can become the marriage union God intended.  We humans make things so difficult.  If we would just do what God asks of us, and get rid of our own stubbornness and selfishness, things just fall into place.

2155650,5,B00030DD1K,"This is a terrific study to complete as a couple or in a small group of couples. Eggerichs is lively, engaging, and entertaining. He also clearly shares Biblical truth regarding the marriage relationship as it is intended. He does this in a way that is respectful of non-Christians, but it allows him to clarify the background and development of his basic love and respect premise. We have used this study to lead small groups of couples and we have friends who have led several groups through this study. Everyone one of them has appreciated the humor and realistic perspective Eggerichs offers in his presentation.

Seven hours is a lot of video to watch, but it is easily broken down into smaller chunks. A study could be done efficiently in 7 or 14 sessions or more. Most of the small group studies I am familiar with having done this study have completed it in 10 to 14 sessions, but it is possible to move along more quickly. Discussion time may be adjusted to fit within an alloted time.

The Participant's Guide that can be used to accompany the DVD may be useful for people to capture main ideas in note form. It may also be helpful for kinetic learners who need something to do (take notes) to remain engaged. However, several folks in our groups found the Participant's Guide a bit difficult to match up with the DVD and keep the notes caught up. It seems to me that there are long sections of the presentation that do not refer to the Participant's Guide, then there will be short bursts where he will cover much of the printed material quickly. Other than the trouble some folks had with the Participant's Guide, this is an excellent study and is worth the investment of time to work through it.",1265587200,,1708,4.578431372549019

In every marriage study we've done in the past love has been the focus and I've gotten completely enthusiastic and my husband tried for as long as he could stand but then things would fall apart again.  But, this series presented the new understanding of the need for unconditional respect in a relationship as well.  The realization that my husband desired it just as strongly as my need for unconditional love really rocked my world... in a good way!
The most significant change in our relationship (still some 5 years after we did the series) is the way that we fight.  We are not perfect by any means, but when conflict arises we are finally able to work our way through it to a conclusion by understanding the different perspective each other has on the issue or the natural offenses that come because we are wired differently.  When there is a problem we both know the way that we need to approach each other, too.  (I have to admit that being respectful was so effective I almost felt manipulative.  It was not natural, it was a choice, based on what he said he needed, and it moved his heart to respond in love.  Completely amazing!).

I bought this for my wife and I and it changed our thinking abought the other so much, that I bought another set for my grown children",1259280000,,325,4.174603174603175
2155657,5,B00030DD1K,"A great presentation of this topic!  The speaker is funny, practical and gives down to earth advice that works!  Especially good for husbands who probably prefer watching a DVD rather than reading the book or going to a seminar...within 5 minutes of watching it my husband said ""That is us!""",1254960000,2,291,4.8
2155658,5,B00030DD1K,"I have so much to say about this but so little time to write. I just went to a video conference at my church and this has really impacted my wife and I so much. He is dead on with all of his examples he gives for men and women and brings so much humor into it as well. If you only do half of the things he says this will change you marriage for the better by 100% This DVD is worth every penny....you cannot put a price tag on having a wonderful marriage. This also would be a great gift for any married couple, a couple that is dating, or even single people to make them aware of how it all works. Anyways great conference!

2155659,5,B00030DD1K,"I don't think I've ever used the term 'changed my life', but the information here has done just that. The truths spoken are easily recognized and make an immediate impact. I wish every married couple could see these DVD's.",1203552000,7,222,4.717948717948718
2155660,5,B00030DD1K,"My husband and I have been married for 25 years.

We've gone through counseling  -- together and separately. I've taught an in-depth Biblical marriage course twice. We've gone through some rough times. Very rough. The last decade of marriage has finally been one of growth and communication.

That said...the Love and Respect course has recently taught us much. You'd think there wouldn't be moments of severe cluelessness after all the years and stuff we've gone through. Ha!

This concept is so simple. But it's not a band-aid.

If you can afford it, if YOU want to do what you can to help your marriage - then buy this set.

I haven't read the book, but I know there is one available, as well as an audio version that would be cheaper. Way less expensive than a session with a counselor, or another steak dinner filled with arguing and strife.

This study is down-to-earth, even non-threatening. But it is convicting. If you aren't willing to make the changes you need to enrich your marriage, then don't buy this. But if you want to stop crashing your head into a brick wall over the same issues - and you want to be part of the solution - get your hands on this series.",1178150400,18,1174,4.535545023696683
2155661,5,B00030DD1K,"I went to the conference with my fiance. We bought a copy of the DVDs to share with our friends and family who might not make it to a conference. We figured it'd be worth the money if it helped just one couple's marriage, because there's really no price you can put on a happy marriage.

Several couples at the conference told us how lucky we were to get to hear this at the beginning of our life together instead of 10 or 20 years down the road.",1177804800,9,446,4.068181818181818
2155662,5,B00030DD1K,"My wife and I were encouraged to attend this class at our church for married couples.  We had no idea how great this class was going to be.  Everyone should take the time to see this seminar on DVD or go to it in person.  We have been blown away by all of the great information in it.

We both have friends who would not go to a church to attend a class like this.  So we have decided to buy this set and show it to as many of our friends as we can.

My wife and I can't stress enough how much this seminar would help anyones marriage/relationship!!!",1174262400,12,550,3.9545454545454546

Love and Respect is a great for revitalizing your relationship with your significant other. We highly recommend it.",1515456000,,304,4.846153846153846
8035701,4,B00030DD1K,"Been watching these DVD's with my husband and we are enjoying the series. There are lots of useful and practical examples of how to treat each other and we appreciate the humorous tone of the videos.  i have found there are a few old fashioned comments about male/female roles but its ok because like any other book, dvd or live conference, we take the material that applies to us and simply make note of the things that don't suit our relationship model. Overall, this was a good purchase and frankly, a good value for the money.",1512172800,2,530,4.520833333333333
