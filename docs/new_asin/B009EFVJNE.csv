8540588,5,B009EFVJNE,"I love showing this version of Death of a Salesman to my students.  Because it is a video of a stage version, the acting is a bit ""shouty"" as stage acting cannot give the nuances of film acting, but the performance by Brian Dennehy is very good.  I love seeing the stage machinery at work with the play and feel that the confined space is more effective than the roaming locations of film.  It is also fun to see Arthur Miller sitting in the audience!",1472947200,,451,4.2823529411764705
