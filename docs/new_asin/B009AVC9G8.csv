8538812,5,B009AVC9G8,"just watched this on the audience channel on directv. a very sad story of how the brooklyn nets built their barclay basketball arena and strong armed residents and businesses out to get their way. the system failed this neighborhood, badly. a well done, interesting and sad documentary.",1453334400,,286,5.1063829787234045
8538813,5,B009AVC9G8,"Interesting film. One man against the world of ""commercial real estate"" i.e. private property and its ""rights'. And the film makes it clear ""THE FIX IS IN"" when the powerful want what you own.
In the 1950's Walter O'Malley wanted the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues as the site for Dodger Stadium.
He lost that Battleground in Brooklyn..
(1000 Elysian Park Boulevard at Stadium Way in the city of Los Angeles was the winner of that contest.

Unsurprisingly, sixty years later, Atlantic and Flatbush is a professional sports venue.",1432252800,,544,5.044444444444444
8538814,5,B009AVC9G8,"This is an excellent documentary on the last holdout in the battle against New York's Brooklyn Atlantic Yards development, with much insight into how political forces cunningly manage to ride roughshod over neighborhoods and neighborhood constituencies.  For anyone involved in the fight against the ruthless overdevelopment of The Bloomberg Years in New York City, or interested in that ongoing history, this is necessary viewing.",1377129600,,431,5.734375
8538815,4,B009AVC9G8,"Sometimes winning doesn't mean getting the prize.  Sometimes winning means knowing that you fought for what's right.  This is a story that must be told again and again if anyone is to ever feel safe owning their own home.
  My only criticism is that in documentary format I personally prefer the style which has more sit down interviews with players in the story to narrate details of the events.
  There is a saying that goes something like this, ""The more enemies and the stronger they are, the more honor there is when you fight them.""  If that's true, then the focus of this story is about a very honorable family.  Shame on the rest of us for allowing this to happen.",1358380800,3,672,4.4958677685950414
8538816,5,B009AVC9G8,"This movie chronicles the Atlantic Yards debacle, which occurred in my Brooklyn neighborhood.  It covers something like eight years from proposal to groundbreaking on a project that was beyond a sweetheart deal, in which blocks of private housing was deemed ""blighted"" and basically given to a developer, played here by the evil Bruce Ratner. If you care about eminent domain abuse and the prevalence of backroom dealings among the powerful, where ever you live this is an important manual. See this movie!",1358294400,3,506,5.170731707317073
