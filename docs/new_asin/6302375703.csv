456184,5,6302375703,It brings back my childhood memories of pippi.  My three year old is nuts about her I think I can now go to Jeopardy and be tested on all the trivia.  I love pippi I now have all four movies thanks!,1318204800,2,198,3.8048780487804876

456186,5,6302375703,"I would highly recommend this movie. My 5 1/2 and 4 year old daughters love it as I did as a child. It is just pure silliness and has a great ""low budget"" early '70's look to it that I just love. My girls were not bothered by the dubbing at all, I just explained to them why the voices were like that. They should make more simple, fun movies that do not burden kids with all kinds of ""extra"" emotions and ""lessons"" that are not nessasary for movies to convey. Go Pippi!!",1228435200,14,471,4.075268817204301
456187,2,6302375703,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He loves Pippi but was disappointed with the film.  It was confusing to him because the dubbing was not in sync with the movement of the lips of the actors. I think it is difficult for children to understand the language conversion process.  It is an enjoyable film but not anything to get real excited about.,1169164800,5,364,4.484848484848484
