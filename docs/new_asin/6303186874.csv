602774,5,6303186874,"No need to repeat what the others had said,..but the show was just so darn well made that it was often the small touches that made it a classic and deserving of such high praise. Parts where it actually shows Rockford looking down before he backs down a car transporter and following the nice camera shot taken from the rear and bottom of the car as opposed to typical boring camera angles. Stuff like unique camera angles often goes unnoticed, but really it does add alot. They always tried to add realism in backgrounds, secondary props, people and scenes and that really pulls this away from the myriad of other cookie cutter shows from that era.

It would have been cool to have the interview with Garner outside on the exact beach sitting on a lounge chair as:

1) that would have tied it all in better

2) he probably would have looked better, more relaxed and less pasty and stiff.

the studio interview looked uncomfortable and the lighting was bad for his aging face.

Now as for the disc: I could not get ""Claire"" (from disc 3) to play at all on any of my 3 players (all newer) and that just ticks me off!!!",1082246400,,1117,4.402912621359223
602775,5,6303186874,"""The Rockford Files"" is one of the best detective shows ever.  James Garner is a tremendous actor as is Stuart Margolin, Joe Santos and the late Noah Beery, Jr., including every other actor connected with the show.  Top drawer writing, producing, directing & guest stars were the norm also.  Given that commercial television completely butchers these timeless episodes no matter the channel they air on, I'm living for the day when I can enjoy whichever great Rockford episode I want whenever I want.  PLEASE Universal--give us fans what we want!!!",1078790400,18,548,5.055555555555555
602776,5,6303186874,"The Rockford Files in my opinion was the best TV series ever, and without a doubt was definitely the best TV detective series.
From his trailer office to his home made business card printer, Rockford was truly unconventional. That is what set him apart from his other 70's detective peers. The best part about Rockford was that he was human. He was frequently wrong in his assumptions, he got beat up a lot, and unlike other macho types, he didn't always get ""the girl."" Angel played by Stuart Margolin added hilarity to the show, and Rockford's dad, played by Noah Beery, gave it a nice family feeling as well. Overall, this was simply an outstanding show, and compared to some of the shows from the 1970's that are already out on DVD, it really makes no sense that this show is not yet out on DVD, and I look forward to the day when The Rockford Files is finally out in DVD format in all 6 of its wonderful seasons.",1078358400,182,917,4.4
602777,5,6303186874,"It is long over due that Universal releases this show on DVD. Every episode is truly a work of art, a standard rarely maintained over the course of a six season run. And I know that I'm not alone in saying that Jim Rockford is the greatest tv detective of all-time, TV Guide said the same thing several years ago. When you consider all of the shows that are terrible and only lasted for a season or two, and are on DVD, you really have to wonder why The Rockford Files isn't on DVD already. My only question is: Universal, what's the hold-up? It's the best detective show ever and was a solid hit for its entire run, not to mention its success in syndication. It wasn't your typical detective show, and it wasn't your formulaic Dragnet or Law and Order type of show either. It had top notch acting, great writing, great stories, and a blend of drama, action, and comedy that you just don't see anymore. More importantly, the characters were flawed, but that's what made them so interesting. They were real, and on some level you can relate to all of them, and they were all portrayed beautifully by the extraordinary cast. My only hope is that they release all 6 seasons on DVD!",1074729600,22,1178,4.433179723502304
602778,2,6303186874,"The ""Rockford Files"" is beyond any shadow of a doubt one of my favorite television shows, and brings back precious memories of childhood, when life was far simpler (and better?). There were some excellent, excellent episodes, and some episodes where the writers must have worn their ""stupid hat."" ""BOTL"" is just such an episode.
  Jim Rockford discovers a sinister plot to murder Lindsey Wagner's father after being informed that a wealth widow is paying for her brother's (Bill Mummy, of ""Lost In Space"" and ""The Twilight Zone?"") medical school education. The only trouble is, it never gets explained what this has to do with it. Jim discovers that Wagner bounces a cheque to him, yet continues to work for her, out of the goodness of his heart? When we eventually wind up in the Nevada desert, Jim is chasing William Smith (later of ""Hawaii Five-O"" fame), when previously he wanted to get out of Smith's apartment before he recovered from a Mickey Finn? To get more speed, Jim downshifts on his trademark Pontiac Firebird. Only trouble is, the car's an automatic! Would the FAA really allow William Smith to keep an airplane in the middle of the Nevada desert? And finally, does anybody really believe that pop gun could bring down a Cessna 172?",1043452800,6,1247,4.822429906542056
602779,4,6303186874,"This episode of ""The Rockford Files"" was originally cast as the prime time ""pilot"" for the series.  Although some of the details had yet to be worked out,  it was (and still is) truly remarkable TV. This is from what I call the ""best of TV"" and James Garner is an actor without peer.  The storyline was way ahead of anything else in its day,  and Garner was the only one who could pull it off.  Couple this with a talented (and very young) Lindsay Wagner and you have a recipe for success. Definately worth buying/watching as are the rest of the series tapes.  It's easy to see why Garner and Co. had such a hot commodity in the '70s with this one.",978220800,28,648,4.227642276422764

Episodes 6 & 7 on disc one (This Case Is Closed, Parts I & II) have serious hang-ups. On the first set they were unwatchable, the disc would freeze and the only way to even get it out of the machine was to power down and restart. The second set has some short hang-ups and skipping, but is at least playable. Disc 2 has 2 unplayable episodes. Other seasons are on single-sided discs and don't have this problem.

However, I do remember really liking The RFs.  But this time around, although I still like them, the ever-present car chases (fast, slow, & otherwise)  have gotten a little tiresome, for me anyway!  It is still a really good series, but probably after once through them all, they will probably go to HPB. But I'm not sorry I  got them.  Jim Rockford is certainly likable!...I miss James Garner...RIP...
In comparison, I LOVED ""Brisco County Junior""!  I was so disappointed that it got axed after only one season.  There were some weak spots in it, especially the final episode, but at the time, they didn't know it  would be the final one.  I will be watching that series more than once.

On Disc 3, Roundabout plays halfway through and freezes. And yes I have upgraded many dvd players and blu ray players since then, and still have issues with this.

It most certainly lead him to the role in The Rockford Files tv series. It also brought him back to Malibu.
 The Rockford Files began with the pilot episode (not in this DVD set), ""Backlash of the Hunter"", March 27, 1974. James Garner played ""Private Investigator, Jim Rockford"". NBC picked it up as a tv series, The Rockford Files (1974-80) and it began September 13, 1974. It lasted for 6 seasons.

In the first season, Noah Berry Jr played the father ""Joseph ""Rocky"", Rockford"". Joe Santos as ""Sergeant Dennis Becker"", Gretchen Corbett as ""Attorney Beth Davenport"".
 Luis Delgado would play ""Officer Billings"", but in the first season played various roles; a taco stand or hot dog stand counterman or driver of a red convertible.
Stuart Margolin appears in episodes 16 & 20 as ""Angel"". We remember Stuart from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-American-Style-Season-1-Vol-1/dp/B000UX6TJ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love American Style - Season 1, Vol. 1</a>.
 Jack Garner (Jim's brother) would play various roles.

This Season One set does not include the pilot episode, but begins with episode one, ""The Kirkoff Case"". Total of 22 episodes. Episode 6 was originally a 90-minute episode.

The beginning of each start tag included mostly a new telephone message each week.

603232,5,6303186874,"I am one of the big fans of James Garner who entertained fans much of his career through his fine acting in movies and television. Rockford Files is masterpiece and the first season is one the best of the series. There are 23 episodes of the first season and Garner stars as the offbeat Jim Rockford, the private-investigator who does not use violence, but uses friendly conversation to solve some of the most difficult circumstances in his television life. He runs his business from a mobile home on the beach in Malibu, California with his father. He chases bad guys in his Pontiac Firebird on the streets and highways of Los Angeles. Several future stars of television guest in the first season and they include Lindsay Wagner, James Woods, Abe Vigoda, Suzanne Somers and Ned Beatty. This is an excellent addition to your library and to remember James Garner! He was not only a great actor but also a war hero. He was awarded Purple Heart twice for his heroic efforts in Korean War. James Garner is sorely missed. James Garner R.I.P.",1409788800,,1036,4.697802197802198

Rockford made it so Tom Selleck could go prancing around Hawai'i as Magnum, P.I.  The was a private investigator you just wanted to watch to see what he got mixed up in.  This was great television from a very well respected screen actor.",1406678400,,436,4.538461538461538

Garner playing more for angles and intellect then muscle with a light comic touch. Helped tremendously by Stuart Margolin as a side kick and Noah Beery, Jr.  who delightfully plays Garner's father. Great show and the personalities are never tiresome.",1404259200,,446,5.027027027027027

603465,5,6303186874,"The Rockford Files is such a special blend of detective show but manages to involve characters we care about. Jim and Rocky and their relationship is bumpy but so loving that it's cooperative and unbreakable. Meanwhile, there's Dennis, the police Lt.  who is Jim's best friend and partner of sorts in the pursuit of the bad guys. All the while, a tough match, with Jim seeking,shall we say ""extra effort"" that makes Dennis cringe a bit. The best episodes for me involve Beth Davenport and Angel. They really add the ""wow factor"" and bring out the best in Garner, amidst his prerequisite car chases and being roughed up by the goons of the week. If one compares other detective shows of the era, ""Kojak"" for instance, ""The Rockford Files"" has a lighter feel, not such a harsh realism in the crime genre, that makes it more fun and relaxing. A delicate and special blend. As for the Season One set, three two-sided discs, each in their own slim plastic case. The pluses: Excellent picture and sound. I watch them on a Sony bluray player with great results overall. Extras? I love that there is scene selection, plus a written synopsis and original air date listings when the episode is selected. The only bonus item is a brief interview with James Garner. I have read a few reviewers mention disc-playing issues. I did notice a few curious moments. Not sure if done intentionally in the original production of the show as visual effects, or little DVD glitches. On a few early episodes, a few scenes sported what I can only describe as ""stop-motion"" rather than smooth camera motion. Not a major issue, but peculiar. I wonder if other folks have had the same limited experience. This could be a bluray player mis-compatibility and nothing else. I have found that while DVD's CAN play in bluray players, there can be hiccups. Bluray shows play flawlessly though. You know the show, you'll love this set! Let the cast and great guest stars entertain you! Enjoyable and excellent TV. One of a kind!",1379203200,4,1993,4.710601719197708

603516,4,6303186874,Growing up I hated this show. My father dominated the TV set so when it came on I had to watch it. I hated it. I thought it looked dated and grungy back then too. Well I decided to watch it now after all of these years. And it was a decent show. Kinda funny. This review kinda sums up the entire series for me. I don't know if they did some filming tricks or what but that trailer sure did look nice on in the inside. I loved those plantation shutters. :-) The outside looked like a wreck. The one thing that this show taught me is . . . America is too big for its britches now . . . you will never see or hardly know a down on his luck man's man show like this again. But then again . . . he lived in a trailer with ocean front view in Santa Monica. LOL Look at that place now. Anyway it was a good trip back. Decent plots.,1373068800,3,824,3.76878612716763
603517,3,6303186874,My father was big fan of this show and I was happy to find it on here on dvd. I wish I had read more of the reviews because I might not have bought it. We have only viewed one disc so far but there is issues with the disc freezing when playing episodes. I was able to get an episode to play by choosing the scene selection and skipping the opening sequence. I'm kind of disappointed in amazon because I see reviews stating the same problems from years back and you would think they would stop selling the set or try to rectify the problem. The upside is that it plays fine on another dvd player in the home which makes no sense at all. I'm thinking it's the dual disc format.,1371600000,5,675,4.082706766917293

Noah Beery, as Rocky, is good to watch as well.  I've readthat Garner id most of his own stunts, which makes the series even more fun to watch.  My only question is, ""How did that Pontiac Firebird remain pristine after all it went through?""",1369180800,2,375,4.470588235294118
603519,5,6303186874,It is wonderful that someone thought to preserve this great TV program for revisiting during a time when the quality of TV has fallen so low.  It is nice to watch a TV show that does not display the social failings or positions of the ever changing society.  It is also great to watch entertainment that does not rely on blood spatter or gore to get your attention.  It is great that this show appeals to your intelligence and is not filled with shock and awe.  I collected the entire set and will enjoy revisiting the GREATER DAYS of TV.

Co-star his Pontiac Firebird Classic Sports Car, {The Rockfordmobile}, that out-ran all the baddies. His Texas characters, printing press, and routines are classics!

Season 4: 21 mostly great eps including 14 Classics! Season 5: 22 mostly great eps only 6 Classics though, Season 6 was a HALF SEASON CRAPPY 12 eps NOT UP TO James Garner's standard, only 2 were any good, which is partly why the show was cancelled. I DID NOT BUY SEASON 6!!!

SEASON 4 IS BY FAR THE BEST SEASON 14 / 21 eps = 67% CLASSICS!!!

If Universal would release the 2nd DVD of Rockfird Files 1990s Movies.....

If WB would just release Bret Maverick The Lazy Ace (1980) the world would be a better place.",1332201600,6,1417,4.656

If you don't like where the punch and the sound are a little off, or how they made tv shows in the time they were in than this isn't your series. Not much to say other than this, as you'll have to be the judge of if you like it or not. I know I'll be sad once we get done with the last season.",1328313600,2,508,3.80188679245283

Two major mistakes, first the pilot movie was not included, and second, in one particular episode you can see his trademark Firebird change from first season year i.e. '74 to the '77 Firebird, frontend similar to the Bandit's car. This is just sloppy editing, I'm sure for their age these episodes shouldn't be that hard to restore.

Great lines, interesting characters and best of all, there's Rockford who's slick, witty, cool and only Human. He has a realistic approach when dealing with cases and can solve them without being a superhero. You will get hooked on the first season! J. Rockford's cigarette tactic is very funny. If you missed the show the first time around or missed many episode's as I did, now is the time to catch up! The show still competes with the newer Detective/crime series with the only difference being modern equipment and better effects. Have fun!",1295481600,4,692,4.823529411764706

Sound and video are good, but several episodes on disc one would freeze up.  Disc 2 only had a few episodes that would play all the way through.  Disc 3 is fine.  Checking on other DVD players, I had the same freezes in the same places.  Clearly a problem with the discs.

I'm not able to return the set since it was a gift, but even if I could, given the reviews here I doubt I'd get a set where all episodes would play.  Maybe if you buy several sets you can end up with playable versions of all the episodes.  Buyer beware.",1295222400,8,712,4.0285714285714285

Amazon does not treat their customers right. So anyway good luck with your discs. Mine did play just fine and I archived them at once. I hope you think about that too, keep playing them and then they are ruined. Maybe you got lots of money, I am on veterans disability and do not.
Anyway if my backups get bad, and they generally do not, then I back them up again. Put the masters as I call em back on my shelf. I have over 650 movies and many box sets. I pay much (extra) to have them mailed over here, and sometimes the Thais VAT catches me and that really hurts. Trying to understand what triggers that? Think I need to order just two or three only at one time? This time was four movies one being box set.

603711,5,6303186874,"Replacing the original ""Rocky Rockford"" (Garner's dad) with Noah Beery was supremely perfect.  The Garner-Beery chemistry was so strong it humanized the entire ROCKFORD FILES series for years.

This was an even smarter move than replacing William Holden as the TV PERRY MASON (Holden apparently backed out early) with Raymond Burr; or dumping Jeff Hunter (Capt. Chris. Pike; Hunter's wife was getting in Roddenberry's face according to some reports) in favor of William Shatner (Capt. James Kirk) to run The Enterprise, and of course putting Leonard Nimoy into the Spock role instead of Martin Landau (backing out was apparently Landau's choice) in the original STAR TREK series.

BEST RE-CASTING MOVES APART FROM ROCKFORD FILES:  Putting THE AVENGERS' Emma Peel in to replace Honor Blackman who left to play Pussy Galore in GOLDFINGER is a close senond.

603754,4,6303186874,"""The Rockford Files"" is that rarest of artistic animals, offering in equal parts sublime entertainment and anagogic profundity.  It is also one of the 20th century premier textbooks on the art of acting.  It is for an actor what Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, or to Clementi's Opus 36 Sonatinas are to pianists.

Certainly, there are better actors than James Garner, Stuart Margolin, and Noah Beery individually, but it would be the rare piece of television drama that could offer such an embarrassment of riches in combination, or convey such a sense of even-handed collaboration.  Garner is the ""star"" of the series, but his persona is so bland in comparison with the others on the show that he often melds into the scenery; it is acting as the art of reacting.  Garner's skill in this respect is at its zenith when he is opposite Noah Beery.  When these two are  on-set together, it's easy to forget that you are watching ""acting"", and not a real father-and-son relationship.

A further beauty of the show's casting is that, oftentimes, the ""villain"", or antagonist on the show, will be an actor who is clearly chewing the scenery - that is, over-doing his part.  A perfect example of this is Rene Auberjonois (you may know him from other television roles) as a rock and roll journalist, full of himself, cocaine, and the 1972 Jaguar XJ-6 he drives around (and eventually crashes, pursued  by Rockford in his trusty Firebird).  A further, particularly luminous example, would be that of Roger Moseley as ""Electric Larry"", the money-laundering pimp who tries to out-game Rockford and Angel over a suitcase of FBI-marked cash.  Other no less worthy types of this kind are William Daniels as the high-handed federal prosecutor, and Tom Selleck as the overly-perfect Lance White (a sort of anti-Rockford), complete with a white Cadillac DeVille rag-top.

Lance White's car brings me to another virtue of the show -- even the cars are characterizations.  Think of Beth Davenport's Porsche Targa (later upgraded to a Mercedes SEL pop-top coupe); the ultimate yuppie lawyer mobile.  Think of Rocky's GM Truck -- the handyman special, American, workaday, solid (like Rocky himself).  Then there's Jim's Firebird, and Garner's sure handling thereof. There is even a move called ""The Rockford"" (it might once have been known as a ""moonshiner's turn"") which I associate entirely with this show. Pull out in reverse, at high speed, then heave the wheel over so the car does a 180-degree turn. In the midst of the turn, shift into ""D"" so that by the time the ends are switched, the car is ready for a full forward sprint, and the rearward momentum is now used to assist forward movement. It's stunt-driving as ballet, and apparently a move Garner himself could execute -- along with most of the show's other stunts.

A few more notes:

Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin. The alternating cowardice and grandiosity; the vaccilation between wheedling and self-conveniencing honesty and an equally self-serving prevarication. And the physicality of the actor himself -- the creepy beard, the cheap trousers and white golf-shoes, his entire persona screams ""sleazebag,"" but yet and still; he lightens every episode he's in (particularly the resplendent ""Dirty Money, Black Light"", also directed by Margolin). You realize just how deeply this character was conceived -- that is, how far back in time Cannell, Margolin, et al. reached for his type -- when they have him quoting Shylock (""If you prick me, do I not bleed?"") in one episode, and then Cain in another: ""Am I my brother's keeper?"" What's even more brilliant is that both of those lines play as moments of gentle comedy, and not as what they really are: profound examinations of modern conscience.

But there's something else about this show that might have missed some viewers. If Rockford is the modern Everyman, then his conviction and pardon function metaphors for Original Sin and Redemption. He is like all of us -- convicted by the devil, but pardoned by God. The metaphor is strengthened by Rockford's own stability, his own keeping to a steady way. It's always ""200 dollars a day, plus expenses""; he always keeps his gun in the cookie jar; he always lives in the trailer at Paradise Cove; he fishes with his father off the Santa Monica pier. Rockford's stability -- and this metaphor of original sin -- are constantly tested by, or juxtaposed with, the madness of a world unravelling about him.

The excesses of the 70s (and not just those of sex or drugs, but also authority) play as garish in comparison to Rockford's drab exterior. Rockford, the Oklahoman, is out of place in California. He lives on its very edge, but only because to live in its midst would be to partake too much of its strangeness, and perhaps thereby, to risk that unearned redemption.",1263600000,11,4799,4.937888198757764

603758,4,6303186874,"This 1974-75 Season of this detective drama series is the season that started it all and brings me all the way back to memory lane to when I used to watch THE ROCKFORD FILES every Friday night during it's whole 6-year run from 1974 thru 1980 on NBC.

Jim Rockford(James Garner)was a MANNIX-like private detective who was a pardoned ex-con and Vietnam veteran now turned private-eye who lived on a shoe-string budget, got snookered by clients, got his ass kicked by bigots every other week, often got burglarized, frequently got robbed, & often got his bronze Pontiac Firebird racked up a lot too especially since the often fastidious Rockford was always getting himself into mischief by snooping around and sometimes did a little bit of hanky-panky trying to find leads and clues to his investigations, but one of the intriguing things I found about THE ROCKFORD FILES was I cant help finding it kind of amazing how Rockford was always able to make ends meet & still manage to live in a gorgeous area, wear spiffy 3-piece suits, and afford a hot muscle car since Rockford was barely able to make a living on his very skimpy budget just like Mannix(Mike Connors), Magnum(Tom Selleck), and Rick & A.J. Simon(Gerald McRaney, Jameson Parker)all did, especially since this show often pointed out what a laugh Rockford's cash-flow problem was, despite the fact that Rockford charged his clients $200 a day, plus expenses just like the Simon Bros. charged their clients $400 a day, plus expenses.

Rockford also lived an eccentric lifestyle like Rick and AJ did too since Rockford lived in a rusty trailer in a parking lot by Malibu Beach & always put his gun in a cookie-jar just like Rick lived lived on a boat in the backyard of his baby-brother AJ's house which was actually filmed in Venice, not San Diego.

Therefore, you could say that THE ROCKFORD FILES was like a poor-mans MAGNUM, especially since the often fastidious(Jim Rockford)was a lot like the Hawaiian beach-bum private detective(Thomas Magnum)in many ways since Rockford was always broke and in debt just like Magnum's was, except Magnum got to live a private-eyes fantasy kind of lifestyle since Magnum lived rent-free and often had unlimited use of Robin Masters' Ferrari, and worked only when he wanted to, unlike most gumshoes.

Additionally, even though Rockford was a bachelor who didn't have a nice home or steady income to fall back on, Rockford seemed to have a lot of talent and seemed to be quite popular with the ladies kind of like Magnum(Tom Selleck) and Houston(Lee Horsley)were.

In addition to that, Rockford would always have a different message on his answering machine at the beginning of each episode before the introduction would start, but most of Rockford's messages left on his answering machine at the beginning of each episode were bad news, but I used to get a kick out of them along with the fact that Rockford had an answering machine taking calls from potential clients at his trailer instead of having a leggy secretary answering his calls like a typical private-eye show did.

Rockford also had a sleazy ex-con buddy Angel Martin(Stuart Margolin) who often got him into hot water and a drop-dead gorgeous attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett)bailing him out of jail, plus Rockford had his often agitated police investigator buddy Sgt. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD whom Rockford had a love/hate relationship with, but would sometimes feed classified information to Rockford to help him solve his cases despite the fact that it often put Becker on a back-burner with his overzealous superior officers Lt. Diehl(Tom Atkins)and Lt. Chapman(James Luisi)who detested Rockford immensely and would always look for any excuse they could find to arrest Rockford and get his PI license revoked just like Rick & A.J. Simon had their cop buddies from San Diego P.D. such as the street-savvy police Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid) and the foxy Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)to help Rick(Gerald McRaney) and A.J.(Jameson Parker) solve cases on the detective drama SIMON & SIMON.

Rockford also had kind of a strange relationship with his long-time suffering retired truckdriver father Joseph ""Rocky"" Rockford(Noah Beery, Jr.)who often argued with Rockford about his lifestyle and occupation about being a private investigator and would always try to encourage Rockford to get into the trucking business instead along with the fact that this show was still in its honeymoon phase when this private detective drama made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1974, but this show got even better when it hit its 2nd Season, which was when THE ROCKFORD FILES really started to hit its stride since Rockford's 1975-76 Season was the season when this show was starting to walk since this was the season when this show just started to crawl along with the fact that this was one of the better years for this show when Rockford was in its honeymoon phase of the series.

In this season of Rockford, it was also interesting seeing guest stars like

It was also cool being able to watch every episode of Rockford complete & uncut like they were all originally shown on their original air-dates on NBC with the exception of being commercial-free on the DVD box sets as opposed to watching them in reruns with too many deleted scenes & too many commercial interruptions like they were shown on A&E, TNN, TV Land, WGN, and MeTV.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when I was only 2 years old and was living in the Imperial Valley for the very first time along with the fact that I was raised in El Centro, CA, which by the way is an intensely hot and ultimately boring place.

In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 out on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and Shout will be releasing SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010 and are both available for pre-order and give us 2 private detective dramas in the works to look forward to in the Spring of 2010.",1233273600,2,9900,5.001217285453439

603844,5,6303186874,"First aired in 1974, ""The Rockford Files"" is one of the most enduring shows ever on television. The series is intelligently written, thought provoking, funny, and exciting simultaneously. Needless to say, much of the credit goes to the onscreen charisma of James Garner, but the other elements in the series compliment Garner so well as to make a near-perfect viewing experience. The concept of a smart ex-convict Private Investigator works here because of an interesting dynamic and duality of character: Rockford is a genuinely good person, but can be very sneaky when needed.

The first season contains 23 episodes, most with great guest stars such as James Woods, Lindsay Wagner, Abe Vigoda, and Ned Beatty. Even relatively small parts are superbly cast (watch especially for the entertaining episode where Gordon Jump plays Jim's longsuffering auto body shop repairman and used car dealer), while series regulars like Joe Santos as police Sergeant Dennis Becker provide needed backstory while carrying on a love-hate relationship with Rockford. Noah Beery plays ""Rocky"", Jim's longsuffering father perfectly, and provides much of the comic relief the show is known for. Gretchen Corbett plays Jim's lawyer, Beth Davenport, who maintains a frustrating professional and personal relationship with Jim (although there are ambiguous romantic overtones), bailing him out of numerous jams. Toward the end of the first season the wonderful Stuart Margolin enters the cast as one of Jim's former prison buddies, now on parole and always looking for an angle.

Every detail of the show from the iconic Mike Post theme to the wonderful answering machine opening combine to provide a perfect window into 1970's television drama. Some people have reported problems with the DVD playback of this set, but I had no issues whatsoever. I also enjoyed the interview with James Garner greatly: his reflections on the series were both entertaining and insightful.

One of my favorite memories as a young boy was watching ""The Rockford Files"" with my Dad; this DVD set is great for reminiscing, but the show stands the test of time on its own.",1211760000,3,2128,5.216374269005848

Garner was chosen for this role because, essentially, it's a twentieth century update of Maverick. And since Maverick isn't available on DVD I console myself with this.

Rockford was as human as any character would be on TV in that era. He wasn't a tough guy but he didn't back down when cornered, even if he was outnumbered. But, like most of us, he would try to talk his way out of something, after all, discretion is the better part of valor. No, he didn't always get the girl, but he always got the criminal, mostly due to his dogged determination.

Sort of forgot about the show for a good 20 years until syndications came about here in Buffalo on local tv. As a 30 something, I have to say that season 1 is great from beginning to end. Most shows season 1's are weak due to ironing out personalities, etc. However, James Garner was tailor made for this role. The only disappointment was not having the pilot which came as a bonus on season 2. The best episode was the 2 part ""Profit and Loss"" episode. I grew up more on Magnum and Simon and Simon but seeing this show today makes me appreciate how great the show was when I was a toddler due to the ""vulnerability"" of Garner. He wasn't a rough and ready stud, he got his licks and was shortchanged by clients which is very realistic to what PI's deal with. I again remember the tail end in grade school tuning in to Dukes and seeing Rockford on commercials. If I could go back in time close to 30 years, I would've watched Rockford those friday nights in the late 70's.",1174262400,,1150,4.255707762557078
603899,4,6303186874,"One of the all-time classic detective shows. I used to watch re-runs of this show during my youth and thought Jim Rockford led a pretty good lifestyle, as he lived in a trailer home by the beach, drove a cool Pontiac Firebird and ran his own P.I. business (charging $200 a day plus expenses). The down side though was that he often received physical beatings and clients refused to pay him. We also never saw how much time he spent sitting in LA traffic.

'Jimbo' is a (pardoned) ex-con who just wants a bit of independence and some peace and quiet. Of course he doesn't get it. His closest friends are his dad, 'Rocky' and shifty ex-con Angel Martin (who doesn't appear until late in the season). Along the way he crosses paths with a number of pretty although not always honest women. Female guest stars include Suzanne Somers, Shelley Fabares and Lindsay Wagner. Look out for a young Gerald McRaney who plays a hotel desk clerk - he has an almost identical role in season two. By season's end, Jim's relationship with Detective Dennis Becker and the LAPD also gets much warmer.

Couldn't give this season one set five stars as it takes a few episodes for the show to really hit the mark. Some of the earliest episodes were a bit short on story and character development and instead relied a little too much on car chases. Picture quality is not quite perfect either as it flickers a little like a cinema screen. A bit disappointing that the pilot episode is not here. It instead appears as a bonus on the season two set. Also, while it's only a small thing, isn't there supposed to be a Universal MCA-TV closing title at the end of each episode? Like most Universal region 1 releases, it's not there.

Negatives aside, this show is lots of fun and a big thumbs up for the Mike Post theme. I'm now glued to the t.v. watching season two. By the way, if you like James Garner's laid back style and sense of humour here then you'll probably enjoy his older show Maverick and movies such as Support Your Local Sheriff.",1172275200,4,2016,4.487738419618529

There's been a few good ones - David Janssen as Harry O / Tom Selleck as Magnum PI/ William Conrad as Cannon and a few others whose names escape me right now.

But James Garner as the world-weary Jim Rockford was / is without a doubt the best.

And in common with every other great television show, it had a fantastic supporting cast - Sgt Becker / Beth Davenport / his dad, Rocky and, of course, Angel Martin. Has there ever been a sleazier character on TV..??

But I have to confess, the relationship I enjoyed the most was between Jim and Lt Chapman, Dennis Becker's boss. God, they were priceless exchanges which Jim ALWAYS won (nobody could turn a phrase as well as Jimbo.

mini-series like ""Winds of War."" Most of these have been via the Sunnyvale Public Library

which has a great collection of DVD sets, but also from purchases. In earlier days

I bought the whole Columbia House VHS catalog of 30 minute ""Gunsmoke"" episodes,

all the ""Have Gun Will Travel"" epsiodes, and, yes, all the ""Maverick"" episodes.

""Maverick"" of course is where James Garner launched his TV and film career, and ""The Rockford Files""

clearly is derived from ""Maverick."" It is amazing to me that Garner was

only 29 when ""Maverick"" was started, and that he could carry it in such

a unique direction. From the first episode (when I saw it as an adult) it was

obvious that he was going to be a major film star.

""Rockford"" is the best detective series ever, with a sense of humor and humanity that

that many of the major dramatic series wpuld be lucky to stumble into.

In short, ""Rockford"" is the best of all possible television worlds.

603977,5,6303186874,"I really liked this release.  Not much in the way of extras.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is some of the episodes are not in the best of shape and they were not cleaned up, ie removing white flecks, and items that transferred from original tape.  It appears the show was recorded on film, not video so it can be cleaned up.  Check out The Who-The Kids Are Alright to see how they cleaned up the master.  They did a fantastic job on that remaster.

Also their is one shot, in one of the episodes, where they inserted a stock shot of the 2nd car, grill is different (year of car is different).  They probably did this to cover a damaged piece of film.  They could have at least used the same car from the same year as the stock piece.  When I saw that I said ""Wait a minute that is not the same car, different year.""  As most of you know the car was changed after the first year, newer model, newer year, different grill.

603980,5,6303186874,"First a correction on one of the reviews below mentions that the interview with James Garner included here was done before he died in 2004. Mr. Garner will be surprised to learn he's dead since as of this writing he's very much alive. It's a great interview with Garner providing interesting insight into the show and how he became involved. He also comments about the shows themselves pointing out that he rarely remembered the episodes just the stunts he did for them since they could be pretty physically taxing. An exception to this rule is the terrific first episode of the first season.

This is a great first season for the show with top notch writing and performances. Guests during the first season include James Woods, Joseph Cotton, Suzanne Sommers, Lindsay Wagner and Roger Davis (""Alias Smith and Jones"")although the original pilot episode is missing as part of this set (it is included in season two). During the first season the show ranked in the top five in ratings and was #1 for its time slot. Later from season three onward the show received a slew of Emmy nominations including wins for Best Dramatic Episodes and an Emmy win for (long overdue) for James Garner.

The quality of the images are good overall. Colors have faded and there's a fair amount of dirt and debris (that probably could have been cleaned up during the digital mastering process)but otherwise looks good. Audio sounds fairly clean as well with dialogue coming across loud and clear.

Interestingly it appears as the syndicated version of at least two episodes are include--the two part (which, if I'm not mistaken ran originally as a two hour movie special originally)""The Case is Closed"". When this episode aired in syndication it was broken up into two separate episodes and had a couple of minutes added to pad out the running time. It's a terrific episode that could have done without the padding. Also, Lindsay Wagner reprises her role as Sara Butler in the episode ""Aura Lee, Farewell"". I would have loved to see her character appear from time-to-time but within a year of this she was doing ""The Bionic Woman"" spin-off.

The first season is a terrific one playing with the conventions of the mystery genre. Garner makes Rockford very real with his low key charm and humor. A great series that looks very good in this set. My two only complaints are a lack of additional extras and that these are dual sided discs other than than dual layered single sided discs which stand up to wear and tear better.",1153353600,4,2499,4.764434180138569

This is a well-produced set including a short interview with Jim Garner shortly before he died in 2004. Transfers are clean, the sound is excellent, and I experienced no technical issues with my DVD set. Enjoying a highly successful run during prime time in the 70's, the series was characterized by excellent acting not only with James Garner in the lead, but also with supporting players like Noah Berry Jr, Stuart Margolin, Joe Santos, among others. Loosely based on the character of private detective Phillip Marlowe, Garner was ideally cast.

Ex-con now turned private eye, Jim Rockford was a refreshing antithesis to Mickey Spillane's tough-guy Mike Hammer; Rockford is not a wimp, but would rather talk his way out of a fight if he could.  And that is part of his appeal: he is an ""Everyman""  who is, of course, flawed and not necessarily heroic, but principled where his clients and close friends are concerned.

The brainchild of Steven J. Cannell, this was the series that made him a household name for the popular television dramas produced during the 1970's.

The original smart-ass Private Investigator is finally out on DVD.

Co-starring  Joel Grey, James Woods, Jackie Cooper, Linda Evans, Pre-Barney Miller Abe Vigoda, pre-Charlies Angel Susan Sommers, pre-Starsky and Hutch Paul Micheal Glaser, and a pre-Simon&Simon Gerald McRaney; all make apearances in this first season.  So many of the best television actors of the day and future stars passed through the Rockford Files.

The interview with James Garner is very informative.  It's wonderful that they've produced this while Mr. Garner is still around to share his memories with us.  As a fan of the show, it is fun to find out things like who picked the brown Pontiac and why, how Angel Martin kept showing up, and it interesting to hear James Garner's first impressions of James Woods.  Missing is the pilot episode and the story behind Noah Berry's arrival as the replacement Rocky.

The art work is tasteful though the package itself is somewhat cheap; 3 double sided disks with no production notes and only the one bonus feature in the whole set.  But having the shows allows you to see how the show developed over its life time.  There were lots of long car chases and tailing in the first season, that feels like they were just killing time.  That is also explained in the James Garner interview.  It is also interesting to note the first introduction to some of the characters that Rockford gathers around him to run his own cons in later seasons.  Angel Martin's first car chase in the passenger seat of Rockford's car is, also, priceless!  ""Why do you live out here?"" ""I don't!""

Well worth having.",1141862400,7,1732,4.840136054421769
604057,4,6303186874,"I'm watching the first season of TRF episode by episode. Truly one of the all-time great series and I'm so excited to finally have the DVD collection available. But, like ""Moonlighting,"" these early episodes require some patience on the part of the viewer. The humor isn't consistent. Rocky isn't in enough. Dennis only pops up here and there and Angel is yet to come. We know the good stuff comes in the later seasons when all these great characters emerge on their own.

Thankfully, James Garner is such a great actor and Rockford is the character he was born to play. He carries us through even some of the lamer early episodes, like the one with Paul Michael Glaser doing a cheap Al Pacino and Joan Van Ark acting silly. Some of thes scripts have holes big enough to drive Rockford's trailer through.

Yet, it's so cool to see the Malibu of the mid-70s and all the great LA locations. You get a new respect for Garner the actor and the TON of work he had to do to carry this show. He's in every scene and multiple locations and some physical requirements. It's no wonder his body eventually gave out.

I'm just so happy to finally have these shows on DVD. Wish some of the other cast could be included in the interviews. Perhaps later on down the road.",1141257600,7,1256,4.452173913043478

604064,4,6303186874,"Arguably the last, great free TV detective series, the content of the first season of the ROCKFORD FILES ranges from pedestrian scripts (such as half-hour shows stretched to two-hours--replete with many repeats of the same scenes) to superior screen treatments loaded with suspense and multiple red herrings.  This classic 70's TV show is packed with humor, pretty good acting, great music, and imaginative car chases using what are now classic cars.  It's likely to bring tears to your eyes when you see these beauties being wrecked!  DVD audio quality is first rate making sound short-cuts taken by the original audio engineers (e.g., uneven sound mixing, canned sound effects, and little or no looping) jarring if not amusing (this was when TV speakers were usually smaller than your cell phone, so who could hear the difference?!).  Video quality is a mixed bag (when viewed at 720p).  Some shows are sharp and colorful; others suffer from color wash-out (especially episodes 7 [THIS CASE IS CLOSE PART I] and 8 [THIS CASE IS CLOSED PART II] and the last few episodes on the last disk).  Dirt is often to be seen, and grain is very noticeable in some episodes.  Obviously, the DVD producers went cheap and did not digitally remaster or do much (or anything) to clean up the source materials.  The disks themselves are poorly presented.  You need a jewelers eye piece to read which is side A (these are dual-sided disks with labeling confined to a few millimeter around the spindle hole), and side B is not labeled.  Tricky to handle when you are trying to keep finger prints off both reading surfaces.  There is no DVD booklet.  ""Extras"" consist of a short, rather depressing interview with the star (on the first disk).  To keep the fantasy alive and well, recommend skipping it.",1140220800,5,1784,4.867549668874172

Nobody could have played such a role to perfection other than James Garner.  Coming off playing 'Bret Maverick' and a dozen or more movie roles, he settled right into the character and established it almost instantly as a TV legend.  Great supporting cast (always loved that 'Rocky') and a breezy, easy going style that was so easy to watch.  I fondly recall watching this show as a young teenager (Friday nights at 7 PM), and its great catching up with it again after all these years.

604125,5,6303186874,"James Garner, this actor is the classiest and most realistic PI we came to know as Jim Rockford. The way he could capture the cast and create the very likeable character that was welcome in our living rooms for the better part of the seventies.

He was so believable as the always struggling to find the truth. He made us resolve that the only reason he investigated the case was because he cared, not so much about the victim, or the suspect, it was because no one else could solve it. He cared about doing something others had failed to do, or would fail to do. No one else was available or willing, so Jim got the call. He'll doing, he's not happy about it though, and it won't be cheap either, it's $200.00 a day...plus expenses!

Jim is not too cool, he's not too smart he's not too cocky, that makes him very real, and very believable. It makes the show very entertaining, even today, 31 years later. Jim never tried to be more than he could carry, just enough. Just enough of the real man (James Garner) to sell the character of Rockford. He let his co-stars shine too, he never stole the show, of showed them up, always giving them equal play time and play type. This made the whole chemistry of the show incredible, it made it last and no matter the story it was entertaining to watch.

I'm so glad I haven't been able to see these episodes in so long, it really makes watching this DVD now much more special. I'll take my time watching them, maybe one ever week to two weeks, maybe skipping some over summer, just to make it last, just to savor every scene, every interaction of characters.

Here in the UK, it was aired at about 6.00pm on BBC2 which made it a welcome relief from the two other channels that showed the post early evening news current-affairs programmes such as Nationwide and Today - yes we only had three TV channels until 1979.

My wife who was born more or less the same time the early series were originally aired sat through the pilot episode and immediately said what was on my mind. ""Life couldn't get much better than being in your 40s and living on the West Coast in the 1970s.""

Think about it $200 a day plus expenses, gas at 35c a gallon, no AIDS and having been just old enough to miss the 60s (god awful decade glamorised by the media).

Garner pitches the part perfectly. I would say that that like other Series One's, the characterisations aren't fully developed but the scripts are tightly drafted. As other reviewers have said, you can find yourself looking at the DVD clock during the car chases. The editing is cheap, I've seen the same stock shots in different episodes such as very strange ""moon in clouds"" every time Rockford blacks out. He also seems to be following a blue pick-up on the Coast Road driving right to left in more tha episode.

The woman all look boney thin with Karen Carpenter hairdoos and polyester pant suits. The thugs look like they've dropped out of a 16mm blue movie with their chiselled chins and bad rugs. Still this is how I remember it.

Jim Rockford proved to be a difficult character for James Garner to live down, as he played the free-wheeling private detective to a T. His disarming nature and the way the show captured the mid 70's have made it a classic, like the gold Pontiac Firebird he drove.  The series also became a frequent haunt for guest celebrities like James Wood and Abe Vigoda in the premier episode, The Kirkoff Case.

The picture is certainly better than you'll see with the dark WGN re-runs, but--if I'm going to be asked to spend the same amount of money as I would for DVDs of new shows like ""Sex and the City"" or ""Seinfeld""--I expect the producers to make a better effort to remove the blemishes from the film and touch up the color.  (I guess I'd have to compare the DVDs to the original reels to really know what they did, if anything.)

My first set of discs had some minor freezing on disc one, no problems on disc two, but serious issues with disc 3, with several episodes (""Claire"", ""Just By Accident"" and ""Roundabout"") being unplayable. A second set following a return exhibited exactly the same problems in exactly the same places, so now I am going to have to return that as well. My DVD player is a newish Panasonic, not a cheapy, and in any event my backup player, a cheap Citizen that is a few years old, exhibited the same problem. Given the comments of others having similar problems, I can only assume there is a bad batch of discs in the pipeline. This is totally unacceptable for Universal and I can only imagine how James Garner -- who had his own little war with Universal about the series after it ended -- must feel about their handling of it.

For what I could actually watch, the content is excellent. Prints are sharp, colors are good, and the sound is generally acceptable for a series of that era. The shows themselves are priceless. I particularly liked ""Aura Lee, Farewell"", with the lovely Lindsay Wagner guesting. But the quality problems with the discs really soured me on this set. Universal must do something about the quality of their DVDs, and hopefully the folks at Amazon and other large retailers who will have to deal with unhappy customers will be able to exert some influence to get them to clean up their act.",1136678400,28,1683,4.569536423841059
604167,5,6303186874,"When I first learned that new and old TV series were making their way to DVd season by season, one of the first series I thought about was The Rockford Files. Three years later, my wish is finally granted as Universal releases the first season of this classic `70's P.I. show.

James Garner plays Jim Rockford, an average, blue-collar guy who just happens to be a P.I. Jim was a guy who was screwed by the system, imprisoned for a crime for which he was later given a full pardon. In the best tradition of classic crime fighters, he seems to be working against both sides of the system as he brings down extortionists, murderers, mobsters and thugs, all while defending the little guy. Yet, he takes no guff from the cops, who usually love to brush him off and throw his criminal record in his face as he gets too close to the truth. Rockford is non-conventional in his methods, resorting more to brain power and street smarts, rather than his fists or a gun. In fact, he usually comes out on the losing end in most of the physical altercations with an assorted array of tough guys. Yet, he somehow manages to prevail and catch the killers, even though he's not as successful at making his clients pay his expenses.

The first season isn't without its problems. Car chases were a fixture in the `70's and early `80's, but some of these sequences run for over 10 minutes and they grow tiresome. James Garner explains this in his interview, saying that the violence had to be watered down because of the early hour during which Rockford aired, so gunfights were replaced with car chases and the occasional brawl. James Garner loved to drive, but the chases do get old after a few episodes. Luckily, fewer car stunts were used in later seasons of this show. The Rockford Files was blessed with a supporting cast that proves that a leading man as only as good as those who surround him. Joe Santos, Gretchen Corbett and Stuart Margolin all deserve accolades for their portrayals In this show. Unfortunately, with the exception of Noah Beery as Rockford's gold-hearted but over-bearing father Rocky, you don't see as much of the other supporting characters as you will in subsequent seasons. Still, the plots are smart, the dialogue sharp and clever for the time and the pay-offs were usually believable.

I must add my voice to those who blast Universal for excluding the pilot that launched the series. My suspicion is that they will include the pilot in the abridged sixth and final season of Rockford, since it consists of only 10 regular episodes. I am also frustrated that they used the syndicated version of, ""This Case Is Closed,"" that was chopped into two parts, rather than giving us the 90-minute broadcast version. I was able to play these discs straight through with no freezing on my normal DVd player, but the discs skip and freeze a good deal in my portable player. The previews with no skip option and too few chapter breaks are also a nitpick on my list. These complaints should rate the absence of a star, but truthfully, I'm so glad to finally have this series on DVD that I'll overlook it for now. But Universal had best pay attention and address these problems with future releases.",1136678400,2,3199,4.638447971781305

They all played through perfectly, and the picture for the most part looks crystal clear, or at least as good as you'd reasonably expect 30 year old film to look.  There may indeed be a bad batch of DVDs out there; mine wasn't one of them.

I should take a star off for the exclusion of the pilot episode.  That makes no sense.  Fortunately I bought it on VHS a few years ago, so I'll live.  But I don't know what Universal was thinking.  Idiots.  But I had been waiting for so long for this show to be announced, and then another eternity for the release date to arrive, that I can't possibly rate it anything less than five stars.",1136592000,2,780,4.361111111111111
604169,5,6303186874,"I was a child in Los Angeles in the 70's, and I remember watching and loving this show.  James Garner is a fantastic actor and James Rockford is the true, sarcastic P.I. The Rockford character, in my view, is perfectly modeled after another great P.I. by the name of Philip Marlowe (By Raymond Chandler).  He's a tough talking, down to earth, sarcastic son of a gun that treats the world as it should be treated, with a cynical viewpoint.  I would certainly recommend Season 1, as it is one of the best of the entire series.  Not having the Pilot Episode on this set is extremely disappointing, and quite honestly surprising, considering that the Pilot is always thrown in on a TV to DVD series.  I do disagree with another poster in saying the the Pilot was not good, in fact, I found it to be excellent and even showed an almost harder edged Rockford than what he ended up being in Season 1, if that's possible.  Even if someone doesn't like the Pilot, I would think that it would be interesting to watch, if for nothing else, to see a different actor playing Rocky (good choice in changing this) and sideburns that almost encompassed Garner's entire face.  I enjoyed the Pilot, and it's ashame that it's not here.
Another thing is that Lindsay Wagner is in the Pilot, and her character returns later in Season 1 in an episode called, Aura Lee, Farewell, that pretty much continues that relationship.  There are references throughout this episode to their past case (the Pilot), which would have helped the viewer get where these two were coming from.  You can get the Pilot on Season 1 in the UK (as another poster noted), if you have an all region DVD player.  I just might end up doing this.

As far as the technical aspect of this set skipping and freezing, I had absolutely no problem whatsoever.  I watched the entire series all the way through and it didn't freeze once or skip once.  After reading some these reviews, I count myself fortunate.  To back some of those up though, Universal does not seem to do a great job on some of their sets.  I have the Miami Vice Season 1 set and it does freeze and skip, so it is a legitimate beef.  I do love how in the description above under DVD Features in Product Details how it mentions ""James GARDNER"" talking about the Rockford Files.  Too bad they couldn't get James Garner.

If you want to watch a great bit of classic tv, where you can actually watch 50 minutes worth of show, when there was only 10 minutes of commercials, unlike now, where you're lucky if you get 38 minutes of show out of an hour series, and you like a sarcastic and quick dialogue, this is for you.",1136160000,9,2627,4.448851774530271

For cinephiles out there ignorant of the James Garner vehicle, imagine if Robert Altman had expanded The Long Goodbye into a television series, and you generally get the idea of what you get with The Rockford Files.

The first season was a bit of rocky start to be honest.  It's still a great show, but the editing isn't quite as tight as later years.  They try hard early on to play up romantic angles for Jim Rockford.  Car chase sequences run a little too long sometimes, but that's unsurprising seeing as Stephen Cannel was the series creator.  The show actually got better as he eased his grip on it.

Finally, regarding the missing pilot...the pilot stinks.  I've seen it a couple times.  The guy playing Rocky is different, the tone is off, etc.  It bares little resemblence to what the show would eventually become beyond the premise.  Even Jim is a little tougher and more romantically inclined.  I understand how hardcore fans would be upset by the absence of the pilot, but I can honestly say having seen the pilot on multiple occasions, nothing is lost.

604212,2,6303186874,"I've been waiting for this show's DVD debut for years, and, despite the unimaginitive layout and appearance of the discs themselves, I must say that there is only one intentional feature (excluding any glitches others have noted) here that the pilot episode, ""Backlash of the Hunter,"" was not included. I don't know how often pilots are excluded from first season DVD sets, but this is the first time one has been missing from any I have ever purchased, and I can discern no logical reason for its exclusion. It could always be included in later seasons, and I desperately hope it will be, but it *should* have been in this one, and the fact that it is not is not only disappointing, but also troubling for the quality of future Rockford releases.

As much as I love this show, the exclusion of an entire episode from the season this set claims to have collected in full constrains me from giving more than two stars. Considering how long we've all waited, you'd think Universal would have cared enough to sell us a complete product.",1135555200,11,1033,4.644808743169399
604213,5,6303186874,"I don't know how I missed the Rockford Files on TV, but I did. I purchased Season One as a blind buy. I was a fan of Magnum, P.I. and I like detective shows, so I decided to give the Rockford Files a chance. For about thirty bucks, The Rockford Files is not an expensive set (compare to other series that are twice as much for less episodes). So far I have watched 4 episodes and am very happy with the purchase.

The picture quality is much better than I expected for a series from the 1970's. I have a large DVD collection, and the Rockford files is better than some DVD's from series in the 80's. This is not HDTV or even close to it, but the picture is clear. In some very bright scenes, a little grain can be seen. But overall, the picture quality is excellent.

The Rockford Files is unexpectedly funny at times. James Garner is under rated as a comic. While the Rockford Files is a detective series, I find myself laughing often, sometimes laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes.

James Garner has a very brief interview as a bonus in the DVD set, it is under ten minutes. He fondly talks about the series, the cast, and the firebird. It would have been nice to have commentary on an episode, but I am happy just getting the episodes. I should note, the first four episodes are all 50 minutes long, which makes me believe we are getting the full episodes, and not the syndicated, cut down to make room for more commercial episodes.

I'll end with a message to Universal. I hope you have plans to release season two soon. I am watching at the pace of about an episode every other day, which means I will finish this set in January. It would be fantastic to hear news that the second season is on the way!",1135468800,4,1712,4.242331288343558

The pilot is missing from the set; disc one is full of glitches in video and sound. I was unable to watch The Dark and Bloody Ground due to it freezing about 15 minutes into the episode each time. The first episode seemed to be okay except for minor glitches but still watchable. The problems with the second episode (see above) spoiled the whole experience for me though. Whoever Universal used for their DVD burning/production did a really poor job. I hope they feel they got their money's worth, I sure don't!

I wonder if one or more of the Universal DVD masters for disc #3 is flawed?  If so, hopefully Universal will respond and correct this issue soon.
Discs #1 and #2 seem to work perfectly.
It might be sensible, for those trying to defend Universal, to investigate the mastering instead of simply assuming DVD player incompatibility.  More than one customer has identified symptoms that suggest mastering problems.
The show, itself, is superb--the best show of the 1970s, combining action, subtle comedy, and thoughtful themes and story lines.",1135036800,7,765,5.055555555555555

The quality of this box set is pretty good... it appears as if they have put in the original episodes and not the ones that are currently airing on TV. One person wrote on amazon.com this:

""I find myself at the mercy of WGN, the Chicago 'superstation' that just butchers these shows, cutting out entire scenes to accomodate their commercials for ambulance-chasing lawyers and other advertising aimed at shut-ins and jobless losers.""

I found that to be pretty funny because it is 100% true. I love WGN but they air the same three commercials over and over and over again. Unless you overdosed on VIOXX or died leaving a baby mindless these commercials don't apply to you.

Anyway... I ranked this with 4-stars because it would have been cool if they would have included some comentary about the production of the episodes or had other special features.

604218,5,6303186874,"((EDIT: I'm now done with Season 1 and my disc 3 played fine, no freezes. My dvd player is a ''CyberHome'' $40 cheapy, also. As the season progressed I was becoming concerned since I was becoming IN LOVE with it. My Dragnet (Universal) froze many times but since I didn't like the series anyway I sold it. My Quincy also had problems (again, Universal) but honestly, that series cannot touch Rockford, so I guess it all worked out.))

To start with, I for one love the packaging. I think Jim looks pretty much like he does during the run of the show on the cover, plus I love the color scheme. If you want to see an actor look MUCH OLDER than he does during the run of the show on the cover art, check out Columbo; now HE looks 75! Plus, I really like the menu screens; I like the touch of having the LA Freeway signs it really fits the style of the show. As far as disc quality; this set froze only once and that was in the interview which was the first thing I watched!

The picture quality is really a mixed bag. The colors are often quite vivid though there are quite a few artifacts from time to time which can be quite annoying. The sound is fairly standard ""70's"" and I still do not know why they do NOT remaster the sound to 5.1.
As far as the soundtrack, it really deserves a nod and is a standout in the 70's arena. The folksy blurb of the harmonica and the gentle strummings of a guitar/banjo seem to fit the laid back nature of the show and the 70's-esque Linda McCartney keyboard ""sound"" brings us full-circle and gives Rockford an unforgettable aura.

The shows themselves are just great. Sprinkled with just enough sarcasm and dry wit to seperate this from the usual 70's ""stuff"" and yet not TOO much to make the shows seem like comedies. It truly is a great mixture of action, intrigue, and humor, there's just nothing like the Rockford Files, and very little way to explain its appeal.

Cannot wait for Season 2.... Can you believe how lucky we are to be living in THIS time?",1134950400,4,1992,4.304
604219,2,6303186874,"What's ugly is the box and all the menus. (Clearly, the designers at Universal decided to only use menu photos where Garner looks 75-years-old.)

What's great is obvious: the show itself. Man, does this ride get better every year. (Probably the only thing from the 1970s that one can say that of.) It is just so human, funny, and stylish. And the great thing about the set are the completeness and visual/audio quality of the eps. Don't be fooled -- this is the best the episodes have ever looked and sounded.

What's rotten is everything else. No extras. Cheap disks. No pilot. If you have access to a NTSC/PAL DVD player, I highly recommend picking up the British release which does have some extras and does include the Pilot.

Let's pray that Season Two gets a better treatment than did Season One.",1134950400,10,802,4.633802816901408

So I might not be the most unbiased review that appears here. So what? As others have said, this is arguably one of the best TV series ever. For years after it went into syndication I passed up current shows to watch Rockford reruns. There were plenty of other cheesy P.I. shows like it, but there was only one Rockford. The list of episodes is elsewhere so I won't redo them here - and I assume you are not from Remulac so that you don't need me to tell you what the show is about. What I do want to share is the quality of the discs - which is superb. The colors are well satturated, and the image is digitized perfectly. There is only one (English) audio track which is very good, even if it is 2 channels. There are Spanish subtitles. Disc one has an on-camera interview with James Garner, which is the extent of the bonus materials. I'm not all fussed about concurrent commentary, so I am not upset that there was not one here. My only beef, a big one at that, is that they are 2-sided discs. I (and most of the other reviewers, I daresay), would prefer one-sided discs to ease on the wear and tear. Still, I won't quibble, and give this five stars, just out of the sheer pleasure of having this long overdue series out on DVD.

I recommend buying this just for the opportunity to watch Rockford, and look for the cameos by stars who later became famous, like James Woods, Suzanne Sommers and Ned Beatty. My sixteen year-old walked in whie I was watching these and he got hooked by the theme (it was ""cool""), enough to sit down and watch it with me. His comment was that ""TV was better back then."" I agree with him heartily. I hope that they aren't too slow in releasing subsequent seasons. After they are done with this, I also hope they do a reprise by releasing my other favorite series.

All 22 first-season episodes are here (The box lists 23 shows because ""This Case is Closed,"" which originally aired as a 90-minute episode is inexplicably split in two.) Missing, however, is the pilot ""Backlash of the Hunter."" In his Emmy-winning role as anti-hero Jim Rockford, James Garner is superb, as is his supporting cast -- Noah Beery Jr., Joe Santos, Stuart Margolin, and Gretchen Corbett. And the sterling writing remains as sharp and witty as ever -- that's the good news.

Unfortunately, Universal still can't get it right when it comes to dual-layer, dual-sided DVDs. The third disc is plagued by incessant freezing -- on the set I have, only the first episode on the third disc (""Sleight of Hand"") played without incident. Beyond that, there's nothing but problems, rendering the seven remaining episodes unwatchable. This is unacceptable, and Universal needs to hear about it, and hear about it often. This has been a constant issue with other Universal dual-sided releases, including ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker.""

I can get around the fact that the extras are minimal -- only a brief interview with James Garner -- or that the episodes show residue and age. But releasing this fine TV show on often inoperable discs is unforgivable.

604310,5,6303186874,"In my opinion Jim Rockford(as played by James Garner) is the best character to have ever graced a television screen.

Now, I never had the benefit of watching The Rockford Files when it first aired (being as how I was born about halfway through the series) but I became addicted to the wonder and spectacle of the show when I discovered it in my freshman year of college. With some of the quality shows that are on TV nowadays and with a good number of the ones I have seen in the past I can say without the slightest bit of hesitation that this is one of my very favorite TV shows. Ever.

Jim Rockford is a private detective. Yet, not in your classic Maltese Falcon or Sam Spade sense...Jim is a little closer to reality...and it is a reality that at times he no doubt wishes was somebody's sick imagination. Jim lives in a trailer along the coast of Los Angeles, is an ex-convict confidence man (he keeps his own business card press in his car) who seems to have the bad luck of somebody that broke one too many mirrors in a previous life. He can also be a pain in the ass at times...mostly to the wrong people yet, he can also be a tad too trusting...again, of the wrong people.

Yet, there is something instantly likeable about Jim Rockford that makes you root for him. I think it has to do with the fact that he seems so real. He is a hero without a doubt but there is a seediness to him that brings him down to Earth and the fact that he gets so easily screwed out of money (among other things) makes his character so relatable to the viewer. In essence, Jim Rockford has traits that we (or people we know) have that makes him so easy to accept.

Yet, this show isn't a ""one trick pony"" in that it just has one good character. When you mix in Rockford's father (a loveable old trucker who tends to be a little clueless), his best friend Angel (an ex-con con man who seems to have even worse luck than Rockford), and Dennis (Rockford's cop buddy who will quickly abandon him if it means he could get fired) among others further add to the enjoyment of what could have been one of a hundred other run of the mill detective programs.

No, The Rockford Files is a unique, hilarious, intriguing, and downright enjoyable TV show. Anybody that hasn't seen it, whether you like what is on TV or not, owes it to themselves to give it a shot.

After trying them on multiple DVD players, and returning them to the store for new copies, I STILL do not have playable discs!

(You see, in 1969, we hadn't experienced Nixon's price controls, the EPA, the Energy Crisis, inflation and the 55 mph speed limit) You will find much of the same dry wit and great one liners Garner is famous for.

604315,5,6303186874,"James Garner's laconic charm as Jim Rockford kept us coming back for more each week and finally won him an Emmy in 1977. Garner, who would have been a star in any era, and sometimes seemed as if he would have fit more into films of the 1940's, finally found the perfect role on television as Jim Rockford, an ex-con given a full pardon when it was discovered he was innocent after all.  Working as a P.I. and parking his gold Firebird in front of his trailor on the L.A. beach, Rockford could never quite shake the ex-con tag, nor could he shake his old cellmate, Evelyn ""Angel"" Martin.

Stuart Margolin was simply fantastic as the scheming Angel, always with an angle, and always certain to get Rockford into trouble when it backfired. Like Rockford, you just couldn't stay mad at Angel, no matter what con had blown up in his face or how much trouble he would get our favorite TV detective in from time to time. Rockford and Angel remained friends because of that unspoken bond all ex-cons have, and because deep down, Angel was a stand-up guy, though you couldn't always tell it from looking at the surface.

Except for the 90 minute pilot episode, ""Backlash of the Hunter,"" starring Lindsay Wagner as Sarah Butler, who would resurface in another episode from the first season, ""Aura Lee, Farewell,"" Noah Beery Jr. portrayed Rockford's lovable dad, Rocky. Rocky was a retired trucker who loved to fish, and passed on the hobby to Jim. It was the little moments like fishing that were really the heart and soul of this show when you stop to think about it. There were always a few slice-of-life moments mingled in with the great car chases, glorious con games, and other assorted mischief, as Rockford tried to solve a closed case and stay out of jail at the same time. Some weeks he was just trying to stay alive. Rocky would always give Jim that ""look"" if he had to come post bail.

Joe Santos was Rockford's often exasperated police pal, Dennis Becker. He was the buffer between Rockford and Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins), who hated Rockford and would have liked to take away his P.I. license. Becker was a pal, but could only do so much for Jim as he had to stay out of hot water with Diehl himself. He had a wife and kids to support, and for some strange reason, that sometimes took priority over helping Rockford out of a complicated jam.

Last, but by no means least, was Gretchen Corbett as lawyer Beth Davenport. The relationship between she and Rockford was complicated. They both had a deep affection for each other, which was sometimes complicated by the attorney-client relationship. Her efforts to keep Jim out of trouble with the cops took up a lot of her time. There was a romance of sorts between the two, but it never matured into something that would lead to marriage.

The first season had some great guest stars, in addition to the already mentioned Lindsay Wagner. Other guest stars from season one were: Ned Beaty, Sharon Gless, James Woods, Linda Evans, Jackie Cooper, Hector Elizondo, Diana Muldaur, Suzanne Somers, Tony Mustane, and screen legend Joseph Cotton.

There were many great episodes the first season, in addition to the 90 minute pilot. Those episodes are as follows: THE KIRKOFF CASE -- THE DARK AND BLOODY GROUND -- THE COUNTESS -- EXIT PRENTISS CARR -- TALL WOMAN IN RED WAGON -- THIS CASE IS CLOSED I -- THIS CASE IS CLOSED II -- THE BIG RIPOFF -- FIND ME IF YOU CAN -- THE PURSUIT OF CAROL THORNE -- THE DEXTER CRISIS -- ""CALEDONIA, IT'S WORTH A FORTUNE"" -- PROFIT AND LOSS I -- PROFIT AND LOSS II -- AURA LEE, FAREWELL -- SLIGHT OF HAND -- COUNTER GAMBIT -- CLAIRE -- SAY GOODBYE TO JENNIFER -- CHARLIE HARRIS AT LARGE -- THE FOUR POUND BRICK -- JUST BY ACCIDENT -- ROUNDABOUT

Stephen J. Cannell and Roy Huggins created this wonderful series and Juanita Bartlett wrote some of the finest scripts ever done for television. James Garner was absolutely perfect as Jim Rockford, and it has become difficult as the years have passed to separate the two in our minds. Garner was, and is, a great actor and screen presence who made everything look easy. This was a terrific show and one of the best ever to be beamed into our homes once a week.

This DVD set has been too long coming, but now that it's just around the corner, there is a sense of anticipation by fans who will be chomping at the bit until it's in their hot little hands. We all will, as everyone loved ""The Rockford Files"" and couldn't wait to hear Mike Post's great theme music each week. It was recorded and turned into a radio hit it was so good.

Once again we will get to listen to all those crazy messages left on Jim Rockford's answering machine. Fans never missed the opening of the show because a smile or a good laugh might be missed. You don't want to miss it either.

604371,5,6303186874,"While we are waiting around for this to be released, let's visit my 10 favorite episodes in this series. Don't ding my review if you don't agree; just write your own.

10. Sleight of Hand

Rockford is terribly confused about the disappearance of his girlfriend upon returning from a trip to SanFran. Immediately after the disappearance, the girl's neighbor gets killed, and the police never believe in coincidences, especially when it concerns Jim. Rockford traces everything back to a place where the two stopped the night of the disappearance, only to find the mob involved. Rockford smokes them out with two clever, but not particularly honest, 911 calls. ""Hello, Police. Yeah, there's a holdup here at the hotel. You better hurry, there's 4 or 5 of them.""

9. THE GREAT BLUE LAKE LAND AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY

As Rockford's ""friend,"" Fast Harry states in this episode, ""you (Rockford) getting suckered. Who'd ever believe it!"" Well, believe it. Rockford, having car trouble, gives 10 grand in cash to some company salesman with the hopes that he will lock it in the company's safe -- after closing time. Only, the salesman takes off, with no company record of money in the safe. Rockford soon gets the dough back, and a murder charge to boot. Turns out the salesman had wanted a bigger piece of company extortion, and Rockford always seems to be in the right place to be a good patsy. The jail break here is priceless.

8. THE NO-CUT CONTRACT

Rob Reiner plays himself (well, someone as obnoxious as Reiner is, anyway) as a football player with an overblown ego who's taped the wrong guys talking about deals. Reiner gave the tapes to Rockford, or so he tells the mob, and Rockford becomes a target for thugs.

7. JOEY BLUE EYES

One of the more interesting episodes, as Rockford never gets himself into trouble. Well, not too bad. Joey, an ex-con, makes a bad business deal with some mob guys in suits and needs Rockford's help getting out of it. As Gandy (Rockford's prison buddy in other episodes) would say, ""you are always trying to get by on your mouth."" True, which annoys Joey, as he is more at home being a goon. Anyway, Rockford works one of his patented scams to success.

6. COLTER CITY WILDCAT

Rocky gets beat up by a couple of thugs who want him to sign over an oil lease. Jim and Rocky travel up to the land to find out there is some organized crime going on, unknown to the government land surveyor. After getting busted for a murder they didn't do, they make a deal to try and sell Rocky's lease, so the real murderers will be forced to buy it.

5. BEAMER'S LAST CASE

Rockford isn't too happy upon his return from vacation. Not only does he still owe the casino, he finds out some idiot has been using his identity and playing investigator. Beamer, who Rockford correctly describes as ""100% chucklehead,"" couldn't investigate the loss of his wallet, but this was a fun episode with Rockford, as usual, frustrated.

4. THE QUEEN OF PERU

Speaking of frustrated, Rockford isn't too happy with an obnoxious RV family when they steal his BBQ grill. It had a diamond in there planted by thieves trying to rip off the insurance company. Rockford has to deal with an idiot insurance adjuster, and has to chase down the camper folks halfway across California. ""Ronko, the only thing we are going to split is your lip.""

3. HEARTACHES OF A FOOL

The episode starts off with a truck crash, then a fight. It seems Rocky's retirement driving amounts to smuggling sausages from Mexico. Of course, Rocky doesn't know this, and Rockford needs to find out what's going on. So, he finds the Country Music singer who's name is on the sausages. After a rough start, the two figure out the mob is behind sausages made in Mexico that should be made in Arkansas.

2. A FAST COUNT

Rockford helps out a fight promoter who's gipped a few people. But he himself is getting gipped by a car dealer. Rockford works through confusion to get to the real scam, but by then loses his investment. One of the better parts is when Rockford, after causing havoc for the thugs, is on his way out of the dealership and sees another salesman. ""Hey, there's been a pretty bad accident in there. You better go see if you can help.""

1. THE TREES, THE BEES AND T.T. FLOWERS (2)

Two episodes, but Rockford's best work. In laws are trying to illegally get property owned by an old coot who's a bit on the hazy side. Rockford, as always, gets in their way. But he has to bust the guy out of the wacko ward, as well as keep from getting beat up. While making his break from the ward, he comes upon a security guard who is wondering what's going on: ""I don't know. But they were saying it was all your fault. Something about Johnson missing.""

James Garner absolutely is the hardest-working, greatest actor ever to appear on the small screen.  Case closed.  When you watch The Rockford Files, his incredible charisma just sucks you right in.  The perfect mix of comedy, drama, suspense, and action - and James Garner is the glue that holds it all together.  He almost killed himself (literally) to make this show work, and the bottom line is, it should be on DVD.

I'm in the same boat as many of the reviewers here, I have most all of the episodes taped, but the picture bounces, the sound is getting fuzzy, and the shows are all hacked up for syndication.  The time is now for all of us Rockford fans to be able to watch this show in its entirety and in digitally remastered glory.

604377,5,6303186874,"The Rockford Files are important for a number of reasons.  First, the series provides an uncommonly candid and relatively realistic glimpse into many aspects of life in urban Southern California in the mid-late 1970's.  The show was clearly crafted by intelligent and savvy individuals who also consistently displayed a sense of warmth and humor along with the portrayal of some of the uglier sides of human nature.  James Garner was nothing short of superb in his role as James Rockford, establishing his character's credibility through a clear understanding of Rockford's persona, values and eccentricities.  Stuart Margolin as Angel Martin was priceless in his successful depiction of the archetypal fairweather friend who was often more of a liability than an aid to Rockford's detective work.  Lastly, the show featured a number of other guest stars, including Isaac Hayes, Robert Weber, Dionne Warwick and Tom Selleck, just to mention a few.  All in all, this show exists as an intelligent, insightful and often very entertaining survey of the action/detective/crime/drama milieu.",1113868800,24,1086,5.434523809523809

I know Rockford does well on TV Land, but isn't it time to give collectors what they want?  Hurry up with this one.  You have my pledge to buy every season immediately upon release!  I can't believe this won't be a huge seller.  The show really holds up.  The mysteries are actually on par with those in current crime dramas doing well in the ratings.  I mean the guy that did the Sopranos (David Chase) started out writing on Rockford Files! Give us JIMBO now!",1099958400,20,618,4.275862068965517
604443,5,6303186874,"Absolutely cannot agree more - WE WANT JIMMY ON DVD!!

One of the best action/drama/comedy series of all time, bar none. Clearly a direct predecessor to series such as ""Northern Exposure"" and ""The Sopranos,"" which skillfully blend drama and humor into a highly enjoyable mix.

Also a semi-inspiration for ""Magnum, P.I."" (Tom Selleck was a hilarious recurring character in several 'Rockford' episodes) and Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs character in the 'Lethal Weapon' series (Riggs lived in a trailer on the Malibu beach in the same exact location Jim Rockford's had been. You could even imagine Riggs and Rockford being next-door neighbors (boy, is THAT ever a movie sequel idea...  ;^) Murtaugh..'I'm getting too old for this $##$'... Riggs, 'So am I' .. Rockford: 'YOU'RE getting too old for it?!?!?' )

Anyway, if and when they (Universal??) get around to releasing The Rockford Files on DVD, I will buy it that day. Every single episode. The 1974 pilot to the final 1999 TV movie sequel. Cash on the barrel head. Right then, right there.

Rockford's sardonic humor, street smarts, and always get-the-girl-at-the-end good looks makes this series appealing to all generations, male or female. $200 a day plus expenses? He's definitely worth it!",1097712000,25,423,5.220588235294118

He's the only TV detective ever who was often broke and dodging bill collectors.  He's the only TV detective - and the first fictional detective period since Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe - who was a **true** world-weary and world-wise smartass.

Whoever is out there listening, put Rockford on DVD!

magnificent series was made and I can vouch for how well

the writers, actors, directors, producers and everyone else

involved were able to bring this slightly wacky society

to life on the TV screen.  Some episodes are quite serious

(the saddest being when Jim's girlfriend was rubbed out

by the mafia) and others amusing (many of those in which Angel

is involved).  Some episodes are based on real-life situations,

such as the one where Rocky's eccentric friend T T Flowers is

locked up in a retirement home/mental hospital against his will so that his evil son-in-law can get ahold of his property.
