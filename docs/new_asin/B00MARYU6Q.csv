8671198,5,B00MARYU6Q,I've been studying the JFK assassination since 1973. I am a poor reader and I learn better by watching documentaries. I am glad to add it to my collection.,1489795200,,155,4.379310344827586

8671201,3,B00MARYU6Q,"Good video for anyone researching the JFK assassination, Abraham Bolden the first African American Secret Serviceman explains many behind the scenes observations and the climate of hate surrounding the president from the men assigned to protect him.",1437177600,,249,5.756756756756757
8671202,2,B00MARYU6Q,"Awful production. At times Boldens voice is hardly discernible due to totally obsolete sound effects (thunder and rumbling). PQ is worse than could be expected from a DVD-production.
