8649271,1,B00JAD6FPC,"I bought this set mainly to view the Grand Canyon in preparation for a visit. In the 60 minutes in the section labeled ""Grand Canyon"", they showed it for maybe 5 minutes. And part of that was the same scene over and over. What a rip-off! The blurb is all about the Grand Canyon with barely a mention of the Colorado Plateau yet that is what they show the most of...6 or 7 other national parks, forests and monuments on the plateau. If you're not going to spend the most time on the Grand Canyon then don't advertise it as such. Call that section ""Colorado Plateau""! It's a classic bait and switch!",1462665600,5,597,4.339285714285714
