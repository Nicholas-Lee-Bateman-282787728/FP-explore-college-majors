8649318,5,B00JAD6C8C,"this set of McQueen The Best Of Wanted Dead Or Alive 25 episodes comes
 in a very striking metal tin with 3 DVDS for season 1-2-3
\As usual Steve McQueen was one of the best actors to come along in the day.
He became very popular as his time went on till he was too sick to act
One thing about movies made in his time there was no cuss words ever used.
It was a very family western.
There are serious movies and there are funny  movies. I have enjoyed watching
this series to wear out 4 sets now..
This series was ground breaking in its time and Stevce McQueen was one of
 the best actors and so enjoyable to listen and watch in this series.
Give it a try and you will relive the good old days. It deserves more than 5 stars.
