5767787,5,B00D2KVA0Y,"I bought this for my toddler son who just started getting into watching television shows. I wanted to offer something that was classic and not too modernized with some of today's themes and language. The DVD has excellent lessons for small children and a great variety of episodes. The doll is good quality, too.",1420848000,,312,4.796296296296297
5767788,5,B00D2KVA0Y,I have been looking for the Sister Bear Golden set for almost a year. It did not disappoint. My children love it and my daughter sleeps with her very own Sister Bear every night!  I read the books when I was a child so it's great to see my children loving the series as much.,1420848000,3,275,4.0

8588584,5,B00D2KVA0Y,"Excellent buy!  Purchased for my 6-year old, who loves the cuddly ""sister bear"" character that came with this!  My older kids loved it as well, BB DVDs are hard to beat for stuff that kids love to watch, that is also extremely kid-friendly to watch!  Did not find episode guide anywhere, so it was a gamble for me to buy, as I was afraid they might have been repeats to what I have.  Thankfully, most was ""new""' material not on our other DVDs.  But I will post so that no one else has to guess.

1. Go up and Down
2. Count Their Blessings
3. The Slumber Party
4. Homework Hassle
5. The In Crowd
6. Trouble at School
7. Female Fullback
8. That Stump Must Go

8588592,5,B00D2KVA0Y,The bear is cute. The dvd is pretty long for the $8 I paid for it. She loves the books and after watching the DVD she had us go to the library and check out every one of the books we could find.  She read them over and over. Worth it if you're trying to reinforce a desire to read the books.,1426377600,3,291,3.693548387096774
