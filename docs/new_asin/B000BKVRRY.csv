8135939,4,B000BKVRRY,"Viruta and Capulina met Lola and Lila.
Viruta and Capulina are two out of luck guys who go from here to there doing nothing. One day, while looking for a janitor job they're mistaken for a couple of engineers coming from New York (just like in HAPPY TEXAS) and from then on, they start pretending to know and do everything they are asked for, but unfit to do, like jumping from a plane or welding steel rods in skyscrapers higher than 30 stories.
''Working'' there is when they meet the girls. Maria Duval and Begoa Palacios are their co-workers but they don't really need the job because they sing and dance.
They have a couple musical numbers in a night club now and then.
I can not find the words to describe Begoa fairly, because when she is dancing a rock and roll song (No est aqu de LOS HOLLIGANS), she is wearing a light blue bathing suit with some huge sequins here and there, black shoes, headdress with really tall white feathers, and a huge pink boa.
Thank God gloves were not needed (?!) but she wore them (and Duval did too) in another scene in the middle of the desert, with over 100F, black, up to the elbow... isn't that charming?
I would see the movie again just to see that...",1316649600,,1195,4.36322869955157
