174693,5,098828278X,"It kept her attention during the entire show, and she has asked to watch it AGAIN repeatedly.  Ruby teaches children not only how to be safe, but why it so important: she reminds kids that they are loved. We've been searching for ways to teach about dangerous people and situations without overdoing it or causing unnecessary anxiety. Ruby's Studio: The Safety Show addresses this sensitive and important issue with gentleness and creativity. The show combines live action (with real kids) and really cute animation. We highly recommend this DVD!",1382400000,4,546,5.134831460674158
174694,5,098828278X,"I was the absolute worlds worst at scaring the kids in a panicked effort to keep the kids safe before watching Ruby's Studio: The Safety Show.  I don't want anything to happen to the kids but after watching this DVD I realized that I was going about my attempts to protect them, all wrong.  Not only was I denying them the chance to learn to trust their own instincts and how to teach them this lesson, I was making them so afraid they would actually squirm when anyone they didn't know would talk to them.  That is exactly what I wanted when it came to strangers, but I began to notice that they would do that with everyone even friends of our that I tried to introduce them to.  They wouldn't speak, and would even have panicked looks on their face from being addressed by anyone.
I now know the correct way to go about keeping the kids safe without scaring them senseless and I'm working to correct all of my errors.  This is a must see DVD of anyone who has children, watches children and teachers of elementary and middle school teachers.",1382400000,9,1043,4.383419689119171
174695,5,098828278X,All of Ruby studios dvd are great. My daughter that is in the autism spectrum loves them! I've been able to teach her a lot about emotions and safety which these videos. Very well produced.,1459987200,2,189,4.428571428571429
174696,4,098828278X,My four year old son likes to watch it and had started telling us when we do thumbs down stuff...lol I wish it had more on stranger danger.,1454716800,,139,4.0
174697,5,098828278X,"Very well done. I was unsure what it would contain so I watched it myself first, but it's a very gentle introduction to safety for kids. It tells them what they need to know without scaring them.",1449532800,3,195,4.297297297297297

174700,5,098828278X,"What a brilliant and helpful resource for such an important topic!  I watched it with my sons 3 and 5.5 unsure how long it would hold their interest, and they were engaged and entertained the whole way through.  It hits the perfect tone of being informative, accessible and impactful without scaring kids.  It made me, and them, feel empowered.  It is of course my responsibility to continue the conversation, but this is such an amazing springboard for that - I'm so grateful to have found it!",1430697600,2,494,4.709302325581396

174703,5,098828278X,"Great. Just  the right amount of caution enforced, w/o being scary in any way. My 3 1/2 year old really liked it and could sing the ""Whose the Boss of My Body"" song in no time.",1408665600,,176,3.888888888888889
174704,5,098828278X,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. She watched the whole Safety show completely. It is full of singing, dancing, animation and real talk about safety for kids. She is a little on the young side for it but we are going to play it many times in the future. The kids in the studio talk with Ruby about strangers and being in charge of their bodies. It's presented in a hip empowering way and not scary. This was money well spent.",1407542400,,433,4.166666666666667

But the truth is, the whole topic made me deeply uncomfortable, so I always had an excuse to put it off.  We had watched another safety video, which was helpful, but I knew the job wasn't really done.  When my friend Jodi introduced me to The Mother Company and I saw this DVD, I bought it right away.

I played it for my daughter in the minivan, so I can't honestly say I've ""watched"" it since I was driving, but I did listen along with her.  It's so well done and positive and empowering, I've already started recommending it to friends.  I asked her what her favorite part was she said it was the song, ""I'm the boss of my body.""  The real proof of how much she liked it was a few days later she asked to watch it again!

All I can say is that if you have a kid and you want to educate them about staying safe, don't even think about the $15, just do it.  There are just too many weirdos out there (that don't always look like weirdos) to take chances.  I'm very relieved to have found this DVD.",1400198400,10,1451,5.352422907488987
174707,5,098828278X,"We love Ruby Studio and the Mother Company! All of their videos and books are great for children (and adults). I especially like the Safety Show because it teaches kids to listen to their ""uh-oh"" feeling rather than ""stranger danger"" which is not as useful.",1397433600,,257,4.733333333333333
174708,5,098828278X,"Very well done presentation of the topic, interesting to children and parents alike. Good production value and sensitive coverage of the topic",1394323200,,142,5.5
174709,4,098828278X,"We have two other Ruby's Studio DVDs and they are unique and engaging. This one is particularly useful on a tricky topic -- personal safety for kids, and it is right in line with the message and approach in Gavin De Becker's book ""Protecting the Gift"" - an excellent adjunct to this material for parents.

Essentially, the message here and in De Becker's book is that the key to safety without fear and worry is to learn to trust your instincts, and teach your kids to trust their instincts. As opposed to teaching kids about ""stranger danger"", which is not effective against predators who are known to the child (and statistically most are), teach them to be proactive in deciding how they feel about a person or situation, and trusting their own power to exit an uncomfortable one -- and when in doubt, check in with mom or dad.

Topics on the Safety Show DVD include strategies for children to: find help if lost in a public place; deal with a strange adult who claims to know their parents, offers a treat or asks inappropriately for help; handle all kinds of unwanted touching, and feel complete autonomy over their own bodies; and feel comfortable saying no to any situation they gauge to be unsafe.

As is typical for the Ruby Studio DVDs, there are some catchy songs, lots of kids being interviewed, an art activity, some beautiful animations, and a memorable game and review at the end to help drive the lessons home. This time around, the ""Ruby"" character - my kiddo calls her a ""babysitter"" - is wearing less makeup and seems a bit more natural than in the previous titles. It's a subtle but excellent improvement.

The DVD extra with parent tips is especially helpful. There are a lot of potential pitfalls in teaching young kids about safety - it is easy to scare kids - and the tips help guide parents away from being too graphic or explaining too much.

The only thing I find slightly off-putting in the Ruby Studio series is the opening titles where you see the Ruby character, a 20-something hipster, skipping around her urban neighborhood blowing kisses to children who seem to be playing unsupervised in parks and city streets. It's odd.

Highly recommend for ages 4-8. Such an important topic, and so few of us who are parents now were taught any kind of self-defense as children. A great resource! Bravo!",1393977600,5,2325,4.658536585365853
174710,5,098828278X,"This is a fantastic video. After it was over the first time, my oldest son wanted to re-watch it-- immediately.
It is such a scary world we live in and this video helps teach your kids about safety without frightening them.
We also purchased the Feelings video, but haven't watched it yet, b/c this one is such a hit at our house.",1393200000,,330,4.338709677419355

174713,5,098828278X,"Talking to your kids about personal safety is so important but sometimes gets lost in all the craziness of school, activities and life. This video makes it so easy.

174714,5,098828278X,"I had my 5 year old sit down with me to watch this and she has asked a lot of questions regarding safety. She was also very attentive while watching the DVD and understand too since it is geared towards children. She interacted with Ruby from the show, right along with the children in the DVD too. This show has a lot of cute graphics to keep your child's attention, which I think is very important when showing your child something important. I really recommend you checking this out with your kiddos too.",1382400000,3,507,4.462365591397849

7795342,5,098828278X,I watched it with my 3.5 yr and 6 yr olds. Both finished the whole video and enjoyed it.  The 6 yrs old (cautious one) got the concept but the 3.5 yrs old (outgoing one) probably didn't get all the concept.  it's not too outdated and it's simple enough for both of them to understand. I think it's a good starter for young kids.,1509321600,2,328,4.109375
