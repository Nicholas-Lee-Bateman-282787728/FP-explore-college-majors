8679085,5,B00NLZAARO,"Well. I think I will probably love this,  BUT THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES.  Also, ""Que Bonito Amor"", which was recently released has NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!  You would think if a movie is sold to us in the USA would always have subs, especially when many new telenovelas are produced in Florida and California!  All my other foreign films purchased from AmazonFrance, Italy, Germany, Israel, Asian have ENGLISH SUBTITLES.  Guy Ecker, (he is the star of this movie) was born in the USA.maybe he will check the reviews here to see what we have to say and take pity on us!!!!!!  LOL",1418774400,9,580,4.637254901960785
