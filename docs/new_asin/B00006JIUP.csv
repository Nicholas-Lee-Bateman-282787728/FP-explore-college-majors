The video is well-organized and highly informative, even for those (like me) who already know quite a bit about China adoption.  Ms. Nee provides some valuable suggestions for making the process (including the trip) easier and more enjoyable.  Also included is Ms. Nee's extraordinarily moving first meeting with her daughter.  Whether you're just thinking about adopting from China, have already made the decision, or are waiting for your referral, this video is quite worthwhile!",1042675200,21,555,5.4941176470588236
1780308,5,B00006JIUP,"This is a must have video!  Becky Nee covers everything from the need for adoption to the paperwork, packing, traveling to China and bonding with baby.  My husband and I took tons of notes and learned many new things through this informative video. In fact we are going to show it to our parents so they can better understand their grandaughter and where she came from.  We feel we are much better prepared for our adoption trip next month.  Also, it was touching to see her personal story and the moment she received her new daughter.  I highly recommend!!!!",1031961600,12,559,4.606060606060606
1780309,5,B00006JIUP,"I have had the wonderful opportunity to view this film.  It is filled with lots of great ideas and suggestions and Becky's training and talent as a news anchor really shows through.  There are a lot of heart-warming scenes that as a prospective parent I would have loved to have seen before traveling to China.  This film takes a lot of the mystery out of the process and allows the viewer a sneak peek as to some of the things they might expect to experience on this journey even though the process can be a little different for each family.
It is a great comprehensive guide to adoption from China and well worth taking the time to watch!  I know that I personally get more out of viewing something rather than reading about it.  For me as a parent who has already been through the process it brought back a lot of memories even though the regulations and a lot of the procedures have changed since 1998 when Mikaylin came home. A good resource for prospective adoptive parents considering adoption from China.",1031875200,13,1012,4.538461538461538
7970219,5,B00006JIUP,"For some reason, Amazon will not link this page to the DVD version of this video, so I have posted it below. I am reducing the price of the DVD by half because the video is becoming old, although much of the information is still relevant. I plan to discontinue the DVD in 2008 and am no longer selling the VHS version. I hope those who decide to view it have found it helpful with their own journey to parenthood.

7970220,5,B00006JIUP,"This is an extremely helpful video that really summarizes nicely the China-adopt experience, particulalry the 'paperchase' aspect of it.  Even with longer wait times, most of the information is still very relevant.",1185148800,,214,5.6875
7970221,4,B00006JIUP,"My wife and I adopted from China a few years ago and we just about wore the VHS version of this DVD out.  We reccomend this DVD to everyone that asks us about adopting from China.  And they all love it.  The only possible problem is that it is slightly out of date but the vast majority of the information is still relevant.

Good luck  with your adoption.",1157414400,2,356,4.176470588235294
7970222,4,B00006JIUP,"From ""considering"" to ""waiting"" this video covers it all. My husband & I especially appreciated the complete listings of items to pack, VERY HELPFUL!! I referred back to it many times during our waiting period for help preparing, as well as just a little support. Some of the information may be a bit confusing or not apply to your family since details vary from agency to agency and laws are changing all the time. But overall I would highly recommend this video for anyone adopting from China or even considering adopting from China.",1142380800,2,535,4.763440860215054
7970223,5,B00006JIUP,"We are in the waiting stage for our adoption from China and wish we had gotten this video earlier.  It details the entire process in a well organized, easy to understand manner.  We would highly recommend it.  We wish however there was more coverage of the time in China.",1135036800,2,271,4.489795918367347
7970224,4,B00006JIUP,"This is an excellent video for people starting their process of adoption from China.  It's main focus is on the trip to pick up your daughter.  They do a great job with the lists of things to bring and how to pack.  I have watched it twice and have started making my list.  It also makes a good point to start researching your pediatrician now, if you don't already have one.  Most of the girls are sick when you get them and a doctor can perscribe mild medications to make your new daughter's plan ride home a lot easier and more comfortable for everyone.

The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the quality of the tape.  It should be converted to DVD and the sound quality should be improved.",1129680000,4,701,4.186567164179104
7970225,5,B00006JIUP,"Having adopted twice from China, I found this video to be very informative and remarkably current in its discussion of adopting from China.  My mother found it very useful, as it clearly spelled out the process that was already quite familiar to me.  I recommend it both for adoptive parents and their family members and friends who would like to know more about the process.",1127347200,3,375,4.753846153846154
7970226,5,B00006JIUP,The information in the video was very helpful. It will be a great help to anyone traveling to China to adopt.,1126051200,,109,4.238095238095238
7970227,1,B00006JIUP,"The video is helpful for someone thinking about adopting from China, but it is not worth the price.  Home movie quality and not very in-depth.",1124409600,,142,4.68
7970228,5,B00006JIUP,"If you think you know it all (just as we thought) think again and buy this video. Give it as a shower gift, birthday present, Anniversary gift or whatever you can come up with to any parent or single at any stage in the China adoption process.
It's a definite must for anyone who's planning or is in the midsts of their process, Rebecca Coates Nee gives a detailed view of the process, the do's and don'ts. She shares her experience and gives recommendations from beginning to end. You'll definitely want to take notes.
Finally she shares her own adoption video footage with us and applies it towards suggestions for the rest of us. It's something I believe no China adoption parent in the process should be without!
*Take it from me, I'm usually the last one to get anything, I'm sure glad I got this!*",1085011200,9,803,4.506849315068493
