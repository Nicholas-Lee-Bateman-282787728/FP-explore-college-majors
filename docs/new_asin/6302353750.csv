455981,4,6302353750,"The film is an adventure film in Japan, after the conquest of China by Japan and before Japan launches its attack against the US. Some, in the Japanese military, caressed  the idea of conquering the world and for them that implied conquering China first and then the US. This plan did exist of course but its revelation around 1940, a scoop by an America newspaperman of the Tokyo Chronicle caused a severe crisis in Japanese political circles because the surprise effect that was supposed to be essential for the attack on the US was destroyed. The plot is slightly thickened by the use of a Chinese woman as a spy by the Japanese secret police. This Chinese woman had her own objective : blocking Japan in order for China to reconquer its freedom. The film is well done though some details are a little bit sloppy, particularly concerning this Chinese woman who is spied upon by Japanese secret services without her seeming to know. Kind of naive.

455982,2,6302353750,"(Please note that of the eight DVD versions of BLOOD ON THE SUN that are currently listed on Amazon.com, I am reviewing the Laserlight ""Special Edition"" release.  That's the one that comes with a documentary on the film career of James Cagney and a goofier-than-thou introduction by Tony Curtis.)
To be honest, I didn't find the feature film on this DVD to be all that exciting.  The plot is coherent and without any obvious flaws, and the characters have a lot of promise.  It just isn't terribly enthralling.  There's a fairly good fight sequence near the end, if that sort of thing interests you.  Unfortunately, that sort of thing doesn't usually interest me, and nothing leading up to that had given me any emotional investment in either of the factions.  James Cagney's acting is quite good, and, as always, he commands quite a presence on the screen.  It's unfortunate that he's one of the only interesting things to watch in this film.
The picture quality is actually fairly good which is a bonus when you consider how cheap the disc is.  The picture is the tiniest bit fuzzy at points, but for the most part it's ahead of many other budget DVDs.  The sound quality is certainly acceptable, if not the clearest thing you'll ever hear.  If you've already seen and enjoyed this movie and are wondering which DVD version you should buy, know that you could do a lot worse than the Laserlight edition.
The included documentary JAMES CAGNEY ON FILM runs 36 minutes long and is a fairly formulaic piece, very similar to the other such programs that Laserlight has included on their DVDs.  It's a fairly tame short piece, made up primarily of an uninspired voice-over speaking while the camera pans over numerous black and white publicity shots of Cagney.  A few film trailers make up the rest of the action.  I didn't know much of anything about James Cagney before, so I found the information to be interesting, albeit a bit dry.  I speculate that any real Cagney fans would probably know much, if not everything that this documentary covers.
Tony Curtis' introduction here sees the man in one of his most bizarre spots yet.  The short, black, leather gloves from his other Laserlight DVD comments are back with a vengeance here, and they help turn what would otherwise be a short, forgettable James Cagney impersonation into good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.  He gives a brief history of James Cagney's career that manages to be utterly divergent from the story that the documentary gave.  I can only assume that someone held the wrong cue-cards that day.
All in all, I didn't care much for this DVD.  If you're a huge fan of James Cagney's work, then it might be worth your while to pick up, but if not, I'd recommend trying something else.  The documentary isn't bad, but it's not something that makes the disc attractive by itself.",1016755200,5,2839,4.745417515274949

455984,4,6302353750,"Blood on the Sun is a rousing post war film, a true product of its time. One minor fault with the movie is that it takes place in the 1930's, and everyone is wearing post war fashions. The supporting cast has a few surprises, Hugh Beaumont(Ward Cleaver) and Robert Armstrong (King Kong) as Col. Tojo. Sylvia Sydney is very alluring as Ms. Hilliard, she brings a sophistication to the movie that is usually absent in a Cagney thriller. The climactic battle with Oshima has been described in other reviews here as corny and outdated, but I think they have missed the mark. Judo is a sport, and is not Jujitsu, Judo is mostly throws and locks which the combatants in this movie do quite well. It may not be flashy like todays martial arts, but that is the stuff that I think is corny, defying gravity, impossible moves, and so on. when the battles seem believable, then it is more exciting, Bruce Lee for instance, I think there is no doubt that he could have executed all the moves in his movies in a street fight. That is one of the reasons he will always be the remembered as the best. Another interesting point, the actor who plays Oshima (Jack Halloran) was a LA cop and a master of Judo, Cagney was his student and became a black belt, hollywood's first! Cagney would go on to showcase more martial arts in the movies 13 Rue Madelaine, and White Heat, where he uses a forward choke on Virginia Mayo.",998784000,,1402,4.437984496124031

455988,2,6302353750,"Maybe if Alfred Hitchcock had directed Blood On the Sun the film  wouldn't be strangled by the phlegmatic pace and the sluggish acting.  Based loosely on a true story involving Japanese plans for a world invasion, Blood On the  Sun failed to convince this viewer of any suspenseful legitimacy. Although  director Frank Lloyd uses Japanese actors for some of the roles, the evil  characters do not possess depth or individuality.  The Japanese spys,  police officers, and government officials all talk, walk, look, and act  similarly. In addition the Japanese characters become muddled in murders,  inquistions, and counter intelligence which fail to define their  contributions to the plot.  James Cagney as the American reporter who has  obtained a copy of the invasion plans seems to be sleepwalking through his  part. Cagney does spark in the judo fight scenes in which he purportedly  trained for with a master judo expert. Why Warner Brothers would release  this film in 1945 when Japan had already been devastated by the horrors of  Atomic warfare is a mystery.  The film rankles with American jingoism and  takes a condescending stance against Japanese culture.  The film is  tiresome and bogged down by poor editing, plot structure, and dismal camera  work. One highlight of the film is the appearance of Sylvia Sydney who has  never looked more radiant on the screen.  Her face shines like an angel and  her wardrobe accentuates her petite body. Even for Cagney fans, Blood On  the Sun is a pass.  I took two twenty minute naps during the film's 90+  minute running time.",963705600,5,1580,5.0

Baron Tanaka wrote a secret plan on world conquest. An American newspaperman in Tokyo exposed it. It starts by showing a man falling in front of the ""Tokyo Chronicle"" while a crowd gathers. The police drive them away with staves. A Japanese official complains to the newspaper publisher. Where is Nick Condon? At a judo school. His article is a lie! But it came from New York newspapers. [Does that make it true?] Circulation and profits are up under Condon's leadership. Was that story a rumor? No matter. Nick visits a bar, two men join him. Was that story designed as a distraction? [Is one reporter too nosy?] Another reporter, Ollie Miller and his wife, are returning to America. Where did he get that money? A woman in black escapes from the ship! Nick calls his newspaper office, then goes home. There are shots! Ollie is wounded. He has a sealed envelope with a secret.

The Japanese police arrive to search for a criminal. Nick is invited to make a report. There were false charges to justify his arrest. Does he have proof of his charges? When he returns home he finds the damage was repaired! Then he gets an invitation to visit Baron Tanaka at home. The Jap Militarists have chose a policy. Nick meets Tanaka and Colonel Tojo. There is political division in Japan. The captain of that ship said Ollie and his wife were on board. Can Nick send a radiogram to get that ""forged document""? He names his price. No deal? Nick will return to America, he has a plan to get that document. A couple joins him at that bar. Nick notices the ring on Iris' left hand. Iris mentions a name from Shanghai. Iris has friends in high places; she reports to them. Can she find that document? Nick knows a fact about Joe Cassell. Nick spends time with Iris. They shake a tail.

Nick and Iris dine and talk. Iris is studying the problems of Japanese women; they are oppressed. Iris has a large and luxurious apartment. Her maid is Chinese. The next day there is an article about Joe Cassell. [Does this end his usefulness?] Joe talks to Nick and says too much. Nick goes to Iris and accuses her of working for the Japanese! [No recording devices then.] Iris took that letter and gives it to Nick. Can the signature be authenticated? Yes, says Iris. Later Iris gets a visitor who gives her a gift of silver coins. His failure also has consequences. Nick gets a message from Iris. A US Embassy official will take Nick to an American boat. But Nick goes to that wharf to meet Iris. A Japanese official signs that document as proof. It may prevent the Militarists' policy from succeeding. A small fishing boat will take them away. Nick will stall their pursuers. Nick challenges Oshima to a fight. [Wasn't that a stunt double who takes the falls?] Nick wins. He avoids the secret police (Kem-Pei-Tai). Can he reach the American Embassy? A sniper fires at him, he falls and is searched - no papers! A US Embassy official brings him in.

This 1943 propaganda movie also has pre-war intrigue. Can a secret document be published to reveal the policy of the Militarist? Its no secret that Japan had Imperial plans to conquer and occupy China, Siam, French Indo-China, and British Malaya. Could a newspaper report alone stop them? Only if it swayed public opinion in the targeted countries so they became allies. Most people are snowed in today by entertainment news or scandals.",1451692800,,3388,4.604304635761589

Nick Condon. (James Cagney) is a journalist for the Tokyo Chronicle. He prints a story disclosing Japan's plan to conquer the world. The newspaper is seized by Japanese officers. Condon gets the Tanaka Plan, a paper in which all the plans are described. The Japanese spies who follow him think that Ollie and Edith Miller (Wallace Ford and Rosemary DeCamp) are the ones who discovered the plan because they suddenly have a lot of money and are coming back to the USA. When Condon goes to the ship to bid them farewell, he finds Edith dead. He can only see a woman's hand with a huge ruby ring. Back home, he finds Ollie, in terrible condition. He gets the Tanaka plan from Ollie.

Premier Giichi Tanaka (John Emery) wants his plans to remain secret, and sends Col. Hideki Tojo (Robert Armstrong) Capt. Oshima (John Halloran) and Hijikata (Leonard Strong) to follow him everywhere. Condon hides the document with the Tanaka plan behind the Emperor Picture.

Condon meets Iris Hilliard (Sylvia Sidney), half American and half Chinese. At first, he suspects her of being the lady in the ship, then he doesn't. They fall in love. She seems to be betraying him, especially when Condon sees the ring with the ruby in her hand.

456057,3,6302353750,"Blood on the Sun is an enjoyable WWII fictional thriller starring James Cagney.

I urge everyone to guardedly see this film.

At the heart of the story is Nick Condon's (Cagney's character) relationship with a document prepared by Baron Tanaka Giichi of Japan which was presented to Emperor Hirohito in 1927.

The plan, known as the Tanaka Memorial, outlined the geopolitical military strategy for Japan's conquest of Asia.

The movie is a fictional story of how the plan was revealed to the world and disregarded by the American military authorities in charge of protecting Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

Intelligence scholars and World War II historians now conclusively assert that the Tanaka Memorial was a forged document created by Soviet intelligence in order to foster animosity and distrust between Japan and the United States.

The Wikipedia entry under ""Tanaka Memorial"" contains a good summary of these factual assertions.

The Tanaka Memorial also is a center of focus of Frank Capra's first episode in his Why We Fight series, Prelude to War, created during WWII as a propaganda vehicle for American military personnel and civilians outlining the reasons the United States entered the war.

Basically the Tanaka Memorial played the disinformation role for FDR's administration and WWII comparable to the Lyndon Johnson administration's lies concerning the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and Vietnam, and the George W. Bush administration's lies concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Iraq.

""The first casualty when war comes is truth,"" said American Senator Hiram Johnson in 1917.

Please read Phillip Knightley's powerful book, The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq, for more historical back ground context on how people have been deliberately lied to, bamboozled, and misled into war.

The now disgraced New York Times journalist Judith Miller has had many forbearers in forging duplicitous propaganda spurring on military intervention into needless, deadly and futile wars.

James Cagney plays one of those ""presstitutes.""",1364083200,,2088,5.410493827160494

456087,4,6302353750,"In ""Blood on the Sun,"" James Cagney plays an expat newspaper editor who discovers Japan's plot for world domination.  Made in 1945, the film is a bully piece of wartime propaganda--but it also has surprising depth.  It isn't PC, but it's not all stereotype either.  There are some real Asians in the film, the plot is a true story, and not all the Japanese are evil.  That said, yes, there are a lot of quasi-offensive squinty-eyed caucasians with fake buck teeth in the film, too.

Cagney does a very good job as the editor.  A bundle of self-assured energy, as ever, he nonetheless adds depth by trying to speak a bit of Japanese and Mandarin, and by doing some very credible judo.  Matter of fact, his judo coach was LAPD's Jack Halloran, who also took a role in this flick and went on to become a regular Hollywood character actor!

The movie is filmed almost entirely in sets at the studio, which is unsurprising.  Nevertheless, it looks fairly good.  In fact, the ""expat bar"" set is a faithful reproduction of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed bar at the old Imperial Hotel in Tokyo!

Cagney was just coming off an Oscar and just out of contract with WB Studios.  Here, he and his brother produced, and they did a decent job.  In short, the films hold up.  Not a major classic, but an exciting potboiler!  And as a correction to various reviewers, the film takes place neither in ""post-WWII Japan"" nor ""The 1920's"" but in the 30's.

As a personal aside, I served many years as a US diplomat in Communist China--another ruthless east Asian dictatorship.  Maybe some other viewers will find the Japanese officials in Blood on the Sun to be too fake, smarmy, and banal.  I found them pretty realistic!",1117497600,22,1702,4.616666666666666

Cagney receives a document spelling out the militaristic intentions of Japan formulated by Baron Tanaka.  The plan calls for the conquering of China as the initial step towards world domination.

When Cagney's top reporter and wife are murdered by the Japanese secret police, he realizes his own life is in danger.  With the aid of the exotic looking Sylvia Sidney, playing a Eurasian Chinese sympathizer and double agent, he endeavors to deliver the document to the American embassy in Japan.

I suppose the world climate at the time demanded this type of treatment to our hated enemies by Hollywood.  It was a bit too thick for me however",1110326400,,1005,5.24375

 James Cagney plays Nick Condon, managing editor of the Tokyo Chronicle.  It's 1920-something and the United States and Japan share an uneasy peace.  That peace threatens to be broken violently when the ""Tanaka Plan,"" a Japanese government document outlining a blueprint for world domination, falls into Condon's possession.  Condon has to get the document out of Japan and announce its contents to the world, the Japanese have to stop him.
 When I first saw  BLOOD ON THE SUN I shrugged it off as a piece of late-war propaganda.  There ARE a lot of stereotypical portrayals and attitudes coursing through this one- the Japanese are portrayed for the most part as buck toothed, diabolical schemers.  Cagney is attacked from behind twice in this movie.  The officials present trumped up charges in their attempt to stop his muck-raking ways.  The outrageousness of a foreign correspondent stealing and threatening to publish a secret state paper seems lost on this movie.  Then I did a computer search of  ""Tanaka Memorial"" and had a chance to read the document in question.  If it's not a forgery (the Japanese government claimed it was), it dwarfs the movie's presumptions.  As a side note, the web site I visited informs us that the Chinese, and not a crusading American editor, originally released the document.
  As usual, Cagney is a bundle of energy and is great fun to watch.  I've read that he took judo classes in preparation for this part, and it seems he's doing a lot of his own stunt work.  Sylvia Sydney plays Iris Hilliard, Cagney's love interest and someone interested in the document as well.  Soon after her character is introduced we learn she is half-Chinese, which should alert us to the fact that she isn't quite as sinister as she appears.  The Chinese were our allies during to the war.  They were the good Asians.  Another fun character in this one is Capt. Oshima (John Halloran), one of many Caucasian actors partially hidden behind false teeth and taped eyelids. Oshima is a menacing, murderous, towering brute of a cop.  Symbolically he's the first to attack the American Cagney with a karate chop from behind, a blow that knocks Cagney out.  Later, when the gloves are off and the two square off against each other in a fair fight the results are decidedly different.
 Wiard Ihnen & A. Roland Fields won a little statuette for Best Art Direction for their work on BLOOD ON THE SUN.  The sets do look pretty good.
 BLOOD ON THE SUN is in the public domain, so anyone can copy and sell it.  If you get the Delta version be warned that their logo will appear periodically in the lower-right hand corner.  They've included a short documentary (still photos with a voice over narration- yawn) and an intro and outro by Tony Curtis.  Unforgivably, Curtis tells us in the intro that Cagney plays a newspaperman ""right after World War Two.""  It may seem a minor point, but couldn't somebody on the set have reminded him that the movie took place after World War One?",1084492800,2,3074,4.732580037664784
456090,3,6302353750,"By 1945, the war in the Pacific was rapidly drawing to a close, and one would think that Hollywood would have presented a then contemporary view of America's relation with Japan.  Surprisingly enough, director Frank LLoyd harkens back to a pre-Pearl Harbor take on Japanese, which is to say that as far as Orientals were concerned, Charley Chan was mainstream America's image of the Asian.  It took the events of 12/7 to awaken America to a newer, more lethal yellow peril.  What is remarkable about LLoyd's BLOOD ON THE SUN is that nearly every one of the Asian characters is played by an American wearing some really bad makeup.  Since political correctness was non-existant then, no one seemed to mind the incongruous accents and eye makeup.  Into this mess of a national antipathy towards anything Japanese comes James Cagney, a Tokyo-based American news editor who somehow comes into possession of a secret Japanese document that outlines nothing less than a domination of the world by the Japanese emperor.  The plot revolves around efforts by the Japanese to regain custody of this document before Cagney has a chance to publicize it.  From a purely dramatic point of view, the interest of the film lies less in the race for possession of the document and more in a not so subtle expose of what passed for an anger towards all things Japanese.  Most of the Japanese were of the buck-toothed, slanty-eyed, grinning widely school of acting.  The only true oriental who radiated any genuine emotion was the Chinese veteran character actor Philip Ahn, who has made a career of playing rogues and coolies with an impressive depth of dignity.  Here Ahn has a bit part as a sadistic Kampetai (Japanese secret police) official who nevertheless gives a chilling performance as a officer who exudes menace with each soft-spoken word.  Most of the action revolves around Cagney who must navigate his way through a series of political roadblocks put there by those who may or may not be on his side.  Sylvia Sidney is a half-oriental woman with whom Cagney has an unlikely romance and is on screen mostly to give Cagney something to do when he is not being pursued by the local cops.  Early on, a hulking Japanese officer suggests that he would like a Judo match with Cagney.  Such subtle foreshadowing sets up a climactic grappling bout that is far more realistic than what is found in most chop-socky kung fu films.  The ending, of course, is sheer nonsense and bears as much resemblance to real world intrigue as, say, this movie.  Still, BLOOD ON THE SUN has its charm as long as one can plow through mounds of cinematic and ethnic implausibilities.",1067385600,,2648,4.812362030905077

Cagney lays down some classic lines and is invloved in a number of romantic moments which will make the ladies swoon (well, I did anyway).  Despite the fact that this is one of his later films, Cagney still bring to the film a certain sexiness and assertiveness that I have come to love him for.  Not to mention that he gets to throw a few punches!  If you are truly a diehard Cagney fan, this is a must see.",1063324800,,489,4.170212765957447

I initially purchased the video that claimed to be remastered. It could not be father from the truth, that video has extensive video, and something hard to find, sound noise. I did find pretty good quality in the issue from Hal Roach Studios/Image Entertainment.

7824827,4,6302353750,"This film won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction for Black and White films. It stars the forever-energetic actor James Cagney (1899-1986) who won an Academy Award himself in 1942 for Yankee Doodle Dandy. The American Film Institute named Cagney the 8th among the greatest male stars. The film Blood on the Sun was produced by James Cagney's brother William. The tile of the film may be based on Acts 2:20 - ""The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious Lord,"" suggesting that there would be many deaths in world War Ii before peace is restored. However, since Japan is associated with the sun, it may also refer to the fictional plot. It is just prior to World War II and a newspaper manager (Cagney) publishes a report that Japan plans to conquer the United states. The ""blood"" may refer to the many deaths that the ""sun,"" namely Japan, will produce.
In the film, the Japanese officials try to prove that the allegation is untrue. There is a signed paper that supports the allegation, and the Japanese want to acquire it and destroy it. Thinking that a man other than the manager had the paper, they kill him and his wife. When they later believe, correctly, that the man that they killed gave the paper to the manager, they go after him.
The film is good and Cagney is good as the newspaper manager.",1512518400,2,1363,4.522267206477733
