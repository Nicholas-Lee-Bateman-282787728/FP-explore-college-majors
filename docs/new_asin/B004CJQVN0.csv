8423147,5,B004CJQVN0,"What an eye-opening experience into the world of bees.  I'm sharing this with 200 friends/families.  I have worked in the animal care industry and have long suspected the impact pesticides have on our Eco-shpere.  I'm conducting a thorough investigation and research paper, and found this film among my ten academic sources (all dated within the past 10-years) to understand the endangered lives of the honeybees and specifically the colony collapse disorder.  Excellent film... also read or view the following:  The Beekeepers Lament, The Hive Detectives, Honeybee Democracy, Fruitless Fall, Bless the Bees, More Than Honey (film) and search for the organizations who support and understand how important honeybees are.  Consumers will vote at the grocery store... organic is the way to grow!",1398297600,,793,5.459016393442623
8423148,3,B004CJQVN0,"This film shows how exploited the bees have become in particular in the USA for the sake of the honey....which, incidentally & crucially is the bees source of food & energy to survive the winter months, & not for us at all!!
""Colony"" is more about the socio/economic business of bees & honey as well as the crisis of CCD but again, more in relation to the economy rather than the impact on the bees themselves.  Also, we get to see the bee farm of an Amish family & the effects of the USA economy on them....if that floats your boat, then it's a good film. If you are more concerned about the bees themselves, it's not so hot.

8423149,2,B004CJQVN0,"All the material about the Seppi family really wrecked this video. Not only was a lot of it dark and badly filmed but I got really sick of the family arguments, the prayer at the dinner table scenes, the arguments with almond growers about price and the scenes in church. What does religion have to do with CCD? I also hated the opening narration.

Without the Seppi family, I probably would have given a rating of 4 stars. There are a lot of great closeup shots of bees that I haven't seen anywhere else. The man with a face full of bees and a bee in his ear was a hoot. It's worth watching if you skip the Seppi family segments.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Queen-Of-The-Sun-What-Are-the-Bees-Telling-Us/dp/B005ZMBDJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Queen Of The Sun: What Are the Bees Telling Us?</a>&nbsp;is a much better video.",1380326400,3,873,5.372262773722627
8423150,3,B004CJQVN0,"Colony: The Endangered World of Bees, by Irish Film Board; 83 minutes,  2009

 The main menu provides 12 chapter icons that allow a teacher to click immediately to one section: Colony: Beekeepers; Colony Collapse Disorder; [California] Beekeepers Meeting; Blessing Farmers; Pesticide Problems; Economic Problems; Fighting to Survive; Meeting with Bayer; Difference of Opinion; Next Generation of Beekeepers; and the final Credits.

 To maintain its storyline on colony collapse disorder (CCD), it should have been edited to closer to 50 minutes. While the interspersed scenes from the religious Seppi family provide a narrative on the economic negotiations, this has nothing to do with CCD (aside from the lingering stress of future CCD providing uncertainty) and their family dispute adds nothing to the video's CCD theme and provides a major distraction for use in schools. Indeed, the 83 minute length will require teacher editing anyway.

 This video does avoid most non-science and does focus on the Bayer interface. Hackenberg and Mendes in particular are sympathetic figures although they are portrayed in more depth in ""Vanishing of the Bees.""

 Summary of concepts: The introductory statement that the honey bee is the most-studied organism aside from humans is incorrect, but this introductory hyperbole can be corrected by a teacher and is probably the only misstatement in the video; the Seppi family is introduced while describing the almond-bee dependency and this family has 1500 hives; big trucks bring in the cross-country beekeepers to the California almond groves in 2008; Dave Mendes describes the big operation; George Clutter uses a swarm beard [no explanation that they do not sting while swarming] while describing the honey bee stinger with a good view of the stinger being pulled out; Mendes explains the almond pollination connection; John Miller explains the flower parts; the rate at that time was $174/hive; Kevin Young then describes how CCD results in bees dying in just a few weeks; testimony from ""Ms. Honey"" (but also some clueless citizens, the only non-science in the video); Peltis, Mendes and Hackenberg all describe CCD and a lack of immediate direct connection to pesticides; brief excerpts from ""60 Minutes"" and other news; heartbreak of losing 600 hives; California beekeepers meeting with Mendes and Hackenberg conclude pesticides may lead to a ""train wreck""; farmers including Seppi family who built from the ground up and who live on faith; Randy Oliver discusses new diseases and parasites, points to inbreeding causing a genetic bottleneck; scriptures and Russian plot are dismissed.  Lengthy footage from the House committee hearing stresses need for science data; highlights how the issue can become political fast.  Bayer ad discusses need for protecting food supply; Bromenshank asks ""how do you assign costs""; Henderson stresses behavioral research has failed to show bad effects from these systemic pesticides; Seppi family watches Pres. Obama on TV stress the national economic picture and the need to make sacrifices to get through the recovery; Seppi family has tense negotiations on per hive fee with almond growers.

 Oliver states that we are not losing bees as much as we will be losing beekeepers; Bayer, Inc. representative defends ""Gaucho"" and has internal studies to defend that position and uses Penn. State data as well; excerpt of church and preacher and then an excerpt from a 1950s Moody Bible Institute film [not sure why] and family prayer; almond growers and Seppi's negotiate again and the family squabble is again aired; scenes of helicopter spraying and dead bees [guilt by association]; Bayer's David Fisher and beekeepers meet and Mendes presents a non-dogmatic and reasoned overview; discussion of simple feedback loops that may assault a complex natural system.  In an ironical turn, the Seppi family discusses how they have as big a family as ""God gives them"" [no mention is made that it is because of overpopulation that industrialized farming and insecticide use is necessary to prevent massive starvation].

 Final few scenes conclude with Hackenberg and Mendes. As in the other CCD videos, they are the ones who come off as the most reasonable persons with commonsense and a science attitude. Both of these beekeepers however are not optimistic about the future of their vocation.

 Two ""extras"" are attached, each with a still photo and brief biography of the directors.

 Also see the DVD videos: ""Nature: Silence of the Bees""; ""Vanishing of the Bees,"" and ""The Strange Disappearance of the Bees""; and the book ""Fruitless Fall.""",1371686400,7,4615,5.313186813186813
8423151,3,B004CJQVN0,"I was disappointed. I thought that we will die of hunger and here we are worried about the nuclear family not getting their price for the hives.
I was extremely irritated by the mother. Not supporting the son who is stressed and not giving her opinion openly.",1327881600,,259,4.531914893617022
8423152,5,B004CJQVN0,"A serious look at the ""bee industry"".  I've heard several different  variations as to what's wrong with those bees.
I've several bee-keeper friends.  They've bought gueens from China.......

Something is wrong in the bee world... This movie is really professional and goes from start to finish like flowing honey... Every bit was facinating to watch.  It was educational as well as entertaining.

I was wondering if the bees got tired of traveling 'cross country, over and over again in open rigs..... (Give it some thought...)

Anyway... this is a very good movie even if you don't have much interest in bees.... I don't and I sure enjoyed it!",1319932800,,644,4.907407407407407
