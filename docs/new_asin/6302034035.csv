7820959,5,6302034035,"This movie begins with Stan and Ollie in the employment office, waiting for any available job they can do.  Ollie happens to overhear that a butler and maid, preferrably a married couple, are wanted to host a swank party in town, immediately, and decides the two of them will take the job.  Stan is forced to put on female attire and a curly blonde wig, far from the first time he's dressed in drag in one of their movies.  This entire scene at the dinner party is a remake of their 1928 silent short 'From Soup to Nuts,' only Stan wasn't in drag in that one.  Mr. Vanderveer, the host of this party, is played by the great character actor Jimmy Finlayson, at his usual best.  However, things at this party don't quite go as planned, and the boys quickly find themselves out of a job.  They are reduced to working as street sweepers, and are sitting there on the curb, feeling sorry for themselves, lamenting how they're just as good as other people yet don't have the education to prove it, when they inadvertently foil a bank robbery.  The manager of the bank is eternally grateful, and when told the boys would like to get a higher education, rewards them by sending them off to Oxford.

Needless to say, the boys don't fit in very well at Oxford, and immediately fall prey to a bunch of student pranksters (among them the great character actor Charley Hall).  These two greenhorns are told to go through a shrubbery maze, which results in a classic scene.  Some people might feel that the bit towards the end, these two grown men being scared by one of the students dressing up as a ghost, is a little silly and unbelievable, but it really doesn't seem too farfetched or ridiculous.  After all, we know Stan and Ollie are like two overgrown little boys who don't inhabit the same type of world that more cynical and jaded adults do.  After they finally make it through the immense endless maze, these students deceive them some more, this time directing them to the dean's office, telling them these are their living and sleeping quarters.  One of these students even dresses up like the dean himself.  In the middle of their revelries and nightcap in the dean's room, the real dean comes in and is none too pleased, particularly after he finds out how this came to happen.  However, Stan and Ollie are not punished for their antics in the dean's quarters; they're taken to their own quarters while the guilty student is dealt with harshly.  This enfuriates the band of pranksters, who begin chanting their fight song as they march over to get revenge.

In their proper quarters, the boys meet the valet Meredith, who says he knows Stan, that his real name is Lord Paddington, and that he has quite a reputation at Oxford.  They deny this could be possible, but Meredith remains convinced.  The students are on their way to get revenge, the ominous chant getting louder and louder and closer and closer, when Stan leans out the window and promptly gets knocked on the head.  This causes an instantaneously personality change, and he takes on all of the characteristics Meredith was saying Lord Paddington had, complete with repelling the lot of unruly students.  This final section of the film is just classic, showing that Stan really was capable of being a serious actor (as well as showcasing his real British accent), and proving what committed fans have long known, that he's actually the smarter one and that Ollie is the slower and more childlike one.  The tables are turned and now Ollie is the one getting ordered around by his best friend, who is acting very intellectually superior and even quite mean and petty, such as telling him he's got two chins and calling him Fatty.  The ending of this film is one of my favorites of theirs, particularly since it shows just how genuinely they cared for one another, knowing that it wasn't acting and that they really were closer than brothers in real life as well.",1136764800,,3922,4.627705627705628

  While the first segment at ""The Vanderveer's""dinner party maybe overdone. It's still a perfect lead into the boy's
heroics in foiling the bank robbery and their trek to Oxford.
  The scenes at The Hal Roach Studio's idea of the vernible English Collage is funny and Stan's Transformation
(Via his memory loss)into Oxford most brilliant athlete and
scholar is Laurel's best acting performance.
  This film depends more on comic acting and a certain
ammount of farce. But it's still vintage L&H Nevertheless.

7820961,5,6302034035,One of their best films! I grew up watching this on TV and now I have it and can view it anytime I want.  Anyone who is a fan of these 2 great comedians should definitely have this film in their library.  There are some classic comedy episodes in this film that will bring back memories for some and open up Laurel & Hardy to a new generation of viewers.,1031184000,3,354,4.042857142857143
7820962,5,6302034035,"Arguably Laurel and Hardy's last funny feature, 'A Chump at Oxford' is the film where we discover that Stan is actually an amnesiac, who, before an accident, was the fabulously wealthy, intellectually pioneering, athletically record-beating, and very English, Lord Paddington.  Not only does Lord Stan thrash an army of malevolent Oxbridge undergrads (including a youngish Peter Cushing!), but he arranges luncheon with a certain Professor Einstein to straighten a certain theory the latter's been having trouble with.
The plot - after a series of disastrous menial jobs, the accidental foiling of a bank robbery sees the boys rewarded with the Oxbridge eduction they felt they were always lacking - is merely a flimsy structure on which to hang some classic, short-like sequences.  These are brilliant from the start - including an upper-class dinner party at which Ollie plays butler and Stan is the maid who gives a new meaning to salad without dressing.  The dark themes - Ollie and Stan going round in self-defeating circles; the intolerance of an uncomprehending world - are lightly developed.
But when the pair finally reach Oxford, the film achieves the sublime.  Being naive Americans, they are instantly ragged by the smarmy English undergraduates.  In the most amazing, frightening and central sequence, they are given wrong directions to the Registrar's - at the other end of a garden maze!  Going round in ever hopeless circles (fabulously visualised by trick editing so that they don't seem to leave the frame, despite walking out of it), with Stan at one point literally taking the exit with him, and Ollie burdened like an elephant with a huge trunk (of the suitcase variety), and two bags ('Get a grip!'  Stan places his on top!), they decide to spend the night in their prison.  Here they are pestered by a student dressed as a ghost - his disembodied hand, messing with Ollie's hankie and Stan's pipe, gives the film a chilling Surrealist frisson.
If this is the film's most resonant sequence, the two funniest are to come - the boys being tricked into treating the Dean's chambers as their own (and having a messy booze-up) and the gloriously weird Paddington set-piece, Stan enunciating a Wodehousean vocabulary and manically wriggling his ears.  The slow, patient, accumulative construction of comic crescendos is given plenty of space by the unobtrusive filming.",1013558400,3,2385,5.126288659793815
7820963,4,6302034035,"A CHUMP AT OXFORD, one of the team's final flicks for comedic soul-mate producer, Hal Roach, hasn't aged as well as some other Laurel & Hardy Features -- but it has several bits making it a must for comedy fans, aspiring comedians, or any young person just discovering this first class comedy team.  And these days you almost have to be on an expedition to find their movies, since many are no longer re-issued on video.
  A CHUMP AT OXFORD actually seems like several little movies edited together and, indeed, according to one account the dinner scene which opens this movie -- a reprise of a silent film comedy dinner scene -- was added later. No matter what the real behind-the-scenes story is, this scene, featuring the hilarious Jimmy Finlayson,  original creator of the ""DOUGH!"" popularized in recent years by Homer Simpson, is a scream.
  Still, this scene's supposedly big comedy payoff --  Stan coming out in his long underwear (after being told to serve the salad ""undressed""), causing scandalized women to faint -- is  outdated for today's audiences (younger ones will wonder what all the fainting is all about since the long underwear barely resembles what most people wear for underwear today).
  BUT there are three key reasons why you need to get this video:
1: STAN LAUREL'S UNUSUAL ROLE: When ""the boys"" thwart a robbery and are rewarded with paid education at Oxford and arrive in England, a bump on the head transforms Stan into the aristocratic, brilliant Lord Paddington.
  This not only gives viewers a glimpse of Stan Laurel's acting ability but perhaps gives a better view of the ""real"" Stan, who was no dummy (he was the brains behind many of the team's bits and helped edit a lot of the earlier, funnier movies). In his role as upper-class gentleman, the new Stan bosses around and verbally humiliates the usually dominant Hardy. This is one of the few movies where Stan aims a ""fat"" joke (as Lord Paddington) at Hardy.
  Hardy plays off against this new incarnation of a smart, bossy Laurel with sheer perfection. No comedy team has ever melded as one better than Laurel and Hardy. There truly was magic there (perhaps matched only by Jackie Gleason and Art Carney at their best).
  SPECIAL NOTE: when Stan wiggles his ears it was NOT done with special effects. He could do it.
2. THE LOST IN THE MAZE BIT: When L&H are lost in a maze, they sit down to rest. A student clad in a skeleton costume sneaks up behind them and puts his arms under their shoulders, using his hands as their hands while the completely out-of-it L&H try to smoke with ""their"" hands. It's hard to describe this comedy bit but the timing is so absolutely perfect and execution of this piece of nuttiness so seamless that you have to laugh loudly. This scene is worth the price of this video. Any comedy buff or aspiring comedian MUST view this short bit!!!
3. A YOUNG PETER CUSHING: Before all the horrors.
  Overall, the first half of the movie is funnier but the second is  more worthwhile, since nothing can possibly top the bit in the maze  -- or the startling transformation of dim-witted Stan into a Stan perhaps closer to the ""real"" Stan Laurel (who unlike Lord Paddington was reported to be a real sweetheart in real life by everyone who knew him).",1012003200,4,3257,4.670753064798599
7820964,5,6302034035,"A rich man pays for the boys to go to Oxford after he mistakenly thinks that they caught the man who robbed him. Upon their arrival, they become the victims of some practical jokes which  find them lost in a hedge-maze, and fixing cocktails while in the Dean's bed.  Later, Stanley gets hit in the head with some interesting results.
  ""A Chump at Oxford"" can't help but put a smile on your face!  No matter how many times I see it, this film remains hilarious.",1009670400,,461,4.376470588235295
7820965,4,6302034035,This is a true classic. This has been a family favorite of ours and I would like to see it re-released soon.,949449600,,108,3.9545454545454546
7820966,3,6302034035,"A CHUMP AT OXFORD was one of Laurel and Hardy's last films for producer Hal Roach.  Roach was losing interest in the boys by this point (he was occupied by his more ambitious features), so the film isn't top drawer, but  there's still plenty to enjoy.  A dinner party scene (reworking their  silent film FROM SOUP TO NUTS) has Stan and Ollie opposite two favorite  foils, Anita Garvin and James Finlayson.  Best of all is Stan's  transformation into the brilliant, haughty Lord Paddington.  Those who have  only seen Stan Laurel as the ""Stanley"" character will surely be  impressed by this performance.  Forrester Harvey is very amusing as Stan  and Ollie's valet as is Wilfred Lucas as the Dean.  Peter Cushing is highly  visible as one of the prankish students.  Hopefully, it won't be too long  for this film to be restored, remastered and released on videotape.",946252800,2,865,4.821917808219178
