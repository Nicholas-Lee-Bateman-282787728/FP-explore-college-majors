8316735,3,B001KZN2DG,Was really looking forward to a great sniper movie. It started out just fine but quickly evolved into a mediocre romance. OK to view once but not likely to be a regular feature in my home movie theater.,1432598400,,202,4.342105263157895

8316737,5,B001KZN2DG,"A superior film: superior cinematography (a blue light special: do what I want or you won't be paid) and superior cultural portrayal. Stressed out science fiction buffs might notice that Nicolas Cage's character resembles author Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation and Empire"" character The Mule.",1412294400,,287,5.6976744186046515
