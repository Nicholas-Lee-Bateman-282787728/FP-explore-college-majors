7952716,5,B00005RT37,"Yes, that's right. 5 Stars. I had to counter balance out the unfair ratings somehow. People put too much focus on movies ""changing the world"". If you want a film that's just about having fun [and rocking out] you've found it!

It has great one-liners, enjoyable characters, a simple enough plot and, quite frankly, this film will remind you that back before Twilight it was actually cool to like vampires, and none's cooler then our main man Eddie.

It's corny and goofy [it's a b movie, what do you expect] but overall a good time!",1488067200,,532,4.589473684210526

7952720,3,B00005RT37,"I'm mostly giving it a 3-star because of it's music (full list of songs at the bottom of the review).
It's not a good movie, it's watchable but it's hard to hear, so once again put on captions, otherwise you will miss a TON of dialogue. Reason? because there is a soundtrack playing the entire movie, and by soundtrack i mean full vocals, full band music, while people are talking with horrible audio recording. Seriously. Even the captions cannot decipher some of the dialogue
This movie has a really silly pun-filled premise, that fell flat a lot, there were definitely some pun-tastic scenes, but then it  riffs itself, while trying to be taken seriously. There's also a bunch of cliche 50's slang slathered over the script like butter on diner toast (that's not one of them. i'm just toast after this)
Lines like : ""You asked for it! it's gonna be a hard days night!"" "" Do i look like a squid to you?""  ""one semester does not a psychiatrist make!""

The Plot is basically about a girl named Iris, who is obsessed with Elvis, who works at a vintage store where she gets bothered by a guy nicknamed ""beatle boy"" who is obsessed with the Beatles, and wears a terrible wig and uses a terrible accent. She wrote a book about Elvis still being alive, and lives in an apartment she cannot afford, because her job and getting her book rejected constantly doesn't pay the rent. She meets a vampire who she thinks looks like Elvis (he doesn't) his name is Vincent. Vincent has a vampire brother named Wrecks, and his goon squad, who constantly find Iris and ask her where his brother is. Wrecks needs his brother so he can bite him again to make him his follower, sigh. Then there is this annoying landlord of Iris' and his annoying son.

The characters are likable/loath-able, the acting is like watching a middle school play, with plenty of pauses, blank stares, reacting before finishing or starting lines. It's a mess. But a almost ""good"" mess. It kept me watching, groaning and laughing , but it did also have me yelling at the plot to advance. Which it failed to do, a lot of random plot points that annoyed me. Bad wigs, and beatle boy (same thing)
Is it watchable, it is, if you like cheese, but rotten cheese that doesn't realize it expired.

(I'm only listening the soundtrack because it's not readily available online, and it was pretty much the most likeable part of the movie)

7952723,4,B00005RT37,"Greetings from Tromaville!
This is a good movie about a girl who is obsessed with Elvis. After breaking up with a one date ex-boyfriend who was obsessed with the Beatles, she developes a crush on an Elvis-lookalike who just so happens to be a vampire! Carnage ensues when the girl finds out about the Elvis-lookalike's brother who also just happens to be a vampire!
There are several other subplots and charectors that make this film very enjoyable. The DVD doesn't include as many extras as earlier Troma DVDs, but still much more than most DVDs on the market!  The film also contains several actors who were also in ""Tromeo and Juliet,"" so it's an interesting film for ""Tromeo"" fans to see!
