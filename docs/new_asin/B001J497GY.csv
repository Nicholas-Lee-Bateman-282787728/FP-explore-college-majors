8311822,5,B001J497GY,"I am now age 78 and can vividly recall the day Lenny took over from an ailing Bruno Walter and was such a success he was on the front page of the New York Times the next day.  I was raised on classical music and was a Bernstein fan from that time until his death in 1990.  I have a large collection of him conducting orchestras from all over the world.  However I had nothing to compare with the Anniversary DVD edition, beginning with Brahms 1st and continuing for 5 DVD's.
  I once wrote him a fan mail (many years ago) saying I hoped he would do more Broadway because of my love for West Side and - lo and behold - I received a lovely letter in response from his sister.
  Would that I had saved it.  God bless you Lenny wherever you are.  You will always be in my heart and I hope you somehow know that the world is
a much poorer place without you.",1240790400,8,852,4.023809523809524
