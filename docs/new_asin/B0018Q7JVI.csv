8270645,4,B0018Q7JVI,"This is my favorite workout in Tracey's Fit for Life Series.  I wouldn't categorize this as circuit training since my heart rate didn't stay elevated for most of the workout.  It's a fun total body workout though.  The workout is about 1 hour 12 minutes.

Why I enjoyed this workout:

**Tracey's personality.  She's very relaxed and looks like she's having fun.  She has a nice rapport with Barbie and Jill, the background exercisers. Because of this, I can't help but have fun too.

**Tracey's teaching style.  She's very good a giving form pointers.

**The motivating music that really fit the workout.

**The total body workout.  All my muscle groups felt worked out after doing this.

**The premixes.  You have the option of doing just upper or just lower body.  You also can do shorter total body mixes.

**The interesting backdrop.  I love the wood background.

Some things to note about this workout:

**It's not very intense.  My heart rate was elevated during a few of the leg sections, but that's it.

**The warm-up is off-beat from the music.  It's strange since the rest of the workout is on-beat with the music.  I liked the music so much, it didn't really bother me.

**Tracey and crew don't change equipment on screen.  I have to constantly pause the DVD to set up for the next circuit.  I suppose if I did this workout more frequently, I'd know how to set everything up ahead of time.

I use this workout during my rest weeks, when I want to work total body, but not too intensely.  I recommend this DVD over any of the others in the Fit for Life Series.  This series also includes: Strike Zone, Steady State Step, Hi/Lo Med Ball and Core Blast.",1305158400,5,1661,4.592465753424658
