This collection of 11 toons hosted by big toon head fan and movie critic, Leonard maltin, features Warner's unabashedly pro-american and ethno-centric cartoons of WWII.  Rarely, If Ever, do these pop up on TV anymore due to their stereotypes of Japanese and Germans.

That said these are some hilarious cartoons, brought to you by the holy trinity of Warner Bros. directors Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, and Chuck Jones.  Here are the highlights of the 11 toons:

""Herr meets Hare""  Hermann Goering heads to the Black Forest for rest and relaxation; because of a wrong turn in Albuquerque, so does Bugs, who encounters ""Fatso"" while trying to get to Las Vegas. Bugs taunts the Nazi, who captures him and takes him to Adolf Hitler, but Bugs gets the last laugh -- disguised as Stalin.  A Classic!

""Draftee Daffy"" - Daffy is fully behind the war effort until he is drafted. The man from the draft board attempts to deliver his notice as Daffy frantically avoids him, even by hiding in Hell. Unfortunately for Daffy, the Devil is the man from the draft board in disguise.

""DAffy the Commando""  -  Daffy is a commando who parachutes down into the German trenches to raise hell. Daffy bedevils the German commander, Von Vulture, and his sidekick, little helmet-with-two-feet Schultz, providing plenty of opportunities for anti-Nazi jokes along the way.  Von Vulture blows Daffy's plane to bits with a machine gun, and the commando is forced to flee on foot. He hides in a dark tunnel, which turns out to be the barrel of a long-range cannon. Daffy is shot out of it and lands in Berlin, where Adolf Hitler is shrilly haranguing a crowd. Daffy has the honor of clobbering the Fuhrer himself with a mallet.  Simply fantastic!!!

""Plane Daffy""  -  One after another of a company of carrier pigeons falls prey to the seductive wiles of ""Queen of the Spies"" Hatta Mari. The alarm is raised at pigeon headquarters when Pigeon 13 goes AWOL with the female Nazi spy bird, to whom he reveals all his secrets. Self-described woman-hater Daffy volunteers for the next mission, but has to swallow his secret message when the temptress corners him as well. After a frenetic battle at slinky Mari's pad, she X-rays the duck and broadcasts the secret (""Hitler is a stinker"") to Hitler, plus Goebbels and Goering- who have to shoot themselves through the head after agreeing with it.

While a couple of these WWII era toons do show up on Warners recent Golden collection DVD boxed sets, the best ones, those that deal directly with WWII and with Hitler and the other Axis powers, do not.  what a shame.  It would really be nice for Warners to release this set on DVD.",1103155200,11,2781,4.75625
