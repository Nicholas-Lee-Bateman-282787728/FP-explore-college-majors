8022179,5,B00024NVRI,"This a very realistic and true to the era production. I was pleasantly surprised - quite honestly, it really surpassed my expectations. This is a made-for-TV movie but the quality is as good, if not better than most wide-screen feauture movies. It is abundant in characters that are very well developed, except maybe for one - the political officer (?). Not that I would expect him to be either a ""good"" or ""bad"" guy, but the motivations of some of his actions were pretty unclear. But that was about the only thing I didn't like as much. Overall it is agreat and very powerful series, especially the last (fourth) part. ... One thing I particularly liked about this movie is that unlike most western movies, which have at most just two characters you care about, while other ""minor"" characters just provide a background, in this one you are equally concerned about everyone you see on the screen. You manage to catch individuality, what each represents, their emotions. I think it's amazing. You just never get bored even though it's more than three hours long.",1418601600,,1062,4.7771739130434785

The series has English subtitles. the score is beautiful. The quality of the subtitles is not perfect - some contain pretty serious grammar mistakes, bad choice of words, but most of them are ok.

I would recommend 'On a Nameless Height"" to everyone who is interested in World War 2 movies or antiwar movies in general. As far as I am concerned I even think it is worth having it in my DVD collection.",1097971200,2,1465,4.674418604651163
