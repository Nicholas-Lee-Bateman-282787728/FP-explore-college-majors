1897613,4,B00009Y3OV,"Video Quality is Fine.
Thoroughly enjoyed movie.
70 out of 100 for a Madsen movie plot and action.
Well worth 8 dollars",1328054400,2,119,4.454545454545454
1897614,1,B00009Y3OV,"There is a reason that Michael Madsen, an otherwise excellent actor, wears sunglasses in so many scenes of this movie -- he doesn't want anyone to recognize him in this God-awful cliche'-driven, corny, pathetic-acting waste of celluloid.  Aaaargh, how awful!  I watched it to the end just to see how bad it could possibly be.

The only redemption to the film is the Angel.  She is stunning, but unfortunately she was given the most cornball lines that it came across as such camp.  The storyline had potential, but the acting was just abysmal by Madsen.  And it's not that he's a bad actor, but why does he accept such crap roles!?!  He looks bored in every scene, as if he's praying for the scenes to be over so that he can go back to his trailer and drink thoughts and memories of this movie out of his head.

The bad guys were so cliche' that it was painful to watch.  They are all in black, and even though they are trained soldiers, during the countless shoot-out scenes (which go on and on forever), they couldn't aim their weapons to save their lives.  Quite ironic how the Angel who is appalled by the violence of men on Earth is such an amazing marksman.

The car chases, I have to admit, are well choreographed, but after about the 4th chase scene, it's enough already.  It's boning.  (And it's quite ironic that Madsen and Miss Hottie Alien can steal a Porsche but there are no Police out there to intervene in these car chases and possibly apprehend those who are driving a stolen vehicle.)

The little girl is actually one of the better actors.  Dyan Cannon and Robert Vaughn are simply NOT believable as husband and wife.  What, they've been married for 30 years, but when she betrays him (as an employee of ""The Company"" still), he doesn't even have any emotion about it.  C'mon!  Did the Director actually mandate, ""Okay, crew, you need to act as poorly as possible in these scenes.""!?!

Trash, camp, garbage, and a waste of my time.  I want my hour and change of my life back!  When I die and I have to review my life, I pray that this episode of my life, the viewing of ""The Sender"", is forgiven.",1295654400,7,2114,4.453125
1897615,4,B00009Y3OV,this was a very good movie for the 80's. has some good action in it.,1264982400,4,68,3.6
1897616,1,B00009Y3OV,"A star studded cast with beautiful sexy women wasn't enough to save this movie. With so many stuntmen out of work and Hollywood going broke its no wonder that aliens will do the jobs that earthmen don't want to do. If you saw E.T., Taken, Race to witch mountain and other recent alien/UFU movies you will find the same theme as this movie. Is that plagiarism? The movie begins with the famous incident in which planes from an aircraft carrier disappear in the Bermuda triangle. It's a repeat of sci-fi UFO movies with the addition of 2 dozen car crashes and a beautiful Latino alien with healing powers who is trying to cure a cute little girl of cancer who only wants daddy and go back home. The movie follows the same plot as the sci-fi Taken -- with men in black and the pursuit of the father and his kid by the army did not keep me on the edge of my seat. Our alien not only abhorred the violence of earth men but also is adept at killing mankind with an army pistol. I would spoil the ending if I could but fell asleep after I fed my cat and swept my kitchen floor. Our little girl of course is a jump in the evolution of mankind due to aliens from outer space and has powers being sought by the military. Save you money and rent the movie Taken.",1256860800,5,1251,4.195020746887967
1897617,4,B00009Y3OV,"For a B movie this one is very enjoyable. It is a car chase movie with a sci fi plot about a young girl that is a Sender. She has the power to move ships through interestelar space. Like Frank Herbert's Dune navigators but more pretty. So, the big bad government guys want her and the aliens protect her. I give the movie three stars for the entertainment value and five stars for the lovely Shelly Lether who plays the alien girl. She is out of this world.",1193702400,10,457,4.204545454545454
1897618,1,B00009Y3OV,"This is an unbelievably awful piece of work. I only looked it up on the internet after a Christmas game of ""what's the worst film you've ever seen?"". It never even made it to the big screen in the UK, and makes no mark on the film guides.

I saw it in a cinema in The Middle East, where there was nothing better to do. Even though it was 7 years ago, I can still recall the pointlessly shallow evil of the baddies, the dreadfulness of the acting, terrible, terrible special effects, a plot that makes Police Academy 6 look like Fellini's 8 1/2, and the feeling of disbelief at yet another dip in the already-low quality of what was set before us.

It was so bad that it was a relief when someone's mobile rang as it gave us some decent dialogue to listen to. ""The Sender"" made me want to join a sect that would brainwash me into forgetting, or at least prevent any 20th Century influences from harming me. It is so bad that now, when I watch ""Reservoir Dogs"", it's not as good as it used to be. If Michael Madsen tried to cut off my ear, I'd let him if it meant I didn't have to listen to any more of his dialogue. I'd ask him to poke my eyes out while he was at it though.",1104278400,7,1173,4.051724137931035
1897619,4,B00009Y3OV,"I enjoy watching this movie. I woke up at 4AM to tape this movie on Cinemax years ago. I just wish for a reasonably-priced VHS for sale or, even better, a Region 1 DVD release...
This movie may be a little cheesy at times, but I really enjoyed it. The special effects are great and (i believe that) the story is closer to fact, especially concerning the ""sender"" gene...

1897639,2,B00009Y3OV,Awful movie. Bad acting and writing. Car chases were repetitive. I gave it two stars because the little girl was cute. Maybe she has a future in a better movie.,1512691200,,160,4.366666666666666
1897640,1,B00009Y3OV,"We are only given so much time here on Earth, so save some precious moments by not watching this ridiculously awful movie.  I lost fifteen I can never get back...  Horribly researched and written, WWII fighters in 1965, one pilot's helmet was down over his eyes it fit so bad, a car in a chase scene is launched into the air and spins after hitting cardboard boxes, and diesel fuel EXPLODES in a fireball big enough to engulf a semi trailer.

1897641,1,B00009Y3OV,"I started this on Prime, but never bothered finishing watching it. A truly dreadful movie. Terrible overacting, incoherent plot, and and the story just generally pointless.

1897644,1,B00009Y3OV,I haven't been that bad to punish myself by continuing to watch the movie until the end . Bad everything ! I really don't know how anyone could give this more than a one star rating . they should be drug tested !,1510012800,,212,3.953488372093023
1897645,1,B00009Y3OV,"Wow, this really is a stinker! Ridiculous script, terrible effects, horrible acting, no real directorial work done whatsoever, just a badly assembled series of shots stitched together. Oh, and absolutely the worst soundtrack I've ever encountered in a motion picture. If lots of mumbling, fighting with sunglasses on and tons of cars getting wrecked for no apparent reason is your thing, look no further... Honestly- this picture gives B movies a bad name.

Time frames are all wrong. Corsairs in the 60s, 70s cars in the late 80s along with Lexus SUV. Cartoon violence accompanying minimal acting, not much to this dog B film.

1897682,1,B00009Y3OV,"As someone who has opened a history book or 2 in my life, and who served in the US Navy I was immediately turned off by the glaring anachronisms in this movie. It starts off with the caption that the year is 1965 then cuts to a squadron of WWII F4U Corsairs which the Navy stopped flying right after 1945 that supposedly encounter an alien spaceship over the Bermuda Triangle. Then we jump to soldiers armed with M-14's which only started trickling into use in 1967. The acting is horrible, and all the stunts like driving through a stack of empty cardboard boxes, and wrecking only beat the most beat up junkers they bought at a police auction and painted with rattle cans from Walmart just look so cheaply done that it looks like a senior thesis movie for a film school kid.

My capacity to suspend disbelief is pretty good, I like action movies and I've witnessed more than one presidential election.  But, this movie basically opened with a concerted effort directly against the suspension of disbelief.  No subtle blend of reality and fantasy here.  Right off the bat we are treated WWII era CGI F4Us flying patrol in the 1960's.  It's that lack of care that makes this film really bad.  Save yourself a headache, skip this movie.

Two people with two guns with inexhaustible ammo taking out dozens of trained military men is beyond belief.

A lot of things go unexplained or are quite impossible, like the heroes of the story having guns with 'never ending' bullets. Think of this as the 'Olive Garden' of B movies made for TV.
