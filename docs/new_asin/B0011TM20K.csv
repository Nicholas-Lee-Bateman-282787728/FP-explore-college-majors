However, keep in mind that this video course does not teach you how to prepare for a 5-K, 10K, half marathon or a full marathon. That requires more research on your part. The good news is, you can find those videos on Youtube. In fact, you may be able to find many of these workouts on Youtube (with different names of course). Even though there are over 100 exercises in this program, they are basically different methods (with different names) to sculpt the whole body. For instance, there are over 10 different exercises to sculpting the abdominal muscles and the back. It is basically 2-3 workouts but emphasized with different variations and modifications. This video is taught by coach Christian Smith, a former elite track & field runner from K-State. Overall, I find it very helpful for prerun and postrun exercises.

Do I recommend it? Not really. Most of these exercises you can easily find online.",1293148800,,1035,4.814606741573034
8242281,3,B0011TM20K,"The video is a demonstration of various exercises.  If you want a workout that you can follow along -- then you need to constantly hit the pause button, do your reps, then hit play to go to the next exercise.  The exercises are very good, but I wanted a workout that I could mindlessly follow along.  It is annoying to hit pause and try to figure out how many reps to do.  It would have been easy for the producers of this video to give various follow-along workouts.  Maybe next time.",1268179200,8,485,4.285714285714286
