3614546,5,B001GLLLFK,"Although an orchestral musician or conductor, from school days to near-retirement, I've always enjoyed working with talented guest artists; the week-end that Victor Borge came to town as a guest soloist with our local symphony, however, was exceptional!  Seated in the octet of string players closest to the piano I was intrigued with his antics and really didn't know what was going to happen next.  What an artist and comedian - it makes me smile to remember that wonderful week-end. I'm anxious for my musical grandchildren to witness his extraordinary wit and talent!",1236556800,,571,5.129032258064516
3614547,5,B001GLLLFK,"My title says it all.  Most dvds you have to set aside for a year before you watch them a second time.  The Victor Borge Classic Collection is the exception.  I've watched it with friends, then again with other friends and again with even other friends and each viewing is as enjoyable as the other.
Victor Borge is himself a classic and his humor is timeless.  Seeing him in person many, many years ago has been one of my outstanding memories.  I only got tickets for it because my parents wanted to see his ""Comedy in Music"" on Broadway.  God bless my parents for that.  Fortunately, the Classic Collection gives almost the same feeling as being there.",1236124800,,654,4.538461538461538

I love Victor Borge.  He is a timeless and singular talent, not just a comedian, but an exceptional pianist, and the only comedian who can work any crowd even across a language barrier (watch his stuff in Danish on YouTube...even if you don't understand what he's saying, it's still hilarious).

The DVDs are filled with the best bits of his comedy: the Opera Singer, the Timid-Page Turner, Phonetic Punctuation, Inflationary Language, and more.  My favorite piece (besides Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody duet with the Turkish fellow performed on one piano) is his rendition of a Mozart opera.

These DVDs do overlap quite a bit, but that just means you can pull any DVD out and watch it and get most of his funniest routines.  Excellent buy for the amount of footage you get-and you can share it with your whole family, or even the kids next door-maybe they'll learn some proper English from the Great Dane.",1235520000,4,1084,5.660493827160494
3614551,4,B001GLLLFK,"There is a lot of overlap between the different dvds. Each dvd seems to have something that the others don't, but they also have a lot of the same routines. But given its price, it wasn't a bad deal.",1235088000,27,199,4.128205128205129

3614553,5,B001GLLLFK,"I recently purchased the Victor Borge Classic Collection about a week ago. Just the other night we were having some families over, so I decided to put on The Best of Borge. I do not remember seeing so much laughter and smiles in one room before. I was most suprised that even the teenagers who had never heard of him before were sitting down to watch. Victor Borge is a one of a kind performer that only comes along once in a lifetime. I have seen him live and on TV, and even though I know what he is going to say, I still laugh. His comedic timing and touch at the piano are legendary, and something you never get tired of seeing or hearing. I know you have heard it before, but this is truly a gift the whole family will enjoy forever! A must for everyone's holiday list!",1228176000,56,774,4.166666666666667

3614587,2,B001GLLLFK,"Of the six DVDs only the one titled ""The Best of Victor Borge - Acts One & Two"" is worthwhile and is even worth the money. However, the other five should just be thrown away because they are partial repeats of ""The Best..."" or are BAD copies of his old TV shows.",1456790400,,262,4.0576923076923075

3614716,4,B001GLLLFK,"If you're new to Victor Borge but are a little bit adventurous with your budget (just a little bit), I can recommend this set. Yes, some material is unnecessarily included in slightly different forms (not actual clip duplications, but some of the same routines are included on multiple DVDs). So why get this set? It'll be less legwork for you later. This is by no means a complete, all-encompassing set. Yet when you consider that Amazon now charges $4 per item in shipping (remember, Amazon doesn't combine shipping on the inexpensive USED items that most people seek out), you only need to be interested in a few of these to make it an equal value on your wallet. There's just enough different material to make it worth it, at least in my opinion. ""Acts One & Two"" (which I have reviewed separately) is worth watching, as is ""Then & Now."" The two ""Lost Episodes"" discs don't necessarily give you earth-shattering new material, but a fair bit of what's included *is* less familiar to some people.

Why the devil they needed to pad this set out to be 6 discs is beyond me - perhaps it was just the profit bug delivering its bite. A word of caution: since much of this footage is very old and mediocre archival film, the picture and sound quality were only going to be so good (especially on the 1950s-era portions). I would remind everyone that even the best audio/visual tech advances these days cannot correct poor original quality. If grainy film and various background sound noises bother you, don't buy it. I have seen enough old movies to know that nothing here is unacceptable in comparison. These are never going to get the sparkling high definition Blu-Ray treatment because some of them really can't be restored much beyond what you see here.

As long as you buy a used set, this is a decent value and will require less hunting (these were available as 6 individual releases long before they got the idea to stick them all into a box set). I only see 4 of them (the ones I mention above) as being anything near compulsory viewing. But since you would pay $16 for the shipping alone (at least on Amazon) to buy the 4 of them separately, a moderately-priced used set won't feel like an unbearable moneygrub. Conversely, if you're new to Victor and want to be cautious, then just go buy one or two individual DVDs and consider yourself spared from unnecessary expense. I snagged this set for $8 and considered that amount to be a good investment for my personal collection.

5 stars for Victor, but take away a star for the bloated feeling of this set (which some people will, understandably, call a repackaging at best or a rehash at worst). If I didn't adore this Dane's comedy so much, I might have subtracted TWO stars, but I don't have the heart to do that.",1387065600,,2770,4.580645161290323

Disks Five and Six are taken from the Pontiac Television Show in the late 1950s. It even shows a brand new 1958 Pontiac on stage (since Pontiac was the sponsor.) Victor supposedly drives it. They even go so far as to show Victors kids driving their own LITTLE Pontiac electric car. Worth viewing. Overall, Great Stuff. However, there is a lot of repeats of exactly the same things.

Disc 3 A complete rehash of the content found on Disc 1 and Disc 2.
Disc 4 Offers a good amount of new content in a look to the past review which repeats a few segments.  Great dueling piano skits.
Disc 5 This is a 1958 show which only repeats one skit I believe.

3614744,4,B001GLLLFK,"Victor Borge is as others have said one of the funniest men ever.  His humor is clean, clever, thought provoking and to top it off, hilarious.  Also as others have said, while the set is good, there is a lot of repetition.  I'm not sorry I bought it and would do so again.  I just watch the various disks spread out over time as so much is what has been done on the previous disks.",1335139200,2,381,4.04

3614746,3,B001GLLLFK,"As a big fan of Victor Borge, I was quite happy to find this set at Target for $20.

That said, after viewing the six discs, there is a lot of repeating of material. Others have mentioned that it could have been trimmed down to a smaller set and I agree with them. If I had paid $30-$50 I would have been upset.

At $20, I can live with that.

My advice is either wait until it drops in price or pick it up at Target.",1323907200,,417,3.8255813953488373

3614748,3,B001GLLLFK,"The condition of this item is excellent.  However, I am very disappointed with this product.  I watched the first DVD and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The next two DVDs were nothing more than rehashes of the first one, with some early footage of the exact same skits thrown in.  I have not seen the last two DVDs; but as far as I am concerned, this product is a rip-off for the buying public.",1300579200,4,391,4.388888888888889
3614749,4,B001GLLLFK,"I can't say enough about the skill of Victor Borge at both performing piano and entertaining via comedy. He's a true genius.

The collection itself, however, leaves a little to be desired. My only complaint (and thus, the reason I only gave it 4/5 stars) is that the DVD's seem a bit redundant; most of them contain the Marilyn Mulvey scene (the exact same version of that scene), and many also contain the Phonetic Punctuation (albeit, one of his funniest acts). However, I would prefer a little more diversity; normally when purchasing a collection like this, one would expect to see something entirely different on each DVD. Otherwise, highly recommended, as I know of no better collection at the moment.",1293926400,3,707,4.891666666666667
3614750,2,B001GLLLFK,"Victor Borge deserves 5 stars.  The producers, however, are charlatans who took one disc worth of material and duplicated it into 6 discs.  If you can get a used copy for cheap, then it is worth it as Borge is really very funny and charming.  $10 would be a fair price for this product.",1290729600,17,286,4.2592592592592595
3614751,5,B001GLLLFK,"I was listening to my XM Radio on the way to work one day - one of the comedy channels - and heard an old routine which I recognized as Victor Borge from when I was a kid.  I laughed out loud and really enjoyed my drive to work!  On a whim during a break I did a search on Amazon and found this DVD set and ordered it immediately!  It is WONDERFUL!  Victor was a great performer - both musically and comedically and it's been a pleasure to watch these DVDs.  Amazon's service was, once again - impeccable!",1289692800,,505,4.0606060606060606
3614752,3,B001GLLLFK,I found that once you saw the first DVD the rest were just about the same with only a few differences.  He did so much it is a shame that the DVD's had to be repeats.,1287446400,4,166,3.611111111111111
3614753,3,B001GLLLFK,Borge is great but the content of each DVD is largely the same. The boxed set could be easily reduced to two discs,1286236800,4,114,4.0
3614754,4,B001GLLLFK,"I would rate this 5 stars for Victor Borge's comedic ability and musical genius, but would rate the format by the producers a two and a half.  There is a lot of duplication of the skits, but even in those duplications they are taken from different performances so you see a few differences in the skits.  In fact from Act One & Two there are most of the skits you see in the rest of the discs, (yes there are new skits in in later discs), but you do notice for example the The Timid Page Turner, (his son Ron), is younger in Act One & Two and older in the duplicate skits from the other discs.  Even though they do show the same skit from the same performance on duplicate discs and those could be eliminated at either new, (previously unseen), material used or the set shortened to three or four longer discs.",1280448000,,810,4.246753246753247
3614755,1,B001GLLLFK,"Despicable! 412 minutes! 6 DVD disks! You have around 30 minutes of real good stuff. The other 350+ is exactly the same thing with different trolls commenting. Half DVD disk would be more than enough for all of it. I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel like I was robbed, fooled, disrespected. You may pay $29.99 now but the original price, which sold a lot, was way more than that. Victor Borge was a brilliant artist but this ""Collection"" is a real rip-off. Shame on the production company.",1278460800,12,501,4.456521739130435
3614756,5,B001GLLLFK,"When I was young, I watched Victor Borge with my parents whenever he came on a PBS special.  With this set, I can share the laughter with my own kids, and my wife who had never seen him before.  Borge has successfully crossed to another generation!

So far we've only watched 2 of the DVDs, and they were great.  Another review mentioned that there is a lot of duplication.  I haven't seen any yet.  But even if there is, this is well-worth the price!  Compared to one DVD movie that sells for $20, this is hours of family entertainment that everyone - yes even the teenagers - can watch again and again!",1276646400,,604,4.339285714285714
3614757,3,B001GLLLFK,"I recently purchased this item and after watching the first 3 I was dissapointed to see almost the same stuff on every DVD (I have yet to watch the other 3).  All the highlights do is list some of the acts not noted on the other discs.  If you purchase this expecting something not seen on PBS (as I did) you too might be disappointed.  Had I known what I was getting I would have purchased some other DVD's of something I have more interest in instead.  For the price I suppose it isn't a bad deal (about $3.33 for each dvd plus tax).  That said, I do enjoy his Phonetic Punctuation and Inflationary Language and there are others.

3614760,2,B001GLLLFK,"I enjoyed the first two DVDs I listened to, but the set is too big because they are very repetitive.  Borge was active so long that I thought the collection would be broader than it is.  I loved him when I was young and still do, but the collection could have been half this large and accomplished the same thing.",1265155200,3,313,4.2
3614761,3,B001GLLLFK,"I love Borge but this ""collection"" is not what I expected. The advertised hours of footage are repetitive. Each disc has nearly similar routines as the last.

3614784,1,B001GLLLFK,There is so much duplication on each of the DVDs they could have put everything once on one DVD and at least you would not feel ripped off. So many skits and hours of his comedy I was expecting to enjoy on all these DVDs and found that in this one DVD set I saw more re-runs of the same thing than I have ever seen. What a great disappointment but at least I could give out 5 of the DVDs to friends and we all would have the same thing just in a different order.,1261526400,38,462,3.8229166666666665
