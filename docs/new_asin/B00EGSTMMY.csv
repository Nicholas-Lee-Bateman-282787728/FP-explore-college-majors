8605196,4,B00EGSTMMY,"I received this video set as a gift, which I requested after reading her book ""Classical Dressage."" I have, over the years, mostly been disappointed by training videos, but I wanted to see horses performing the exercises she talked about in her book, and on that level, the videos are quite helpful. However, I can not help but be concerned  that if you did not read the book first, or already have a pretty good understanding of classical exercises, whether you would be able  to really understand the material presented in these videos, (which is why I gave 4 stars rather than 5).  The horses, riders, and facility are all first rate and so beautiful, it is a joy to watch, and the production quality is very good. I did feel a little frustrated by the narrator, who talked over the explanations that were being given by the actual trainer (Manuel Jorge de Oliveira) as I would have much preferred to have heard what he had to say rather than the narrator's interpretation!  But, in spite of its few shortcomings, I do recommend the series, as every effort was made to include a great deal of information for dealing with different kinds of horses at different stages of training, and is a great contribution to getting dressage back to its roots of calmness and natural beauty which is so lacking in today's competition dressage.",1454630400,7,1333,4.683760683760684
