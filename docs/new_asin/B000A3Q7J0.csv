2356589,1,B000A3Q7J0,"As another reviewer indicates, this is truly terrible stuff, an embarrassment to the cast for sure.  It's as if the writer-directors shared the same persuasive agent, and somehow the project, despite the amateurish scripts, had great early word-of-mouth, and the actors said ""yes.""  Poor them.  It wants to be a contemporary, British Twilight Zone, and misses by a mile because of the twin evils of dreadful writing and directing, on every single vignette.  My copy goes straight to ebay.",1134259200,18,488,5.139240506329114
2356590,1,B000A3Q7J0,"I bought this DVD because it had several fine actors in it, Cate Blanchett, Hugh Jackman, Paul Bettany. I have only watched 3 of the 6 short stories which were so poorly made, poorly photographed & directed that I wonder why such good actors participated in them. Awkward, look like home movies.",1127952000,8,295,4.6923076923076925
2356591,4,B000A3Q7J0,"When the blurb about this DVD says it has an all-star cast, it's not kidding.  Each of these short vignettes has not one but several bona fide stars, from Cate Blanchette as a young woman coming unglued over dinner to James Gandolfini as a man waking up from a drunken stupor to find that his wife has left him and, quite literally, taken EVERYTHING.  I have to admit that I didn't expect much at all from this DVD, in part because I'd never heard of it and in part because it came from the bottom of the bargain bin at Wal-Mart.  However, it really is surprisingly good.  The vignettes themselves are a bit uneven - my favorites were ""Standing Room Only"" (a wordless, nearly slapstick piece starring Hugh Jackman) and ""Euston Road"" (a short and clever tale of a down-on-his-luck gambler who isn't quite what he seems).  Even if there are only a few of the pieces that you really, really enjoy, for the $5 used DVD price, you can't go wrong.  Give Stories of Lost Souls a try.",1123545600,23,976,4.424581005586592

8074060,4,B000A3Q7J0,"Its what I expected......several 10 minute or so stories about peoples lives.....I bought it since a very young Cate Blanchett is in it, her story written by ber husband Andrew Upton......its different alright.",1471046400,,210,5.393939393939394
8074061,1,B000A3Q7J0,How truly disappointing these reviews are! But here is MY question...wtf is up with that first reviewer??? He/she seemed to love it! That just goes to show ya how some critic reviews end up the way they do!,1431388800,,206,4.447368421052632

8074064,1,B000A3Q7J0,"With all of the talent in this production I thought I couldn't lose. I was wrong. The actors (particularly Gandolfini and Knightley) did their part. It was the plots that were lacking. Too choppy, not enough time to care about the characters. Too bad, waste of great talent.",1246147200,,274,4.729166666666667
8074065,1,B000A3Q7J0,"This was a complete waste of time and money.  Not recommended for viewing. Deborra-Lee Furness could have done much better, and to say her short was the best of the DVD, isn't saying a great deal.  Sorry but a big dissapointment.",1235347200,,229,4.560975609756097
8074066,3,B000A3Q7J0,"This movie lacks so many things. Each story in it is very mediocre and i disliked most of them even though i love Keira Knightley, Hugh Jackman, and James Gandolfini. The best two scenes i thought were Jackmans and Gandolfinis but other than that this movie is rather bad and a waste of money if you are a fan of anyone in it.",1212105600,,326,4.190476190476191
8074067,1,B000A3Q7J0,"In every story, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never did.  The description on the DVD sounded like they should be scary, or at least a little twisted, but nothing ever really happened.  As the other reviews say, the actors talent is wasted.",1150675200,10,268,4.680851063829787
