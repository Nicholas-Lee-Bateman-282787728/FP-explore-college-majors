7343957,1,B0128P1JF4,"Tony Anthony is my all-time faverite Spaghetti Western star ,but this was the stupidest most idiotic Western ever . How do you justify Vikings and Cowboys,and Moores in the same movie . It was so bad I did not even finish watching it. Please put some of his better films up for streaming, like A Stranger In Town , The Stranger Returns , and The Silent Stranger  , or even Commin At YA",1453766400,2,385,4.273972602739726

7343959,5,B0128P1JF4,"Get Mean combines elements of  mysticism (inspiration for Brisco County's orb?), history, and action to provide a roller coaster journey through time. The American cowboy, the Stranger, seen in three previous films, is deftly played by Tony Anthony with wry humor, charisma, and sex appeal. The Stranger has been hired to take a Princess home to her rightful throne. So, he storms Spain with Princess in tow, an irresistible force about to meet immovable objects of all kinds he hadn't planned on. Landing smack-dab in the middle of a battle between Barbarians and the Moors, he must protect the Princess and try to separate the good guys from the bad guys. After being hung by his heels, shot with a cannon, chased by a bull, and tormented by demons (for starters) he must take on a whole fortress full of desperadoes. He only has his wits (and a lot of cool ammunition) to survive, deliver the Princess, earn his fee, and finally be able to go home to America.

Blue Underground has done a remarkable job with this box set. The extras and clarity of the transfer show the great care and respect that they showed this film.

First rate production values, cinematography, and direction. A real surprise.",1446508800,7,120,6.117647058823529
8725650,2,B0128P1JF4,"Ya know, this is a pretty crummy film, all told but it's fairly well restored (given the original elements) and the package of extras is very good.  Disjointed, predictable, messy direction from Baldi doesn't help.  Anthony is a strange strange lead in this one (not without interest because he is also 'disjointed, predictable and messy."")  Raf does pretty well playing the Richard 3 baddie, but everyone else is fairly lame or just impossibly underwritten.  Is it worth buying and watching? Yeah, if you can get a deal it's worth it to have in a collection because of the extras, why not?  In the end, the conceit of using 'historical' armies, is just not stupid enough.  And the funny is not that  ""fuh-knee."" In fact, for me the whole film would benefit enormously from being more extremely disjointed, predictable and messy.  2 1/2 stars.",1473465600,,843,4.846153846153846
8725651,4,B0128P1JF4,"Blue Underground has released Tony Anthony's unclassifiable hoot , Director Ferdinando Baldi's 'GET MEAN'- 1976  in the Blu-Ray format and though it may not be for everyone's taste, it definitely doesn't bore the audience.  Made at the end of the Spaghetti Western genre, the makers pull out all the stops by merging sword and sandal, supernatural and action genres into the Western format.  It could be included as the fourth Stranger film that Anthony was known for but it also could be any character.  As the film opens, you know you're in for an over the top foray as our Stranger is dragged full frame by a horse through an arid landscape finally arriving in a deserted ghost town and untied by a band of gypsies who make him an offer of $50,000 to deliver a royal princess back to Spain.  Along the way their are Moors, Barbarians and a hunchbacked lord played by Producer Lloyd Battista who spouts Shakespearian lines from 'RICHARD III'.  If you park your mind at another end of the room your watching in, you just might enjoy the mayhem for the film never allows you to catch your breath and soak in the absurdity of it all.  You'll recognize familiar faces such as beautiful Diana Lorys, Raf Baldasarre, and Mirta Miller in the mix.  The disc is loaded with extras with an extensive audio commentary with Producers Tony Anthony, Lloyd Battista , and Ronald J Schneider, interviews with Tony Anthony who has some wild stories, Lloyd Battista who remarked that they used some of the sets left over from Director John Guillerman's 'EL CONDOR' -1970, Producer Ronald J Schneider and Director Ferdinando Baldi which is in Italian with English subtitles. It has the original American and French theatrical trailers, radio spots and a poster and stills gallery.  There is also a DVD version included in the package. Both Blu-Ray and DVD's are presented in English with optional French and Spanish language tracks as well and both are presented in 2.35 ratio's.  Not a great movie by any means, it is a testament to the talents of Director Baldi and Tony Anthony that they pulled this off as well as they did.  It is a limited edition so this rarity will not be around for long.",1466812800,2,2179,4.707894736842105
