Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",1257206400,,416,4.791666666666667
8118563,5,B000F7CE0W,"I loved Every One Loves Raymond.  In many ways Rays family is just a little like everyone's family.  Families are filled with weird personalities who love each other all the time but we never know how much till we get on each others last nerve!  Of course the family dynamic is compressed to fit into the 21 minute time frame of half hour sit com's so one can hardly expect Tolstoy.  Nice thing is that over the years as the episodes mount up you begin to enjoy the characters as fully fleshed out individuals.

This is an enjoyable family to visit.  You feel like a friend invited in to the home of a nice italian family where you as an honored guest have a ring side seat from which to watch the hyjinks.  Usually when you  watch a TV show it is you the viewer who invites the TV family into your home and by tuning in while technically that is still true.  Everyone Loves Raymond often feels as if they have invited you into their home and there is little pretense you get to see all the good natured fun.

Love in any family is not as neat and tidy as was the case in 1960's TV.  Ray and his family show us Love has its share of warts and failings but in its way thats what makes real love awesome.  The people in your life that youo truly love with all your heart you love warts and all.  If Everyone Loves Raymond has a theme running through all its shows that was it and thats why I brought all six episodes no matter what they cost.

Oh I checked buying the 6 individual episodes was a few dollars more expensive than buying them sperately.  At the time I brought all six episodes this was the bargain price at $199.00 compared to $217.00",1146700800,3,1646,4.197452229299363

On a standalone basis, I rate the show 3.5-4 stars. It is an enjoyable comedy however I am taking the liberty of assuming that you are familiar with the show. If you are not familiar with the show, I have included a brief synopsis at the end.

I simply do not understand this. As of this review date, it is possible to buy all the six seasons separately from Amazon.com a lot cheaper than this compilation. To the best of my knowledge one is supposed to get a discount for bulk purchase (i.e. buying all six seasons together instead of purchasing them separately) and not pay a premium (as is the case here). To note, this is a compilation of the six seasons as they came out separately with no additional features (i.e. one will not be getting any extra features from this compilation that is not available in the individual seasons if bought separately). So by paying approximately US$ 40 extra, your additional gain is a thin see-through shrinkwrap which successfully holds the separate six season boxes together during shipping! Your call.

Briefly, this is about a man named Raymond (beautifully portrayed by Ray Romano), who is a sports columnist by profession. He is married (Debra - portrayed by Patricia Heaton) with 3 kids. His parents live across the street. Raymond's mother (Marie - portrayed by Doris Roberts) is always critical about Debra. Peter Boyle as Frank (Raymond's dad) is outstanding. However the undoubted star of the show is Brad Garrett as  Robert, the jealous elder brother of Raymond. Overall great cast of performers that knew their characters and excelled at them.

The show deals with real life problems and the characters are pretty realistic. Almost always it is possible to identify with or laugh at the amusing family situations (with a quick silent prayer that it never happens to oneself). It's family life with all the pluses and minuses, all the love and frustration, and all the individual eccentricity.

A good show that one should probably check out. Recommended if you are a comedy lover.",1144281600,5,2161,4.8297297297297295
