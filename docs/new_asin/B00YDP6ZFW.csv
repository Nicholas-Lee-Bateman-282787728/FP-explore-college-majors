8718199,5,B00YDP6ZFW,"I first saw ""Seven Nights in Japan"" in Bangkok, Thailand with my then boyfriend now husband in the late 1970's.  Michael York was a very popular foreign film star in Thailand at the time.  This became ""our movie"" in the sense couples have ""our song"" and such.  We loved the story and cried at the end and we related fully to the dilemma of the couple in love and the obstacle of different cultures and languages as I am Thai and my husband is American and we were trying to obtain my father's permission to marry at the time (we've been married 32 years now). The theme song is extremely beautiful and haunting, an old Japanese song updated for the movie, still popular in Thailand but virtually unknown in the USA, it's on YouTube, you will love it.  Whenever this film becomes available in an NTSC format whether on DVD or tape we'll buy it and cherish it for the romance and memories.",1326240000,7,887,4.423312883435583
