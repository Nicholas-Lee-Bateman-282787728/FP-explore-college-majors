3841397,4,B0021R4IJ4,This a must have for nana fans!  I have read all of the manga....I so wish it could have gone on longer.  Smiles. So then I picked up the anime.  It follows the books very closely.  Plus I love the music!,1355270400,,204,3.902439024390244
3841398,5,B0021R4IJ4,"I watched the entire NANA collection on Netflix at least five times before they removed it from their offerings. There it was in Japanese with English subtitles, which was fine by me! I loved the story line, the music, and the comical expressions of the characters when appropriate. I really wanted to purchase the series, but the price was just too much for me to handle. Finally, I came to realize that it would be better to get the dubbed version digitally downloaded via Amazon Instant Video than not have one at all. Since my purchase, I've watched it twice. Some of the voice inflictions are different, but that's due to the language change I'm sure. It's still my favorite!",1347235200,7,680,4.675
3841399,5,B0021R4IJ4,"The anime series Nana is a romantic/drama/comedy and is 47 episodes long. The story follows two 20-year old young women, both named Nana who meet coincidentally twice, and become room mates and then best friends. Nana Osaki is a punk singer who wants to debut with her band as soon as possible to emotionally get over her ex-boyfriend, Ren Honjo. She was the lead vocalist in her band, Black Stones with Ren, and they lived together as lovers.
Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of the popular band Trapnest. Nana chooses to stick with their old band, choosing her pride over her love for Ren.
Nana Komatsu, the other Nana, is nicknamed Hachi as she is a bit of a push-over, and is like a puppy. When her friends and boyfriend leave for Tokyo, she decides to join them a year later after having saved enough money to support herself.

As Nana O. persues her dream, and Nana K. tries to figure out her own life goals, things get increasingly complicated and dramatic. The drama includes love affairs, reunions and success. It gets very intense at times. Friendships are tested and life and love are the key.

The animation style is identical to the manga it is based on and is very good for a 47 episode series.

With the story revolving around music, there are two real-life musicians that write and sing the songs for the two bands in the series. Anna Tsuchiya writes songs for/inspired by Nana and the Black Stones. Olivia Lufkin (half japanese) writes songs for/inspired by Reira and Trapnest.
These songs are used as opening and closing songs to the anime, as well as played on the episodes.
Anna/Nana's songs are more punk/rock. I think they suit the character perfectly, and are very catchy. Olivia/Reira's songs are more epic, melodically beautiful and sound kind of like Evanesence. All the music in this series is awesome.

I would also like to add that this series is rated MA. There are scenes of sexual situations, but nothing graphic. It's definitely more adult than other shjo out there I've seen.

Nana is licensed in the states by VIZ and is available in four nicely packaged volumes. A complete series collection has not been released. It can be abit expense to get all four at once, near $200, but I found it to be worth it. As of this review date, TRSI is having a sale on all their VIZ products.

Nana was streaming on VIZ in english sub only for a time, I'm not sure if it's still streaming. The DVD volumes offer an english dubbing.

Check out Nana, it's a great story and I think you'll love the characters.",1337385600,2,2561,4.5664488017429194
3841400,5,B0021R4IJ4,"This is anime is one of the best anime i have seen so far, i started watching the show on funimation on demand! and i got addicted to it, so i end up buying the dvd box set!!!! i still need a catch up on buying the rest of the box set's and watch nana over and over again !!!",1311120000,,275,3.6
3841401,5,B0021R4IJ4,"I have been an anime fan for years, but I have to say with some regret that recent series that have been domesticated have been lacking adult/slice of life issues. I wasn't too sure about this title at first being that I had read the Paradise Kiss series that is done by the same creator as Nana and wasn't too thrilled with the series. For Nana, though, my experience has been much better. The synopsis of this series is nicely summed up in Amazon's summary, but of course doesn't really bring to focus what is so great about this story.

Often, in life, we question the what ifs. This series primarily focuses on the what ifs in life, especially in the case of the two Nana's. The secondary characters are often involved with this story which gives a nice fuller picture from everyone's perspective; but of course, the main story is revolved around the two Nana's, the friendship they create, the bond that buids into something that would be considered an obessesion, and the heartache that comes with misunderstandings, jealousy and mistakes that could've been mended easily if each Nana hadn't been so self involved with their own lives.

Each episode is played out almost as a ""flashback"" at the misjudgements that were made and where the wrong turns started in the two Nana's friendship. While the first batch of episodes on this set are at a slow pace, it starts the series with the character's backstory, how they meet and of course how they started on their paths to the mistakes that they eventually lead to later in the series. While the manga series is still ongoing, I do believe that it is coming to its end, and if it is going the way it is, it seems to end in some form of tradegy. Compared to its manga counterpart; the anime is quite accurate to the original storyline, and although I know what happens next in the series being that I have read all the released manga--I could definately say that I am still very much entertained with the anime version. It gives the story more visual elements of course and the music is just great!

Overall, this is a great series that will have you questioning your own regrets and has a bittersweetness that will tug at your heart everytime you think of the two Nana's that were destined to meet and change each other's lives!",1270944000,13,2281,4.572127139364303
3841402,5,B0021R4IJ4,"I started watching Nana in Japanese with english subtitles online, and i liked it enough to buy it from stores so i can watch it in english.  This show is Funny at times and sad at times. Some parts i cried, others i laughed until it hurt. What i find with Romantic Animes, is they tend to focus on highschool love triangles, or they tend to move slow.  This show moves at a very good pace.  It deals with Adult life, and Adult mistakes.",1269907200,4,437,4.178571428571429
3841403,4,B0021R4IJ4,"I totally agree with the reviewer ""Kayuga;"" Peach Girl was horrific, but tolerable.  Nana is much better, but I wish more music scenes were incorporated into this series.  I mean, it's great for reminiscing, but Nana is a great rock star (which we don't see much of today in the music scene!) and I want to really hear her sing more songs!  Volume 3 comes out February 2nd, so maybe I'll get my wish!

This anime series DVD set is great for those who are 20-something, or girlfriends who want to get together and reminiscence about their college days gone by...",1263772800,3,561,4.524752475247524
3841404,5,B0021R4IJ4,This is a very awesome series!!! I just love it!!! If I could choose which Nana I would be... it has to be the one who's the rock star! I can't wait until the next boxset comes out!!!!,1257638400,2,184,3.8684210526315788
3841405,4,B0021R4IJ4,"For any of you who may have suffered through the ridiculous train wreck that was the Peach Girl anime, Nana is a fresh breath of air. Yes there's pretty clueless girls, and plenty of hot guys, and yes there's lots of drama. but it's all done better. The animation is better. The voice acting is better, the characters are more developed and real. It is kind of paced slow, it starts at the present time and then spends 6 episodes giving u their back story of the year before they all moved to Tokyo. The only bad episode is where u see basically the entire first episode all over again, but with smaller new parts added. that was kind of cheap, but its off to a great start. It follows the manga pretty faithfully, and so everything is gone into detail..maybe a little bit too much. and sadly at episode 11 things are really starting to take off, but that's where this dvd collection cuts off. My ouran host club collections have at least 13 episodes and i think they could have at least given us two more episodes for the price they are asking. Nana is a great story, and it is a rollercoaster, things don't always work out they way u think they will. If u like, drama, love, sex and lots of rock'n roll then Nana is for u!
also, i got a sweet guitar pick with Nana O.'s tattoo on it. very cool. check this one out ladies!!",1252972800,21,1324,4.257936507936508

3841419,5,B0021R4IJ4,I was looking for something to watch and came across this series. It starts off cutesy and entertaining. By the second or third episode you're hooked! Do yourself a favor and give it a shot. It's definitely a girls flick. Worth buying and re-watching.,1417824000,4,251,4.7272727272727275

3841423,5,B0021R4IJ4,"It's a terrific story about 2 young ladies both named ""Nana"", which also means ""seven"" in Japanese. It's a slice of life drama with some light hearted moments, and growing pains, and some awesome music (even if you can't understand the lyrics)! There are also some great friendships. While it has 51 episodes altogether, it definitely held my interest. It's sort of like getting hooked on a soap opera, but much better! There are some unexpected twists and turns, and, having watched the series with subtitles, it's cool to have it with English dubs now, too.
If you're going to buy this set, buy them all. It's worth it!!",1403740800,,622,4.715596330275229
3841424,5,B0021R4IJ4,I've read the manga and this anime is just like it. Amazing. :) would definitely buy more of the seasons!!!,1395273600,,107,4.4
3841425,5,B0021R4IJ4,NANA is just awesome!!!!! I even got my friend hooked and she doesn't even watch anime. I you haven't watched it go ahead and give it a try. I will disclaim that you have to get past the first six episodes because the get repetitive. But once you do you will be hooked.,1393977600,,269,4.09433962264151
3841436,5,B0021R4IJ4,"This anime right here is beautiful. The characters and well written and incredibly well animated. The story it's self is fantastic. The opening and ending theme songs are incredible,beautiful and catchy. The score of the show is fantastic. Honestly you need to see NANA it is fantastic beginning to end!",1389571200,,303,5.08

3841439,5,B0021R4IJ4,"Favorite anime, came in new packaging and has had no problems with playing. Highly recommended for any NANA fans. also came quite fast!",1381190400,2,135,4.913043478260869
3841440,5,B0021R4IJ4,Is a great gal pal series for anyone who likes adult drama. Although you find yourself wondering why Hachi is such an idiot at times lol. The price dropped to about half so I bought it. I have been following the box sets for months and they always were around $30 to $50 then al the sudden the box sets dropped down to $24.99. I jumped on that opportunity. I still have part 2 to buy then I have them all LoL.,1373328000,,409,4.0
3841441,3,B0021R4IJ4,"I bought and watched Nana Uncut box set 1, Nana Uncut box set 2, Nana Uncut box set 3, and Nana Uncut box set 4. I do not think that I would watch it again. I may be wrong, but I don't believe so. If you are truly friends, I don't believe that one would continually miss seeing old friends for a yearly reunion. It seemed like Nana the singer dropped her old friends.",1369612800,,367,3.972972972972973
3841442,5,B0021R4IJ4,"I'd say this Anime is for women 18+.  Its a very coming of age/learning to be an adult story + romance + great music.  I picked up this anime because I'd recently watched Mongolian Chop Squad (Beck), which is very much a boy's coming of age in a slice of life anime, and this anime was listed in some recommendations for people that liked that anime.  So If you like this one, you might check out that one!",1368921600,,406,4.17948717948718
3841443,4,B0021R4IJ4,"It didn't come across to me as good as everyone brags it to be, however it is a very well put together series. If you really love ""a piece of life"" animes, this one is for you.

I did enjoy the anime, the music, and the drama. It's worth watching at least once. As far as wow factors, the only one that wowed me was on the very last episode of box set 4. It was so piece of life, that it hurt yet you still liked the ending.",1365292800,,424,3.764044943820225

3841445,4,B0021R4IJ4,"Loves this series but be warned, it ends without much of a resolution or conclusion. This is to be expected since the anime was created before the manga was finished (it is still ongoing I believe). However, the show is great right up until the end so I still give it four stars and it is one of the few series I've watched more than once.",1357948800,2,339,4.151515151515151
8349445,5,B0021R4IJ4,The ending kind of leaves you on a bad note/cliff hanger but the entire show is just hilarious. Its very realistic in that life doesnt always go the way you want to and people make mistakes. But it is also very funny and lighthearted which helps you get through and cope with all the emotions you experience with the main character. Not for kids but definitely a must watch.,1502496000,,374,4.434782608695652
8349446,5,B0021R4IJ4,"I think all girls should want this series at least once. Lots of real life problems and characters you can relate to, the music is AMAZING, and i found myself crying at certain moments.
The beginning of the series is my favorite and i will watch this box set over and over.",1497830400,,273,4.269230769230769

8349450,2,B0021R4IJ4,"I thought I might like this because I liked Rumbling Hearts (similar only in so much as they are both dramas).  While Nana had a few laughs and I can see it's appeal for others who may appreciate the girl drama thing, I just did not care for it.  I bought it and was willing to soldier on through it, until I found a few episodes where they repeat scenes from previous episodes almost verbatim and these repeats take up almost the entire episodes.  I can say this is worth it if you really REALLY like girl drama anime.  If you aren't a fan I would avoid it.  Oh and I have no idea why this has so many explicit content warnings on it.  As far as I watched (mid way through disc 3) it was one of the most tame animes I have ever seen.",1452988800,,734,3.993150684931507
