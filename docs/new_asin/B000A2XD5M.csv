8073390,4,B000A2XD5M,"""Vicious Vixes: 3 Classic Movies"" actually only features two classic low-budget European movies from 1971. The third film is the oddity, an even lower-budgeted American film from 1995 and far from classic.

=========================

THE VAMPIRE HAPPENING

This is a West German horror/comedy from 1971 (the German title can roughly be translated as ""You Only Get Bitten at Night""). The beautiful Pia Degermark plays a double role as an American actress who inherits a castle in Transylvania and discovers that her grandmother is a vampire who looks just like her, albeit raven-haired, also played by Pia. Some of the inhabitants of a nearby monastery and girl's school join the ranks of the undead and the vampires throw a helluva costume party where Dracula shows up.

The movie combines elements of ""Kiss of the Vampire"" (1963) and ""The Devil's Nightmare"" (1971) with the zaniness of ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" (1967). It's a fun romp and not supposed to be taken seriously; anyone offended by its irreverence needs to visit the psyche ward.

Ms. Degermark's amazing beauty is a key highlight. Pia was married to the producer at the time and was a promising starlet; she previously won awards at Cannes (Best Actress) and the Golden Globes (Most Promising Female Newcomer). Not that I care about such awards; I just want to establish Pia's blossoming career at the time. Unfortunately, this was her final film -- of only four -- and she divorced the producer a couple years later, falling into anorexia, poverty, fraud and prison in the later 70s. How the mighty have fallen! But, thankfully, I heard she later got her life back on track. In any event, she was in her prime in this movie and does an impressive job in the dual role; in fact, she easily carries the film.

Actually, there are quite a few good-lookin' women on display here, but their portrayal is too one-dimensional. If you're a breast man, though, you'll be ecstatic.

The film was directed by Freddie Francis, an Oscar-winning cinematographer, known for such quality films as ""Glory,"" ""Cape Fear"" (1991), ""The Elephant Man,"" ""The Creeping Flesh"" and ""Dracula has Risen from the Grave,"" but also lesser films (to be nice) like the infamous ""Trog."" I point this out to stress that this is not some amateur production, although you might think it is since it's such an obscure public domain film, featured on numerous cheap DVDs.

""The Vampire Happening"" plays out like a satire of Hammer's vampire flicks. As such, there's quite a bit to appreciate here if you're in the mood for a horror sex comedy. The problem is that the story tends to meander.

I found the depiction of the Roman monastery and monks to be interesting. Is this what people think Christianity really is? Dull, sterile men wearing drab robes swearing off sex and marriage, utterly appalled by any depiction of nudity, sex or sexuality? I guess they never seriously examined the Song of Songs in their studies (or much of the rest of the Bible, for that matter). What an absurd and erroneous depiction of Christianity, and I'm not blaming the filmmakers, but rather the idiotic religious spirit and sterile organizations that foster such a depiction.

The film runs 102 minutes and was shot at Castle Kreuzenstein, Austria.

FINAL WORD: Although ""The Vampire Happening"" is a Euro-trash horror sex comedy, it's a fun film if you're in the right mode. It amusingly spoofs vampire flicks and features a strong protagonist/antagonist performance by Pia Degermark. On the downside, it's a little overlong and the story isn't fully engaging, not to mention they drop the ball with the women by being ridiculously one-dimensional. Nevertheless, it's way more entertaining than Polanski's overrated ""The Fearless Vampire Killers.""

GRADE: C+/B- (5.5/10)

LADY FRANKENSTEIN

***This review contains plot SPOILERS***

I admit that I'm not a big fan of Frankenstein. The idea of a mad scientist creating a living human creature from spare body parts of corpses never fascinated me. Over the years I've seen various Frankenstein films or, at least, clips and the story just never did anything for me. That is, until I recently saw the 1971 Italian film ""Lady Frankenstein"" starring Rosalba Neri (AKA Sara Bey) in the title role of Tania Frankenstein, the beautiful daughter of Baron Frankenstein.

So what sets ""Lady Frankenstein"" apart from all the other Frankenstein incarnations? Well, the film starts out as a standard Frankenstein flick with Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Charles Marshall trying to create life from the body parts of recently dead corpses. A new element is introduced in this story and that, as expected, is Frankenstein's daughter Tania. Tania has just graduated medical school as a surgeon and reveals to her father and Charles that she knows what they're trying to achieve and wants to assist them in their gruesome work. Before they agree to her partnership they successfully give life to a hideous monster. The monster kills Dr. Frankenstein and proceeds to go on a killing spree in the country-side.

Meanwhile Tania and Charles come up with a mad scheme to create another ""monster"" that will have the same super stength necessary to slay the original creature that murdered Tania's father. Ultimately it is revealed that Charles profoundly loves Tania, even though he's much older than her. Tania admits that she loves Charles' mind but he's physically too old and feeble to stir her carnal passions. Their insane answer to this predicament is to murder the local retarded hunk and replace his brain with Charles'!! Only then will Tania have her cake and eat it too -- the perfect brain with the perfect body!

As you can see, ""Lady Frankenstein"" takes the done-to-death Frankenstein story and gives it a much-needed new twist, a highly intriguing twist, I might add. Even though this is so, the film would have failed if it didn't have the right person in the titular role. All I can say is Rosalba Neri (credited as Sara Bey) is magnificent as Tania Frankenstein. It's more than just her obvious physical beauty, highlighted by those big cat-like eyes, it's the utter passion and seriousness she puts into the role. Tania fully realizes the womanly power she holds and expertly utilizes it to easily put Charles into a love-trance so profound that he's actually willing to have his brain transplanted for her. I would have done the same thing. What red-blooded man could possibly resist her charms?

The American version is only 85 minutes, cut down from the original 96 minutes. I'm gonna be on the look out for the longer version, but the 85 minute version is fine as is. Trust me, Rosalba is fully shown in all her glory in this short version. Interestingly, even though this is so, the film powerfully illustrates that sexuality and beauty are far more than a matter of simply showing skin as Rosalba expertly oozes beauty and sensuality in every blink, eye movement, word and motion!

In addition, you get everything else you'd ever want in a Frankenstein picture -- sincere but sincerely mad ""scientists,"" dungeons, monsters on the rampage, beautiful damsels, horse-drawn carriages and torch-carrying village mobs out for blood.

Make no mistake, despite the limitations of being a Grade-B Italian flick from 1971 this is a powerful horror film about the insanity of obsession (for achievement, honor, love, loyalty, lust, money and revenge) and its consequences. It's as good or better than just about any Hammer film. I should add that ""Lady Frankenstein"" is not goofy, campy or comedic as the cover art of some of the DVDs would suggest; this is a serious take on the Frankenstein story, just keep in mind its origins.

GRADE: A-

=========================

VICIOUS KISS

A woman traumatized by her husbands adulterous actions becomes fixated on a man who looks like her husband and it's a fatal attraction.

Like I said above, this 1995 film isn't a good match for the other two being that it came out 25 years later and is a much lesser production, not that the other two were Grade-A productions. The film features the lead actress nude in a tasteful way and has a couple softcore sex scenes. Other than that it's a veritable TV soap opera shot in the Atlanta area and runs 90 minutes.

I'm not going to grade it because I fast-forwarded through most of it, but I might watch it fully some day. Like I said, it plays like a TV soap opera -- yes, that low-level of filmmaking -- with a few sex scenes and a little violence.

=========================

FINAL WORD: Another reviewer gave this compilation a 1-Star rating. Don't believe it. The first two films are worth the purchase price, even though they're not the best quality. Their picture quality is similar to a decent VHS,  which is par for the course for such old, obscure Grade B films, meaning they're definitely watchable. The third film looks quite good actually.",1396224000,,8929,4.952508361204013
