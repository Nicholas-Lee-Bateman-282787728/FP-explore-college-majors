1394038,5,B000055WGM,"This child once was lost and now is found by her loving Native American family.  I loved this movie, it shows how the Native people live by their traditions, and their deep love of family.  The acting was very good, and the story seemed very real.  It is a movie to be watched again, and again.
Like most Hallmark Hall of Fame movies it is one that should be enjoyed by the whole family.",1206403200,,387,4.202702702702703
1394039,3,B000055WGM,"Such conflict within my soul! Oh the torment! On one hand, the acting in this TV movie is just excellent. Mercedes Ruehl, the lead, is wonderful as Rebecca, as is her husband (Jamey Sheridan), the ever good-lookin Ned Romero as her dad, and Julia McIlvaine as her eldest daughter. So that makes it hard for me to say that the casting ruined the movie.

I simply could *not* get past the fact that Ruehl is supposed to be a full-blood Dine. I was so confused when I found out that neither her mom nor dad was white--I assumed the character was half-white. Maybe possibly  sorta kinda (given the unpredictability of genetics) Ruehl could pass as half-Dine', but even that's pushing it. She isn't Native at all, although she could certainly `pass' as a quarter. But not Navajo! (For that matter, a bunch of the Indian actors don't look Navajo at all, but I can get past that because it's so normal (Irene Bedard has played a Navajo role a zillion times, but even she and the other sisters, including the awesome Tamara Podemski, look nothing alike). Even worse, the girl who plays the young Rebecca looks so white that it's jarring to see her in a shot with her birth mother, all while knowing that her dad is supposed to be Ned Romero (who does look Navajo in his old age). I would also complain about casting Julia McIlvaine as her elder daughter, who clearly isn't half Dine' but rather could've stepped right off the Nina, the Pinta, or the Santa Maria (the younger daughter could presumably have just gotten 80% recessive genes, but she wasn't very convincing either). But this is based on a true story, and indeed, I do know mixed-race families where someone impossibly comes out with blondish hair (like my cousin)...and then there are all those 1/128 blonde Cherokees, of course.  But STILL! So hard to get past. And, as great as Mercedes Ruehl was, there are plenty of excellent Native actresses her age who could've been casted instead. Why not Sheila Tousey? She could have totally pulled off this character (and is light-skinned enough to be convincingly racially ambiguous in her prior life). Enough complaining, but I hate that I can't put this on my Good Indian Movies list (see my Listmania) because of this glaring problem. Tragic! Indeed!

On the other hand, because this is based on a true story, there's a great deal of non-Hollywood realism here that I really appreciated. Aside from the totally cheesy Hallmark soundtrack and Wise Indian Elder lines they made Tantoo Cardinal say, the relationships and family dynamics played out with such genuineness, and that's what really makes you care about the story. The cultural dissonance played out really effectively, too, and had enough tension to make you feel it and invest in the characters more. (Although--I felt that some of that dissonance was presented in too much of a one-sided way and could make white viewers see Navajo culture in a negative light.) I'm torn (oh woe!) on the last positive, too...I thought they presented a really broad sense of life on that particular rez from the average school to the community center, but there were also times when I also felt they were kinda making things seem more `exotic' than they really are. I mean, where were the schoolkids listening to rap? Where was the bingo? But as a whole, I thought the story was engaging and well told. I'd be interested in checking out the book.",1205020800,,3394,4.737732656514383
1394040,5,B000055WGM,"All of my favorite Native American actors are in this movie! I love this fairly modern Native American tradition of using Hollywood to speak their truth about who they are, where they have come from, and where they are going - to break stereotypes and honor their roots.

This movie is about a woman who is adopted by a woman who obviously desperately needed a child to love - but who may have gone to desperate lengths to get one. This movie tells the story about a rather painful American tradition of stealing Native American children - not just this one, but many, many others - in order to break the Spirit of the Native American people. Most of the other reviewers on Amazon.com seem to have missed this point, a point that is carefully and poignantly made.

In addition to taking Native American children from their tribes, cutting their hair, forbidding them to speak their native language and making their religion illegal (freedom of religion, anyone?); factoids that are NOT mentioned in this movie, who knew that children were actually stolen from Native American families (in ""modern"" times) for profit, and for no other real motive than the ongoing genocide of the Native American people?

I wasn't sure how Mercedes Ruehl would do in this role. I didn't think she was Native American herself - she's not. Turns out, she is Cuban American. But I am a fan, from The Fisher King to GIA to Indictment: The McMartin Trial (although I didn't like the movie, I DID like the character she played in it); I like Mercedes Ruehl. She carries the role with style, humility, and grace. She is a well-known actor, and this often gives a Native American story more ""box office"" cache. So be it.

This is a great movie, highly recommended. We have so much to learn, as Americans, about who we are.

1394041,4,B000055WGM,"If you enjoy a feel good movie, if you have a real interest in Native American culture, this is a movie for you to see. All the actors did a fine job. I will see this more than once.",1185235200,,182,3.6923076923076925
1394042,4,B000055WGM,"This is a good story, with much depth. About a womam who finds out where she finally belongs, and convinces her husband and children to adapt to their new found family, her Navajo family, which they do eventually,after many setbacks  and heartsearching.  Beautiful scenery, which does look like the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. Hopefully it is. I enjoyed this dvd very much. M.O.Australia.",1182211200,,391,5.190476190476191
1394043,5,B000055WGM,"This is probably the best Native American movie I have ever watched. The story is so true of the things that happen even today, to the Indians. Heart wrenching to the core, you will cry as you watch this movie again and again. I can certainly identify with ""Odette Marie"". A movie filled with love, and sorrow yet so much truth, you can't help but feel the pain and joy of these precious people. For me, this is an Academy Award Winner Movie! Thank you to the people that made it!

1394044,5,B000055WGM,"This is a very heart warming movie about coming home. It reinforces the strong family bonds even through years of separation. It explores the need to stand up against unhealthy traditions in a changing world, as well as, traditions which can help define who we are in an ever changing world.",1041638400,20,291,4.7254901960784315
1394045,3,B000055WGM,"Adopted by a middle aged Jewish couple and doted on by her mother young Rebecca Hoffman leads a conventional life. Then her mother dies and her father remarries. In his new marriage there is no room for Rebecca. She is one to be tolerated. She no longer has a home. Years later Rebecca searches for her birth parents and comes to the realization that she is not white nor Jewish. Rebecca is Navajo.
  Lost Child is a film based on the the autobiography,  Looking For Lost Bird, by Yvette Melanson. In this picture we see the life of a child stolen from her birth parents and made to assume a new identity. Her adoptive father's reluctance to have her, her feeling of isolation and her quest to find her identity is both moving and tragic as we see a young woman so far from her home.
  Mercedes Ruehl plays a sensitive and savy Rebecca who tries so hard to be accepted by her adoptive father. Her discovery of her Navajo roots gives her comfort and a sense of completion. Yet, she too and her family undergo some heartaches and challenges as she returns home. This movie shows the hope of a mother seeking a reunion of her children. We witness the reintergration of a woman back to her heritage. We also see the ugly side of cultural prejudice as her daughters attempt to fit in with their new family and culture.
  This is an enjoyable film that is a sanitized version of the book. Everyone in the picture is so good, so noble to the point of being unbelievable. Of course everything works itself out and the family lives happily ever after. If only life could be that simple. Inspite of that Lost Child is well worth your seeing as you get a glimpse into another culture.",1024531200,44,1673,4.429967426710098

1394100,4,B000055WGM,"Mercedes Ruehl was totally believable in this movie.  The first part rang with truth in that she was very happy with her adoptive parents till her mother died and her father married again.  The fact that her father would pretty much toss her out the door because his new wife didn't want to be bothered with her was, in a way, hard for me to believe because they were jewish and jews care about family.  But, then he was a man trying to keep a woman and some men will do anything in order to do that.  But, it left her totally abandoned with no family at all for years.  Made me wonder if her father would have tossed her out like that if she had been his natural born daughter??? Her finding of her birth family seemed to happen so suddenly that I hardly knew what was going on but I could understand her desire to embrace them in any way she could because of having no family for so long.  I wish she had been able to find her lost twin brother as that would have really make a wonderful story.  Her husband and two daughters have a hard time adjusting as well they might.  I can't imagine anything more shocking than moving onto an Indian reservation with all the singing and dancing, food stamps, no jobs, crummy place to live, etc. Anyway, it's a good movie.",1401667200,,1263,4.2552301255230125
1394101,5,B000055WGM,I have always caught this halfway through and finally was able to see the whole story. I like the idea that the main character was raised Jewish by was really a stolen Navaho baby. I didn't know such things happened to the tribe as well as the Apache. The warm reception of her lost family to her own family was heartwarming.,1395964800,,325,4.344262295081967
1394102,5,B000055WGM,I have this on VHS and have watched it so many times that it was time to upgrade to DVD.  I had read the wonderful book and the movie brings it to life beautifully.

1394104,5,B000055WGM,"The  story and the scenery are so beautiful,it makes you want to move and live where this was filmed. The heritage is told in such a loving,happy, honest way. When her biological father is explaining how babies were taken from their cradle boards then expresses the pain of his wife,her real Mom felt as she was crying ""Where are my babies?"" He said those words so beautifully,I thought I was involved in their lives for real.  I felt like I was related to all  of the characters in the movie. The husband and wife were paired perfectly,as were the 2 girls as the daughters..This is a great family film,that you will want to watch over and over. I know.

I believe the foundation for this story occurred more than a few times, unfortunately.  Marvelous story of a woman trying to find her place and finding her roots which just as easily could have been Native American, German, French, etc.  Would recommend again and again, and also recommend that we dig deeper to find who we are.",1353715200,,431,4.657894736842105

The acting, even by the children, is fantastic. Based on facts that really did happen to American Indian children in the 60's, (and other years) it will tug at your heart. I know it did mine.....

The acting is top-notch all around, including several well-known Indian actors like Tantoo Cardinal, Ned Romero, the lovely Irene Bedard, and Michael Greyeyes, who went on to star in the PBS adaptation of Tony Hillard's ""Skinwalkers.""

7931138,5,B000055WGM,"This is another great movie from Hallmark. I came across this movie by chance on cable, but it had already started. So I wrote down the name of the movie and found it on here and bought it. It is based on a true story about a Lost Bird finding their way back home. The main character in this movie is a lost bird, a child that was stolen from her Native parents and sold on the black market. She was separated from her Twin. This does have some clash of cultures as she was raised with a non-native family and now has to learn about her people and their ways, her husband and their two children, included. I hope someday that her twin finds his way back home too and that Hallmark makes another movie about it. One thing I did not like however, was how her birth father spoke English instead of Din (Navajo). In real life, her father didn't speak English, only Din and she had to have someone who spoke both English and Din, to be able to speak to her birth father. Overall, a great movie with a great native and non-native cast like Irene Berdard, Tantoo Cardinal and Mercedes Ruehl to name a few.",1440460800,,1098,4.233333333333333
