8432120,3,6303510426,"I have to preface this by saying, I bought this new in shrink wrap for  $1.07 at the local video store.  So I really liked the price.  Actually, I  said, ""cool"", when I saw the video sitting there.  I've always  liked the story lines in both movies.  Sure this is really low-budget  stuff.  You can't expect much.  But, the story concepts are intriguing.  Phantom Planet has little people, living on little worlds in the asteroid  belt.  These little worlds have little wars.  The good guys are saved by  one of us normal people, who breathes their air, shrinks and falls in love  with one of the tiny citizens. Whats hard to believe about that? Huh? : )  The battle scenes are pretty good, the bad guys fly flaming  meteorites.
Phantom from Space offers an invisible alien who, for some  unknown reason, murders two guys.  He is then tracked down by the police,  scientists and the most fearsome members of the FCC. FCC?  Yep, with there  egg-beater antennas riding on top of there cars that track this poor alien  down.  The alien then dies from lack of methane (should have found a  burping cow).
Where else could you see such things.
Despite what the  experts say, these films are fun.  At late on a Saturday night, when you're  almost sober, these are good watching.
If you find it for $1.00, buy it  (sorry Amazon.com, you're to expensive).
Oh yea, one last thing, don't  watch this on a big screen TV, the picture quality is really bad.  Dig that  old 12inch B&W out from the back of the closet, you'll be much happier  with what you see.",968198400,,1545,4.498181818181818
