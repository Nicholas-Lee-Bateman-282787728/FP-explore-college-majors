7931060,5,B000054OW6,The case was definitely used but the DVD was in great condition. The insert was also missing in this DVD which I was dissapointed about but the DVD itself is awesome. This is something every Offspring fan should have. It's not very long at all but it portrays their lifestyle's and I love that.,1266969600,,294,4.462962962962963
7931061,5,B000054OW6,"The contents of this video are extreme sports, a 'cultural' time with Noodles, the band's lead guitarist, some time with the band's crew and 5 live performances of The Kids Aren't Alright, All I Want, Gone Away, L.A.P.D. and Staring At The Sun.
This time, with some music from the CO1 album as the background.",1041120000,9,309,4.636363636363637
7931062,2,B000054OW6,"This is not a dvd you can watch over. The first 5 minutes is a replyay of a guy jumping off a pole and it goes over and over. Some of the skateboarding is cool but nothing great. The only cool things are the 2 live tracks from the rain festival which are awsome and the bonus live preformance of kids arnt alright. Staring at the sun live and lapd live are annoying, tiny club venue which is neat but there is heaps of stupid video effects going on distorting nearly all the picture. The dvd is onyl about 30 minutes long not including the cridits. And you get very sick of it quickly.
The only funny thing is in meet the crew bonus feature when daneil johns from silverchair makes out with one of the offsprings roadie guys.
Anyway don't buy this dvd, it sucks ass apart from about 6 minutes of decent live footlage.",1031529600,7,817,4.243589743589744
7931063,5,B000054OW6,"For me, ""The Offspring"" is defenitely the best band ever... and i know a lot of people who thinks the same. For us, the best video on earth is definitely this one. Concerts, making of, extreme sports, and offspring fun... Offspring Fans, hurry hup and buy this DVD!",999648000,2,265,4.541666666666667
7931064,2,B000054OW6,This is dumb. Everything on this CD is on the Conspircy of One CD. And look at the price. Thats how much the CD costs. So if you have a computer with quality graphics then just buy consircy of one and get all this stuff plus a good album.,991872000,4,238,3.877551020408163
7931065,2,B000054OW6,just star for the great quality and star for the new stuf americana very bad quality.. but much better than huck it..,983491200,,117,4.363636363636363
