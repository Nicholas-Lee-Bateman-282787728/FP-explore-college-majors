1365043,1,B00004WI55,"I can't remotely understand why Mr. Allen decided to participate in this awful movie. ""Picking Up the Pieces"" is everything except funny. I can't understand what attracted such talented people to a project like this one. The movie has no direction and it seems it's wandering aimlessly.

1365044,2,B00004WI55,"This movie starts with a man (Woody Allen) trying to dispose of the remains of his wife (Sharon Stone) in a small town in New Mexico. He cut her into seven pieces when raged by her continuous cheating. Everything would have gone well, if he didn't lose his wife's hand on the way. The people from the village found this hand and it started to perform miracles for anyone who asked...
I was much disappointed by this movie. The cover makes one expect a light comedy. It was not so, Picking Up the Pieces was at times very slow and overall not really funny. There was too much packed all at once but, in my opinion, the biggest fault of the movie was the sound effects: the dialogues and monologues were quiet and unclear. So were the relationship and morals of people.
I liked the character portrayed by Maria Gracia Cucinotta. Nevertheless, despite the fact that she was good for it, it should have been developed more in the movie. She is a prostitute who decides to change her profession and that decision is a bigger miracle than any performed by the hand at the same time to people surrounding her. This miracle came from within and the things done by the hand were all physical. The idea of this movie had a lot of possibilities that were wasted.  I would not recommend paying money for watching this movie.",996019200,3,1312,4.489539748953975
1365045,5,B00004WI55,UNBELIEVABLY FUNNY this dark comedy requires more than one viewing. It really catches you off guard the first time through. It's not for everyone but the savvy viewer will surely adore this film. An understanding of the Catholic Church will be helpful in fully appreciating it. This cast of stars does a superb job with the exception of Fran Drescher. It's a real shame that this film was acquired by Cinamax and missed being shown in theaters throughout the world. Buy the DVD and it will surely be a favorite in your collection.,978739200,3,530,4.709677419354839
1365046,2,B00004WI55,"Before I watched this movie, I read very negative critics about it, but I decided to check it anyway,mainly because of Woody Allen.
This movie was not made to be taken serious. It's a crazy comedy, with lots of surreal elements and an absurd plot. It's a story about a butcher who kills his wife, picking her to pieces. Accidentaly, he looses her hand, which is later found by a mexican bind woman, who believes she's cured by a miracle. Then, the news are spread, and the whole city of El Nino believes in the power of this hand.
It may seem stupid, but it is actually a critic to fanatic people, who start believing in everything they see. The cast was well chosen. David Schwimmer plays a priest who is in love with a whore (shocking, isn't it?), proving that he can do more than Ross (Friends). Woody is funny and neurotic as always,and it makes the movie worth your money.
Of course, this is not the best film you'll ever see, but it is funny in a certain way.",973900800,6,965,4.337016574585635
1365047,1,B00004WI55,"I couldn't agree more with the underage reviewer. I thought that this was a ""can't miss"" cast, but there you go. Get a bunch of great comedy actors, give them a shallow, stupid screenplay and get a director like Arau, who seems to be more worried about the colors than about the action, and this is what you get. The movie is full of all the misconceptions that people have about Mexico north of the Rio Grande: the religion, the magic, the holy prostitute. It's like those cheesy postcards that you get at tourist traps. But at the same it's pretentious and thus, harmful. Some peolpe may even think that after seeing this movie they may have learned something about Mexico or Latin America but it's quite the opposite. Of course we could forgive this if jokes at least made us smile, which doesn't ever happen. Don't waste a single penny on this movie, don't even rent it. Another lousy movie from a lousy director like Alfonso Arau.",973728000,4,935,4.571428571428571
1365048,5,B00004WI55,"Mexican Director Alfonso Arau provides an exquisite movie. We could say it's a ""mystical comedy"", that mixes magical reality with  fearless satire.  An ironic piece, mainly about religion in a small town in  New Mexico.
With an extraordinary cast that includes David Schwimmer  (""Friends""), Mara Grazia Cucinotta, Cheech Marin, Kiefer  Sutherland, Anglica Aragn, Alfonso Arau, Sharon Stone and Woody Allen,  ""Picking Up the Pieces"" provides really cutting edge humor, not  for everybody's taste.
Due to distribution problems, the movie was not  released in theaters.  It was shown on Cinemax for a few months, but it was  originally intended for the big screen.  Therefore, this DVD version is  actually the closest chance for the public to enjoy it as it was  conceived.
This independent film was produced by the Kushner-Locke  Company, and it's about a kosher butcher (Woody Allen playing as Woody  Allen) sick and tired of his  unfaithful wife (Stone), up to the point  where he kills her and cuts her into pieces.  On his way to bury her  remains he loses a hand, that is found by a blind woman that recovers  sight. From then on the hand performs all kind of miracles among the  unhabitants of ""El Nio"".

Woody Allen is only an actor in this movie, and lends his usual persona to it, but I don't know how much input he had. I can't find any credits for him as writer in the synopsis and he didn't direct it.
The best that could be said for him in his defense is that it wasn't his idea.
I guess this is some auteur's distorted idea of a ""madcap macabre"" comedy, but it doesn't work.

1365097,5,B00004WI55,"This has just got to be one of the funniest dark comedies ever made!  Alternately satirical and sweet, hilarious, and insightful.  Almost no institution is safe from the satire- but religion, moral hypocrisy & good old human greed are the primary targets, artfully intertwined into a very clever and entertaining story line.

It is also one of the few movies featuring Woody Allen that he didn't write & direct.  But the cast (as well as the plot) has as much variety as a typical Allen flik-- David Schwimmer, Sharon Stone, Kiefer Southerland, Cheech Marin, Andy Dick, Fran Drescher, and the gorgeous Maria Grazia Cucinotta, to name a few.

In reading the negative reviews for this flik, it would seem that thinly-disguised (or even overt) ""moral indignation"" over the subject matter is the main reason for their discontent.  Hmm.  Methinks they doth protest a bit too much?  Can't help but wonder how many of these folks would have the same viewpoint about ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", ""Eating Raoul"", ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", or any of the myriad of other dark comedies about murder and its aftermath.

Oh, but right-- THOSE flix don't make fun of religion... and its mindless, mercenary followers.  Hits a few sore spots, does it?

Of course, one would have to excuse anyone who's had a family member or friend that was killed, for finding the movie distasteful... but then, ANY flick about murder would be out of bounds for them, light comedy or otherwise.  Everyone else needs to revisit the definition of ""dark comedy"", before bitching and whining so much.  This film is really, really funny!

Oh, and for the guy who said ""stupidity is not funny"". . . Gee, I wonder what Laurel & Hardy, the Stooges, or the Marx Brothers would say about that, considering they made an entire career out of lampooning the basic stupidity of all people?  In fact, I'd say that a good 75% of humor involves laughing at the stupidity and misfortune of ""others"" (and therefore ourselves)-- and that's a very conservative estimate.

Listen-- if you're not squeamish about religious satire, and you don't mind comedy regarding body parts, sex, and mindless greed, you'll laugh your butt off.  Otherwise, stick to Bambi, or a sappy John Wayne movie, or The Ten Commandments, or whatever else floats your boat.",1308182400,10,2316,4.897435897435898
1365098,4,B00004WI55,"Only A Genious could make such a creative and funny movie as this.

1365128,3,B00004WI55,"In ""Picking Up the Pieces"" Woody Allen plays a kosher butcher named Tex Cowley, complete with the cowboy boots and Stetson, who chops up his philandering wife Candy (Sharon Stone) into seven pieces.  He buries the pieces across the border from Texas in New Mexico, but loses Candy's hand.  A blind woman stumbles across the hand, which is still giving the finger (apparently a last act of defiance as Candy was butchered), and is cured.  The next thing we know the hand is being venerated in the church of a small town for its ability to work miracles, much to the dismay of the local priest, Father Leo (David Schwimmer), and the delight of Mayor Machado (Cheech Marin) and the locals.  After all, not only are their prayers answered but the town ends up being overrun by tourists willing to pay for anything having to do with the hand.

Now, you look at that plot summary and the stellar cast that shows up for this one and you would think ""Picking Up the Pieces"" is a Woody Allen movie, but it is actually written by Bill Wilson and directed by Alfonso Arau.  It is the first screenplay for the writer but the director did ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and ""A Walk in the Clouds,"" which would certainly explain why the cast showed up for this one.  That is because the script does not know what to do with this rather interesting premise.  There are some funny moments, but ultimately ""Picking Up the Pieces"" makes you appreciate the coherence and passion of Kevin Smith's ""Dogma.""

I want to think that this film is a satire, but I am not sure exactly what the target is supposed to be here.  I do not think it is the Catholic Church, even though the Vatican dispatches Elliott Gould, Fran Drescher and Andy Dick to authenticate ""the hand of the Virgin.""  I thought maybe it was a scathing look the notion of faith, but that seemed off point since the hand is indeed miraculous even though if from the nature of the miracles it seems clear the hand belongs to an American.  Then I mulled over notions of justice given that counterbalancing the miracles of the hand is the quest of Bobo (Keiffer Sutherland), a Texas lawman and one of Candy's many lovers who wants to bring her husband to justice.  But that did not work out to a tenable position either.

Then at the end in Woody Allen's final voice over, the morale (or punch line) to the film is revealed.  That was almost enough for me to drop this 2000 comedy's rating one more star and you understand why this film went direct to video in the United States (but was actually released in Spain, presumably because of Arau, and in France, obviously because of Allen's name in the cast).  But the premise is too good even if the execution is that bad.  Still, even though there was a commentary track in which the director probably explains what he was thinking, I decided to skip it because once Arau explained in the featurette on the DVD that being the key to being politically incorrect was to be subversive, it became clear there really was no real point to what was going on, just the aforementioned punch line.

Allen's nebbish actually gets to be less of a nebbish than we are accustomed to and there are some nice moments when he is up against Sutherland's hardnosed cop.  However the focal character in the film is Schwimmer's priest, who is, ironically enough, the one character who is outside of what is going on with the hand and its miracles.  I thought that the fact he was more interested in Desi (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), a local prostitute, than he was in his church was a key to understanding the film, but that turned out not to be the case either in this farcical fantasy.  Eddie Griffin as Sediento (""Always thirsty"" apparently), the town drunk, is the biggest scene stealer as the miracles and tourists get his character to speak up as the conscience for the town, but he turns out to be a dead end.  Arau tells us this is a black romantic comedy with a touch of farce done in a magical realistic manner as an example of political incorrectness.  I am not prepared to argue against that interpretation fo the text, but knowing that is what is going on does not really help you get any more out of watching the film.

In terms of DVD extras are a series of interview clips with individual cast members, but not including Allen and Stone, which would probably have been the most interesting ones of all, in keeping with our overall disappointment with the film.  But there is a trivia game, which will punish you for having paid so much attention to the film and sometimes confuse you as to whether the clips they show are telling you if you got it right or wrong.",1106870400,,4638,4.499404052443385
1365129,1,B00004WI55,"I moaned throughout this sad little stain on Woody's resume. I

guess I was hoping that it would eventually get righted, but it

never happens. Once upon a time Woody directed and starred

in Play It Again Sam, a bouquet to Casablanca, a film with one

of the best exit lines ever. Picking Up the Pieces ends with

one of the worst.

The execution of Kiefer Sutherland's character is unbearable to watch.

He is made a human pinata and beaten to death by men, women,

and children. There's no humor in it, vindication, carnal satisfaction.

Nothing. Alfonso Arau slipped so badly it's hard to believe the

same guy directed Like Water for Chocolate. I guess we all have

missteps. This is a trip, stumble, and fall.",1106438400,7,715,4.595238095238095
1365130,3,B00004WI55,"""Picking up the Pieces"" is one of the funniest movies I have seen in, well, a long, long time.

It is a movie with a rich tapestry of motives--beginning with the obvious reference to ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", then rollicking through a bewildering landscape of Catholic lores, superstitions and customs, which it mocks in a way that only a true and knowledgeable Catholic, such as Alfonso Arau, can. It will take an equally knowledgeable Catholic (yes, Catholics are not totally without a sense of humour) to enjoy its sting.

Woody Allen, who plays a Texan butcher and talks to himself and his dog a lot, is amusing in the highly symbolic Texan hat. David Schwimmer, of ""Friends"", plays an emotionally confused young priest, who has strayed from the path of righteousness. Kiefer Sutherland, who plays a corrupt Texas sheriff with a personal motive, is downright scary, and Maria Grazia Cucinotta is pleasingly sexy and exotic.

But what makes the movie so special and enjoyable is its setting amongst the ordinary people of a New Mexico town and their wild antics.

If you have ever seen ""Lust in the Dust"" or ""Serial Mom"", and liked them, you will like this movie too, because it is of a similar genre.

The movie falls flat on a couple of occasions, unfortunately including the final comment made by the departing Texan butcher (Woody Allen), which, I think, is out of place--artistically and semantically. I'd go for something more lofty.",1104624000,5,1447,4.889795918367347
1365131,3,B00004WI55,"Although this often execrable, cheaply punning (e.g., ""see"" ""si""), monolingual (the devil's!) monstrosity is easily among Woody Allen's worst (if not his worst) it is still, not so surprisingly, better than most films. That is because despite its socially unredeeming ploys (e.g., sex in church, a slattern-wife's severed bird-flipping hand that grants miracles such as big breasts and a dirt-scraping penis to a midget of a darker hue; and a poor Jimi Hendrix copy who sings obnoxious songs) it is kind of fun to look at the cast tramp through the mock New Mexico town El Nino. The end of the film, from which Allen with seeming genuine hostility draws the sermonizing moral that God seems to be saying ""if you can't take a joke go .... yourself,"" is symptomatic of the film's comic misfiring and lack of subtlety. Some T, but little A although I confess I fell asleep in the middle. My favorite part was the recycled Lenny Bruce joke that the Jews didn't really kill Jesus, it was a party that got out of hand. Some of the bits with Kiefer Sutherland as a state trooper were also good. Allen, who plays a magician-butcher who cuts his pretty wife (Sharon Stone, good job) in half with a buzz saw to begin the show, near the end comes to confess his crime prefacing his remarks with the confession that he has never confessed before because he is Jewish. But what are the many scenes of psychoanalysis depicted in his films if not confessions by another name? I think this movie actually has a serious intent that was compromised by commercial expectations and Allen's aesthetic choice to make it a complete farce; it is clever, and better than watching Jim Carey pull faces, but lacks heart-as if Allen were seething with anger but had only the light, feathery pillows of commercially successful comedy available with which to vent his intense frustration (at Catholicism and religious hypocrisy in general, unfaithful women, cute guys, himself, death, unappreciative audiences, etc. etc.)",1054425600,5,1991,4.876106194690266
1365132,1,B00004WI55,"This was just a very bad film. It was rarely funny and downright painful to watch at times. Woody is way out of his element in New Mexico where this idiotic film is supposed to take place.
There is no question in my mind as to why this film never made it into theaters. It would have bombed in a big way. Even though there is a great cast, they don't have a good script to work with so the film falls right on its' face.

1365133,1,B00004WI55,"I don't shut too many movies off in medias res. I definitely didn't expect to shut off a Woody Allen film in that manner. But I had to, just so I didn't have to hear myself halfheartedly guffaw a third time while trying to extract some joy from this tepid, unfunny, fantastic-in-the-bad-sense film. Its not a Woody Allen film per se-someone else wrote it, thank goodness...stars galore populate the screen, and not one of them really does anything funny or quirky at all...Allen's cynical mutterings are stale, and they let Eddie Griffin talk, and not Andy Dick? Watch the interviews with the cast to see them try and say something good about what they just excreted...that's funnier than than the film itself! Bad, bad, unequivocally awful movie no matter what the ravers say, if you have any intelligence or taste at all, heed my admonition, you will waste money on this! Why don't you see Sleeper instead?",1030233600,3,908,4.789808917197452
1365134,1,B00004WI55,"Like some of the other reviewers, I picked up this movie because of the cast, particularly Woody Allen.  The one good thing about it is that it wasn't very long, and that I didn't buy it, but rent it cheaply from my local library.  Everything else about it is bad.
The premise is not bad as far as it goes.  Tex, a NY butcher (hopefully a kosher/halal one?) living in Texas marries a floozy who cheats on him at every turn.  He kills her, dismembers her and drives over to the New Mexico town of El Ni&ntilde;o to bury her corpse.  In the way, he loses a hand.  A blind woman stumbles over the hand and regains her vision.  The hand is delivered to the local church where, in spite of the opposition of the priest, it is displayed as the Virgin's hand.  It quickly confirms this reputation and transform's the windswept town into a tourist mecca.  One of the dead woman's lovers, an irritating Texas ranger, find out about the murder an tries to arrest Tex and confiscate the missing hand.  The local townspeople rebel, kill the ranger, release Tex, and keep the hand.  A parallel plot concerns the priest who has lost his faith and is in love with one of the local hookers.  The hooker first attempts to become celibate and then marries the priest.
So what's wrong with this picture?  Virtually everything.  It's not being away from New York that has killed Woody Allen's jokes, but the fact that he is no longe allowed to take center stage or to roam freely across his multiple obsessions.  Sharon Stone, as his adulterous wife and murder victim, must have been so stricken by the mediocre result that her name has been stricken from the marquee: one looks in vain for her name as the credits pass by (at the movie's end, rather than the beginning, which was surely no accident).  David Schwimmer is utterly unrealistic as a priest, instead playing again the bumbling and incoherent character that made him rich at ""Friends"".  Maria Grazia Cucinotta, as the obligatory hooker with a heart of gold is OK, although one wonders why she should fall in love with such a bland character as Schwimmer's priest.  Of course it's possible (beautiful women are notorious for their rotten taste in partners) but it doesn't make for a funny movie.  Kiefer Sutherland, as the Texas ranger, is even good rather than OK, since he conveys a sense of menace and aggression whenever he appears on the screen.  Contrary to the rest of the cast, he stands for something, and has a personality, a rare commodity in this movie.  Three actors who play a priest, a nun and a Franciscan monk on a mission from the archbishop to authenticate the supposed holy relic are ludicrous rather than funny.  Stupidity is not funny.  Clumsiness may be funny (witness Laurel and Hardy), but only when redeemed by some endearing trait (such as friendship or loyalty).  These characters are cyphers.  They are nothing more than authority figures to mock, and not even that at times.
Other reviewers have commented on the film's disrespect for religion and priesthood.  That's not the problem.  Humour, like love, forgives all.  The movie just isn't funny, and so its vulgarity and crudeness are unjustified.  With no less than 3 major actors (Allen, Stone and Sutherland) and a great or at least distinguished support cast (Cucinotta, Schwimmer, Drescher, to name a few) it is much less than the sum of its parts.  Vulgarity and lewdness are not funny by themselves, but only as part of a reasonable portrayal of human foibles.  In this movie genitalia, breasts, profanity and lewdness are in fact substitutes for a plot or for well-rendered characters.  This sort of thing may work (more or less) in ""gross-out"" films intended for the 13-year old set (such as ""American Pie"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" or the ""Scary Movie"" series) but it doesn't in a movie intended for adults.  You'd have more fun drinking yourself blind while reading P.J. O'Rourke.",1029456000,9,3907,4.723781388478582
