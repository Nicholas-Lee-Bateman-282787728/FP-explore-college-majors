8049468,5,B0007NMKVC,This is a great movie that offers a fascinating glimpse into the last days of the GDR regime. The DVD also contains a lot of very informative documentaries and interviews on this historical period.,1272585600,,197,4.823529411764706
8049469,2,B0007NMKVC,"This movie was interesting for the first 15-30 minutes.  After that, I began to wonder why I should care about these characters.  It was so-oo-oo slow!!

I will say that it did provide some insight into what life in East Germany was like.  But it was one view, only.  There was no attempt to provide any variation or a larger view outside of the main character's life.

The most interesting part of the movie for me was the disintegration of the main character's marriage. To me, that made the most sense since I found the ranting angst of the architects to be rather thin and repetitive.",1261958400,,588,4.5
8049470,4,B0007NMKVC,"This movie gives a believable portrayal of the peculiar challenges faced by an East German architectural team (in late-1980s East Berlin as I recall), superimposed on the degeneration of the main character's marriage.  The story is sad but the details and plot elements are consistent and believable.  The connection of the protagonist's difficulties to the constraints imposed by the inescapable momentum of the state economic machine is thought-provoking.  Overall, I highly recommend the movie.  It gives the viewer a plausible chronicle of the downfall of both the personal and professional life of a good, honest man in the GDR during the late 1980s.",1173225600,3,655,5.330097087378641
8049471,3,B0007NMKVC,In the closing days of the DDR a group of young architects are chosen to design a multi-use plaza.  Although their concepts are cutting edge they fall outside the restrictions - so opens up the question on freedom of design versus what they are 'employed' to construct.  If this were not set in the DDR it would simply be a film about arichetects going beyond their assignment - but because it has a Socialist setting is is wrongly interpreted as an oppression of human rights - think outside the square you are commissioned to design!  As a footnote - I'm sure the artistic additions would not be welcome in any plaza East or West.,1125100800,2,632,4.526315789473684
