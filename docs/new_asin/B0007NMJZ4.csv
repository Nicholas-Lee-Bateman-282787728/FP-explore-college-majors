I was so thrilled at the quality of the DVD. It is crystal clear and the sound is great. My only gripe is that the company that produced the DVD redubbed the line where Emma Goldman says ""Women and Women!"" to ""Men and Women"" I hate when they do stuff like that. Otherwise, a must own for any theatre geek like me!",1498953600,,447,3.977777777777778
8049396,5,B0007NMJZ4,Many enjoyable old tues tunes I never heard before among many I am familiar with. Imaginative staging and production values.,1496275200,,124,5.25

8049399,4,B0007NMJZ4,"I had always wanted to see this show. The cast was a favorite ensemble of Broadway legends who may not have had a national following but were beloved by theatre folks. The string of songs from the turn of the century [1900 right?] are nostalgic and at times captivating. Other times, well lets just admit that tastes can change in a hundred years. Personally, I love stories about immigration. The show was obviously shot on a sound stage and not a real theater. The sets look a bit sparse and even tacky. In the end it is talents like Lynn Thigpen that make this a great archival piece. I would love to see a high school drama department take this on!",1414713600,,652,4.396694214876033
8049400,5,B0007NMJZ4,"This play is a classic featuring Ragtime music and a wonderful story about 5 very diverse people coming to America. Scott Joplin music and style throughout, along with other classic, turn of the century style songs.  Love this simple, lovely musical.",1400889600,,250,5.097560975609756
8049401,5,B0007NMJZ4,"I have been in two productions of this show, and it's one of my favorites.  The original cast is terrific, but I wish they'd performed in front of a ""live"" audience.  That's not Amazon's fault though; the production was available, and it really is great!",1378857600,2,254,4.622222222222222
8049402,4,B0007NMJZ4,"I saw this show on B'way 35 years ago, so this DVD was a real find for me.  It's not a well known show but is well done and good watching.",1374537600,,138,3.4516129032258065
8049403,5,B0007NMJZ4,Another show I missed on Broadway. Glad I was able to get it on DVD. A great addition to the Broadway collection!!,1233187200,3,114,4.2272727272727275
8049404,5,B0007NMJZ4,"this cabaret type performance features five incredibly talented singers/dancers in multiple roles. there is no plot. songs from the 1880s and 1890s and dialogue frequently based are quotations are used to create a suggestion of american society in the gilded age and the experiences of emmigrants, blacks, politicians and performers.

if that sounds dull, think again. the talented cast creats more excitement than can be described, and the selection of songs is inspired--the emotions range from light-hearted to melancholy to bitter to optimistic. there is some quite good dancing, some very good physical and verbal comedy, and some clever set decoration.

if you like theater, you won't be disappointed in the way that the performance was filmed. there are no cutesy, i-such-a-clever-director shots. you could almost be sitting third row center.

the voices are extremely good--two are fantastic. the acting is first rate.

i saw this film version years ago before i got a video recorder. when i learned it was released on dvd, i ordered it immediately. it's even better than i remember. i couldn't recommend it more highly.",1147046400,14,1128,5.25
