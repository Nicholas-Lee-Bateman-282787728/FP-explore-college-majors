7891224,3,6305508011,"DUSTY'S TRAIL (1973) featured two veterans of 1960's sit-coms. Bob Denver (THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) and Forrest Tucker (F TROOP!) starred in this short-lived western/comedy about a stage and wagon headed to California that get separated from the main train, thanks to our hero, Dusty (Denver). The regular cast also included William Cort (Andy Boone), Jeannine Riley (LuLu McQueen), Lori Saunders (Betsy McGuire), Ivor Francis (Carson Brookhaven) and Lynn Wood (Daphne Brookhaven).

The parallels to GILLIGAN's ISLAND were everywhere on this Sherwood Schwartz creation (yes, he thought up Gilligan, too). The Skipper's counterpart here is wagonmaster Callahan (Tucker). There's a wealthy couple (the Brookhavens), a glamor girl (Lulu), a wholesome gal (Betsy) and yes, a brainy guy (Andy). The character mirror-imagery may actually be the funniest thing about the program, which lasted 26 episodes before biting the dusty trail for good.

The following list includes 1 to 10 viewer poll ratings, episode numbers, original air dates and guest stars.

7891225,1,6305508011,The movie the wackiest wagon train in the west was wacky!  It is pathetic if you want a realistic if not half normal view of a wagon train.  Their tricks are basic and jokes didn't really tickle my funny bone.  It is so ridiculous it would be good for a hearty laugh.  Its acting is poor but then again I'm a tough critic after watching John Wayne movies all my life there was no comparison.  I never care to watch this movie again and don't recommend it by any means it's on my worst movie list- but then again in could strike others differently.,1024272000,,547,4.221153846153846
