8289822,5,B001CUB948,"This program has little to do with diplomacy or policy, and a great deal to do with what the war in Viet Nam looked like through the eyes of the groundpounders -- the Marine rifleman, the Navy corpsman, the Army nurse, and others who found themselves in harm's way. It has both archival footage and interviews with the Marines and others 35 years afterwards (the program was apparently made in 2005).
I've seen a lot of footage about VN over the years, but this one had me glued from the outset. This is what the war really looked like to the guys who fought it, and those who cared for them.
You might also catch this (with commercial interruptions) on the Military Channel (now American Heroes channel).",1480291200,,705,4.559055118110236
