5932665,5,B00EPG9HEK,An inspiring story about not just a cycling team but an entire nation pulling themselves up. Beautiful scenery and commentary. This film is a lesson in a country's history that we can learn from and use in our own lives. Excellent directing and editing!!,1384214400,4,254,4.795454545454546
5932666,5,B00EPG9HEK,"When the bicycling team from Rwanda entered the Olympic Stadium in London in 2012, Im sure many viewers scratched their heads as Rwanda never had such a team before. How it came about, and why, is beautifully in this brief 85-minute documentary by direct T.C. Johnstone. I love documentaries (which is obvious from the many Ive reviewed here on Amazon) and Im always fascinated by the process, and the gamble that directors (and the producers of course) take when starting a project. These films are made in real time and, unlike a scripted drama, the director has no idea where the story will lead, or even if there is a story there.

Johnstone, a bike rider himself followed cycling legend Jock Boyer as he moved to this war-ravaged African country to help train the first-ever Rwanda National Cycling team.  The men he started with didn't even have adequate equipment at the beginning and there was often a clash in cultures or problems with language. The film was on a tight budget and yet Johnstone didn't know how long it would take to film. But he got it done and its an endearing film as well as an exciting one.

The folks at First Run Features (the distributor of the DVD) went the extra mile (no pun intended, really) by adding as, a bonus feature, an hour long three-part Behind the Scenes documentary. Unlike most (now-requisite for DVD release) Making of  films, this one does not repeat scenes you have seen as filler. This was a real-time story made as the filming progress ed until its final release. Its narrated by Johnstone. So if youve seen the main film when it played a film festival  or, maybe, in a theater  you might want to get the DVD to see this background story. It added a lot to an already engrossing film for me.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5932667,5,B00EPG9HEK,"Incredibly moving, and best of all true.  I saw this movie in the theater as part of its traveling tour and had to buy it for myself.  I had no idea of this story before I saw the movie, but I am now a supporter of the team and follow them on Facebook.  Their struggles -- and their triumphs -- continue today.

8608043,5,B00EPG9HEK,"After violence in Rwanda has occurred some folks go there with the idea that they will introduce bicycle racing to the country in an effort to try to  bring something good to/from the country. A former successful cyclist with a criminal past joins the venture. (Sounds like a possible movie idea such as 'Cool Runnings'.

Features their training and some success, then they leave the country to compete elsewhere to see what skill level they have, they gain more riders. Eventually their fellow countrymen  think they have $ and that appears to draw in unsavory characters. Insightful, follows as they aspire for the ultimate goal. Follows them for about five years. Insightful extras. Some sub-title.",1460851200,,701,5.078260869565217
