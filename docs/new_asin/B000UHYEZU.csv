8213302,1,B000UHYEZU,"I was looking forward to learning through video instead of the mountain of books I have. Unfortunately, the production quality of this product is detrimental to the value of its content.

While there are several techniques that would be beneficial to amateur film makers, they are overshadowed by grainy video, noisy and choppy audio, tragic 3D models and animation, and painful narration.

The narrator speaks in monotone, often during stretches of black video. The topics are presented extremely briefly with little explanation or elaboration as to the why of the technique. Topic titles and other phrases are repeated frequently. Motion graphics and CG animation are choppy and overly simplified.

I understand that someone put time and effort into this product. Sadly, they did not do enough research on production before trying to teach the material presented. ""Professional"" refers to the topics covered, not the value of this product. Buy something else to teach yourself filming techniques.",1265846400,,998,5.384615384615385
8213303,5,B000UHYEZU,"I first bought this because it was a DVD rather than another printed book. This DVD helped me understand how transitions really worked from both camera and story perspective. I wanted to learn the tricks to shooting with better style so my productions would be more interesting than talking heads on lockdown (camera on tripod). All of us have different experiences to draw upon when learning something new, but in film making I had none yet.

I watched the well made Cinemaker DVD set and Lloyds ""Make Your Own Damn Movie"" DVD kit without learning any hands-on techniques. Both are clip montages hammered together to get you motivated with some management advice, no real techniques shown there. ""Professional Film Making Secrets"" (PFMS)says you will learn how to create better video - and it delivered at least ten times it's purchase price. I gave five stars because it did what it promissed by teaching actual techniques which I was able to practice for several weekends. It's been a keeper in my DVD training collection for over a year. It will take time to actually practice everything on this disk.

Truly amazing how an industry of visual story-telling cinematographers can't seem to deliver any good training pieces other than boring blah-blah books or talking head narrations. Does anyone else appreciate the how-to style of ""This old house""? PFMS producer Mark Holmberg does. Seeing it done beats reading about it, so I would say too many touted training aids are self gratifying productions genetically related to what falls out the backend of a dog. This DVD uses to-the-point video clips plus simple animation examples in a visual how-to format. PFMS does a darn better job teaching compared to others who just hammer you with words on the subject. Why do all the books use mere words when they preach using story-boards to tell a story? Too much theory while I have a film that needs to be made right now. I think the author/producer did a great job SHOWING ME what I need and how it's done. Kudos Mark.

NOTICE TO INDUSTRY: If everyone did more SHOW ME HOW productions like this we'd have an entirely new level of growth. So stop talking and show us how it's done step by step. Actual net knowledge gained from Mark's tiny DVD production exceeds all lectures or talking head interviews.

Semper fidelis,

8213304,1,B000UHYEZU,"I have to hand it to the guy who threw this one together. He has a lot of gall! In this DVD he purports to reveal ""secrets of how to make ""professional"" film. Yet the production and ideas in this amateur--no, worse than amateur--tutorial are so bad as to be laughable had I not wasted [...] or whatever on it. Serious about learning indy film-making I have bought dozens of books and DVD's on the subject. This is easily the worst.",1246233600,3,431,4.333333333333333
8213305,3,B000UHYEZU,"The quality of the audio is poor, if you're talking about professional film-making you could think you will see a  very professional finished dvd, but has some lack of quality.
About content has some good tips for film making, but sincerely I was expecting much more.
Its a good reference for begginers.",1222128000,2,303,4.826923076923077
