8087628,5,B000BJS4OE,"I'm pretty stunned by the only other review of this DVD, which gives it 1 star. I loved this DVD from the start. Frank Lee has a delightful relaxed style and the choice of music is interesting - they're tunes worth learning. It's perhaps not for complete beginners, because Frank teaches more by doing than by explaining every note. So that makes it a DVD where you'll hit pause and repeat a lot, as you follow along. Nothing wrong with that.

As well as great tunes (I love ""Half-shaved"") in a variety of tunings, Frank shares a bunch of exercises and techniques I found very helpful for improving my playing, and then rounds it out by playing a couple of tunes with other musicians so you get the feel of the banjo in context.

All in all, I thoroughly recommend this DVD. If you know enough to already tune your banjo and figure out where the notes are, you're ready for it.",1392163200,,877,4.407407407407407
