I saw the first airing of the TV movie when it first came out and off and on for several years have tried to find it, then voila it showed up on Amazon. Everything  I can say about this transaction is good, good packaging, quick delivery, good price and excellent condition. Watched the movie as soon as it came and am still wondering about the mothers attitude about the beating and murder the same as when I first saw it. Good story, thanks to whoever is responsible for getting this to me in such a timely manner. I highly recommend this seller.",1367452800,,612,4.321739130434783
7865137,1,6304219601,The movie was mesed up...would not work but 5 mins here and there clearly. It rolled and sound constantly in and out. I really wanted this movie to be added to my collection because it is a great movie and story that I remeber happening in our small little home town. I am really dissapointed in my purchase.,1358467200,,308,4.327586206896552
7865138,4,6304219601,"I saw this when it first aired, and then again as a repeat on Lifetime or something. It's really quite good I thought. The actors for Chris Pritchard and James Upchurch were very intense I thought and did really well. Ed Asner is always fun to watch too... anyway its a great movie. And for some clarification because none of the other reviews mentioned it... yes this is the one where the kids get all whacked out on drugs, alcohol, and D&D to go off one of the kids parents. It's portrayed well in this film... its just sad that its true.",1060905600,,540,4.303921568627451
7865139,5,6304219601,"I saw the movie first, then read the book, they were both good.
The acting by Blythe Danner was fantastic as Bonnie Von Stein.
The other reviewer who said it was disappointing, learn how to spell before you submit a review.",1019347200,,223,4.463414634146342
7865140,4,6304219601,"The novel by Joe McGinness kept me up all night, and the miniseries kept me just as involved.  A North Carolina woman is attacked in her sleep and her second husband is fatally wounded by an unknown assailant.  She recovers and is released from the hospital, but her nineteen year old son is acting awfully strange.  Gripping and intense, and sure to put a lump in your throat.  Another book about this case is ""Blood Games"" by Jerry Bledsoe.  Look for a young David Arquette, and real life mother and daughter Blythe Danner and Gwyneth Paltrow play mother and daughter here.",985219200,10,575,4.653465346534653
7865141,4,6304219601,"I thought this movie was very well done.  I was a neighbor of the family that this happened to and there at the time this took place.  With only 2 roads seperateing the house where this took place and my house, I know what  the actual feelings of fear were, and the movie seemed to fit right in with  what actually took place.  The movie was great, and I continue to watch it  every chance I get.",955670400,8,396,4.077922077922078
