8012693,1,B0001HLT6G,"Unprofessional collage of news images on November 22, 1963; amateurish in production. There is no DVD cover or indication of contents; it's like a copy a friend might have made without authorization. IMHO the only thing to be said in favour of this product is that it represents one news network's coverage of the events as they happened, but I found it a waste of money.",1454198400,,371,4.636363636363637

8012696,5,B0001HLT6G,"SO many lies with some truth put in.

The rich and powerful still own each and every one of us. Look at what happened to the only President to stand up to them.
They blew his head apart, while emory roberts (head of our president's secret service detail for that day) set him up and sat back and watched it happen. I wonder how much it costs to buy an agent. roberts even called back a agent that was going to help, after our president was hit, by the 2nd bullet. The first one missed.
johnson knew too, look at the smile on his face, in the motorcade. He knew exactly what was going to happen. He and his oil buddies in Texas got together, (The BU#@ Family) to figure it out.
THEY WANTED THEIR WAR IN FING VIETNAM. Johnsons carreer was over, and he wanted to be President, (No matter the cost)That's why Johnson was covered and pushed down by Rufus Youngblood, (a honest agent) after he ""saw some commotion in the President's car"". He leaped out of the front seat, and covered johnson. After he had johnson covered and safe, he heard the final two shots. It's all in his report. How did he leap over the back, of johnsons car while the other agent's behind, and in Kennedy's car did nothing.
Then about the agents in the front seat of the presidential car, The president, said quite clearly ""My God, I'm hit"" before he passed out. Then the driver practically stops, and looks back, like he is waiting......... ""Oh there it is, the kill shot. Punch it."" Almost like he was expecting it. They LET our President get assassinated! Then emory roberts radios back to johnsons car ""They got him. They got him."" (interesting choice of words).Watch this and learn a little, about how we lost our country.
John Kennedy was an incredibly brave soul, so was Bobby.
More than one of us knows what is really going on with our country, and how we lost it, so many years ago. Study and decided for yourself. Everything is out there.
But stand up and tell the American people the truth, and they (the ones really in charge) will KILL you. (Make it look like anything. (Heart attack, car accident, lone gunman) WE better wake up.
They want a bunch of uniformed, obedient workers, that believe all the crap they tell you.
And don't forget to pay your taxes so they can waste our hard earned money, with NO accountability..",1327276800,,2304,4.459715639810427
8012697,5,B0001HLT6G,"""Part 2"" of ""The Kennedy Assassination"" begins approximately 140 minutes after President John F. Kennedy had been slain on the streets of Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. This 2-hour DVD contains originally-broadcast ""live"" news reports from the NBC-TV archives, with newsmen Chet Huntley, Frank McGee, Bill Ryan, David Brinkley, and Robert MacNeil, among others.

By the time Part 2 of this DVD series gets underway, JFK's death had already been announced to the NBC audience around the country. Part 2 focuses on the Dallas manhunt for the assassin, reflections on the life of John Kennedy, and the arrival of the late President's body back in Washington, D.C.

These ""live"" television broadcasts from the NBC files are probably still very difficult to watch, even decades later, for some people who can remember vividly (and first-hand) that awful Friday in November of 1963, when the nation lost its young, 46-year-old President.

But these as-it-happened videos are obligatory for any serious collector of JFK-related video material.

RELATED FOOTNOTE REGARDING JFK-ASSASSINATION TELEVISION FOOTAGE:

Did you ever, just for fun, dream up your own ""Perfect DVD"" (or video) concerning a certain subject, TV show, or movie? That is to say, if you had the power (and studio control) to include anything you wanted to include on a super-duper, Special Edition DVD -- what would your ""Perfect DVD"" contain?

I've done this with regard to the JFK Assassination, and have invented my own personal ""Dream DVD Boxed Set"", containing the ""Ultimate Collection"" of JFK-related material pertaining to the Kennedy Assassination.

It's all in fun, of course, and I don't mean to make light of the serious and tragic subject matter that is the death of President Kennedy. But I truly would, indeed, like to have a great deal of the following items in my JFK collection -- especially all of the original TV network film and video footage pertaining to the assassination, which would be nice to have preserved on the high-quality DVD-Video format. Such ""complete"" November 1963 materials would also be valuable from both a research and historical document point-of-view.

Anyway, below is what my ""ULTIMATE JFK ASSASSINATION DVD COLLECTION"" would look like if I had my druthers and could afford its $4,500 asking price. <grin>

This is no doubt a DVD compilation that would almost certainly bankrupt the company distributing and/or producing it. But it's fun to dream about nonetheless. ......

8012698,5,B0001HLT6G,"Television became a responsible source of news to a shocked nation in 1963 when the news of John F. Kennedy's assassination was announced. Millions of Americans depended on the coverage of the three major networks at the time,ABC, CBS and NBC. There were no cable outlets in 1963. Watching the coverage with Frank McGee, Chet Huntley, David Brinkley and the rest of the NBC crew on this DVD is primitive compared to today's network and cable news outlets. Despite the horrible news,the coverage from all of the networks was first rate. I have the collection of all three networks in the first few hours of this American tragedy from November 22,1963. Watching this coverage makes  it feel like you were really there in the emotion and the shock of the fateful day in Dallas.",1192406400,4,774,4.776119402985074
