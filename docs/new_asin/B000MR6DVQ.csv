8171018,5,B000MR6DVQ,"I have the Great Courses streaming option (one year for $179), so I can watch whatever they have available, including Hazen's ""The Joy of Science.""  I usually watch five lectures per day (1/2 hour for each), so for this series of 60 lectures, the time to watch was 12 days.  Hazen is a well-spoken, well-dressed professor, with a friendly manner.  The lectures are well-organized.  He covers both physical science, including physics, chemistry, astronomy, and geology, and biological science.  The level is suitable for freshmen-level liberal arts majors  However, even a scientist or engineer might learn something; e.g., did you know that male birds have XX (or ZZ) chromosomes?  I could nitpick here and there; e.g., Hazen says that solid thermal conductivity is due to atoms colling with each other, which is not true--actually, electrons carry the thermal current.  But overall, there's not very much to complain about.  In the penultimate lecture, Hazen talks about various environmental issues, including ""global warming.""  I was almost going to dock him a star because I thought he was going to be a hysteric--but he did mention that the so-called warming could be due to variation in the solar energy output, and he did say that vegetation can soak up the CO2.  He did praise Paul Ehrlich, which is unfortunate, because Ehrlich's predictions have never been borne out (and he lost a big bet to Julian Simon).  Regardless, I still think this series is perfectly suitable for freshmen and intelligent laymen.",1480723200,2,1515,5.1138211382113825
8171019,5,B000MR6DVQ,"Hazen is an excellent instructor. I see why he is chosen to teach these courses. I love science, and am a hands on person. This series should be used to titillate peoples' minds and awaken their need to understand and learn about science and the world we live in. His explanations and the way this series is put together does just that. Highly recommended!",1388534400,7,356,4.578125
8171020,5,B000MR6DVQ,The DVD encapsulates the college classroom with its straightforward and informative style. The lectures clearly explain the various scientific subjects.,1359590400,8,152,6.65
