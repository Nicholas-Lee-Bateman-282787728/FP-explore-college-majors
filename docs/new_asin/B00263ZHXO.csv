8351807,4,B00263ZHXO,"This DVD teaches a cute routine for dance troupes using Isis wings. It would be great for girls' high school dance teams and more. If, however, you are just a solo dancer, you can still learn a lot of pretty moves from this DVD. In fact, you can very quickly learn a lot just in the very first part of the DVD before Amira moves on to teaching the routine. There were a few places where the video editing was choppy, but Amira repeats everything enough times that you can still figure out what's going on.

I did think that the male dancer should have been given an individual and unique dance part rather than just being treated as if he were one of the female dancers. It was distracting to see a male dancer whiz by with all the girls when he should have been featured with his own part. Plus, his costume was goofy, which made him stick out like a sore thumb. I would certainly not recommend the routine for a male and female troupe unless it were modified. The extra dance performance at the end included a more soloist part for him and his costume wasn't as bad, proving that you can have a male performer in your bellydance troupe if you just recognize that he has different qualities from the women and if you give him a part that fits.",1329782400,,1244,4.293617021276596
