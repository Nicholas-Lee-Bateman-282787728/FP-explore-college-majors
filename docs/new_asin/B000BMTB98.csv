8089075,5,B000BMTB98,"While it's long overdue for Marco Ferreri to receive the prestige treatment of a major box set - especially in America where his films are less known - it's unfortunate that five of the eight films are already available in English subtitled dvds released just a few years ago. But for Ferreri completists, the purchase of this set is mandatory due to the inclusion of THE SEED OF MAN and THE HOUSE OF SMILES - both making their U.S. DVD debut, as well as the first time these two films have been available with English subtitles ANYWHERE. And the black and white feature THE LITTLE COACH will be new for most viewers, since it's only previous U.S. release came over 10 years ago in a marginally released video edition. Also the film's bonus documentary MARCO FERRERI - THE DIRECTOR FROM ANOTHER PLANET - is authoritative and surprisingly comprehensive - with rare tidbits like Ferreri's lifelong diabetes and the attempted (and unsuccessful) suicide of actor David Warner during the shooting of Ferreri's film THE AUDIENCE.

But those with an appetite for more Ferreri after completing this set might want to check out the English subtitled editions of HAREM, LA CAGNA and DILLINGER IS DEAD available at amazon.co.uk. Also, dvd.it provides Italian dvds (without English subtitles) of rarer Ferreri films like THE CONJUGAL BED, THE APE WOMAN, WEDDING MARCH, and DIARY OF A VICE. And the Spanish site dvd.es is a source for Ferreri's STORY OF PIERRA, THE FUTURE IS WOMAN, and his final film NITRATE BASE.",1221177600,25,1502,4.890196078431373
