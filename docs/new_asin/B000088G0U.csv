7979829,2,B000088G0U,"I can't find anything to applaud in this misogynist film whose main theme is the degradation of Birkin in every possible manner. With Joe Dallesandro as his alter ego, Gainsbourg created a soul destroying scenario for each one of his characters. Birkin is reduced to a truly pathetic caricature of a woman in both looks and behavior. Her character is that of an impressionable unhappy girl/woman who is ambivalent about her masochistic nature, but not for long. Gainsbourg makes her desirable only to men who like women who resemble boys, which fits the writer's and director's (Gainsbourg's) aesthetic. There is no character development in this story but you wouldn't expect there to be. It's an 'art film' that focuses on the homoerotic and sadistic nature of desire. The sex scenes serve as a vehicle to demonstrate how one girl/boy woman went from screaming in pain from anal sex, to actually liking it in the end (no pun intended). There is no fun involved. Gainsbourg titled this 1975 movie with the name of the hit song he made with Birkin in 1969, and incorporated the melody at various times in the soundtrack. For someone lauded for his originality, how unoriginal is that?",1394928000,,1183,4.890547263681592
7979830,5,B000088G0U,"What a little gem of a movie.
This movie proves that a really interesting film can be made with a low budget.
The quirky love triangle makes one uneasy from the start and culminates in a surprise ending.
Very sexy movie with actors that are extremely attractive! Loved it!",1391990400,,272,4.571428571428571
7979831,2,B000088G0U,"This movie rang a bit false for a love story where one person may be more gender-fluid, and yet unable to get past certain issues after falling in love.  It seemed like there was this major underdevelopment in characterization.  And the ending was so abrupt, it seemed like it was forced.  I have watched better love stories involving complicated gender, bleak environments, and independent spirit.",1375228800,,398,5.092307692307692

Dark and forbidden things
Love and what a person feels they need too keep it
Not always the answer",1371945600,2,114,4.2272727272727275
7979833,5,B000088G0U,"I've got all of Paul Mauressey films. I specially have them because of Joe.  I cannot believe this guy did not make it to the highest levels of stardom.  The natural beauty and charisma he exhibits is out of this world.  I just discovered Joe since I was only a kid back in the sixties, but glad I found his film.  Right now I have ""Lonesome Cowboy"" on order, so will let you know my review once it arrives.  I just wish this would, and other Joe titles were released on region 1.  All his hard to find titles seem to be on pal format :-(.",1361232000,3,539,4.037735849056604
7979834,3,B000088G0U,"This movie was all the rage back when it was released. I bought the soundtrack then, but never had an opportunity to see the movie...until now. The scenery, photography, mood...and soundtrack...are beautiful; but what's with the putrid orange lipstick, on our female star, and on some of the men? In one scene, Birkin's lip colour is even augmented by white blush on her cheeks...how morbid! (Or, maybe that's the point?)",1350259200,,421,5.0285714285714285
7979835,5,B000088G0U,"Unfairly ignored by the public and the elites of the press at its release, this excellent movie by Serge Gainsbourg shows how Johnny Jane, a young girl of the Wild West, falls in love with Krasky, a truck driver that stops by the truck-stop she works at, and how their relationship evolvsd, especially when Padovan, Krasky's boyfriend, isn't too happy to see a woman steal his boyfriend.

As for the thematics of its movie, I really loved what Judy Birkin said, that this story was like the Little Mermaid, in the sense that Johnny Jane is ready to transform herself to fall in love with Krasky, even though it is suffering to her. This was an opinion I agreed to after watching this movie, which seemed closer to a fable than a romance.

Right from the first scene, Serge shows that he has a lot of talent for visual arts. Indeed, every shot is cleverly composed and the cinematography, even though it has a lot of surrealism, reminds us of the great westerns, a genre that the director adored watching. Even the music reminds us of this genre as we hear both his songs 'La ballade de Johnny Jane' and 'Je t'aime moi non plus' turned into melancholic melodies. Why, speaking of 'La ballade de Johnny Jane', it is interesting to hear this song right after the movie, for I think it is also Gainsbourg`s message to Johnny Jane after what she's been through during the story.

As for the actors, I think they all gave incredible performances, especially Jane Birkin, who gets to show, after playing in uninspiring french comedies in the seventies, that she's an excellent actress who can do daring roles.

In the end, I think it is an excellent movie that should have had a better reception at its release. Especially when the french director Franois Truffaut had nothing but praises.",1336435200,3,1782,4.647619047619048
