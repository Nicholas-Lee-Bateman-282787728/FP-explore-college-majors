2479995,4,B000E1MXTQ,"This new Laurel and Hardy release by Turner is a long awaited and fitting release for THE greatest film comedy team of all time.

The films have obviously been ""worked on"" and look the best I've ever seen them. The soundtracks also have benefited greatly as I found that they were quite tinny in the past and now they sound wonderful. It is amazing when watching movies of this age in such good condition how much it enhances the total experience.

After viewing this set I could only sigh and wish that MGM had had the foresight and retained the copyright on ALL the Boys feature films and shorts. That way we would have had good quality releases from well preserved prints instead of the crap that Hallmark(the current ""owners""of the majority of the Boys product)are giving us.

This two disc set has the movies ""Bonnie Scotland"" and ""Fra Diavolo"" on one and the extras on the other. The best thing on the  second disc is the wonderfully rare and tantalizing two-strip technicolour clip from ""The Rogue Song"".It doesn't last long but it certainly leaves one salivating for more. The documentary also included is called:""The Hollywood Shorts Story"" narrated by Chevy Chase. It is a rather banal documentary on the whole and really wouldn't normally be worthy of any mention if it wasn't for some of the rare clips that are included. It also makes you realize what a goldmine of film many of the major studios are sitting on

and makes you ask ""why aren't many of these short subjects being released today""?

Also included on the second disc are Laurel and Hardy(only)clips from ""The Hollywood Revue of 1929"",""Hollywood Party"" and ""Pick a Star"".I deducted one star from the rating for the very reason that we are given clips only. I cannot fathom why the entire films weren't released in toto!? The films merits are of no consequence because watching these scenes within the films themselves not only serves to enhance ones viewing(i.e seeing them in context)  but more importantly it impresses upon the viewer just WHY the Boys were included in them in the first place.

I can only hope Turner has the good judgement to release these films sometime in the future along with the only other product they hold copyright on,""Air Raid Wardens"" and ""Nothing But Trouble"".

Until then we have this set to enjoy and a generally praise worthy one it is at that. The films are in great condition and Turner is to be given high marks for their work on them. I thought they let the ""ball drop"" though on the second disc with a lacklustre documentary and clips only of the Boys from other movies(excepting the ""Rogue Song"") but they are in as good a shape technically as their counterparts on disc one and all in all this is a fitting release for the great Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.

2479996,5,B000E1MXTQ,"In answer to another poster's comments, this set does include the Laurel and Hardy segments from ""Hollywood Revue of 1929' (1929), 'Hollywood Party' (1934), and 'Pick A Star' (1937).  These are the best bits from these films.  'Holywood Revue' is painful to watch in its full form, and 'Hollywood Party' isn't much better.  'Pick a Star' is the only one that's worth watching.

While they are not the greatest L&H films, neither is BONNIE SCOTLAND, although ALL of Laurel & Hardy's work deserves to be released.

2479999,5,B000E1MXTQ,"This set has two Laurel and Hardy feature films. The first, The Devils Brother from 1933 has the boys, named Stanilo and Ollio, as bandits in the 1700's. They become servants to Fra Diavalo (the films original title), played by Dennis King. He wants to get money hidden in Thelma Todd's petticoat. Based on an Italian operata, Laurel and Hardy play their roles very well. James Finlayson also provides great support.

The second, Bonnie Scotland from 1935, has the boys traveling to Scotland to claim an inherintence, which turns out to be bagpipes and a snuff box. They accidently join a Scottish regiment, complete with kilts, and are sent to India. This film is marred by an romantic subplot, but Laurel and Hardy are funny when onscreen. James Finlayson again provides good support to Laurel and Hardy.

The second disc has a documentary about short subjects. I have not seen it, but it should be interesting.

All in all, looks like a good set. Hopefully sound and picture will be great. Good to see more Laurel and Hardy on DVD.",1136937600,17,1034,4.733333333333333

Hilariously funny.  They remain my favorite of all the comedy teams.  I love it when Ollie shows his frustration right into the camera, making us partners in his adventures with the lovable Stan.

This is a real gem for L & H fans and and shows the amazing advances that were accomplished in just a few years from the Silent films of the 20's. Not only was sound now included,but everything involved from the storyline to production,set design,photograohy and direction advanced at a lightning speed. The movie is set in Northern Italy and is really unlike anything most people think about when they think of the entertainment and humor that this remarkable duo are remembered for. Onec it was pure slapstick,but now it's slapstick plus drama,and a whole lot more.

'Bonnie Scotland' is another fun film with James Finlayson -- he never comes out the better with his run-ins of with  pair, and this encounter continues the tradition. We're life-long fans of L & H and even joined one of their 'tents'  in the past.  So pleased to have this offered -- thank you, thank you!",1387324800,,698,4.1716417910447765

2480054,5,B000E1MXTQ,"About a year ago RHI Entertainment released a 10 DVD set of the Laurel and Hardy sound short subjects and features. While it is an amazing set some of the Laurel and Hardy features were not included. This set fills in two major gaps but also provides some delightful extras.

The two features, ""The Devil's Brother"" and ""Bonnie Scotland"" look and sound great.  Devil's Brother is one of the first of the Laurel & Hardy operetta film.  They supply comic relief never envisioned by the composer when this was a stage play. It is said Hal Roach was hoping this film would establish his studio as a contender in the feature film market. The production values seen here certainly are well above his previous efforts. Bonnie Scotland is a military comedy although as it opens there is little hint it will end up in this genre. This time L&H are the stars and are on screen for most of the film.

If you own the RHI set - it is highly recommended you add this set to your collection also.  The bonus features on this set make it even move valuable than expected. Included are all the L&H sequences from other feature films in which they appeared in either short sequences or cameos. Additionally, since this set comes from Turner, these is an option to begin the films with an introduction by Robert Osborne and to hear full length commentaries for both films. Also included is  a feature length documentary (narrated by Chevy Chase) covering the development and variety seen in short subjects and interviews with some of the performers who starred in these films.

No about the title for this review.  I had seen this film in stores where it was first released but chose not to buy it. A few months ago I discovered it was available for free loan at my local public library.  Once I had screened both of the DVDs in this set I knew this had to become part of my collection. If you love Laurel & Hardy as much as I do , search for a copy of this DVD and get it before there are no more to be had.",1343692800,6,1989,4.383152173913044

Their best films were the shorts (generally 20 to 30 minutes long) released by Hal Roach Studios"": silent films from 1927-29 and talkies from 1929-35. Anything else pales in comparison. These two films are OK, but rely too heavily on music and/or serious plots - Laurel & Hardy are little more than comic relief. Their scenes are pretty funny, but the serious plots are horribly boring.",1297555200,,731,4.545454545454546
2480062,5,B000E1MXTQ,"This DVD collection is, at present, the best way to be introduced to the great comedy team of Laurel and Hardy on R1 DVD.

Laurel and Hardy made their bests films in the `20s (at the tail-end of the silent era) and the `30s (with a mix of short films and features) at the Hal Roach studio, but precious few of that great material is currently available on home video. Luckily, these two films, produced during their `30s heyday at Roach, ended up in the hands of a different rights holder - who were more than happy to produce this extras-loaded DVD set.

The Devil's Brother is a comic version of an old operetta with Laurel and Hardy as bumbling servants of notorious bandit Fra Diavolo (""The Devil's Brother""), and Bonnie Scotland has the boys traveling to Scotland and accidentally joining the Queen's army and being shipped off to India. The Devil's Brother is a better film overall, with some good acting from the rest of the cast and interesting subplots, while Bonnie Scotland has a lame romantic subplot but (in my opinion) funnier Laurel and Hardy scenes. Both feature Laurel and Hardy mainstay James Finlayson in nice supporting role and between both of these movies you can get a pretty good idea of what Laurel and Hardy are all about.

This set has an introduction by TCM host Robert Osborne, commentaries on both films, and theatrical trailers on disc one. Disc two features a feature-length documentary on theatrical shorts in American cinema which covers Laurel and Hardy and the entire Hal Roach studio as well as a lot of other stuff, but my fav special feature is over half a dozen clips of Laurel and Hardy's guest starring roles in some early `30s flicks. These were films with little real plot and featured dozens of cameos from famous folks doing a single scenes or comedic bits, films made up entirely of cameo appearances. While these films might be a chore to sit through by themselves this DVD just takes out the Laurel and Hardy comedy routines - which can, by the way, be viewed with no knowledge of the rest of the movie. They're a joy to watch.

Here's hoping that soon after this review is made (late 2010) the rest of Stan and Ollie's films get a first-class home video presentation.

(Edit)

A better L&H DVD set came out in late 2011. Laurel and Hardy: The Essential Collection collects all the talkie shorts and features not already released (which only excludes 3 films). It's the go-to set for someone who wants the best of Laurel and Hardy, collecting shorts like The Music Box and films like Way Out West - you know, the really good stuff!

... but after you buy The Essential Collection, this TCM set is the follow-up buy!",1291680000,6,2675,4.6308016877637135
2480063,5,B000E1MXTQ,"Showcasing two of Laurel & Hardy's Hal Roach-produced MGM comedies, this collection is a joy to watch. My favorite of the two is ""Fra Diavolo"" (The Devil's Brother), arguably the best of L&H's ""operetta"" features. This stylish period piece has wandering souls Stanlio & Ollio trying to impersonate the notorious singing bandit ""Fra Diavolo"" (played with impish tongue-in-cheek flair by Dennis King), only to get caught by the real bandit himself. He ultimately spares their lives (after an amusing bit in which he sentences Stan to hang his friend Ollie) & makes them his servants. The bulk of the plot has King (in his civilian aristocrat guise) romancing & separating a fair lady (the great Thelma Todd) from her loutish husband (James Finlayson) and especially her valuable jewels. The great news is that the plot never intrudes on L&H's screen moments as they're given plenty of elbow room to clown. It's chalk full of wonderful L&H moments: Stan driving Ollie crazy with the ""earsie-kneesie-nosie"" game; the boys siphoning wine from a barrel, with less going in the jug & more into Stan, with the expected results; and the boys caught in a laughing fit, amazingly milked for all its worth.
""Bonnie Scotland"" was the team's official farewell to shorts. This feature film is handsomely produced (the Indian prince's mansion is particularly impressive) and begins appropriately with the boys making their screen entrance as a Scottish blacksmith hammers out their theme song on an anvil. Stan is heir to a fortune & the boys arrive in Scotland to collect. True to L&H's luck, they are handed nothing but a bagpipe, and their luck only worsens as they proceed to nearly destroy their lodgings & accidentally sign up for the Scottish army, which is en route to India. The film is an uneven mix as the boys are obligated to share screen time with a complicated boy-girl romance. But when they are on screen, they produce some of the funniest moments, particularly while exasperating their easily-combustible sargeant (James Finlayson again, uttering his trademark ""DOH!"").
Included is some interesting commentary from recent film critics & historians about the team. While fans have been frustrated that no one has given the team their ultimate tribute with an extensive & ""official"" film collection (as they've been re-packaged to infinity), this small DVD collection will certainly do!",1283990400,4,2386,5.1048593350383635

Bonnie Scotland is the other feature and it is good Laurel & Hardy. They go to Scotland to claim an inheritance left to Stan that is not exactly what the boys are counting on. Thinking that they are signing to get a free suit they actually enlist in the Scottish Army where they find themselves in India. The special features are great. The Hollywood Shorts story narrated by Chevy Chase highlights almost all short subjects also clips of the boys in Hollywood Revue of 1929,Hollywood Party 1934,Pick a Star 1937 and a fragment of them in the Rogue Song from 1929 in color this the only surviving piece of this movie,also in color A Tree in a Test tube. the restoration is excellent!

2480065,4,B000E1MXTQ,"""The Devil's Brother"",
A pleasant and fun film. There are a couple of good songs. One good song by the lovely Lucile Browne. One good song by the bandit later on. Casting the actor / singer as the bandit to sing the song was less than ideal, because we do not like the bandit. However, the song is still good and enjoyable; an opera-like song. The regiment of soldiers sing well too. The film has a good ending, which the writer set up well earlier in the film. The pace slows too much midway, not boring, just not lively enough, but picks up for a good end. Some clever plots.

""Bonnie Scotland"",
Pleasant and fun. Stan and Ollie get into trouble with the army sergeant making the film worthwhile. James Finlayson plays the sergeant well. In silent-films, he learned saying it all with a look, showing here his frustration with Stan and Ollie, and his tit-for-tat getting even, which the three took to greater heights in their silent-film great ""Big Business"".

The young woman who plays in the romantic sub-plot has the face of an angel. The film does not go back to the romance couple after implying a happy ending. It does not hurt the film, but it is a missed opportunity.",1240876800,,1177,4.52112676056338
2480066,4,B000E1MXTQ,"O.K., I haven't purchased this just yet, but I trust that being under the ""Warner"" name, that it's got to be pretty good. But I want to see if there's a set that also includes ""Flying Dueces"" as well.
  But here's the great news for fans of the amazing duo!
I recently checked out the Amazon.uk site, and discovered the Universal Pictures 21-disc set. And, yup, I ordered it! But I had to through a differant British seller, (since some of Amazon's wouldn't ship to North America), or the ones that would, simply charged way too much. I ended up paying the standard 59 pounds (whatever that is U.S.), plus the mail delivery dinged me for $10 (Canadian, $7 U.S.?)which is pretty damned good for such an amazing boxset! I once even saw it on sale for 39 pounds! It has all of their best movies, all of their hilarious talking shorts, great silent shorts, interviews with Johnny Carson, and many other celebrities, colorized versions as well as the same features in their original black and white, and much more, all of the highest quality, the whole set being close to 70 hours in length!!
  But still. I want to get a few other movies, like ""Bonnie Scotland"" and ""Flying Dueces"" just to round out my collection.
  Finally, if you decide to get the wonderful Brit 21-disc collection (why the hell is it not available here?!), then you'll need to get something like a good quality multi-region dvd player like a Cambridge Audio DVD99 which may be a bit pricey, but incorporates the highest quality components and standards, as well as remarkable sound. Or research something similar like a Maranz or Oppo. Considering how long a high quality player will last, along with amazing sound and great quality picture, etc., it makes much more sense than buying several cheap dvd players, and plays both our Region 1 NTSC, and their Region 2 PAL discs beautifully! Then you can get European dvds to your heart's content, along with what you want over here.",1235001600,3,1946,4.675438596491228

2480068,4,B000E1MXTQ,"The Hal Roach film library, which includes the vast majority of Laurel and Hardy's material, has been largely ignored by its owners for years. Only a few features and shorts starring Laurel and Hardy lie outside of that collection. Warner Home Video owns the two features in this collection plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laurel-Hardy-Air-Raid-Wardens-Nothing-but-Trouble/dp/B000HWZ4CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laurel & Hardy - Air Raid Wardens / Nothing but Trouble</a>, which were actually made at MGM. The two feature films in this collection are products of Hal Roach Studios, but WHV obtained the DVD rights, probably a product of the fact that Hal Roach products were released through MGM at the time.

Laurel and Hardy are not a comedy team where you can just wander into any feature film they did and get a full appreciation for it. First, IMHO, you need to watch their comedy shorts. Start in the silent era if you can, but definitely try to view their evolution in their sound shorts through the early 1930's. Once you've got a feel for their subtle brand of humor, then you can appreciate the two feature films in this set more. ""Bonnie Scotland"" is more of your typical Laurel and Hardy film, if there is such a thing. ""The Dev il's Brother"" is most unusual with all of the music involved. This was something Hal Roach liked, but Stan Laurel always thought it threw the comedy off of its pacing, and I think time has proved Stan right. If you are a fan of Hal Roach shorts you'll recognize and appreciate  Thelma Todd in ""The De vil's Brother"" and James Finlayson in ""Bonnie Scotland"".

 Added Attractions: The Hollywood Shorts Story - This is a good featurette, but it doesn't focus on Laurel and Hardy at all. Maybe this had to do with WHV's limited rights to Laurel and Hardy material.
* Commentaries by aficionados Richard W. Bann and Leonard Maltin - These were very well done and enhanced the films greatly.
* Introduction by Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne - The same high quality introduction you'd get from Mr. Osborne if he were introducing these films in primetime on TCM.
* Vintage Excerpts from:
 The Hollywood Revue of 1929 - Laurel and Hardy have a very short magic act here that isn't very good. This could just be because the pair were new to sound.
 Rogue Song - The whole film is lost. Only fragments remain, and you get one here that barely does more than prove that the boys were indeed in the film, a fact that was disputed for years.
Hollywood Party, and Pick a Star - The small guest spots that Laurel and Hardy had in these films.

Behind teh subplots, and inconsistent plot lines of lovers, devils brothers, and thieves, Laurel & Hardy are at their magical best.  Their scenes in both ""The Devil's Brother"" and ""Bonnie Scotland"" are filled with the charm and wit that made these comedians the best in their business.

Warner Brothers has definitely scored high for me.  The extras filled in this DVD include scenes from the various cameos they were in, as well as the only color extract known from ""The Rogue Song.""  Truly a treat for all Laurel & Hardy fans.

My only with is that Halmark would get on the bandwagon and release the rest of the films that they own.  Even Fox and MGM have now released their Laurel & Hardy movies (which were post-1940, and not the team's best films either).",1169078400,7,827,4.585034013605442
2480093,4,B000E1MXTQ,"Way back in the 80's there were only two Laurel & Hardy movies to be found on video tape; ""Utopia"" and ""Flying Deuces"", both released by a multitude of cheapy video companies. And then finally MGM/UA home video released a third, ""Bonnie Scotland"". This would be followed by CBS/FOX's Playhouse Video released a couple of their 20th Century Fox movies, and Nostalgia Merchant did us all a favor and released 9 volumes of their sound shorts ( one volume more and they would have completed the task ) as well as several of the Hal Roach L&H feature films.

It wasn't long before MGM /UA realized that L&H sold well on video. And it was just their luck that they had the video rights to 2 of their movies. So in the 90's ""Bonnie Scotland"" was re-released marked down from $70 to $20, an ""The Devils Brother"" was also given a release at the same price. These movies made such a profit that MGM/UA continued to release any L&H movies they could get their hands on.

As it turned out, Laurel & Hardy had made two movies for MGM studios after they split with Hal Roach studios. ""Air Raid Wardens"" and ""Nothing But Trouble"", while the stronger of their post Roach movies, were still regarded to be substandard. Ultimately that did not stop MGM/UA from releasing them, or putting such phrases as ""..hilarious..."" and ""...laughed packed 1944 film"".

MGM/UA continued to try to milk the L&H cash cow dry with two more video releases; ""Laurel & Hardy's Laughing 20's"" and ""Hollywood Party"". The former was another Robert Youngson composite movie released by MGM that is best remembered for preserving most of the pie fight from ""Battle of the Century"". The later was a 1934 MGM all-star disaster that featured Laurel & Hardy in only a few segments. But that did not stop MGM/UA from prominently featuring Laurel & Hardy on the videos box.

It would have been nice if MGM had continued and paid for the rights to release several other L&H movies, but at the time they were only interested in releasing the movies they already owned the rights to. Now nearly 15 years later Warner Home Video is once again re-releasing the MGM owned Laurel & Hardy movies on DVD. While this set only contains their two Roach features, good sales could see the re-release of all the MGM owned material. ( I would actually like to see a DVD release of ""Hollywood Review of 1929"" as I am also a Buster Keaton fan. The only other release of this movie on home video was part of an expensive Laser disc set with a lot of other early musicals I was not interested in. )Hopefully this could also result in a release of other Laurel & Hardy movies through Warner & TCM.

As for the movies in this set, they are not the best that Laurel & hardy had to offer. At the time ""The Devils Brother"" was made Hal Roach felt that they had to beef up the feature films with what was selling tickets at the time, namely romance and music. As in movies like ""Swiss Miss"",

""Bohemian Girl"", and even ""Babes in Toyland"", a sub plot revolving around a romance between two characters tends to take over the movie. As do singing numbers that do not involve Laurel or Hardy. They are by no means marginalized as Abbot & Costello were in many of their films, but the padding is still obvious. However, since Stan and Babe had less to do with the film it gave them more time to work out the gags in their individual scenes. And The Devils Brother does offer up a few comedy gems such as the ""Earsy-Kneesy-Nosey"" game ( which, by the way, quickly became a fad shortly after this film was released )

The plot is simple. L&H play Stanlio and Ollio, two failed bandit's in Europe around the 1700's. They are forced into service with Fra Diavalo, a notorious leader of a gang of bandits, after Stanlio and Ollio attempt to rob them. Disguising himself as a nobleman, Fra Diavalo infiltrates the home of Lord Rocburg and woos his wife in order to locate his money. A second sub plot is introduced where if Captain Lorenzo cannot capture the bandit Fra Diavalo he will never be able to marry his true love. Throughout the movie Laurel & Hardy are forced to help Fra Diavalo in his plot, but at the same time are interested in turning him in for the reward. Eventually they end up getting both Fra Diavalo and themselves caught and nearly shot by a firing squad. That is until Stanlio causes a distraction that allows them all to escape.

Bonnie Scotland, besides its name, barely takes place in that country. Stan & Olly travel to Scotland for a reading of a will where they are only left a snuff box. They end up enlisting in the Scottish army and for the bulk of the movie are in India. The sub plot here is one of Laurels relatives, Laurena MacLaurel, is brought to India by her guardian, and her boyfriend enlists in the same regiment as Stanly & Olly to be with her. In the end of the movie the subplot is abandoned without resolution as Stanly, Olly, and the boyfriend are all sent on a mission to infiltrate some insurgents. As they are about to be killed Stanly knocks over some bee hives which aids in their escape, but also sends swarms of bees to sting everyone. It is there the movie ends abruptly, leaving i=us to assume that somehow the romantic subplot was resolved, and at the same time not caring if it was or not. As in all the Roach movies, strong material from Laurel & Hardy, but ruined by dull padding with the lame subplot. And the second most misleading title in comedy history ( the first being ""Abbot & Costello go to Mars ).

The disks also include some good extras, including their segment from ""Hollywood Review of 1929"" as well as their segments from ""Hollywood Party"" and their scenes from ""Pick A Star"". I suppose this is MGM's way of saying they are not going to be releasing those films, but here is all the L&H footage so you are not missing anything. And I agree, it will now be hard for them to sell those movies at a latter date. ( then again, Hollywood Party also has segments by Walt Disney and The Three Stooges, so perhaps they could afford to still release it.)There is also the existing fragment of Laurel & Hardy footage from the otherwise lost ""Rouge Song"". But one puzzler is a documentary on short subject films. One would think that this is just included as filler. But since the extras also boasts the scenes from the other films mentioned, throwing this documentary in does not seem necessary. It is almost as if it was tossed in by accident and was meant for another DVD set. And who knows, maybe in the near future a box set of random short movies released by Warner Brothers will include a documentary on Laurel & Hardy as an extra.",1163894400,5,6619,4.459124690338563
2480094,4,B000E1MXTQ,"The material included on this two-disc set does seem more geared to serious fans as opposed to new or casual fans, but these films, while not as essential as the likes of 'Our Relations' or 'Way Out West,' still charm and entertain regardless, and aren't the type that would turn off a newer fan.  We should feel lucky that there have been so many releases of L&H films lately instead of complaining about what isn't getting released.  Besides, there's always the option of getting a region-free DVD player and paying a little extra to get the boxed set of their Hal Roach shorts and major features from amazon.co.uk, like I did, or buying the German Hal Roach set, which I've heard is just as great.

'Fra Diavolo,' aka 'The Devil's Brother' (1933), is a costume comedy and one of their comic operettas.  While I don't really care for this film too much, I can still really appreciate how well-made it is.  Like with just about any comedy group, one doesn't watch L&H to see secondary characters taking up a lot of the action and detracting attention away from the stars with a subplot that doesn't involve them enough!  Coupled with all of the songs, it's almost like one of their Fox films, although at least here they're not yet being relegated to almost supporting characters.  And it is a joy to see the always wonderful Jimmy Finlayson and the beautiful Thelma Todd, even in costumes and powdered wigs.  Dennis King, as Fra Diavolo, is also a delight to watch.  I basically like the film well enough when L&H are center stage, but not that much when they disappear and the secondary characters start taking up all of the action.

'Bonnie Scotland' (1935) also has them in the same situation, although at least here the secondary characters (some boring young couple) don't assume that large of an amount of time.  I prefer this one to 'Fra Diavolo.'  There are funnier gags and scenes, even though it's not quite at the level as their most classic features.  Jimmy Finlayson is also in this one, as the boys' commanding officer.  The first half of the film is great, though the second half goes downhill a little.  The boys being in the army had so much comic potential, particularly with Jimmy as their commanding officer, but it just wasn't utilised properly.  It's not that I find this a bad unsatisfying film the way other fans do, just that the execution is a little uneven, and it ends kind of abruptly, with no resolution of the subplot.

These two-disc sets from TCM always include a documentary in addition to the main features, and here that documentary is 'Added Attractions: The Hollywood Shorts Story.'  Yes, it would have been nice to have had a documentary focusing on the boys instead of on short subjects in general, but the documentary is still great.  It tells the rise and fall of the short subject, from the days when all movies were shorts, to the proliferation and popularity of the one- and two-reeler in the Teens, Twenties, and Thirties, to the different types of shorts and the different people who made them, and finally to what made them a dying breed in the Forties and Fifties, finally a complete thing of the past by the time the last short subjects department (at Columbia) closed up shop in the late Fifties.  It's actually kind of sad that now moviegoing is no longer as diverse as it was when short subjects were popular; instead of just going to see the one movie, viewers had a whole program, with newsreels, the main feature, travelogues, and short subjects from various comedians, really never knowing what one was going to get in addition to the main feature.

Extras include audio commentaries, introductions by TCM host Robert Osbourne, a fragment from the lost 1930 Technicolor film 'The Rogue Song,' their magic act scene from 'The Hollywood Revue of 1929,' trailers, their two scenes from 'Hollywood Party' (1934), and their three scenes from 'Pick a Star' (1937).  Most people who have seen these features in their full length say that they're not much to write home about, so it doesn't seem like that big of a loss that only the pertinent clips were included here, even if that means seeing them somewhat out of context.

Overall, this collection is a must-have for fans, and even has something to offer for newer fans.  Not all of their films can be top-notch classics, and it's ridiculous to complain about this product for what it's not rather that for what it actually is.  Stan and Ollie always shine and bring smiles to faces, even in their less-essential films.  That's how special and talented they were.  My only real complaint about this is how the discs are arranged in the box.  Instead of having one disc on each side, they're stacked so that they overlap somewhat, making it more difficult to remove them.",1160697600,46,4775,4.699879951980792

2480096,4,B000E1MXTQ,"This era of the DVD and competing new formats frequently brings us astonishments of riches (such as the ""Looney Tunes"" collections), but when it comes to Laurel & Hardy, we American fans must wax nostalgic for the good old Blackhawk Films days or dig around for the Hal Roach Studio's ""Lost Films of L&H"" DVD series. Just about everything else we're getting is crumbs.

This particular double-disk set from TCM is sort of a cake and crumbs combination. The cake is ""The Devil's Brother"" in a sharp print. It's a bit long in song, but it's been the least-available of the L&H operettas, and it has plenty of hearty comedy to ease the pain of the romantic stretches (and with Thelma Todd in those, they aren't that hard to take). A finger on ""fast forward"" may be required to get through ""Bonnie Scotland,"" in which the L&H material is interrupted by a storyline that would have been more at home in one of their later Fox features. Fortunately, TCM has saved us that trouble with ""Hollywood Party,"" ""Hollywood Review of 1929,"" and ""Pick a Star,"" which are represented with only their best moments: the Laurel & Hardy scenes.

2480100,3,B000E1MXTQ,"The Turner Classic Movies/Warner Bros. two-disc ""Laurel & Hardy Collection"" might temporarily pacify L&H buffs who have been begging for more of The Boys' work to be released on DVD, but it's unlikely to win any new converts to the L&H camp.

Although I feel that both of the feature films in this set -- 1933's ""The Devil's Brother"" (L&H's first ""comic opera"" movie) and 1935's ""Bonnie Scotland"" (a British-army pastiche) -- are not among The Boys' greatest movies, they have a lot of worthwhile comic moments, and the prints look beautiful, with a sparkling visual quality far surpassing that of the two shoddy L&H DVDs that have thus far been released by Hallmark (the company which currently owns the rights to most of the pre-1941 L&H movies).

This set's biggest debit is what we might call a lack of historical context. TCM's Robert Osborne does an introduction that not only provides just a perfunctory view of L&H's team history, it mentions nothing about the extras included on Disc 2.

Those extras include L&H's ""guest-starring"" clips from the features ""Hollywood Revue of 1929,"" ""Hollywood Party,"" ""Pick a Star,"" and ""The Rogue Song."" The latter, in particular, is given very short shrift. ""The Rogue Song"" was a Technicolor movie (quite a rarity in 1930, when the movie was released), and in fact, the L&H clip (from one of only two color movies that The Boys did) is the only part of the movie that has survived. (MGM's negative of the movie was destroyed decades ago in a fire.) Not only isn't this mentioned on the DVD, but while the other clips are identified as such, the DVD lists this clip simply as ""The Rogue Song,"" as though L&H's two-minute clip *was* the entire movie. (The clips themselves, it must be noted, are quite funny.)

This DVD set is nice enough but will probably be off-putting to the casual fan. Even L&H buffs are advised to read the synopses of these movies in Randy Skretvedt's delightful L&H biography, because you sure won't get much info from the DVDs.",1146182400,19,1997,4.763005780346821
