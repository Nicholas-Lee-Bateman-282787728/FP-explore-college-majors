He doesn't really discuss effects or equipment used by the band very much.  He explains the tuning of Korn's 7 string guitars and thats about it, nothing about brands, pick ups, etc (which is a big part of their tone)  and he gives a slight crash course on what effects to use (some of them the best I can tell aren't actually the effects Korn uses in their songs) but he does give you some basic tools.  For example, there are several Korn tones I can imitate with my BOSS Super Chorus pedal while they used 2 or 3 pedals combined.  Thats basically what this guy is doing, just giving you the tools to get by with.

Some of the riffs he arranges to be played by 1 guitarist instead of a duo, which is great for those who aren't playing with a buddy.  Some riffs I have seen were played in different positions than from what Korn plays them.  Not wrong, just different fingering.

Basically, if your intent with this DVD is to learn new things be it 7 string guitars, their tunings, effects, or new methods of playing you won't be getting your moneys worth I fear.  This DVD isn't made IMO for education but rather Korn fanatics.  Its more of a follow-along have fun imitating your favorite songs kind of thing.  You may pick up some new ideas here and there but don't expect to walk away like you just left a guitar lesson.",1303689600,,1582,4.226666666666667
