3846854,4,B0024IWKLS,"This movie is a good example of what happens when good acting and bad dialogue are mixed together (sort of like the entire Star Wars original trilogy). The result is: a pretty decent film. If you can look past the biggest story line faults (switching back and forth between two different time periods intermittently and without warning AND not explaining how J.T.'s father died), you might enjoy this movie. While there are some scenes which could be considered frightening to children (such as one character getting shot and another falling to his death off a cliff), it is otherwise a good family movie.

The character of young Christine is very annoying (I mostly attribute that characteristic to her voice). The older version, Aunt Christine, is the most interesting character in the film, as the two time period plots relate directly to her. Aunt Christine's appearance is slightly different in the final scene compared to the rest of the movie, although the twist at the end provides a loose explanation for this.

Ultimately, not exactly a popcorn movie, but still entertaining to watch at the end of the day.",1383350400,8,1116,4.930851063829787
3846855,3,B0024IWKLS,"It is an okay movie for the family, I would rate it okay for keeping my attention as long as it did",1382313600,2,99,3.5454545454545454
3846856,3,B0024IWKLS,"The acting was great, easy story. I found the scenery relaxing. Pleasant film to watch at the end of day.",1375142400,,105,4.3
3846857,4,B0024IWKLS,"I thought it was a wholesome and clean movie.  Not the most thrilling, but I think the acting was pretty good and the storyline as well.  Better than a lot of other movies that get put in this genre.  Simple, but good!  I recommend it.",1373673600,3,235,4.155555555555556
3846858,5,B0024IWKLS,"I give it 5 stars because it is a wholesome movie in a very dirty world. The story line is as thin as gruel, but the actors are pleasant and the setting is beautiful. We think Eric looks like he's in his late 30's and Christine looks very young. I realize they are in fact much closer in age (I think he was 27 and she 21 at the time), but it's odd in today's context. Placing it in it's own timeline even had their ages been that different it wouldn't have been odd at all.

In short I liked it, no apologies needed. Certainly no Oscars, but then I love movies that don't try too hard. I want a break from reality (especially the morals of our day) not hyper-reality!",1366934400,,668,4.099236641221374

3846860,3,B0024IWKLS,It felt like two short stories were put together to make one longer movie. The story felt disjointed and that much was left out that would have made it much more intresting. I rented it because it was filmed near my home and used actors that I have watched in local productions. Fortunatly for the actors there are other parts that have been much better for them.,1332720000,4,363,4.432835820895522
3846861,3,B0024IWKLS,"Whisper Island is a mystery romance film.  The problem with the mystery is it's very hard to solve when supernatural things are involved that you don't know the rules of.  Some people must love that sort of thing.  Others of us don't.  To me, without rules, this is strange.  Don't get me wrong, the characters are interesting and fun, but the rest is, well, less so.",1321315200,6,367,4.5

3846886,4,B0024IWKLS,"It is a good family movie. Maybe a bit on the lame side; but that is better than being raunchy.  One thing that bothered me was they kept saying a man was given Gold to hide from the enemy, ""my father has a box of Gold hidden"" and so on throughout the movie.  But that is not what it was, and no one seemed surprised.
  The way they go back and forth from past to present makes it like watching 2 movies at the same time - that should keep the kids interest.
  The first 20 min or so is very slow, and I almost turned it off; but it did get better.",1447718400,,548,3.8053097345132745

3846910,1,B0024IWKLS,"It was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. It was so inconsistent. It did not make any sense. Why did he say at the end in the second to the last seen in the rowboat that they were going to see her father & mother when it was already established that her father was dead and that she never knew where her mother was? CRAZY! And what's even crazier is that they made this guy alive, then dead like a ghost or angel and then alive again to romance her & kiss her!!! What?! You can't physically kiss an angel; that doesn't make sense. And then he was like TWICE her age and she was a MINOR! Ummmmm That's MOLESTATION or STATUATORY RAPE, folks!!! It is ILLEGAL for a man to have sex with a minor; you can go to JAIL/PRISON for that!!! GROSS! He even called her 'young one' or something like that like 'child' when he was leaving her (admitting that she was WAY younger than him). Too creepy and confusing. And, why wouldn' t the old lady & all the other men have found the treasure EARLIER since they had the map and the sextant and the journal (everything they needed)! The plot does not add up. And why on EARTH would the old aunt in our CURRENT present age be dressed like someone in the 1800's?!!! That makes NO... SENSE.... AT... ALLL!!!!!!! It was so disturbing, creepy and incoherant. And what was the mother trying to do with those men?! PROSTITUTE herself to them to save their house that they didn' t even OWN?! That doesn't seem like much of a ""family-friendly"" movie!!! I can' t believe that they showed her doing that infront of 2 kids! Shocking. This was a TERRIBLE movie. So lame. So awful. I can't get those hours of my time back. What a waste of my time. The movie made no sense. The wig looked TERRIBLE too! I could TELL she (the mom) was wearing a wig. There are so many things wrong with this that I can't even remember all of them. Oh! another irritating factor: what was the whole dang point of the stupid whistle that was her father's????!!! They made a big deal out of it and then never used it for anything!! It never had a point to it!!! So AWFUL! This movie was stinkin' lame. And why was the old lady living w/ that lady and her daughter if they were not related?! That doesn't make sense. And if they WERE related, then wouldn't the lady/mother and daughter ALSO be eligible for the inheritance of the house as well?! This makes no stinkin' sense at ALL. Don't watch it.

Appropriate for school aged kids and teens as well as adults (there are 2 scenes that have a mild amount of violence, but nothing compared to what is on TV or in movies of today.)  The story of Aunt Christine is intriguing, and the ending where she and Eric are reunited is very touching and will make you shed a few tears.  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but it is really a great story.  I did not find it slow or boring at any point.  The hunt for the treasure was exciting and was fun to watch the mystery unfold.  The acting and cinematography were decent enough to enjoy the show and were as expected for a movie that is not blockbuster or very high budget.  I enjoyed the flashbacks between the early 1900's and present day, it was well done and weaved the story together nicely.  Overall, I highly recommend!",1501545600,,883,4.27710843373494
