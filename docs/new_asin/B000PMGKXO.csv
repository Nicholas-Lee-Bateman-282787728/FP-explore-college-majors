8192688,1,B000PMGKXO,"Reference the Dead Sea scrolls or the Nostic scrolls and you will see JC was about 5th 6 or so tall, full black hair and beard, born just our side Nazerth on Jan 6  1BC. His father was a stone mason, his mother was 12 when she conceived and 13 when she gave birth. He was a Jewish minister and scholar, his only wish was to get commercialism out of the Jewish church and return it to its fundamentals. The truth is in history .it should be note that he was minor figure in Jewish history. Jewish historians record that he did not die on the T shaped (cross ), but was exiled in to the desert and the Catholic Church has scrolls written by him after the crucifix, but won't admit they were written by him, but won't distroy them either. One must realize that the books in the Bible were the favorite stories told around camp fires and even the 4 books that make up the Holy Bible have many discrepancy, so which account is true. Nothing was put in writing until 60 years after he died. Want to know the historical man look to historical writings and accounts of his life. Even he said there is only one GOD and HE is the father and the creator, but still I respect him as a great man in our history.",1432512000,3,1198,4.163793103448276
8192689,5,B000PMGKXO,"This was a professional debate that addressed topics such as:
The Criteria of Historical Evidence about Jesus, When Were the Gospels Written?  Remarkable Evidence in the Dead Sea Scrolls, The Date of Christ's Nativity, Ministry &  Crucifixion, The Mysterious Shroud of Turin, Historical Evidence about Jesus, Ancient Jewish Messianic Expectations, The Genealogy of Jesus, Fulfilled Prophecies about Jesus as the Messiah just to name a few.

I found this to be a very meaty and stimulating DVD.

The program featured a few well known Bible scholars & Apologetic leaders.  Dr. Grant R. Jeffrey hosted this debate.  The speakers alone were enough for me to want to buy this DVD. Among the featured speakers are Dr. Josh McDowell author of ""Evidence that Demands A Verdict"", Dr. John Ankerberg the author of ""The Facts on False Views of Jesus"" with  Lee Strobel weighing in on the debate. Strobel is the author of a series of Apologetic books defending the faith. He used his  excellent journalist skills to write books such as:  The Case for Christ, The Case For the Creator (on Intelligent Design) and the Case For Faith.  This DVD also has additional commentaries by other great Christian authors, Dr. Erwin W. Lutzer & Kay Arthur. Need I say more on the reason you should buy this DVD?

 On the opposing side of the debate there is Dr. John Dominic Crossan, Dr. Daryl Schmidt and Clint Blauer.",1341100800,2,1393,4.8808510638297875
8192690,2,B000PMGKXO,"If you are really interested in this debate, a better choice would be the book ""Is The Jesus The God?"" by Douglas S.

8192691,3,B000PMGKXO,"""The Great Debate"" is a bit one-sided in that it makes only a surface pretense of impartiality in examining claims of Christ's divinity.  It aims to take on scientific advocates on their home field terrain in proving the accuracy of the gospels and the truth of Jesus being the son of God and the subject of literal resurrection.

Much of the latter focuses on issues relating to the Shroud of Turin. I confess and disclose that I come to view this ""debate"" as a Christian and at least applaud the movie makers for attempting to assemble scientific evidence to prove their points and support their beliefs.

Ultimately, though, even if the evidence is in counterpoise or weighted more heavily on the side of the skeptics, the belief in the matters at the movie's heart will likely boil down to a matter of faith.  This is not a criticism., only a suggestion that scientific standards are but one - and by no means the sole - arbiter of what is real, what is true or what is (or was) possible.",1203984000,10,992,4.5251396648044695

DVD VIDEO VERSION OF JESUS DEBATE IS BETTER THAN BOOK ... also get the DVD from QUESTAR (which was created after this Video)

JESUS AND THE SHROUD OF TURIN DVD has more SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR THE SHROUD

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-the-Shroud-of-Turin/dp/B0000CBXYP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus & the Shroud of Turin</a>

I have this book ""JESUS DEBATE"", as well as others from Jeffrey and similar writers. This is one of two books that I introduce to people who really want to know the TRUTH about Jesus, God ... and How to get to Heaven (born-again John 3:3) But, I PREFER THE VIDEO VERSION of this book.

The undecided, atheists, and ""have to be politically correct"" cannot answer the MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE --- beginning of LIFE from nothing, the fulfilled BIBLE PROPHECIES written hundreds of years earlier (Jesus as Messiah, Israel reborn in 1948, etc), God's unique watermark of BIBLE CODES discovered by Jewish mathematicians (and published with a challenge to disprove it), as well as the SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE of the Resurrection ""SHROUD of Turin""

Jeffrey's ""SIGNATURE OF GOD"" (book and video) provides an overview of most of this in a single volume - the point being that the writing of the Bible was in effect ""dictated"" or controlled by God to further reveal Himself and His Message to humanity, culminating in Resurrection of Jesus (as God) and the New Testament. The other resource that I loan out to people is this review ""Jesus Debate"" both the book and THE VIDEO (from grantjeffrey website).

The Jesus Debate VIDEO HAS GREATER IMPACT than the book as it is EASIER TO FOLLOW the logical progression from one question to the next. Both the book and video are meant to be a wide ranging overview of material (much the same as ""Signature of God""). The first half of the video covers the necessary background of: integrity and historical accuracy of the Gospels, Jesus as God, Reality versus Myth (including the Resurrection), etc This series of debate interviews gives equal time on a question by question basis between the ""politically-correct"" liberals on one side (Jesus Seminar) and the Christians (born-again) on the other.

The SECOND HALF OF THE VIDEO details the different aspects of the ""STURP"" SCIENTISTS and their EVIDENCE for the authenticity of the burial cloth of Jesus at the time of His Resurrection; otherwise, known as the ""The Shroud of Turin"" (named for the town & church which kept it for safekeeping over the last few hundred years).

The SCIENTIFIC TESTS cover, for example, the THREE DIMENSIONAL (PHOTOGRAPHIC NEGATIVE) life-size IMAGE that was formed through space (onto a two dimensional object draped over it - the Shroud), the FOREIGN POLLEN GRAINS from Israel and Odessa (where it traveled from Israel to France/Italy), the ISRAELI FLOWERS imaged around the head (used in the burial preparation) --- later becoming the inspiration for the ""halo"" in paintings, the numerous DETAILS OF THE FACE (which would be accepted in a modern court of law as well as becoming another model for later paintings), the image of the dated ""PONTIUS PILATE"" COIN also burned into the cloth, the MEDICAL FORENSIC EVIDENCE of a crucifixion, the HUMAN BLOOD contained within the Shroud, ...

... as well as the LAB ANALYSIS of the CAUSE OF THE IMAGE which has been determined to be produced by a BURST OF RADIATION (referred to as a ""neutron flux""). --- And the only argument against the Shroud is a CONSPIRACY THEORY that it's all just a ""FORGERY"". But, the last time I checked, the TIME FRAME for this forgery (anywhere from the 1300s to 1500s AD) there were very few radiation machines sitting around. As a matter of fact, the TECHNOLOGY needed to create this particular Shroud image STILL DOESN'T EXIST TODAY. (Maybe the conspiracy should be updated and moved into the FUTURE, using a ""Time machine"" ??? --- ALSO not yet invented).

Public Broadcasting PBS ALSO REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION in their TV PROGRAM ""Secrets of the Dead"". This Shroud IMAGE CAN'T BE RECREATED IN THE SCIENCE LAB. The PBS video goes through several recreations (which fail), while Jeffrey's video goes into a lot of detail of all the scientific evidence for its authenticity.

Compared to the HUNDREDS OF TESTS that the Shroud DID PASS, the ONLY SINGLE TEST that it did NOT pass was the infamous CARBON 14-dating. This only ""date test"" (Carbon-14) would be disproven by other dating methods, the flawed selection of material, contamination of material, and the lack of integrity in its oversight.

Instead of allowing the STURP team of scientists CONTROL OVER THE CARBON-14 TEST (and its results), it was taken over by Edward Hall and Harry Gove (who managed the laboratories where the test was made). Gove also made sure that the Carbon-14 RESULT would be a failure for the Shroud supporters. This ACCUSATION is detailed by the ATTORNEY/author Mark Antonacci (in chapters eight and nine) of his book ""Resurrection of the Shroud""

This DATING TEST WAS RAN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO using 1988 technology and experience. Christians and many scientists (including those from the original STURP team) HAVE ASKED FOR A RE-RUN OF THIS AND OTHER DATING TESTS using TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY --- under controlled conditions, using multiple, relatively uncontaminated (location-wise) samples, with OTHER CORELLATED TESTS for various environmental contaminants.

This single mishandled Carbon-14 test, prematurely cut short all of the other tests that were planned, but years later in 2002 another examination of the Shroud, brought back it's Jesus date as ""AUTHENTIC"". Most of the books published on the Shroud were written in 1999 or 2000, so they have not been updated with THIS NEW EVIDENCE.

The Vatican allowed for RESTORATION WORK IN 2002 OF THE SHROUD (removing some of the patches that were accelerating the oxidation of the adjacent original) under the direct supervision of the WORLD'S LEADING TEXTILE EXPERT HISTORIAN Mechthild Flury-Lemberg. She also has extensive expertise with other ancient cloths from Israel 2000 years ago, which lead to discoveries (during this restoration) that ACTUALLY DATE THE SHROUD TO THE FIRST CENTURY TIME OF JESUS CHRIST - FULLY REFUTING THE FLAWED CARBON-14 DATE. (This is detailed in the PUBLIC PBS VIDEO)

*** And for those having a bias ... members of the ATHEIST RELIGION ...""the evolution origin of first Life from DEAD matter as proven scientific fact"")
(1) in your dreams ...
(2) many of whom NEVER READ any of these books and videos, but still give them one star (don't want to spend the money?)
(3) Try to think about this without a knee-jerk reaction:

According to the Shroud STURP SCIENTISTS, the Resurrection Shroud CANNOT be recreated in a science lab ... much less the fact that it's the ONLY ONE IN EXISTENCE for the LAST TWO THOUSAND YEARS. Why aren't other shrouds popping up all over the place? ... Just even one or two???

If it's not the ""PROOF"" OF JESUS RESURRECTION, (prophecy, archeology, history aside) then WHY aren't the thousands of atheist SCIENTISTS at LEAST coming up with a decent KNOCK-OFF REPRODUCTION in your labs??? Or are your scientists TOO BUSY trying to recreate LIFE (from inanimate, lifeless material) to PROVE GOD doesn't exist??? And unfortunately, for many of you, there will NEVER be enough evidence to convince you otherwise ... ""waiting till Hell freezes over"" isn't an option available for anyone.

The ""GOOD NEWS"" ... YOU CAN become an EX-atheist. (LIKE THE former atheist WRITERS Lee Strobel and Ralph Muncaster, above). Actually give yourself a few months to look at the other side of the issue from the Christian books, videos and sites listed above. If the Christians are wrong then you've gone the extra mile for that assurance and IF they're actually right after all (and you're still here) then YOU CAN have the True ASSURANCE at the moment of your Death that Jesus is in fact a proven, personal and the ONLY WAY to Heaven. In the meantime, think of these books and videos as a good excuse for coffee and doughnuts. What have you got to lose? --- ETERNITY?",1194048000,8,8285,5.046086320409656
8192693,2,B000PMGKXO,"This is not a debate.  Debates have 2 sides.  This is a wholly Christian and one sided reasoning for the case of Christ.

If you want a debate on whether or not Christ was who the Bible says he is, this is not the place to find it.

The ""Host"" has studdied for the case of Christ for 35 years on the pro-Christian side.

The only skeptics in this movie are shaky and almost feeble old critics that are easily dismissed and given very little time to make a point.

This movie does make an interesting case for the historical backing of the events in the Bible.  It shows that the events were possible if not statistically probable.  But once again, it does not delve into the debate as to whether or not Christ's word is the word of God or merely fantastical stories meant to strengthen the faith of those who believe in him.",1181865600,12,824,4.2709677419354835
