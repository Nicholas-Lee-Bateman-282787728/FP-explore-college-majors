8525720,5,B0085X3240,"Released as ""Ddongpari"" in Korea, this is a film about violence - and the destruction it wreaks. But it is also so much more; it leads with Sang-Hoon who is a small time loan shark enforcer. He beats people who owe money and he beats the guys up who he works with and he seems to like beating up everyone.

Then one day he meets a high school girl who challenges him on his bad behaviour. Despite his continual anti- social behaviour and propensity for profanity they start a friendship.

What we get is the story of all concerned told in flashback and slow reveals. It is about the cyclical nature of violence and how it gets passed on and taught to the next generation. The film features many scenes of violence and so much swearing and insults that at times it is hard to see the messages behind the macho centric mask of cruelty.

What this also is though is a truly excellent piece of cinema; the actors are all excellent - even the little children, and the directing, cinematography and production are only overshadowed by the excellent writing. This is a film that reminds me of why I fell in love with Korean cinema in the first place and is one I can highly recommend.",1433548800,2,1177,4.414746543778802

8525722,2,B0085X3240,Was a bit disappointed.. Korean movies usually hit the mark but this one didn't! It was a good story but I really don't buy the fact that someone as smart as this dude couldn't see it coming....,1351728000,,194,4.27027027027027
8525723,5,B0085X3240,"Breathless is a drama film from South Korea. It tells the story of Sang-hoon and Yeon-hee; both suffer from and try to cope with their violent pasts. The relationship they develop was a ""big brother/little sister"" type of relationship, we can see they really care for each other and it could've gone deeper. More importantly, this film tells the story and sends the message of the never-ending circle of violence. Although some violence is done of screen, most of the domestic violence is vivid and brutal. The scenes that really got me were the scenes where Sang-hoon beats on his father and the outcome of those beatings. Some may cringe or look away especially if it hits home, and the authenticity is a big plus in this film. The feelings this film evokes are refreshing and daring. Overall, the story is deep, the character are great, the acting is brilliant (Yang Ik-june as Sang-hoon gives an amazing performance) and it has one breathtaking ending. This is a must watch movie, and I highly recommend it.

As for the DVD, the movie plays immediately with English subtitles. You can go to the menu but you'll be disappointed; there are no special features and there is no set-up menu. The main menu only has Play All, Resume, and Chapter Select. While the movie is amazing, the DVD is actually a little lackluster. It gets the job done, though, as I was able to watch the DVD without any problems/glitches.

Breathless has strong violence and blood, and strong language. There is no sex or nudity in this film.",1345593600,6,1516,4.716981132075472
