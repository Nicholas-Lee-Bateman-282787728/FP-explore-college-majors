998794,5,6305252599,"Having Nick Meyer at the helm once again, proves that the original chemistry among the Star Trek family could once again be recaptured.  Giving a ""darker"" image to the movie reflects the plot of what is  a teriffic way to say good-bye to the magnificent seven who have had such a  great impact on our lives.  With the stage being set with the erie opening  score, to the final (and quite literal) sign off by the cast, Star Trek VI,  The Undiscovered Country once again gives us what true Star Trek fans have  come to expect.  Stellar performances by Christopher Plummer and William  Shatner lead to lessons in racial bigotry, and tolerance to change.  Captivated by a proverbial ""who done it?"", the audience is kept  guessing throughout the movie.  That along with some spectacualr battle  sequences once again gives us Trek at it's best demonstrating the awesome  power of the Starship Enterprise, with it's equally awesome crew at her  helm. Star Trek VI is entertaining as well as inspirational, fitting Gene  Roddenberry's original pattern to the series he created.  Star Trek VI is a  winner for sure.",917740800,,1107,4.828877005347594
998795,2,6305252599,"With Paramount jumping on the DVD bandwagon, it's good to see some of our favorite Star Trek films now available on DVD. With the initial release of First Contact, featuring a 16x9 enhanced widescreen presentation, I figured  Paramount was heading in the right direction. Generations was released soon  after, but lacked the 16x9 enhancement - which would have been the only  reason why I would have purchased that movie. The original Laser was one of  the first Dolby Digital laserdiscs, and I didn't see the cost justification.  However, Star Trek VI was *the* first Dolby Digital film, period. Dolby  Labs considered it an experiment at the time. I knew the DVD would be 5.1  enhanced, so I preordered this movie.
It was bad. While the sound was  great, the widescreen was not even at the original ratio (around a 2.1:1,  the laserdisc had the same problem) And they had the nerve to put the  subtitles in the lower black bar, which were cut off on my 16x9 TV. It  looked like a duplicate of the laserdisc, and they thought they could just  compensate by pushing the film up higher, thus eliminating the top black  bar in widescreen mode. Most of these subtitles below were cut off.
While  I give the 2 stars for the Dolby Digital sound, I give it no stars for  grainy video and poor widescreen implementation. If you have the original  laserdisc, and are satisfied with the sound quality, don't bother with the  DVD.",917481600,4,1420,4.684210526315789
998796,4,6305252599,The movie suffers a bit from a tight budget (ckeck out Valaris sliding down a ladder and hitting a bulkhead.  The whole wall shakes.  But all that aside this is the one of the strongest Trek films only bettered by II and  First Contact.  The principles of Star Trek are closely adhered to and the  Cast Autograph sign off at the end of the movie was a GREAT way to end the  last trek movie to have the complete old-series cast.

It had the extra scenes as promised but, unfortunately, the interrogation scene of Valaris was not as described.  One of the reviewers claimed it was the theatrical release which showed the flashbacks and close ups of Kirk and McCoy but it did not.  It was otherwise intact as promised.

998970,4,6305252599,"Well, here it is, the last voyage of the Enterprise under Captain Kirk's command. And once again, he and his intrepid crew save ""civilization as we know it."" Only difference is, this time they are quite self-aware. They are making history. I am noticing an amazing number of parallels of US v. USSR and Federation v. Klingon Empire. Just coincidence, I'm sure.

Due to a serious accident on the Klingon's weapons-making planet, the Klingon Empire is as weak as it's ever been. The choice then, is between killing them off and making a peace treaty. Spock (due to his father, the Vulcan Ambassador) is firmly on the side of the peace conference. Kirk has grave doubts, but it nonetheless assigned to bring the Klingon envoy to the peace conference.

But of course, something went wrong. There is a conspiracy to undermine the conference. Who could be so low? The envoy's ship is attacked, the envoy killed, and the evidence points to the torpedoes having come from the Enterprise. Of course, Kirk did not order them fired, but they certainly did look like they had been fired from the Enterprise, although Scotty insists that all his torpedoes are accounted for. So, in the interests of saving his ship, Kirk surrenders, and McCoy goes with him.

McCoy attempts to save the life of the envoy, but fails. The envoy's daughter takes her father's place. The Klingons put Kirk and McCoy on trial, and find them guilty. In the interests of peace, however, their sentences are commuted from death to life at hard labor on a frozen planet.

If I told you any more, it would spoil the surprises which this movie manages to provide in very effective fashion. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to those who enjoyed the second and third TV series that the peace conference is saved by the crew of the Enterprise.",1337126400,,1799,4.701587301587302
998971,5,6305252599,"this is a very difficult dvd to find and buy, so when i found what i thought i couldn't, i jumped, bought and viewed. and i might add, was not disapointed.  the delivery of the item was solid and 'on the ball'. i didn't expect it to be dressed in an original sleeve so i wasn't suprised when it arived in a plain but durable wrapper. bottom line is that it is a pleasure to buy from a reliable vendor who sends what it says and says what it will send. now, the movie?  of course it is good;  probably the best of the bunch. to see the original players/actors age with grace with a knock-out story-line. the physical science applied is what will probably be faced when humans reach that final frontier with little left to someone's imagination .  when i taught physics in high school ages ago, i used this movie as a go-to for not only entertainment but  more for 'this is a real possibility'. like why would i buy an item of so-so quality and enjoyment?",1254441600,,953,4.272222222222222
998972,5,6305252599,"I am an avid Star Trek fan; TNG being my favorite of the series.  Nevertheless, I think Undiscovered Country is the best of the Star Trek Movies.  The casting was perfect.  Kim Cattral as a Vulcan was a risky but great move, she pulls it off.  Christopher Plummer lends weight to the General Chang role. If you have Shakespear quotes in a movie, you had better cast someone who can do it well and Plummer does.  The humor and commraderie that you expect from the Star Trek crew is there along with political intrigue that any non sci-fi fan might enjoy too!  This is a must see!",1158364800,4,578,4.355140186915888
998973,5,6305252599,"""The Undiscovered Country"" was the sixth of the Star Trek movies and hit the movie screens in 1991. Like ""The Wrath of Khan"", this film was directed by Nicholas Meyer, and tells the story of the last mission undertaken by Captain Kirk and his crew.

The film opens in 2293, with the USS Excelsior returning home from a three-year mission charting gaseous anomalies in beta quadrant. Under the command of Captain Sulu, it monitors a devastating explosion on the Klingon moon, Praxis - one that literally tears the moon apart. As well as losing a key energy production facility, the Klingons are left with a more pressing problem : within fifty years, the Klingon homeworld would be uninhabitable due to the resulting damage to its atmosphere.

Several months later, Kirk and most of his senior staff are mysteriously called to a meeting with Starfleet's top brass. Three months away from retirement, they're a little confused as to why they have been summoned - and why Spock is, apparently, missing. The mystery is presently cleared up : they are briefed on what happened on Praxis and informed that, as a result, peace talks have opened between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. Further details are then provided by the Federation's Special Envoy : Spock. Compounding Kirk's surprise at Spock's role in proceedings is his dismay that Spock's plans for the Enterprise and her crew. Spock has volunteered them, without their knowledge, to escort Gorkon (the Klingon Chancellor) to Earth for a peace conference. Obviously Kirk - having spent his career fighting Klingons and still smarting from his son's death at Klingon hands - does not approve. He is not alone in expressing his concerns - several Admirals, including Cartwright, believe it very dangerous to even consider allowing Klingons free access to Federation space. All objections, however, are brushed aside by the Commander-in-Chief and Spock's plan is given the green light. Unfortunately, mixing Kirk and Klingons can only lead to trouble - especially when both parties are threatened with peace. (Just so long as nobody lets them near the Romulan Ale....D'OH !!).

There are several well-known guest stars in the movie : Michael Dorn (Worf from TNG and DS9) appears as a Klingon Defence Attorney, while Iman appears as a shape-shifting convict. Kim Cattrall also appears playing Lt. Valeris, a new Enterprise Bridge Officer. She was sponsored through the Academy by Spock and was the first Vulcan to graduate top of her class. General Chang, one of Gorkon's aides, is a great character - probably the most entertaining in the movie. He seems to enjoy testing Kirk - someone he shares a few traits with. Both are tough old warriors who are suspicious of the peace initiative. Overall this in a hugely entertaining movie - there's plenty of action, humor and opportunities for characters to bend the rules. For me, this beats ""The Wrath of Khan"" as the best of the Trek movie featuring the crew of the original series.",1101859200,,2985,4.98995983935743
998974,3,6305252599,"I was waiting for months for this special edition
DVD to come out....The first thing I noticed was it was missing the Booklet with the chapter stops, etc...I thought for sure that it was accidently omitted in my copy.  I was set to return it to the store that I had purchased it from, but they were sold out.  But it looks like the folks at Paramount did not include one!  I'm very surprised that they didn't even print a one page card with the chapter stops.  The other thing I noticed was on the second disc, the Scene printed was the Enterprise B from ST Generations, oddly enough printed upside down!  I guess it goes to show that the folks at Paramount don't care much about their cashcow.  The movie itself looks great, I remember watching it several times in the Theatre and many times on VHS.  I never saw the original DVD release, so I'm not sure how it compares.  I was a little disappointed in watching the effects on dvd, as the Enterprise looks a little Cheezy today.  It never looks huge, or as dramatically lit, as in STAR TREK I & II.  Speaking of which, I was hoping that there would be a featurette on the Special Effects, but there wasn't.  I read that they had a shoestring budget on this film, and it would have been interesting to hear the folks at ILM talk about their work on this final Classic cast picture.
The final battle sequence was also a little longer in FX originally, & it would have been nice to see some of those effects shots before they were edited.  But sadly, it seems that no one asked ILM, or Bill George to contribute to this DVD.
Overall, a pretty good entry for the STAR Trek cannon, weakened by some of the things you'd expect in a Major film studio's DVD; insert booklet, and maybe a more comprehensive special features.
The motion on the menu's were weak and derivative compared to some of the other releases.  My favorite extras were the DeForest Kelly Tribute, & the Penny's box.",1075852800,4,1929,4.4
998975,5,6305252599,"Fans are torn as to whether this or Wrath of khan is thebest Star Trek movie.  I side myself with the former, largely because I am a political junkie, and enjoy the Cold War elements.  This film was made in 1991, a scant two years after the end of the Cold War.  Old enemies (the Federation and the Klingons) have to become uneasy allies.  Such alliances are not built overnight.  How can two peoles, who've hated each othert for so long, finally call a truce?
Theanswrr is ceratinly not clear. Even our heroes have a hard time with this ""brave new world.""  Other Klingons, who don't want to see peace, take a harder line and do everything they can to destroy the reconcilliation process. I won't rehash the story here (you've seen the thing, I know), but the message is worth reiterating--there is hope for us al, even old enemies, to resolve differences.
This film was the send off for the original crew, and its a wonderful note to go out on. I particularly enjoyed Deforest Kelley's role. I don't think he got nearly enough credit for making Star Trek as enjoyable as it was with his dry sense of humor.
Star trek has always done political allegory.  It has many times been havy handed and preachy, but this time the politics was deat in a solid, respectable, and entertaining manner. Christopher Plummer doesn't get much attention, but his General Chang is a classic Star trek villian.
This is one of the grest Trek movies, and a fantatic way to pass the baton to the Next Generation crew. Watch for Worf's grandpappy as a Klingon defense attorney in the trial scene as a way of brdging the gap between the two crews.",1075507200,,1622,4.534246575342466
998976,5,6305252599,"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is, by far, the best of the Trek films. The movie was the final movie featuring the entire cast of the original Star Trek series. It was directed by Nicholas Meyer (the director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan) and the music was composed by Cliff Eidelman, who by the way did a sensational score.
Note: Plot summary ahead, including vague look into ending, don't read if you haven't seen the movie.
The basic plot of the movie is that Sulu, now the captain of the Excelsior, monitors an explosion on the Klingon moon, Praxis, the results of which mean that the o-zone layer on the Klingon homeworld will be completely gone within 50 years. Because of this, the Klingons want peace with the Federation. The Enterprise-A, against Kirk's will,  has been ordered to escort the Klingon chancellor, Gorkon, to Earth for negotiations. En-route, 2 Starfleet officers beam aboard the chancellor's ship and brutally murder several Klingon officers, including the chancellor. Kirk and McCoy beam over to help, but, after the chancellor dies, they are placed under arrest, tried, and sentenced to life imprisonment on the mining asteroid, Rura Penthe. Spock assumes command of the Enterprise-A and refuses to return to Earth until he finds out what really happened. Eventually, he frees Kirk and McCoy and they uncover a conspiracy involving the Klingons, the Romulans, and the Federation, which includes, surprisingly, a treacherous Vulcan. And, of course, Enterprise-A and the Excelsior save the day. After bidding Sulu and crew a fond farewell, Captain Kirk recieves orders to return to Earth and be decomissioned. Spock then says, ""If I were human, I believe my response to that would be, 'Go to Hell!' . If I were human."" The bridge crew smiles and Kirk has Checkov set a course for the ""Second star to the right and straight on till morning!"" After that, the captain, in a very setimental, emotional scene of the Enterpise-A flying towards the star,  makes his final captain's log entry. His last words, ""...boldly going where no man, where no one, has gone before."" The ship then disappears into the star and the screen shows the cast signing there names on it.",1073088000,,2198,4.905913978494624
999076,4,6305252599,"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, released in 1991 a few months after the Silver Anniversary of the original television series and the death of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, is a suspenseful and adventure-packed ""final voyage"" for Capt. James T. Kirk and the Starship Enterprise.
Coming on the heels of the less-than-stellar Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and the resignation of Harve Bennett as producer of the feature films, Paramount turned to actor/producer Leonard Nimoy and director/screenwriter Nicholas Meyer (Time After Time, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan) to save the foundering franchise and give fans something worthy of a 25th-anniversary celebration.  After looking at various options, they decided on a Star Trek version of the end of the Cold War.
The Undiscovered Country (the title is a Shakespearean reference to death and was Meyer's first choice for the title of Star Trek II) capitalizes on the similarities of the U.S.-Soviet standoff to the long-standing not-quite-war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.  Fittingly, the film begins with a bang when, in a Chernobyl-like accident, the Klingon's main energy production source on the moon of Praxis explodes.
The explosion sends both literal and political shock waves across the galaxy.  The physical subspace wave buffets the USS Excelsior, now commanded by former Enterprise helmsman Hikaru Sulu (George Takei).  Capt. Sulu, in the tradition of good Starfleet captains, offers assistance but is rebuffed by the Klingon High Command.
Nevertheless, three months later, Sulu's former shipmates, including Capt. Kirk (William Shatner), Dr. Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy (the late DeForest Kelley), Capt. Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Cmdrs. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) and Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) are summoned to a top secret level meeting.  ""The Klingon Empire,"" they are told by Starfleet's commanding admiral, ""has less than 50 years to live.""  Praxis' explosion has depleted the ozone layer of the Klingons' homeworld and polluted the atmosphere.  Heavy expenditures on weapons and bases has weakened the Klingon economy and the cleanup is beyond their means.  A special envoy has been appointed by the Federation to begin negotiations with Chancellor Gorkon, leader of the Klingon High Council.  To the shock of Kirk and his officers, that envoy is Enterprise first officer Spock (Leonard Nimoy).
And when Kirk is assigned to escort Gorkon's ship into Federation space for a summit on Earth with the Federation president (That 70's Show's Kurtwood Smith), he's shocked and angry.  Not only are the senior officers due to retire in a few months, but Kirk is still bitter about his son's death at the hands of the Klingons several years before.  But the good captain has been issued his orders, and like it or not, he will do his duty.
Little does he know that a massive conspiracy to undermine the peace negotiations is underway, planned by those in the Federation and the Klingon Empire who have a lot to lose if peace breaks out.  And soon, Kirk and the Enterprise crew are caught in a web of deceit and intrigue that will place their lives in jeopardy....and shatter the last best hope for galactic peace.
The film features a fine performance by Sex in the City's sultry Kim Catrall as Lt. Valeris, Spock's full-Vulcan protege with a hidden agenda of her own, as well as a wonderfully over-the-top appearance by Christopher Plummer as a dastardly, Shakespeare-quoting Klingon general.  The Undiscovered Country also acknowledges the legitimacy of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and with an appearance by ST-TNG actor Michael Dorn as Col. Worf (the grandfather, one surmises, of the Enterprise-D's Lt. Worf, Dorn's ""regular"" role), the two generations are bridged on the silver screen.  (""Unification, Parts I and II,"" guest starring Leonard Nimoy, had aired a few weeks before the film's premiere and included a few subtle references to its storyline.)
Star Trek VI's home video, laserdisc and first DVD releases contain the longer edited-for-home-viewing version which includes two deleted scenes featuring Rene Auberjonois (who would later be cast as Odo in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) as Col. West.  Paramount has released a barebones DVD since 1998, but a 2-disc Collector's Edition is forthcoming.",1068681600,50,4306,5.256559766763848
999077,4,6305252599,"I had a chance to watch this film in the Imax theatre in San Antonio in january 1992 and I was blown away with the inmensity. Nicolas Myer brought back true Star Trek dimensions eventhough I would've like a seen of the Enterprise orbiting the gulag. It was refreshing after the dissapiontment of III, IV and V. The seriousness of the movie took me back to Star Trek II, the acting is solid, the visuals are what you should expect from the explosion of Praxis to the battle. The Klingnons are great and Plummer's sutile characterization is phenomenal. The score gives an incredible atmosphere and to me it is second best after Horner's in Star Trek II. And, of course, the finale to a series is... better than what you'd expect.",1062633600,,727,4.557251908396947
999078,5,6305252599,"This is the last time the original crew comes together in its entirety (though Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov return in the extremely mediocre Star Trek Generations) and is the best movie of the original 6 (it also beats all the TNG movies as well). The plot is interesting and the more than a decade old special effects still look great. This movie starts the friendship between the klingons and the federation that was carried on in Star trek the Next Generation. The acting is excelent and the Enterprise riding off into the sunset at the end is priceless. This is a must see for the trekkie and non-trekkie alike",1061942400,,610,4.605504587155964
999079,5,6305252599,"The final Star Trek film to feature the original cast is an enormous improvement after the awful fifth film, and might just be the best in the series. Much of it is probably thanks to the return of director Nicholas Meyer, who is responsible also for the classic Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (while film III through V were directed by cast members). Meyer's very professional directing shows in every scene on ST-VI, and the old cast - William Shatner (Kirk), Leonard Nimoy (Spock), DeForest Kelly (McCoy), James Doohan (Scotty) and the rest - give here what is without doubt their finest performance. Mind - Shatner and Nimoy are by now 60 years old, while Kelly and Doohan are well into their 70s. But there isn't a trace of the pathetic silliness that characterized the fifth movie; Meyer knows what to do with these aging actors that wouldn't make them look like idiots. What we see in Star Trek VI is a much more mature approach, and the crew members have to face, more than an outside enemy, their own aging, and their fear of change. That fear is a key element here, and it's an issue that is well handled and is always relevant.
While the old cast members are doing splendidly here, the movie introduces some fantastic new characters. First and foremost, the experienced Shakespearean actor Christopher Plummer makes a fascinating villain in the conservative and suspicious Klingon General Chang, endlessly throwing out Shakespeare quotes on every turn. (`You haven't truly enjoyed Shakespeare until you've read it in the original Klingon') Also, Kim Cattrall, who achieved much success lately in the acclaimed `Sex And The City'), plays the Vulcan Lt. Valeris and gives a great performance. Finally, David Warner gives a brief but memorable performance as the visionary Chancellor Gorkon. The real stars here, though, are Shatner and Kelly, whose attempt to save the Chancellor's life, as well as their trial for assassination before a Klingon court (CAMEO: Michael Dorn, who plays Worf in the Next Generation, plays Kirk and McCoy's attorney here - Colonel Worf. An ancestor, probably) make for some of the best scenes ever seen on Star Trek. The directing and camera work are splendid, and the script has just the right amount of self humor, which was dreadfully lacking from the fifth movie (e.g.: Spock: `If I were human I believe my response would be ""go to hell."" ...If I were human.' All in all, a remarkable sign off for the original crew of the Enterprise and one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.",1060387200,,2523,4.815668202764977
999080,2,6305252599,"I looked forward to this film before it came out in theatres since Star Trek V was so horrible, alas this effort is only so-so. The character interactions were good, I liked that part. What I didn't like was the silly whodunnit storyline that was too predictable anyway. It had so many holes.  For instance on the prison planet, why not just shoot Spock and McCoy right away?  Why set up this elaborate scheme with Iman's character and then surround them? I mean, what if they managed to escape?  Which they did by the way.
Also, why didn't the bioscanner on the transporter pick up the klingon blood that the two shooters had on their boots when they reenergized?  How did they manage to beam out without the bridge knowing about it?  These were some of the little things to be sure, but they really add up in this movie.

Star Trek VI finds the Federation attempting a peace treaty with the Klingons, but soon Captain Kirk finds himself framed for the murder of the Klingon's chancelor.  This is the kind of classic Trek thats fans yearned for, and Meyer uses the same formula he had with Star Trek II mixing intelligent storytelling with a Shakespearian space opera, all of which makes this installment light years beyond the dismal Final Frontier.  Excellent casting elevates the film as well, including a scene chewing Christopher Plummer as the Klingon Chang, David Warner as Chancelor Gorkon, a pre-Sex in the City Kim Catrall, and a cameo by Christian Slater as an officer on the USS Excelsior.

While I would certainly reccomend renting this DVD to experience the movie itself in the widescreen format with the improved picture and sound quality, I would like to warn you not to waste the money buying it.

The studio has put out the Director's Edition DVD sets for the first three Star Trek movies, with the fourth due out in early March. These are double disc sets, with numerous tracks of audio commentary, as well as written commentary(bottom of tv screen) optional French dubbing and/or subtitles (Why no Spanish, I don't know) as well as a load of interesting special features on the other disc. The only problem is that they were released months apart from one another. Bearing that in mind, the director's edition of this won't likely be out until the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Nontheless, it will make the one available here obselete.

Paramount, however, wanted a conventional film to be made in time for Star Trek's 25th anniversary.  Harve Bennett originally planned on participating, but declined later due to this change (and also because of his drinking problems, he later said).  In that event, Nimoy was selected as executive producer and was allowed to write and/or direct.  Obviously, he didn't want to direct, but he wrote out a story alongside screenwriters Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal.  His next choice could not have been better: Nicholas Meyer, who would direct and co-write alongside novelist Denny Martin Flinn.
The film is very dark in comparison to the previous features and even Kirk and Spock have a strained relationship due to the coming peace conference and the renegade vulcan played by Kim Cattrall.  The film flows well and the story is very Shakespearian (General Chang, played by Christopher Plummer, often quotes Shakespeare and other famous words).
While Nemesis failed to be a great final film for the TNG cast (although it may or may not be), this film took the original cast out in style.  A humanly enthralling tale with betrayal and suspense (and Sulu FINALLY becoming a captain!), this should please all Trek fans.
Cliff Eidelman produced the score here and I believe it to be quite good.  Many fans were put off by this because it doesn't have a dominant theme (although it HAS a theme); it's mostly a dark, operatic score with overtures ranging throughout.  I personally enjoyed it.  It ranks up there with most of the other scores.
And finally, William Shatner actually acts well here.  The ending is so well done (no spoilers), too.  The visual effects are very impressive.  Overall, a grand adventure in the best Trek tradition.  It's a shame Roddenberry hated it at the preview and then died three days later.  This is definitely one of the Trekkiest and is, sad to say, the last of the great Treks.  Only ""First Contact"" comes close to surpassing any of the original Trek films (except TMP and V, of course, which are terrible), which is a shame.",1048809600,,2214,4.8302387267904505

This movie pits Kirk and crew against a Shakespeare quoting pirate of a Klingon, hell bent on stopping the peace process between the United Federation of Planets and the now crippled, Klingon Empire.  The movie has some pretty intense action, and the space battles are pretty good.  There is a Klingon Bird of Prey that can, believe it or not, fire when cloaked.  This causes some pretty bad problems for the valiant crew of the Enterprise.
The character interaction is key in the progression of this film.  You can feel that this is the last time all of these characters will be together, and in that, you know this is something very profound.  This film marks the end of an era, and a new generation of heroes has to take the helm of the Enterprise.

It brings you back with a little more action, and a little less blah. This time around, the crew of the Enterprise find themselves on their last mission.
While Captain Sulu is helming the USS Excelsior, Kirk and crew find themselves on a mission with the Klingons after their moon Praxis explodes and puts serious repercussions on the Klingon Empire. While Kirk is still agitated by the death of his son David at the hands of the Klingons, he reluctantly takes up the mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a meeting on Earth. However, the Enterprise apparently fires upon the Chancellor's battle cruiser and heads begin to spin. A conspiracy is unfolding that involves General Chang, Lt. Valeris, and Admiral Cartwright and the Romulan ambassador, and when Kirk and McCoy are framed for the Chancellor's death, it's up to Spock and the rest of the crew to help rescue them and free them of responsibility for the death of Chancellor Gorkon. In the end, as usual, the Federation triumphs and peace is restored between the Klingon Empire and the Federation.
There are some terrific actions sequences, particularly the battle involving the new prototype Bird of Prey and the Enterprise (and later, the Excelsior). It's one of the best to come around in a long time. Also, some very good acting from the likes of David Warner (Gorkon), Christopher Plummer (Chang), and even an appearance by the exotic Iman!

999227,5,6305252599,"Trek movies have always been easy to figure out -- odd numbers bad, even number good.  This just happens to be the best.
Star Trek (original series) was often at its best when it told stories of contemporary interest thinly veiled as tales of science fiction.  This movie follows that line.  In our own world the Soviet Union was collapsing.  In the Trek universe, the Klingon Empire is about to die.  The problem in both is how to extend an olive branch to your traditional enemies.
Kirk is no prepared to let down his guard.  Neither are several other members of Star Fleet (not to mention their counterparts in the Klingon Empire).  When the Klingon amabassador is assassinated war looms.  The only way to avert it is to let Kirk and McCoy be tried by the Klingons for crimes they did not commit.  After that the real fun begins.
This film has some great acting in it.  Sulu gets to come into his own (as we always knew he could).  Watch for small roles by Christian Slater, Michael Dorn, and several others.  Christopher Plummer, however, really steals the show as the Shakespeare-quoting militarist Klingon commander.  How much is he behind the whole plot?  Wait and find out.
ST1, a pretty waste of time.  ST2, the completion of an old grudge match.  ST3, a bridge to get between 3 & 4.  ST4, a marvelous gift to the fans.  ST5, so bad it is not even considered part of the Star Trek canon anymore.  And then there is ST6.  Great characters, tense action, wonderful comic asides, and a plot that will keep you rivetted.

To save Kirk and McCoy from life in a Klingon penal facility and to revive the moribund peace talks, Spock and company are forced into a race against time as they seek the true culprits responsible for the crimes against Gorkon.
This is one of the better films in the TREK series.  As the Klingon General Chang, Christopher Plummer (yes, the SOUND OF MUSIC guy) gives a delightfully over-the-top performance, and fun-to-look-at Kim Cattrall (from TV's SEX AND THE CITY) is great in the role of a Vulcan Starfleet officer.  And the regular TREK cast does a pretty good job, too.  The visual and make-up FX in this film are outstanding--indeed, some of the best for TREK--and the script is well-written and packed with both action and humor.

999344,5,6305252599,"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the final film of the original-series movies, and carries the old crew out with a bang.  Returning to the action and adventure of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek VI offers space battles, show trials, murder mysteries, assassination plots, high treason, more than a little Shakespeare, and perhaps above all else, a fitting conclusion to the Kirk-Spock-McCoy era.

As every devoted fan knows, the Klingons of the original series were not the quasi-Japanese samurai of later times, but were rather depicted as parallels to America's then-foe, the Soviets.  While only rarely played out in a heavy-handed way, this theme ran throughout the series' three year run, and comes into its own in Star Trek VI.  Herein, we are confronted with a collapsing Klingon Empire, forced to seek peace because it can no longer afford war, reaching out to the Federation (America) lest it die, while many at home oppose the change (for reasons both honorable and otherwise), and many in the Federation are unwilling or unable to believe such can be true.

Even the opening scene is powerful, with the main title's climax memorably not part of the score, but rather the screen-filling explosion of the Klingon moon Praxis.  Praxis, we are told, is a key Klingon power facility, and its Chernobyl-like destruction precipitates the rest of the action, as the Empire first covers up its problems and then, as those problems prove overwhelming, turns to the Federation for the respite it needs to rebuild.

From this beginning, a Captain Spock already easing into his future role as Ambassador first opens a dialogue with the Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) and then convinces Starfleet Command to send a very unwilling Captain James T. Kirk and crew on one last mission prior to their retirement, escorting the Chancellor and his party to a peace summit on Earth.  Kirk's poignant log entries about the death of his son at the hands of Klingons (in Star Trek III) and his fears concerning the Klingons' sincerity return to haunt him as, after an assassination plot succeeds against the Chancellor and is pinned on Kirk, he and McCoy stand trial on the Klingon homeworld and are sentenced to life in the ice-moon prison camp of Rura Penthe.  From there the action only builds, as the pair try to escape their fate, the Enterprise crew tries to rescue them (and solve the murder) without provoking an interstellar war, and the traitors (on both sides, including the Klingon General Chang, beautifully played by Christopher Plummer) who carried out the original plot seek again to start that war by attacking the peace negotiators, secretly relocated to the remote Camp Khitomer.  A climactic space battle, a second near-assassination, and a quantum shift in intragalactic relations close out not only a magnificent movie but an era.

There are quibbles.  Time seems to have little meaning to the writers, who frequently have (among other things) the Enterprise traveling distances which require weeks (at least) in hours.  There is an odd scene in which the Federation President is briefed by his general staff -- and in which he barely listens to them -- while inexplicably allowing the Romulan ambassador to sit in.  In fact, the entire movie is riddled with strange moments and impossible happenings, anomalies unimaginable in any other Trek installment except perhaps the hideous Star Trek V.

It just doesn't matter.  Star Trek VI rocks.  Even as the ardent fan picks apart the most annoying errors, he finds himself engrossed in what is unarguably one of the best Star Trek -- indeed, one of the best science fiction -- stories ever.  The acting, the special effects, and above all the plot of this rollicking good tale, as well as the knowledge throughout that this is the last voyage of the original crew, makes this not only a wonderful movie, but an unforgettable good time.

999346,5,6305252599,"Following the disastrous critical and box office reception of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Paramount could have easily dropped the original cast in favor of The Next Generation.  However, sentiment prevailed and Nicholas Meyer, who directed The Wrath of Khan (still the most popular film with most Trekkers) and who co-wrote The Voyage Home (still the highest grossing Trek film), was called in.  He, along with Leonard Nimoy, fashioned a script which features most of what has made Trek endure through the years:  a relevant story drawing on then current events (i.e., the lightning paced changes in the relationship between the United States and the then Soviet Union, which precipitated the end of the Cold War), with plenty of action, drama, humor (appropriate humor, not slapstick) and character development.  Thus, the original cast would be able to exit the franchise with their heads held high.
The pacing of this film is much smoother than the earlier films (even The Wrath of Khan took too long to get moving) starting swiftly and accelerating to the pulse-pounding conclusion.  The overall tone of the film is darkier and edgier than any previous Trek.  The directing is fluid, with Meyer's camera swooping around the bridge (a notoriously difficult set to film in) and the other sets, and the editing is tight.  Although the story primarily (and correctly) focuses the action on the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock & McCoy, the supporting cast is given plenty to do as well.  Sulu, in particular--finally Captain of his own ship--has greater involvement.  Guest star Christopher Plummer molds General Chang into Trek's best villain since Khan, and David Warner makes a lends an air of dignity as Chancellor Gorkon (the name is an amalgamation of Gorbachev and Lincoln).
All of the charm of Classic Trek is here:  a final needling exchange between Spock & McCoy; the occasional, almost improvised humor; characters being thrown every which way on the bridge during battle; Kirk kissing a beautiful female; one last bit of scenery chewing from Shatner, who holds his own against fellow hamosaurus Christopher Plummer; and, finally, a bittersweet ending.
The visual effects of The Undiscovered Country (a reference to Shakespeare) hold up well, with very little use of stock shots (three effects shots from this film would later be used in 1994s Star Trek Generations).  The score by Cliff Eidelmann accentuates the activities on screen, without overshadowing them, and adds to the dark atmosphere of the film.
The picture on this DVD is excellent, with the colors, especially the maroon uniform jackets, crisp & vibrant--a vast improvement over both the VHS and LaserDisc editions.  Since the film was shot in ""matted"" Super 35, rather than Panavision, the aspect ratio is not as wide as the other Trek films.

I mean it was so horrible I was almost embarassed to be known as a Star Trek fan.  Well I decided to gamble on Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country and it was a gamble worth taking.
The plot was so, I don't know exactly how to describe it other than it was so 'Trekkish' that I immediately found myself absorbed by this fun and entertaining tale.  Co-written by Leonard Nimoy (who also co-wrote Trek IV: The Voyage Home, another winner) and directed by the man who guided us through the Wrath Of Kahn, Undiscovered Country was a feast for Trek fans of all ages.

especially McCoy (may he rest in peace) but that did nothing to keep the interest at full attention from beginning to end.

The parallels to the Soviets/Russia are  everywhere, and admittedly not hard to miss.  Instead of being simpleton  bad guys (as in Trek III) or clumsy characatures (as they often were in the  Next Generation series), here Klingons seemed like real people with real  concerns.  Different Klingons actually held differing opinions for  once!
There are times when suspension of disbelief is necessary, but the  viewer goes along willingly because the ride is absolutely worth it.  This  isn't a complicated story, but it doesn't need to be, and you'll find  yourself cheering at the right spots, too.  (My nine-year-old son jumped  off the couch yelling when Sulu said, ""Target that explosion and  FIRE!"")
Visually the movie has held up well; the space scenes are  terrific, and the zero-gravity gunplay looks very cool (including the  Klingon blood, tinted pink to avoid an R rating).
The DVD's picture and  sound quality are terrific.  The DVD doesn't have much in the way of extras  (a couple of trailers), which is too bad, but you take what you can  get.
So watch the movie again, enjoy the fun story, and maybe you'll  start thinking of Klingons as three-dimensional people.

Star Trek 6 is a much darker Star Trek but the genious  of Nicholas Myer does it with so much fun that this movie is hard to resist  it is complex as it is fun to watch and grand in scale with lavish visual  effects and , incredible acting it so much to take in and the crew reunited  again is always wonderful to see.
  An explosion has occured in the  nutral zone Captain Sulu reports the explosion , when the crew arrives at a  starfleet meeting the crew discovers that the klingons are obiding by a  peace treaty and that the Enterprise and her crew are to escort the  chancelor of the high command Gorkon but seemingly after a dinner with the  kilngons there  ship is attacked , assisting in the aid of the wounded when  they find the chanclor has been badly damage and dies they are charged and  sentenced to the penal colony of rurepente.

999483,4,6305252599,"I have special memories of Star Trek 6. My girlfriend, buddy and I were at the ceremony outside Mann's Chinese Theater, Hollywood in December 1991 when the original Classic Trek crew put their hands and feet in cement.  Then the next day we saw the first public screening of the film and were  blown away. This was a 'everything but the kitchen sink' movie lovingly  created by Nick Meyer, Leonard Nimoy and their cast and crew. Classic Trek  went out on a high with a good script, excellent performances, music score,  special effects and nostalgia. But this film is not without its' faults. I  know the story drove the jarringly militaristic attitude of the Starfleet  Commanders, but it was still a bit of a surprise. Still, Star Trek works  best when it toughens up a bit. And it was interesting to see Bill Shatner  almost managing to put a fresh spin on his 'Shatnerisms'. Only Walter  Koenig came across as a bit bemused by the whole thing in his performance.  But everyone else seemed to be enjoying it immensely. Especially George  Takei. Takei was so good as Captain Sulu it's a tragedy they don't give him  his own Trek movie, or at the very least a TV mini-series. The guy rocks!  Plot Hole: There were hundreds of delegates and soldiers down on the  surface of Khitomer. How did they get there? The Enterprise and the Klingon  Bird Of Prey have the whole sky to themselves above the planet! Was the  relatively low budget the cause for the lack of a BIG 20-ship battle? Must  be. Also, the Enterprise leaves spacedock at Earth and when Captain Kirk is  just putting his luggage away, Lieutenant Valeris arrives and tells him  they are almost at the rendezvous point! This later transpires to be at the  Klingon border. Not even Scotty's hotrod Enterprise is THAT quick! But  never mind the nitpicking too much. This film will put a lump in the throat  of all die-hard Trekkers everywhere as its sign off scene comes to pass.  Paramount needs to look at this film again to see that THIS is how you make  a great Star Trek film.",955929600,3,2039,4.566298342541437
999484,5,6305252599,I have seen this movie for years in the VHS mode and loved it but was not up to theater par.  Since I bought the DVD version it brings back movie theater splendor.

999485,4,6305252599,"Amazon/Widescreen rated this movie (DVD) as 5 for picture and 5 for sound.  Both ratings are way too high.  I love this movie and rate it 4, but the DVD is truly disappointing.  In addition to the characters' lips not  matching the sound, the sound is often distorted and muffled.  In addition,  the picture often has a line on the left side (which sometimes cannot be  corrected.)  How many times per movie do you want to stop play and run  alignment?
It seems to me that Paramount really slopped this one out  and didn't even try to make a quality DVD.  The VHS is better if you can  believe that.
I do not understand how 20th Century Fox can do such a  nice job on the old Alien and Warner Bros. can also enhance Bladerunner,  yet this Star Trek movie is absurd in quality compared to them.

999637,3,6305252599,"You know what's wrong with Trek films? It's the economics. The typical STAR TREK TV show costs about 1.3 million buks. Nope, that's not cheap, but it's peanuts compared to the price of one of these films.
That's a  problem, because the TV series takes risks and is about exploring out  society and asking the really tough questions. A $50 million-plus film  can't afford to take a risk; so it goes for the easy win.
Oh darn, the  Klingons seem to have blown up their moon and pollute their atmosphere.  What should we really nice humans do?
Lots of really cool space battle  effects. It's not enough.

999640,5,6305252599,"Saw it in the theater years ago, with Klingons and Admirals and Lieutenants and an Andorian or two, sat down and listened to some absolutely incredible music during the opening credits and, along with  everyone else, jumped a foot and a half in the air half a second after the  Director's name disappeared from the screen. Those of you who saw it in the  theater know what I'm talking about, those who only saw it on video can  imagine, and those of you who haven't seen it yet missed the best ST movie  of all, and one of the best SciFi movies of all time.
It wasn't until I'd  watched it on video a dozen or so times that I started to really appreciate  the ""damn show trial"" scene. I have it memorized, and yet every  time I watch I stop and gape at the acting.
And the final showdown scene  ""The thing's gotta have a tailpipe..."" is still exciting.
It's  in my top five movies list, and at the top of my ST Movie  list.

7886302,5,6305252599,"I spent way too looking for the version of this film that was like the VHS release!  I scoped out the reviews of various releases on DVD and Blu-ray, and narrowed it down to two choices.  On a gut-instinct, Kirkian move, I picked out this one: the one-disc release.  My main goal was to avoid the version that had the annoying flashback shots of the co-conspirators' faces during Spock's mind-meld/mind-""rape"" (if I dare call it that) of Valeris.  The rapid-fire images of each conspirator as he pulls their names from her mind is distracting to the extreme, and destroys the intensity of the scene itself.  It also insults me as a viewer of the film, because it seems as though the filmmakers consider its viewers as a little stupid, or at least suffering from memory loss, by implying that viewers cannot remember which faces coorespond with the names of certain characters in the film - even if they were mentioned early on in it.  This one-disc release does not have that annoyance.  Good thing I listened to my instinct on this one.  ~ T",1372377600,,1042,4.625
