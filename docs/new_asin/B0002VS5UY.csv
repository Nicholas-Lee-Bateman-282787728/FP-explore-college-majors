2127988,2,B0002VS5UY,"Wow, what mixed reviews!! The BAD first: For a movie that was less than 60 minutes, it was too heavy on seeing the inside of a few posh resorts and the people who own them.  Also, too much of the pretty host posing in her various bathing suits in front of her mirror, in the pool, by the falls, in the fountain, in the dining room, on the massage table, on a lounger......

  The GOOD: Some nice shots of the scenery as seen from the resorts, a quick glimpse of the volcano, a great boat ride mangrove tour, some quick glimpses of local towns from the car, a fishing trip, a cute sloth, a little shopping, dancing in nightclub, and nice waterfalls.  I feel that I have to buy another video to see Costa Rica, the people, the land, the towns, and what to expect if I go there and can't afford the posh resort.",1120953600,,808,4.187096774193549
2127989,5,B0002VS5UY,"A great video 75% natural Costa Rican beauty, 25% great hostess.  You really need to buy this!",1119744000,,94,4.529411764705882
2127990,5,B0002VS5UY,"As I said, a great video, showed me plenty 'nough to book my trip, hotels (what you think im gonna stay in a hippy hostel!) great countryside treks, rainforest tours, wildlife.  Looks like your competitions been smoking crack!  This is no infomercial (what ever the hell that means.)",1119398400,,283,4.875
2127991,1,B0002VS5UY,"DO NOT BUY  THIS DVD!  I agree with Mr.  Campos in every point.  It is awful.  I'm a native-born Costa Rican.  I believe sellers are writing some of the misleading reviews to get people to buy this awful DVD.  The video is OVERWHELMENLY hotels and spas.  The people and nature of Costa Rica are barely covered.  I am an actual (and deeply disappointed) buyer.  Breakdown:  Hotels and Spas: 75%, hostes: 15%, Nature and people:  10%.",1119052800,,432,4.613333333333333
2127992,5,B0002VS5UY,"I have to totally disagree with the last review, from T campos.  Maybe he  expected a dope smoking hippy video and couldn't be bothered to read the dvd's description?

So much of Costa Rica is covered in this dvd, just read the description!

Damas Mangrove tour, deep sea fishing off Quepos, Manuel Antonio National Park, Monteverde Cloud Forest Tours, Volcano Arenal, the beautiful beaches of the Central Pacific Coast and the La Paz Waterfalls. Featuring outstanding boutique hotels and spas such as Xandari Resort & Spa, La Mansion at Manuel Antonio, La Mansion at Lake Arenal, Villa Caletas, Monteverde Lodge, Hotel Alta and much more.

What more could you ask for!!! A volcanic eruption?  Oh wait, there is that in the dvd!

I mean you gotta be pretty stupid to expect something else after reading a dvd cover's description and then demanding more.  Its like buying a book on deep sea fishing and then expecting information on fly fishing!

And the host?  She's amazing!",1114387200,,975,4.890243902439025
2127993,2,B0002VS5UY,"This DVD shows very little of Costa Rica.  It is an infomercial for spas, hotels, and tourist companies.  I was looking for something that would cover the different regions, wildlife, and people.  I can find hotels, spas, etc. online.  The host is even annoying; I think she was trying to make her modeling debut.  This DVD covers very little of anything.  Disappointing.",1114387200,,371,4.903225806451613
2127994,4,B0002VS5UY,"Having a mother from Costa Rica, I found that this documentary really espressed the true realism of what makes Costa Rica so unique. It truely is a magical experience to travel to this country. I myself learned of several hidden places this exquisite country had to offer that I did not know of myself. It is well worth buying the DVD. Waiting for a second volume to come out. Hurry !",1113696000,,384,4.422535211267606
2127995,5,B0002VS5UY,"You must but this dvd.  I loved the hidden spa and hot springs, hidden underneath the volcano, very magical.",1111276800,,108,4.684210526315789
2127996,5,B0002VS5UY,I loved this video and especially the young energetic host. she was great to watch her explore my lovely costa rica.  fantastic camera work and the scenery was simply breathtaking.,1111104000,,180,5.0
2127997,5,B0002VS5UY,"As Patsy Stone (from AB Fab) would say, ""this video is smashing Eddy!""

The video shows exactly what it advertises, no complaints, in fact I have modelled my Moroccan, I mean Costan Rican vacation around it.",1111017600,,207,4.75
2127998,5,B0002VS5UY,"Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed this dvd.  We bought the dvd after reading carefully the description of it.  The description shows exactly what's on the dvd.  Great hotels, beautiful Costa Rica, deep sea fishing, amazing horse back tour across mountains and through a forest!!!  We also loved the mango tour, very exotic and really well filmed.  The host is great, adds a really modern, youthful and energetic touch.

Like most travel shows you see hotels, tours, restaurants, local areas, shopping, wild animals, car rides, great music and a fantastic host.

I think I deserve a free dvd for that review!!!",1110931200,,611,4.99009900990099
2127999,2,B0002VS5UY,"I have to disagree with the positive reviews of the DVD written here.  In fact, I purchased this Costa Rica Traveler's Guide because everyone was so enthusiastic.  It was just terrible.  My friend and I are going in April, and are trying to figure out what to do and see.  This was nothing more than an extended informercial - segments discussing very specific hotels, resorts, and tours.  It just seemed like everyone had paid to have thier places shown..!  No discussion of the regions, the options, the choices.  Just an uncomfortable, terrible actress shilling for the producer's friend's resorts.  Save your money and just tivo 'Costa Rica' and watch the Travel Channel.",1110672000,,675,4.964285714285714
2128000,5,B0002VS5UY,"What a fantastic travel video and such a beautiful host.  I can't wait to go to Costa Rica and search out all those tours and hotels fit for a king, or Raj!",1109721600,,156,3.875
2128001,5,B0002VS5UY,"My husband bought me this video and i just love it so much.  Really looking forward to my vacation in the summer.

This video is beautifully shot and shows the natural beauty of costa rica.  The hotels are fantasic and so are the amazing tours.",1109635200,,244,4.377777777777778
2128002,5,B0002VS5UY,i'm look forward to my vacation to Costa Rica after watching this dvd.,1109635200,,70,4.461538461538462
2128003,5,B0002VS5UY,"I just watched this video and found it to be very helpful.  it shows exactly what it advertises on the DVD case, something which other travel videos don't deliver on.

great fishing trip scenes, very beautifully shot.  had me in tears!!!",1109376000,,237,4.7317073170731705
2128004,1,B0002VS5UY,"unless you want to see a smattering of very expensive hotels, spas, tour companies, etc, etc, etc. Hopefully you get the idea. It's pretty, but it doesn't really give a true overview of the country or even a small part of it.",1109289600,,225,4.380952380952381
2128005,5,B0002VS5UY,"This is a very helpful video in trying to decide on different areas, hotels and what to see and do in Costa Rica.  The host is great and the scenes are breathtaking. Our kids especially liked the shots of the sloth and my wife loves horse back riding so she's gonna enjoy the mountain forest horse back tour.",1107302400,,308,4.310344827586207
2128006,5,B0002VS5UY,"I loved this video, Villa Caletas is my favorite hotel in the world so I really just bought this dvd to see the hotel again!  The music in this travel video is amazing,  you guys should sell the soundtrack!",1105056000,,206,4.256410256410256
2128007,5,B0002VS5UY,"A really great video and plenty of rainforest shots, natural beauty, deep sea fishing, costa rican animals,  (including a rare glimpse of a sloth in the day time!)  I love horses so I'm looking forward to the horse back mountain tour as featured in the video when I go to Costa Rica in the Summer.

After all the tours and adventure it's great to see such elegant and stylish boutiques and kind, generous locals.  Unfortunetly too many Americans still see Costa Rica as a Central American wilderness and only to be touched with a surf board and wearing the designer dreadlocks.  The contrast couldn't be different, Costa Rica has entered the new millenium, finally kicking off its scruffy backpacker image and dope smoking hippies.",1105056000,,731,4.862903225806452
2128008,5,B0002VS5UY,"This is a fantastic travel guide to Costa Rica, a country I love returning to again and again.  Hopefully this video will encourage you to travel around the country by car, explore rainforests, mango tours, fishing trips, an amazing butterfly park and beautiful luxury hotels.

Lastly the host is incredible, she should be on T.V!",1105056000,,330,4.9818181818181815
2128009,5,B0002VS5UY,"I found this travel guide on Costa Rica very interesting and different from all the other stereotyped travel videos out there.  This really is a great video, the film work is incredible and the host is truly gorgeous!

I was expecting the usual hippy, backpacker guide to costa rica and what I got was National Geographic film work, rainforests, natural wildlife and animals, truly outstanding (quality) hotels and breathtaking views of the beautiful countryside.

If you're expecting a hippy guide to Costa Rica then this isn't for you, this is aimed at the more open minded, true hearted traveller.

One of my favorite scenes was the mango swamp tour, think ""apocalypse now"" and Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" and you won't be disapointed.",1105056000,,746,5.040650406504065
2128010,1,B0002VS5UY,"This is nothing but an infomercial about 5 expensive hotels and the tours they can arrange for you. There is little or nothing about the history, culture, or points of local interest. Plenty of shots of the hotel rooms and swimming pools, and how to get a massage from a Parisian with a bad accent.

It is narrated by some valley girl who is more interested in showing you her bikini than the country. Gushy dialog but at least she gets the pronunciation correct.

This is not a travelogue, it is an embarrassing waste of time.",1104364800,,527,4.479166666666667
2128011,5,B0002VS5UY,"As a frequent visitor to Costa Rica I was impressed with the choice of hotels reviewed in this video.  If you are interested in getting a foreglimpse of some of the best places to stay and dine, as well as hooking up with the country's best tour guides and deep sea fishing charters, I would say this video is for you.  Rooms at the hotels recommended are still cheap by U.S. standards, so they represent great value to the U.S. visitor, and a steal for Europeans. Ditto restaurants.

On the other hand, if you are a backpacker looking for $15 a night room at a hostel, I would not recommend this video, nor would I recommend it if you are in search of an ""Endless Summer"" surf video.  The coverage of national parks such as Monteverde, Damas Estuary and MA is good, but I would suggest if you are looking for a National Geographic nature video, that's what you should buy.  This video truly is a Traveler's Guide for the upscale traveler.

2128012,5,B0002VS5UY,"I have been to Costa Rica every year since 1992, and this is the best travel documentary I have seen on this beautiful country.  The guide travels through the country showing the BEST Costa Rica has to offer.  Do not miss this video as it previews the special gem of a hotel, Villa Caletas, and a secret hot springs that greatly rivals Tabacon.  I watched a number of travel videos on Costa Rica and this is the most current and comprehensive video available - it's even entertaining!!!  Watch this video and plan the trip of a lifetime.",1098144000,,537,4.505154639175258
2128013,1,B0002VS5UY,"This DVD shows the hostess donning a vast array of outfits, from designer bikinis to evening dresses. She also shows you how to accessorize with flowers. Covered topics include proper walking technique with high heels on jungle trails, best approaches for posing and how to be in most if not all shots.

The glow of Arenal volcano is definetely no match for Aria's lip gloss, those lips look more humid than the mangrove forest.

All in all, if you're a big fan of Ms. Alexandra, don't miss this DVD. Oh, and she's like, in Costa Rica or something.",1098144000,,548,4.581632653061225
2128014,5,B0002VS5UY,"Because you're definitely going to be wanting one after viewing this gorgeous video featuring fantastic hotels, great hot spots, and the exotic scenery of Costa Rica!

Aria Alexandra graciously invites you to come along with her and her intrepid film crew, as they explore the natural beauty of Costa Rica by land and sea.  In my opinion, Travel Sophisticate has created something very special here.  Well written, skillfully directed and photographed, this video is sure to become THE Traveler's Guide for Costa Rica.",1097625600,,518,5.216867469879518
2128015,5,B0002VS5UY,"I would recommend this video to anyone interested in learning more about Costa Rica travel and wildlife.  Great shots of monkeys, sloths, hummingbirds, Arenal, etc.

2128016,5,B0002VS5UY,This is the best DVD documentary I've seen on Costa Rica.  I used it to plan our honeymoon which was the best trip I ever had.  Very informative and entertaining.,1093046400,,162,4.366666666666666
8033448,2,B0002VS5UY,"Something is strange about some of the other reviews.  I.e. I was reading one of the other reviews, and noticed that one review by ""Romano"" starts at the very beginning with the phrase ""As I said, a great video""  Did the reviewer say this before??  That's at the start of the review that he says this.  But wait, there's another review by ""John"", written very close in date to Romano's, for this video that starts with ""A great video.""  Could Romano be the same person as John?  They both gave the video 5 stars and seem to be referencing each other...  And it doesn't stop there, I noticed there's a whole slew of 5 star reviews gushing about how wonderful the video is and all sounding strangely similar in tone...  Something's fishy.  My guess is that the producer or someone got worried that this video was getting bad ratings, so they created a whole bunch of fictional names and used them to give out 5 star ratings.  Shameless.  If the video was good to begin with, then someone wouldn't need to do this.

The back of this video says that it includes info on ""six exclusive boutique hotels and spas.""  That it does, and one of those fishy 5 star reviewers defends the plethora of hotel info by saying that 'that's what the back of the case says.'  Yes the back of the case says that, I and others just thought it wouldn't be so shameless and blatantly obvious that this is the main focus of the film.  I thought it would have been a little more integrated.  Overall there's too much on hotels and the hostess prancing around in her skimpy outfits, and not enough on Costa Rica

However the film has some nice scenery in places and a decent soundtrack, but a more accurate title would be ""Costa Rica: A Traveler's Guide to Certain Upscale Hotels and Spas - Also Includes Brief Overview of Some Famous Tourist Destinations""",1252540800,,1828,4.490909090909091
8033449,2,B0002VS5UY,I personally didn't CARE for this video. I wanted to see a more comprehensive view of places to stay while traveling in Costa Rica. It seemed to cater to the refined high end traveler vs family or adventure traveler.,1156723200,,216,4.564102564102564
8033450,1,B0002VS5UY,"This video should just be sold to people who are using ""Travel Sophisticate"" (the sponsor of this DVD) for tours and are interested in finding out about the hotels and the tours they offer. The DVD is very limited and is purely an advertisement for the hotels they offer.

The video spends most of the time INSIDE hotels...and whenever the host is NOT in the hotel, she's on a tour organized by the hotels...and even then, the sightseeing is only 10-15% of the ""movie"".

It's all an advertisement and is a waste of money, not to mention time.

For those who really want to see Costa Rica and find out more about the people, the culture, different national parks, the party life in different towns, the beach life, etc., this video is NOT FOR US.

All it does is show you a few hotels in a FEW places in Costa Rica who I'm sure is linked to ""Travel Sophisticate"". It spends a LOT OF TIME zooming in on vases and paintings in hotel rooms, and the host sitting in spas. Oh, and they zoom in on the food they serve in the hotels. And oh, they interview hotel owners. Ooooh, big f-n deal.

Most people who want to go to Costa Rica want adventure and to see the country for its natural beauty, as well as to find out about the culture and the people and the nightlife.

It can't be said enough times that this video is a waste of money. It's such a rip-off!!!! It should just be sold to those who are 60years old and over and are just in Costa Rica to hang out in hotels. And they're not even the better hotels in costa rica!

DON'T BUY IT! WASTE OF MONEY.",1149811200,,1550,4.216216216216216
8033451,1,B0002VS5UY,"ok, well i guess ill list the positives first: The film is only 52 minutes long, and there's monkeys - that's about it. Anything else that may be somewhat entertaining/educational is due to the country itself, not the way it was shot. That annoying thing blocking the camera is the host, who also provides a pointless narration. About 20 minutes is wasted watching her eat something, blocking a nice sunset, or trying to pull off a personality. Another half hour is spent listening to ex-american hotel/resort owners babbling about the posh sense of style of their establishments.

Once you get past the out-of-place host, shaky camera, infommercials, and tons of filler, there is some nice ""stock footage"". If you plan on taking a trip there, this will probably not help you in any way. Buy the books.",1147996800,,802,4.854014598540146
8033452,3,B0002VS5UY,"Wow, I can't believe the passions that this video has aroused in

my fellow travelers here on Amazon.com. I bought and watched

this video out of curiousity and because I have been to Costa

Rica and Central America many times.

1) OK, parts of the video is shameless promotion of a few

  expensive hotels and spas but that in itself is not so bad.

  It is just that so much was left out. They left out some

  other expensive hotels particularly in the Quepos area that

  would put the ones in the video to shame because they are

  much more beautiful, elegant and worth more for your money.

2) The film quality of the video itself is very good and even

  beautiful in the parts where the lovely hostess is not

  prancing around a few select hotels and spas. 30 more

  minutes of nature and this video would have been 4 stars.

3)  If you have never been to Costa Rica you will see some of it

  in this video and it looks great, unfortunately there is not

  much variety. The hostess herself tells you in the last few

  minutes of the video that she is sad that her 2 weeks in

  Costa Rica have come to an end. Well, there you go! Two weeks

  of very fast, albeit decent camera work is what you get.

4)  Buy the used video version and maybe you won't feel so bad

  about the price and the lack of depth and variety. Remember,

  up-to-date videos about Costa Rica and Central America in

  general are rare. Even the 2005 Globetrekker video did not

  do such a great job on presenting Costa Rica and especially

  did a poor presentation on Nicaragua.

Good luck on your travels in beautiful Costa Rica. It is not to

be missed and it is getting more and more expensive every minute!! Don't forget beautiful but forgotten Nicaragua !

You won't be disappointed!! Pura Vida !!",1142985600,,1792,4.313846153846153

For those of you that want to stay in a louse pit, a hippy drug commune in the depths of a rain forest then i wouldn't suggest you buy this dvd.  Also don't buy this if you are expecting the mating habits of sloths or a detailed analysis of the south american eco system.

 The dvd's description actually lists ""boutique"" hotels, it even names them!  It doesn't mention stuff that isn't in the DVD, some of those other ""reviews"" are just plain stupid, obviously written by morons!

Look, here's what these guys filmed and include in their dvd.....

 Damas Mangrove tour, deep sea fishing off Quepos, Manuel Antonio National Park, Monteverde Cloud Forest Tours, Volcano Arenal, the beautiful beaches of the Central Pacific Coast and the La Paz Waterfalls. Featuring outstanding boutique hotels and spas such as Xandari Resort & Spa, La Mansion at Manuel Antonio, La Mansion at Lake Arenal, Villa Caletas, Monteverde Lodge, Hotel Alta and much more.

So after reading this description, please don't go expecting a view of costa rica from outer space!  Or a frank but fair documentary on Colonel Oliver North's Contra affair and its effect on the economy of Costa Rica.  Simply put, if you read the DVD's description and then expect an epic voyage around the world in 80 days then you need to restart your course of medication.",1121644800,,1511,4.681818181818182

And I'm sorry guys, but she is NOT amazing.  We kept waiting for the informative stuff to come, but it never happened.  We are not backpackers, looking for $15 a night places, nor are we interested in spending as much as possible in a trendy European resort.  (From that perspective, it DID feel like a promo for these resorts.  Period.)  We wanted to see more diverse everything, including common sense hotels, transportation, etc.  If you are interested in learning more about Costa Rica, buy the books, not this video.  If you're over twenty five years old, you'll be disappointed, I promise you.",1121126400,,919,4.723270440251572
