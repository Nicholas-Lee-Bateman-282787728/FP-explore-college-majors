8146272,5,B000IMV3NI,"This, the last film by the great Fellini, is charming and comical. The DVD is excellent with the quality of sound and vision excellent. Unfortunately, the version I bought from Germany has no English subtitles.",1431907200,2,210,5.0285714285714285
8146273,5,B000IMV3NI,"I've been trying to view a version of this amazing movie for years, but could not.  The last person who told me I had to see it threw down the gauntlet and I had to make it happen.  Bought a SIMPLE to use all regions dvd player and never looked back.  What fun.  This is a fascinating film that I had missed in the art theaters.  The company I've ordered from - Veicosell - is professional, great shippers, and seem to have a collection of hard to find, unforgettable movies.  I'm so grateful.",1395273600,2,493,4.247311827956989
8146274,3,B000IMV3NI,"But since it's  Federico Fellini 's final film,I will watch it anyway on my computer and practice my Italian! Caveat Emptor!",1370044800,,124,4.904761904761905
8146275,1,B000IMV3NI,The fact that the English Translation of the title is put in parenthesis in the listing makes one think that the movie has subtitles.  The lack of English subtitles should be right in the comment field of the sellers.  There is no excuse for this not being totally explicit.  It does say Italian under subtitles in one place but this is not expected as it is an Italian film anyway and is easily overlooked.,1363305600,,407,4.472972972972973
8146276,5,B000IMV3NI,"This film needs repeat viewings.  It gets better and better and better.  It's easy to write off this film, I guess - Fellini's last, doesn't live up to 8 1/2, blah, blah, blah.  La Voce Della Luna has more originality and poetry than most films that have come out since.  Fellini, it seems, has fallen out of favor with the movie-going public.  Too bad.  It seems all we have left are passing references to La Strada, 8 1/2 and La Dolce Vita.  Oh, and the word ""paparazzi"".  Just wrote this basically to bump it's score a little.  Fellini will find his champion one day.",1322524800,6,570,4.403846153846154
8146277,2,B000IMV3NI,"LA VOCE DELLA LUNA is Fellini's last film and alledgely his worst one. That's surely due to the presence of the obnoxious Mr. Roberto Benigni who can damage anything he touches. Fellini is in my opinion the greatest film maker of all-time and his work is practically composed only of masterpieces, among them the greatest film ever made, OTTO E MEZZO (EIGHT AND A HALF).
I only bought La Voce della Luna because it was the only one I had not in my collection up till now.",1319414400,2,471,4.425287356321839
8146278,5,B000IMV3NI,"In my opinion this is a wonderful movie. It is a deep analysis of the modern society and how dark is the future without Poetry: the only people that try to get the meaning of life in the movie are the characters that are very ""different"" from the rest of the society and that can see behind the model that the television has been trying to duplicate.
The movie ends with the phrase from Benigni: ""Se tutti facessimo un po' di silenzio, forse potremmo capire"". Meaning if we all be silent, maybe we'll be able to understand.",1302566400,3,523,4.402061855670103
8146279,2,B000IMV3NI,"This is my least favorite Fellini film, and honestly, it's his worst film.  It never got distribution in the USA, and it's only sporadically appears at Fellini retrospectives.  There's a reason that it's not shown widely because it simply isn't very good.  There were times I had trouble staying awake quite frankly.  There are some choice moments throughout the film (mainly a scene on rooftops that occurs early in the film), but there are also bizarre, heavy handed moments when Fellini uses ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" by Michael Jackson (!).  It's not bizarre in a Felliniesque way, but in a way where it doesn't work.  Fellini shows a bunch of kids mindlessly dancing to Michael Jackson, then shows an elderly couple waltzing, a contrast in entertainment styles.  It's obvious and ponderous and is completely missing the poetry that is in previous Fellini works.

Roberto Benigni stars in this film (way before his Life is Beautiful), and he's quite engaging.  Aside from some nice cinematography, this film is an extremely disappointing addition to the Fellini cannon, and it's rather sad that it turned out to be his final film.  It doesn't diminish his earlier accomplishments (like winning 4 Best Foreign Film Oscars), but it's never fun to see a genius like Fellini go out on a whimper.",1229299200,3,1296,4.9036697247706424
8146280,3,B000IMV3NI,"Finally, finally...FINALLY La Voce de la Luna appears on DVD and what, no subtitles? I saw a poor VHS dupe of this film about eight years ago. No, it is not great Fellini, but what was great Fellini after AMACORD? However, it is the valedictory film from a man who was arguably the greatest Italian film-maker of all time. I once hoped that Martin Scorsese, who saved INTERVISTA from oblivion, might take this lost film under his wing and sponsor it in this country, but my hope has faded. As I said, interesting Fellini and essential for understanding his work. Let's hope that a subtitled version or even (God help me) a dubbed version appears on DVD",1162166400,5,652,4.581196581196581
