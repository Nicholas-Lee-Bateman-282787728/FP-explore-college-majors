My grandfather's forefathers came from Basel, Switzerland. So, this film was very exciting to see, especially for my mother. And to learn of the country's founding fathers.

I had visited Switzerland with my mother when I was young. And our experience was a different one. This film gives a broader picture than just spending some sweet summer days with family in small Swiss towns.

No doubt, Switzerland is more rich than just Swiss chocolate, gourmet cheeses, Swiss watches, and international banking. Even though, that alone says a lot.

Overall, both my parents loved the fine Swiss experience. It was magnificent! They watched this film after a very long, hard day at the hospital. Now, they are going to bed and dreaming of all that beautiful Alpine scenery! Thank you to the film's director/producer and crew who made such a wonderful film.",1512950400,,1003,5.097560975609756
