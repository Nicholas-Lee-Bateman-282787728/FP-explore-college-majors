2530485,5,B000ER5NSS,"I saw this little gem at the Miami Film Festival a couple of years ago and couldn't get it out of my mind.  It's about a young woman whose budding sexuality gets her in trouble (she sleeps with her mother's boyfriend) so she runs away from home to a resort commuinty high in the mountains somewhere in Austraila.  There she meets a young man she develops a fancy for, but he is dealing with issues of his own.  This was a magnificent film that deserved far more theatrical atttention than it got.  Film Festival crowds loved it!  I talked to programmers of film festivals who raved about it.  But, for some reason theatrical distributors gave it only nominal attention.  Now's your chance to see it.  You'll be amazed at how much of a Nicole Kidman look alike the young female lead is - a dead ringer!  Enjoy!",1151193600,6,809,4.448979591836735
2530486,2,B000ER5NSS,"Reviews of this movie are a definite case of Indie-Hype. It was

certainly not ""sexy and dreamy,"" as one review claimed. This is another slow, somnolent, gritty movie about the young floundering about trying to find themselves. You've seen other movies like this before. It was somewhat reminiscent of Rain and In the Mood For Love, but thankfully, not as slow as those films. If those movies are in a coma, this one is just depressed. It is a modestly interesting movie if you can stand the slow pace of this foreign independent film.

Set in Australia, Somersault is the story of a young girl who is

promiscuous and out of control. Let loose in a macho country among opportunistic, emotionally stunted, and intoxicated males, her experiences are not in any way, ""dreamy."" If this movie is in any way an accurate picture of Australian males, then I am very sorry for Australian females. The main character is pretty much used and discarded. There are some exceptions, but not that much. Her experiences certainly don't look fulfilling. Although the writer/director is female, I didn't feel that the main female character was true to life. She doesn't suffer that much from her mistreatment. She seems to regard it with an unlikely impassivity. At other times she

displays a boldness and seductiveness that would have been more likely in a woman twice her age. The portrayal of various loutish males rings much more true to life, in fact, young women could study this movie to find out why they want to wait before having sex with someone.

Viewers are treated to various drab, dingy settings even though the movie is set in a ski resort. Why is it that

social democracies like England and Australia keep producing drab, dingy, depressed movies? What is it about support for the arts, universal health care and free college tuition that makes people want to make movies like this? I'm not a fan the excesses of capitalism, but at least it cuts down on the number of somnolent, depressed, drab, movies that a country creates. Something to think about. Momentum--it's not a bad thing. Try it. It won't kill you.

This movie is modestly interesting for those who can tolerate slow independent movies. This movie could have a real value in showing young women how men are likely to treat a female who shares her body too easily. It's pretty true to life in that

respect.",1147564800,6,2370,4.763414634146342
2530487,3,B000ER5NSS,"SOMERSAULT, a 2004 Australian production which won several Aussie Oscars, is now about to appear in LA's art theaters. I didn't see any compelling reason why it should during an invitation-only pre-screen.

Blonde teenager Heidi (Abbie Cornish) lives in Canberra with her single Mom, Nicole (Olivia Pigeot). In the first of several bad choices, Heidi makes a clumsy attempt to seduce her mother's tattooed boyfriend (Damien De Montemas) - an attempt that's in the first stage of success (because men are sexual pigs) when Nicole walks in. Mom, of course freaks out, driving Heidi to run away by boarding a bus to an Australian winter playground, a dreary place with little play in evidence except a lot of boorish young people getting drunk, only marginal snow, and no shrimps on the barbie.

Afraid of loneliness, Heidi begins looking for love in all the wrong places, and eventually forms a fitful relationship with Joe (Sam Worthington), a young man who herds cattle on his emotionally distant father's ranch. Joe, while outwardly the coolest guy in town, is apparently also undergoing a sexual identity crisis of his own. (For a brief moment, I thought we might veer off into a Down Under version of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, but, mercifully, the director/writer careened back onto the main road just in time.) Meanwhile, Heidi gets a job clerking in a gas station mini-mart and rents an untenanted flat from a local woman - unoccupied because the woman's son is off in prison.

The acting performances are competent enough; the characters are refreshingly everyday real rather than glamorous. SOMERSAULT isn't a bad film, but it struck me as one that might have been considered edgy when produced by Hollywood twenty years ago. Now, it's not worth the ten bucks you'll pay to see it on the American Big Screen. Yes, by the end, Heidi has begun to discover the differences between love, sex, and friendship and is making the transition to street smart Grown-Up, but I just left the theater with a shrug thinking, ""OK, so?""",1145404800,5,2020,4.935294117647059

2530505,4,B000ER5NSS,"An Australian teenager takes her new-found sexuality out for a test drive to Jindabyne in this award-winning film. As you might expect, her results are less than stellar. Our heroine is clearly drifting between childhood and adulthood but her focus is always tactile. Watch how she caresses her scrapbook or her lover's fingertips.

Winner of 13 awards at the Australian Film Institute in 2004, including Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Film, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor and Actress, I found this DVD (with captions!) at Amazon.com.

These four won those acting awards:
  * Sam Worthington (""The Debt"" and ""Man on a Ledge"") is Joe, a young man who works for his father on his cattle station and also does the occasional mechanic's job. He is a bit of a rounder, but next to our flighty heroine, he is a rock!
  * Abbie Cornish (""Limitless"" and ""Bright Star"") portrays Heidi, trying out her wings, making ill-advised choices for bad reasons and not yet settled enough to learn from them. Joe says ""She's like my mom's perfume: Mom would spray a mist in the air and then walk through it. I can still feel Heidi on my skin...""
  * Lynette Curran (lots of TV) is Irene, the generous proprietor of the Jindabyne motel where our heroine lands. This hard-working gal has her own set of problems but tries to help when she can.
  * Erik Thomson (""The Boys are Back"") has a small but pivotal role as Richard, the gay neighbor who is moving away. His character has an intelligence and a stillness that I found very appealing.

This PG-13 film has some fisticuffs, lots of nudity and alcohol (remember, it's Australian), but no vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff.

I was impressed by this film.",1328486400,,1698,4.71864406779661
2530506,5,B000ER5NSS,"I was mesmerized by Abbie Cornish throughout the entire movie. Her beauty and her depiction of a naive and confused young woman were spellbinding. Abbie gives a wonderfully sensitive and effective portrayal of adolescent angst. I've heard a mother describe her daughter in just such a way - ""She has the body of a woman but the brain of a child."" The director, Cate Shortland, is spot-on in this engrossing film. FYI, Cate has just finished another full-length feature - ""Lore"" - which is now in post-production. It's one of the most anticipated films of 2012.",1327017600,,560,4.84375
2530507,2,B000ER5NSS,"Park City or Jackson Hole translated to Australia? Just what I don't need! Before ""Somersault"", I don't think I'd ever seen an Australian movie that didn't show me something fresh, some emotional or psychological originality. ""Somersault"" is well filmed, I suppose, and the scenery is rich, but that's all. It's as trite and predictable as any B-rate melodrama about a teenage runaway from a trailer court in Oklahoma. The acting by the male characters is TV level at best. The script is awful. I couldn't sit it out. I'd rather watch wombats cavorting on the Nature Channel.",1314921600,4,575,4.938144329896907
2530508,5,B000ER5NSS,"Abbie Cornish delivers an Academy Award worthy performance in this under-appreciated film.  I had never heard of her before and was blown away by the depth of this young girls ability.  I can't say the film has a happy ending, but it does have a hopeful ending.  It is painful to watch sometimes as Heidi (Abbie Cornish) makes terrible adolescent mistakes.  She is such a likable character that I found myself cringing as she did things that would scar her forever.  Nonetheless,  she survives and gains a little wisdom along the way.  Sam Worthington also delivers a strong supporting performance.  As far as I am concerned this is a must see.  I might add that viewers should follow their viewing of Somersault with a look at Candy.  In Candy, Abbie Cornish stars with the late Heath Ledger and once again delivers an amazing performance (as does Heath Ledger).",1300406400,,863,4.77027027027027

2530510,4,B000ER5NSS,"Somersault is a very special film. This is what I called an art film because it is not a big Hollywood movie or a Cinderella Story. It is a very sensitive story about self discovering of two people through their experiences and their choices. Abbie Cornish and Sam Worthington give such strong and amazing performances in their respective roles, they can be moving, disturbing and at the same time makes you think about what it means to grow as a person. Heidi (played by Abbie) is a young disturbed teenage girl of 16 years old that has a self destructive path, the way I see it, she is trying so bad to find someone that will love and care for her that she keeps making bad choices and so she keeps collecting broken hearts and despair. She falls in love with Joe (played by Sam Worthington) but he seems in a point in his life where he doesn't quite know who he is and what he wants in life. That's where comes the most interesting point in this movie it is their relationnship. Through each other and their experiences together they will learn valuable lessons about themselves. It is a very sensitive and poignant story. If you are looking for something different about what it means to be human and trying to find yourself, this is an excellent story with very good talented actors!",1267833600,,1288,4.5085470085470085

2530513,5,B000ER5NSS,"Abbie Cornish is hot. Talented. This film feels like a dream, a waking dream everybody's had at one point or another. It captures the complexities of self, sex, intimacy, and all around relationships in a very profound but innocent way - it doesn't forget that deep down we are all scared little children. The cinematography is striking and simply gorgeous. Takes you to that place you wish you never left.",1239840000,,406,4.814285714285714
2530514,5,B000ER5NSS,"Heidi (Abbie Cornish) has no boundaries. Heidi tries to seduce her mother's boyfriend, gets caught and gets thrown out of the house. Unsure of what to do with herself, Heidi takes a bus from Canberra to Jindabyne-a ski resort town. In strange attempts to bring love and stability to her world, Heidi tries to seduce every man who crosses her path-a man who gives her a glance from a car, another who eyes her once across the bar, a man she's asking for a job. One night she meets Joe-a wealthy young man working his father's station who realizes he's a big fish is a small town. While Heidi futilely attempts to make human connections in a world that has labeled her ""rough trade"" and worthless at the tender age of 16, Joe attempts to discard the antipodean cliches that signal manhood.

I've never witnessed a film that captures the New Zealand/Australian national character so brilliantly-feelings kept in check, the lack of mercy shown to the naive, class awareness. Subtle but extremely emotional. Watch this one closely. One of my favourite films. Highly recommended.

If you like this film, I'd recommend the 2001 New Zealand film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain/dp/B00007L4LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain</a>-an equally emotional coming of age film.

2530515,4,B000ER5NSS,"Very tough little film and a totally believable performance by Cornish as Heidi and the male lead who convey the confusion of sex with love, a damaging and prevalent feature of contemporary life. The male is equally confused about his sexuality, aware that Heidi harbours even greater neediness than himself, albeit with less potentially damaging outcomes. The interpay with the child who has Aspergers syndrome echoes much of Heidi's behaviour. Her resort to what appears a very adolescent diary and her enacment in front of the mirror will disturb as it elucidates. Her curiosity about the lad, and a flash of her observing him on a trampoline suggest her realization of this. Congratulations to the team that accomplished this masterful and moving story. I reckon it's tackled an extremley urgent issue with sensitive aplomb.",1232668800,,828,5.186567164179104
2530516,4,B000ER5NSS,"A very good film about a sensitive subject. I was in a relationship with a person like Heidi's character in the film once, who came out of similar circumstances. Only it didn't have a happy ending like this film. The director/writer wants to make it a coming of age story but a person like Heidi has a personality disorder, close to borderline personality one might guess, and probably based on someone the director knows.

You don't grow out of this sort of personality so easily. It's touched on when the boyfriend finds her in her apt with two boys and she claims she did it because she felt neglected. The way she comes back at him when he suggests she has a problem is typical of this personality (and she was right of course, that he had a problem too). This sort of Lolita relationship doesn't take place in a vacuum. In reality it would take two people a long time to get over this, and most likely the girl would continue acting out for many years to come, perhaps into her late 20s or until she sought therapy.

So four stars for a very poignant portrayal of a kind of personality that goes beyond the norm, and of entanglements that occur when another sort of personality comes along. One star off for the pseudo-happy ending, where she goes home to her mother and it appears everything will be OK, which rings false.

Fiction takes license with these things but the director seems to be striving for emotional realism. In real life the same patterns would most likely be re-enacted again and again over many years.

Still this is a film well worth watching, esp for anyone who knows someone like Heidi. Or is like Heidi themselves.",1217894400,4,1643,4.521885521885522
2530517,4,B000ER5NSS,"This is a pretty good movie overall I thought.  I caught it on the Sundance channel.

It's about a teenage girl who gets into a big argument with her mother and ends up running away from home.

In that town where she runs away to she ends up being sort of like 'the girl from the wrong side of the tracks' for awhile.  At such a young age this can be very harmful.

This movie reminds us that with personal relationships everyone has issues going on.  Besides the teenage runaway her main boyfriend has some deep issues going on.  Her mother has some problems.  The lady who gives her a room to stay in has some major problems.  Etc..

She had some problems along the way but fortunately enough good things happened that everything turned out sort of ok.  It's a more or less positive story but with a somewhat inconclusive ending.  We can at least assume that this girl will look back on her adventure with some happy memories and learning experiences.

We know in real life that when a young girl runs away from home by herself many things can happen.  Bad things that is.  If the worse that could happen is the things in this movie that would be great.

2530518,5,B000ER5NSS,"This is a sharp film.  As I interpet it, it is a film about people who are out of place.  Each character has neither found what they are looking for nor decided what they are pursuing.  It's a wonderful and familiar journey to watch.

The lead character, Heidi (played seamlessly by the actress Abbie Cornish), is a young person in search mode.  She's not sure what she wants, but she is moved by her desires.  Like me, she collects imagery.  She carries with her a scrapbook of fragments of napkins, magazine pictures, written ideas, greeting cards, and other things torn from her travels.  She carries them with her throughout her life to remember where she has been.  The images may not give her clarity and they may not help her determine where she's going to next, but they help her not forget the beauty she glimpsed in memorable moments that have disappeared.

Heidi starts the movie by being caught making out with her mother's boyfriend.  This leads her to leave home and to begin looking for work and a place to live on her own.  Prematurely, she has to define her world, her work, and her social structures on her own, with very little exposure to or knowledge of the complexities of those important matters.

This film is interested in intelligently exploring, watching, and capturing developing sensory drives and cognitive interpretations.  The film has been controversial because of it's candid sexual situations.  But the controversy is misplaced.  The sexual content is real and necessary for the high degree of intellectual investigation into the multi-layered honest stories.

In one scene, Heidi finds a storage room with a stranger's abandoned family photo albums and memorabilia.  Like Heidi, we don't know any of the people. The images have no associative meaning to us.  Yet we can sympathize with the human activity of carefully and painstakingly saving images, objects and ideas from our pasts.  The scene asks the viewer:  What do we keep?  How do we arrange it?  What memories do we take care to frame?

As Heidi asks in the film, the film is an exploration of this question:

""What do you do if you like someone?""

And what do we do with objects that have emotional content for us personally?

What do we see?  What do we feel?  What do we taste, hear, and smell?  How do they all combine into intoxicating cocktails?

The cinematography regularly asks the question:  What is out of focus?  What is clear?

In a world with so many non-sensory and invisible rules, how do we weigh those rules against clear and compellingly pleasant sensations?

The movie also asks, ""What does it mean to say, 'I love you.' ""  Why is it that so many people hesitate to say those words?  What do the words mean?  What do those words limit?  What do those words define?

In one scene, Heidi does something intentionally to hurt herself.  As with anyone who hurts themself, we don't know all the reasons why, but we can probably infer some of the reasons fairly accurately.  And we are sometimes defined by how we respond to those incidents.

This movie is great.  It's worth full attention and consideration.  It's worth repeat viewings.

Toward the end of the film, as Heidi's failures cascade, she takes a walk and glimpses her friend's younger brother, a boy with Asberger's Syndrome, a dysfunction that inhibits empathy - the ability to read and relate to others' visual and verbal emotional signals.  The movie is about learning more about the complexities of relationship bonds, emotional signals, and emotional responsibilities.  It is an epic journey toward improving empathetic aptitudes.  I loved this film.  I'll be saving it and adding it to my scrapbook.",1203552000,5,3677,4.832797427652733
2530519,5,B000ER5NSS,"This movie resonated deeply with me as it will with most females but that's not to say that men cannot enjoy it as well.  It's one of those films that both sexes will like but will view it differently.  It's a haunting film about a 16 year old girl coming to terms with her sexuality and finding her way in life.

We first met Heidi as her mom's boyfriend sends her into the local bar to get her.  Her mom is annoyed when Heidi shows up (a younger version of herself) as she apparently enjoys the company of fellow male patrons more then staying at home.  Abby is annoyed at her mom for the way she acts with other men.  Typical mother/daughter relations when the daughter starts to become a woman.  But Heidi's first attempts at feminine wiles are inappropriate and have dire consequences.  She's devastated by her own actions as well as her mother's reaction and decides to run away.  Abby goes to a resort town where she thinks she can get a job from a guy she met.  He had given her his card and told her to call if she was ever in the area but of course, he did not really mean it and I felt for her when she made this call.  She is stuck in a town with no place to stay and she does the only thing she knows works (me thinks her mom has not been the best role model), let a man have sex with you in exchange for drinks, a place to stay - fill in the blank really.  Heidi is in that very awkward stage between childhood and becoming a woman.  The actress (Abby Cornish) plays her with amazing skill, her whole body language tells the story.  Heidi soon hooks up with Joe (Sam Worthington) who also wants to ""sleep"" with her but she mistakes his backhanded kindness for love and calls every number in the town's phone book until she tracks him down.  He ignores her.  When they run into each other by accident and Joe does not acknowledge her, Heidi's face tells of immense heartbreak that only a teenager in love can experience.  Of course, they end up back in bed but this quasi-relationship is doomed from the start.  Heidi is devastated by the breakup and becomes even more self-destructive and goes back to trolling bars with disturbing consequences.  Joe, of course, walks in at the worst point and things turn nasty.  At this point, Heidi has no self worth and runs after Joe stark naked to no avail.  Her behavior once again has consequences and she is kicked out of her flat.  Heidi becomes spiteful to the one person who showed her true kindness.  She is at a turning point in her life, she can continue her spiral downward or take responsibility for her actions.  This time her walk around town is not filled with childlike curiosity but a more mature introspection.  She returns to thank the woman who helped her before breaking down in tears and telling her the truth of things.  Heidi's mother is called and arranges to come and bring her back home.  The next time she runs into Joe, Heidi handles it with dignity.  She has grown up.  When we see her mother take her back home, there is hope for the future.

The scenes are shot beautifully with great usage of the landscape around them.  The performances were magnificent in their honesty.  This film spoke to the core of my emotions.  It did not require a box of Kleenex although it did leave deep sadness in its wake, a kind of mourning for innocence lost as we reach adulthood and the embarassment over the things we have done as we make our way.",1200096000,23,3418,4.3575949367088604
2530520,4,B000ER5NSS,"I loved this movie because of the up-close, true and real way it shows the main character in this turning point of her life.  It takes a small segment of any person's life and captures it on film, as a way of giving us a new look at ourselves.  The keyword here is that it doesn't ""translate"" it to film; the way the movie conveys itself is natural, like how things progress in real life.  It's not a main stream movie that appeals to mass audiences.  It appeals to you and me, the artistic ones, the thoughful people, the dreamers; those seeking out others' dreams and artistic expressions.  I'm not quite sure how to phrase my next thought, but like other artsy type films I have seen, it isn't a movie for those interested in a straight forward and fast or moderately paced action, drama, romance, or other type of ""regular"" movie.  Art house films like this one don't ""come to you"" so much; with these movies, ""you come to them.""

There are two particular scenes I recall, in this movie, that express Heidi's cursiousity of the world and beauty in everyday things, in a very simple way that touched me and made me feel so wonderful.  (It's hard to describe what I mean without using specifics, but I don't like to give anything away, even little things, about a movie for those who haven't seen it.)  I recommend that you try out this movie, a movie that has so much more meaning and depth than a lot of the mass marketed movies out there.  [Similar movies I have seen include ""November"" and ""Noise"".]  The primary reasons why I give this movie 4 stars and not 5 is because I'm not totally into the ""natural, meandering plot line"" of these types of movies quite as much as others are, and I'm interested in finding a movie that has more scenes like those I described where the main character finds him/herself in a moment of simple curiousity and beauty, like spinning carefree in a field (to use a cliche), against a subtle soundtrack -- the difficult part is, as a director, capturing this hard-to-describe moment on film justly.  This is what this movie does in its own, wonderful way.",1174867200,,2092,4.505291005291006
2530521,2,B000ER5NSS,"This is a movie about how when you try to seduce your mom's sleazy boyfriend, sometimes your mom will catch you and throw you out, and you will  buy a bus ticket to a resort town during offseason and hook up with a simpering, bi-curious ranch-hand.  Then the lady who owns the motel will lament about her imprisoned son and tell you your mom still loves you.

Whatever.  The plot was thin, the acting overdone, the dialog unbelievable.",1170460800,10,435,4.538461538461538
2530522,5,B000ER5NSS,"At its core, this is a very intense and uniquely perceptive psychological drama.  Some would consider it to be a coming-of-age movie because it deals with a teen and sexuality; but I think that is far to shallow analysis.  Indeed, this is not a movie about sexual awakening, or even about a girl trying to use sex to get what she wants.  Notwithstanding what some 'feminists' seem to believe, there is an innate need, a yearning within every normal girl for male attention.  But, it goes much further than that; it is not simply for male attention, but for unselfish, loving male attention that says, 'I love you for the unique, feminine, person you are.'  It is a yearning for mature male ratification of a girl's social person, her intellectual person, her spiritual person as well as for her female physical person.  This whole movie is about Heidi's longing for that kind of love.

It is too easy to say that when Heidi started to kiss her mother's boyfriend that it was somehow due to her sex drive.  The way we see Heidi as the movie progresses, we see that she really has the emotional maturity of about a nine to ten-year old.  Over and over, when she is by herself, we see her fascinated by things that would more interest a grade schooler than a sixteen-year-old; spraying the hose at the gas station window out of frustration is certainly more childish than even adolescent.  So, when she is with her chronological age-mates she has to act a part that she is emotionally to unable to handle.  She knows that well-adjusted adolescents her age are starting to learn to express their sexual love.  Emotionally, she is still a preadolescent, so she is unable to recognize the mature sexual signals.  Therefore, when her mother's boyfriend shows her the slightest attention, she makes a grave emotional error by responding sexually.

A mature man, instead of responding sexually, might have given her a fatherly hug and told her that she was very special, pointing out some of her traits that he saw to be that of a developing fine young lady.  When he didn't respond in the way she really needed, and when her mother freaked out, instead of being a positive event it turned into an emotionally damaging event that left Heidi both bewildered and with a further loss of self-esteem.  Not knowing how to handle the situation, and with no adults in her life who could nudge her toward maturation, she could only think to run away.

So, throughout the movie, she responds to negative situations in ways that make her situation worse, lowering her self esteem even more.  The lower her self esteem becomes, the needier a person she becomes.  To Joe's credit (her perceived boyfriend), as he began to see more into the 'inner Heidi' the more he seemed to realize her emotional immaturity so he became less interested in her sexually as he began to care about her.  Also undoubtedly involved, was his own insecurity about dealing with such serious emotional immaturity.  Finally, during the pivotal scene with Irene, Heidi's mature landlord, she finds someone who recognizes her emotional immaturity and insecurity.  Irene's first action is to help Heidi start to deal with her insecurity - by facing up to what she has done by calling her mother.

My DVD library consists of more than 2,000 DVDs dealing in some way with children and teens, and I cannot think of any of them that surpasses this movie it is perception and presentation of an emotionally hurting teen.  Abbie Cornish's depiction of such a girl is masterful beyond her years.  Not only is she profoundly believable, the story itself is more than just plausible.  You feel as if you are seeing an actual event.

For those who are concerned about such things, there is a bit of coarse language.  However, it is infrequent and just enough to give flavor to the ranching lifestyle.  There are several instances where Heidi's breast are seen, and a couple of scenes where she is totally naked, but curled up to preserve her modesty.  For a few moments she is seen naked outdoors at night from the rear.  One of the young men trying to take advantage of her when she was drunk is seen naked momentarily.  I am grading this movie down a half a rating (so it should be 4-1/2 stars if I could in this forum) because there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for there to be a gayscene, even if it lasts just a couple of seconds.  It would have been far better to use that time showing Joe asking some knowing, mature person how he should behave toward Heidi's problems.

With these caveats in mind, I don't think you can find a more true and believable psychological drama.  In fact, it would be interesting to show this movie to child and teen psychology students and to listen to their discussion.  Lacking that opportunity, I'd say to just watch the movie, enjoy it; but don't neglect to also think about girls you might know who are emotionally immature, like Heidi...",1167868800,11,4926,4.687209302325582
2530523,5,B000ER5NSS,"I heard about this film when I read an interview with it's star, Abbie Cornish, and was so taken on her outlook that I had to check it out. I am certainly glad I did. It is a thought provoking slice of Australian life, showing that misguided youth are essentially the same everywhere. A mesmerizing performance by Ms. Cornish provide the bulk of the five star rating, but well worth a look nonetheless.",1162512000,,402,4.52054794520548
2530524,5,B000ER5NSS,"This chamber movie is an elegant homage to French New wave (Truffaut' s 400 blows). A sweet and alluring beauty teenager discovers the pleasures of the sexuality with the boyfriend of her mother.

That dramatic and painful incident will make she leaves her home and goes to Canberra, and there she will experience in own flesh, how hard is to live. The cold of the loneliness, the hyper rational affective world of the adults, the incisiveness and the visible evasion's thirst of the youth will maintain her in a major level of abandon. In search of her elusive hopes and faked illusions of love, she will grow up fester than the speed of life.

A very sumptuous, poignant and expressive cinematographic gem ,imported from Australia.",1162080000,,733,4.856
2530525,4,B000ER5NSS,"This is a downbeat film that threatens often to turn into tragedy, as a runaway teenager, with the ironically innocent name of Heidi, looks unsuccessfully for a place in the world and in other people's hearts. Loneliness, in fact, seems to prevail as characters reach ineffectually toward each other, often coming away empty-handed.

Shot in winter in the mountains of New South Wales, where local ski resorts provide a tourist economy and a flood of young people looking for fun and casual encounters, the film brings Heidi together with a local boy who has troubles enough of his own and is running away from them with hard drinking. While he eventually rebuffs her overtures of affection, a new friendship with a convenience store co-worker is soured by the girl's father, and a motel manager whose son is doing time rents her a room but proves there are limits to her generosity.

Beautifully filmed, with an effort to capure images of ice, cold nights, snow and fog to represent the isolation of its characters, this movie is a harsh story of the heart's hunger for love and acceptance. As such, it is an adult treatment of that subject and while there is a kind of resolution at the end, the dark undertones of a tragedy averted dominate the final images. The DVD includes a short making-of featurette.",1156204800,6,1308,4.783185840707965
2530526,5,B000ER5NSS,"Living Down Under, Heidi (Abbie Cornish) might be only 16, but she has the body of an older woman.  Lonely and struggling to deal with new feelings, she makes a pass at her mother's tattooed boyfriend.  He of course reciprocates, but they are caught by her mother (Olivia Pigeot)), who totally freaks.  Rejected by her mother, a shattered Heidi runs away from home.  Because she is willing to trade her body for a place to stay and transportation, things are not looking promising for Heidi.  Then she has a bit of lucky, because she crosses the path of Joe (Sam Worthington), the son of a farmer, who is drawn to the nymph but is not interested in taking advantage of her.

So when she gets in his pickup he takes her to this ski resort town, which is not in the off-season, and there she tries to make a life for herself.  Joe puts her up for the night in a motel run by Irene (Lynette Curran), who is willing to let Heidi stay in the flat behind the place that her son used to stay in as long as she pays rent and does not cause trouble.  Heidi scours the town for a job at gets one working behind the counter at the BP station.  She is way too needy for Joe, who has his own problems, but he sees her from time to time until she asks him if he is her boyfriend.  He does not respond well to pressure and perhaps he is put off by her trashy background.  In fact, that seems to be what most of the people in this town think about her, which is brought home in a scene that is representative of the tenor of this film.

At several key moments in ""Somersault,"" the film does exactly that.  You think you know what is about to happen when Heidi is being given a ride and the guy suddenly turns off the road to show her something; but the expected does not happen.  You think that Heidi is forming the nucleus of a new family, but that is not what is happening here either.  What should have been a friendship with Bianca (Hollie Andrew) at the BP, is quickly denied her.  Even when we get to the pivotal moment where a depressed and despondent Heidi decides to become the person that apparently everybody think she is, things do not pan out as we would think either.  It is this ability to surprise me time and time again that fully justifies rounding up on this 2004 film.

This is a heartfelt and painful movie, because Heidi is living on the edge, and obviously mistaken sex for love.  We have trouble thinking she is still a little girl, but we never believe she has become a woman.  In her favor is the fact that she is trying to make an honest go of it out on her own.  I was expecting her to start stealing things, but she does not, although she scavenges left over food at the motel.  In fact, one of the signature aspects of her character is that she eats whatever she can at every opportunity.  Heidi is so emotionally numb that that what stands out are the two moments where she loses it.  The first comes when she learns of a cruel lie that adds insult to injury and forces a primal scream of rage out of her.  The other is when she finally breaks and confesses to another person as to what has happened to her, and in that honest moment finds the lifeline she so desperately needs.

""Somersault"" is the first feature film by writer-director Cate Shortland, who had previously made a trio of short films.  There are some artistic flourishes throughout the film and a strategic reduction in the color palate, but primarily Shortland has her cinematographer Robert Humphreys go with a hand held camera to create a sense of intimacy with the characters.  The results are quite successful.  ""Somersault"" won 13 Australian Film Institute awards out of 15 nominations (the previous record for wins was 8), with the two it did not win being because it had multiple nominees in the supporting actor and actress categories.  Obviously there is a lot of pressure on Shortland for her new film, which I should think they are eagerly anticipating in Australia, but she appears to be biding her time.  That reminds me: whatever happened to James Cameron?",1154649600,45,4052,4.377005347593583
8113499,4,B000ER5NSS,"Young sensual confused run-a-way in her late teens. Very slow film..., Australian... but visually lovely location and somehow the pace of the film is what draws you in.  You could say this film didn't have a point really but it did have a story that could have been very true easily. It's a saga of her journey, her vulnerable youth, openness, trust, sensual/sexual nature and desire to be loved and to feel safe; also her hurt, guilt and confusion..., and the kindness of strangers; of first love and ultimately a mother's love.

Note to conservatives and parents: nudity, sex and drunkenness in this; fair warming.
