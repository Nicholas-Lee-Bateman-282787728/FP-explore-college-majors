4507728,2,B004ZBFQ04,"I started watching this series, but I only lasted maybe 3 episodes. It's really boring, and not what I expected. I like Sarah Palin, but all they do is fish, hunt, hike, water rafting, and other outdoors stuff. I would not recommend SARAH PALIN'S ALASKA!!!",1294531200,6,256,4.711111111111111
4507729,5,B004ZBFQ04,"The woman the media loves to hate just keeps the hits coming.

People who disagree with her views might get annoyed by the occasional political jabs, but for most this is enjoyable and educational viewing. The scenery is incredible and steals the show in many episodes. The Gosselin episode is a must see. Chuck and Becker are a 'been-there done-that' type of Dynamic Duo.

There is quite the cast of characters to choose from in Alaska, and seeing the remote lifestyles of some of these residents and the lives they live just to get by another day or season really presents a stark contrast to urban life of the lower 48's cities and suburbs.

Sarah Palin is the real deal. The media has smeared her mercilessly and portrayed her as someone to be dismissed as a joke, but this woman has fought corruption on both sides of the aisle and proven her detractors wrong time after time. This is one amazing lady. I hope there is a season 2 - but not if it interferes with her running in 2012!",1294012800,32,987,4.472222222222222
4507730,2,B004ZBFQ04,"Ex-governor-of-Alaska Sarah Palin is pretty well-known to everybody in the United States, and it's hard to find anybody who doesn't have a strong opinion on her.

So it shouldn't have surprised anyone that Palin and her clan have now entered the world of reality TV with ""Sarah Palin's Alaska."" It is fascination when it reveals some little-known facts about the coldest, largest state in the country, but it also feels like a giant commercial for Palin and her political career.

We follow Palin, her husband, and her five kids (plus her grandson) as they go on expeditions across Alaska. They do shooting, recreational fishing, professional fishing with her soldier-turned-fisherman son Track, caribou hunting, fish camps, mountain climbing, dog-sledding, logging, RVing and camping with legendary reality-TV harridan Kate Gosselin and her kids.

The most entertaining aspects of ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" lie in the travelogue parts -- I know next to nothing about Alaska, so it's fascinating to get glimpses into the epic scenery, the remote wildness, and the way of life. While it doesn't encompass the full scope of Alaskan life (I presume there are some city-dwellers up there), it is fascinating to see how they live, such as the fishing camp where fish are caught and smoked the traditional Inuit way.

What did I not like? The rest of the show. Reality TV is the bottom of the multimedia barrel, and 99% of the reality stars are not taken seriously. A politician with a reality TV show? This doesn't really translate into votes.

And honestly, I often felt like I was watching an hourlong political commercial, from the inspiring country-western theme song to the photo-ops of Palin. There's a lot of emphasis on her image of a huntin'-fishin'-shootin' outdoorswoman, and we're constantly hammered with platitudes about family and togetherness. It feels like Palin is trying to convince the American people that she's the Alaskan Theodore Roosevelt.

Even putting aside the political aspects of ""Sarah Palin's Alaska,"" this series fails because... it's boring. The parts that focus on the Palin family's minor troubles and activities are just DULL, since there is no conflict or any real problems beyond friendly bickering. Oh, and one of the daughters sneaking a boy into her bedroom -- that was the first and last time they did something interesting.

""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" is at its most interesting when it focuses on just that -- Alaska. When the focus switches to Sarah Palin, interest levels crash like poll numbers.",1293926400,4,2531,5.128640776699029
4507731,5,B004ZBFQ04,"I happen to love this show! It shows the beauty of Alaska, along with Sarah raising her kids at the same time. AShe is a real trooper and this show shows it. I hope this show lasts more than just 8 episodes!",1293667200,58,207,3.9523809523809526

4507745,5,B004ZBFQ04,"Sarah Palin is the very ESSENCE of a healthy person. When she came onto the national stage the Liberals immediately recognized her as a threat to everything they stood for. True, she was very physically attractive, but she was also very accomplished. Liberals like to claim they ""speak truth to power""; she had already spoken truth to power by standing up to the corrupt leaders of her own (Republican) party and defeated them  first locally and then statewide. Once in power, she forced corrupt oil companies to the table and renegotiated their contracts so that Alaska's natural resources would be positively exploited for the benefit of the CITIZENS of Alaska, and not only for the shareholders of the oil companies.

But she did this as a pro-life conservative Christian while raising a family of five children and keeping her husband very happy in the process. And Liberals can't stand attractive, accomplished women who aren't pro-abortion and pro-big government. They saw her as a threat, so they believed they had to destroy her.
After they vindictively destroyed the McCain/Palin campaign and sent her back to Alaska, they proceeded to try to financially ruin her family by filing frivolous lawsuits. Defending her official choices came out of her pocket, not the State's coffers. The frivolous lawsuits  ALL false  became such a financial strain and political distraction that she could no longer do her job as governor. So she resigned half way through her first term.

The Liberals cackled with glee that they had finally defeated her. They had not. This video series was shot after she was drummed out of office. These episodes show the beauty of Alaska and the cheerful productivity of Alaska's people. And they show Sarah enjoying life to the hilt! We not only get to see the natural beauty of Alaska, but we experience the essence of a normal, healthy family in the process. You might purchase this series to explore Alaska  and it DOES do that  but, in the process of getting to know the lay of the land, you will get to see what family life SHOULD be like. Buy this series!",1359590400,2,2091,4.856741573033708

4507750,5,B004ZBFQ04,"This is a great show.  Geez!  What do you want?  I guess you can make this as complicated as you want to, but for me....this was as simple as it gets. Beautiful photography, good music, and a basic overall message of hope and inspiration.  If you don't get that from this series, you need to move to a Gulag in Russia for a while or something.

We are blessed with an amazing country, fantastic resources, and beautiful people.  If you concentrate on the negative, you will see it....everywhere. But if you look for hope......if you look towards the future.....if you believe in good......then this series is easy to watch. It is a joy to behold.

Good grief people...relax!  Why worry so much?  She is not even running, yet you hate her?  She has an opinion, sure. But then again, so do you. Who is really more qualified? Who has...and is...doing it?....living it as we speak? And who is in an old apartment building somewhere in Cleveland, complaining about Sarah Palin?  IDIOTS!

When will YOU ever go to those places? Never!!!  So enjoy the front row seat to some of the most spectacular film you could ever hope to see. Sarah is an awesome host.  I would be proud if I knew as much about my state as she does about hers.

I think she would be a much more trustworthy President than the man who is in there now. She has a family value system that is strong and happy.  She is NOT going to her Rev Wright, or anyone else like him. She communes with Mother Nature.....and her family. Wow...I love her for that!

Its because its just not that good.  Insert washed up celebrity trying to reinvent self.  Welcome to reality shows.  Watching this moronic family is no more enjoyable than watching Ozzy stutter every other word or having Gene Simmons try to sell KISS on Family Jewels.  If your a fan of this airhead you will like the show.  It does show the pretty areas of Alaska.

4507760,5,B004ZBFQ04,"I had not seen this when it aired on TV, so I was happy to see it went to DVD.
No matter how you feel about the Palin family, do watch this for all the beautiful footage of Alaska. This was NOT one of those odd TV family reality shows. Little time was spent inside the Palin home. You were on the road more, learning about Alaska, visiting many places throughout the state, and observing the wildlife. So well put together that you will feel you are right there in Alaska visiting. Not a home movie, amazing beautiful camera work and music.

Now keep in mind many vegetarians would have a hard time watching this. Yes, animals do get killed. I'm a vegetarian and love animals and I had to skipped over the meat scenes. It is a way of life that many city folk may not understand.

I enjoyed the Palin bunch and at times they were quite funny. Sarah's Dad is a really trooper and so young at heart. He was a delightful addition to this series.
I have to give this a 5 star rating, as I really found it to be very well done and so very interesting. This is a wonderful way to feel like you went on a great Alaskan journey!",1308355200,18,1119,4.152073732718894
4507761,5,B004ZBFQ04,"Sarah Palin has a wonderful presentation of the way we live in Alaska. Good movie. Better than dramatic soaps for sure. This is living. Her life is similar to mine, her children are perfectly imperfect...like mine. Watching this kinda feels like she was here visiting, sharing a home video. Good production. Good quality.",1305244800,12,321,5.0754716981132075
4507762,5,B004ZBFQ04,"One of the most exciting DVD's. Rosie the Riveter, for sure.  I was expecting to see the beauty of Alaska's splendor, but what I got out of this film was much more.

This program was enriched with:  family values, work ethics, ""we're in it together,"" respect, do what it takes to get the job done, those teaching moments, appreciating other people's work ethics, stretch one's self, allow for individuality, but at the same time, do what is expected, set the example, be diplomatic, savor the moment, honor and include extended family, be fit, push yourself to the limit, don't make a mountain out of a mole hill, every child is a blessing from above, your actions become your character, balance, comradeship, learn something new, make the most out of life, appreciate people's abilities, remember where you came from and who you are.

One didn't see: co-dependency, anxiety, disrespectfulness, pride, laziness, alienation, wall flowers, machismo, trying to outdo one another, incivility, inpudence, shaming one another, being one-sided, having a quitting attitude.

This show exceeded my expectations.  Thanks for giving us a glimpse of your world, Palins.  Mr. & Mrs Palin, I dig your relationship. It rocks. Great job TLC!  I bet you had a hard time keeping up with the Palin's stamina--every one of them.  This show ought to be shown in the school system.",1305244800,9,1359,5.03125

4507764,5,B004ZBFQ04,Great entertainment!!  Demonstrated Alaska to be an even more beautiful state than previously known.  The Palins introduced viewers to a wonderful variety of people who live and work there.  All led interesting lifestyles and some were very unique characters within spectacular surroundings. Makes me want to go there and see more.  Been there once but only to Anchorage for a short time.  Must go again,1304899200,12,403,5.138461538461539
4507765,5,B004ZBFQ04,"I watched one episode of this miniseries while on a trip from my hotel room, I got to see Sarah bag a caribou. Since then, I resolved to buy the DVDs when they came out.

I would say the early episodes are best, you see real Alaska and real Alaskans, going about their lifestyles. And it's all about hard work, not like those city slickers from (as they call it) the 'lower 48'.

For those wondering why there are no DVD extras listed, this is deceptive. The final 'episode' gives bloopers, outtakes, and reactions to filming the previous episodes. For instance, we meet the Alaska Fish and Wildlife man whose job it is to sit atop a platform on the river's mouth, counting salmon. Not exciting enough for the regular episodes, but all of this is interesting for those who have never seen Alaska.

Todd Palin is a man of few words, but that's okay, he works. He has worked the BP oil shale on the northern slopes, and fished all day and night to haul in the catch that provides for his family. The Palins have a very lovely home, but it was all paid for through Todd and Sarah's hard work. (Their home was not paid for by Chicago graft, payoffs and kickbacks that would make Tony Soprano blush in shame. That would be another First Family, the one that is above media criticism, examination, or ridicule, hint hint.)

Sarah's enthusiasm for her activities sounds a bit forced at times, but guess what, she's a real person, not a media figure. I enjoyed scenes like her serving Alaskans at one of her favorite diners (excellent pies made there), or just dealing with her fear of heights scaling a glacial rock.

For those wondering if these episodes are pure profit for Sarah Plain, you betcha. The legal costs racked up while in office from frivolous lawsuits need to be paid off, and Sarah doesn't demand the taxpayer pay for the cost of fame. In that, she is nobler than most of her colleagues, few of whom have accomplished as much as she has.

This DVD shows the best of America, and what the independent spirit of hard work can achieve. Way to go Sarah, and the rest of the Palins!",1303776000,8,2086,4.4619422572178475
4507766,1,B004ZBFQ04,"What a mind numbing awful show.  If my television didn't have the luxury of having a mute button, Sarah Palin's Alaska would deserve zero stars.  Besides endless rambling on and on, Ms Palin always look puzzled when staring at the snow, like she seeing it for the first time.  I would have found the show more creditable and entertaining if the Discovery Channel would have dropped the Ozzie Osborne's family in the middle of Alaska wilderness.  At least the burned out rocker can speak in complete sentences.",1303603200,23,509,4.816091954022989
4507767,5,B004ZBFQ04,"One suspects that if Sarah Palin had never become a national political figure, ""Sarah Palin's Alaska"" would still be a fascinating and appealing bit of television. The TV series provided a window into a way of life that many people, particularly big city dwellers, are unfamilier with. It was devoid of a lot of the dysfunctionality that one endures in other shows of this kind. Also a number of episodes (the hunting caribou one for example) had the virtue of really annoying the sorts of people who need to be annoyed and often. Highly recommended for family viewing.",1301961600,9,569,4.816326530612245
4507768,1,B004ZBFQ04,A more successful travelogue would not have included such a divisive character as hostess. This show merely masquerades as a travelogue. Sarah Palin invites such bitter dispute as to cloud over the main theme of traveling through Alaska. I seriously doubt an exgovernor's family as representing the majority of Alaskan lifestyles. A cameo introduction would have been enough to keep her name on the title.,1301875200,18,405,5.246153846153846
4507769,5,B004ZBFQ04,This is a wonderful documentary about Alaska and the Palin family. If you like Sarah Palin you will not be disappointed. If you hate Sarah Palin and open minded you will learn something about Alaska and perhaps will hate Sarah a little less.,1301788800,5,241,4.627906976744186

They TRY to pretend they went it to watching the show with an open mind but CLEARLY that isn't the case as they start calling Sarah stupid right from the start.  First off, Sarah CLEARLY is not stupid.  She's an intelligent, articulate woman who inspires many. Someone may disagree with her politics but there is nothing on the show that makes her in anyway come off stupid.  Honestly to me, when people say that she's stupid it only makes them sound hateful.  For some reason all the people who call her stupid never seem to say why she's stupid - just that she is.  Let's be honest, it's Sarah's politics they disagree with.

As for the show, it was beautiful.  The photography was amazing showing off a lot of what makes Alaska so beautiful.  The Palin family come off as a family that cares about each other.  Again if you hate Sarah then you'll hate the show and will look for ANYTHING to prove that you are right and the show is bad - that is if you hate Sarah (*actually her politics.)  As for me and my family?  We loved the show, looked forward to watching it AS A FAMILY (*how many clean shows for families are out there anyway?) and can't wait to buy the DVD!",1298332800,11,1220,4.302631578947368

4507779,5,B004ZBFQ04,"This 8-episode series does a masterful job of demonstrating that an average American family can have the absolute best time of their life in Alaska!
  Ignore all political biases - and be Fair.  This ""Travel"" series, from a ""Family"" perspective, illustrates how much fun, fulfillment, enjoyment and challenges that any family, of any mental or physical skill level can get so much of from Alaska.  The journey to Alaska and cost may be prohibitive for many people, but there are many things beyond compare to the ""lower 48"" that can be everyday events in any Alaska adventure.
  Simple walks, hikes or drives will be the most unforgetful journeys of a lifetime for anyone who has even the slightest interest in Nature.  Sarah and her family demonstrate this in a peaceful, genuine, down-to-earth level.  I wish I was part of that family.
  This is one of the best ""Travel"" series I've ever seen in my life...  and I've seen them all!
  Sarah was the centerpiece of this series, and sometimes the footage downplays the family interactions in the interest of time or showing more nature activities...  but the interactions that are shown are true and not shaped for television.",1296432000,27,1175,4.8686868686868685
4507780,5,B004ZBFQ04,"I must start off by saying that the only reason I initially turned on the show in the first place was b/c I was hoping for good ""entertainment"" and that it'd be a fun show to make fun of. But during the second episode I watched, I began to develop a soft spot for Sarah and her family and her gorgeous state. Although I don't necessarily agree with Palin on the topic of politics,  I still like her as a human being. This show does a great job of showing her amazing home state of Alaska and definitely makes me want to go there some day. In each episode, she goes on some sort of wilderness adventure with her family. I think the world would be a better place if all families did fun things like that together. I encourage you to watch the show with an open heart and an open mind.",1295654400,71,782,4.111111111111111
4507781,1,B004ZBFQ04,"Sarah Palin's Alaska is a mercifully short-lived series that failed to maintain its time slot and is being promoted as a video in a desperate attempt to cover its costs before TLC puts it in the ""What were we thinking"" file.

It presents a positive image of the state of Alaska but could have benefited from professional writing, directing, editing, special effects, and makeup artists.  Vocal and acting lessons would have improved it significantly.  Professionals who had an eye for Ms Palin's best interests could have presented her in a positive light which could only have been beneficial to her career goals, if she ever has any.

People who are concerned for children's education and wellbeing can comfort themselves with the knowledge that reality tv is always fake, although, even being fake, it shows her children behaving poorly and Ms. Palin avoiding commonsense safety precautions and ignoring her daughter cheating on her homework.  This is not quite as charming as Ms. Palin evidently believes. Possibly her fans can relate, however.

Kate Gosselin and brood make a brief appearance in one episode, to the great pleasure of their fans. Kate shows surprising good sense when she realizes that the Palins are completely inexperienced in the wild and have not given her appropriate instructions on what to wear and what to expect.  Sensibly, she gathers her children and leaves.... demonstrating actual concern for her children's safety.  Even though Sarah Palin assures Ms Gosselin that she, Sarah, would protect her, Kate evidently had advance warning about the upcoming ""hunting"" episode in which Sarah fails to take down a stationary caribou after six shots and a caribou is finally shot by somebody in order to make her look better, although here special effects would have come in handy, as it's clear that Sarah did not make the successful shot.  Alaskans should be annoyed by the waste of caribou meat in violation of state hunting laws as the Palins jump in joy, brag about themselves and butcher out only a few pounds of meat while leaving a bloody carcass for scavengers... having spent $42,000 in a failed effort to prove that they know something about hunting.  Hunters, again, can comfort themselves with the fact that only one caribou was wasted as reality TV is always fake and clearly the Palins do not ever hunt. Or shoot. Or camp. Or pan gold. Or visit relatives.

This DVD series is highly recommended for people with more money than brains, taste, or judgment.",1295222400,26,2493,4.983132530120482
4507782,5,B004ZBFQ04,"Although I was raised in a conservative Christian family and my mother adores Sarah Palin, I was not a huge fan of hers. I share her values, but I am not persuaded that she has the legal and political skill and prowess; she would be another W. at best.

That said, this show is not about her political campaigns. It's about the human being that is Sarah Palin taking a number of exciting outdoor adventures in Alaska. Some of these adventures, such as fishing and hunting, are routine for Sarah. Some of them were clearly scheduled for the show as a new, fresh adventure that Sarah hadn't experienced much or at all before.

That Sarah is a politician is not completely lost in this show; she makes a number of comments about her career as a politician, and we see her taking on television and radio interviews from time to time as well as making the rounds with the locals making political friends. And as she narrates the show (this is her show, after all), it's a no-brainer expectation that she would regularly try to use rhetoric about her adventures in Alaska as analogous to her political career. But really this stuff takes a back seat--way back seat. You come away from this show seeing Ms Palin as Wonder Woman (one of her friends on the show calls her ""Amazon Woman'), not so much ""governor"", ""vice-president"", or some other officer of the state or United States. (On the other hand, isn't that just the sort of material America needs in office? Less white collar, more blood, sweat, and tears... That's definitely the message Sarah and her followers want portrayed by this show.)

And actually, the show proves less about Sarah than about her kids. Say what you will about their family (the term ""idiots"" has been used in these reviews, and I'm willing to bet that such reviewers were not so bright in their youth either), these people are real and down-to-earth, and while one would expect them to be seriously affected for better or for worse by Sarah's publicity, and they certainly aren't unaffected, they still seem, in my opinion, true to who they are. They're not idiots, they're people. One of Sarah's kids is retarded; you really feel like you're getting a transparent view of a vulnerable home, and I appreciate that glimpse.

The adventures that they have are quite interesting, if indeed one finds fishing, hunting, panning for gold, kayaking, and other great Alaskan adventures to be interesting. If not, skip, there's too much of it. But the adventures definitely give a picturesque view of Alaska, and this show is amazingly gorgeous in high definition.
