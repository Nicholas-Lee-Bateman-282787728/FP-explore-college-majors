186614,5,156580211X,"""Jeanne la Pucelle 1. Les Batailles[Joan the Maid: the Battles]"" begins with Joan's efforts to obtain permission to see the Dauphin in Chinon and ends with his coronation. It starts off badly with an actress hamming it up as the Mother of Joan and telling what a perfect child she was. Most of the early scenes come directly from the rehabilitation hearings where she was portrayed as a faultless saint in keeping with the newly restored French government. Many of the actors in this beginning section seem to pose and speak directly to the camera rather than to each other like they were in a tableau or an elementary school Passion play. It may have been deliberate, but it didn't work for me. What did work was the great attention to detail and the settings. Jacques Rivette went out of his way to stay with documented facts and to take advantage of the true French landmarks and countryside. I loved the way he played each scene out regardless of what happened with the horses, props, or men, letting the accidents happen as part of the action. ""Jeanne la Pucelle 2. Les prisons[Joan the Maid: the Prisons]"" stayed with documented facts, using a fade-to-black after every scene, to give a flawless view of Joan and the people she encountered. Sandrine Bonnaire was outstanding in every respect. Her interpretation of Joan did honor to both the warrior saint and the human girl caught up in a tragedy. The prison and trial sequences worked in every respect because the director did not do more than let each character speak his or her mind. I especially loved the early prison sequences where Rivette contrasted the world of women with the world of men, again, giving each character a full and believable voice. It is the best historical treatment I have seen in a long time and by far the best Joan.",998784000,14,1803,4.690851735015773
186615,4,156580211X,"This long 1993 French film sacrifices spectacle (and a star from my rating) in favor of an accurate and engaging character study of Joan of Arc (Jeanne la Pucelle).  The low-budget look  nullifies the impact of the  battle sequences, alas, but apart from that this two-part movie (edited  from the original six hours, also unfortunately) is convincing and shows  commendable restraint.  Unlike flashier, less historical depictions, it is  free of bombast and invention and Sandrine Bonnaire's Joan is direct,  pious, and believeable.  The dialog is refreshingly free of awkward  anachronisms and makes good use of Joan's own words as recorded by  historians and court transcripts.  The pacing could be snappier, and the  edits are annoying to those of us who wanted to see the complete film, but  this is a faithful and moving story that is mainly well-told.  Note:  the  two copies that I have seen have BOTH had the labels reversed on the  cassettes, so don't watch the second tape first!",951696000,10,990,5.006172839506172
186616,5,156580211X,"In the November 15th, 1999 issue of ""The New Yorker,"" Joan Acocella called Rivette's ""Joan the Maid"" ""the best Joan of Arc movie ever made."" I couldn't agree with her more. It's also the  most historically accurate. The scenes and dialogue are taken practically  word for word from primary source accounts made by Joan of Arc's  contemporaries. Unlike Hollywood's big-budget Joan of Arc epics, Rivette's  film is modestly low-budget, but its simplicity makes it all the more  charming. It focuses more on the character of this extraordinary 15th  century young woman rather than on the big battle spectacles. As  ""Sight and Sound"" magazine put it, ""Rivette takes us not  onto the stage of history but backstage -- to its green room."" I found  Sandrine Bonnaire's portrayal of Joan especially moving. Most portrayals of  her fail what I call the essential ""leadership test."" (Would  anyone follow Milla Jovovich's bug-eyed Joan of Arc into battle? We'd  sooner put her in a padded cell.) However, Sandrine Bonnaire portrays an  intelligent, confident young woman that anyone would follow. She charms the  viewer as much as the real Joan charmed her countrymen.",945993600,16,1159,5.128342245989304
7796486,5,156580211X,"This film is closely based on the historical record, and the action takes place in real time -- very slowly, for modern sensibilities -- and without sensationalism, giving viewers a good sense of the time and culture.  Sandrine Bonnaire is amazing as Joan.",1398729600,,256,4.953488372093023

7796488,5,156580211X,"Jeanne La Pucelle,Part 1-The Battles,Part 2 (The Prisons) is a major attempt to strip away the hype of other interpretations,the rhetoric of religion,the miracles of mythology,to present her as a down-to-earth teenage farmgirl,who hears voices of saints from God telling her to save France from the English and to see the dauphin crowned as King of France. Bonnaire can be stern with her men,pull them up when they blaspheme or are ill-disciplined. She can be giggly when her hair is cut and like an immature girl when she is hit by an arrow,crying and vulnerable. There are no close-ups,which is a feature of Rivette's cinema. The film captures well the ebb and flow of sympathy of the soldiers around her,the way they almost hero worship her and become courageous when she is present,flyng the standard,rallying the troops. Rivette respects Dreyers and Bresson's versions and presents a companion piece. This has the realism of medieval reportage rather than costume drama.

Rivette shows a mastery of period detail and dramatic pacing,somehow avoiding cliche s or pitfalls. Bonnaire's performance is compelling and credible. She makes you believe this illiterate peasant teenager could penetrate the sycophantic supporters around the dauphin and make him believe that divine voices would inspire her to victory over the occupying English and that she could be discarded by supporters so easily and persecuted so viciously by her ecclesiastical and military foes. In Bonnaire's portrayal Jeanne has quietness,dignity,but is self assured to lead men into battle. She suggests doubt in private moments about what direction to take. The 1st part is primarily concerned with battles of words rather than battles with armies to convince various men,a captain to provide an escort,the dauphin to trust her,holy men to accept that she is good,armies' leaders to follow her advice. Rivette shows a bleak world without adornment,Joan is worldly,peasant-faced.

She is confronted by worldly barriers,physical problems. Rivette grounds the film in a world of simple routines, budgets,provisions. Earthy human details,sexuality,are not passed over,debunking the myth,what her men think ofher, then are ashamed of afterwards. Rivette does everything with sly humour to prick solemnity,emphasising the silly, the profane and the ordinary,rather than the mystical. We see this well in La Hire(Boucher)with hisprofanity and private prayers to God like he's another guy. We are not banged over the head by the spiritual,but it isquietly there. The landscapes are beautiful,foggy,hazy,with muted colours,gently undulating. The bare,desolate walls of sacked castles,stripped by the English. There is a great variety of settings, movement and pace to match. There's a natural grace to the imagery, a concentration on the details and small moments around the big events,the trial and her martyrdom. Rivette uses all his subtlety and nuance to reveal Joan's humanity, and as he always is good with actresses, gets Bonnaire's best ever performance. Marvellous. See this with Dreyer's version for best results.",1375315200,,3088,5.512658227848101
7796489,5,156580211X,"I own both versions and can enthusiastically recommend both.  I prefer the shorter version offered here.  The subtitles are better, the film quality is a lot better in the second half of the movie, and the edits actually make the movie more enjoyable after repeated viewings.",1295395200,3,275,4.956521739130435
7796490,5,156580211X,"There is not much I can add to the prvious reviews.  There is a lot of ""good stuff"" in them.  I give the movie "" 5 "" stars overall because it is certainly my favorite.  However, it does have a few flaws, like the captions being a bit off. I agree the movie deserves better.  It helps to understand French when watching it but I realize that many do not and that is why the captions need to be improved.  Even though Sandrine Bonnaire is a bit older than the Joan of Arc she plays I do not see that as an obvious flaw.  I truly love the beautiful and honest simplicty of this film.  Jeanne D'Arc is my patron saint since childhood.",1290556800,,630,4.073170731707317
7796491,5,156580211X,"Sandrine Bonnaire was 29 years old when she gave us this Joan; the historical Joan was 16 and 17 during the main action of the film. It is worth considering how the actress convincingly resolves the discrepancy. On a technical level, she adjusts her vocal register. That aside, she interprets Joan as an ""old soul""--old, that is, beyond the lengthiest of human lifespans.

But then, don't we already know Bonnaire as just such an ""old soul?"" This is the same actor who, at age 15, struck us with terror as she waded, fully possessed of adult sensuality, into the perils of adolescence in A NOS AMOURS. And, at 17 in VAGABOND, she was already world-weary almost beyond our ability to watch.

So, she comes to JOAN THE MAID with her filmography in tow. We believe her now because we believed so much in her maturity when she really was Joan's age. Her Joan doesn't have a bit of the simple peasant girl about her. Girl, yes, but never simple. At times, she interprets Joan as a heroine in a Bernanos novel (one of those is in her filmography), and in that regard draws from the stillness of a Bresson ""model,"" remembering that Bresson filmed Bernanos twice and did his own version of Joan. But she doesn't HOLD still. She hits all the notes as, one moment, she rides fiercely into battle, and the next, pauses to pray for the fallen English.

How fortunate to have one of the finest living actresses under the direction of such an ardent admirer of women as Jacques Rivette! Why else would Rivette, a man not conspicuously given to either religiosity or nationalism, take on THIS story? Do my eyes deceive me, or is that Rivette himself who, in priestly garb, exorcizes Joan on behalf of Robert de Baudricourt? If so, how apt symbolically that he would be the one to legitimize the journey that would show the world the most remarkable woman of the Middle Ages.

Even in the truncated version on offer here, the only possible rivals for ""best Joan"" are Dreyer's and Bresson's. Those may be more ""transcendental,"" whatever that means. But, for sheer variety of performance, this one gets my vote.",1183248000,3,2093,4.648648648648648

7796493,5,156580211X,"Seeing myself as a kind of Randian ""romantic realist"" as far as movies are concerned, I was initially reluctant to purchase a copy of Rivette's rather naturalistic ""Joan the Maid"", all the more so as I would not rank Sandrine Bonnaire among the prettier French actresses I know of, and I was a bit afraid of the director's potentially anti-Catholic approach, given his track record. However, watching the movie right after reading Regine Pernoud's well-documented 1986 biography of Jeanne, which served as one of the sources for the scenario, I was impressed by the writers and the director's concern with historical accuracy, within the limits, of course, of a minuscule budget rendering a realistic recreation of the battles impossible (do not expect to see more than a few dozen men at once on screen, if that.) The only blatant error I did notice based on my very meager but relatively fresh knowledge of Jeanne's life was that Rivette has her wear her battle armour during the coronation scene, while Pernoud suggests she was wearing rich women's clothes, about which the then archbishop of Chartres even said she had been a little vain (I missed the opportunity for characterization more than the dress, though.)

Bonnaire is perfect as Jeanne, wonderfully capturing her endearing sense of humour and her paradoxically no-nonsense approach to life, whether on Earth or in Heaven. Her self-effacing impersonation of the Maid (she is an actress, not a celebrity) makes her beautiful even if she is not. She actually feels like the person that transpires through the first-hand documents, unlike Besson's psychotic, comic-book top-model, or Lelee Sobieski's moody American teenager. Moreover, her surroundings actually look like France (because they are), unlike the Disneyland of the Duguay movie.

My only reservations are with the DVD edition of this film. First, it appears that we are not presented with a full-length version : ""The Battles"", which should be 160', is only 112' long, while ""The Prisons"" is 116' instead of 176, which means a total of 108 minutes are missing, the length of an ordinary movie (I know that more is not necessarily better, but given the rather undramatic construction of the film, it might well be in the present case.) Second, the edition is not enhanced for 16/9 screens, so that I actually had to reduce the size of the image to make it look less grainy. Third, the subtitles cannot be removed (which is frustrating if you understand French) and are not always reliable (I did not read them systematically, but I found quite a few egregious errors.) And finally, the supplements are virtually non-existent and the chronology of Jeanne's life contains a few errors of spelling (""Domrmy"", her village, becomes a more musical ""Dormy"" for instance.)

I would not recommend this movie to anybody with a teenage mentality, measuring the greatness of a movie in terms of the hormonal discharges it produces. I am afraid Joan the Maid is not the kind of stimulus that activates viewers' endocrine systems. People under thirty-five should therefore abstain. But if you really want to get a sense of the historical Jeanne, or Jehanne as she spelled it, and can survive 90 minutes without any battle in a movie called ""The Battles"", then this film is for you. Jeanne does not run on walls, make any fancy moves with her sword or even kill anyone (like the real Jeanne), but at least she lives.",1094083200,23,3423,4.970331588132635
7796494,4,156580211X,"What is striking about any Rivette film is the intimacy of his style. The way the film is cut emphasizes that we are just eavesdropping in on select scenes. And the scenes chosen say a lot about what Rivettes intentions are. He is less interested in scenes that tell us about history and more interested in scenes which tell us about character. The story is familiar to us all so that is a great advantage to him and allows him to forego the obvious scenes full of historical significance for the intimate telling ones.  Rivette's Joan wins over anyone who comes in contact with her but the way Sandrine Bonnaire plays her its her warm and genuine nature that wins them over moreso than her ""visions"" and ideas of destiny. And this is the Joan that Rivette is interested in. What quality she has that no one else does is her naturalness and of course thats what Bonnaire too is known for, her earthy outdoor demeanor. Those who befriend Joan admire her convictions and her purity but more than anything they like her. And those figures of authority who feel threatened by her utter sincerity are those who are themselves lacking that quality. I think its impossible to say one portrayal of Joan of Arc is more accurate than another, there are just different interpretations of what this girl was like.  Rivette purposely avoids creating yet another mythic version of her and chooses instead to show her as a person. Rivette shows that the men that fought beside her had great affection for her. Some of the men believed in her calling, some didn't, but they all admired her beauty and her bravery. She herself did not do much more than wave a banner but she proved to be just the right kind of muse--her simple earthy presence won the men over. I think this is an interesting take on the Joan of Arc character but more to the point what is most interesting is not the history telling be it accurate or not but Rivettes unique way of storytelling which emphasizes the incidental over the episodic. A more subtle form of revisionist history you will not find.",1045267200,4,2057,4.586956521739131
7796495,4,156580211X,"Joan the Maid is the clearest and least judgmental version available.  It is also the least Hollywood version.  The screenplay is a straighforward, chronological narrative, and Rivette gives us a series of tableaux along the lines of a medieval passion play.  The abrupt blackouts are a little distracting, but the scenes themselves are beautifully played and shot.  Joan is  a challenge to any actress - the audience all have ideas about her already.  Leelee Sobieski is the credible teenager; Ingrid Bergman the classic heroine.  Sandrine Bonnaire's girlish behavior sometimes seems out of place - too casual for divine inspiration - but her very human reactions to events, particularly to her first battle, are moving.  The simplicity with which she pleads her cause to Beaudricourt and later the Dauphin is also effective.  The DVD includes a timeline and source material that are interesting and helpful.  The subtitles are poorly written, giving ""sow"" for ""sew"", ""spacious"" for ""specious"", and sometimes rendering literal translations of idiomatic French expressions - a film so carefully made deserved better.  That small problem aside, this is easily the best of the contemporary movies about Joan of Arc.",1006041600,18,1213,5.331578947368421
