7876533,5,6304748981,"This is the best video.  Only takes 10 minutes out of your day to have a firm, tight stomach.  Before you know it, the workout is done and you feel and look great!  Love it!!!

Thanks!  Beauty Manager Annie",1330214400,,206,4.17948717948718
7876534,5,6304748981,"i love this workout! it's short & effective. the moves are tough but easy to follow. it may be a bit much for a brand new beginner, but once you work up to it, you will have noticeable results FAST! some of the oblique work may be stressful on the neck, but you can always put both hands behind the head if your neck starts to get tired.",1121644800,,337,3.9705882352941178
7876535,5,6304748981,"Yes, the workout is not too exciting and the outfits are loud, but - who cares???  It definitely works, especially alternating it w/Denise's Super Stomachs to keep different muscles stimulated.  Afterward, my muscles feel it more than with anything else (Disclaimer: haven't tried Abs of Steel yet).  Bottom line - maybe it's boring, but it's only 10 minutes, so there's never a reason to skip doing it, and you will get results - and that's what it's all about, isn't it?",1105574400,,472,4.802469135802469
7876536,3,6304748981,"This is an extremely standard workout - no frills, and not a lot of thrills.  The instructor is good and cues well, but if you're looking for anything besides classic crunches and curls to work and strenthen your abs, you probably want to look elsewhere.  My primary complaint, besides boredom, is that at the end of this workout my neck always aches from lack of support.  If you need short workouts, try the Quick Fix Abs, Tamilee Webb's I Want Those Abs, or even Denise Austin's Get Fit Fast.",1030665600,2,495,4.53932584269663
7876537,4,6304748981,"This is a good video once you stick it out for a while. It is hard on the neck at first, but once you get better, stonger abs, the neck doesn't seem to be an issue. It is a very powerful workout on the abs itself, and great for everyday since it's short. The 10 minutes fly by.",1013990400,,277,3.793103448275862
7876538,4,6304748981,"This video is a great introduction to working towards a washboard stomach.  It is relatively easy to do, and therefore easy to do every day",960768000,,139,4.56
