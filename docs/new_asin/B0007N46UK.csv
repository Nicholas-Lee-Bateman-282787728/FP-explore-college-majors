8456893,5,B0007N46UK,"Close Encounters of the 4th Kind: Infestation From Mars, or CE4K as I call it, is an amazing movie. The movie takes place in Sandusky, OH.  I was actually able to get really close to the shooting of the film as I live only 5 miles from Sandusky.  The movie is able to incorporate a local theater and the world class Cedar Point Amusement Park in it.  The choreography of the movie is also outstanding.  My favorite part is when one of the aliens spits green stuff on a boy at the theater.  This movie is a true thriller and I highly recommend the purchase of CE4K.",1137542400,6,564,4.233644859813084
