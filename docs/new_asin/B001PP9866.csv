8334169,5,B001PP9866,"Michael Kelber's ""Bricktown"" starts off a bit slow but quickly gains and maintains momentum, right to the very end.

Kelber scores a hit with his debut feature. ""Bricktown"" is a very well written and well-crafted film. In addition, the acting and musical score are also superb. Keep your eyes on this director, because this is only the beginning of what seems to be a very promising directorial journey.",1250899200,,403,4.926470588235294
8334170,4,B001PP9866,"Very low budget, independent movie, Bricktown was an absolute great movie.  Bricktown is about two friends who grow up together, get in trouble together, and remain friends as adults.  Always causing trouble and pranks when they're young, on one boring evening as adults, they decide to be jokesters again and pull another prank.  This prank will forever change both of their lives.  This movie has a twist that caught me by surprise.  Bricktown starts off real slow, but it does transition to a very good movie that not a lot of people have probably scene.  These kind of movies are usually better than the ""Blockbusters""  Please rent or buy this movie.",1243209600,,654,4.837837837837838
