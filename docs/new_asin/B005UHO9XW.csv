8486847,5,B005UHO9XW,"I got interested in glenn black and body tuning after reading about him in ""the science of yoga"" and the ny times articles that discussed  the controversy around the book, ""can yoga wreck your body?"". The body tuning DVD is brief and simply produced, only an hour with a single camera and few close ups but the information is very clear. Glenn Black explains the principles of body tuning as he generally works over 2 different clients with very different needs and ranges of movement. The demonstrated treatments are vigorously performed, fully clothed without lotions and remind me of Chinese tuina therapy. I am an acupuncturist working with pain and physical rehab clients as well as  professional athletes and performers. Body tuning is presented as an adaptable method of treatement and assessment. I am inspired by  body tuning and look forward to taking workshops with Glenn in future.",1345680000,2,893,5.02027027027027
8486848,5,B005UHO9XW,"Glenn Black is an excellent teacher of kriya yoga and bodywork, and has an amazing depth of knowledge regarding the human body and healing it.  In this DVD he works on two body types, a more limber student and a less limber student.  He illustrates a variety of ROM tests on various joints and then presents techniques for soft tissue manipulation to help mobilize the restricted areas.  It is an incredibly helpful tool for students of any bodywork modality, and Glenn's bodywork is definitely worth seeking out.  I highly recommend this product.",1336262400,,547,4.913043478260869
8486849,5,B005UHO9XW,"I can tell you from personal experience that Glenn Black is a master of the amazing art of ""Body Tuning"". Pioneered by Shmuel Tatz of New York City, ""Body Tuning"" is a multidimensional approach that incorporates techniques from many healing modalities. In this DVD Glenn shares the insight and expertise gleaned from years of experience and a profound understanding of anatomy. The DVD contains two 30 minute sessions. Glenn also has a Yoga DVD that I highly recommend as well.",1325635200,2,477,4.975
