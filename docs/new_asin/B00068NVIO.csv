8040214,5,B00068NVIO,"Brilliant video about Honda's race cars. Even how their economy cars can still compete with sport cars is amazing.

By now, most of the material is a bit old, but it's still really fun and relevant to see what the JDM guys were doing a few years back.

Cheers",1308787200,,259,4.26530612244898
8040215,5,B00068NVIO,If you like the Best Motoring or Hot Version DVDs then you'll most likely dig this. This one is centered around Honda VTEC powered vehicles. I'd recommend this,1301011200,,159,4.714285714285714
8040216,5,B00068NVIO,"one of the best Best motoring out there..i don't know if i say this because i have a honda and that im a honda head, but nonetheless very very good video..",1260316800,,155,4.032258064516129
8040217,5,B00068NVIO,"I really enjoyed buying this video gave me a much better respect for how Honda has built ALL of there sports cars. From the EK9, EP3, DC2, DC5, AP1, AP2, NA1, NA2 & Honda the TYPE-R's! Honda really shows how they've improved upon there design from generation to generation on building sports cars that last and are track capable! I thought the best part was the show off battles were they pitted the different chassis against each other. I also like that it keeps the high energy level and the ending with S2000 exhast sounds from the different manufacturers. Great video for any sports car fan and a must have for any die-hard Honda fan, you will even get an insight into what possible setups to buy for performance tuning for the different cars shown.",1254700800,,753,4.5851851851851855
8040218,4,B00068NVIO,"Overall quite good. Especially for K20A owners.

Roaring VTEC I felt was more entertaining though.

The girl ruined it a bit for me. It just wasn't necessary.",1174435200,,158,4.814814814814815
8040219,5,B00068NVIO,"As a big fan of Honda street cars, it was a no-brainer to pick up this volume of Best Motoring titled VTEC Club. Aside from being a strong titillation for Honda fans it's also one of the most entertaining, informative, and high quality releases from BMI. It's fast paced, funny (face it, these Japanese guys are silly), well shot, and has a substantial run time. I also like that it keeps the high energy level that some BMI videos, like Type-R Legend, lack. The segments are greatly varied too starting with a battle between Tsuchiya's personal NSX-R and a stock NSX-R, and moving on to things like Fit chassis tech, viewer letter answering, and a battle involving the Accord Euro-R (plus much more). Within my somewhat extensive automotive DVD collection (which includes several other BMI videos), VTEC Club ranks second place, just under 996: Still the King??? (another BMI release).",1174089600,,886,4.913333333333333
