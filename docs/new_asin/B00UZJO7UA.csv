7072508,3,B00UZJO7UA,"I honestly would give 4 stars to the film itself, which I enjoyed more than I thought I would.  However, the blu-ray it really sparse, and that's where my rating comes from.",1435708800,,173,4.40625
7072509,4,B00UZJO7UA,"What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to? Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichd cheesy line like some dinners are worth fighting for into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A.",1435536000,,1198,3.8938775510204082

7072511,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Danny Collins stars Al Pacino as the aging 1970s rock star of the title. A performer in the style of James Taylor or Neil Diamond, Danny has sold out. Though hes had a very successful career, hes managed to assemble a series of trophy wives, turn to alcohol and drugs, and bask in hedonism while continuing to fill stadiums with fans eager to experience his greatest-hits show. Dannys personal life is at a critical crossroad. He is trying to get to know his son (Bobby Cannavale) better and hes seriously interested in an age-appropriate woman (Annette Bening). Dannys agent (Christopher Plummer) devotes his time and effort sparring with Danny over the singers lifestyle choices, but his words fall on deaf ears.

The catalyst that serves to move Danny to change the direction of his life is a letter written to him 40 years ago by John Lennon. Recently discovered, the letter urges a young Danny not to squander his talent in favor of material gain. This plot point is based on a true incident. In 1971, English folk singer Steve Tilston received a letter from Lennon advising him not to worry about accumulating weralth because it wouldnt change the important things in life. Lennon signed the letter just months after The Beatles split up in December, 1970. Tilston didn't receive the letter until 2005, when he was contacted by a collector.

Pacino turns in a first-rate performance  one of his best in recent years.  His star power translates perfectly to that of the fictional music pop star. Both actor and character made it big in the 1970s, which adds an air of authenticity. Director Dan Fogelman has elicited excellent performances from the cast, though the viewer often knows whats going to happen well before its shown. Watching Dannys journey from complacency to self-awareness, however, allows Pacino to tap a wide range of emotions and paint a vivid portrait of a man trying to assess what is truly meaningful.

Extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a behind-the-scenes making-of features and a gallery of Danny Collins album covers through the years. There is also a digital HD copy.",1435449600,,2109,4.896358543417367

7072515,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Al Pacino is on a bit of a resurgence in film recently.  Late last year he turned in a fantastic critically applauded performence in the uneven film ""The Humbling"" and now he follows it up with the crowd pleaser ""Danny Collins""!  In the role of Danng Collins, Pacino plays against type as a charming, yet tormented aging rock star seeking redepmtion for his life after discovering a letter written to him by John Lennon decades prior. Pacino really shows his comedic chops in this film and the opening scene where he performs and sings live in front of a large audience really surprised me! The supporting cast is also in fine form here as well, particualarly Bobby Cannavele who plays his estranged son. Critics agreed as Danny Collins is certified fresh at 78% on Rotten Tomatoes, and the film performed well at the box office in its limited independent release. The film overall is a predictably light hearted experience with a nice ending, and definitely Pacino's best film in years!",1431820800,3,987,4.8

7072521,5,B00UZJO7UA,"This got off to a slow start for me and I considered ending it without finishing.  But somehow it kept getting better and better.  I actually shed a few tears near the end.  Al Pacino is a very good actor and not a likely choice for this role but he handles it quite well.  It kept me watching till the end and feeling good about the events in the movie.  I'd actually consider watching it again, and I don't do that with many movies.",1488067200,,434,4.119047619047619

7072525,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Just watching this talented ensemble of actors was a joy.  The story is essentially a road not taken theme, based upon a real life occurrence, that causes the main character to reassess his life.

Al Pacino brings this character to life.  Annette Bening and Christopher Plummer have supporting roles that give balance to Pacinos character.  Jennifer Garners and Bobby Cannavales performances add the emotional pull and family drama.

This 2015 movie was only 106 minutes long.  I hated to see it end.",1487203200,2,500,5.036585365853658

7072527,4,B00UZJO7UA,"It helps if you like Al Pacino, and I do. It also helps if you read the ""real story"" of the John Lennon letter to Steve Tilston. Much of the story is biographical, while some of the less believable and predictable parts, are not. Regardless, the story itself is interesting and worth seeing acted out on screen.

It was a nice little story and not something I had ever heard about in the past. Being a Beatles fan, I thought that I certainly would have heard about some of the story line.

Al Pacino in a surprising role as a pop singer who tries to establish a relationship with a son he ignored since he was born, and the difficulties that presents when his son is averse to any kind of relationship with his father. But the sudden turnaround of the father is a bit hard to swallow - from parental unconcern to amazing compassion and generousity.  But the cast make it fun to watch.",1484265600,,430,4.375

7072762,2,B00UZJO7UA,A fairly stupid piece of writing resulting in one those films that keep you on the edge of boredom and wondering whether there is something more interesting that you could be doing such as washing the car. Predictable and corny are the words that spring to mind. The lead characters are goodish but seem under rehearsed and lack any commitment or believability. Annette  Bening is such a disappointment and surely we can give her better parts than this trash. Some of the music is okay and perhaps that was the reason that I sat to the end.,1482364800,2,540,4.56701030927835
7072763,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Predictable but immensely charming movie.  Christopher Plummer as usual is outstanding.  Bobby Cannavale as usual is understated and strong.  Annette Benning's character is a bit 2 dimensional, but she soldiers on and provides a couple of beautiful moments.  Jennifer Garner is charming and brave.  Pacino is the lovable and flawed anti-hero.  I didn't want the movie to end.  Very enjoyable.",1482278400,,392,5.433333333333334

And, I watched it again. And again. And ...again. I just finished watching it for the 8th time. This movie has become a member of my family, this is how I feel. The harmony, the touching exchange between the characters is absolutely exceptional! Each and every one of them contributed immensely to this jewel. I cried each and every time, I laughed and sang this silly song for days in a row after watching the movie. I even caught the very smart bit (bravo, Al!) with Olivia Pacino. What a great dad you are! My fave scene: oh, it's so hard to pick one, but here you go: the ""tennis match"" between Danny and Mary, which I call it ""The Pattern"". The second fave one is the end. Bob Cannavale is captivating! Jennifer Garner -- you are such a talented actress! and you also are angelical beautiful ! Katarina Cas, is doing an excellent job, I fell in love with her talent (because I didn't see her before in any movies), my fave part: where she props her fingers (hands) on her hand to express a situation (no spoiler here).  And those cute and with a perfect smile teenagers, the kids at the hotel --- so charismatic! Excellent, excellent cast!, thank you, Mindy Marin !!! Exceptional movie! I love Pacino even more -- if that's even remotely possible. I love you, Al, thanks for your movies! May you live forever!!!",1481587200,,1412,4.5810276679841895

7072836,5,B00UZJO7UA,"This is a lovely story, with excellent acting!  All of the characters in it (and they were all big name actors) completely transcended every prior role that any of them have ever had in order to completely immerse themselves in their current role.  The plot is somewhat reminiscent of the movie ""The Wrestler"" which was about a wrester who couldn't manage when he tried to change his life and live in a non-wrestling world.  Al Pacino has that same struggle.  While he isn't as animated at Neil Diamond, whom presumably this movie is loosely about, he is quite believable as a washed up singer with a long history of drinking and drugging.  As for Annette Benning, well, a rule in life seems to be, if you want to see a great movie, follow Annette Benning, and she will take you there.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I'm so glad it showed up in the list of movies ""that other customers watched"" or else I would never have found it.  What a gem!",1480982400,,944,4.4476744186046515

For me personally, i don't know which would be worse.  This lukewarm, unconvincing portrayal of an old rock star took about an hour of my time whereupon it again refused to grow any sack and instead doubled down on the treachly sap (i guess because it had nothing else to do at that point).

I realize now Scent of a Wyman was just a decades-in-advance review of just how flatulent Al Pacino can get.  This is  peak old man ass gas right here.",1480982400,,646,4.262295081967213

7072907,3,B00UZJO7UA,"Al Pacino just didn't quite feel like Al Pacino. I can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I don't have a desire to re-watch it, but I had a good time while I did view it. Honestly, I would have loved just for the whole movie to be about Pacino's antics as an entertainer. The family drama, which I understand was the whole crux of the movie, just felt like it dragged to me.",1476316800,,387,3.9743589743589745

7072916,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Everyone has summed up the themes of the movie in these reviews. The only thing I can add is that if you are not an Al Pacino fan, you are going to be. If you don't know who Bobby Carnavale is,  you will remember his name now. If you thought Jennifer Garner was just a sexy star with a sweet face, you will think again.

This was one of the more suspenseful, emotionally satisfying movies I've ever seen. Even the one predictable scene was such a small part of the movie that it doesn't matter in the end. Such a good experience to see this film!",1474934400,,546,4.1415094339622645

7072921,5,B00UZJO7UA,"My wife and I attended "" An evening with Al Pacino "" where he was on stage for a couple of hours telling many stories about the majority of his films.
It was amazing and he talked about Danny Collins, his most recent film and we hadn't had it come to our city yet. When we saw it, it was like he had stepped off stage that night and stepped onto the movie set ( same suit ) for the filming.
This movie is really good............. WATCH IT !",1474848000,,440,3.955056179775281
7072922,5,B00UZJO7UA,It is a movie that provides the reality of a star whose life was on the fast lane and therefore forgot the little things in life. Based on a some what real story and certainly a great cast. Al Pacino does a great job in showing a softer nicer guy role. This is a movie to watch without the little ones.,1474848000,,302,3.9672131147540983

7072924,3,B00UZJO7UA,"An overall entertains film nonetheless misses the mark by creating an unsympathetic character who already 'has it all.' Pacino's goes on a journey of epic ""first-world-problems"" that strays far from the tenuous real-life germ of a tragic opportunity lost due to someone else's greed. A film closer to the true story would have made a great movie I f taken in that direction.",1474675200,,374,4.9523809523809526

7072960,5,B00UZJO7UA,"I was looking for a comedy.  I saw the Danny Collins trailer at the show last year.  I remembered it looking interesting.  I watched it last night and enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.  The ending was excellent.  Excellent cast.  They brought a lot of intelligence and depth to the characters.  I was really blown away by Bobby Cannavalle.  I thought his scenes with Al Pacino were the best with Annette Bening coming in at a close second.  This is a meditative movie about loss, second acts, an artistic career that has turned into a soul killing gravy train and a last ditch effort to have a happy life.  It's about the sacrifices we make for love and family.  And, it's peripherally about John Lennon with a great score with, of course, songs sung by John Lennon.  Really a delight to have found this film.  Not a weak moment anywhere.  I was expecting them, too.",1473120000,,876,4.462025316455696

7072987,4,B00UZJO7UA,I love watching Al Pacino act so I may be a bit biased.  The movie is a hybrid -- part romantic comedy with the flirtatious banter between Danny Collins and hotel manager Mary (labeled as such by the characters; and part drama as Collins tries to re-capture the past creativity of his youth and to connect with a grown son (and his family that he never was permitted to know.

And, I found each of the actors playing a role I'd not seen them play before, which added to my delight in this movie.  Pacino's character was especially likeable, though, at times, difficult to believe (you know those people in the world who you meet and find yourself saying, as you walk away, ""Really?  Don't you see the you you present to the world?')  Danny Collins doesn't grab you by the ...., but you leave it feeling better for having seen it.",1462924800,,530,4.3232323232323235

7073245,4,B00UZJO7UA,"I found this film to be entertaining and enjoyable.  Its a good, if somewhat shop-worn story about a man who abandons his parental responsibilities, only to regret it and try to make amends late in life.  Al Pacino plays the lousy father as a wealthy, rockstar jerk who wises up due to a found thirty-year-old letter of encouragement from John Lennon.  I'm not a Pacino fan, but he does okay in this one.  Annette Benning plays a supporting role as a love interest.  One regret is that the movie really fails to make use of Benning's fine talents.  This movie is rated R and is definitely an adult feature.  I recommend it as serviceably entertaining.",1462406400,,651,4.608695652173913

7073250,3,B00UZJO7UA,"Nothing like the movie trailer.  Much more of a drama.  The trailer advertised the film as a light hearted romantic comedy for late middle agers, but it actually covers much more serious subject matter.  It's good, but difficult to overcome the false expectations from the way it was marketed.  I was geared for a light movie going experience, but got a mostly serious drama about life regrets and the struggle to overcome them before its too late.  A great cast with strong performances.",1462320000,,488,4.831325301204819

7073266,5,B00UZJO7UA,"This is probably the best picture Pacino has ever made! Even if it's not, I will always be convinced of it. It showed a whole new side of his acting ability, and it's pretty darn  great.  The entire cast was put together with an exceptional result.  The little girl, Hope, who was played by Giselle Eisenberg, stole the whole show. She was quite amazing as far as this reviewer is concerned.  DANNY COLLINS  will run you through a whole gambit of emotions as you sit glued to the screen.  I found myself giggling like a young girl at his charming flirtation with ''Mary"", I grieved for his son's anger toward him, I felt heartsick and disappointment when he lost his resolve and fell back into his addiction, and I cried tears jubilation at the end.

7073290,5,B00UZJO7UA,"This movie will appeal to older viewers who identify with the tribulations of a very old pop superstar who is trying to connect with an illegitimate child he had with a groupie.  No so easy to do.  Annette Benning and Jennifer Gargner provide tremendous acting talent to go along with Al Pacino's unique acting style as a very old drug addicted and flawed pop star. Christopher Plummer is also great as his very old agent and the little girl that plays his granddaughter rivals any beloved Shirley Temple scenes.  Unfortunately, Pacino's character is both an alcoholic and a drug addict, which makes the movie interesting, but difficult to watch at times and not suitable for young people.",1461283200,,689,4.871794871794871

His performance brought a lot of nuance to a complex character and he never defaulted to Pacino Parody like in The Devil's Advocate or Any Given Sunday. Jennifer Garner was as sweet as ever and Annette Benning was very charming. An all-around enjoyable movie that doesn't drag at all (106 minutes) even if the ending felt uneven.

Somewhere he was instilled with the knowledge of right and wrong, and what doing the right thing was.  Once he made the connection with his son, he did not give up.  It also showed the vulnerability and the fear we all face when it comes to putting ourselves out there with something new -- stepping outside our boxes.

7073453,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Every book, song, and film needs a hook, something for the reader, listener, or watcher to hang onto in order to invest his or her time for the duration. The hook in the film under review, Danny Collins, is a letter written to the title singer/songwriter character by John Lennon telling him not to prostitute his creative energies for filthy lucre. (Lennon did write a letter on that subject to an English singer not to Danny so that part is true.)The letter though never got delivered to him until some forty plus years later. That revelation though acts as an epiphany for our boy Danny, played by haven't seen him in a long time Al Pacino in a stellar performance, to turn his life around. Go back to the basics of what he had originally intended to do with his musical talents and hence the tale of redemption in the headline to this review.

See Danny had not done what John suggested as he had sold out his talent early on after an initial failure at doing his own music. He then accepted bubble gum material provided by others which led to fame and fortune as a rock and roll star complete with filthy lucre. After getting the Lennon letter as a birthday gift from his manager (played by Christopher Plummer) as he turned sixty-something with a life full of drugs, sex with younger women (twenty-somethings including his live-in fianc), and an over-the-top lifestyle he decided to put the brakes on that slide, try to put things right musically and personally.

So Danny headed to a Hilton, a Hilton in New Jersey if you can believe that redemption is possible in the Garden State. There he gives up, mostly, his wild boy lifestyle and along the way hits on the more age-appropriate manager, played by fetching Annette Bening. But Danny is not in Jersey for the sunny weather but to square things with a son that he had never known, the result of a youthful fling with some groupie. Of course fatherhood for a free-booting rock and roll legend is bound to be a rocky road, and it is. Just as son-hood is for a straight working class guy with an expectant wife and a hyper-active young daughter. Top all that off with the fact that the son, Tom, has a rare maybe fatal disease and you definitely have a rocky road to redemption.

But Danny tries, tries hard first of all by helping out with the hyper-active granddaughter, then helping his son get through what he had to get through with his treatments, and most of all he tries to get back to that original music dream of his playing stuff that he had written and canning the bubble gum music that made his career. Our boy Danny stumbled a lot along the way, didn't quite get it right with his son and daughter-in-law for most of the film, didn't quite connect with that more age appropriate woman as hard as he tried, and wasn't able, at least in the film, to break from that music that gave him his old lifestyle. But the guy tried, tried and maybe redemption would come later. Despite some predictable syrupy stuff around the granddaughter and his sons illness a pretty good story line about the price of fame and fortune in the real world. At the end is a nice touch with an interview with the singer whom John Lennon really sent that letter to.",1457136000,,3207,4.497427101200686

Instead of a tough guy, he plays an aging rocker looking to connect with the son he had no time for while riding high in the music biz.  Good performances from Jennifer Garner, Bobby Cannivale, Annette Benning and Christopher Plummer.

I like a movie that gives me some laughs, and maybe a little cry. This one had it all. Afterwards, I found out it was also a true story! If you like John Lennon, this is for you!

7073607,1,B00UZJO7UA,"Awful! This tired rehash of the rockstar who fathers children in his wild days, then promptly discards them, only to try to become an attentive father in his declining years, is a script that has already been whipped to boredom in other movies. This one was supposed to have been elevated by it's ""superb cast"" headed up by the legendary Al Pacino. When Al does a serious role like the Godfather or the Scent Of A Woman, he's magnetic and amazing. When he hams it up like he does here, he looks campy, affectatious, ridiculous and like he just left his first acting class. Just awful!",1455580800,,584,4.518867924528302

We don't usually like the typical ""romantic comedy"" - and this looked a little bit silly and over the top in the trailer - but for some reason we gave it a try and we really enjoyed it.

7073676,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Huge cast, cute movie. Al Pacino cannot sing which makes it all the more funny that he portrays a washed up singer trying to get his mojo back after decades of pleasing his geriatric fans with one hit wonders. Nice to watch a movie that has literally no swearing or violence.",1454630400,,275,4.411764705882353
7073677,4,B00UZJO7UA,Al Pacino is amazing in this movie. He is totally believable as a washed up singer who now hopes to perform his own material and become a serious performer. The cast is incredible and Annette Bening delightful. The film is extremely well done all the way through.,1454544000,,263,4.617021276595745

7073707,5,B00UZJO7UA,This was a really good movie. I wasn't expecting much and thought it wasn't going to be as good as it turned out to be. Al Pacino and the man who plays his son we're both really good. The storyline was great an overall I'd watch this movie over and over again.,1454544000,,260,4.019230769230769
7073708,1,B00UZJO7UA,"I wanted to like it because of the cast line up, but I'm sorry Hollywood, I've been schooled on too many great movies and tv shows of late to be able to digest this schmaltzy rubbish",1454544000,,182,4.083333333333333

7073719,5,B00UZJO7UA,"It was so much better than I thought with tour de force performances by Plummer, Pacino and Bening",1454544000,,98,4.5
7073720,3,B00UZJO7UA,"This was sad and happy, wistful and melancholic, as it brings to mind how our society struggles to decide how to treat our aging rock stars.  They seem to go on forever, and audiences grow older with them. Overall, a very good light dramatic movie, and Al Pacino and Annette Bening were wonderful as always.  Even at this stage of his career, Pacino's versatility is still on display!",1454544000,,384,4.632352941176471
7073721,5,B00UZJO7UA,Surprisingly fresh and entertaining. The story line sounded like the film would drag and get bogged down with flashbacks and memories. However the story moved briskly and Pacino did a fantastic job in a role that I feared would be outside of his wheel house. I was wrong!,1454544000,,271,4.666666666666667
7073722,5,B00UZJO7UA,It was interesting,1454544000,,18,5.333333333333333
7073723,3,B00UZJO7UA,It was enjoyable but at times I felt embarrassed watching Al Pacino slither around trying to look cool.  Perhaps that was the intention. Overall the plot was trite and predictable. And the old man (Pachino) still managed to get the much younger Annette Bening!,1454544000,,260,4.909090909090909

7073743,3,B00UZJO7UA,I thought it was OK--Pacino acted like he had phoned in his part--and I found the premise clichd (aging rock star with young ingnue/long lost son).  I did enjoy watching his tenacity in trying to help the family--glad I watched it once--but that was it for me,1454457600,,259,4.51063829787234
7073744,5,B00UZJO7UA,Al Pacino and the rest of the cast are great!,1454457600,,45,3.6

7073746,4,B00UZJO7UA,"I like Cannavale's acting, but, of course, seasoned Plummer stole the show as Pacino's sidekick. The dynamic between Benning and Pacino was reminiscent of Hanks and Ryan with their ""patter."" It wasn't much of a tear-jerker with the light comedy involved, but it did the job for a cuddle-fest with my wife.",1454457600,,305,4.884615384615385
7073747,5,B00UZJO7UA,Al Pacino always a cut above the rest!,1454457600,,38,3.875

7073749,5,B00UZJO7UA,This movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time! Al Pacino at his best!,1454371200,,88,3.45

7073751,5,B00UZJO7UA,Al Pacino is a classic!,1454371200,,23,3.8
7073752,4,B00UZJO7UA,All star cast doesn't disappoint. Based loosely off of events that probably happened...Al Pacino's portrayal of Danny Collins is superb. He is a flawed man who in-spite of himself brings a strong dose true humanity to friends and family in need. Danny Collins is a movie that will take you on a ride of highs(literally and figuratively) and lows all wrapped up with a feel good ending. This movie is for mature audiences only as it shows drug use and has adult themes throughout.,1454371200,,479,4.714285714285714

7073756,3,B00UZJO7UA,"When the first scene started, I was thinking maybe this wasn't going to be all that good. I mean, Al Pacino doing a really bad impression of Neil Diamond? What was I thinking?

7073764,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Pacino should have been nominated for best actor. Character suited to his sometimes over-the-top style of acting.  Emotional and funny. But then again, he's an old white guy. Maybe he should have done another 1940's blacklist story. Hollywood can't get enough of those.",1454284800,,269,5.255813953488372

7073974,5,B00UZJO7UA,"If you can get over the awful sound of Al Pacino being a rock singer, this move is wonderful. It have warmth and humor and shows the depth and breath of Pacino's acting. I am sure in his real life, he gets the rock star treatment everyday so playing a rock star and having people fall all over him is something he has great experience at. Bobby Cannevale, who plays his never seen before adult son by a groupie one nighter is also excellent. Cannevale also has great range as he can play the tough guy with a big heart and an evil gangster as he was in Boardwalk. Jennifer Gardner is a surprise character actor in this but she knocks it out of the ballpark.

My wife and I rarely watch a movie together and have a similar favorable opinion but in this movie's case, we both loved it! A great movie!",1452988800,,798,4.215686274509804

(Jack & Jill, 88 minutes, Two for the Money, Gigli ...) The premise is (as others have noted) a wee bit heavy handed & predictable - but it is lifted not only by excellent performances (even the young girl), and the quirk of reality of the Lennon letter.

7074011,4,B00UZJO7UA,"The best part of this film is the background music by John Lennon!  The acting and portrayal of the main character is nuanced and varies from eliciting commiseration to disgust for anyone like me in real recovery from the disease of addiction.  I find it difficult to forgive Danny's in and out again attempts to be a ""real Dad and Grandpa"", but then a lot of that is his failure to stay in Sobriety.  For all of us who  engage in the day to day struggle to overcome the addictions of substance use and abuse, this film does nothing to encourage us to continue in that work.  And, it is work to be true to yourself, which apparently Danny wasn't able to follow through on!  How sad and it's a commentary on hiow the mighty, rich and famous fail in this world to set an honest path to redemption.

Pacino is another Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Gary Cooper rolled into one. His mannerisms are ""old hat"" and he's a bit short in stature but big in personality. He is comfortable to watch in whatever role he plays. You wish him well and are very forgiving. Danny Collins is not Oscar material but it is also not offensive in language or images.",1449273600,,663,4.354838709677419

7074121,3,B00UZJO7UA,Solid first act seeing Danny's change of heart about where he is and what he wants for the remainder of his life. His connection to Annette Benning's character is way too cute and not really believable. A couple of drinks and she falls into his lap.

Instead, while he's an old rocker (but so is McCartney and Jagger!), he's got great intentions and is a sweet guy. He's got some issues that come in to play, but he's good to the the average - non-celebrity - people around him. I liked this movie and would watch it again.

It is precisely the script writer and musical director that should be pistol whipped for this embarrassment of a film, but not in that order.  Is it too much to ask that the pivotal song not sound like it was written by an eight-year old?

7074265,5,B00UZJO7UA,"It's true. I've never liked Al Pacino as an actor. Yes. Yes. I know I am in the minority but still, I don't like him as an actor. So when I decided to watch this movie, I expected to be disappointed.  Well, I absolutely wasn't.  I wish they had cast someone else other than Al Pacino in the title role but other than that, it was a great movie.  Aging rock star, tired of singing the old songs that made him famous and then the surprising tie-in to John Lennon.  The rest of the cast is superb.  I am so tired of the super-hero, special effects, dumb story lines and frenetic pace of so many movies.  This movie has an easy pace and is wonderful to watch.  The best thing was, I couldn't anticipate where the story line was going.  The tear jerker ending was well done.

7074301,4,B00UZJO7UA,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought it was a comedy. The movie is so much more than that...it explores the price you pay for choosing your career over a family. It was a serious film about re-evaluating your life choices, the pain of loss and the journey of redemption. Very well acted with comedic moments as well as deeply serious issues.",1448409600,,358,4.4393939393939394

7074305,5,B00UZJO7UA,"This is a remarkable film because it's a mature drama, yes drama, depicting human struggle, and how people overcome life's setbacks in different ways. This story can only be portrayed by a remarkable cast such as Al Pacino, Annette Bening and Christopher Plummer. Bobby Cannavale as the husband and son did a great job to pull all the characters together in this story. Al Pacino's performance was outstanding and I found myself getting into his character and getting excited for him and then angry when he would fail and then rise up again. Like his long lost son, you couldn't really let yourself dislike this man, as much as you wanted to, because in the end, he had a lot of heart.",1448409600,,685,4.622950819672131

7074309,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Great acting all around! This movie seemed disjointed at the start, but it settled into a smooth groove and was very entertaining. Bobby Cannavale stole the show as Pacino's son, all eyebrows and elbows and emotion in every frame. And that's saying a lot, given the caliber of the rest of the cast.  Go for it.",1448409600,,310,4.535714285714286
7074310,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Danny Collins was a really nice movie.  No murders, rapes, or physical abuse.  The drug and alcohol  was probably typical of the work and life style.

7074312,3,B00UZJO7UA,"It is entertaining, with great acting, great cast.  And the John Lennon sound track is a big plus.  Pacino portrays the character more like an aged actor, it seems, than like an aged rock star.

Well worth the watch and the music soundtrack is great - I mean John Lennon - what's not to like?,1448323200,,272,4.09433962264151
7074354,2,B00UZJO7UA,"Pacino miscast. Bening really annoying. Garner could do this role in her sleep. Cannavale did the best he could with the writing, as did Plummer. 2 stars is very generous - always good to see Garner (in anything).",1448323200,,213,4.631578947368421

7074356,2,B00UZJO7UA,"Al Pacino is not believable as an aging rock star. l'm not sure if he was trying to channel Neil Diamond (which would make sense on some level), or if he thought he could actually rise to the level of say Rod Stewart or Steven Tyler (he can not). in the end, it was a cringe worthy story innexcusable hamming. I found myself listening to the sound track with my eyes closed. Annette Bening was a treat.",1448323200,,402,4.233766233766234

7074362,1,B00UZJO7UA,"Considering all the star power in this movie, I  expected better. Had no sympathy for main character and have never known a Pacino characterization not to evoke emotions.  Kept waiting for movie to get better. It never got better, it just ended. Glad I didn't see this at movie theater or pay extra for it. Waste of time and money. Last minutes of documentary footage were more interesting than this movie. Would have enjoyed seeing more of that.",1448323200,,446,4.705128205128205
7074363,4,B00UZJO7UA,"I didn't notice at first that it was rated R which entailed at the beginning a little top frontal nudity and some language that was definitely R rated.  BUT after about 5 minutes of that stuff, it turned into a really good story.  The R stuff really didn't need to be in the movie.  Al Pacino was good...same with the rest of the cast.  Because the story was so good and touching, I gave it a 4.  Without the nudity and language it could have been a 5 in my opinion.",1448323200,,466,4.076923076923077

7074410,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Al Pacino is absolutely amazing. I can't picture another actor bringing the charm, swagger, humor, or heartbreak to this role on the level that he delivers. This film is an underrated gem. While it follows some predictable story beats along the way, that doesn't hold it back from delivering big time on an entertainment and emotional scale. I've already praised Pacino, who is in top form, but all the other actors bring their A-game as well. Really enjoyable, fun, and well-made.
Also, I loved that we didn't get the typical ""everything is roses"" ending one might expect from a movie like this. The ending is, in all honesty, fairly ambiguous.",1448236800,,645,4.872727272727273

7074413,4,B00UZJO7UA,Al Pacino is an excellent character actor.  He nails it as the aging rock star when a surprise gift sets him on a quest to clean up his act and heal some wounds.  Annette Bening is cute in her supporting role as friend and motivator.,1448236800,,233,4.155555555555556

7074416,5,B00UZJO7UA,"The movie set up and the involvement of late-career Pacino gave me pause. I didn't want to see a hammy performance reminiscent of Scent of a Woman, but early on I bought in to the character because of Pacino's road-weary interpretation if him. His chemistry with the other characters is great, and it is a joy to watch the scenes with him and Annette Bening , who is great in this movie as always.

Pacino (at the helm), Bening and Plummer deliver great performances. Some of the lesser known actors ain't chopped liver either. A new child star is born. At the start, I couldn't understand how the director let an actor, child, or not, be so hyper. Shortly, it was revealed that she is ADHD which is at the center of the story.

Al Pacino is excellent in the title role and the supporting cast is brilliant. I appreciate the fact that the story was inspired by an actual event. I liked everything about this film. It achieved a level of believability and authenticity rare for the genre. It isn't a comedy, not a drama or a romance. it's a little bit all of those, and very much like real life. If you are looking for a film that is well written, acted and directed, a film you will enjoy investing a couple of hours into watching, I recommend Danny Collins.

Christopher Plummer plays his agent, and Cannavale the son he never knew (since it was the product of a one-night stand). Also, did I mention that Jennifer Garner is in this movie (as Cannavale's wife) and a very cute nine year old girl with a severe case of ADD....as is Annette Benning as the manager of a Hilton in the New Jersey town where Cannavale lives.

It was like watching the original Pacino who really got into the character instead of screaming his way through his lines. He was very believable and sympathetic. The rest of the cast did a great supporting job. As a lifelong Lennon fan I was thrilled that John's music was the soundtrack for the movie.

7074770,5,B00UZJO7UA,"I'm not a movie reviewer, and I with Amazon would just let me assign stars and be done with it. But I liked Danny Collins so much I am putting up with the imposition.  So I'll try, but I'll fail.  Every time I recommend this film to a friend -- and I have done that every chance I've had since watching it -- my descriptions make it sound either sappy and melodramatic, or in poor taste, or clownish.  But it's the opposite of all those things, but I don't know how to convey it.  Okay, maybe this: it's a lightweight film done excellently by consummate professionals. Pacino has been working his whole life toward this role. If you liked ""Scent of a Woman"", you'll like ""Danny Collins.""  If you didn't like ""Scent of a Woman"", you'll still like ""Danny Collins.""  This is Pacino being Pacino, but at his very best.  Annette Bening is the perfect counterpoint to Pacino's character -- sane, not taken in by him, her character has enough respect for herself and him not to become another one of his bimboes. And then there's Bobby Canavale -- I've never seen him like this, perfect in the role of the abandoned son.  And the granddaughter -- well she is my only concern in the whole film. She is a delight, smart way beyond her years, a six-year-old with the vocabulary to beat most adults, but just a little girl, cute and curious. The parents say she has Attention Deficit Disorder and needs special ed.  I'm no expert, but even though she gets wound up and ""can't stop talking"", she didn't convince me that she was exhibiting a pathology. I was thinking more like, she needs more challenging books to read, and maybe more challenging people to converse with.  But maybe I'm wrong about that.",1447459200,,1692,4.518032786885246

7074804,2,B00UZJO7UA,"Acting? Come on, read the cast. 5 stars. But the story - after all, no movie is better than its script - 1 star. What's with the compulsion of some writers,  to turn a decent story line into a medical drama? This writer turned a dream-cast feature into another episode of House MD.
Maybe he porked  out on GMO foods and factory-farm McGrub until he faced a ""health crisis"" of his own. The story could've had so much more depth - visit the son on the job, really stretch their differences.  I could see that plot going a lot of different places, but a clinic and an ADHD school?

7074898,2,B00UZJO7UA,The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because of Al Pacino.  The movie itself is dreadful.  The plot is unoriginal.  The dialogue is painful.

7074900,2,B00UZJO7UA,"""Danny Collins"" starts with an interesting premise, but does not deliver on the promise.  I was left wondering what the key takeaway was supposed to be from this film. Although a great actor, Pacino is not believable in the lead as a fading pop star, and this is yet another film that puts Jennifer Garner in a ""supporting role"" as a marginal character with very, very little to do and very little impact on the story.  ""Danny Collins"" is not a terrible film, but despite the star power and breezy production, the story, characters, and central conflicts are paper thin and ultimately make for a forgettable film.",1447286400,,613,4.719626168224299

Some good acting, and witty dialogue (especially from Bening and Plummer).  But the movie just doesn't hold up.

7075046,2,B00UZJO7UA,"Danny Collins had a mediocre story line. It was like Al took this pathetic role on just to pay some back taxes! He was a terrible fit, and completely unbelievable. The whole thing was just sad and made me embarrassed for Al Pacino. If you are an Al Pacino fan prepare yourself for disappointment in the role. I don't recommend this one at all..........I'm sure the only way to sell this one was with Al.....maybe he was doing someone a favor.....sad.",1447113600,,450,4.567901234567901

I liked Pacino and Plummer in their roles as aging, wealthy music insiders, but was disappointed in Bening's character. She came across as more lifeless than her character needed to be. I was intrigued by the ""based on a true story"" aspect of the film, and did some reading on the history of the actual Lennon letter. That part was interesting.",1447027200,2,423,4.72972972972973

7075057,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Hell of a movie. First thought after reading the movie details and cast was ""Al Pacino as rock star? No freakin' way."" Crap, he pulled it off masterfully. I bought what this movie was selling and by the time the movie wrapped up I found myself rewinding it to make sure that I hadn't missed anything. There's always a ""but"" somewhere,  and here is no different. They make him too flawless of a rocker (ok, the cocaine, the fake drunken stooper). He's too bright and coherent. He's also too guruish (peace & love). What happened to the air-headed enlightenment of an elder rocker or the coo coo bird philosophical/geo-political wittiness? The movie is too good to slight that 1/3 of the 5th star. Having a short cast (which worked well--straight to the point) that carries the entire movie makes you feel that these actors are as good as billed. ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD! STOP MAKING FAKE EMOTIONAL MOVIES WITH HAPPY ENDINGS. I KNOW EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT AT THE END OF THE MOVIE *Side-bar* I've just read that Yoko Ono's input required that the movie have a message of peace.

I found it mildly amusing. Pacino was very miscast in this movie. He's a powerful actor and this movie wasn't a good match. imo Good to see Bening making movies again but I would like to see her take on better movies. I love Cannavale but he's also too talented for this movie as well and I had a hard time watching him the most in this movie. The movie was like a Volkswagen with (actors) Rolls Royce engine, it did't fit.

Too many big named powerful actors in a middle-of-the-road feel-good-happy-ending comedy so, it just didn't work for me.",1447027200,,651,4.371900826446281

It just looked cheesy.  After watching it, I couldn't have been more wrong.  Pacino was great - he didn't even spit or yell once.  The movie was well written, had brilliant performances (come on!  Pacini, Bening, Plummer and Cannavale) and was endearing without being schmaltzy or trite. It was a feel-good movie with heart and brains",1447027200,,490,4.6395348837209305

7075205,3,B00UZJO7UA,"For me, this film couldn't decide what it was -- a musician's tale, re-connect with family drama, love story or social commentary. And, while it contained all of those things, it seem to jump in and out each, rather than function as a whole. Don't get me wrong, I thought Pacino's performance was excellent, and his character's growth over the course of the movie was clear; and the choice of Lennon music for the soundtrack was perfect; but I guess what I'm saying is that without that, this would just be another B movie. In fact, the star power of this film is what made it.

On a personal note, I guess I was also taken back by that ridiculous song Collins sang, and the old ladies in the audience. I know what they were trying to portray, but it could have been done better -- I was annoyed by it.

Otherwise, I enjoyed the flick, had a few laughs, and felt some of the emotion; so what they hey...",1447027200,2,903,4.305882352941176

Glad I didn't pay for this one, but the writing is digestible even if it is cliche.  Kind of like high quality bubble gum.  Don't expect much character development.  Don't expect much range.

Garner, Plummer and Eisenberg's acting supports the others and are just as brilliant. All the actors deserve mention. It's the subtle interaction between the cast that is its success as well as the songs, Thanks Yoko. Fogleman got this one really right. I mean it, watch it a second time and you will agree with the amazing acting synergy. Watch Pacino's hands, the gestures, tells it all.

7075378,3,B00UZJO7UA,"The movie was enjoyable in many ways, mainly due to the stellar cast. Also the premise behind the film is pretty fascinating. But it struck me as overly sweet. This movie had the chance to have some edge to it and instead it was lite, lite, lite. This movie didn't need to be so pleasant. It could have been more challenging, instead it was candy. But a Pacino sighting is never bad, and a Christopher Plummer sighting, wow, I was REALLY thrilled with that. Also Bobby Cannavale is really great. The Annete Benning character bothered me, although I guess her performance wasOK. I just felt the movie was sugar coated, when it should have been more raw. Also, I draw a blank when I try to make an analogy between the Danny Collins character and some 70's star that really lived. Let's see, he started out as a singer songwriter and ended up as a Neil Diamond or Barry Manilow kind of guy? That didn't make sense to me.
I did really enjoy that at the very end they showed the real dude (a folk singer, they said) who had the experience that was at the core of this movie.",1446854400,,1069,4.35

7075441,3,B00UZJO7UA,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Nice to see ol' AL in his supreme prime, playing subdued, redemption seeking, but still seXy roles. It is 2015, give it up already, but I just can't say no to seeing the Great One perform.

Most of the dialogue did not impress, the plot weak and predictable, several overly dramatic scenes BUT what I truly enjoyed was John Lennon's music overlays. I never really appreciated Lennon very much as my other friends who worshiped him. I thought he was over hyped and ignored most of his contributions.

However, this film subtly caught my attention to his lyrics because I watched with closed captions due to poor audio on my antiquated netbook. What a difference that makes when you realize that John not only sung but wrote the lyrics. Amazing to me now!

The gradual buildup of each selection was genius imho. With the ending crescendo of his ""We All Shine On"", I was goose fleshed. What a beautiful testament to his talent. Although this film is loosely based on his long lost letter, I was very pleased to receive this long lost gift of his music with this movie.",1446768000,,1107,4.604060913705584

7075445,3,B00UZJO7UA,It was fun and brainless.  Al Pacino can not sing...at all.  It was better than faking it though.  Annette Bening was Annette Bening..Garner was Garner and Pacino Pacino.....none of these actors are ever anything but who they have become.  Doesn't mean I don't like them.,1446768000,,271,4.955555555555556

7075449,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Everyone needs a hero every once in awhile to fulfill a need and that same person who was needy at one point in their life can be the hero to someone else if for only a moment they take their eyes off themselves and consider the pain of others. The greatest high a person can have is sacrificing themselves for others. Self indulgence is a sickness, sacrificing for the want of others who are in need is the cure. It is amazing that some writer in Hollywood had the insight to write a beautiful story about second chances and third chances. Al Pacino is Al Pacino and this was perfect story for him to tell. This movie was good to the last drop. Never give up, stay in the fight and keep trying. This movie is also about addictions which all addictions begin with the need to fill that in yourself called loneliness. Ask the Lord to take away that loneliness and He will and fill you with the Holy Spirit and you will never be alone again and because the Lord is with you and you are going to Heaven then there is nothing in this world to be afraid of because God has your back always. So live your life as the hero because someone needs you out there.",1446768000,,1152,4.217194570135747

7075501,5,B00UZJO7UA,Charming and feel good movie. I was pleasantly surprised. All Pacino was wonderful without being too shouty as he sometimes is. This roll was meant for him. Added bonus is the music is original songs by John Lennon. Don't know how they managed to get copyright permission but the music is awesome since the movie is about a letter Lennon wrote to young Danny Collins. Annette Bening had good chemistry with Pacino too.,1446595200,,418,4.739726027397261

7075505,5,B00UZJO7UA,"I have never been a fan of the Beatles, but loved every song in this wonderful movie. I finally became a believer. It's so difficult to detail what you loved about a movie, without spoilers. You'll have to decide if all those 5 stars draw you in. I loved the reality of it, the flawed characters (that don't end a movie with an unrealistic applaud from total strangers....that is a rom-com Paul. Because a movie brings a tear to your eye, does not make it a chick flick. Or maybe I looked at it differently because I had parents who gave me up....a few times, but they weren't famous, just narcissistic. If you have, or had, parent's, some of this will go over your head, but it's so much more than that. Everyone has regrets.
I can't say enough good things about this gem, so I'll stop trying.

Not a movie that will leave an impact on your outlook in life or how you would care for others around you because obviously if you had that kind of money and a small shred of moral fiber you wouldnt waste it on such a self-indulgent lifestyle. In the end I couldn't relate to any of the characters, none were believable.

7075563,5,B00UZJO7UA,"I loved this movie.  It's based (loosely) on a true story about a young musician who expressed concern in an interview with a music magazine that success would have a negative impact on his art.  When he read the article, John Lennon disagreed and sent a handwritten letter to the young musician in care of the writer at the magazine.  In the letter John voiced assurances that success did not necessarily lead to loss of music expression and included his home phone number so the young man could call him and they could talk.  Unfortunately, the writer of the article never forwarded the letter to the musician, choosing instead to keep it for himself.  It wasn't until many years later that a collector of Beatles memorabilia who had bought the letter after the writer passed away sent a copy of it to the artist.  What the movie does is pose the question, what impact would receiving that letter have made on Danny Collin's life?  In the movie Danny is a famous rock star played by Al Pacino, who, ironically enough, changed his music to achieve success rather than it happening the other way around.  The impact of receiving the letter is that it makes Pacino reevaluate his self absorbed lifestyle.  A fine cast with Pacino as Danny Collins, Annette Benning as his leading lady, Bobby Cannavale as his son, and Jennifer Garner as his daughter-in-law.  The little girl who plays Al Pacino's granddaughter is surprisingly good.  Sprinkled throughout the movie are many favorite songs by John Lennon which makes it a real joy to listen to as well as watch.",1446422400,,1558,4.733333333333333

7075587,3,B00UZJO7UA,"A so-so movie that is worth viewing once. Al Pacino plays Danny Collins, an aging folk singer who is living and touring on the more famous songs of his career. He receives a letter from John Lennon 40 years late where Lennon tries to warn him of the dangers of fame for a talented artist such as himself. Danny decides to turn over a new leaf on his aged, hard rocking ways, begin writing again, and reunite with a son he had never had the opportunity to know.
A secondary plot line is the relationship of the hotel manager played by Annette Benning at the hotel he is staying at while visiting his son.
A bit formulaic and seemingly a bit forced, it is another Pacino film and watchable in its own regard as that. It was free on Amazon Prime; there was little else on that I wanted to see and this was new content. Was it great? No. Was it awful? No, again. Was it Pacino?

His few stage scenes in this movie show him with awkward stage presence not to mention the totally unrealistic handling of the microphone. And he should not have sang...at all. I might have been able to get into the character more if someone else had sung the lines in some manner that I could believe flowed from an aging man who was at one time a presumptively excellent vocalist (since he was rich and successful, but nowadays I don't suppose that necessarily follows). Anyway...Danny was totally endearing nevertheless, and I found all the acting to be excellent. Even the little girl was over the top. Cudos to the cast. Great flick.",1446336000,4,896,4.677215189873418

7075649,4,B00UZJO7UA,"I saw this in the movies and enjoyed it very much. I enjoy Pacino much more as he's gotten older. I always love Annette Benning. As it happens, I know quite a few rockers in the 60 to 70 year old age bracket who have bits of this story as part of their history. It has a few slow passages, but it's a good movie whether you're our age and were there, or younger and still trying to figure us out.",1446249600,,396,3.9012345679012346

I get that it is a bit mellow-dramatic, but the ACTING and the MUSIC and the story is BEAUTIFUL.  Some people really ARE like ""Danny Collins"" and the other characters.  I find each of them full of love in his/her own way. Every character.  Watch this movie and reflect back . . . every character is redeemed.  The movie's thematic background character, John Lennon, embodied and ""imagined"" what this movie delivers:  A vision of hope and love for the world.  This is a very special movie.",1446249600,7,616,4.428571428571429

7075723,4,B00UZJO7UA,"When it comes to casting for a film about an aging rock star, Al Pacino's name doesn't come to mind, or Meryl Streep's either for that matter.  But like Streep in ""Ricki and the Flash,"" Pacino pulls it off.

Pacino's character Danny Collins is still touring, with his new record, ""Greatest Hits 3"" about to be released.  He's had the usual rock `n roll life.  Women, booze, drugs supplemented by great wealth.  He's tired, worn-out, to the point he doesn't even get mad when his 20-something ""fiance"" (Katarina Cas) is caught in his bed with someone more her own age.  For his birthday, Danny's manager, Frank (Christopher Plummer, great) gives him a letter that he bought from a collector.  It turns out that when Danny was just starting out, he gave an interview to an industry magazine.  John Lennon wrote him a letter having read the interview, sending it to the head of the magazine (Nick Offerman).  Rather than pass it on, he kept it, anticipating its value.  Upon his death, the letter was purchased by a collector at an auction.  So now Frank gives the letter to Danny who never knew of its existence.  This part of the film is actually true.

The letter changes Danny's life.  He quits his tour and heads for suburban New Jersey to find his son, Tom (Bobby Cannavale) who he never met.  Tom was the result of a brief liaison with a groupie, and was raised alone by his mother who has died.  Some of the best scenes involve Danny and a Hilton Hotel manager, Mary (wonderful Annette Bening).  She being a more age-appropriate foil for Danny's charming advances, creates some humorous banter that is worth the price of admission.  When Danny shows up unannounced at the front door of Tom's lower middle class home, he is met by his granddaughter, Hope (Giselle Eisenberg) and pregnant wife, Samantha (Jennifer Garner).  Even the bag of bagels Danny brings have a hard time breaking the tension between Danny and his just met daughter-in-law.

As you could anticipate, the film goes through various cycles of the young family rejecting Danny's lifetime absence, then accepting it after Danny gets Hope, who has a learning disability, into a highly regarded school.  Then Danny starts writing songs again and becomes involved more in the life of his son and family.  Then, of course, the movie still has a long way to go, so we can expect a relapse into the old life style, which damages the budding relationship.

In his directorial debut, Dan Fogelman (also wrote the screenplay), has a nice pace and an interesting, if familiar story.  Pacino is a wonder as Danny.  The character has a lot of baggage and appropriate guilt, but as Frank tells Tom in a late scene, ""Danny has a heart of gold, it's just crammed deep into his a**.""  For those looking for something new, this isn't it.  For those looking for a funny but serious film about recovery and redemption, there are a lot worse choices.  The cast is terrific and it's great to see Al Pacino again at the top of his game.  Recommended.

The Blu ray disc has a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The transfer is excellent in all aspects.  Fine, authentic colors, flesh tones and detail.  I could detect no transfer defects.  Everything is first rate.  Audio includes DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 which is also very good.  The film doesn't have a lot of musical scenes (Pacino is no Streep in the singing department) and is more dialog centric.  The dialog is clear and easily understood, even when Pacino's voice goes deeper and a little mumbly.  The overall musical score is quite good and the overall aspect of the audio is very good.  Subtitles include French, Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include only a short ""behind the scenes"" piece and a look at some fake album covers used in the film.",1441843200,2,3771,4.680365296803653

He receives a letter many years overdue from John Lennon that sets him on a journey to try to reconnect with the musician he used to be.  Pacino plays the role with his usual brilliance and creates an anti-hero who the viewer will like and be sympathetic to but will also recognize as a deeply flawed and inadvertently cruel man.

Backup from Plummer, Benning, Cannavale and Garner was perfect, especially Christopher Plummer who stole the show with his likable attitude and wry statements. Very enjoyable from start to finish. Many scenes were pure comic delight as well as moving and well written. The first thing we thought was, ""How the heck did this one slip by? How come we never heard of it?""

7075954,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Two pros, Bening and Pacino, joined by Plummer and Cannavale.  Great performances. This is a nice film, somewhat formulaic, but well acted. The script is well written and each actor adds their own imprint in a such a way that you easily identify with the characters. Nothing phony here. Cannavale is excellent as Pacino's estranged son. This is not a simple film about an aging rock star so don't pass this one up. Staying home and want something entertaining and not too heavy? This one will fill the bill.",1436745600,,507,4.696629213483146

7075976,1,B00UZJO7UA,"Very likeable cast servicing an unfunny and underdeveloped feature.  Everything is working up something that never comes.  And the cancer story, which is intended to give the second half a hook, is contrived and manipulative.  Even the story between Pacino and Bening never really goes anywhere.  Pacino is great, though.  And so is the entire cast.  I really love this screenwriter.  He is capable of much better.  Also a pet peeve: the Hilton product placement in this movie is shameless.  Must we read, see and hear characters endlessly say ""Hilton"" throughout?",1436745600,2,564,5.1098901098901095

7075984,4,B00UZJO7UA,"Fun film, a few twists and turns that thankfully weren't shlocky or predictable and milk toasted down.  Al Pacino is one of our all time, always will be all time, true talents.  The entire cast made you forget you were watching a movie, but instead made you feel like you'd been invited to a long yarn about a family's most heartfelt, even the dark stuff, momentous hallmarks through the years.  It's not sugar coated but doesn't come off so heavy, you feel like lead afterward.  There is so much one off, off the cuff hilarious moments that flit by, you'll want to see it again soon after the first time because you just Know you missed at least half of it.  Witty and poignant without drowning it in saccharine or spoiled it with sour.  Highly Recommend this one.",1436659200,,765,4.507246376811594

7075988,3,B00UZJO7UA,"Al Pacino is a master pro and a joy to watch in most work, he is not plausible here as a rock star and unfortunately I could barely hear him. Something did not work out for me with his singing and musicality. Did not have the showmanship necessary to pull of the rock star cult status he is supposed to have in this film.

A good story illustrating a complicated man with a loving heart. His lack of common sense, self destruction, persistence, generosity illustrates contrast in the human condition.",1436572800,,500,4.555555555555555

This film simultaneously serves as a platform for several kinds of health concerns; ADD in young children, Rare Forms of Blood disorders and something else. Danny Collins, the film, reminded me of a movie from many years ago, with Shirely MacLaine and Jack Nicholson, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT but slightly different. Al Pacino nailed it as an actor in his portrayal of DANNY COLLINS. I would watch it again. It truly deserves a 5 stars ranking.",1436486400,,501,4.837209302325581

Of course if you enter this viewing looking for extreme drama, cliff hangers or in-depth character portrayals this movie is not for you.

This movie had me going on all levels because I love the actors being Annette Bening, Jennifer Garner, Christopher Plummer and Al Pacino.  The subject matter was fascinating to me about an aging rock star with a tie in with the great John Lennon all based on an almost true story.  Also the soundtrack was fantastic using original John Lennon songs as back drop throughout the film!  See it, it has a great Father/Son story interwoven.",1436140800,,557,4.711340206185567

7076024,1,B00UZJO7UA,"There is so little to like about Danny Collins. Drug addict alcoholic that impulsively gives away expensive possessions and comes on to the hotel manager... then uses his money to get to the people he is trying to connect with. Pacino was not right for this part. He would have been better and more believable as the lost 5th ""4 Seasons"" member. ""Hey Baby Doll""? C'mon . There is no way John Lennon could possibly be interested in someone who could do a Sayreville, New Jersey  Holiday Inn lounge knock off of ""Sweet Caroline"". Pacino's voice is so bad singing that poorly written ballad that he made the right decision singing ""Hey Baby Doll"". That title wouldn't fly in any year, now that I think about it. Does Danny really have a heart of gold, or does he just want to have a friend and does flamboyant stuff to get what he wants? I kept waiting to hear ""Sherr-a-ree, Sherry Baby, Sherry, can you come out tonight?""  Of course Pacino can't sing that high.",1435968000,9,959,4.505747126436781

8708820,1,B00UZJO7UA,"I caught this last evening on STARZ where it inexplicably had a 3 star rating.  I similarly can't comprehend its rating on Amazon nor why I masochistically suffered through the whole 2 hours.  This is a real stinker about a bored, cynical, burned out old pop music icon doing nostalgia concert tours just to maintain his lifestyle whose soul is partially rekindled by a previously undiscovered letter written to him by John Lennon (from whom the movie borrows its sound track).  The movie sort of mimics its subject, for this is the kind of movie where old actors who have lost their passion and who are resting on their laurels are calling it in just to make a little cash. Reminiscent of that genre of old star-studded disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure and Towering Inferno.  Nauseating and unbelievable script.  The only bright spot here is the kid who plays Danny's granddaughter.  Otherwise a truly sad effort and a total waste of time.",1499212800,,951,4.803680981595092

8708824,5,B00UZJO7UA,"I did not expect to like this movie.  Rockstar-oriented movies just never appealed to me.  But this is more about aging rockstar Danny Collins (Al Pacino, who can't sing!), an older man trying to make his wrong decisions in the past right.  His manager (Christopher Plummer) gifts him a 40-year-old framed letter written by John Lennon, encouraging the then young Danny Collins to keep striving for his dream.  The manager had kept that letter all these years (This part is based on a true story). This inspires Collins. He's tired of the fame and fortune.  He wants some time alone to settle things and make things right.  He visits his adult married son in New Jersey, whose little daughter Hope (Giselle Eisenberg) has severe ADHD. He spends time in a nearby hotel, managed by Annette Bening who along with everyone else does a stellar job.

All the actors perform brilliantly. Bobby Cannavale plays the reticent son, who slowly warms up to his father.  Jennifer Garner plays the (typical for her) neurotic and stressed out wife Samantha.  Bening as hotel manager Mary Sinclair adds some comedic warmth to the story.

The movie is well-paced.  In the end the story is about how father and son reconnect and are there for each other in a time of need.  I have to admit I got a bit choked up in the end.",1494374400,,1304,4.646288209606987
8708825,5,B00UZJO7UA,"Kudos to the entire cast, the story-line, dialog & etc.,etc.!  For some reason John Lennon's brilliant & timeless music felt more profound than ever before, like it was given new life, it was fresh & crystal clear. Also, it was piped in with precision timing & never felt like his music was being exploited. While I haven't read or heard anything about this flick, I realized at the end that the real Danny Collins was Irish /English therefore I suspect some may take issue w/ a completely Americanized depiction.  Perhaps there's a British version, I'll check.  Anyway, I was so thrilled to find (by happy accident) this most enjoyable little gem! There seems to be an endless sea of unappealing & more often than not, disappointing movies & tv shows, one grows quite weary at the very prospect of sieving through. That said, to finally find some quality viewing was a delightful and rewarding surprise! A final added note; I've never personally been a big Pacino fan but I have to say I'm impressed w/ his willingness to do his own vocals which were about as pitiful as my own. It took guts & a humility I truly felt he did not possess as well as true professionalism!",1491696000,2,1170,4.615384615384615
