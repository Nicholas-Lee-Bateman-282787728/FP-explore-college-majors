8233973,5,B000YRY88O,"Hi,
I really like the power rangers I do hope that they will put all the show on DVD real soon. I think Disney has done a great job on them but what they did with toon disney is real bad they mested it really bad you can't even go into the online TV guide at all and they took power rangers off the air I hope they fixes it real soon and put them back on real soon.

8233974,5,B000YRY88O,"Power Rangers Operation Overdrive is the best series, in fact, all Power Rangers series are the best.  Power Rangers Jungle Fury took me by surprise when the base of operations is a pizza parlor, because pizza is my favorite food.  What also took me by surprise is an upcoming puprle ranger for the first in Power Rangers History.  Purple have been my Favorite color, for as long as I can remember.  I hope Jungle Fury will have 5 volumes that completed the entire series, just like Operation Overdrive.",1212883200,4,503,4.681818181818182
