3628791,5,B001HBT1YC,"This is a timeless classic which every afficionado of the 70s or Key West should own.  The visuals and cinematography are stunning and they convey a certain sense of nostalgia for a bygone era.  This is also amongst the first documentaries that captures the environmental spirit and dangers that haphazardous fishing can cause.

Most of the film is rather zen, with beautiful slow motion spreads of the Tarpon as they jump out of the water.  Interlaced with those moments, you have interviews with various famous fishermen and literary minds and shots of the life and culture of Key West.  The deep Floridian accents can be a little hard to follow at times, but one can't help but appreciate the charming sense of contentment with their surroundings the main protagonists display.

One particularly powerful scene displays a contrast between the style of life these fishermen and friends live in, and the beginning of the commercial touristy aspects of Key West.

Aside from that, the film is very nicely timed in the sense that its not too long and not too short and at the end of the day, one is left with a deeply satisfying experience that isn't spoiled by any modern holywood tradeoffs or forced political messages.",1228435200,8,1220,4.8647342995169085
3628792,5,B001HBT1YC,"Previously only available as a grainy VHS tape made from a chopped up television broadcast, this film has been a cult classic among flyfishermen and literary types for decades, more talked about than seen.  Now, at last!, it is available to all, in glorious color and sound, functioning as a time machine back to a Key West that no longer exists with a cast of literary icons when their careers were just beginning.  The film is beautifully filmed and edited, with a high energy soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet that should keep the Parrotheads buzzing for weeks.  Tarpon contains the only known footage of the late Richard Brautigan, poet and novelist, and has terrific sequences featuring fellow writers Jim Harrison, Tom McGuane and Guy de la Valdene, all of whom have gone on to the stuff of greatness.  Catch and release fly fishing for tarpon and other saltwater fish was in its infancy in the early seventies, the filmmakers accurately capture the mood and spirit of the times and document sustainable fishing practices long before current fashion.  Highly recommended!",1225670400,10,1070,4.98876404494382
8308536,2,B001HBT1YC,"I was disappointed in the lack of more fishing scenes and would have liked to know who the people were in the video, I was only able to identify Jim Harrison and I believe Woody Sexton.  I think the DVD was overpriced as well.",1488240000,,226,4.136363636363637
8308537,4,B001HBT1YC,"If you love Tarpon you will love this video.  I lived in Key West during the time this was shot (1970's).  I was tight with one of the consultants (Capt. Bob Montgomery) and knew the mother of Tom McGuane/mother-in-law of Jimmy Buffett.
The great Tarpon fishery of that era is mostly lost now. Too many guides, too many anglers, too much boat traffic.  Enjoy what some of us took for granted then and would love to see return.",1483228800,,426,4.435897435897436
8308538,5,B001HBT1YC,"best fishing short film ever, a real world snap-shot groovy life in1970's FL Keys. A young Jimmy Buffet plays guitar soundtrack",1434240000,,127,5.095238095238095
8308539,4,B001HBT1YC,Lots of old stuff that is still timely. Great to see some of the vets of the sport on film. Highly entertaining.,1372032000,,112,4.136363636363637
8308540,5,B001HBT1YC,I was there for most of the filming hanging out with Jimmy B and crew... Vaughn Cochran and I were asked to play a little tune on autoharp and washboard... Vaughn went on to become the original Coral Reefer!!,1342483200,2,208,4.358974358974359
8308541,5,B001HBT1YC,"While it is not in the same format/level as some of todays stellar fly fishing films, but this is a great tarpon movie and a step back into 70s Key West.  They do a great job of showing how the island looked, guides of the day, plenty of tarpon shots, and even a look at some of the other fishing techniques of the day.  I felt as if I had stepped back in time with this flick.",1331769600,,377,3.883116883116883
8308542,3,B001HBT1YC,"video got a little dull, but the fishing action is outstanding when its on, also the sound of the reels and the tarpon gill plates clackin are awesome and the envy of any fisherman looking for an up close and personal view of the silver king,also nice to see the helicopter views of the flats in the 70s cameras",1320624000,,311,4.288135593220339
8308543,5,B001HBT1YC,"Incredible documentary film.  The guys that put this thing together were way ahead of their time, both in film production and conservation ideals.  Jimmy Buffett supplies the soundtrack, which will bring tears to they eyes of any Buffett enthusiast.  If you like well filmed 1970s shallow water fly fishing, paired with older Buffett recordings, this film is a must have.",1264032000,,371,5.15
8308544,5,B001HBT1YC,"Really well-done film on flyfishing for tarpon in the Florida Keys in the 1970s.  Contrasted with brief footage of standard, bloody sportsfishing.  Some spectacular footage, with no talking, of tarpon leaping out of the watter.  Some footage of conversations with writers Jim Harrison, Tom McQuane and Richard Brautigan.  A classic!!",1258588800,,333,5.6
8308545,5,B001HBT1YC,"As the back cover states, this film is like the fish itself - a work of art. Set in a time (early 1970's) and place (Key West) that many consider to be the ""real Florida"" (i.e., Paradise Lost), this film is a funky classic that captures the essence of tarpon fishing on the fly. The cinematography is magnificent and the main characters include three of the top American literary talents of the late twentieth century all of whom share a sense of the quasi-religous experience that is tarpon on the fly. The film closes with a compliation of tarpon aerial displays that is reminisenct of the climax of a high end fireworks show - truly worth the price of admission.",1255910400,,665,4.55
