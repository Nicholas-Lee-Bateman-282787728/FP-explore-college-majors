My old copy broke and I am pleased to get a new one.  Normally the majority of my students love this informative video and I've received such positive feedback through the years.  (And yes....I have test questions including a writing component after the fact!)",1402876800,,405,5.2
8167395,5,6304840284,"My favorite of all the National Geographic documentaries, Bali: Masterpiece of the Gods combines fantastic video footage of Balinese life and culture with a flowing, almost meditative musical score that artfully incorporates traditional Balinese Gamelan, and a lyrical narrative that makes for a most enjoyable, informative and memorable viewing. The documentary introduces Bali by recounting the mythological legend of Bali's creation and its historical past, and then works its way through a glimpse into the Balinese cycle of life: an Agama Hindu priest performing the christening of a baby; the daily rituals of village life; a bride-to-be helping her future in-law prepare colorful temple offerings, the importance and integration of art in Balinese life, a temple festival that surreally entwines religious devotion with the supernatural, the union of a young couple in marriage, and the familial obligation of the cremation ritual for the departed. The beauty of Bali is captured in scenes of terraced rice paddies, ancient temples amid lush mountains, a scenic ocean sunset, intricate paintings and woodcarvings, and the face of a young girl transformed into a court princess for a classical dance performance. If you are intrigued by the cultures of Southeast Asia, this enchanting video is well worth the investment; I will definitely place Bali high on the list of places to visit during future trips to Asia.",1154044800,5,1420,5.400900900900901
