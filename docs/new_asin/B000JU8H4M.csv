8152982,3,B000JU8H4M,"Bought as a gift.  Feedback is so so. Two DVDs about zombies.
Dead Riot is zombies in a women prison. In the end, only one escapes from death.  She lucky.  Shower scene is there.  Not erotic though.
The second one, Flesh for the Beast is vampires in a castle. These vampires eat flesh and intestine.  Horror not to be taken seriously.
Sex scenes are for laughs.  Why?  A fully naked woman is making love with a fully clothed man.  Researchers unfortunate.",1490140800,,455,4.530864197530864

8152984,3,B000JU8H4M,"The promoter of the DVD thought it would be a great idea to take these two films and make them look old by washing out the color and running lines through them. They added some Drive-in movie trailers which added to the nudity and some food ads which added to my gut. There is also an optional grindhouse feature so you listen to yahoos make comments during the movie in case you wanted the feel of being with someone while watching softcore slasher porn. Not as good as MST. Dead Riot is clearly the superior of the two films, and one you might want to find alone instead.

DEAD RIOT:
The film begins with Tony Todd as Shadow in prison awaiting to be put to death for countless crimes of murder and rape. His teeth are honed into points. During his execution some supernatural stuff happens and a prison riot ensues. Todd and the corpses of his inmates are place in a mass grave....

We now flash forward 20 years to the present. It is now a woman's prison complete with a sadistic lesbian guard (Andrea Langi), shower scene, horny doctor and the new tough girl, Solitaire. Solitaire ends up in solitaire where she touches a carving in the floor made by Todd. She has visions of the ghastly images of his crimes including the torture and killing of a pregnant woman. Misty Mundae (credited as Erin Brown) plays Crystal, the prison girlfriend of Mondo, Solitaire's nemesis.

When blood is spilled on the ground where Todd is buried...all zombie hell breaks loose.

occasional f-bomb, minor sex, lesbian themes, full frontal nudity (only when tasteful and necessary for the plot), girls with tramp stamps, a baby from ""It's Alive"" (they wanted to make sure everything was covered) excessive blood and gore. Grindhouse cult classic. Deleted scenes include tasteful extended shower scenes. Not for everyone. A Misty Mundae prison girl zombie film, a must for discriminating collectors.

FLESH FOR THE BEAST:
A group of paranormal investigators check out a haunted brothel. They divide up meet a demon/ghost that treats them to their sexual fantasy and then eats them. Pretty much it. Something about an amulet too. Terrible film all around especially the masks. 3 stars for the full frontal nudity.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, nudity (Jane Scarlett of ""Satan's Schoolgirls"", Caroline Hoermann, Barbara Joyce of ""Satan's School for Lust"", Ruby LaRocca who is in many Misty Mundae films)",1388707200,2,2385,4.862068965517241
8152985,1,B000JU8H4M,"The movie ""Dead Riot"" already seems to be a movie with a grindhouse feel to it, but this DVD release if the film is totally ruined by what the dvd states as the ""grindhouse experience"".  This ""experience"" is no more than what Rodriguez's ""Planet of Terror"" does.  Which means there is post-madescratches, audio loss, and a missing scenes.  This has been done by this DVD release and not by the creators.  You can also enjoy this film with a ""grind house audience"".  This DVD company, like Rodriguez, has no idea what a grindhouse film is.  A grindhouse film is a cheaply made product because the creators wanted to make something, but didn't have the money to make it with all the bells and whistles.  That is why the prints of the old were scratchy, and missing a few scenes, because the film was placed on a more cheaper material and damaged easier.  Just because the production company can ""grind"" out several hundred films a year doesn't mean that the makers didn't have heart for these hastily made films.

These two films has a lot of heart in it and it shows through the schlock the DVD company added.  I really dislike when a production company censors a film because they think they know what's best.  The only good thing about this is the old trailers that they show.  I am buying this movie without the cuts and not buying any more of this DVDs company ""grindhouse experience,"" and you should do the same.",1378339200,,1416,4.553359683794467
