2475694,2,B000DZ95NK,"First off, I was never lucky enough to see the original 1960's Soupy Sales series but grew up during (and enjoyed) the 70's revival.  When I first read about this set I was looking forward to it but found myself a bit disappointed that for a 3 DVD set the content was so limited.

Between 3 discs you get just 4 shows from the 70's series and only two segments from the original 60's run, the Frank Sinatra - Sammy Davis Jr. restaurant skit and the stripper at the door(no image blocking here!) blooper.

If you're a Soupy Sales fan, think about it.  The shows were fun I just wish there had been more included or at least it should have been released as a 1 disc collection so expectations weren't so high.",1139011200,7,707,4.293233082706767
2475695,5,B000DZ95NK,"I am 73 as I write this, and have loved Soupy since my UCLA college days in the late 50's and 60's, and especially his revival
shows on TV around the mid 80,s, which makes up most of this collection.  Of course the real credit must go to Clyde Adler,
whose puppetry and front door routines often were taken for granted.  Best to watch a half hour or so at a time, so it doesn't
seem repetitious.  I have all the DVD's available and this is among the best.",1393027200,,455,4.089887640449438

2475697,3,B000DZ95NK,"A lifelong Soupy Sales fan, I was thrilled to finally meet him at the bar in a club he was playing in the '80s and then again several years later when he played the Comedy Club in L.A.  When I first met him, Soupy sadly told me how he and Metromedia each owned a 50% share in the shows he shot at Channel 5 in New York (his most famous programs).  After he ended that series to make movies for Columbia -- and only got to make one cheapie (""Birds Do It"") he had no control over -- TV went all color and his B&W episodes were withdrawn from syndication. Soupy didn't worry though, because his contract with Metromedia stated that after a few years 100% ownership of that material would revert to him.  However, on the day he went to Metromedia to pick up his tapes, they told him they had erased ALL of them.  That meant that all that remained of his Metromedia shows were a few odd reels he happened to have copies of (such as the Frank Sinatra appearance).  Soupy was brokenhearted that his best material seemed lost forever -- but wait.  What he did not realize then was that while his show was still in syndication, not all TV stations had video playback equipment.  For those stations, Metromedia made KINESCOPE prints by pointing a film camera at a TV monitor.  Over the latter part of his life, more and more of those kinescope versions of his Metromedia shows emerged from collector's archives and wound up in Soupy's possession. He formed a company called Soupbone to represent that property.  That's how the Soupy Sales ""In Living Black and White"" DVD set was compiled.  Yes, most of Soupy's best work IS lost -- but there still are surviving prints of a good sampling of his classic B&W Metromedia shows -- the program on which he introduced ""The Mouse.""
As far as this set goes, yes, it is comprised almost entirely of the color remakes of his old material (plus some new stuff) he shot at Golden West Broadcasters in L.A. in the `70s.  One key reason why he made those shows was to be able to leave SOMETHING behind.  It was only later that Soupy discovered, to his delight, the kinescope versions of at least some of his very best series.",1324339200,3,2151,4.431472081218274

2475704,2,B000DZ95NK,"The description on Amazon does not mention that the bulk of this collection is from the NEW Soupy Sales Show and while some of the old spark is there, it's still not the fast-paced laugh riot that was the hallmark of a very funny show of the late 50's and 60's. I see that others have noted that those shows are simply not available because of some short-sighted people who erased, let's face it, DESTROYED, the earlier work of this comic genius. However, the liner notes by Marino Amoruso, talk about archives in Iron Mountain and say, ""My colleagues and I took a golf cart to a designated area where we were able to examine THE ENTIRE SOUPY SALES COLLECTION."" The notes continue stating that, ""In total there were 180 Soupy episodes, the EARLY ONES on film and the later ones on various formats of video tape."" So, according to the person who put this collection together, there is STILL lots of material and, I fervently hope, that it will become available sometime in the future. I am going to attempt to contact the producers of this collection and get the straight scoop. In the meantime if anyone has any new information, please add it to this forum. These memories MUST be kept alive if at all possible.

2475708,1,B000DZ95NK,"The first question is ""What Whole Gang?""  I received three DVDs
with two episodes on each DVD.  Talk about false advertising.
Had I not waited so long I would have sent it back.  You'd be
better off with Soupy Sales: In Living Black & White.  I don't think
it fair to advertise ""The Whole Gang"" when in actuality you see less
than half. I'm not blaming Amazon.com - after all it's not their
fault but I do hold the marketing people to be honest and up
front with what they advertise.  Amazon should pull this item
from their inventory of items available or at least insert a disclaimer
telling shoppers that there are only 2 featurettes per DVD. Had I known this I would not have bought the 3 disc set. Another question is why spread 6 programs on 3 DVDs when all of them could fit
on one?  Although it's difficult to prove I feel that I was deceived into thinking I was getting my moneys worth. Shame!!!! Shame!!!! Shame!!!!",1186876800,9,925,4.380116959064328

Charismatic as Soupy Sales is, however, it is hard to watch these shows for too long on account of their extremely corny, poorly written comedy skits. WIsh they had provided Soupy with good writers back then instead of letting him, apparently, wing it on his own, often with the most embarassingly bad jokes and puns. Once and a while they provide a good laugh, however. Soupy does light up the screen.",1178928000,2,576,4.6568627450980395

2475715,5,B000DZ95NK,"The only thing really, that's wrong with this set is that there isn't enough of it.  Sure, it's three disks, yet there's only one episode on each disk (plus an extra).  But-- it's not expensive (though they probably could have saved some money in its production if they'd put it all on one disk). -- UPDATE:  it wasn't expensive, until it went out of print, sorry...

The real problem is, there just *isn't* as much of the best Soupy in existance as most of us fans would like-- it's now only in the ether-- left for aliens to enjoy on their TVs millions of years from now when our first TV signals finally reach them.

It's a crime that much of the early '60s shows were erased, but there's nothing that can be done about that.  This collection, though all from the ""new soupy sales show"" from the '70s/'80s-- is still a pretty darn good representation of even the early shows-- all the signature elements are here-- fang, pookie, listening to the weather, words of wisdom, an endless stream of characters that you never actually see showing up at the door, conversations with the offscreen staff, and of course the PIES.  And I found this set every bit as funny as I remembered.  If you love Soupy Sales, this is as good as it's gonna get-- unless you get reincarnated as one of those aliens I was referring to.  Frankly, I didn't want to wait for that, so I bought this set and am happy with what little I can get of a true genius in the early TV medium.  Kovacs was a TV genius too, and I have his shows which are also very funny, but I wouldn't trade them for this set.  There's just something about the way Soupy made it work with such a minimal set of elements-- and how totally loose the whole thing was-- Soupy cracking up and his off-the-cuff remarks were a really big part of what made it work (that and fang's dialog-- I never get tired of that and there's plenty on this set).

With regards to the commercials-- I don't mind them at all-- in fact, it appears they may not be the original ones but picked because the are unique too-- Andy Warhol for Braniff, bad boy Matt Dillon for Milk, etc...  but I'm a fan of old commercial collections as well and have an antique TV that I like to watch this stuff on so it's perfect IMHO...

So, I can find no fault with this set and give it fully 5 stars.  It's about the best that will ever be available of Soupy and I'll take what I can get.  I've got the B&W set too, and cherish that as well...

Soupy, if you read this-- I love you and give you a big kiss...",1163289600,29,2516,4.241090146750524

2475717,3,B000DZ95NK,After buying this DVD and viewing it I was very disappointed about the production. There was an indication from reading all the production notes that there were hours and hours of material to use. I found that this DVD was very limited in material and what is with all the commercials. I didn't like commercials then and I don't like them now. While Soupy was brilliant the people who put this DVD together do not seem to be very professional. You can't miss with Soupy but this was a very short DVD that could have contained much more content. please do a better job next time and lose the commercials.,1153612800,,603,4.490909090909091

2475719,4,B000DZ95NK,"I, too, would give my eye-teeth to see the older Soupy Sales shows of my youth - I don't really remember watching the ""New"" show. Back when Pookie whistled rather than spoke, the less polished version of Soupy's genius, etc. It breaks my heart to hear so much of that was erased. That being said, I'll take anything I can find of Soupy's shows and be content. This DVD collection has many priceless moments and even if the humor is not 21st century, Soupy Sales was a part of my youth, a part of my teaching about humor. DVDs like these are more likely released for the folks who grew up in the 50's, 60's and 70's, and gives them back some of their memories. The fact that networks did not think shows like this worth saving makes it all the more important that what is left be released. Baby-boomers, buy this and enjoy!",1147478400,9,822,4.3441558441558445
2475720,4,B000DZ95NK,"...let me start by saying that ""The New Soupy Sales Show"" (which is what almost all of this collection is based on) is an extremely funny set of skits, riffs, and humorous repartee' from one of the giants of children's shows from the '70s and early '80s.

The only major complaint that I have with this set is that there is borderline false advertising regarding the inclusion of ORIGINAL material from this comic genius.  If the buyer doesn't read the description on the back of the DVD carefully, he or she might believe that this DVD set contains material from Soupy's late '50s and '60s children's show.  It actually contains very little (with the exception of a great skit from the original show that includes Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and Trini Lopez).  Tragically, most of the original show has been erased and will never be available for viewing again.

Another concern deals with the inclusion of what is one of the funniest outtakes in TV history....Soupy's visit by a backstage stripper.  If the viewer has seen footage of this on some of the Dick Clark ""Bloopers"" shows on television over the years, they would know that the viewer only sees what's in front of the set and how it unnerves Soupy.  This DVD contains the actual ""stripper footage"" from the BACK of the set that exposes the well-endowed dancer in all of her glory.  Not for viewing by children!  (Soupy's reaction to the prank is PRICELESS, though!)

With all of this being said, let me close by saying that this DVD set is certainly worth the price I paid for it.  Soupy Sales was a comic genius and his good-natured puns and humor never tire.  He appeared to love his work and often times ""cut himself up"" with what he was saying or what was going on around him.  One can't watch these 3 disks without laughing out loud!

RECOMMENDED for fans of the old show!",1147046400,68,1841,4.590214067278287
2475721,5,B000DZ95NK,"While I would love to see more classic 60's Soupy (as I've seen a few eps at the Museum of TV & Radio in Beverly Hills) it was nice to watch the Legend Himself, probably the most fearless man in comedy, doing what he does best.

It's a shame there isn't a show like this on the air now.

If you want to entertain yourself and treat your kids to what is REALLY funny, buy this set.  And buy the ones that come out after it.  Thanks, Soupy.",1143158400,6,438,3.9431818181818183

(Winchell won $6 million against ABC for this since he owned the rights to the show and ABC had ""better uses"" for the show-for news use).  There is very little of the original series remaining from filmed archives.

I miss Blacktooth from the original show but The New Soupy Sales show was just as funny (contrary to most commentators). I saw the old show and the new show.  I would pay big bucks for a complete set of the 78 or so 1977-8 series.

What appealed to me most is that Soupy appeared to actually enjoy doing what he did best--making people laugh. This collection is guaranteed to do just that.

Brilliant stuff and just like I remember - it was the way Soupy played to the audience that made kids like me love him.  He didn't look down at us - he kept us in on the jokes!

Another cool thing about this DVD was the commercials that came with it.  They seemed original like they came with the show - it really gave me a sense of the era.

The other very cool thing is Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. getting a pie in the face.  Watching it with some older friends told me the episode had to be around '64 or '65 and they (knowing Soupy better than I did back then) said they thought that was the famous ""lost Soupy episode"".  I can't believe I saw it.  Very cool.  Truly.

Funniest bit in the whole DVD - Alice Cooper walking in on a piano playing bug!

That's the one I showed my teenage daughters - and they loved it, and then they actually showed it to their friends!  It's interesting to see if Soupy can transcend generations the way Charlie Chaplin and Jerry Lewis did.

Unfortunately I was disappointed in the extreme.

The DVD content is overwhelmingly comprised of material from the remake, which aired in the 70's. The truly ground breaking work done in the 60's was almost completely absent. To make matters worse a series of 70's commercials are played at full length taking up precious time. I did not want a retrospective of 70's commercials. There was little if any entertainment value associated with the commercial content.

My advice, if you are a Soupy Sales fan and long for the brilliant spontaneous shows of the 60's the very episodes which often resulted in Soupy being fined and taken of the air, then do not order this DVD set.",1140134400,11,793,4.773722627737226
2475733,1,B000DZ95NK,"I grew up watching The Soupy Sales Show on ABC in Los Angeles. I had the record, and I have the guitar songbook. If you ask me, I can play and sing ""I'm A Singer Without A Song"" and ""Hippy's Cha Cha Hips"". I've been on the hunt for tapes of the 60s shows since VHS was in its infancy. I know my Soupy.

Back in the late 80s, Rhino came out with three tapes of the Soupy Sales show. They were kind of skimpy on the running time- each one had two episodes... one original 60s B&W show and one of the lukewarm late 70s remakes. But considering how long it had been since I had seen the show, I was satisfied with them.

I was thrilled when I heard that Soupy was finally being given a DVD release, especially since Ernie Kovacs and Sid Caesar have had such great DVD retrospectives. I hoped that this would be just as good, with a higher ratio of B&W to 70s remake. The cover really excited me... there was Soupy singing The Mouse!

Unfortunately, this three DVD set has LESS than the three Rhino tapes did in every way possible... Soupy doesn't sing The Mouse anywhere on this set, the original theme song isn't here either. There's only a measley ten minutes of footage from the classic 60s Soupy Sales Show, and the DVDs have shorter running times than the VHSs did. In fact, the running time is so short, they could have easily fit everything here on a single DVD.

This set was produced by Marino Amoruso. In the liner notes, he goes on and on about how he viewed hours and hours of material to select the absolute best of Soupy Sales. Amoruso should be pelted with pies for cheating Soupy Sales fans shamelessly. Soupy Sales deserves a REAL DVD release with the REAL Soupy Sales Show. I don't care if they are only in fuzzy kinescopes or glitchy two inch videotape. The footage exists. Give me the real deal, and put two hours on each disk fer cryin' out loud.

By the way, The Whole Gang is NOT here. Hippy does not appear anywhere on these disks. I'm writing the company that made this set and requesting that they do it right next time.",1139616000,44,2042,4.27979274611399
2475734,5,B000DZ95NK,"I grew up watching and loving the Soupy Sales show, both in the 60's and the 70's.  After purchasing and watching this box set a few months ago I was surprised to find that, viewing the show from today's perspective, the one thing that jumped out at me the most was the genuine love and kindness that emanated from the man and his show.  Although his humor bordered on the ""naughty,"" it was a kind and gentle humor, unlike what passes for humor today, which is really nothing more than bitchy, ego-crushing sarcasm.  I suppose there are people who would say that today's humor is more ""real,"" but I would argue that love is no less real than hate, peace is no less real than war, compassion is no less real than cruelty, but genuine talent is a lot more real than what passes for talent today.

I noticed the same thing watching the Howdy Doody DVD I recently purchased.  There was a genuine kindness and sincerity to the show, and a quality in the writing that respected and nurtured the incipient intelligence of their young viewers.  That's why people are so nostalgic for the ""good old days.""  Because they really were good--at least they were a hell of a lot better than they are today.",1139097600,8,1191,4.486111111111111

8102858,3,B000DZ95NK,"This is fun overall, especially for Soupy fans but not high quality videos.
Sketches and extras are well chosen, each disc is about an hour total.
Most material is from color episodes.
Quality is Public Domain, not restored and looks like VHS videotape overall.
If I had it to do over again I would wait for a better release, but this is fun.",1513382400,,342,4.444444444444445

8102860,5,B000DZ95NK,"I grew up watching these shows in the 50's & 60's  after school and his lunchtime 15 minute programs as well. These unrehearsed shows are a scream especially when you hear the stage crew crack up laughing in the background at Soupy's antics and the jokes they played on him. Also, the episode with the naked lady on camera is a plus! That got him fired & canceled but it wasn't his fault -- thanks to his prankster stage crew once again. Each episode features someone knocking on the door and then SURPRISE! Also, every episode featured someone getting a pie in the face, mostly Soupy but he had special guests as well that got it smack in the puss! Too funny! The naked stripper the crew had there shocked Soupy and the TV audience as well! These were live shows remember, and what happens, mistakes and all, got broadcasted. You'll see his puppet friends: White Fang, Black Tooth the dogs, (you only see their paws) and Pookie the Lion and his theatrical productions. A funny bit is listening to the weather on an old-time radio. Pay close attention because the announcer does some satire on events back in the days of the 50's and early 60's. Everybody do the MOUSE! Soupy had a hit single and LP in the late 50's that spawned a dance called the Mouse, it is on here as well. I almost forgot about that. All in all, a fun collection. I do not recommend watching the naked lady bit with your kids, but the rest is fine for the whole family. Soupy was a unique comic in his day. RIP Soupy.",1483228800,,1490,4.379061371841155

The Soupy Sales Collection is a set of three DVDs featuring selected sketches from his 1979 series revival, The ""New"" Soupy Sales show, with the only additional ""special features"" being scenes of Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. being hit with pie and the ""naked lady"" prank his production staff pulled on him.  Interspersed among the sketched are commercials from (what I think) are the mid-60's to late-80's.

In so many ways the DVD production was either or both bare bones or barely thought out - I can excuse the simple menus if the contents were uniform but what starts outs as a television episode is edited into a 45 minute DVD that just boggles the mind in its presentation.  It seems that somewhere in the development hell what a supposed to be a simple transfer of episodes turned into be a ""best of"" montage by someone who had no idea who Soupy Sales was or the expectations of what a ""collection"" should be.

In general, its great introduction into Soupy Sales if you have never heard of him.  If you have memories of watching him on television, you will be disappointed.  As of June 2014, Retro Television (RTV) seems to have rerun the entire 1979 series and selected episodes of the 1965 WNEW series, presenting soupy as he should be.",1395619200,,1516,4.568265682656826
