3610875,1,B001GE2CFK,"What I Dislike about This Version is When Lady Chatterley went to Meet Her Lover she Did Not wear any Stockings on but instead went Bare Legged.  ( Yuck)

  I Like the Later versions Better for the later version did Feature Stockings On Lady Chatterley Which I Like Better.  Skip this Version & Try The Version Starring Sylvia Kristel made in 1981 or 1982.",1343088000,2,356,4.5

3610877,3,B001GE2CFK,"This DVD is issued by Mad Phat Enterprises (amadphat) whose products usually state, ""licensed by Video Yesteryear, plastic case, no artwork."" The discs are dubs from VHS cassettes whose sources are unrestored 16mm films for classroom use, having only a single projector. Thus midway in the DVD, a screen appears: ""Please wait while we change reels.""

A diehard foreign-film buff can still appreciate this updating of Lawrence's post-WWI novel to 1955, as evidenced by Danielle Darrieux's (Lady Chatterley) dresses. Leo Genn (rich Lord Chatterley) is wheelchair-bound owing to war injury; as the insensitive owner of the coal mine, he is disliked by the citizenry. His wife has accommodated to the impossibility of sexual congress, but one evening he shocks her by saying he wants her to have a child (to become the Lord's property) by a worthy man of her own choosing. But that's not at all a prompting when she encounters the estate caretaker Mellors (Erno Crisa) at his woodland domicile, and they begin a sexual relationship (he is separated from his troublesome wife). By the time she becomes pregnant by him, she feels strongly linked to him, in the flesh, in the soul. Independent Mellors loves her but makes no claim on her. But the Lady faces up to the Lord, walks out on him, and walks away with Mellors to his new employer.

The strong dramatization of the novel undoubtedly owes a good bit to an earlier stage play by two French coauthors. The casting targets French, English, and Italian audiences. Darrieux's performance is, like, enervated--let the camera do the work. Genn's distinctive timbre and pattern of English delivery are carried over into his French, to curious effect. Erno Crisa (short life: 1924-1968) may have Italian blood, and many of his 50 films were made in Italy, but actually he was born in Tunisia and speaks French fluently. The present role seems to be his best, and indeed it is he who energizes the picture.",1283558400,7,1947,4.932926829268292

8305136,4,B001GE2CFK,"I WAS EXPECTING ""RISQUE"" BUT THIS IS NOT AS MUCH ""RISQUE"" AS IT WAS GOOD LITERATURE: THIS IS NOT JUST A NOVEL: THIS IS A TRUE STORY IN THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE, FOR SURE.  IT IS A STORY.  IT HAS LOGIC AND REASONING AND IT ALSO HAS: ""FOOLISH HUSBAND WHO TOOK HIS WIFE FOR GRANTED BECAUSE SHE WAS KIND AND DUTIFUL.""  ALL WHICH IS TRUE IN LIFE.  THIS STORY COULD HAVE BEEN (OR IS) IN THE BIBLE AS A STORY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN LIFE.

I DIDN'T WANT TO READ THE BOOK (TO CHECK POINTS) BUT I DO LIKE THIS PRESENTATION AND WISH I COULD BUY AN EDITED VERSION OF IT FOR MY LIBRARY.  BUT THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE YET.

SOMEONE SUGGESTED IN THEIR REVIEW THAT ""THIS VERSION"" WAS THE BEST OF ALL THE REST....(AND IT IS).  IT HAS A STORY)

I BOUGHT ANOTHER TO WATCH ONLINE: ""THE LOVERS OF LADY CHATTERLEY"" AND IT WAS STRAIGHT UP ""PORN""...NOTHING BUT CHEAP PORN, REALLY CHEAP, CHEAP PORN: NO TALENT, NO STORY: THE HUSBAND WAS SUPPOSE TO BE CRIPPLE...BUT HE WAS  JUST WALKING AROUND  NORMALLY WITH A CANE.  THERE WAS NOTHING BUT EXPLICIT BODY PARTS.  (I WAS INCENSED BY THIS....(i asked for my money back: i perused this 1.5hr movie in 12 mins by moving it via ""fast forward"" trying to see if there ever was a story.  And there was never a story.  I'M NO PROOD: I KNOW WHAT PORN IS AND I KNOW WHAT IT ISN'T: IT ISN'T GOOD, CLASSIC, FULFILLING LITERATURE... I AM AN ANTI-PORN ACTIVIST NOW BECAUSE I  HATE IT THAT PORN IS BEING SET-IN WITH FAMILY MOVIES AND ""CLASSIC-LITERATURE""
VIDEOS.

I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE COMMENTS HERE OVER WHETHER THE ""LADY"" SHOULD HAVE ''WORN STOCKINGS'' TO MEET HER LOVER TO LITERALLY ROLL IN WHAT LOOKED LIKE A PILE OF HAY ....IN A BARN-LOOKING CABIN; BUT SHE LEFT HER STOCKINGS DELIBERATELY IN THIS MOVIE AND HER LOVER WAS SURPRISED AND STATED: ""UH...YOU DON'T HAVE NO PANTIES ON.."" SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  NOW THAT IS LITERATURE; NOW THAT IS REAL BETWEEN A MAN AND HIS WOMAN AND THAT IS ""NAUGHTY GIRL""...THAT IS NOT EXPLICIT, RAW AND RAUNCHY.  THEY DID NOT GO TO FAR IN THIS MOVIE APPARENTLY FOLLOWING THE BOOK.

THE WHOLE GOAL OF THE AUTHOR APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN 'TANTALIZINGLY"" RISQUE, NOT ""EXPLICIT"" RAW AND RAUNCHY AND NOTHING LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION: PORN.  I TEACH PORN EQUALS: ""EMPTY CALORIES""...ONE CONSUMES PORN AND HAS NO FOOD.

THERE WAS BIG-TIME LOVE, BIG -TIME DEVOTION AND THE WIFE TOOK HER STAND WITH A TRUE MORAL COMPASS.
THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM PORN.  PORN IS EMPTY CALORIES.  NO FOOD.  NO NOURISHMENT.  NO NUTRITION.

*THIS PRODUCTION DEMONSTRATES WHAT A WOMAN NEEDS AND WANTS FROM HER MAN AND THIS PARTICULAR WOMAN IS SHOWN GETTING IT IN HER LIFE AND FIGHTING FOR ITS FULFILLMENT.  THIS MOVIE DOES THE WORK OF A CLASSIC: IT GIVES THE YOUNG PEOPLE SOMETHING TO LOOK AT, SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AND LEARN.

BUT WHAT IS TANTALIZING ABOUT THIS STORY (FOR ALL TIMES) IS THAT HER HUSBAND IS INJURED; HIS LEGS WERE INJURED, SO, HE PROPOSITIONED HIS WIFE WHO WAS TOTALLY IN A SPIRITUALLY SACRED AND SACRIFICING ZONE IN HER MIND AND SOUL AND SHE WAS GOING ABOUT BEING THE DUTIFUL WIFE WITH NO ILL-WILL OR ANGER IN HER DISPOSITION....WHEN HE SUGGESTED THAT SHE GO TO VENICE WITH HER SISTER AND FIND A SUITABLE LOVER TO MAKE HER PREGNANT AND HOPEFULLY WITH A SON AND HE WOULD CLAIM THAT SON AS HIS OWN.
SHOCKING????  WELL.  I CAN'T FIND IT SO AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE.  BUT THEN...I CORRECT MYSELF: ONE IS ALWAYS SHOCKED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ""SUPPOSE"" TO DO SUCH THINGS AND DOES THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE RICH AND POWERFUL.

IN MODERN TIMES IT IS JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY.  A STORY ABOUT A WOMAN WHO HAD SETTLED AND ACCEPTED
THE REALITY OF A BROKEN-INJURED  HUSBAND THAT WOULD NEVER GIVE HER PASSION IN  HER LIFE AGAIN (IF HE EVER DID).
SHE CHOSE TO WALK AWAY FROM WEALTH TO A NORMAL, REGULAR LIFE WITH A MAN SHE LOVED, DESIRED AND RESPECTED.
SHE DECIDED TO HAVE A FAMILY TOGETHER WITH THIS MAN...; WHILE HER HUSBAND WANTED HER TO DO SOMETHING UNTHINKABLE.
WELL PERFORMED; THE CHARACTERS WERE UNDERSTANDABLE,  EVEN UNFORGETTABLE.
*ALL IN ALL...A WOMAN WAS ""CONTENTED"" WITH HER LIFE WITH HER HUSBAND.  BUT IT WAS HER HUSBAND WHO TOLD HER TO
GO AND HAVE SOME PASSION ....AND TO HIS SHOCK SHE DID THAT.  AND THEN, LEFT HIM FOR HER PASSIONATE ONE.",1473811200,2,4153,4.523489932885906
