3048840,5,B0010F8JFM,"lovedddddddd it! It was an incredibly well done video and the most important thing, the instruction, was also the best thing about it. The video is set up like this: there are about 25 moves in total, including transition moves. Each move starts out with the dancers demonstrating the move first, lasting about thirty seconds or so. Then the lead begins with a very detailed explanation where she breaks everything down, body part by body part. Her pointers were extremely effective and she's great at anticipating what you would be struggling with. Each move is about 5 minutes long and Nicole shows you the move from the front as well as the back. The camera angles were very professional and the close-ups were definitely useful. Oh did I mention they were wearing heels? Yes, these hot dance moves are possible in four inch heels! Finally, each section is wrapped up by the girls showing you the move full speed one last time and giving you last minute pointers. You may have to rewind some of the more difficult moves several times, but it's almost scary to see yourself improve. I started seeing changes almost immediately after I bought the video and my moves became smoother in no time.",1198800000,75,1194,4.7451923076923075
3048841,5,B0010F8JFM,"Well done ladies! Moves are hot and explanations easy to follow. I definitely recommend this video to any girl who wants to learn to dance. I hope ""Girls Night Out"" is just as good.",1197763200,5,181,4.352941176470588
3048842,5,B0010F8JFM,"A friend of mine who I usually go out with always asks me to teach her some of my dance moves but I'm never really able to do it effectively.  So for a Christmas gift I decided I'd buy her an instructional dance video.  I decided to get a copy for myself as well.  These girls really know how to move and the lead instructor is a very good teacher.  I bought a dance workout video in the past, and while the fitness element was good, the moves were really cheesy and I would never in a thousand years use them in a nightclub.  This DVD, however, is a complete 180 degrees.  It teaches sexy dance moves that I can totally see myself using.  The moves are sexy and flirty, sometimes overstepping just the right amount into ""edgy"", without ever making you wonder what another girl would think of your dancing.  Now that's not an easy feat.",1197244800,17,836,4.280254777070064
3048843,5,B0010F8JFM,"The product description is actually amazingly close to the real thing! You almost never see that these days.  Sexy Moves For The Club is a two disc set.  The first DVD is about 100 minutes long and only has the instruction.  The instruction is definitely really good.  All three ladies on the cover are instructors in the video although only one of them does most of the talking, the one in the center.  They all really know what they're doing though and they all differ a bit in their styles - which is good since you get to pick the one you want to copy.  Each lesson is about 5 minutes long and is incredibly detailed.  The section on transitions is very useful as well.  By transitions, they mean a short spin or dance move that you can do in between the other dance moves to switch between them.  They actually show you four different transitions and they're all pretty good.

The second DVD has the Bonus Workout as well as some other special features.  The Bonus Workout is 15 minutes long and is actually pretty good.  They don't say anything while they lead the workout and let the music do the talking - which is actually great because I hate it when fitness instructors have too much motivational talk.  Pop-ups throughout the workout give you different tips and announce how much time you have left.  The other special features are a Bio page (these girls have danced with some seriously famous people), and something called Instructors In The Club which shows how each of the instructors would dance in a club using the moves from the video.

Overall, what an exceptional product!  One of the best instructional videos I've seen for sure.",1196812800,61,1651,4.583617747440273
3048844,5,B0010F8JFM,"Fabulous DVD! I wasn't sure what to expect because I didn't see any reviews when I bought this DVD but it really exceeded my expectations.  Great instruction, beautiful instructors, sexy dance moves, cool location and a hot soundtrack that just makes you want to shake it.  I'm used to something being missing in a product but I haven't been able to find it here.  Everything you would expect from a high-budget Hollywood production.

I liked the moves, and the presentation was good. My only complaint was that it did go a little fast for a first-time dancer like me.",1399248000,3,273,4.169811320754717
3048854,4,B0010F8JFM,"I would have given this 5 stars except for the music, which is a few very boring, repetitive songs on loops the entire time. Maybe they chose that so the viewer wouldn't be distracted and could instead focus just on the dance moves, I don't know.

Anyway, the lead instructor is adorable, and gives very good cues. She breaks every move down first by going slowly and explaining it, then breaks it apart even more by focusing on the various body parts involved. Then, they quicken the pace and show it at regular speed. I think they spend just enough time on each move. Some reviewers have complained that they don't break it down enough, or that you need prior experience to learn moves. I disagree. If they spent more time with each move, the video would be way too long! That's the whole point of a video...you can watch it over and over and practice on your own and then watch their explanations again. Don't expect yourself to be perfect at it on the first viewing. Take your time, have fun.

The moves are indeed very sexy. Some, I've seen friends do over the years (like the body roll), and always wondered...how do they DO that!? I thought they were just magically born with the ability. :-) Others, are more on the trampy side, like exotic dancing. I personally may not do them, but still like to know them, as even just incorporating a few seconds of a really sexy move can spice up your night. :-)

This video requires so much lower body strength that even if you're just going through the video slowly, stopping and rewinding to get the moves down, you WILL USE and strengthen your legs. Lots of bending knees squating while rolling and swinging the hips type of stuff. Great core and leg workout, and I thought my legs were already pretty strong.

One other complaint...one of the backup dancers is HORRIBLE. It's distracting. She's not tight with her movements and just overall looks sloppy and trampy. It's one thing to look cute and sexy, it's another to look tacky, cheap, and easy. And I am no prude. But I just try to not focus on her too much and stay focused on the lead girl, who somehow manages to teach sexy dance moves and remain approachable and classy. :-) I feel bad saying that, but honestly, it's so bad that if they make more of these videos, they should remove her. Or somehow get her to tighten up her moves. Maybe they have her there to show all levels, and make the rest of us not feel bad if we look awful at first too? :-/

Overall, definitely recommend, I'm really enjoying this video!",1394668800,2,2523,4.464208242950108
3048855,4,B0010F8JFM,it was fun to do. i wanted dance dvd's for the work out. i like to dance but have no moves lol so it has been fun learning a few basic moves and a good reason to get off the couch and get moving! lol the music isn't the best in it tho,1394496000,,234,3.4339622641509435
3048856,4,B0010F8JFM,"I am one of those people who does not feel very comfortable dancing unless I am home alone or I have alcohol in me. This dance DVD helped me learn transitions to different dance steps, which I have already had a problem with.  The music is horrible but what counts is learning basic moves so you can feel confident dancing out on the town or just having fun at home.",1392940800,2,366,4.228571428571429
3048857,2,B0010F8JFM,Don't waste your time on this. You're better off watching actually music videos on tv or youtube. Gave it an extra star for effort.,1391990400,,131,4.5
3048858,4,B0010F8JFM,"I really like this video and I keep coming back to it because the moves are pretty simple. There aren't long, drawn out routines to learn and I think it's kind of funny that this is titled as being moves 'for the club' when it's in the club that some people like to show off their practiced routines. Some of these moves take up a bit of room and if you were really trying to do this on a crowded dance floor you might elbow someone in the eye but it's really easy to tone it down a bit and just give it a nice, gentle flow. I think the moves in the video need to be a little exaggerated to really show how it's done so it's easier to pick up on. Something like 'the dip' early  on is something my poor thighs probably can't handle for long but without going as low, it's a nice swervy move and I think that's a lot of what the video focuses on, just getting your hips moving. So many people told me that before, just move your hips but without any direction I still felt lost and awkward and this video really gave me the confidence to just get out there and start shaking it. I didn't find much fault with the way the video was done or the instructions but you'll probably have to rewind a few times (as i did) to really nail some of the moves during the instructional part.

Fun bonus... you get taught how to twerk in this video. This dvd was made a little bit before that term came into the mainstream but when you get to the moves booty bounce and booty pop well... You'll see.",1391212800,,1483,4.075342465753424
3048859,5,B0010F8JFM,"Being 52 years old, my ""Sexy Moves"" aren't happening in a ""CLUB,"" they're happening in my living room, but it is FUN! FUN! FUN!  Granted, I absolutely lived to dance in my younger years (Disco, anyone!), so the moves are familiar to me, but even if you are not someone who dances, or had danced in a ""past life"" like me, you will absolutely love this DVD!!!
The instructions are clear, and you get into the dance moves immediately, which is unlike some other instructional DVD's on dance that I have tried. In other words, you won't loose interest or get frustrated waiting for an instructor to stop yacking and get to it!  With this DVD, you get right into the moves, which makes it, well, FUN!
Note also, that you are shown the moves from not just the front but the back as well, so that you can mirror them exactly.
But, don't be fooled by how fun this video is - these moves kick your butt!!!  And that's when all geared up in your workout clothes - but these women are performing these moves in their club clothes - the clothes you see them in on the package!  Amazing! That is how incredibly aerobically fit these woman are - pulling off these muscle-burning moves in stillettos!!!
If you used to dance and want to get back into it, this DVD is for you!
If you currently dance and want to bring your skills to the next level and amp up your aerobic abilities, this DVD is for you!
If you don't dance, but have always wanted to learn, this DVD is for you!
In short, this DVD is for YOU!!!",1391212800,4,1493,4.283687943262412
3048860,4,B0010F8JFM,"At first the slower pace was a little frustrating, but as I got to the harder moves I was really happy about it.
When I came to the 'workout' part I was already warmed up from doing the whole video and it kicked my butt!!

15 minutes never felt so long, I worked up a pretty good sweat and I didn't think I would...very pleased.

I'll be doing this again and again until I can get some of the harder moves down.",1391212800,,411,4.0
3048861,1,B0010F8JFM,"This is pretty awful - not what I expected, almost laughable except now I am stuck with this lameness.  Ugh.",1388707200,,108,4.4
3048862,3,B0010F8JFM,"This would've been a really good dvd if it weren't for the videography.  This is the first dance instructional video I've seen where much of the video doesn't even show the women's legs!  There are too many zoom shots of the girls' butts and upper half.  If you don't catch on to dance moves quickly it's especially annoying.  ""Too often The instructor goes- Ready?  Let's do it full out, now. 5-6-7-8 and..."" and they start the move, but you can't see their legs until they've already done a few steps of it.  There are times when I have no idea what leg the girls are about to start their move in because the camera person is too busy showing us a girl's butt during the move.  For one example- The sit and Roll move- when they turn their backs to show you how the move looks from behind they actually start on the opposite leg than they used when they showed you the front side... But you don't realize this until after they've already started doing the move because you don't get to see their leg position!  All I could think of trying to follow this dvd is that the camera person was using this job to zoom in on parts HE wanted to see and forgot this was supposed to be a dance instruction video.

If you pick up moves quickly the 1/4 of the time they spend not showing you the full body of the move probably won't bother you so much, but for someone like me it's a real pain.  I feel I often have to rewind the move back to a shot where they're actually showing the legs and whole body doing the move so that I can practice it.",1386374400,27,1534,4.187074829931973
3048863,5,B0010F8JFM,"Fun for a lark, never thought I'd work out in sandals but it's actually not bad.  The dance moves are especially good for toning thighs and your core.  I'm way too old to be using the moves at a club but it's fun for an alternate workout.",1384387200,2,238,4.042553191489362

3048867,2,B0010F8JFM,"The lack of stars has nothing to do with the seller (arrived on time and in great condition)...having said that, this dvd sucks! You don't really learn any ""moves""  and the same song is on loop through the whole video. Very annoying! They teach you the same move in a few different ways. It all seems like a warm up and when you're ready to dance, it's over! WTH?!?! Not worth the money. I read the (bad) reviews and I thought I'd try it anyway and form my own opinion...should have listened to them. DON'T DO IT!!!",1370131200,5,515,4.309278350515464
3048868,3,B0010F8JFM,"The lead instructor of this DVD is very clear, concise and helpful. I love the way they slow down the moves before taking them up to full speed. A little bit too boring to do all at once but fun if you break it up into the different segments (i.e. hips, booty moves, arms, etc). One of the backup dancers is awful and really distracting but in general this is a solid choice if you're looking for sexy, practical moves that you can ACTUALLY use at a club, not just in a dance studio. You'll feel sexier after doing it! Might want to add your own music, do it with friends, and then it could be a regular party. It's a decent workout too.",1367193600,,637,4.145161290322581
3048869,5,B0010F8JFM,"Nicole Guidetti, Dana DePalo, and Erynn Turkovich are real professional and highly experienced dancers.

If you are looking for some really extra hot, sexy moves you have come to the right place.

You will learn flirty moves such as whipping your hair with a smile; attention grabbing moves such as the elbow pop, sit n' roll and cross-step; sensual moves such as bending over , arching your back, placing your hands on your hips, showing your curves, making your hands roll down your body ,sticking your butt out and shacking your booty.

These moves really work !!!

Trust me  I'm a guy and you heard it from a guy.

Nicole is a really great teacher. She does an exceptionally brilliant job of making the DVD really fun and very practical.

The dancers really look great and sexy, especially Dana. If you wear something similar to what she is wearing and combine it with Nicole's moves, I promise you, your guy won't stop blushing.  For those wanting the attention guys won't stop drooling and thinking about you.

Just a quick note for the ladies, stay safe, look after yourselves, attract a really great guy, don't get involved with the wrong guys and keep away from the bad guys. When you start getting the attention, you may start getting it from both the good guys and bad ones, you will need to enforce boundaries as to the type of guy you don't want to get involved with.

The music has a great vibe and goes with the moves.

You can use the moves while dancing alone or with a partner. You can use them in a club or party setting. There are no complicated routines and no memorization.  Each of the moves can be done on their own or in any order.

You can use the moves while practicing to dance alone in your room to get some inspiration !!!

You can also use the transitions in your gym workouts and dance studio lessons,  to get a really good workout and have some fun at the same time.

I want to really encourage you to Get  Girls Night out as well.

There is a Free Fat Burning DVD inside worth $19.00 in value.

You can buy the both for just $39.97 on their website and get the total package. This price is at the time of writing this review.

Guys you can buy this for that really special someone, your sister , your cousin or a friend who is really into dance. They `ll love it. There might be a couple of unisex dance  moves that might be adaptable for guys if you add some swagger such as the elbow pop. As a guy you can use this for your own personal knowledge and be able to point the ladies in the right direction if you know anyone who might need this DVD.

Moves include:
Rock step
Heal Groove (Bend your knees, twist your heels, swing your hips from side, play with your hands and flirt)
Cross step (Combination: Cross your foot over your other leg, step to the right and the left, swing your hips, let your hands go, feel the groove, shimmy your shoulders)
Sit n' Roll (Use your hips to sit, stick your butt out, roll your chest and create a really sensual vibe)
Whack step
Grinding moves (Circular grind, grinding from the back, grinding down to the floor)
Side grind / Ticking
Hip Walk
The Dip
Head roll (Circular grind and whip your hair)
Shimmy (Shimmy your shoulders to the beats)
Booty hit (Flirty party move. Half circle with the butt, popping your hip, throw your arms up, play with  your hair)
Booty bounce (Sexy booty shaking, gets lots of attention)
Booty pop
Elbow pop
Sexy body roll

This DVD set is shear genius, nothing short of a master piece, the first of its kind and one of the few that specifically address the topic of nightclub and party dancing.

You can learn a whole lot more from the DVD set alone than from conventional dance lessons that don't show you how to really get down, plus you can save yourself money.",1361577600,,3766,4.39193083573487

3048874,5,B0010F8JFM,"These girls break down all the moves slowly, then show you how to do them at full speed. I enjoy their explanations and it's cool to see each of the 3 girls do their own version of each move, so you start to see how each person has their own flavor.

If you have no dance experience and 2 left feet like me when I started, you probably won't be able to master all the moves in one watch-through. There's a lot of easy  moves but some of the really cool looking ones took me a couple tries to really get the steps down. I highly recommend going through the dvd several times and remember not to be too hard on yourself. Luckily no one's watching while you learn!

Each time I watched the instructional dvd, I got better at each move. By the time I got through everything the 5th or 6th time, I'd finally mastered them all.

Now I include the cardio/fat-burning routine (which features all the moves you've learned) as part of my workout rotation. This really gets all the moves deep in your muscle memory, so they effortlessly come out on the dance floor.

One of the things I liked about these moves is they work well for almost any song or tempo, and the girls show you transitions to seamlessly connect any move with another so you look like you've got a routine without having to memorize anything.

Before I got this dvd, all I would do at the club was a lame sway and maybe a side to side step. Now, I feel confident on the dance floor, I have way more fun,  and sometimes even get compliments.

The same company offers another dvd with the same girls and the exact same teaching format called ""Girls Night Out"" which has a whole different set of dance moves you can learn. Both dvds are great, and if you love dancing, I definitely recommend getting the other one after you've mastered this set.",1355961600,,1801,4.3234421364985165

They break down the moves so easily and the choreography is pretty universal-- it goes to pretty much ANY song. I recently had a ladies night with some girlfriends (non-dancers) and they loved it too. They picked the moves up easily. This is great for beginning through advanced skills. I just ordered the other dvds in the series and chose to rush my shipping. I can't get enough. This is so fun, inspiring, and... bonus: you get a GREAT WORK OUT -- lots of isometric movement and if you do the whole thing from start to finish it hits all the major opposing muscle groups.

Things I liked:

I like that there are women teaching it so I felt immediately comfortable with the instructors, and the fact that they danced on tour with celebs was an added bonus.

It's not too hard: Even if you're a klutz like me, the moves are easy to master after just one viewing. I hate when DVD's show you moves that you have to be a dancer to figure out, this is more simple and makes sense.

BUY IT if you want to get over your fear of dancing!!!",1317686400,12,630,4.048387096774194
3048884,4,B0010F8JFM,This is a fun video to watch and dance to. Moves are pretty good and music is decent. The tall brunette is funny to watch too. She can't dance and has the funniest expressions. Overall recommend for a workout or for some unique moves.,1317513600,,234,4.340909090909091
3048885,5,B0010F8JFM,"I love this dvd, the moves are so simple to learn, yet look really good on the dance floor. I never normally have many moves or any confidence, but after learning the moves on this dvd, and the 2nd dvd 'Girls Night Out', I have leanred so much and cannot wait to get on the dance floor and bust some moves!

On both dvds the instructers are brilliant, and they break each move down really clearly and slowly so you can practise and pick it up. Also, each dvd ends with putting some of the moves together, to show you how you would actually use these on the dance floor in a club. I have leanred some of these sequences and have used them on nights out. The dvds are brilliant!",1315958400,5,676,4.1603053435114505

3048891,5,B0010F8JFM,"Great DVD! I love to dance but was always pretty pathetic and awkward at it, although I'm in pretty good shape. So I decided I needed something to teach me how to dance properly as well as sexy. I saw somewhere that the instructor in this dvd has actually been a choreographer for beyonce and some other pretty famous people so felt like a good buy. This DVD is perfect! The instructor has an example of each move and breaks each move down so you know exactly how your body is supposed to move. It involves about 20 or so moves, not all of them suitable for clubbing but great to know how to do if you ever want to use them. The only bad things about it is that the mic gets muffled a little at times and the chick on the right kinda sucks. Also the music could be changed up a bit. The moves are sexy and not slutty. Also a pretty good workout! Now I'm way more confident dancing! Fabulous buy :)",1282176000,5,897,4.1022727272727275

Its not some wacky fitness video - its a total for real dance instruction video.  Sexy dance video I should say.  I loved it.  I don't go to clubs much anymore but now I'm looking for excuses to show off some of these moves.
If you like to dance - get this.  Why not perfect a few moves or learn some.  Its fun.  But again -  Its a dance video not a weight loss/fitness one.",1280361600,4,632,3.859375

3048904,5,B0010F8JFM,"I mostly bought this product to see how much of a workout it'd be. I love dancing, but I love it more when it gets me sweating. Here are the pros and cons, in my opinion:

Pros:
-Most moves are easy and fun
-Definitely gives you a great workout!
-Works well with all sorts of club music
-The moves are great for in the club
-Although repetitive, the music is good for the moves
-Each move is broken down step-by-step and shown from various angles. Tips are also given for some of the harder moves.
-It starts out slow with helpful basics that make later moves easier.

Cons:
-Some moves are really hard, especially if you're on carpeting at home
-If you don't like repetitive music, it'll get annoying.

Overall, I really liked this DVD. It's a great workout and, if you get tired, it's easy to stop and go back later, as each move is broken into scenes in a moves menu (like a scenes menu). I'll definitely be practicing these moves whenever I can!",1247529600,7,949,4.380681818181818

Again.. Great instructer.. She's got a way of making you feel really comfortable and that you can make these moves your own and not make a fool of yourself..
but again.. same problem I had with the other DVD
the dancer to the instructor's left (my right) she was too distracting because she moved like she didn't know what she was doing.. If she wasn't on the DVD.. it would be a great but..
I wish they would have switched up the music.. Having it be the same throughout was a bit boring..

I especially loved the 15 minute workout program; it's perfect for both practice and exercise. I have a lot more confidence now, and my legs have toned up. Haha but what's up with the girl on the right? She's a hoot to watch. She can't keep up with the other two girls.",1221264000,4,543,4.230769230769231

There are a few distracting things on the DVD (like one of the dancer's bangles making sounds and the mic being brushed against a few times).

So I decided to buy this and the accompanying dvd..... I love it. Not only can I use these moves at the club, but it's a really great workout (My legs were sore the next day after trying one move, although I was repeating the move all day long trying to get it down  :P) I like the music (it is repetitive but I liked it.) and the way the host breaks down the moves helps you out so much. And it's really great that they do these moves in heels. (the other DVD they wear sneakers, but I still love the moves). If you want to learn some easy moves that will give you the basics for the club, I def recommend this dvd. This gives you a nice base to start on.",1203206400,33,861,3.976878612716763
3048914,3,B0010F8JFM,"From the reviews I thought this was going to be wonderful!

and maybe it is because I am not American? But I did NOT find the moves sexy.

things I liked: it was definitely aimed at night club dancers, the girls were in heels, and the moves were on the spot, simple walking, stuff that you CAN do when you are out dancing

- I liked some of the arm stuff, as it can be hard to know what to do with  your arms

Things I didn't like
- the moves didn't seem sexy to me!
- the music I did not like (it was very repetitive)

So on the whole I wasn't that impressed.

BUT if you go out and don't know what to do, this could be a good starting point. Or even just something to give you ideas for what you could try next.",1203120000,15,713,3.8095238095238093
3283337,5,B0010F8JFM,"lovedddddddd it! It was an incredibly well done video and the most important thing, the instruction, was also the best thing about it. The video is set up like this: there are about 25 moves in total, including transition moves. Each move starts out with the dancers demonstrating the move first, lasting about thirty seconds or so. Then the lead begins with a very detailed explanation where she breaks everything down, body part by body part. Her pointers were extremely effective and she's great at anticipating what you would be struggling with. Each move is about 5 minutes long and Nicole shows you the move from the front as well as the back. The camera angles were very professional and the close-ups were definitely useful. Oh did I mention they were wearing heels? Yes, these hot dance moves are possible in four inch heels! Finally, each section is wrapped up by the girls showing you the move full speed one last time and giving you last minute pointers. You may have to rewind some of the more difficult moves several times, but it's almost scary to see yourself improve. I started seeing changes almost immediately after I bought the video and my moves became smoother in no time.",1198800000,75,1194,4.7451923076923075

So for a Christmas gift I decided I'd buy her an instructional dance video.  I decided to get a copy for myself as well.  These girls really know how to move and the lead instructor is a very good teacher.  I bought a dance workout video in the past, and while the fitness element was good, the moves were really cheesy and I would never in a thousand years use them in a nightclub.  This DVD, however, is a complete 180 degrees.  It teaches sexy dance moves that I can totally see myself using.  The moves are sexy and flirty, sometimes overstepping just the right amount into ""edgy"", without ever making you wonder what another girl would think of your dancing.  Now that's not an easy feat.",1197244800,17,836,4.280254777070064
3283340,5,B0010F8JFM,"The product description is actually amazingly close to the real thing! You almost never see that these days.  Sexy Moves For The Club is a two disc set.  The first DVD is about 100 minutes long and only has the instruction.  The instruction is definitely really good.  All three ladies on the cover are instructors in the video although only one of them does most of the talking, the one in the center.  They all really know what they're doing though and they all differ a bit in their styles - which is good since you get to pick the one you want to copy.  Each lesson is about 5 minutes long and is incredibly detailed.  The section on transitions is very useful as well.  By transitions, they mean a short spin or dance move that you can do in between the other dance moves to switch between them.  They actually show you four different transitions and they're all pretty good.

The second DVD has the Bonus Workout as well as some other special features.  The Bonus Workout is 15 minutes long and is actually pretty good.  They don't say anything while they lead the workout and let the music do the talking - which is actually great because I hate it when fitness instructors have too much motivational talk.  Pop-ups throughout the workout give you different tips and announce how much time you have left.  The other special features are a Bio page (these girls have danced with some seriously famous people), and something called Instructors In The Club which shows how each of the instructors would dance in a club using the moves from the video.

Overall, what an exceptional product!  One of the best instructional videos I've seen for sure.",1196812800,61,1651,4.583617747440273

3283351,4,B0010F8JFM,"I would have given this 5 stars except for the music, which is a few very boring, repetitive songs on loops the entire time. Maybe they chose that so the viewer wouldn't be distracted and could instead focus just on the dance moves, I don't know.

Anyway, the lead instructor is adorable, and gives very good cues. She breaks every move down first by going slowly and explaining it, then breaks it apart even more by focusing on the various body parts involved. Then, they quicken the pace and show it at regular speed. I think they spend just enough time on each move. Some reviewers have complained that they don't break it down enough, or that you need prior experience to learn moves. I disagree. If they spent more time with each move, the video would be way too long! That's the whole point of a video...you can watch it over and over and practice on your own and then watch their explanations again. Don't expect yourself to be perfect at it on the first viewing. Take your time, have fun.

The moves are indeed very sexy. Some, I've seen friends do over the years (like the body roll), and always wondered...how do they DO that!? I thought they were just magically born with the ability. :-) Others, are more on the trampy side, like exotic dancing. I personally may not do them, but still like to know them, as even just incorporating a few seconds of a really sexy move can spice up your night. :-)

This video requires so much lower body strength that even if you're just going through the video slowly, stopping and rewinding to get the moves down, you WILL USE and strengthen your legs. Lots of bending knees squating while rolling and swinging the hips type of stuff. Great core and leg workout, and I thought my legs were already pretty strong.

One other complaint...one of the backup dancers is HORRIBLE. It's distracting. She's not tight with her movements and just overall looks sloppy and trampy. It's one thing to look cute and sexy, it's another to look tacky, cheap, and easy. And I am no prude. But I just try to not focus on her too much and stay focused on the lead girl, who somehow manages to teach sexy dance moves and remain approachable and classy. :-) I feel bad saying that, but honestly, it's so bad that if they make more of these videos, they should remove her. Or somehow get her to tighten up her moves. Maybe they have her there to show all levels, and make the rest of us not feel bad if we look awful at first too? :-/

Overall, definitely recommend, I'm really enjoying this video!",1394668800,2,2523,4.464208242950108

3283355,4,B0010F8JFM,"I really like this video and I keep coming back to it because the moves are pretty simple. There aren't long, drawn out routines to learn and I think it's kind of funny that this is titled as being moves 'for the club' when it's in the club that some people like to show off their practiced routines. Some of these moves take up a bit of room and if you were really trying to do this on a crowded dance floor you might elbow someone in the eye but it's really easy to tone it down a bit and just give it a nice, gentle flow. I think the moves in the video need to be a little exaggerated to really show how it's done so it's easier to pick up on. Something like 'the dip' early  on is something my poor thighs probably can't handle for long but without going as low, it's a nice swervy move and I think that's a lot of what the video focuses on, just getting your hips moving. So many people told me that before, just move your hips but without any direction I still felt lost and awkward and this video really gave me the confidence to just get out there and start shaking it. I didn't find much fault with the way the video was done or the instructions but you'll probably have to rewind a few times (as i did) to really nail some of the moves during the instructional part.

Fun bonus... you get taught how to twerk in this video. This dvd was made a little bit before that term came into the mainstream but when you get to the moves booty bounce and booty pop well... You'll see.",1391212800,,1483,4.075342465753424
3283356,5,B0010F8JFM,"Being 52 years old, my ""Sexy Moves"" aren't happening in a ""CLUB,"" they're happening in my living room, but it is FUN! FUN! FUN!  Granted, I absolutely lived to dance in my younger years (Disco, anyone!), so the moves are familiar to me, but even if you are not someone who dances, or had danced in a ""past life"" like me, you will absolutely love this DVD!!!
The instructions are clear, and you get into the dance moves immediately, which is unlike some other instructional DVD's on dance that I have tried. In other words, you won't loose interest or get frustrated waiting for an instructor to stop yacking and get to it!  With this DVD, you get right into the moves, which makes it, well, FUN!
Note also, that you are shown the moves from not just the front but the back as well, so that you can mirror them exactly.
But, don't be fooled by how fun this video is - these moves kick your butt!!!  And that's when all geared up in your workout clothes - but these women are performing these moves in their club clothes - the clothes you see them in on the package!  Amazing! That is how incredibly aerobically fit these woman are - pulling off these muscle-burning moves in stillettos!!!
If you used to dance and want to get back into it, this DVD is for you!
If you currently dance and want to bring your skills to the next level and amp up your aerobic abilities, this DVD is for you!
If you don't dance, but have always wanted to learn, this DVD is for you!
In short, this DVD is for YOU!!!",1391212800,4,1493,4.283687943262412

When I came to the 'workout' part I was already warmed up from doing the whole video and it kicked my butt!!

15 minutes never felt so long, I worked up a pretty good sweat and I didn't think I would...very pleased.

I'll be doing this again and again until I can get some of the harder moves down.",1391212800,,411,4.0

3283359,3,B0010F8JFM,"This would've been a really good dvd if it weren't for the videography.  This is the first dance instructional video I've seen where much of the video doesn't even show the women's legs!  There are too many zoom shots of the girls' butts and upper half.  If you don't catch on to dance moves quickly it's especially annoying.  ""Too often The instructor goes- Ready?  Let's do it full out, now. 5-6-7-8 and..."" and they start the move, but you can't see their legs until they've already done a few steps of it.  There are times when I have no idea what leg the girls are about to start their move in because the camera person is too busy showing us a girl's butt during the move.  For one example- The sit and Roll move- when they turn their backs to show you how the move looks from behind they actually start on the opposite leg than they used when they showed you the front side... But you don't realize this until after they've already started doing the move because you don't get to see their leg position!  All I could think of trying to follow this dvd is that the camera person was using this job to zoom in on parts HE wanted to see and forgot this was supposed to be a dance instruction video.

If you pick up moves quickly the 1/4 of the time they spend not showing you the full body of the move probably won't bother you so much, but for someone like me it's a real pain.  I feel I often have to rewind the move back to a shot where they're actually showing the legs and whole body doing the move so that I can practice it.",1386374400,27,1534,4.187074829931973

You don't really learn any ""moves""  and the same song is on loop through the whole video. Very annoying! They teach you the same move in a few different ways. It all seems like a warm up and when you're ready to dance, it's over! WTH?!?! Not worth the money. I read the (bad) reviews and I thought I'd try it anyway and form my own opinion...should have listened to them. DON'T DO IT!!!",1370131200,5,515,4.309278350515464

A little bit too boring to do all at once but fun if you break it up into the different segments (i.e. hips, booty moves, arms, etc). One of the backup dancers is awful and really distracting but in general this is a solid choice if you're looking for sexy, practical moves that you can ACTUALLY use at a club, not just in a dance studio. You'll feel sexier after doing it! Might want to add your own music, do it with friends, and then it could be a regular party. It's a decent workout too.",1367193600,,637,4.145161290322581
3283366,5,B0010F8JFM,"Nicole Guidetti, Dana DePalo, and Erynn Turkovich are real professional and highly experienced dancers.

If you are looking for some really extra hot, sexy moves you have come to the right place.

You will learn flirty moves such as whipping your hair with a smile; attention grabbing moves such as the elbow pop, sit n' roll and cross-step; sensual moves such as bending over , arching your back, placing your hands on your hips, showing your curves, making your hands roll down your body ,sticking your butt out and shacking your booty.

These moves really work !!!

Trust me  I'm a guy and you heard it from a guy.

Nicole is a really great teacher. She does an exceptionally brilliant job of making the DVD really fun and very practical.

The dancers really look great and sexy, especially Dana. If you wear something similar to what she is wearing and combine it with Nicole's moves, I promise you, your guy won't stop blushing.  For those wanting the attention guys won't stop drooling and thinking about you.

Just a quick note for the ladies, stay safe, look after yourselves, attract a really great guy, don't get involved with the wrong guys and keep away from the bad guys. When you start getting the attention, you may start getting it from both the good guys and bad ones, you will need to enforce boundaries as to the type of guy you don't want to get involved with.

The music has a great vibe and goes with the moves.

You can use the moves while dancing alone or with a partner. You can use them in a club or party setting. There are no complicated routines and no memorization.  Each of the moves can be done on their own or in any order.

You can use the moves while practicing to dance alone in your room to get some inspiration !!!

You can also use the transitions in your gym workouts and dance studio lessons,  to get a really good workout and have some fun at the same time.

I want to really encourage you to Get  Girls Night out as well.

There is a Free Fat Burning DVD inside worth $19.00 in value.

You can buy the both for just $39.97 on their website and get the total package. This price is at the time of writing this review.

Guys you can buy this for that really special someone, your sister , your cousin or a friend who is really into dance. They `ll love it. There might be a couple of unisex dance  moves that might be adaptable for guys if you add some swagger such as the elbow pop. As a guy you can use this for your own personal knowledge and be able to point the ladies in the right direction if you know anyone who might need this DVD.

Moves include:
Rock step
Heal Groove (Bend your knees, twist your heels, swing your hips from side, play with your hands and flirt)
Cross step (Combination: Cross your foot over your other leg, step to the right and the left, swing your hips, let your hands go, feel the groove, shimmy your shoulders)
Sit n' Roll (Use your hips to sit, stick your butt out, roll your chest and create a really sensual vibe)
Whack step
Grinding moves (Circular grind, grinding from the back, grinding down to the floor)
Side grind / Ticking
Hip Walk
The Dip
Head roll (Circular grind and whip your hair)
Shimmy (Shimmy your shoulders to the beats)
Booty hit (Flirty party move. Half circle with the butt, popping your hip, throw your arms up, play with  your hair)
Booty bounce (Sexy booty shaking, gets lots of attention)
Booty pop
Elbow pop
Sexy body roll

This DVD set is shear genius, nothing short of a master piece, the first of its kind and one of the few that specifically address the topic of nightclub and party dancing.

You can learn a whole lot more from the DVD set alone than from conventional dance lessons that don't show you how to really get down, plus you can save yourself money.",1361577600,,3766,4.39193083573487

After just a couple of days watching and practicing I felt ready to take to the test and found it a lot of fun to use what I had learned.  This is a great addition to the first video and even if you don't go out to clubs to use the moves, you can use it at home for a fun cardio workout and choreograph your own dance from the moves they teach you.  This would make a great gift.",1356825600,,463,3.8526315789473684

3283371,5,B0010F8JFM,"These girls break down all the moves slowly, then show you how to do them at full speed. I enjoy their explanations and it's cool to see each of the 3 girls do their own version of each move, so you start to see how each person has their own flavor.

If you have no dance experience and 2 left feet like me when I started, you probably won't be able to master all the moves in one watch-through. There's a lot of easy  moves but some of the really cool looking ones took me a couple tries to really get the steps down. I highly recommend going through the dvd several times and remember not to be too hard on yourself. Luckily no one's watching while you learn!

Each time I watched the instructional dvd, I got better at each move. By the time I got through everything the 5th or 6th time, I'd finally mastered them all.

Now I include the cardio/fat-burning routine (which features all the moves you've learned) as part of my workout rotation. This really gets all the moves deep in your muscle memory, so they effortlessly come out on the dance floor.

One of the things I liked about these moves is they work well for almost any song or tempo, and the girls show you transitions to seamlessly connect any move with another so you look like you've got a routine without having to memorize anything.

Before I got this dvd, all I would do at the club was a lame sway and maybe a side to side step. Now, I feel confident on the dance floor, I have way more fun,  and sometimes even get compliments.

The same company offers another dvd with the same girls and the exact same teaching format called ""Girls Night Out"" which has a whole different set of dance moves you can learn. Both dvds are great, and if you love dancing, I definitely recommend getting the other one after you've mastered this set.",1355961600,,1801,4.3234421364985165

They break down the moves so easily and the choreography is pretty universal-- it goes to pretty much ANY song. I recently had a ladies night with some girlfriends (non-dancers) and they loved it too. They picked the moves up easily. This is great for beginning through advanced skills. I just ordered the other dvds in the series and chose to rush my shipping. I can't get enough. This is so fun, inspiring, and... bonus: you get a GREAT WORK OUT -- lots of isometric movement and if you do the whole thing from start to finish it hits all the major opposing muscle groups.

Things I liked:

I like that there are women teaching it so I felt immediately comfortable with the instructors, and the fact that they danced on tour with celebs was an added bonus.

It's not too hard: Even if you're a klutz like me, the moves are easy to master after just one viewing. I hate when DVD's show you moves that you have to be a dancer to figure out, this is more simple and makes sense.

On both dvds the instructers are brilliant, and they break each move down really clearly and slowly so you can practise and pick it up.

The instructor has an example of each move and breaks each move down so you know exactly how your body is supposed to move. It involves about 20 or so moves, not all of them suitable for clubbing but great to know how to do if you ever want to use them. The only bad things about it is that the mic gets muffled a little at times and the chick on the right kinda sucks. Also the music could be changed up a bit. The moves are sexy and not slutty.

Pros:
-Most moves are easy and fun
-Definitely gives you a great workout!
-Works well with all sorts of club music
-The moves are great for in the club
-Although repetitive, the music is good for the moves
-Each move is broken down step-by-step and shown from various angles. Tips are also given for some of the harder moves.
-It starts out slow with helpful basics that make later moves easier.

Cons:
-Some moves are really hard, especially if you're on carpeting at home
-If you don't like repetitive music, it'll get annoying.

Overall, I really liked this DVD. It's a great workout and, if you get tired, it's easy to stop and go back later, as each move is broken into scenes in a moves menu (like a scenes menu). I'll definitely be practicing these moves whenever I can!",1247529600,7,949,4.380681818181818
3283402,5,B0010F8JFM,"I loved it. You can use almost all the moves in the club. Well, actually all but I really haven't mastered some of them yet. lol They are not hard, it's just that I am not that good. I'll be looking forward to their another new video and buy again.",1241481600,,248,3.98
3283403,4,B0010F8JFM,"I also bought this DVD when I purchased Girls Night Out from their Nightclub Dance Series.
Again.. Great instructer.. She's got a way of making you feel really comfortable and that you can make these moves your own and not make a fool of yourself..
but again.. same problem I had with the other DVD
the dancer to the instructor's left (my right) she was too distracting because she moved like she didn't know what she was doing.. If she wasn't on the DVD.. it would be a great but..
I wish they would have switched up the music.. Having it be the same throughout was a bit boring..
Still great DVD and worth the money you'll spend on it..",1239494400,,638,4.325
3283404,4,B0010F8JFM,"I liked both of the Nightclub Dance Series dvds because they come with many different moves. There are simple to complex moves and they can also be used as a workout. The instructions are easy, and I recommend both dvds in the series.",1234224000,,234,4.465116279069767
3283405,5,B0010F8JFM,"She breaks down the moves really well, very easy to learn them. Finally I understand how to booty bounce! Some are a bit silly and I would never use at a club but the majority I will. There enough moves that I couldn't learn all of them in one session, so defiantly worth the buy.",1223424000,3,280,4.109090909090909
3283406,5,B0010F8JFM,"I absolutely loved this video! Some of the moves are a little intense, and I would never try outside my room. A few you would have to completely perfect or you would look pretty dumb at the club. However, most of the moves are completely sensible, and all of them are sexy. I especially loved the 15 minute workout program; it's perfect for both practice and exercise. I have a lot more confidence now, and my legs have toned up. Haha but what's up with the girl on the right? She's a hoot to watch. She can't keep up with the other two girls.",1221264000,4,543,4.230769230769231
3283407,4,B0010F8JFM,"I have really enjoyed learning with this DVD. I love dancing but don't have experience with this type of style. I have always wanted to dance like this, but didn't know how. Now I do!

There are a few distracting things on the DVD (like one of the dancer's bangles making sounds and the mic being brushed against a few times). But overall, I really loved this DVD and would recommend it. I won't be following these moves exactly, but I feel confident that I can use what I have learned and combine it with my own style.",1218067200,2,519,4.295918367346939
3283408,3,B0010F8JFM,"I orderded this dvd, and overall im satatisfied with it. Some of the dance moves were really cute and flirty, however most of these moves looked ridiculous,would not do in public or i either, already knew how to do.

the instructor really breaks down each step which is helpful, and you have the choice to choose which dancers' style you'd like to copy.

so if your looking for a dance dvd with some interesting moves, this is for you",1216425600,7,434,4.481012658227848
3283409,5,B0010F8JFM,"I loved this DVD. I basically have ""two left feet"" and I am terribly uncoordinated and NOT a dancer. I was surprised with not only how easy these moves are, but also how useful they are. I was so tired of avoiding dancing in clubs because I was soooo bad. This video has given me hope and I am learning the moves and using them and am no longer embarrassed about dancing.",1212278400,11,371,4.166666666666667
3283410,5,B0010F8JFM,"I saw their practice stuff and one of the moves from the dvd on youtube and I thought, what they hey, the music sounded pretty good and the dance move they showed seemed done in a professional enough way. So I decided to buy this and the accompanying dvd..... I love it. Not only can I use these moves at the club, but it's a really great workout (My legs were sore the next day after trying one move, although I was repeating the move all day long trying to get it down  :P) I like the music (it is repetitive but I liked it.) and the way the host breaks down the moves helps you out so much. And it's really great that they do these moves in heels. (the other DVD they wear sneakers, but I still love the moves). If you want to learn some easy moves that will give you the basics for the club, I def recommend this dvd. This gives you a nice base to start on.",1203206400,33,861,3.976878612716763
3283411,3,B0010F8JFM,"From the reviews I thought this was going to be wonderful!

and maybe it is because I am not American? But I did NOT find the moves sexy.

things I liked: it was definitely aimed at night club dancers, the girls were in heels, and the moves were on the spot, simple walking, stuff that you CAN do when you are out dancing

- I liked some of the arm stuff, as it can be hard to know what to do with  your arms

Things I didn't like
- the moves didn't seem sexy to me!
- the music I did not like (it was very repetitive)

So on the whole I wasn't that impressed.

BUT if you go out and don't know what to do, this could be a good starting point. Or even just something to give you ideas for what you could try next.",1203120000,15,713,3.8095238095238093
8237810,5,B0010F8JFM,"It's excellent if you want to learn to be the best dancer on the dance floor.  Couldn't be better, wish I got it when I was younger.  All of the moves look so unattainable, but then they show you how it's so easy.  Definitely would recommend!!!",1498608000,,244,4.260869565217392

8237812,5,B0010F8JFM,"I actually seem to misplace this DVD & can't find it, but back when I first ordered it, for a person who doesn't go to parties, clubs or doesn't dance this was a pretty good startup. I ended up doing activities that I actually enjoy rather than try to blend in into society like all the ""cool kids"", so this DVD was probably placed in unused box, but I remember when I ordered the movies were decent.",1490140800,,400,4.207792207792208

8237814,1,B0010F8JFM,Most of the moves taught aren't anything you would actually do at a club.  It didn't include a workout DVD as indicated in product review.  I think this video was made in early 2000's. Not good.,1479168000,,194,4.361111111111111
8237815,3,B0010F8JFM,"I have to thank some of the moves I have now to this DVD.  I really like the fact that it is fun, but still makes you sweat.  The breakdown of the moves are also very good and when you put it all together it is just so much fun and looks great! Granted this is not the type of exercise that you would do if you want intensity, but is a more fun light workout.",1450224000,,359,3.710526315789474
