7063033,2,B00UNONQSQ,"""Run All Night"" is many solid parts coming together as a mundane whole. Ed Harris is magnificent in his performance as Liam Neeson's brother and legendary crime boss, Chicago emcee Common is surprisingly good as the assassin sent in to do Harris's dirty work and great pains were taken to keep a viscerally gritty look that has proven timeless with many action films of the past. The problem lies in Liam Neeson, who does a fine enough job here, clinging to the same generic sub-plot of a man who is a failure as a father(something carelessly injected into the back story of nearly every genre entry he has been in so far) and find a chance through violence to redeem himself. Equally unimpressive is the fact that the action scenes(outside of one nail biting sequence set inside a burning apartment complex) are mostly un-engaging and routine. The groan worthy finale is equally rote and predictable and the characters really exist no more than to service the plot. What is also fatal is that it never really takes its time to build any real genuine suspense along the way or exhibits any characteristics that makes it stands out from similar films. The director has added many artistic touches which take you through the city from one character to the left that are more distracting than effective. If anything this poses the question: How many more times and how many more ways is Hollywood going to tell essentially the same tale of vengeance and sell it as excitement and entertainment?",1426809600,3,1491,4.782945736434108
7063034,3,B00UNONQSQ,"Surely by now you've heard the jokes that Run All Night just looks like another of his Taken movies. That kind of comment has been unavoidable since the trailers were designed to resemble another ""kill everybody and save the family"" flick. In fact, when the trailer for Run All Night played in front of the abysmal Taken 3, the people behind me swore it was for Taken 4 and they were not being facetious. But the truth is that Neeson, who by now has perfected the grizzled, vengeful crusader routine to a tee, tries to do something a little different when he works with Unknown and Non-Stop director, Jaume Collet-Serra.

Run All Night marks their third collaboration and it's a down 'n dirty, hardboiled actioner, completely workmanlike and predictable in execution. What sets it apart from Neeson's other flicks is the character he plays, that of drunken, deadbeat dad Jimmy Conlon. For once we see Neeson play a hardcore killer who is a complete screw-up in other aspects of his life. Jimmy spent his life as an infamous hitman known as ""the Gravedigger"", working for New York mob boss and longtime friend Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). When we first meet Jimmy he's a total loser begging Shawn's egotistical son Danny (Boyd Holbrook) for cash and being forced to dress as Santa Claus. It takes some getting used to Neeson as such a pitiful character, but of course we know it can't last long. Jimmy may have lost his way but his son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) walks the straight and narrow, working with troubled kids at a boxing gym and working hard to support his growing family. But it's not easy, and Jimmy resents the life his father leads.

Of course that murderous life is also what saves Mike when the chips are down. After witnessing Danny's murder of some foreign drug dealers, Mike is a target for execution himself, only to have daddy come to the rescue and kill Danny. On the list of ""best ways to ruin a friendship"", killing your best friend's son ranks somewhere near the top, and Shawn puts out a hit on Jimmy and his boy. Cue the dirty cops and henchmen who pursue Jimmy and Mike all across New York's mean streets, while an obsessed detective (Vincent D'Onofrio, hammy as ever) is always one step behind. It would be nice if movies like this would just leave the police out of the equation completely. What's their purpose? Here they get mowed down left and right, make ridiculous errors in judgement....they're like cinematic packing peanuts.

Some great moments are found every time Harris and Neeson share the screen, elevating what turns out to be a plodding screenplay by Brad Inglesby. He's the guy whose unimpressive screenplay ruined Out of the Furnace's all-star cast, and he's completely unable to make Run All Night stand out in any way, too. Far too often the film doesn't really go anywhere, and when it does the direction it goes is purely rote. Plus, it's hard to escape the feeling that the run time has been padded out by scenes that have nothing to do with anything. It's like Non-Stop all over again. Nick Nolte has a cup of coffee late in the film as a random uncle, but his presence is unnecessary and leads to another scene that simply wastes time. Aren't these guys being chased by vicious killers? Where's the urgency? That time would have been better spent with more action because there isn't nearly enough. What we get is actually pretty good, including one terrific car chase and a tense escape from an apartment building. Collet-Serra isn't a director anybody would label as particularly creative, but there's a certain film noir sturdiness to the world he's able to build. However he does make a couple of odd choices, including the use of a zooming flyover screen to transition between scenes. It's like somebody turned replaced Run All Night with footage from their GPS.

Inglesby is rescued a little by Neeson, who for once plays a character that isn't invincible. Sure, he flips into ""Neeson Tough Guy Mode"" pretty quick but in-between Jimmy kicking ass he's a father trying to atone. Kinnaman comes off as a little whiny as his son, but he's better served than other wasted talents like Nolte, Genesis Rodriguez, and Common. Poor Common. The recent Oscar-winner plays Price, a particularly skillful assassin defined by his use of infrared gadgets. In a film full of hard-boiled, grounded characters Price comes off like a cartoon.

Run All Night isn't just another Taken movie, but Neeson's fans will see enough similarity to enjoy it, while those who wish he'd do something different may want to look elsewhere.",1426809600,,4559,4.765822784810126
7063035,5,B00UNONQSQ,"RUN ALL NIGHT has many twits and turns and is a real hard edged film. The story is very good, basic yet with substance. I love the mood and feel of this film. The performance move and advance the drama. There are several plot lines running amok, but by the film's conclusion it all comes together and you won't be disappointed. I love the old school approach that was similar to JACK REACHER, directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Director Jaume Collet-Serra definitely has his own style based on straightforward filmmaking and it works very effectively. There is intellect at work here combined with style and a sense of good storytelling.",1426723200,27,637,4.853211009174312
7063036,3,B00UNONQSQ,"Whats it about?

A former mob hitman gets caught in a web of conflicting loyalties and goes on the run trying to protect his estranged son from his good friend and boss.

What did I think?

Run All Night is edgy, gritty, character driven and fun  everything you want in an action thriller. But despite a solid Liam Neeson performance hes actually the biggest problem with it. His very presence robs the film of any unpredictability turning it into a by-the-numbers Neeson film (albeit an interesting one). The exploration of loyalty and the complexity of friendship and family is probably worth the price of admission but with someone else in Neesons role youd truly be on the edge of your seat. Great performances and intriguing plot are let down by an eventual lack of tension.",1426636800,,779,4.7481481481481485
7063037,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Run All Night
 Liam Neeson has been making a string of action films in the last few years, beginning with Taken in 2008.  These include three Taken films, Non Stop and A Walk Among the Tombstones besides Run All Night.  All of them work quite well as action shoot'um ups with some better than others.  Run All Night ranks right up there with the first Taken, taking a place superior to the other four.
 In Run All Night Neeson plays a washed up hit man, consumed by the guilt of his many dirty deeds and living in a bottle to mask the pain.  A series of violent events put him between his grown son (sparsely played by Joel Kinnaman in a powerful performance) and his lifelong friend, mentor and boss played by Ed Harris, one of our favorite actors.  The complex relationships make the movie interesting in a way that most action films are not.  Yes, we do have a lot of shooting, fighting and general mayhem but the background makes us care about who wins.  Sometimes action films are a simple exercise in watching interesting and innovative ways to kill bad guys.
 Directed at a feverish pace by Jaume Collet-Serrra (Non-Stop) from a script laced with wisdom and suffering by Brad Ingelsby.
 All of Neeson's action films are worth watching on that basis, but this one works as a character study because of the strong writing, well controlled direction and powerful acting, especially by Ed Harris.  The four saw blade actioner has an R rating for lots of hard violence, lots of bad words and open drug use.  It managed a $17 million take against the title wave of Cinderella for the opening weekend.",1426636800,,1601,4.575438596491228
7063038,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.  While aging movie stars making action movies is nothing new, perhaps no one has been more visible than 62 year old Liam Neeson (""Taken"" trilogy, ""A Walk Among the Tombstones,"" ""Non-Stop,""  ""Unknown"" and others).  Here Neeson reunites with director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Non-Stop"" and ""Unknown) in what may be his best yet.

Neeson plays Jimmy Conlon, a broken-down, drunken hit man for Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) the head of a NYC mob faction.  Maguire, while still shady, is trying to go a bit legit.  Jimmy isn't getting anything to do, but his old buddy Shawn feels sorry for him so throws him a bone now and then.  Shawn's son Danny (Boyd Holbrook, who also worked with Neeson in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones""), is still wanting to do some serious crime and invites some Albanian heroin traffickers to meet with dear old dad in order to pave the way for the drugs being introduced to the city pipeline.  But Shawn wants no part of the drug game, having had bad experiences years earlier (too much sampling by the employees).  This upsets the Albanians and Danny.  Of course the Albanians want the advance back they had given Danny, advising that they would stop by his house later to collect.

In a parallel story-line, Jimmy's estranged son Michael (Joel Kinnaman, ""Robocop""), has always been on the straight and narrow and has refused to see his dad for over 5 years.  Michael is married (Genesis Rodriguez, ""The Last Stand"") and has 2 young girls with another on the way.  He makes ends meet by driving a limo.  He's also a mentor to a young, fatherless boy who is believed to have a promising boxing career.  As luck would have it, Michael is dispatched to ferry the Albanians to Danny's apartment.  He waits outside in the car, while a confrontation inside the apartment results in bloodshed.  Michael becomes a witness and therefore a target for Danny.  Jimmy and Shawn become aware of the situation but before a solution can be arrived at, Danny takes it upon himself to go after Michael.  Jimmy, sensing this would happen, arrives just in time.

The remainder of the film deals with the chase by Shawn and his goon squad, plus a few crooked cops, going after the Conlons.  Neeson's character isn't the same guy we've seen so many times before.  Yes, he has ""a certain set of skills"" but they are unpolished and haven't been used in years.  Still with his son's life at stake, he manages to quickly restore them.  The car chase (of course), shows that Jimmy has some skills in this area too, but the director focus too much on shifting the old Camaro's slush box and stomping on the gas pedal.  The best thing about the movie and frankly, what sets it apart, are the great scenes between Shawn and Jimmy.  The two veteran actors are very convincing as the once best friends who have devolved into a life and death confrontation.  And they know it.  Their scenes remind me of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in 1995's ""Heat.""  Vincent D'Onofrio gives a nice performance as one of the only cops Jimmy trusts.

There is a nice fluidity about the film and some brilliantly staged camera tricks which provide a unique aerial view of the city.  ""Run All Night"" is an effective, old-school action flick imbued with more than a modicum of intelligence.",1426464000,39,3294,4.6747826086956525
7063039,3,B00UNONQSQ,"Our favorite action hero (of a certain age...) is back again. And his favorite director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Non-Stop"" and ""Unknown""), working from a script by Brad Ingelsby, doesn't leave us much time to breathe.

I can't think of one clich that was left unexploited, but remember, I have always said clichs become clichs because they work, as a result, after formulaic (and endless) fisticuffs, gun-play and vehicular mayhem, the last 10 minutes of this movie had me holding my breath.

Here we have an ageing hitman taking on his former boss (and childhood friend) in order to protect his own son from the former boss's wacko son. The dialogue that explains all of this is overwrought and tedious. Both Harris and Neeson are highly capable actors, so I blame the script.

We see:
  * Liam Neeson (""Taken 3"") Jimmy Conlon is the hitman in question. This movie starts with him dying and voicing his regrets for the way he has lived his life. Then we go back 12 hours to see how this came about.
  * Joel Kinnaman (""RoboCop"") is his decent, law-abiding (and alienated) son Mike. Mike has a job and a family, plus a deep, abiding dislike for his murderous father.
  * Ed Harris (""Pain & Gain"") Shawn Maguire will do anything to avenge his son, even though he knows he ""went wrong.""
  * Boyd Holbrook (""The Skeleton Twins"") Shawn's son Danny depends on his father to bail him out once more; this time from some  cut-throat Albanians.
  * Jelani Robert Joseph in his first role, is Marcus, a fatherless youngster who looks to Mike for guidance. He is in a position to really help Mike.
  * Common (""Selma"") Mr. Price is the fellow to call when someone is tough to kill. He ALWAYS delivers!
  * Vincent D'Onofrio (""The Judge"") Detective Harding is the only cop Jimmy trusts, even though he has been trying to arrest him for years.

The foreshadowing is painted with such broad and obvious strokes, it was hard to sit through, but as I said, the last 10 minutes pay off.",1426464000,9,1965,4.610951008645533
7063040,4,B00UNONQSQ,"When Jimmy Conlan kills the son of his best friend, Shawn Maguire, both Conlan and his son Michael are on the run. The evidence is piling on Michael as Danny Maguires killer and Jimmy does everything he can to protect his son before Maguires men or police get to him first. The film is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown & Non-Stop) and stars Liam Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnamen, and Boyd Holbrook.

Its Liam Neeson for crying out loud and hes back for another crime action film. If it hasn't been stated enough the actor is becoming type-cast for these kinds of roles. And I have to say that Run All Night was a lot of fun. Now mind you the plot is straight to the point with Jim Conlan trying to keep his son alive while being hunted down by the cops and Maguires assailants. The chemistry between LIam and Joel Kinnamen was great and you could feel for both of them considering their relationship is close to non-existent. Michael has a tough time forgiving his father for the life of crime he committed. They rebuild that trust over the course of the movie but not without its challenges.

The pacing of the movie really kept you on your toes because there was constant action; including foot chases, car jackings, and a highly trained assassin on the look-out. Its everything youd want in an action movie that also includes a good amount of drama between a father and son. Ed Harris plays Jimmys close friend Shawn who after finding out that his son was killed he must do whats necessary for revenge. And considering Shawn may be the antagonist you do feel bad for him and his wife when they lose their son. Yes his son got into some bad business but anyone wishes they couldve done something different to change their kids life around for the better.

As good as the movie is you cant help but sense Liam Neeson playing the same person in every role hes in. The action was sometimes over the top and didn't always balance when the story would slow down. Characters would show up early on then disappear until they're needed. For example, Michael and Jimmy get caught inside an apartment building surrounded by police while a highly trained assassin shows up to the party to take them out. We don't see the assassin again until later on and when it happens your not surprised yet your also wondering if we shouldve seen more of the assassin throughout. He even came off more as the antagonist that can stand up to Jimmy rather then this friend Shawn.

Collet-Serra delivers here on the action and the fun as anyone will come out of the movie feeling satisfied. At some point, however, the repetitiveness will ware on audiences if it hasn't happened already. Neeson has said itll be two more years before he retires from action films so we better enjoy it while it lasts. On a comparison scale, Id put Run All Night ahead of A Walk Among The Tombstones (review here) from an entertainment perspective. However, they each have their own qualities that people can enjoy with Neeson taking charge like he always has.",1426377600,2,3024,4.57380073800738
7063041,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Over half a decade has elapsed since the inauguration of the Era of Liam Neeson, now 62, as Improbable Action Hero, and audiences have perhaps grown a tad tired of the venerable Schindler's List actor's genre endeavors, but any exhaustion should be set aside long enough to embrace Run All Night, a well-acted, swiftly paced, and stylish action/suspense contraption set over the course of a single (rather eventful and violent) night in the five boroughs of NYC.  The storyline sounds more complicated and confusing on paper than it is in motion.  Put simply, a series of coincidences, confrontations, and encounters turn a pair of fathers, previously best friends with lives intertwined by organized-crime complicity, into instant archenemies, and their just-ignited blood feud will be resolved by sunrise.  One is an alcoholic hit man played with empty eyes and an exhausted step by Neeson in a now-characteristic, but still poignant and riveting performance.  The other is a well-tailored former kingpin turned almost-legitimate entrepreneur played by Ed Harris with a vise-grip intensity expressed largely through his eyes.

The acting titans share a handful of dynamic dialogue-driven sequences, reflecting on their shared history, weighing the state of their twilight years against the various regrets and sins of their youth.  Their interaction lends gravity, respectability, and emotional authenticity to this muscular, smartly executed series of nocturnal pulp set pieces, including an old-fashioned car chase and a multiple-shooter extravaganza in a crowded public-housing apartment building.  It is a very exciting and involving picture, straight and true.  The only notable flaw is a peripheral character played by hip-hop mainstay and part-time actor Common.  With his laser-sight handgun grip, night-vision eyepiece, and force-of-nature resolve (HE WILL!  NOT!  STOP!), he registers as type of comic-strip character, or a Terminator, and is therefore out of place in a film otherwise populated by all-too-human Irish American bruisers and lugs.",1426291200,,2058,5.627831715210356
7063042,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Run All Night centers around a retired, boozing hit man (Neeson) who's limousine driving son (Robocop's Joel Kinnaman) ends up on the wrong side of the Mob headed by Ed Harris' Boss character for reasons I won't reveal. It spurs the action forward, as Neeson pulls off a very entertaining and fun to watch night lit street chase with lots of high speed smashing and crashing that goes on for a good few minutes. Soon after, all heck breaks loose as the Mob and the entire police force are on a desperate search to kill or capture these renegades on the run, with plenty of satisfying movie action, shootouts and hand to hand fights. The ending kept me satisfied along with the grim but entertaining story, with most questions answered about the duo's decisions through the danger filled night of NYC, where every turn could end up as their last. Nick Nolte makes a surprise appearance as Kinnaman's uncle. Though the story has good pacing and well shot action, it is smart enough to take a breather and reflect on the father son strained connection, as Neeson tries to repair the damage he's caused his son.",1426291200,,1107,4.653061224489796

Shawn then makes it his vow to kill both Micheal and Jimmy in retaliation. Jimmy tells Micheal that he only needs to follow his orders for one night and then they can go their separate ways again, Jimmy goes the night protecting Micheal thru a hail of bullets all over NYC.

It was an ok movie. The father/son interaction and not being able to forgive was the over arching premise. Although the action was good, the storyline didn't quite draw me in. The son's need to blame his father for everything that went wrong in his life seemed a little over the top.

Jimmy's (Neeson) son, Michael, is a chauffeur who takes Ed Harris' son, Shawn, and his friend out. During the drive Shawn kills someone and Michael sees it. Shawn chases down Michael but Jimmy kills Shawn in order to save Michael.

I enjoyed the plot, its tension, and suspense.  Neeson plays a mob hit man who is tired of all of his killings, even bothered by them in nightmares. He wants to quit. However he is drawn back into this life when his son witnesses a murder by the son of the gang leader, Ed Harris, who happens to be Neeson's best friend. The gang leaders son tries to kill Neesons son, but Neeson saves his son by killing him. Now the gang leader wants revenge against both Neeson and his son. Neeson tells his son that he will resolve the problem during the night, hence the name of the film. An important subplot is that Neesons son does not want to have anything to do with his mobster father. A less significant subplot is that a good cop  there are many bad ones in the film  wants Neeson to reveal all of the many people he killed.",1463875200,,965,4.17741935483871

7063147,3,B00UNONQSQ,"That line above was uttered by the movie's big bad, longtime Brooklyn mob boss Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris), as his sanctum sanctorium was moments away from a violent visit from Jimmy ""the Gravedigger"" Conlon (Neeson), once Shawn's best friend and go-to button man but today his archnemesis. You could say 2015's RUN ALL NIGHT is a holiday movie in that it takes place during Christmastime. It also keeps on Neeson's latter day career as a badass geriatric action hero.

Nowadays, the Gravedigger plays the marginalized henchman, often times deep into his cups and getting pushed around by the mob boss's appalling son. Jimmy Conlon himself has got progeny, his estranged son Michael (Joel Kinnaman), the limo driver, who wants nothing to do with him, who means to keep him away from his wife and two young daughters. And maybe things would've kept on keeping on in the same fashion if only Michael hadn't witnessed a murder in the streets. So, now, here's the Gravedigger torn between allegiances. Does he stay loyal to his mob that just put a hit on the limo driver? Or does he go about trying to mend fences with a son who absolutely abhors him and his seedy past?

RUN ALL NIGHT presents a dose of high octane gloom and doom. The atmosphere is bleak, and you can sense that air of dark inevitability just wafting along. Neeson is one hundred and sixty-three years old but damn if he still doesn't project that potent presence. He is a spry pensioner that kicks beaucoup a--. I'm not even mad at him for cashing in on the momentum of his recent bout of action flicks. Neeson is featured in robust action sequences, most of it dealing in lead, but some of it nifty hand-to-hand combat. Matching him in intensity is Ed Harris who himself isn't shabby with the glowering and seething and generating that sense of uncompromising menace.

If there were one nagging thing about this movie, it has to be Jimmy's son, and it's a problem I have with the character itself rather than the acting which I thought was fine. I tried hard to sympathize with him - because his grievance against his da is legit - but I wonder if Neeson is so damn likable that it undermines the son? In my eyes, Michael comes off as such a sulking, ungrateful son. I had to keep reminding myself, dude just wants to keep his assassinating pops away from his own fam. I mustn't get mad at him. I kept getting mad at him.

Kudos to Vincent D'Onofrio as the one cop the Gravedigger feels he can sort of trust and to Common as the ice-cold contract killer who channels the Terminator in that he just keeps on coming. Bruce McGill, who I like a lot in RIZZOLI & ISLES, lends a solid background presence as the mob boss's faithful lieutenant. Anyway, can the Gravedigger and his son survive the night? Can they circumvent the harmful intent of a vengeful mob and corrupt cops and contract killers? C'mon, man, it's mama-efffin' Bryan Mills they're messing with. Oh, wait, it's not. 3 out of 5 stars for this one. Maybe 3.5, tops, for me.",1458518400,,2998,4.577281191806332

7063201,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Run All Night stars the always adrenaline-pumped Liam Neeson as a hero, this time fighting to protect his son (Joel Kinnaman) from mobsters (Ed Harris and his son Boyd Holbrook) while investigators/detectives are hot on Liam's tail (Vincet D'Onofrio in particular- hey this guys presence reminds me of how much I miss those Law & Order shows that he played in!  Best Law & Order actor ever).  Also worth noting is that Liam and his son don't get along at all, and there's friction between the two due to past events that made the two go their separate ways.

The movie is dark and rather violent like a good mobster film is supposed to be.  Lots of shootings, plots to kill, etc.  The acting is extremely good all around too.  At first Liam doesn't seem like the unstoppable/untouchable hero that we know him for (*ahem* Taken *ahem!*) because he has his own problems and guilt concerning mob and family issues, but eventually when the chase is on -and he and his son Boyd are running around all night avoid dangerous mobsters- the Liam we know and love blossoms!

The picture quality is really dark but never enough to be a distraction.  It goes without saying given the people who star in this movie that it's terrific, and the action being constant throughout only enhances the story and makes me appreciate the movie more.  Great film!  Not sure why I can't quite give it a 5 star rating.  Perhaps because it can be a little confusing and hectic in the beginning with all sorts of people shooting and we don't yet know who's the good guys from the bad early on (and plus some of the writing is a bit contrived).  I also don't want to mislead you into thinking this is strictly an action/suspense film.  No, it also has atmosphere and drama related to the conversations Ed Harris and Liam Neeson have.  Highly worth watching!",1449273600,,1828,4.584615384615384

7063208,5,B00UNONQSQ,"Although I have seen this story-line in other films, I enjoyed the plot again and its tension and suspense. All of the actors were great, especially Liam Neeson who is great in all of his action films. Neeson plays a mob hit man who is tired of all of his killings, even bothered by them in nightmares. He wants to quit. However he is drawn back into this life when his son witnesses a murder by the son of the gang leader, Ed Harris, who happens to be Neeson's best friend. The gang leaders son tries to kill Neesons son, but Neeson saves his son by killing him. Now the gang leader wants revenge against both Neeson and his son. Neeson tells his son that he will resolve the problem during the night, hence the name of the film. An important subplot is that Neesons son does not want to have anything to do with his mobster father. A less significant subplot is that a good cop  there are many bad ones in the film  wants Neeson to reveal all of the many people he killed.",1448150400,2,974,4.231182795698925

It's always fight watching Neeson kick a whole lotta butt and Ed Harris is also enjoyable to watch in just about any role he tackles, Although Run All Night has no Oscar intentions and is nothing terribly original, it does what a good thriller/action flick should do and that is entertain.  Sure, it's mostly ridiculous, but I don't care.  It delivers a lot for what it is.  I don't worry about what it isn't.",1445644800,,586,4.429906542056075

I am also more than a bit put off by the hypocrisy of this guy making guns, killer movies with these enormous body-counts only to tell the media he hates guns and that he thinks people who own them are evil cretins.

7063381,5,B00UNONQSQ,"Michael Connelly  is a limo driver who's in the wrong place at the wrong time when he witnesses the murder of two drug dealers by the son of a local mobster after they try to recover money given him in a deal that fell through. Michael's estranged father, Jimmy, is hit man for the murderer's father and convinces his son to keep quiet. Unfortunately the son decides to make certain Michael won't talk and JImmy kills him in self-defense. Immediately, he finds himself and his son on the run, from the vengeful father, his former boss and friend, as well as the police.

This story of extreme paternal love is one continuous chase scene with plenty of violence and a remarkable number of good shots by Jimmy and the men chasing him.  Though his friend admits his son did wrong--indeed was stupid--both in attempting a drug deal which he refuses to accept, as well as trying to kill Michael, his love for his only child demands he extract vengeance and he acts accordingly. With crooked cops on his tail, as well as his fellow henchmen, Jimmy turns to the one good cop he feels he can trust though it means prison or worse.

The entire story is a flashback, ending where it began with the inevitable and expected finish but a batch of cinematic thrills in between. There are deft camera angles, extreme zoom in and outs, and artistic, if bloody, scenes.  The end credits are especially noteworthy and interesting.

Good if you like thrills, and non-stop action.

A retired mob hit man longs to connect with his son and that son's new young family, but the son wants nothing to do with him.  Then the son becomes the target of a thug and the hit man has to make one last kill and save his son's life.  Of course that one last kill, happens to be the spoilt rich kid son of his former mob boss.  Hit man pleads with mob boss that his son had nothing to do with this and lets him know if he tries to kill his son, the body count is going to get pretty high and he might have to come for him too.  The mob boss of course doesn't see the logic in this and throws all his resources at having the hit man's son killed

Run All Night overall though was pretty entertaining.  It certainly didn't break any new ground but it was a lot of fun going over that often tread on ground, and this film retells the classic plot better than most.",1440201600,,956,3.922279792746114

7063615,5,B00UNONQSQ,"The preview for ""Run All Night"" reminded me of the movie ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" for it's in-your-face depiction of another part of the Crimeworld. I knew many of the areas in Boston in TFEC. I was living in Boston and Charlestown in the '70's. Crime and criminals were all around me, even as I attended a local community college, as the poorest of work-study students; living in a one-room studio, in a gritty, seedy, brownstone in Monument Square. $50 a week for work-study; $30 for rent and $20 dollars for the rest of the week. The best light in the room was when I opened the refrigerator because it was usually empty. Sharing a bathroom with at least two other people. Cockroaches usually passed me by because there was nothing for them to work on. Hearing an ex-wrestler in his weekly shakedown of the building super and his wife. Wondering why there was so much screaming and yelling going in the apartment above me. Figuring out the loud ""thumps!"" were the body of the super being knocked to the floor by the ex-wrestler for some reasons of there not being enough money for the burly man with a heavy Eastern accent.  The NYC locales of ""Run All Night"" were very similar to many to places in Boston and Charlestown. Run-down neighborhoods; houses close together; alleys everywhere leading to nowhere or a life of crime. In RAN Liam Neeson was desperate to keep his son out of ""the life."" I identified with the thin veils separating the crimeworld from the college world I was living in. You'd bump into all sorts of characters that could have come from either world at any time. There was no father to protect me from being dragged into the the Clan of Crime--only Common Sense and my wits kept me from that life. Yes, ""Run All Night"" gets 5 stars from me because it brought back so many memories of the wild times in Boston and Charlestown, Ma.. To many people, these movies may just be ""entertainment"" but to me, ""Run All Night"" and ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle"" are documentaries about the places I have been and about the places I escaped from...",1437955200,,2063,4.560646900269542

7063698,3,B00UNONQSQ,"Being a Liam Neeson fan, I look forward to seeing another effort from him.  In this case, a bit different role where instead of being the hero/good guy, he is more a washed up enforcer for the mob who would rather wash away his sorrows into a drink than do anything else.  Neeson and Ed Harris both put in gritty real performances in their respective roles.  The movie is a rough gritty type of action movie but is one of those that really doesnt bring anything new to the genre and tends to stick to a familiar formulaic plotline and story.  The story feels a bit muddled to me that kind of plods along through the first half with its uneven pacing.  I feel like something is missing in this to make it a really good film.  It is not a terrible movie at all as the performances of Neeson and Harris really make the movie but really is predictable in its ending and really could do a bit more in building the suspense and drama with a bit better written story.

7063702,3,B00UNONQSQ,"My brain was spinning like a ferris wheel. The actors were great and the setup hooked me in, but it got out of control after that. When Neeson killed the cop I lost a lot of faith in his character as he didn't think twice about it. The action was shot really well and the movie was never dull but at some point I just didn't care about the father/son plot since the dad killed anyone who looked at him wrong. Every scene someone seemed to get brutally killed like Neeson was Jason or something.  I'm no prude when it comes to action movies and love the genre, but this had an ugly tone underneath. It comes down to reasoning for me, in Taken, he had a legitimate purpose to shoot since the thugs had already done so much harm to so many people. In Run All Night Liam pops off anybody in his path before they even throw a punch.  He just became the villain. I think if his kid had been on the run with him and they were dodging the gangs bullets at every turn, then by all means plug'em.  I do like this director and the style of his camera movements.",1437350400,,1050,4.11219512195122

This was a character driven story which probed father and son and friendship issues in a world of violence and greed which poisoned even the sincerest relationship. The tragic story was heightened by a moral awareness that those we call family redeem our lives when they seem hopelessly lost. The ending is honest, brutal, but uplifting in its moral lesson about family love prevailing.

7063918,5,B00UNONQSQ,"'IT ENDS TONIGHT ! - 'LIAM NEESON' ON FORM IN THIS THRILLER'
Mobsters Hit-Man 'Jimmy Conlon' (Liam Neeson) now aged 55 and long-time friend of Mob-Boss 'Shawn Maguire'(Ed Harris)
was once known as the 'Gravedigger' ......but is now haunted by the past, he drinks too much, and has hit a low-ebb in life.....
His relationship with son 'Mike' (Joel Kinnaman) is non-existent.......
For 30 years NYPD Cop 'John Harding' (Vincent D'Onofrio) has been trying to nail 'Jimmy' but has always been one-step behind.
When 'Mike' witnesses 'Shawn's' out of control son 'Danny' (Boyd Holbrook) kill someone, 'Mike's' life is under threat, 'Jimmy'
wants to keep his estranged son safe, he'll need a clear head to do so, 'Mike' will not want his fathers help but as events turn
out, both 'Jimmy' and his son become a target, 'Shawn' wants to even the score, and tells 'Jimmy' so face to face.
When 'Mike' is taken into custody, 'Jimmy' knows things don't feel right, he has to spring his son.
The two now become hunted by both the police led by 'John Harding' and indeed 'Shawn' and his heavily armed hoods...
'Shawn' decides to hire the ruthless and efficient professional hit-man 'Andrew Price' (Common) confident that he won't stop
until he completes the task.
'Mike's' immediate priority is to ensure his wife and children are out of danger....
Now the chase is on, it's going to be a long night.
This is 'Liam Neeson' at the top of his game.......with car-chases, fire-fights, hand to hand and often brutal combat sequences....
...all coming together to make this a heart-pounding, edge of your seat action-packed roller-coaster ride.
The violence is often graphic and there is frequent use of colourful language...
Great Picture and Sound Quality.

7064015,3,B00UNONQSQ,"THE FILM: I saw RUN ALL NIGHT in theaters during my Spring Break, and remember feeling pretty OK about it at the time. It certainly wasn't boring, by any stretch of the imagination. Now having seen it for the second time, without the rose-colored glasses of being in a theater, I feel like it's not Liam Neeson's strongest outing in a genre that's quickly become his own. It certainly doesn't lack for good performances and action, but the characters and situations were rather weak. There was also too many plot threads given the storyline and none of them were really given enough time to develop, even at nearly two hours. Far and away the best members of the cast were Liam Neeson and Ed Harris. Despite expecting the audience to take away that they were long-time best friends on so little, the grizzled appearances and speech patterns adequately suggested a lived-in friendship and the effect of living a hard life. Joel Kinnaman was OK as Liam Neeson's son, but falters somewhat in the more dramatic, intimate moments. Vincent D'Onofrio also has a glorified cameo as one of the few good cops, but he wasn't really given much to do. Common also has a small role as a hired assassin, but his was one of the few parts that probably could have been left out. The action, however, was quite good when it happened. There was a good balance of hand-to-hand combat and gun-play that was shot fairly well. The R rating also helped because there wasn't a need to obscure the more graphic aspects. Lastly, the score was OK insofar as it didn't get in the way of the story. It was quite forgettable otherwise. Overall, it seems like Liam Neeson might be getting tired of doing this whole ""action star"" bit. He should probably get out while the quality is relatively good (barring the two TAKEN sequels). The performances and action are good, but the story is a bit overstuffed and the pacing makes it kind of a chore to sit through at times. Recommended if you like Liam Neeson's action movies, but honestly there are a number of them to pick before I'd choose this one again.

THE EXTRAS; There isn't too much in the way of special features here, but I didn't really expect a lot either. Half of the material is contained in two short featurettes, totaling about 17 minutes. The first, SHOOT ALL NIGHT, goes into some detail on how the film was shot (at night, primarily). While the story wasn't particularly original or special, it was nice to see that there was a decent amount of on-location shooting in New York to lend the film some authenticity. The second featurette focuses on Liam Neeson and his character, Jimmy. This is the third film that Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra have done together, and the ease of working together is there and present (to a degree) onscreen. It's also quite obvious that the cast had fun working together. Following these two featurettes are about 16 minutes worth of deleted/extended scenes. None of them came across as particularly essential (and therefore worthy of being cut), but they did provide some extra screen time and dramatic moments for a few characters who didn't have much of it in the finished film. My favorite was the first one, the full flashback of Jimmy (Neeson) killing a certain character who is an important plot point, and which segues into Jimmy waking up at the bar.

OVERALL: RUN ALL NIGHT might not have too much in the way of originality, but Liam Neeson yet again proves he's a decent, and believable, action star. All of the actors look like they're at least having fun working with each other. Too bad it didn't translate into a more engaging thriller. The special features, while not exhaustive, were at least enough to whet my appetite given the quality and depth of the film. Liam Neeson fans will probably want to pick this up; it might be worth a rental for everyone else.",1435708800,,3848,4.6656848306332845

Parts of the film are, unfortunately, too dark and make it difficult for the viewer to appreciate the actions.  However, it is worth watching as

5. Bad guys out to even the score when leader/boss loses his badasss son to #2 above.
6. Also involved are baddies from, guess where, Eastern Europe, and specifically the rarely used, but still been used - Albanians. The Italians and Syrians must be feeling pretty lonely this past decade or so.
7. Dad and son team up to dispatch all but the final scene where it takes a really poorly believable yet predictable final shot. Ahhh, the accuracy of a very unstable and barely alive person with a rifle.

7064132,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Liam Neeson is a retired Irish-mob enforcer/hitman, Jimmy Conlon aka the Gravedigger, who drinks a lot to dull the pain. His son (played by Joel Kinnaman) is a legit limo driver and doesn't want to associate with his dad. Ed Harris is the retired, and now sort-of legit, mob boss, Shawn Maguire. His son (played by Boyd Holbrook) has lots of issues and a bad plan. Through an interesting set of circumstances involving their sons, Conlon and Maguire are now at each other's throats in a deadly blood feud. There's also another professional killer, Common, hired to kill Conlon. There are, at times, lots of cops, some on the mob payroll. One good cop, Vincent D'Onofrio, has tried to put Conlon away for 3 decades for what he believes are 17 murders. There are some good chase scenes, in cars and on foot. And, lots of action. And a twist at the end. The film is also about honor and family and what one man will do to achieve redemption.",1435104000,,938,4.523529411764706

But I was disappointed in this film which I missed in the theater. The dialog was HORRIBLE.  Now that I have got that out of my system the action sequences were very good and there was plenty of them. The storyline was very good also, but the execution of that storyline was not. If this was a silent movie I would have enjoyed it so much more. The acting was very good and Oh by the way did I mention plenty of action, gun fights, car chases, hand to hand and foot chases. I will watch this film again but I will have my headphones on while listening to some of my favorite music.

In this case the son is an adult, but still.  The mob boss even hires an assassin (Common instead of Jude Law) whose face gets messed up and there's a final shootout at a house by a lake.

I'm used to this Hollywood polished film making style. It had all the polished features of a very decent Hollywood type film. It lacked that something extra, let's say the whole film was not exactly scripted to really keep me on the edge of my seat because of the lack of originality, BUT, it wasn't entirely boring and everyone involved with this film did a very professional job, which I like.
When watching this type of film, which involves as many themes to draw as many people as possible to watch this film, there's almost always lacking that touch of genius that makes films that have that last throughout the ages as pieces of art.
In a land of filmmaking that uses demographics to get films made instead of originality, this film still delivered its promise to deliver the bang bang theme and add some little touches of emotional dramas , at least enough to be somewhat engaging.

7064188,3,B00UNONQSQ,"Run All Night stars Liam Neeson as Jimmy Conlon, a man who attempts to protect his son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) from mobster Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). Both Conlon and Maguire go way back to their days in Brooklyn. Condon, once a hit man for the mob, has turned to booze as a way to blot out unpleasant memories of his past while Maguire aspires to lead a decent middle-class life. Their paths cross when Jimmy kills Shawns son in self-defense during a heroin deal gone bad. Shawn vows vengeance.

Liam Neeson has etched out a comfortable niche for himself since Taken as the guy with a mysterious past whose background comes in handy when his family is threatened, hes forced to suppress personal demons to save others, or new circumstances force him into confrontation. Run All Night falls well within those plot parameters and the movie would be pretty much a been there, seen that picture were it not for two fine actors duking it out dramatically. Neeson and Harris deliver the goods, even though they're not working with the sharpest of scripts. Director Jaume Collet-Serra manages some snappy scenes between these two veterans, but is less successful staging action sequences, which have a routine look and fail to elicit a lot of excitement or tension.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a making-of featurette, profile of Liam Neeson, and deleted scenes. There is also a digital HD copy.",1434412800,,1409,4.842323651452282

7064190,4,B00UNONQSQ,"'Run All Night' is a tough film with plenty of action. In fact much of the action will have you on the edge of your seat. Rooting for the good guys who may be the bad guys, it is all convoluted.

Liam Neeson, plays Jimmy Conlon,  a has been mob enforcer.  In fact so bad he has dreams of the people he killed. he worked for the toughest of the mob, Shawn Maguire, played by Ed Harris. Jimmy wakes up in a bar, and just starts drinking again. He now scrounges money from Shawns son Danny, played terrifically by Boyd Holbrook. Hence the tough guy is now a laughing stock. He had a family he never paid much attention to. His son, Mike, played by Joel Kinnaman. Kinnaman was the driving force detective in the series, 'The Killing'.  He us living the straight life, working as a limo driver. He has a wife and two children.

So, here are the players. Danny has mixed with an Albanian mob to bring drugs into his father's business. Dad wants nothing to do with it and says no. Danny is in big trouble, and when the Albanian mob shows up that night, all Hell breaks loose. Mike is the chauffeur test drove the Albanians to Danny's office. He gets mixed up in the fireworks, and he and his father, Jimmy take off. The film centers around Shawn McGuire's hunt for both Mike and Jimmy, and the FBI looking for all of them. A very tense action oriented film, with tough guys, violence gore and grits. If this is your forte, than this film is for you.

There is action and story and great acting to keep it entertaining. The biggest problem that I had with it has to do with Liam Neeson. I have always liked him and thought he was one of the best actors working today. This movie signals the end of that way of my thinking. The scene with him and Ed Harris at the restaurant reminded me of the Pacino/De Niro scene in Heat. That scene aside Neeson is starting to become generic and hard to watch. Every movie he does it the same and this may finally be the movie that makes me think twice about watching anymore movies with him. Overall, not a bad movie at all, but Im almost over Liam Neeson in action movies. I disappointingly give this a B-.",1434326400,,1116,4.293838862559242

7064225,3,B00UNONQSQ,"Following two thrillers Unknown and Non-Stop, Run All Night marks the director Jaume Collet-Serras third collaboration with the star Liam Neeson. But don't expect a big surprise or twisty narrative here because Run All Night is a thriller with an orthodox narrative featuring a father-son relationship plot.

Liam Neeson plays an alcoholic New York gangster Jimmy Conlon, who has to protect his estranged son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) from Jimmys old friend and gangster Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). Car chases and shoot-outs ensue.

The film's cast includes Common, Vincent D'Onofrio, Boyd Holbrook, Bruce McGill and Gnesis Rodrguez as well as Nick Nolte in a cameo role.

As the title suggests, Run All Night features a few extended cat-and-mouse scenes. They are competently done against the backdrop of the beautifully shot night streets of New York City, but the action stunts themselves not particularly new in terms of style. Also, the film has a convoluted story which needs more interesting characters to hold it all together.

Run All Night is an old-school action thriller. The thriller loses steam in its second half, but still is a fairly thrilling ride.",1431820800,2,1160,5.18716577540107
7064226,4,B00UNONQSQ,"If you like a good solid nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thriller this it one. Sure its somewhat formulaic, but when did that ever stop Ed Harris and Liam Neeson from giving us 100% pure excitement? The aspect of long deep friendship is refreshing in that they took the time to develop and explore it so we could too. As it wraps itself around family, things digress and begin to unravel and in a way that is like a slow burning fuse until BAM - you're in the middle of it with one of the best car chases to date. The dirty cops, corruption, graphic brain and blood splatter, profanity, drug-dealing are all part of these new Hollywood films written for demographics instead of pure story telling (this one from Warner brothers) which pretty much illuminates the audience's lust for such a blatant lack of imagination. All in all its a good job and has a redeeming resonance to it.",1431648000,,880,4.611464968152866
7064227,5,B00UNONQSQ,I love this movie,1429920000,2,17,3.5
7064228,5,B00UNONQSQ,"Run All Night (2015) is a non-stop-action drama along the lines of Cold in July (2014) meets any of the action packed Liam Neeson films like: Taken trilogy, Non-Stop (2014), or Unknown (2011).  Together with A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014) this must be my favorite film with Neeson to this day.  I did like him in Unknown (2011), the original Taken (2008), The Grey (2011), and in the Five Minutes of Heaven (2009), but it is with the character of Jimmy Conlon at the age of 63 that Neeson made the biggest impression on me so far.  In the film, Neeson portrays an over-the-hill ex-trigger man for an Irish-American mobster gone legit played by Ed Harris (something similar Harris played in the film History of Violence in 2005).  Conlon is a washed-up alcoholic with no real friends and money, who keeps hanging around Shawn McGuire (Harris) and his family, because his own son does not want to know him.  But when certain unforeseen circumstances occur, and Conlon's son becomes unintentionally a witness to McGuire's son dirty business handling...emotions take over, bad feelings transpire, and soon the fathers who have been friends since forever find themselves at war...who will emerge a winner at the end of the night? watch and find out...a great anti-hero film.",1429228800,53,1273,4.902325581395349
7064229,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Actor Liam Neeson has been in quite a few action films over the past couple of years; and I do enjoy seeing him in action movies. And finally, I will review the movie Run All Night.

Jimmy who is currently at a bar, decides to go and ask a guy by the name of Danny for a loan of $800. Danny only agrees to the loan if Jimmy will dress up as Santa Claus at Danny's father Shawn's house. Later Jimmy's son Mike (who is a boxer/limo driver) witnesses Danny commit a despicable crime. All this and much more leads to Danny coming into Mike's home prepared to finish him off, but a bullet fired by someone neither Mike nor Danny expected to see, causes a battle between two former friends in the film Run All Night.

Liam Neeson doesn't quite have the same sharpness he has in the Taken movies, but for Run All Night that is not a bad thing. Proving he's still a worthy action star, Neeson portrays Jimmy Conlon as a man with a strained relationship with his son, a slight alcoholic, and at times a dirty sense of humor. But Jimmy goes to great lengths to keep his son alive and overall, I was pleased with Neeson's performance. Actor Ed Harris does a fine job here too as Shawn Maguire. To describe his character would be: exact in his decisions, and surprisingly ruthless. Joel Kinnaman stars as Mike Conlon, while actor/rapper Common portrays Mr. Price and I think they did really well.

Run All Night is executed really well both in terms of action and storytelling. And while it may not be a perfect movie nor the best action film ever, Run All Night is a likable film due to the actors, the pacing and timing of the story, and the bold action sequences. I had a fun time watching Run All Night and I consider this movie to be

A Good Experience

Rated R

7064230,4,B00UNONQSQ,"Jimmy (Liam Neeson) is an old hitman who can't sleep, seeing the faces of those that he killed. He lives his life alone smoking cigarettes and drinking scotch. His BFF and old boss is Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris) who is now an honest businessman, while his son, Danny (Boyd Holbrook) is not. Events happen in which Jimmy's estranged son Michael (Joel Kinnaman) becomes a target for Shawn.

Jimmy aids his son as they ""Run All Night"" ....and part of the morning too, although that would have made an awkward title.

For those of you felt taken in ""Taken 3"" Liam plays a similar character, without the electronics. It is action filled with car chases, building fires, minor roof jumping, and plenty of gun action.

Whether he was a drunk Santa, a lost remorseful hitman, a protective father, ultimate heroic sharpshooter, I loved it . This is one of his best action movies to date. Would buy 2 copies in case one gets lost. Lol.  Love for a son, loyalty to a blood brother, which to choose. This squeezes out all the right pathos for this unlikely hero throughout, even to the very end.  This is not Taken , as in same old story . Rather, about love and loyalties and doing the right thing, Jimmy Conlon, Liam's angst character, gets it all right in the end. Beautiful story. Love conquers all. The drunk Santa part ...

7064233,4,B00UNONQSQ,"This is a superior gangster/ action thriller movie.

The story starts in a straightforward way: two gangsters are friends; both have sons; one of the gangsters kills the other's (morally bankrupt) son to save his own son's life; the other gangster seeks revenge.

Then, there's a dedicated police detective trying to bring the killer to justice.

The interplay between the characters is finely crafted, bringing credibility and an air of originality to the story - which could easily have become cliched.

The acting from the experienced ensemble cast is excellent: Liam Neeson and Ed Harris are perfectly cast as the friends who become vengeful foes.

If you like this genre, I am confident that you will find this movie to be very satisfying.",1427500800,6,744,5.016260162601626

7064235,4,B00UNONQSQ,"This was by far one of the few movies I've seen in recent months that I absolutely enjoyed every minute of in theaters - to my utmost surprise. It is Liam Neeson's best action movie in a very long time - and blows the socks off any of the garbage ""Taken 2/3"" Hollywood cash-grab sequels that are purely for money. Yes this does have some awesome action/chase/fight scenes, but at heart this is definitely not a ""Taken"" film - this is a hard-hitting raw family drama similar to Warrior with all the grit and raw street-ugliness of NARC (and then some). It's a mile-a-minute thrill ride shot brilliantly and has plenty of heart. You really do feel like you are watching these characters and this world Run All Night. Tone-wise, this film is perfect and I couldn't have asked for a more appropriate and darker-looking treatment. The cinematography, the film palette, the raw look and feel just made this all the more serious to watch - excellent. Acting was stellar and relationships were very heartfelt between all characters, not only between legends Ed Harris and Liam Neeson as blood brothers who deliver some power-house scenes, but also between Liam Neeson's estranged character Jimmy Conolon and the relationship he desperately seeks with his son Michael, played by Joel Kinnaman. The son has every right to despise him and you really feel for him as he struggles dealing the sins of his father into his loving home and affectionate wife and kids, all of which are now in jeopardy. The fight scenes and chase sequences were excellent, and I was making all kinds of expressions when fists were thrown and punches were landed. The tension in this film really made me cringe and hold my breath at least three times in the film. The pacing is just fantastic - never a dull moment, and enough pauses in the film to reflect on more character development to flesh out these characters and feel their relationships unfold between each other. The last ten minutes of the film stuck with me beyond the credits, which I also sat through just to reflect on the ride my friend and I went through. 4/5 only because it had HUGE potential to be even greater but ran into familiar tropes and the movie had a hard time deciding what it wanted to be from the developed beginning as a character study of the main character or a fast cat and mouse game. It COULD have been awesome had it just taken the time to develop things a little more and not feel so rushed or checking off boxes.

8707653,4,B00UNONQSQ,"This is a competent thriller with a surprisingly high caliber cast. It's problem, and perhaps it's strength, is that it doesn't try too hard. There certainly is  potential for a sharper script and deeper character work, but that might have just bogged down the pace or bungled the whole thing altogether. Also, the plot is staged on a near impossible coincidence. Again, could have been remedied by some early ground work. Watching it, you really can't help but wonder if there's a more thoughtful crime drama in here (which is totally a compliment). BUT, you know what? It's still a pretty fun movie.
