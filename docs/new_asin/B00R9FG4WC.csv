8694642,2,B00R9FG4WC,"When I was young, I purchased ""Mind Blowin'"" by Vanilla Ice (1994) and it was so TERRIBLE that my friends laughed at me until I eventually had to just roll with it. I even took the initiative and mocked myself while accepting the abuse I suffered with a smile.  This helped to quell the shame I felt.at making such a POOR DECISION/PURCHASE and eventually, I put it behind me..
-Nothing I learned from that experience... not even the passage of time, could have prepared me for the complete error in judgement buying this ""Roast"" DVD has turned out to be.  I don't know how to begin to offer a reasonable criticism.  It's just so poorly conceived and painfully executed that by the end, I actually thought about the amount of character I was building to have stuck with it.  The sound sucks and the video footage is even worse.  By the time Jim Cornette took the mic, he seemed as close to ASHAMED as possible for a man who has spent the majority of his life ""selling"" the wide variety of bits and angles his career has included.
I may never forgive myself for actually spending money I honestly earned on this disaster and you can bet I'll never forget those invovled in producing it...",1428624000,,1186,4.497674418604651
