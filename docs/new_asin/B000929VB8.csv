8056666,5,B000929VB8,"I've seen alot of anime show but this one by far is the best one out there. I was out of my seet most of the time. I would defenetly recomend it to anyone who likes action, fantasy, comedy, drama, or even romance. The graphics are really good and its hard to find an anime show w/ it so hurry up and get it. But you should probably read the books first though.",1132790400,,360,3.9452054794520546
8056667,4,B000929VB8,"Brought to us from Gonzo Studio (Full Metal Panic, etc.), they bring the much loved manga series ""Chrono Crusade"" by Daisuke Moriyama, to life. While the anime series is not exactly like the manga itself, I believe that Gonzo is doing a good job so far with the series.

Reaching the climatic ending of the series, Rosette, Chrono and Azmaria begin their journey to San Fransisco to search for Joshua Christopher. Along the way, many things and plot twists come to pass, making the story even more twisting to the viewers mind.

The relationship between Rosette and Chrono deepens over the mighty night time view of San Fransisco and we also learn more of Stella, the jewel witch, and of her scared past. Aion, as always, makes appearances and reveals more about his plot to destroy the world.

Though this anime is not well seen by some of Moriyama's fans, I believe Gonzo has done a very good job capturing the world of Chrono Crusade. Presenting the characters we know and love from the manga, Gonzo has brought the humor we have come to know them for. The indepth story of the battle between hell, heaven, and earth is presented in such an intense fashion. Also, the anime is drawn with quality and time.

Any anime fan should give this series a try! Good work Gonzo, looking foreword to volume 6!",1116201600,,1301,4.619047619047619
