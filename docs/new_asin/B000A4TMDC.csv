8074509,5,B000A4TMDC,"While it's true that John Garfield had little or no respect for his many crime films, it's also true that he is best remembered for those crime films which I always enjoy to watch. 1939's ""Dust Be My Destiny"" was one of three crime movies that Warners Studio specially ""packaged"" for John Garfield during 1938 and 1939 in an attempt to add him to their already long list of movie gangsters. Garfield was reteamed with Priscilla Lane after the success of ""Four Daughters"" and ""Daughters Courageous"", and their great chemistry made ""Dust Be My Destiny"" perhaps their best movie together. Though the movie was another money-maker for Warners, Garfield, according to one biographer, thought the movie was ""dramatically sloppy"" and lacked ""personal drama"".

John Garfield plays Joe Bell, who is released from prison after serving time for a crime he didn't commit. Bitter and angry at society, he is soon arrested as a vagrant and sent off to a country work farm. It is there that he meets the lovely Mabel (Priscilla Lane), who happens to be the stepdaughter of the cruel, alcoholic foreman on the work farm. At first he wants nothing to do with the warm-hearted Mabel, but her kindness slowly wins his trust and they fall in love. One night when they're alone and kissing, Mabel's drunken stepfather discovers them and attacks Joe. During the fight, Mabel's stepfather dies from a sudden heart attack, and Mabel and Joe flee, knowing that they will be held responsible for his death.

Just as Joe suspected, the police blame him for the foreman's death, and he and Mabel are forced to lead the life of fugitives, moving from one shabby apartment to another as the police hotly pursue them. Finally fed up with their dangerous lifestyle, Mabel turns Joe into the police in a last desperate attempt to clear his name. But Joe is tried for murder, and it's up to his lawyer to convince the jury that Joe is not a menace to society. Joe remains angry at the world for the unfair treatment he's gotten in life, and he shows his hatred for the ""uncaring"" jurors. His lawyer then makes a passionate plea for his life and the lives of all misunderstood young men who're dealt a cruel hand by fate. Will Joe get his freedom and live happily with Mabel, or will the cruel injustice of society seal his fate? Watch and find out!

""Dust Be My Destiny"" is one of Garfield's best early films, yet it has become largely overlooked and forgotten over the years. It still hasn't been released on vhs or dvd yet, so be aware that any copies you buy now are strictly ""bootlegs"". Although slammed by both John Garfield and the critics, this underated classic is very entertaining and highly recommended. Let's hope that this movie, as well as ""Pride of the Marines"", ""He Ran All the Way"", ""Nobody Lives Forever"", ""Out of the Fog"", and several other classic John Garfield movies will be released on dvd soon.",1122940800,23,2884,4.695652173913044
