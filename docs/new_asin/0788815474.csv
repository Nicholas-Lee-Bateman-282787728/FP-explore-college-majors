77362,5,0788815474,"It is very difficult for me to express in writing what ""Beloved"" means to me.  I went to see this movie on October 16, 1998 with an audience who totally missed the point.  I have never heard more nervous laughter in my  life.  I proceeded to see the film once-a-week for the next four weeks (for  a total of five viewings) and continued to be disappointed by the audiences  with which I saw it.  I soon found a message board on the computer where  people were discussing their feelings regarding ""Beloved"" and quickly  realized that the problem with the audience was that they were allowing  their own ignorance and impatience to spoil what could have been an  infinitely moving cinematic experience for them.  The film's angriest  detractors were those who did not understand it and, upon hearing  explanations for what they did not understand, had to come to grips with  the idea that they did not want to understand it.  Contrary to what many  film critics said, the film does have an emotional release after its nearly  three hours of buildup.  The critics may not have paid enough attention to  find that release, but that does not mean that you won't.
A word of  caution to those who plan on renting this film, you MUST pay attention to  the ENTIRE movie.  Too many people half-ass their way through this film  without looking for the deeper meaning.  A deeper meaning which I found to  be as plain as the nose on one's face.  All of the clues to solving the  puzzle which is ""Beloved"" are provided by the film itself, if only one has  the patience and persistence too look for them.  When the film is over, if  you have paid attention, you will find that the moral of the story is one  that the generations that have spanned from that time to this must carry  with them.
As a final note, I would like to add that I am one of those  who believe this film was ridiculously snubbed by the Motion Picture  Academy.  How anyone could deny Kimberly Elise an award for her performance  as Denver is beyond me.  Contrary to the belief of many established film  critics and armchair critics alike, Denver is truly the character who holds  this film together and a lesser actress might have let that power run away  from her.  Elise provides the strongest acting performance in a film full  of unforgettable actors.  Beah Richards has the pleasure of playing the  most life-affirming character in the film, Danny Glover shines as Paul D,  Oprah Winfrey surprisingly defies assumption and delivers a powerful  performance, Lisa Gay Hamilton brings emotion and life to the young Sethe,  Thandie Newton brings just the right amount of otherworldly quality to her  role as the spirit of a child incarnate, but none of these come close to  the power and pensiveness of Kimberly Elise's Denver.
Please rent  ""Beloved.""  Please watch ""Beloved.""  Please give ""Beloved"" a chance.  This  film deserves to be seen and felt and enjoyed.  Allow ""Beloved"" into your  heart and mind and it will not soon go away.  Take my example.  I first saw  this film October 16, 1998, and still a day does not go by that it does not  haunt me.  I did not see a better film in 1998 and I believe I shall not  see a better film for many years to come.",923356800,6,3219,4.548330404217926

77404,5,0788815474,"This movie, about the ravages of slavery, is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. I had to stop watching it several times, and watch it over a period of a few days. It reminds me of some of the most difficult Bergman movies, like Cries and Whispers. It is hugely artistically ambitious, and the acting is superb.  Danny Glover and Oprah are excellent, as all the actors are. I do wish the editor had taken out some of the more graphic sequences, to reach a broader audience. This movie might make more sense to you if some serious tragedies have occurred in your life, in which case you might find the emotional chaos it portrays relatable, or even recognizable. But if your life has been placid and comfortable, you might find it scary. It is scary. But there is redemption and closure at the end, and optimism. I'm a huge fan of Toni Morrison and now I want to read Beloved again.",1493337600,2,895,4.424242424242424

77406,1,0788815474,I was embarrassed and ashamed on so many levels.  I wanted to show the storyline to my children since we'd just finished Uncle Tom's Cabin.  This movie did not at all stay true to the real life story of Margaret 'Peggy' Garner.  I cried and begged my kids' forgiveness (after fast forwarding through many scenes).  It was in no way the historic account that Mrs. Garner's life warranted.  I am truly disappointed and appalled.,1490486400,,426,4.702702702702703

77408,2,0788815474,"I'm reading Beloved with my students and thought I'd get the film to show a few scenes. This production made some very bad choices, the special effects are crap (including the mechanical dog in the opening sequence), and the sound is poorly engineered. One of the things that bugs me the most is that Denver isn't chubby. That really meant something to me when I read the book, that Denver's loneliness and Sethe's doting had fattened her up, and that Beloved's possessive curse gradually starves Denver and steals Sethe from her. That was deeply moving to me in Morrison's novel and this film doesn't help me care about Denver at all. Fail.",1480118400,,641,4.732142857142857

77505,5,0788815474,This movie.... Oh my God. Powerful. Inspiring. Haunting. It bought Margaret Garner's story to a whole new perspective. That she'd rather commit the ultimate sin of murdering one of her children then to let Enslavement snatch their lives. I too have an ancestor that did that. For generations my family was ashamed. But I understand her now. 200 years later. And she's earned my respect.,1431216000,,386,4.953846153846154

There was some much packed into the book(I have often called it the biggest book I've ever read, and not referring to word count ). I didn't belive that you could touch the tip of the iceberg in a couple hours. But it did. Ofcourse, again, there is so much more to experience in the written word, but by way of video adaptions, this movie was on point.

Beloved is supposed to start out as the ghost of a baby, which they portray fine, but then as time goes on Beloved is supposed to grow up. She never does this. The portrayal of Beloved is as a mentally retarded person instead of a growing child. She is awkward, drooling, and sounds downright dumb. And with the powerhouses behind this -- Danny Glover and Oprah, for crying out loud -- you'd think the effects would be a little bit better. The cheesiness of Beloved's red light is god-awful. I can't tell you how much I hated this movie, and I wish we could give negative stars.

77694,5,0788815474,"Although this film was produced in 1998 and is considered a 'flop' it is far from that.  The film brings Toni Morrison's novel ""Beloved"" to life in a cinematic classic.  If it did poorly at the box office, it is mainly because this is a complicated film and story-not the sort of film that you will like if you value explosions, supermodel nudity and banal dialogue.  As most know, Morrison's novel is based upon the historical Margaret Garner who made a difficult decision when she was confronted with a return to slavery.  In the film, much of the plantation life from the novel is edited out focusing on Sethe's post-bellum struggle to find peace within herself.  It is a challenge that is animated by the return of Paul D. Garner and memories of the plantation Sweet Home. Further complications arise with the arrival of the bizarre young woman, Beloved, so seemingly  otherworldly, yet hauntingly familiar.

In this film, strong performances are the norm.  Danny Glover gives a powerful performance as Paul D. Thandie Newton twists her beautiful face into all sorts of hideous grins, and howls like a madwoman.  Oprah is very strong as Sethe, haunted by the demons of her past and present.  Kimberly Elise gives a glowering performance as Denver, the emotionally scarred offspring of Sethe and Halle (who we don't actually see in the film).  In smaller roles, Kessia Embry as Amy Denver and Albert Hall as Stamp Paid light up the screen with big time performances.  But to my thinking, Beah Richards as Baby Suggs, the venerable grandmother Preacher stole the show.  Every second she is on screen the film is given an emotional depth simply from her knowing glances and fluid delivery of her 'sermons' (which are mostly secular messages).

Mention should be made of the fine job of set creation, direction and cinematography.  All told, this film is a fine achievement and a haunting afternoon's entertainment.  It tries to bring together the strands of life for that first generation of African Americans who were freed from their bondage, but not their memories.

77715,3,0788815474,"Some novels are not meant to be adapted into film form.  That isn't to say that they wouldn't make good films, or that we wouldn't want to see them played out, but it merely means that the content is not formatted in an accessible way.  Sometimes, what we can take in through the printed page can come across gaudy, campy and just plain awkward on the big screen.  I fear that that is what befell `Beloved', a film that is ripe with presence, atmosphere and most importantly emotion;  but it is also a film that just doesn't quite work.

In parts, sure; but not as a whole.

`Beloved' tells the graphic and disturbing tale of a former slave named Sethe who has rebuilt her life in Ohio.  She has a quiet presence with her daughter Denver and she has basically secluded herself and her daughter from those around her.  Sethe's past is one of tragedy and turmoil, and because of that past her home is currently haunted; not by evil but by sadness.  When a familiar face shows up on her doorstep, Sethe's past begins to unravel before her.  Paul D. is a man who knows her well, but has been absent from her life for eighteen years and thus isn't privy to the atrocities she's seen.  Just as life begins to settle in for Sethe, Paul D. and Denver another young woman enters their lives.  Beloved, cold, wet and manifesting signs of mental retardation or sheer insanity, begins to stake her mark in their home.  Who is this woman and why is Sethe so drawn to her?

The film's construction makes it rather difficult to truly immerse yourself in the story.  The fragmented storytelling, with flashbacks and dreams, make it hard to stay focused.  I feel that the way the possession or haunting of Sethe's home was also handled rather awkwardly.  The film had moments were it felt more like a cheap horror film than a legitimate dramatic tale.  I also have a slight issue with Thandie Newton's performance.  It is easy to praise her for her physical distortions and committed theatrics, but she also lost control of herself in a few areas and came across almost comical, which took away from the dramatics of the film.  Her final scene was a mess, and her facial contortions were from believably psychotic to campy and laughable.

That said, there are some elements that must be praised.  The cinematography is stellar; the lighting capturing the moody feel of the film flawlessly; and the flashback colorization really elevated those scenes with Beah Richards (who was stellar here).  Oprah and Danny Clover were both very effective in their roles; but it was Kimberly Elise and LisaGay Hamilton who really should receive top mentions with regards to the acting.  Elise in particular was grounded throughout and showed true signs of character development; and Hamilton sold her biggest scene, which would have fallen to pieces had she not conveyed such emotional conviction.  The score and technical merits (like costume design) are all top notch here as well.

I just wish that `Beloved' as a whole felt more organic and cohesive.  Instead, it feels strangely disengaged from itself and unsure of the approach it wants to take.  There is a lot of ground to cover, and Jonathan Demme and his team of screenwriters seem lost in their idea of HOW to make this movie.",1331424000,4,3256,4.684859154929577
77716,4,0788815474,"This movie goes through some of the horrible experiences women dealt with during slavery. During the opening of the movie, we are introduced to Winfrey's character, who apparently has a past. As an escaped slave, she even has to have a child on the run. It appears her home is haunted by a demon, and it is hard to see why. She appears to accept the haunting , but we later find she is haunted because when slave traders come to try and take her back, she tries to kill her children, as she just cannot bear for them to go through what she did. Her remaining daughter lives with her and is terrified of the haunting, and later a comfused young woman shows up, is later appears to be the incarnate of this sadness that haunts the home. Oprahs's character is trying to build a new relationship with Danny Glover's character, but this apparent sadnss that haunts the home drives a wedge between them. This movie explores many of the very harsh realities of what women went through as slaves and how they tried to deal with the injustice and inhumanity, and rise above it during and after gaining their freedom.

77719,5,0788815474,"A beautiful and surprisingly faithful adaptation of the great contemporary American novel by the genius novelist, Toni Morrison.  I didn't think that adapting a nonlinear, interior, and highly evocative novel such as ""Beloved"" was possible to successfully pull off but somehow Jonathan Demme and Oprah Winfrey achieved it.  I was very disappointed that the academy didn't reward their efforts more, but the Academy is largely comprised of older white male voters so perhaps I should not have been surprised.  I also thought that the studio who released it had NO CLUE how to market the film, perhaps for similar reasons.  Too bad as the film really deserves a much wider audience.  Oprah Winfrey's performance proved a revelation.
The subject of the book is the post traumatic stress that slavery inflicted on African Americans (including recent ex-slaves) and on the nation as a whole.  The impact of unprocessed trauma (how it returns again and again to wound the psyche and the community )is embodied in the novel and in the film as a vengeful ghost.

77746,5,0788815474,"I saw this film in the theater its opening weekend, October 1998. Oprah devoted her Friday episode of the opening weekend to the cast of 'Beloved' and was in tears about the release of her 'baby' with this film. 'Beloved' is one of my top three favorite books of all time for its poetic, brutal power in relating the human/spiritual tolls and scars of slavery. I went to this movie hopeful, as a book lover hoping that the source-material hadn't been ruined. No film can ever replace the original mind's eye 'movie' of the book it's based on, but Ms. Winfrey, Mr. Demme and the cast absolutely gave their all to this production. It's a worthy, devastating film; the tragedy of slavery and the human reconstruction, not just societal, from such human cruelty is incomprehensible.

'Beloved' is not an easy film to watch by the sheer realism of the fear, violence and horror of the protagonist's story, Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey and Lisa Gay Hamilton. As with any film dealing with historic atrocity ('Schindler's List,' 'Playing For Time,' 'Roots,') it is impossible to turn away no matter how harsh the onscreen reality is. Perhaps because we know it was worse in reality, it becomes a matter of honoring their struggle by bearing witness to the recreation. In any case, it's a demanding film but the acting work by Danny Glover, Kimberly Elyse, Thandi Newton, Winfrey and Beah Richards will pull you in with both hands.

Over the years I've heard Ms. Winfrey say in interviews how she regrets the failure of this movie at the box-office. I don't find it to be a failure at all. It's an honest, stark mirror of its material, not a popcorn movie, per se. Maybe it would have done better and won Emmys had it been on, say, HBO where the network would have allowed the same depictions as shown in the movie? We'll never know, but I put my money down on it and it's here for people to discover on DVD via purchase, rental or Netflix. I hope Ms. Winfrey will see it's a neglected classic and a brave film with intense performances. I can't praise her enough for this effort. Toni Morrison was pleased with the outcome and you can't do better than please the author of the original Pulitzer-winning material.

77749,5,0788815474,"There were some creepy things about this movie. The haunted house was a home. Sweet Home reminded me of a ""Sweet Home Alabama"" song by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Where the skies are so blue was a line that applied to those who got to have their own way there. My favorite character in the movie ""Beloved"" was like a hippie visionary: Miss Amy Denver of Boston told Sethe:
You have a chokecherry tree on your back.
The religious sequences breathing the air of freedom were quite a contrast to the exploitation for economic reasons that caused so many slaves to run away from Sweet Home. Halle's spirit being broken by seeing the schoolteacher tell how to take Sethe's milk like milking a cow is quite uncanny. I did not see this movie before 2009, and it makes me think how awful the economic schemes that drive many lives have functioned right down to the present day.",1237420800,,857,4.535483870967742

Meanwhile this so-called ghost manages to seduce her mother's ""boyfriend"" who has come back after 18 years.  The ghost manages to get pregnant by him.  Then the ""ghost"", totally naked and pregnant is brought out on the front porch by her mother and disappears in a couple of minutes when a group of church ladies start chanting and singing spiritual songs from the road in front of the house.  Then the mother goes into depression for having lost the child that has come back to her and her other daughter goes to work for rich white folks to support herself and her mother.  That's Beloved in a nutshell.  And let's not forget another ghost that you don't see at all; just her poltergeist activity, except you do see that ghost in the flesh near the end of the movie (and in flashbacks to a prior time).  And people think this is a great movie?  It's a very strange movie and I couldn't tell what the message was supposed to be, if there even was one.  The one redeeming thing about the movie is the period costumes and scenery, which is very beautifully done.  It takes place in the 1800's and you certainly do feel that you have been taken back in time.",1223078400,2,1322,4.333333333333333

Part ghost story, part history, part love story, it weaves a number of diverse elements together in a manner that echoes slave narratives.

One day this movie will get the credit it deserves. Demme and Winfrey took a very difficult book and made a film that works. Some moments are absolutely stunning.

I agree that Rachel Portman's score deserves special praise -- I only wish some musical moments that were in the film were actually included on the CD, like the scene where Sethe visits Beloved's grave after realizing the girl living in the house is her long-lost daughter.

I also wish the scene with Amy Denver had been extended. The Amy in the book is haunting -- the girl in the movie is just sad.

As someone who thinks the book is one of America's greatest novels of all time, I have to say Jonathan Demme and the cast of Beloved created some flawless work. I don't think I will ever understand the negative reviews of this film or the novel for that matter. When I read people say ""disgusting"" or ""gross"" about the film, I get very worried that people don't understand how disgusting and gross American slavery was. This film is about free slaves, people that had the worst cruelties known to man acted out on them. Over 60 million people were destroyed by slavery, and people can't handle this film? This is a film about American's being haunted by the past. It is about American's trying to survive after they were enslaved and then lived in a country that set up a system that would treat them like non citizens. This is a story about motherhood and fear. It is a beautiful film, with some intoxicating images, flawless acting and complex ideas. Maybe read the book,  breath and then watch AND listen to this film.

There is SO much to admire about this film; the acting is first-rate;the Rachel Portman soundtrack is positively one of if not her best;the cinematography  of Fuj Sakimoto is outstanding.........but something still is lost somewhere in the translation of Toni Morrison's novel either in the screenplay or the editing that makes this an extremely difficult movie to follow. There are SO many stories going on in this film that it is hard to know just where to ""hang your hat."" It is a story of slavery, of women's strength, of supernatural/spirituality, of a daughter's needs/jealousy,there are ghosts, there is a certain weirdness that,...well......YIKES!!!....how much more needs to be crammed in to make this film make sense...or more senseless??? Believe me, I admire much about the scope of this film, but it has serious problems that should have been fixed. Perhaps the ""labor of love"" that Oprah and Demme felt for the book only clouded their judgment in the final product. The film is sprawling and loses all center focus. A film and a screenplay need to stand on their own WITHOUT forcing a viewer to read the book OR read other reviews in order to totally understand what they just saw!!! This is where BELOVED fails miserably. What you walk away with is ONLY what you can piece together (or think you can piece together!).

I'm quite confused by so many negative reviews here.  So many people use The Color Purple as a reference point, which is entirely plausable.  In fact, I myself draw parallels between Beloved and The Color Purple, even to Their Eyes Were Watching God.  The overall impression I get from the mixed/negative reviews is that, while The Color Purple is heartwarming, Beloved is weird and cold.  It seems that people forget that The Color Purple deals also with disturbing themes, like incest.  It's just that they come to the forefront of Beloved a whole lot more.  Honestly, what do people want, a reprise of The Color Purple?

If you read between the lines, many reviewers here have been dumbed down by a stream of Hollywood films.  When Thandie Newton stands stark naked and pregnant on the porch in broad daylight, it is NOT a sexy scene.  Shame on those who equate nudity with titillating sex scenes and nothing else.  I could go on and on... peruse the reviews for yourself.

Overall, I was quite satisfied with the film.  Yes, I had questions that weren't answered, such as why Paul D refers to Beloved as ""red heart"" during a pivotal scene.  Still, most of the questions you have will be answered if you pay close attention, and rewind a couple of scenes.

If there is one thing I would have liked more, it would have been more of the backstory of the town of Sweet Home.  You only get a small glimpse and understanding through flashback.  While this makes for good cinema, it does leave your curiosity unsatisfied.  I'm sure many, like myself, will want to read the book to fill in the blanks.",1173916800,4,1792,4.54375

As young Sethe (Lisa Gay Hamilton) is able to make her way to freedom in Ohio she is faced with a horrid choice when one day her ex-master shows up to claim her and her children as his property.  Flashbacks of the past are throughout this film while Sethe (Oprah) is telling her story to Paul D. (Danny Glover).  At the same time these things are happening Sethe and her daughter Denver (Kimberly Elise) are being constantly teased and tormented by a ghost.  Then a mysterious young lady arrives and is known as Beloved.  This homeless girl takes up residence with Sethe and her family and strange things continue to happen.

People trash this movie they say it's not good but you should be the judge.  No matter what you think of it, you will never be able to get the power of the images and especially the power of the ""truth"" out of your mind.

The only problem for black women watching this movie is that they will want to have a heartattack.  It's like when I read Kola Boof's autobiography, the shocking way she poured the truth on about black women's lives was just like this movie.

Like ""Enduring Love"" one of the most gut-wrenching examinations of ""love"" to cross the collective consciousness.

It is no accident that  ""Grave of the Fireflies"" and ""The Tin Drum"" both reveal the queasy aftermath of war on children, because ""Beloved"" shows us the result of our American war on ""the others,"" and how this slavery affected the children in that war and the generations that followed.

The true credit of this masterpiece lies squarely with Jonathan Demme, a master of Magical Realism (witness his ""The Truth About Charlie"" ALSO with Thandie Newton AND Lisa Gay Hamilton!!). He is a transcendent, deeply brilliant director who deserves to be seen as one of the top five directors of the CENTURY (along with James Cameron & Hitchcock, although he outshines these two) and whose inventive use of visual metaphor produces shocking results.

77800,5,0788815474,"Beloved is an excellent movie.

Beloved was adapted from Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name.

Jonathan Demme's strong direction, Tak Fujimoto's stunning photography (especially the yellow tinted flashbacks), the sets, the costumes, the acting, all come together to create a towering achievement in filmmaking.

Oprah is very impressive in the role of Sethe a former slave who is haunted by her violent past. So many scenes are noteworthy. The 28 days of freedom scene, the They took my milk scene, her final scene, and others. Oprah deserves much of the credit for this great movie, as she is the one who fought for ten years to get it made.

Kimberly Elise gives a greatly sympathetic performance as Denver, Sethe's daughter. There is an undercurrent of strength in her character that comes out when she is in the forefront of the movie. Her character is comparable to Celie in The Color Purple, in terms of the ultimate strength of her character.

Thandie Newton is riveting in the title role of Beloved. She gives an intense performance that turned many people off. It is really rare to see an actor give a performance as bold as hers.

Danny Glover gives a fine performance as Paul D. also a former slave who has spent his post slave years wondering around the U.S.

Special attention has to be paid to Beah Richards as Baby Suggs. She gives the type of performance that should be taught in acting classes. The passion and commitment are astounding. The scenes where she is preaching in the clearing are breathtaking and inspirational. She more than deserved a second Oscar nomination. The first being for Guess Who's coming to Dinner.

Rachel Portman's score perfectly compliments the movie. It also stands out by itself as a work of art. She won an Oscar for Emma (1996) and has been nominated several times since, but oddly not for Beloved, which may be her best work.",1126915200,8,1902,4.795107033639144

I should preface my remarks by saying that I'm no fan of Oprah Winfrey, Women's themes, or the Black Experience as the focus of my entertainment. However, this story was heart-rendering and disturbing as the prosaic rituals of daily rural life are shown to be a vulnerable veneer on an underlayer of sadness, horror and regret. I differ with reviewers who hated Tandi Newton's interpretation of the Beloved character--she scared me out of my wits with her facial and verbal expressions and her innocent appearance because you just knew these poor people had a wolf in sheep's clothing under their roof! The trials of the main characters echo the healing process for the rest of the nation in the wake of the incalculable pain and loss of the Civil War and the slave economy which caused it, but it is the haunted eyes of the little family that will remain with you.",1121904000,4,953,4.712574850299402
77813,5,0788815474,"First of all, to all of you naysayers that wrote that it's too ""confusing"", ""boring"", ""violent"", then you never gave the movie a chance.

Slavery, in itself, was nothing but a virtual bloodbath that began hundreds of years ago.  You'd be a fool to try to close your eyes and ears and say, ""Enough of that; it's in the past"".

Sethe, who was fortunate to escape slavery, made a sacrifice that most women today would do for their children.  Tell me folks, if a stranger came to your home to take your children to a life of degregation, pain and suffering, would you hand them over, or put them in a place where they would be safe?  That's what Sethe did.  However, she realized what she lost and longed for her Beloved to come back.  And she did.  Beloved was filled with the anger and the angst that Sethe built within her.  When Beloved came, did you notice how Sethe behaved?  Her anger left her and channeled into Beloved.  But now, this anger had invaded the home and ultimately into everyone else.

Now, Beah Richards (RIP), did an extrordinary job on this movie.  Her portrayal of Baby Suggs couldn't have gone to a more worthy person.  It was as if Beah was leaving her message of life to everyone before she died.  Truly uplifting; better than what I've heard in most churches today.

Yes, there is a lot of symbolism in this movie.  Yes, this movie was made to creep you out a bit.  And YES, you must pay attention to understand what's going on.  I know it didn't go well in the theaters because it was running a close race with mainstream comedies, dramas, and the dreaded ""Blair Witch Project"", so your best bet is to sit at home with your DVD, and if you don't ""get it"" the first time... rewind the darn thing!

Maybe Oprah did make a real big deal about it. When she started screaming, ""I had my baby!!!!"" on the premiere of the movie, that may have cost her some big bucks.  I will say to Oprah, ""humble yourself darling... some people find babies ugly"".

The cast and directors of ""Beloved"" captured the raw essence of this masterpiece.  Toni Morrison should be very honored to have an audience that embraced her work.",1104883200,10,2132,4.438144329896907

I'd have given this just one star, but I just can't do that to Oprah. Hers and everyone else's intentions were good, but this just isn't a great movie.",1103414400,5,411,4.189873417721519
77815,5,0788815474,"I was so disappointed that my copy of ""Beloved"" did not mention winning any film awards.  I think this movie is one of the most underappreciated works of cinema.  It should be deemed a major contribution to women's films and black films.  I cried watching the film just because so much of it stirred my emotions.

Critics have said that viewers could not relate to the Beloved character.  I usually do not care for Thandie Newton.  She's usually just a pretty face in damsel-in-distress roles.  However, she really pushed the envelope with this role.  It took a lot of strength to play a ghostly woman-baby.  It takes tremendous ability to perform the googly-eyed, infantil manners that she makes.  In the theater, I screamed twice, once at her entrance and once toward her exit.  Additionally, I think Beloved the character may have been a metaphor for us African Americans.  She wanted to know about her past.  She wanted to know why she was separated from her family.  She was one of a kind and shrouded in controversy.

Others have said that the movie did not focus enough upon slavery as the book did.  I am quite sure that if more of the horrors of slavery were shown, then people of all races, but especially non-African-Americans, would be scared off and make illogical claims about ""playing the race card.""  This movie does a fantastic job in showing the catch-22 placed upon 19th-century Black American women.  It shows how even working-class communities can punish their own members for not enacting middle-class values.  Further, if the viewer looks carefully the racism of the time is continuously hinted at throughout the film.

Oprah plays well against her persona.  She's the only African-American female billionaire, yet she's playing a poor ex-slave.  She is usually seen in glamourous outfits, yet here she and the other characters wear no makeup.  On her show, she's portrayed as in control of the world.  In this film, her mental state is shattered and even her body can't control itself.  Oprah is not a mother, yet she does a wonderful job in showing a mother's unending love for her daughters.  I love all of Kimberly Elise's films, Set It Off, Bojangles, you name it.  This actress has the Midas touch and this film is one more example of that.

This film, despite the computer graphics, showed the beauty of Midwestern flora and fauna.  The actresses wore rich indigo dress and ornate hairstyles.  This was a strong period piece.  The script is filled with rich dialogue.  ""Your love is too thick, Sethe.""  ""Love is or it isn't.  Thin love ain't no love at all.""  ""She my best thing."" ""No, you're your best thing.""  ""Sometimes I think she was my sister and sometimes I know she was.""

""Beloved"" is becoming one of the most read texts in American English classes.  I think this film will help students understand a rigorous author like Morrison.  However, because this movie only shows a slice of the book, students will still have to do their reading and not just rely on the film.",1102464000,66,3007,4.76504854368932

Like the book, it's bewildering in parts, the dream-like ramblings of Sethe's (played by Oprah Winfrey) slowly unraveling mind. Her mental state is caused by horrific events from her past that are gradually revealed as the story progresses.
Written and acted with the rhythms and cadences of a song or a long poem, Beloved is, at its core, a love story - but along the way the viewer gets flashbacks of mysterious and chilling doses of rage, murder, brutality, abuse and horror from Sethe's former life as a slave.

77866,3,0788815474,"Most movies are made for purely commercial reasons. Others are a labor of love. It's easy enough to dissect the former. Those in the latter category, such as Beloved, are more challenging for a thinking critic, especially when the labor does not produce a very good movie.
Oprah Winfrey, the undisputed Queen of the TV talk shows, co-produced and starred in the film. It is based on the book by the award-winning writer, Toni Morrison. It has a remarkable cast.
Any story revolving around America just before and after The Civil War is probably uncommercial. The period may have seemed glamorous to the general public in Gone With the Wind in 1939, but that remarkable movie was made two decades prior to the Civil Rights Movement. Nowadays, that period of history is one that is painful for either race to dwell on. Slavery was rightfully ended, but equality came much too slowly.
Beloved is the story of Sethe [Winfrey], a former slave who escaped to freedom in Ohio during the war. She is forced to leave behind her family and the man she loves. What she cannot escape are the nightmare memories of her former life. Her new world is soon marred by a tragic event which will haunt her [literally] for the rest of her life.
Sixteen years after she begins her life in Ohio, another ex-slave from the same plantation shows up. He is Paul D. [Danny Glover], who knew her well then, but knows nothing of her life as a free woman. She takes him in, and he tries to bring some joy to the life of her young daughter, Denver [Kimberly Elise]. Their lives are soon thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a girl with no memory of her past. This is Beloved [Thandie Newton], who may or may not be Sethe's other daughter.
Sadly, the picture is marred by several technical flaws. The main problem is with the source material. Some authors write in a manner which is not possible to translate easily to film. Toni Morrison, for example, uses flashbacks, dream sequences and illusions. The movie's writers, as well as director Jonathan Demme, seem lost as to how to handle these important elements. The result disappoints who have read the book and is almost indecipherable to those who have not.
While I admire brevity, a quality I do not possess, I rarely care how long a movie runs, as long as it has something to say. Beloved takes nearly three hours to unfold. A more inspired production could have said it all in two hours or less.
Still, there are moments that shimmer, thanks largely to the artistic cinematography of Tak Fujimoto. Rachel Portman wrote an evocative musical score. Both Kimberley Elise and Thandie Newton are young actresses of immense talent. Both do what they can with their confining roles. Winfrey and Glover have some other great movies to their credit, and we assume they will have more in the future.",1016841600,6,2816,4.656626506024097

I'm also not sure you quite get the relationships between women, which are crucial, in the movie.  You also miss the difficult but genius ""middle passage"" section of the book.  BUT I know, books and movies are different.
This is a ghost story, and just didn't leave me feeling creepy enough.  I don't know what would have been better, but something was missing of the chills down the spine variety.  Still, this is a great movie, and I think Oprah's version of the ""tree"" on Sethe's back is probably worth watching the movie for in itself.

77892,5,0788815474,"Beloved is one of the best films I have ever seen dealing with the controversial and often ignored issue of slavery.  It is ignored because, as many critics have pointed out it is something both white and black people in the United States try very hard to forget.  This probably explains why this film did not do that well on its theatrical release.  In following Toni Morrison's novel very closely the film thoroughly succeeds as a literary adaptaion.  The film has been criticised for being disjointed and incomprehensible however one cannot begin to imagine the suffering of slaves, and the total incomprehensibility of why this horrifying violence and abuse had to be carried on their shoulders.  Slavery at the very least left slaves, even freed ones, psychologically scarred, bewildered, confused and lost from their culture and their families.  One can hardly expect a film attempting to deal with these issues then to be straight forward.  The perfromances are all excellent particularly from Winfrey and Glover but also from Elise and Newton.  Newton in particular is superb at portraying a tormented incarnation of a baby ghost locked inside the body of an eighteen year old, trying to discover, who she is, how she can characterise herself without having known her mother, her family or why she was left behind.  Her struggle is symbolic of all slaves, trying to find their identity as African-Americans in a country which, at that time did not even recognise them as people but as, one of the characters describes Sethe, animals.  My only negative comment about the film is that it wasn't long enough to deal with the issues thoroughly but then no film ever has or can in regards to slavery. That is a minor complaint.

77893,4,0788815474,"This story holds a deeper meaning. It is about something coming back to haunt us all. It is about sins that we commit that never really go away until we can learn to forgive ourselves and those who have offended us. It is about putting the pieces of the mirror of life together and looking deeply into it to see what is really in our souls.

Supernatural evil forces surrounding us can scare us in movies, but what should really frighten us is how we have treated people throughout time. How we have enslaved people in many ways and have treated them as less than human. This story echoes these thoughts.

This is a deeply moving film that must be given your full attention to understand the complexities. I was literally captivated: body, soul and spirit. I was glued to the couch, too scared to go anywhere. ;>

The opening scenes are very violent and shocking. If you didn't read the reviews you would really be wondering if you wanted to keep watching the movie as I did. However, they cleverly showed you only enough to make you terribly curious. What throws a dog against the wall? That is why I was watching to find out what the heck had just happened. It is like a puzzle and you have to pick up a piece here and there. For the mind that analyzes everything...this is a dream movie.

The story does not play out in a sequence of events as some stories do. It slips back into time, dragging out the horrific past and adding bits here and there to make you want to understand the entire story. I thought this was very cleverly done.

The basic story running on the first level is about Sethe's life. She is a slave who escapes from a cruel Kentucky plantation called: ""Sweet Home."" Paul D was also a slave and yet he seems to have more inner strength even though he has seen it all. Sethe is obviously very troubled from her experiences and is determined not to let her children experience the horrors of slavery. She and her family are living on a plot outside of Cincinnati, Ohio eight years after the end of the Civil War.

When slave hunters threaten to take her children back to the plantation, she kills one of her daughters.

She continues to live with her second daughter Denver after her two sons run away. The murdered child then haunts their shack with a red glow until she actually returns in bodily form. Reality and the supernatural are blended together to make this the most creepy movie you will ever see because the creepiness is so subtle it takes you off guard.

Oprah is incredible as an actress. Kimberley Elise (Denver) and Thandie Newton are incredible in their roles. I have never been so freaked out by anyone's facial expressions in my life. The things Thandie Newton can do with her face rival the best. Kimberley's eyes were at times almost ethereal. Danny Glover adds a much needed calm to the movie as he seems to be living in reality most of the time.

Perhaps this movie did not do well because it is more for those who are very patient and caters to a smaller audience with eclectic tastes. This is not really for the mainstream audience. I thought the movie was quite long. Some movies are best viewed at home when they are of this length. The setting in which you view a movie is often very important to your enjoyment.

Rare, vivid, provocative, authentic, intelligent, complex, artistic, scary, emotional, beautiful, sad, delirious, confusing, secretive and overall, great story telling.

77910,1,0788815474,"Before I begin my review of the atrocity that is Oprah Winfrey's Beloved, let me just say that I am a horror movie fan. I've watched many terrible, gory films. However, there has never been a film so hideous that I simply couldn't finish it, no matter how hard I willed myself. That, however, was before I saw THIS.  I honestly have no idea where to begin insulting this film because there are so many things wrong with it. Let it just be said that this is a perfect example of what happens when a self indulgent star, a self indulgent director, a pompous cinematographer, and a clueless screenwriter are given carte blanche to film whatever they chose. The result is a terribly photographed, incoherent, ugly, violent, three hour soup opera with no apparent purpose other to repulse the audience. Worse, the film is painstakingly loyal to Morrison's book. Characters seem to spew bodily fluids at intervals of about ten minutes and these include: puss, blood, urine, drool, feces, vomit, and in a very graphic scene, birth fluid. This would be much easier to stomach if the acting were good, and some of it is. Unfortunately, the few decent performances are underscored by lots of terrible ones. Particularly, the scenes involving Beloved are rendered unintentionally hilarious by her zombie like schtic of drooling, talking as though severly mentally retarded, and screaming hysterically while looking directly into the camera. Another female character who supposedly helps Sethe escape slavery in the first place runs around ranting incoherently about velvet and overemoting like a manic depressive on hard drugs.  As if all this weren't enough, the director and cinematographer seem intent upon overstylizing every single shot. Some shots are colored and executed so conspicuously that one wonders if the actors weren't tempted to stop midway through and say: ""by the way, this shot took a lot of work to create, so you better enjoy it"". The result is blatantly manipulative and borderline unwatchable.  Finally, the music in this film is terrible. Scene after scene is illustrated by the same stereotypical african american ""gospel"" singing which starts out as pretty, becomes intrusive, and then gets annoying. Soon, even this feels contrived, and we are left just wishing scenes would end.  Ultimately, I have one point and only one point to make: DO NOT SEE THIS FILM, DO NOT RENT THIS FILM, DEFINITELY DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDERN SEE IT.

I'm giving the movie version two stars because of the attempt at making this book a film. I know that most movies pale in comparison to their paper inspirations, but this is a book that shouldn't have -- couldn't have -- been made into a quality adaption. Yes, you could make it a good slave/ghost story, but to keep out the beauty of Morrison's language and sentence structuring would be a travesty.  Kudos for Demme to realize this, but by trying to involve the poetry and style of the novel, he's made a mess of a film. And the beautiful and talented Thandie Newton is ... distracting. Her personification of Beloved borders on comical every time she tries to communicate with other characters.  Some things are better left to the reader's mind I guess.

77913,5,0788815474,"This is an important film of Academy Award caliber. The characters are unforgettable and the story, with its haunting surreal quality, will linger long in my mind.  I personally find Toni Morrison difficult and confusing to read.  This was true of the book.  Translated to film, however, the story works, and I found myself intrigued and interested in the tale set in 1873 of former slaves, making a new life for themselves and still living with the horror of the past.
Hooray for Danny Glover.  He is outstanding in the part of Paul D, the former slave who comes courting Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey, who is living with the effects of one horrible act of desperation. Oprah brings her presence to the film and is a good actress.  Alas, though, perhaps it is because she is so very very well known, she was always more Oprah  to me than the character she was playing.  The transitions and flashbacks within the film are seamless, so much so that I didn't realize until the list of credits rolled, that the part of Sethe as a younger woman was played by a different actress, Lisa Gay Hamilton.  She's in the scenes that give the movie its dramatic punch and drive the story and her acting is outstanding.
At almost three hours the video is too long.  Some of the middle could have been honed down.  Sethe's daughter, Denver, played by Kimberly Elise and the strange young woman visitor named Beloved, played by Thandie Newton,  have many scenes together.  The audience guesses, long before the characters do, as to exactly who Beloved is, and there are much too many scenes illustrating the same points.  While played beautifully by the  two young actresses, a few less examples would have served the movie better.
Beloved is the story of some troubled people told against a historical background that has never been really done well in a film before.  It's a somber story, with not a bit of comic relief to relieve the tension that keeps mounting.  It is also a classic tale of sin and punishment and, finally, a sort of redemption.

I've never read  Toni Morrison's celebrated novel, but I could immediately tell from the  first few scenes that the film was rather faithful.  It has detail and  intensity, and a depth that is characteristic of great literature.  From  the first ghost scene with the dog I was immediately enthralled and curious  as to what this story was about and what it was trying to say, and just as  importantly, how it was saying it.  This story works on a deeper level.  Morrison's use of ghosts to reflect internal workings is terribly inventive  and interesting.  The ghosts and stuff, starkly beautiful and strange,  captured through Demme's powerful eye, do not need to be read as real or  not real.  Sure, they have a power of themselves over the viewer, which  Demme does wonderfully.  But, my point is, this is based on a book, and the  ghosts more than anything are metaphors which paint and convey the internal  pain and suffering of the truth.  This film wonderfully shows us that  somethng like slavery and rape can't just be forgotten or healed easily or  quickly.  These horrors, true horrors, persist through time and space, they  are ghosts that move through history.  And the more we suppress them the  more powerful they become.  That in itself, even without respect to  Morrison's impassioned story about the survival of the American African  slave, is in itself, a deep and profound message.  ""Beloved"" is  filled with these sometimes horrible truths, but it never forsakes  humanity, it never levels an accusatory finger.  The brutal truths are also  wonderfully tempered with tender moments.  One of the best in my opinion  being the spiritual gathering of freed slaves, an eloquent vision of the  power of love and community.  If you don't get what I'm saying, you will as  you get further and further into this film.  Movies and books that work on  this level deserve our attention.  And despite what Leonard Maltin writes,  Winfrey's performance is awesome.  This movie simply demands more out of  us.  Give it and you will be rewarded with a great fusion of the ugly and  the beautiful in search of deeper spiritual truths.",965606400,12,2347,4.82994923857868
77918,3,0788815474,"Beloved is a hard film to rate.  It is very well-acted and buitifully directed.  The story is every bit as haunting and interesting as the book and it's obvious that this movie was a labor of love.
Unfortunatly, the  film is far too long.  I know this sounds like a minor complaint but it is  not.  I wouldn't mind it if the film didn't drag as much but the pace is  dreadfully slow.  Also, like the book, the film is very dark and depressing  but it seems to lack the closure that the book had.  As much as the movie  interested me there were many times when I longed for it to be  over.
Beloved is a very well-made movie that suffers from a slow pace.",964656000,,653,4.095238095238095
77919,3,0788815474,"Obviously the making of this film was an endeavor of the heart not only Oprah Winfrey, but for everyone involved. Love for the novel is apparent throughout this intensive drama. However, having read the beautiful novel  by Toni Morrison, I have to say that the movie came short of the impact of  the book.  In the novel, the events building to the climax are subtle, sad,  and even poetic.  Their power is there, but deep and trembling below the  surface.  In the film, however, they are emboldened - a visual and  emotional bombardment. The story itself is a devastating masterpiece.  Those who have never read the novel will very likely love this movie.  It  possesses masterful dramatic performances, cinematography, and musical  scoring. Yet for those who have already read the book, the expectations may  go well beyond even the artistic beauty of this fine film.",963532800,,868,4.903448275862069
77930,5,0788815474,"After seeing this movie in the theatre, I didn't want to leave. I didn't  even want to talk to the friends I had seen it with - I just wanted to stay  in my seat and savor that rare feeling one gets when a movie is so powerful  that it changes something inside you.  And I especially didn't want to hear  the conversation that the couple behind me was having: ""Well, that  was... long"" ""Yeah, someone should find the editor and shoot  him"".  Unfortunately, a lot of people seemed to share these opinions.  Even more unfortunately, I think many people never saw the movie because  they heard comments like those expressed by that couple in the theatre.  And I know by reading a few other reviews here that I was not the only one  moved by this film.  So if you hesitated because of what you heard, give  this movie another chance. As long as you do not need things resolved  within a 2 hour time limit, appreciate films that are not completely  straightforward, and can deal with characters who are not one-dimensional,  I think you will find it rewarding.  If you thought Independence Day was  the pinnacle of filmmaking, well, maybe you should stay away.",962236800,2,1155,4.519417475728155
77931,3,0788815474,"Toni Morrison's novel about a woman's emotional, physical, sexual, and maternal struggles through the slavery of the late 19th century is one that should not be ignored-- it should be read.  I applaud Oprah Winfrey for  bringing this text to film.  Few films, however, live up to the richness of  a literary text-- particulary one as rich as Morrison's.  The film is good;  it is interesting; it has good acting (Danny Glover is wonderful as Paul  D); it is just amazingly difficult to divorce the larger-than-life persona  of OPRAH WINFREY from the character of Sethe.  Had another actress  portrayed Sethe in the film, it might have been an even more powerful  presentation.  Overall the film is good; it just could have been better.",961459200,2,735,4.8861788617886175
77932,5,0788815474,"It may take a decade or two for this film to get the universal accolades it most certainly deserves, but they will come. Demme and Oprah Winfrey have created a spectacle of startling brilliance with this masterwork, a  celluloid dagger that has been burned red-hot, and which will penetrate  through to the astute viewer's very soul. To say that this film is  disturbing is an understatement, and this is, no doubt, why many people  chose to distance themselves from it. Another reason is its brilliant  complexity and sophistication, its kinetic honesty. The spiritual power  invested in this film is enough to give shivers for many reasons. I truly  believe that many people expected Oprah to take Morrison's haunting book  and sanitize it, homogenize it for the screen. She has not done so, and the  realm of cinema is richer for it. This film is a jewel to be savored, a  jewel that has the power to destroy but ultimately redeem. The performances  speak for themselves...from everyone in the cast. That this film was  neglected by the Academy is proof of the emptiness and lack of viewing  skill prevalent even in the industry's powers-that-be. This film haunts  like no other, and I guarantee it will one day be regarded as one of the  classics of 20th Century cinematic history.",957052800,7,1285,4.830275229357798
77933,5,0788815474,"This film deserves so much more credit than it has received. Words cannot describe the intense amounts of emotion and dedication the film-makers had when they did this. This movie has all of the beauty, and power that every  great film displays.  The movie is about a former slave named Seth and the  struggles her family has to endure. The ghost of her slain daughter haunts  the house, and her surviving daughter has become a recluse. She breaks down  crying when she tells her mother that she has no friends because of that  house. Seth is determined to hold her ground. She'll never run from  anything as long as she lives. An old friend from Sweet Home named Paul D  finds Seth after years of walking, they begin a romantic relationship and  everything seems to be going the way things should. The ghost leaves, and  Paul D treats Seth right. Enter Beloved, a young woman they find half dead  next to their house. She speaks as though she has never had the strength to  use her voice. Time passes along and Beloved begins to become attatched to  Seth. As if she was looking for a mother figure in her life. This is a  threat to Paul D who feels he doesn't belong anymore. The rest of the film  unfolds bueatifully and the horrible secrets are uncovered to find the  truth. The acting is so superb and authentic, you feel as though the actors  actully embodied these characters from the page.  The directing is  magnificent. Jonathan Demme lets the story take its time, giving the  characters time to become familiar with the audiance. The plot thickens and  twists so deeply, and the viewer becomes entranced by the tragedy.  The  music is great and the cinematography is jaw-dropping. The movie is so  brilliantly colorful.  Let the movie hypnotize you in its brilliance.  Movies of this magnitude are rare, and very unique. This is the best movie  of the 90's.

77934,5,0788815474,"Watching  ""Beloved"" was such a visceral experience, that I am sure many people won't be able to digest it. But it is their loss, because it is a film of such brilliance, that it stands out as one of the truly  great cinematic achievements of recent memory. The performances are top  notch, starting with one of my favorite actresses Thandie Newton in the  title role. Her performance is one of such raw power, that I was amazed at  it. Nothing she's done previously to this (and she's done some terrific  work) could have prepared me for this. But it is an ensemble piece, and  every single performer is at the top of their game. Kimberly Elise makes a  strong impression as Denver. Her eyes, full of pain and longing, will haunt  me forever. Danny Glover in the role of Paul D its every right note with  his thoughtful deliveries. Ms. Winfrey's most astonishing achievement is  that she lets the audience forget about her television persona. Not only  that, she completely inhabits the role of Sethe, a woman of power,  determination, and ultimately too human. However, my highest praise goes  out to Beah Richards in the role of Baby Suggs. Standing tall atop a tree  trunk, with that beautiful face full of history, every single word she  uttered went right into my heart.

The Toni Morrison novel tells a story that works  very well within the art of literature.  The arch of climax of the book is  not a narrative one but a lyrical and literary one.  Demme and Winfrey  chose to tell the story in the exact same order which Morrison chose but in  a film this sequence is very unfulfilling and seems to just drift and stop.  While the performances were fine (except for Newton's bizarre choices for  Beloved) and the film is superbly shot and scored, this problem could have  only been fixed by not adapting this novel or twisting it into a different  order.

Anyone who has learned English as a  second language in the US in recent years will tell you how helpful closed  captions on TV have been as a learning tool.

By the way, isn't it actually  against the law in Canada not to include the French?

Beloved is a hauntingly beautiful and  moving story that will never leave you.

Beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder.  My eyes beheld Beloved and found it a beauiful well done work of art.
