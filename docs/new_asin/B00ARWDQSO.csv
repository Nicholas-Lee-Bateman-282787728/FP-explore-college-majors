8557066,5,B00ARWDQSO,"Everything about this DVD is beautiful.  This is my favorite performance of a work of art from JSBach that will live as long as our civilization.  I also believe this performance is completely consistent with the intentions of the composer, and the religious significance of this amazing musical creation is a part of the experience.",1490054400,,333,5.036363636363636
8557067,2,B00ARWDQSO,"Ok, I guess it's left to me to be the contrarian here.  I felt like I was watching a typical 'Bach by the stopwatch' kind of approach to this choral masterpiece.  For example, the opening chorus, which is supposed to set the stage of the tragedy and drama to follow, was so speeded up in tempo that you could practically whistle along - it sounded almost cheerful instead of solemn and majestic like it should.  In fact, all throughout the presentation, the music sounded choppy and hurried.  I don't think Bach intended it to sound this way.  When this work is presented in a more thoughtful way, the music naturally flows from chorus to soloists in such an eloquent and moving way that you think it's a separate character in the drama who comments and reflects on what is happening.  And it's hard to give the soloists a fair appraisal under such a badly directed effort, but I didn't see anyone who really stood out.

I've heard many different versions of the St. Matthew Passion over the years, each with its strengths and weaknesses.  The one version that is the closest to my ideal is the one performed by the Stuttgarter Kammerorchester under the direction of Karl Munchinger.  It's one of those magical and historic events that may never be topped.  The musicians, soloists, and chorus in this performance take my breath away.  One standout is the German tenor Fritz Wunderlich.  When he's singing the 'Ich will bei meinem Jesu wachen' aria with chorus, it gives me goosebumps.",1422057600,3,1485,4.713178294573644
8557068,5,B00ARWDQSO,"One of the greatest musical artworks ever created is beautifully performed by John Nelson and his musicians. Everything works in this rendering of the St. Matthew Passion, from the lovely voices of the soloists to every one in the chamber orchestra. Many of Nelson's tempi at first seemed on the fast side; however, in terms of the overall presentation, it created a perfect balance.  Every soloist was truly expressive, with marvelous vocal and instrumental instruments.  The choir was well prepared, singing with fine tone, blend and expression.  The second disc, reveling some behind-the-scenes footage of preparation was engrossing, with great mutual respect and rapport shown between conductor and performers. A fine recording which is truly memorable.",1421971200,,757,5.508620689655173
8557069,5,B00ARWDQSO,"As expected, great.",1420761600,,19,5.666666666666667
8557070,5,B00ARWDQSO,"This is a remarkable performance by an amazing conductor.  The solo voices, choirs, and instrumentalists are all clearly enjoying the performance.  The camera is often on Nelson's face, a rare opportunity for the listener.  Don't miss the opportunity to own this.",1399939200,3,263,5.365853658536586
8557071,5,B00ARWDQSO,"This is a fabulous DVD.  John Nelson does a wonderful job of leading this terrific young choir and brilliant soloists through this remarkable work; one of the pinnacles of Western civilization.  The soloists are superb, the orchestra is wonderful.  I can't say enough about this.  I've performed this work three times, and pretty much have it memorized.  I was enthralled.",1375747200,8,372,5.133333333333334
8557072,5,B00ARWDQSO,"This performance is ravishing from beginning to end. A seemingly effortless journey for John Nelson, a musician and conductor of great distinction. Not so for the soloists for whom singing with such beauty and conviction the roles of such a well known story required voices and ""acting"" ability of a high level.
It is worth playing the second disc, ""The Journey"" first. It gives an intimate account of John Nelson's love of the material and the listener becomes more familiar with each of the soloists and the choir. Such a disc gives such a glimpse of the collegiate effort to create such a performance.
The little band of musicians making up the continuo never intrude. Their artistry and skill add a perfect and very enthusiastic accompaniment to the text and the main actors. Likewise, the choir also never dominate, but only serve to enhance the centrality of the soloists in this performance.
On the debit side one must mention the lack of a libretto. There are subtitles available for much of the performance, but not all. It was good to have on hand an almost full (1961) text from an old but memorable LP set of Klemperer.
This is not a showy effort, but it blends a love of story and of the greatness of the composer himself and of the age and society for which it was written. The venue perhaps could have been made a little more of, so popular it has become since the writings and filming of Ken Follet's book, ""Pillars of the Earth"".
I had wanted the blue ray edition of the performance for the quality of vision and sound one may associate with the medium, but this DVD does not disappoint in any way.
There are many probably excellent performances out there from which to choose and it is staggering to think that there was so little interest in Bach's work until so recently. If one is looking for a very professional intimate performance then this set is worth serious consideration.",1366329600,8,1900,4.640949554896142
8557073,4,B00ARWDQSO,"Bach is the star, but John Nelson could have been his soul mate. His knowledge of the piece was so personal and complete, yet never got in the way,so subtle was his superb direction. I worked with John in NYC in the 60's,Idomeneo etc. He is absolutely first rate, and a wonderful colleague, with which to make music. The quality of the soloists,varied . The Evangelist wore well,but his, and the tenor soloist's open 'AH' vowels  were  distracting(Fritz Wunderlich,why did you have to die so young?!)and bordering at times,on a yell. The vocal transition from E,F,an G is very difficult to do smoothly, but even so....The young chorus and orchestra were clear in their efforts, and much appreciated by this listener. We are all very fortunate,indeed,to have this music, and so wonderfully performed. Thank you Lord. Mallory Walker",1365984000,5,830,5.007246376811594
