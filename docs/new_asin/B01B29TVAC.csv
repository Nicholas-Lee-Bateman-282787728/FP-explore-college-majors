8749091,5,B01B29TVAC,"This is an excellent kids musical, written and directed by the very talented Don Goodner of Young Actors Playhouse. The songs are infectious, and the whole family will probably be singing them for days after watching this.  I've included a copy of what the full jacket looks like, so you can see the information on the back side as well.

If you have kids who are into musical theater, this is a great treat for them to watch!",1454371200,,426,4.448717948717949
