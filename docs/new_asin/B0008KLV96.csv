2259932,5,B0008KLV96,"With so many generic comedies on the air today, Reno 911, along with Arrested Development and Scrubs, show that you don't have to aim for the lowest common denominator and you don't need a laugh track either.

This show is always laugh out loud funny. Both Upsurd and outragious and full of comic talent, there's never a dull moment. Hats off to the writers and the Actors.",1118793600,33,373,4.567164179104478
2259933,5,B0008KLV96,"The season two DVD set is hilarious from the beginning of Disc one through the end of Disc three. Not only has the show gotten funnier and funnier, but the easter eggs and bonus materials are out of hand- cool, random stuff. The ""Drug Arrest Prevention Seminar"" live show is a very different kind of funny, and it's raunchier than anything they've ever shown on Comedy Central. I liked the season one DVD a LOT, I fricking LOVE season two.",1118620800,4,439,4.5
2259934,5,B0008KLV96,"Reno 911! scored with its first season, and its second season won't disappoint.  Once again, the officers of Reno, Nevada are back and they're not only wielding guns, but off-the-wall belly laughs that you'll want to watch over and over.  My favorite officer is Trudy Wigel.  She's the manic-depressant that always considers the negative side to situations.

The DVD - especially the bonus features - are outstanding.  This set is a major improvement of the nearly bare-bones release of the first season.  Quality is impressive, sound is immaculate and there are plenty of bonus features to keep you entertained.

This DVD is one of the best TV-to-DVD releases I've seen.  The satirical look inside the workings of a police station is universally appealing.

Very nice, Comedy Central.",1118448000,8,785,5.118110236220472

2260015,5,B0008KLV96,"The entire second season of Reno 911! is really well done--and sidesplittingly funny! Reno 911! is a hilarious mockumentary-style spoof of a ""Cops"" reality show; the acting is superb and I couldn't stop laughing! They keep the action going in every episode and it all held my attention. They even went through the trouble of filming some of the scenes in a real working police substation in Carson, California! The second season is full of great performances with minimally scripted material; much of this is improvised with actors making up their lines as they go along. The principle actors are Cedric Yarbrough as Deputy Jones who is forever trying to be the ultimate ladies' man; Niecy Nash as Deputy Raineesha Williams, a remarkably curvaceous cop with an attitude; Robert Ben Garant as Deputy Travis Junior who is a quasi-redneck; Thomas Lennon as flamboyantly gay (but sometimes in denial) Lieutenant Jim Dangle; Kerri Kenney as manic depressive, racist Deputy Trudy Wiegel; Carlos Alazraqui as Deputy James Garcia who has his own attitudes and Wendi McLendon-Covey as loose woman Deputy Clementine Johnson. There are even more solid performances by actors doing cameos.

So much happens in this season that I scarcely know where to begin; and I don't want to give away too much so I'll keep this to a relatively brief summary of what you'll see on these three DVDs. First, unlike the first season DVD set, these episodes are not censored which means you hear all the swear words; I think that makes the episodes funnier! Look for incredibly funny scenarios in which Dangle gets promoted and transferred (really?); Jones and Garcia ask a guy dressed up as a milkshake man to sign a petition allowing men on the force to keep their moustaches; Dangle dealing with his former wife; Deputy Williams embracing the Nation of Islam while Jones gets turns on by it--and when we find out the real reason why Williams wanted to be in The Nation of Islam you'll be surprised and amused; Jones and Garcia take a dying man on the ""Dream Come True"" charity service program for a squad car ride; a former criminal turned TV preacher coming to the Reno Sherriff's Department to broadcast his ""Half Hour of Power"" program; Mary Birdsong (who would go on to play Deputy Kimball in season three) as a masseuse in a scene with Deputy Junior; Dangle and Wiegel playing charades in traffic school to pass the time rather than educate the students; the last two episodes setting up a cliffhanger as the force comes under a strict disciplinary evaluation--and so much more! It may seem as if I've given too much away but I assure you that I haven't.

The three DVDs in this set include lots of optional audio commentaries; deleted scenes and footage from the 2004 Comedy Arts festival with the cast onstage. Awesome!

Reno 911: The Complete Second Season is clearly for fans of the show who don't have this already; and fans of the actors here would do well to get this for their collections. In addition, people who appreciate excellent improvised comedy will love this.",1347580800,2,3055,4.837476099426386
2260016,4,B0008KLV96,This show is really funny. It arrived on time and in the condition that was stated. I would recommend it .,1324252800,,106,4.095238095238095
2260017,5,B0008KLV96,"The second season of Reno 911 was an excellent collection of ensemble shows.  The cast were totally carried over from the 1st season.  The same zany situations where the police break the law as often, if not more often, than the perps they arrest.  It is on its face insulting to the police, but just like Gomer Pyle and the Marines, Reno 911 is a favorite of police departments when asked their favorites.

THe second season just developes the characters that we all know now further.  If you loved the 1st season, you should get the 2nd season.  If you are new to Reno 911, it does not matter where you ""start"", 1st season or 2nd season.",1284681600,,639,4.418803418803419

2260022,5,B0008KLV96,"We totally enjoyed Reno911 the second season. The characters are well defined and totally mesh with each other. Although Reno provides the backdrop for the sad law enforcers, the real gems are Lt Dangle and Deputy Trudy Weigle. Great show.",1180396800,,239,5.0
2260023,5,B0008KLV96,"Reno 911 is by far one of Americas funniest parody TV shows. I enjoyed Season 2 and episode 2 ""Wiegel's New Boyfriend"" is one of the best episodes yet. The episode revolves around Deputy Trudy Wiegel having a new boyfriend who isn't all there but neither is she... The others soon realize he's The ""Truckee River Killer"" and attempt to do some ""recon"" work when invited to his house for dinner. Lt. Jim Dangle once again makes this season extra good with his short shorts and flamboyant personality.

I was extremely happy with Amazon's service. You can not purchase Reno anywhere in Australia so Amazon was the first place I looked and I will defiantly be a returning customer :)

2260024,5,B0008KLV96,I really love this show.  It is so funny.  Beware of language - not for children or those offended by crude talk.  It's comedy you don't really have to think about.,1168300800,2,164,4.225806451612903
2260032,5,B0008KLV96,"First, we need a little truth-in-advertising here: these DVDs are NOT uncensored.  ""Mostly uncensored"" would be more like it.  In fact, there is one scene where the racial ""n"" word is visually censored while at the same time its verbal use is not.  While this can be explained away as a limitation of the production process, it's just odd and makes you wonder if the scene wouldn't have worked better if it had been censored altogether.  Additionally, some of the first episodes in this season almost seemed to be written or improvised around the fact that the cast knew that their speech was NOT going to be censored, so they set about throwing expletives around in a dizzying display of adolescent-like freedom.  The use of the profanity is not offensive in itself, but the sophomoric atmosphere it creates is way below the talents of these gifted comic actors.

Taken as a whole, this second season downplays its parody of COPS which the writers successfully delivered to us in season one.  It's still there, to be sure, but here we find ourselves more entrenched in the familiar arena of sketch comedy.  It takes the ball awhile to get truly rolling, and at first I was beginning to feel disappointed to think that I was going to BE disappointed by the time I got to the season's end.

But, fear not, because especially thanks to the efforts of the bad-guy minor characters, Lieutenant Dangle and crew definitely leave us laughing.  The season ending double-episode works just as well as any other sitcom-classic's season end, and in it we are treated to cameo appearances by Martin Mull, Wayne Brady and some of the missing minor characters from season one as we witness a comedic display of The Who's ""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.""

All in all, just as in season one, these are people who are just fun to be with.  These season two disks are highly recommended to all students of comedy, as well as to others who just need a good laugh.  Niecy Nash's charm and Thomas Lennon's gum-chewing, dead-pan delivery are worth the price of admission all by themselves.  And if you ever have to go to ""traffic school"" because you've received a traffic ticket, I'll bet you ""stick time"" that you'll never be in a class like the ones administered by the deputies in Reno911.

As in season one, there is no laugh track, and bonus material and commentary are thrown in as well.",1163462400,,2381,4.649164677804296
2260033,3,B0008KLV96,"I was disappointed with this season in comparison with the first; it lacked the same wit and energy. In particular, many of the skits seemed short and choppy, as if they couldn't maintain momentum with an idea as well as they did the first time. Perhaps the difference was in the editting and not the performance? I bought the first season but not the second, especially given the much higher price.

AND after seeing the remaining seasons, the 1st season was the best. This show lost it's mojo. It's like a leaky balloon. . .each season was worse than the one before. On the positive side, NO season was worse than the movie; the movie suk'd.",1163289600,,643,4.543103448275862

2260037,5,B0008KLV96,"Again, the Reno Sheriff's Department ravages the town with its ineptitude and craziness.  This volume culminates with the DA investigating the team's questionable actions while enforcing the law.  Notable guests are Mindy Sterling of Austin Powers fame and Dave Holmes who started out as an MTV VJ and now appears (or has appeared) as a host on practically every cable program imaginable.  Celebrity guest Kenny Rogers gets in a few digs when the deputies assigned to patrol his book signing really muck things up.  This series has not lost anything from the first season to this one.  And all the characters remain consistent and fun, given that this show is mostly improvised.  Can't wait for Season 3.  And keep up the great work, guys!  You are Reno's finest!!!",1148342400,,765,4.921875

2260039,5,B0008KLV96,"Bizarre behavior in a police department? and we always thought Cops didn't have a sense of humor ... This show is, from beginning to end, packed with excellent writing and even better ad-libbing. Non-stop nonsense!

The cast blew me away--all virtal unknowns before this show, and yet so talented!  It takes a natural brilliance to play ""dumb"" so well.

Some of the can't-miss recurring issues in Season 2 include:

~ Trudy falling in love with a serial killer

~ A gay prisoner/leader of the gang the ""Grape Slushies""

~ Dangle's wife (gasp! it's true)

~ Some amazing PSAs by R. Williams

~ Hospital visits that make you feel sorry for everyone involved

~ Hilarious segments from traffic school

~ The entire gang finally must pay the price for their actions

Perks to owning the DVD set:

~ excellent deleted scenes

~ a special segment from the 2004 Comedy Arts festival (whole cast onstage)

~ no bleeps--you get to hear what they really say

~ Come on, you'll have Reno 911 anytime of day!",1134518400,12,996,4.676300578034682
2260040,5,B0008KLV96,"Few shows can build upon themselves to create an even better second season. Reno 911! does just that. Each episode is simply hilarious and surprises you in some way. From Jones and Garcia beating up the milk shake man to Dangle's constant fight to keep his testicles from coming out of his very short shorts, it's all hilarious. Women, in a lot of cases, take the back seat in comedies. In Reno 911! however, they call 'Shotgun' and deliver. Whether it's Clemmy's sexuality, Rayneesha's ever changing obsessions, or Wiegel's complete disregard of common sense, they take as much spotlight as the guys do. My favorite character, Junior, is even funnier this time around. Be it his selling of Dangle's bike, his run-in with the massage lady, or when he's testing the department's new kevlar vests, it's all funny. Seeing every episode uncensored makes this season's release even better than last season's. The Druge Arrest Prevention Seminar from HBO's 2004 Comedy Arts Festival was just as good as any episode is. The sound quality is pretty bad but it's worth turning up because seeing Wiegel cussing the participant out is worth it alone. The deleted/extended scenes really should've been left in because they're just as funny as what was left in. And the fact that the scenes are so long is a real treat as well.

It amazes me that week after week they keep things fresh and funny. The cast comes back better than ever and doesn't let one certain member shine brighter than the other. This season patches the hole from season one to season two very well and leaves you with quite the cliffhanger. With a slew of great guest appearances (Kenny Rogers' appearance will no doubt go down as one of the highlights of Reno 911!) and wonderful dialogue (particularly Dangle and Junior's banter while waiting for the Presidential motorcade), I wouldn't understand why anyone wouldn't love this show. I for one look forward to future outings with the deputies of Reno, and can't wait to see season three hit the shelves.",1133568000,11,2013,4.834782608695652

2260050,5,B0008KLV96,"The second season of Reno 911! is well worth watching.  The running gags in Season 2 are the 'Bullet Proof Vest' tests, and, like in Season 1, Dangle's bike.

Don't miss this one!",1130112000,2,179,4.393939393939394
2260051,5,B0008KLV96,"Season 2 of Reno 911 is, by far, one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Not only are the characters exceedingly well drawn and the plot lines uncontrived, the dialogue comes off snappier and funnier than ever. The unstable Trudy Wiegel steals every scene she's in, and Lt. Jim Dangle once again has hundreds of droll, mid-West delivered lines that had me in hysterics. The secret of the show's success is its varied group of mismatched characters and the interactions therein. There's an endless amount of material in mixing and matching the various members of the force together. Throw in some beautifully realised supporting characters - such as Terry, the high-camp, Rollerskate-wearing trustee; or Weigel's serial-killer boyfriend - and you've got one of the most involving comedies in years. That the dialogue is completely improvised only adds to the freshness and pace of the show.

The best thing is that Reno 911 isn't afraid to go 'dark' in its sense of humour. Sparing us from sanitised language, adult themes or sexuality is one of its greatest assets. This season is uncensored as well, which works in the show's favour. Removing the 'bleeps' of the first series allows the dialogue to hit you with its full effect.

I would advise anyone that's a fan of good black comedy to get this series. It's a masterwork.",1129161600,4,1328,4.897777777777778
2260052,5,B0008KLV96,"I enjoyed this a great deal. I resisted a temptation by writing this. I love this. Lennon is a funny man.. Mc Covney, Kenney, ""Junior"", and Garcia..Love to all ya guys you make me laugh real hard..Wendy's the whore, the black chick makes like a bandit acting all tough, Lennon's the perfect gay guy in all of his movies. There's nothing like this. Nothing, at all compares. I stay on the edge of my seat, and stay up just to watch. I love this..Vanes.",1128988800,,451,4.380952380952381
2260053,3,B0008KLV96,"I'm really surprised to see so many glowing reviews here. I loved Season 1, but thought Season 2 jumped the shark. The first epsiode was fine, particularly the night out at the end. I think they focused too much on stories rather than scenes.

For example: The episode with Constable Smiley was basically one joke--the innocent-seeming British cop brutalizing Reno. The first scene with him worked because of the surprise, but from there the joke was dead.",1128470400,3,456,4.922077922077922
2260054,5,B0008KLV96,"Because I don't have cable /satellite, I was VERY anxious to get a RENO 911 fix after laughing myself silly after Season 1.  I was not disappointed in the least.  If you liked the first season, you'll like this batch of shows as well.  Wow, what a great review I just gave!!!

This kind of show is really hard to review, in my opinion.  Humor is tough enough to explain...and more than most things on TV, you either like and get RENO 911, or you will find it loud, crude, obnoxious, and you'll spend a lot of time scratching your head over what people enjoyed so darn much.  The closest I can come to describing it is a mixture of COPS, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, and a really dirty joke.  It has the ""shaky-camera, documentary-style"" of COPS, with the brilliant improvisational work of GUFFMAN, CURB, SPINAL TAP, and so forth, plus lots of filthy stuff.

The characters have gotten richer this year.  The ostensible ""leader,"" Dangle, who was the funniest character in Season 1, is just more out there than ever.  He bounces back and forth from being out of the closet to back in, as the mood strikes.  He's a uniquely deluded person...totally unaware of what a screw-up he is.  Officer Garcia and Junior get to take center stage a little more often, and Junior in particular is really coming to life.  We learn a lot about his ""domestic"" situation, and there are some classic scenes revolving around his unexpected ""marriage.""

Wiegel is my favorite among the women, and she's more unhinged than ever.  Dating a serial killer who's in prison!  One truly classic episode has her and Garcia serving as bodyguards for Kenny Rogers.  Not only are they funny, but darned if Rogers doesn't keep right up with them, even in the foul language department.

If you find the shows humor and tone amusing, then these are so great, because they NEVER let up.  If one bit falls a little flat...don't worry, you've only wasted 30 seconds, because they go right on to something else that's sure to be up your alley.  I'm sure with all the improvising they do, there's lots and lots of stuff on the cutting room floor (we see some of that with the bonus materials), but what they edit their shows down to is 21 minutes of non-stop hilarity.  Some comedies are only really good if you're already in a good mood.  RENO 911 is loud and crazy enough to pull me out of a funk and leave me laughing.  You don't smile at this show...you laugh out loud!  (Just see the scene where Dangle and Weigel try to clean books that have been donated for charity and later foully vandalized.  That will either turn you off the show forever, or have you red in the face with glee!)

My only complaint...I think I liked the ""censored"" version of Season 1 better.  All the really bad cusswords are ""bleeped.""  Somehow, the huge amount of bleeps are funny in and of themselves, rather than just hearing the obvious crudities.  I would suggest in future seasons the option to switch ""languages"" to beeped and unbeeped.  This is minor, and just a personal preference, I'm sure.

ENJOY!!",1126656000,2,3062,4.583793738489871
2260055,1,B0008KLV96,I reviewed Season One - (Disappointed) and still have not opened Season Two.,1126051200,,76,4.923076923076923
2260056,5,B0008KLV96,"I do not have television in my house.  I had seen a couple of episodes of Reno 991 and thought they were funny but getting to see the whole season via my laptop while laying in bed was great.  There were times I laughed so hard that tears welled up in my eyes and since I was lying on my back I could not see the screen.  I had to pause the video until I could wipe the tears from my eyes.

The humor is ribald, to say the least, but outrageously funny.",1125446400,,453,3.838709677419355
2260057,5,B0008KLV96,"In the second season's first episode, Lt. Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon) mistakenly thinks he's been promoted.  However, instead of leaving to work in Carson City, he still leads the Reno Sheriff's Department. Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenney) manages to get a boyfriend, who turns out to be a serial killer.  Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey), the blonde bombshell who always gets her man, has a torrid love affair with Deputy James Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui).  Deputy Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash) briefly joins the Nation of Islam, which arouses the interest of Deputy S. Jones (Cedric Yarbrough).  Deputy Travis Junior (Robert Ben Garant), going undercover in a sex slave sting, accidentally marries a Chinese prostitute!

British Detective Smiley visits the Reno Sheriff's Department, and ends up being shot dead after a bank robbery he pulled!  Wiegel and Garcia are assigned to protect Kenny Rogers at a book signing in the local mall.  They take down all of the flyers advertising his appearance and, as a result, only one person shows up.  Unfortunately, that person is an obsessed fan who shoots Kenny!  Jones and Garcia playfully attack a man wearing a milkshake costume.  Disoriented, the milkshake man walks to the middle of a highway and is run over by a truck.  This leads to an investigation by the District Attorney, in which each member of the Sheriff's Department turns against everybody else.  At the conclusion of the investigation, they're all fired.  To find out what happened to them, you'll have to watch season three of ""Reno 911!"" on Comedy Central.

Unlike the DVD boxed set for season one, the episodes in season two include all of the profanity.  In addition, there are also over 90 minutes of alternate and deleted scenes.  It's a nice bonus feature, even though some of the scenes last too long.  A terrific bonus feature is a live performance of the group, taped at a 2004 comedy festival in Aspen, Colorado.  Highlights include a blindfolded Lt. Jim Dangle frisking an audience member for drugs, Travis Junior and Wiegel's graphic demonstration on how to pass a drug-related urine test, and Jones leading the cast in a performance of the song ""Hip Hop Cop.""",1123891200,10,2204,5.024793388429752

Every word spoken, plotline, situation, facial expression, characterization is so totally ""perfect"" I cannot help but burst out laughing - constantly while watching this group of superb actors.

I just wanted to point out that you can watch a 10-15 minute clip of Junior and Dangle trying to make an advertisement for the first season of Reno 911! Here's how you do it:

- Pop in Disc 1 of Season 2

- Highlight ""Episode 4""

- Press ""down"" and then first bar of the radio will be highlighted. Select it.

2260062,5,B0008KLV96,"In it's sophmore season, Comedy Central's Reno 911 achieved near perfection.  The hapless cops of the Reno Sheriff's Department get into all sorts of hijinks here, consistently upping the ante from everything done in the show's first season.  Beginning with Officer Weigel (Kerri Kinney-Silver) becoming rather kinkily involved with a man who may be a serial killer, to the cop's annual Policeman's Ball being upstaged by the Reno Fire Department's annual Pancake Dinner (including a hysterical visit to some sick children in a hospital) to the surprising season ending cliffhanger which finds Lieutenant Dangle (Thomas Lennon) and co. losing their jobs as ""Milkshake Man"" gets run over by a semi-truck after taking a beating from Officers Jones and Garcia (also reffered to here by a suspect as ""Power Man and Iron Fist"", heh-heh).  What's even more surprising about the second season of Reno 911 is that it doesn't succumb to the staleness that the first season almost suffered from.  The jokes and gags are fast and funny, and this DVD set is almost entirely uncensored (except for the nudity, which isn't such a drawback).  The hilarious season finale, featuring B-list stars such as Martin Mull, Sean Young, Lou ""Incredible Hulk"" Ferrigno, and Lorenzo Lamas among others as the officer's replacements, is worth the price of admission alone, and by the end of it, you'll be begging for season three.  All in all, this incredibly hilarious second season of Reno 911 solidifies the show as another Comedy Central gem like South Park and Chapelle's Show before it, and if you've never checked it out, make like the show's executive producer Danny DeVito and see what you've been missing.",1121040000,4,1688,5.075812274368231

2260065,5,B0008KLV96,"Wow..talk about hilarity.  Although some stuff has been lackin since the first season, such as the Police Car cams segments showing officers pulling over people, good 'ole Terry, and Trudy's more hilarious racist side busting out (although it's still in there...score), this season has definitely allowed for some huge laughs.  Despite the Halloween Episode on season 1 being the best, almost all the ones on season 2 have made it a superior boxset over season 1 (should still buy season 1 though).

Want to know why?  Because of almost all the episodes (especially Nation of Islam, Mr. Smiley, Garcia and Johnson hookup, and the hilarious reverend episodes), not to mention the bonus features.

Definitely not for kids...unless you're really lenient and/or sadistic parents.  Besides the frequent appearances of the F-bomb, a lot of the content is not that suitable for the young ones.  Also, this show is definitely not for everyone.  Spinal Tap-ish humor where generally serious moments are basically parodied with subtle, witty, and sometimes violent dialogue/actions. If you can't appreciate them, don't blame it on the show.

So Remember on keepin' it real.  real safe.  And buy the DVDs.",1119484800,3,1194,5.198952879581152

2260067,4,B0008KLV96,"First I have to say I love this show.  I bought the DVD the first day it came out and have watched about 6 episodes even though I think I've seen all of them from this season.  Two things that would have made the DVD perfect: Put the bleeps back in!  I curse like a sailor myself so it has nothing to do w/ being offended, but the premise is it's a real show and they wouldn't have cursing on a real TV show.  The bleeps make it funnier because you know what they're saying anyway and it just works better i think.  And the second thing: 4:3?!  C'mon guys... you knew after season 1 you had a hit on your hands.  Can you buy or rent some HD cameras so we can have 1:85 or 1:78?!  You had to know it would be coming out on DVD even if you're not going to broadcast it widescreen.  OK, so if you're a real techie you're thinking if it was some guy following the police they wouldn't be lugging around an HD camera, right?  Well doesn't have to be HD cause Fox broadcasts Cops widescreen but not HD so that'll work for me.  So we're into season 3, you better be using better cameras!",1119225600,3,1080,4.023474178403756
