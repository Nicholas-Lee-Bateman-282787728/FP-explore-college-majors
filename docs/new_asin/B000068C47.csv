1725113,4,B000068C47,"Filmed for British cable in the early 90's, this was one in a series of four movies based on the romantic period novels of Dame Barbara Cartland.  A HAZARD OF HEARTS is the tale of innocent-yet headstrong Serena Staverley (Helena Bonham-Carter), whose hand in marriage is gambled away by her father in lieu of a debt to disgusting lecher Lord Wrotham (Edward Fox).  Serena is saved by Lord Justin Vulcan (Marcus Gilbert) only to fall prey to his cruel mother Lady Harriet (Diana Rigg), the sword-wielding leader of a group of smugglers.  There is a lot of enjoyable mystery, intrigue and romance in this exceptional Barbara Cartland adaptation.  Also featuring Christopher Plummer, Fiona Fullerton, Eileen Atkins, Anna Massey, Gareth Hunt and Neil Dickson.",1149984000,6,756,5.121951219512195

7964193,1,B000068C47,"Unbelievably horrid. If Barbara Cartland's pink fantasyland is what you like then this is for you. As Miss Jean Brodie said, for those that like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing that they like. No accounting for taste.",1444953600,,231,4.523809523809524

7964196,5,B000068C47,"I watched ""A Hazard of Heart"" when I was studied in Australia.  In fact, I never like Babara Cartland because the story was too romantic and predictable.

When I watch the movie, I hooked.  I remembered that I went to bought the VHS and the book because I loved the movie.  Diana Rigg and Christopher Plummer were great. But what surprised me most were Helena Bonham Carter and Marcus Gilbert.  I never heard about them before (I mean around 20 years ago) but their performance just incredibly real (eventhough I thought that Helena look like cranky little girl all the time then but when she smiled, it was so fresh, sweet and bright), the sets, the costumes, locations and the casts really ... really great.

Let say that I owned ""A Hazard of Hearts"" VHS and then lend it to someone who never returned it to me.  Then my brother went to UK and got the new one for me.  Then, my video player broken. I cannot play the movie since no one want to fix the machine.  Now, I ordered the DVD which in fact I just want one movie but I have to buy both ""A Hazard of Hearts/Lady Hamilton""  Anyway, I told myself that I have to have it.",1241740800,5,1127,4.273584905660377
7964197,5,B000068C47,"After viewing this movie for the first time I could not understand why I had not heard of it before.  The acting was extremely good.  The leading man and leading lady were extremely good looking.  Where are they now?  The plot was interesting as well as exciting.  Boy!  that Marcus Gilbert, talk about a leading man for Romantic movies.  I think the actors in Pride and Prejudice viewed this old movie to take notes for their movie.  Beautiful story, Beautiful delivery.",1156204800,13,471,4.728395061728395
