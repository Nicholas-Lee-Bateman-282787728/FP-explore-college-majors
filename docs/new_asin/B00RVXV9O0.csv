8696000,1,B00RVXV9O0,"The classic battle of the gods moves to southern California, because given a choice of anywhere in the universe...Loki (Mike Milian) comes to San Diego with the ability to turn people into mindless followers with dilated pupil contacts/ Loki could speak English in Valhalla or wherever, but can only do the demonic voice enhancer thing on earth.  Thor ((Max Aria) arrives later and manages to combat legions of armed followers armed with a blonde (Jacqui Holland), a faulty memory, a set of abs, and a diploma from the Arnold Schwarzenegger school of acting. They don't stand a chance.

No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1466208000,,785,4.887218045112782
