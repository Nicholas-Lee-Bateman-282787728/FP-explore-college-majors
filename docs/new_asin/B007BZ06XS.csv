8514134,4,B007BZ06XS,"I bought it for Horst Buccholtz. I have liked him ever since he made ""FANNY."" A very talented and handsome man. But, this is from Germany without English subtitles. If you speak German or can read German subtitles, you will enjoy it. I contacted the seller and although it says no returns. He gave me his address to return it. I asked for a version dubbed or Subtitled in English. I watched the whole movie and the ending was very sad. It is well worth getting, if there is an English subtitled or dubbed version. I have bought a few DVDs from Germany and they all had English subtitles. Also I bought DVDs from Spain, titles not released here in the States. How about CRIME IN THE STREETS with Sal Mineo and Cassavettes. Yes, from Spain in English and Spanish subtitles. Horst was very young in the movie.",1412640000,,806,4.452702702702703
