8198260,1,B000R17RNK,"I was thrilled when I bought this video because it contained 57 short films by one of the early masters. I couldn't have been more let down. It is obvious that the makers of this DVD had no interest in their subject other than to make money off of him. The most annoying and consistent element in this selection of videos is how they formatted the videos to fit the TV screen: In the same way that widescreen converted to full screen cuts off the sides of the film, these films were carelessly squeezed into a format that frequently cut off the top (People's HEADS) or bottom of the screen. Whole segments are run where you don't see above a person's mouth. It is infuriating.",1191974400,21,676,4.416
