8138972,5,B000HDRAW6,Very informative historical dvd. Great for real British history buffs. Perhaps some people will find it like a history class style dvd.,1364256000,,135,5.181818181818182
8138973,3,B000HDRAW6,"I tried to showing this to my AP European History students, but the audio was just to difficult to understand.  Loud background music and thick British accents made it nearly impossible to understand what the narrator was saying.  At one point, one of my students asked if we could turn on the captions just so she could understand what was being said!  The production was just not very well done.",1301184000,,397,4.642857142857143
8138974,2,B000HDRAW6,"This film succeeds as a basic review of the Victorian Age, however the majority of experts interviewed are incredibly boring making it hard to concentrate on the content.",1201219200,4,170,5.107142857142857
8138975,3,B000HDRAW6,This DVD is okay if you just want to learn the basics  of Victorian history. It does not compare to any DVD produced by the History Channel for display or imformational purposes. I was disappointed in the DVD.,1174694400,4,209,4.5
