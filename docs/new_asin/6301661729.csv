345063,5,6301661729,"Unbelievable breakthrough sci-fi movie from 1968.  Flawless conception from Twilight Zone writer and guide Rod Sirling.  I remember watching this for the first time when I was about 11 and I was just floored.  Still a great ride 17 years later and an essential item for any sci-fi movie fan.  Great use of sci-fi in exploring cultural and philisophical issues of great proportions and magnitude.  Good effects for 1968, no CGI or advanced makeup and the makeup and sets don't look dated.  Great story, characters, action, and a mind-shattering ending, though the stupid DVD cover gives it away!  I know any adult probably knows the ending, but why blow it for younger viewers?  Charleton Heston in his prime with Linda Harrison as a devoted, mute supermodel love slave.  No time for love scenes with this tight, well-constructed sci-fi action drama.

345064,5,6301661729,"""Planet of the Apes"" was a watershed film in the sci-fi genre; before this movie, sci-fi was all about Martians, two-headed space invaders, and monsters caused by nuclear fallout.  Charlton Heston is not one of my favorite actors; he's too heavy-handed as a rule, but he was never better than in the role of Taylor, the astronaut who is returning home from space with two crew members (a third dies en route) and finds that they have landed on what looks like a totally alien planet.  The few humans they run into look as though they have reverted back to a stone-age existence, but what really blows him away is when he finds that the apes have taken over the planet and have placed the humans in servitude.  How does it feel to be treated like an animal for a change?  The ape society is riven with dissensions as the more liberal-minded simians and the soldier apes clash over how their captives are to be treated; and Taylor eventually escapes... but to what?  The mind-blowing scene where Taylor discovers the rust-eaten remains of the Statue of Liberty and realizes he's been home all along is one of the classics in film-making; it's pure Rod Serling, right out of the twilight zone, and it still wows us after all these decades.  The POTA spinoffs went downhill from the first film; the sequels were uniformly awful, but the original is still the champ.",1025654400,2,1361,4.626556016597511
345065,5,6301661729,"What can be said about 1968. It was a turbulent year for many. The United States was torn apart due to the youth protests over the Vietnam War. The assassinations of both Dr. Martin Luthur King, Jr. and Presidential Candidate Robert Kennedy. The violence of the National Democratic Convention in Chicago, Illinois. The Apollo 8 moon mission. The release of two MGM classic films, 2001:A Space Odyssey and Ice Station Zebra. Science and Technology progressing furthur than political and social knowledge. It was a wonder, if not a miracle, that we got out of the '60's alive. It was around the summer of 1968 that a classic science fiction film would address the civil unrest that the world was going through. Not just here, but everywhere on the Earth. The name of this masterpiece from 20th Century Fox was none other than....Planet Of The Apes.
Set at first in 1973, the film begins with four astronauts. Three men and one woman. One of the men, Colonel Taylor, has gotten so sick and distressed with the state of humanity, that he virtually exiles himself from the human race, by going on the deep space mission for NASA. The film flash forwards to a stunning scene where the space probe crashes in the lake of a rocky, hilly, semi-arid planet with sparse forestation. When the female astronaut is killed in the crash, Taylor and the two young men escape when the ship starts to sink. At first the three survivors think that they are on another planet orbiting the star Bellatrix, in the constellation of Orion. During the course of the film, Taylor and his friends come upon a race of humans who are mute, and have the appearance of prehistoric man and woman. During that encounter, Taylor's two friends are killed when an army of Apes appear. Being rounded up with the rest of the mute humans, Taylor is held prisoner at first. It is only when he befriends two kind chimpanzee scientists and another young ape, that Taylor reveals how intelligent he is to his captors. That revelation not only surprises the ape population, but also sneds them into a state of panic. Knowing that Taylor will soon be disposed of, the two chimpanzees, Cornelius and Zira, along with Zira's nephew Lucius, help Taylor and a female mute human named Nova, escape from their imprisonment. There, they flee into a desert area called the Forbidden Zone, where they find the remnants of the human race, and a shocking answer that not only takes Taylor by surprise, but everyone else who has watched the movie.
What can be said about Planet Of The Apes. Charlton Heston summed it up best. ""It was the first of the space operas."" Not only that, it has gone on to become a futuristic, post apocalyptic, science fiction adventure. A film that not entertains, but also addresses many key issues about our society and the problems that the human race still suffers from to this day. Charlton Heston does a remarkable performance as Taylor, a man so much of a cynical and sarcastic misanthrope who is ironically thrusted into the role of man's savior. The late British actors Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans also bring out remarkable perormances as Cornelius and the human-hating and fearing Dr. Zaius. Even Kim Hunter and Linda Harrison give remarkable performances as Zira and Nova. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is powerful, if not beautiful. And the script written by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson, is also solid and thought-provoking. Right until the shocking conclusion where we learn about where Taylor was all along.
If you enjoy science fiction, you will enjoy Planet Of The Apes. The 1968 version is alot better than Tim Burton's re-imagining. Most of all, you will be astounded and totally surprised by this wonderful and cerebral masterpiece of the genre.",1016582400,4,3746,4.818322981366459
345066,5,6301661729,"I've seen the original Planet of the Apes about three times, and still rate it the number 1 apes film. Michael Wilson and Rod Serling's screenplay is intelligent, and Franklin Schaffner is a wonderful director. Starring Charlton Heston and Kim Hunter (She was more important in this one than Roddy Mcdowall) this film still sends social messages and is wildly entertaining.
The story begins with Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston), the leader of a band of astronauts, falling asleep. A year later, the spacecraft crashes in the water of an unfamiliar planet. He and his crew (except Stuart, the lovely female astronaut) escape and go to shore. Taylor, after checking the clocks, knows that in his time, his crew and him were away from Earth for 18 months. But 2,000 years passed on Earth. The astronauts move across the desert, and discover a watering hole in the forest. They also encounter primitive humans. While eating, the humans and astronauts are hunted by intelligent gorillas. They kill one astronaut. Taylor is shot and taken captive. He meets a sympathetic chimpanzee named Zira (Kim Hunter) and her husband Cornelius (Roddy Mcdowall). Taylor, a human who once had believed that man was not worth studying anymore, finds himself defending human kind, mating with a girl named Nova (Linda Harrison) and hunted by the orangutan leader Dr. Zauis (Marice Evans). The film's true stars are: Charlton Heston, Marice Evans, Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall, and Linda Harrison. Produced by Arthur P. Jacobs, the film was beautiful. John Chambers created fairly good makeup (The Oranutans look the most realistic, even though the male orangs look like female orangs), and the film remains a classic.",1015891200,,1701,5.122302158273381

345068,5,6301661729,"PLANET is an amazing movie in every possible way. The story is captivating, the images breath taking, and the moral important. Not to mention a climax that will send chills up and down your body.  Only problem....Charlton Heston has to be the worst actor in movie history.",1009497600,,272,4.787234042553192
345069,5,6301661729,"Without a doubt,Planet of the Apes is the best movie in the history of the world!
Two nights ago, I was comfortably ensconced in my great-grandfather's smoking chair, playing whist with a fellow diplomat, when my attention was diverted by the mesmerizing grunts and groans emanating from my big screen television set.  Initially, I vainly endeavored to ignore the strange sounds that were now pervading through my opulent, spacious home, but this effort was an exercise in utter futility; for my subsequent thoughts and actions were arrested by those immortal words that shall forever inspire me to fight bigotry and xenophobia--wherever it may be found: ""Get your stinking paws off of me you d--- dirty Ape!""
Upon hearing those stirring words, I rushed to the living room where my servants were paying rapt, almost worshipful, attention to the half-naked man rushing across the television screen in his heroic effort to evade his gorilla captors! Truly, One cannot faithfully put into words the emotions that were evoked within me at various times throughout the epic when Heston, yet again, outsmarted the Bolshevik apes who were singled-minded in their sick pursuit to carve out portions of his brain! (They took communist 'brainwashing' to a new extreme!)
But, Heston would not be so easily duped by the hairy devils' overtures of liberty, equality, and fraternity.  (He knew that they really wanted to kill him since he would not consent to their brainwashing techniques) Time and time again, the man who played Moses expressed his fervent ambition that the apes should ""let him go"" into the desert to live in peace ,away from the idolatry and the lewdness that pervaded the corrupt Ape-man civilization!
Drawing, if not downright stealing, from ""The Ten Commandments"", the director leads the viewer through a series of escapades reminiscent of DeMille's most famous picture. For instance, at the beginning of the film, we see a bored Heston, intent on only one thing, making romance with the sole female from earth, and much like Prince Moses in Demille's film, he was a military man of sorts, as evidenced by the fact that he was an Astronaut.  (Certainly he involved himself in a Military exercise when he attempted to execute brilliant escape and evasion maneuvers in the scintillating scene when the ape-people trampled his cohorts down with their horses).
The parallels do not end there!  When Heston refuses to quote the 'scriptures' of the gorilla's pagan religion in a dramatic court scene, one is reminded of Moses' staunch refusal to obey  celebrated pagan deities of the Egyptian court.  And, can anyone reasonably deny that the death and destruction that Heston wrought on the gorilla community in his attempt to evade their evil grasps is nothing more than an re-enactment of the the many curses and plagues that were visited upon the ancient Egyptians by Moses for refusing to let Heston and his people go?  And much like the exodus from Egypt, as the Hebrews left their former slavemasters loaded to the hilt with gold and riches, Heston is no less burdened with treasures.  (As the keen viewer will recall, Heston's ""exodus"" from the pagan gorilla village was blessed with the possession of many rifles, a horse, and a beautiful, if not ""brainwashed"", sidekick).
Nevertheless, despite the blatantly obvious ""theft"" of ideas from pictures past, this is a great movie!  It is full of action , drama, beauty, and suspense.  Its ultimate appeal,however, lies in its latent symbolism, the issues it endeavors to struggle with: bolshevism, paganism, and judaism.
This is a fantastic film.  I highly recommend it!",1002931200,,3628,5.070469798657718
345070,5,6301661729,"I recently watched this original version of ""The Planet of the Apes"" for the first time since seeing it at a drive-in theater back in 1968. First I was amazed at how much of the film I had forgotten. Actually, most of what I remembered was the (then) shocking ending. What I was impressed with this time around was what an intelligent and well-scripted film this was (and still is). Like any good science fiction, this film provides an interesting commentary on the human condition. One the one hand you have the Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith debunking and destroying an archeological dig, because it is contrary to the faith of the Apes, but on the other hand in his reading from the sacred scrolls you hear the accurate description of the destructive (dare I say ""sinful?"") nature of humans. I've been pondering this segment of the film quite a bit over the past few days. Like others, I think Charlton Heston is in fine form here. It's easy to picture him as president of the National Rifle Association after seeing this film. I still prefer Heston in ""Ben Hur"" and ""the Ten Commandments,"" but that probably reflects my personal interest in the stories that are told there. As one Academy Award film-maker recently said upon receiving his lifetime achievement Oscar (I think it was Norman Jewison), ""Find a story that needs to be told and tell it."" This version of ""The Planet of the Apes"" certainly tells a good story, and tells it well.",998870400,95,1457,4.651162790697675

This one will get your adrenalin pumping and has an excellent story and excellent cast.  Charlton Heston's character is a bit of a super-hero because he can fight apes, and we all know apes are many times stronger and quicker than men.  The new movie depicts this more accurately, but is not near as good as this original 1968 version with Heston, Roddy McDowell(an exellent ape) and Kim Hunter(the most sympathetic of chimpanzees)as well as Maurice Evens(whom you love to hate) and many others too numerous to mention.",998438400,,684,4.722689075630252

 PLANET OF THE APES IS CHARLTON HESTON'S BEST MOVIE!!! In his first science fiction movie, PLANET OF THE APES, Heston shows a greater range of emotions than ever before, as he goes from being a bored space commander to THE ULTIMATE RUNNING MAN! Jerry Goldsmith's score is sensational, and so is the photography, makeup, and acting of the rest of the cast of PLANET OF THE APES--especially virtually silent human leading lady Linda Harrison!--but it's Charlton Heston as Taylor--running, fighting, shooting, laughing, kissing, and finally, escaping the apes--that makes this the second best science fiction movie ever made, second only to FORBIDDEN PLANET.
 Heston turned down the lead role for the sequel, BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES--he later said in an interview, ""I thought at the time that as an actor I was above sequels, but later I discovered what Sylvester Stallone and others found out, that there's a lot of money in sequels!""--and he was very good in his later science fiction movies like SOYLENT GREEN and THE OMEGA MAN, but PLANET OF THE APES IS CHARLTON HESTON'S BEST MOVIE!!!

345104,5,6301661729,"Charlton Heston is simply great as the asronaut Taylor. His face perfectly conveys the feelings Taylor is having throughout the whole film. He starts out hating the human race, then becomes their principal defender, and finally sees his original feelings borne out in the shocker conclusion that I won't dare give away. The very underrated Roddy McDowal shines through all the makeup, and in fact all the ape actors are excellant. I don't think the film is anti-religious or anti-government because all the apes' assertions are actually proved true.

345106,5,6301661729,"""Planet of the Apes"" should be in any list of major movies of the 20th century because it is a poignant commentary on human behavior.  George Taylor (Charleton Heston) is one of four astronauts who crash land  on a planet where human beings are mute brutes dominated by intelligent  apes. Through Taylor's eyes, we observe the apes as they interact with each  other and with their human captives. We are treated, among other things, to  a wonderful commentary on American race relations as we discover that ape  society is stratified among orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees.  ""You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees,"" Dr. Zira  (Kim Hunter), referring to one of the orangutan elders, says to one of her  chimpanzee colleagues to which he responds ""the quota system has been  abolished! You made it. Why can't I?"" That the apes are meant to be  mirrors of human behavior is constantly reinforced throughout with  inversions of popular sayings and maxims: ""You know what they say-  human see; human do,"" one gorilla (Buck Karlitin) tells Dr. Zira.  Later. Later, an orangutan priest is overheard at a funeral saying  ""the deceased once said 'I never meant an ape I didn't like.""  When the apes discover that Taylor is indeed an intelligent, thinking  being, they are at a loss to explain him; he does not fit into their  theology or their scientific theories. One chimpanzee, however, Dr.  Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) believes Taylor might be the ""missing  link"" in his theory of evolution, and here we are treated to a  wonderful inversion of Charles Darwin. Taylor's presence triggers a crisis  in ape intellectual circles. Soon Taylor, Cornelius, and Zira are placed on  trial during which an orangutan prosecutor argues that apes possess the  spark of divine being with all of the passion and conviction of William  Jennings Bryan in the Scopes ""Monkey Trial"" of the 1920's. During  this trial, we discover that the orangutan elders are a shortsided and  dogmatic set whose medieval-like dogma keeps ape society and learning  static. The trial presents the chimpanzee scientists with only one option,  to prove their theories or face conviction for heresy. To this end, they  rescue Taylor from captivity and set out for ""The Forbidden  Zone,"" a desolate stretch of the planet that hides the secrets of the  apes' origin and where Taylor learns the truth about the Planet of apes  (unfortunately, that truth and the movie's ending is given away by the  video box cover, but after almost 32 years, almost everyone knows the  ending anyway). Planet of the Apes is suitable for all ages. Children will,  I think, enjoy the action and the apes; adults will enjoy the intelligent  script (written by Rod Serling of ""Twilight Zone"" fame, adapted  from Pierre Boulle's novel ""Les Planete Des Signes"") and  hilarious and chilling inversions of human behavior. Profanity (very  little, except perhaps the last scene which contains most of the movie's  profanity, which is tame by today's standards) and violence are minimal. In  short, this movie does so well what science fiction was meant to do:  portray human behavior.",967939200,8,3130,5.007782101167315

345109,5,6301661729,"Planet of the Apes, the film that is now renowned as one of the best (I think it's the best, personally) sci-fi films of all time, but it took a little while to finally get to the big screen.  The final result is nothing  short of a masterpiece.  The world weary astronaut Taylor and three other  astronauts (the woman dies, and it's pretty freaky.) crash land on some  unknown planet and find it is inhabited by intelligiant apes and the humans  are mute animals.  The animal/human roles are completely reversed.  Taylor  is brought to kinda of a labratory for animals.  He was shot in the neck so  he can't talk, ensuring his safety, for a little while.  Here Nova (Linda  Harrison) is introduced.  Nova is thrown into Taylor's cell and it is  announced that ""Dr Zira (Kim Hunter) wants those two humans to  mate.""  It is here that human privacy is invaded and makes the watcher  feel self-conscious about anything and everything they have ever done.  It's disgusting in a way, but witht he animal roles switched, it's  perfectly logical.  Taylor soon escapes.  During his run, he hides in the  museum and there sees one of his fellow astronauts stuffed and on display,  yet another chilling reality check in this film.  He is caught and  exclaims, ""Get your paws off me you damn dirty ape!""  During  about the time when this scene was shot during the origianl filming,  Charlton Heston got the flu, from running around in the skimpy attire he  had to wear, by the way.  After this, he is  put on trial in front of the  apes.  3 arangatangs (I didn't spell that right) are his judges.  Here, we  see the three going into denial as it becomes so obvious that Taylor is not  a missing link or a fluke but is a normal human being.  While doing this,  we see the ""hear, speak, see no evil"" being performed.  It's here  that the forbidden zone comes into play.  Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans, Edward  J. Robinson was originally slated for the role.), Cornelius (Roddy  McDowell), Dr. Zira, Taylor, and Nova all go there.  Here they find a fall  out shelter.  False teeth, eyeglasses, and a human doll that talks are  among the things they find.  Taylor is let go with Nova and with just less  that 5 minutes in the film, one of the most shocking endings in film  history comes into play.  Taylor comes upon the half buried statue of  liberty, ""You finally did it, you blew it up!  Damn you!  Damn you all  to hell! "" he exclaims in a powerful, shocking, and well damning  scene.
The message in this film is simple: nuclear war is an option we  must abolish.  The film warns against the horrors of nuclear war, it's that  simple.  It is this message that so many people over look and thus thing  this film is a pointless piece of entertainment held together by a bunch of  actors in rubber ape makeup that cost $1 million.  If that message is  brought into mind, even 30 years after, the film is still powerful.  It's  dated, yes, with the cold war over a decade, but is still a strong reminder  that we have to take responsibility now that nuclear annhilation is just a  push button away.  This film gives that message subtly, making it a  masterpiece, both in the Science Fiction genre and the gritty realist  drama.
But, to end my review on a high note, here are a few tidbits you  may not have known: a scene was cut from the film with Nova being pregnant.  The filmmakers decided the twist would take too much away from the  original plot (how would the child turn out?  would Taylor and Nova create  a whole new intelligiant human race?  This ending would give the hint that  maybe the human race can have a second chance, but that wouldn't of  worked.)  In the original screen test, Linda Harrison was tested for Dr  Zira.  In the book, the apes are very intelligiant, with flying machines,  and high tech houses.  The budget wouldn't alloy that so their society was  made more primative.  The houses were contructed with cardboard and a type  of foam, copying a type of house found in Europe, where the houses are  carved into hillsides.  There are four sequels to this film: Beneath-,  Escape from-, Conquest of-, and Battle for- The Planet of the Apes.",963360000,3,4153,4.505420054200542

After seeing it a few more times as I matured, I began to realize how sophisticated the concepts in this  film really are.  The makeup, sound, and cinematography are top notch  (especially for 1968!).  The story is riveting, and the ending is  legendary.  Even if your'e not a fan of science fiction, this one is still  well worth seeing.  If you are, and you haven't seen this one in a while,  treat yourself.

It's tempting, though  wrong, to simply view PLANET OF THE APES as just another stone in the APE  avalanche.  But what those who have not yet seen it don't realize is that  the reason why PLANET OF THE APES gave rise to so many sequels, etc., is  because it was absolutely fantastic!  The original, standing alone, is  quite rightly considered a classic.  To those who do not like science  fiction movies, I'll just say that PLANET OF THE APES is a great movie--it  just so happens to be a science fiction movie, so don't let that stop you.  It is so much deeper philosophically, spiritually, etc., than the  run-of-the-mill SF movie.  It is one of the very few movies that I've seen  that is profoundly thought-provoking and yet magnificently entertaining.  The apes have created their own philosophy, religion, law, government, and  scientific truths.  The tables are turned on mankind when Taylor (Charlton  Heston), an astronaut stranded on this strange planet, finds himself  hunted, captured, analyzed, prosecuted, and persecuted.  If you are  avoiding PLANET OF THE APES because you think it is just a silly movie  about talking apes, then you're denying yourself of the experience that  only a truly great movie can offer.

345167,5,6301661729,"Originally intended as a project for Blake Edwards, the film version of Pierre Boulle's semisatric sci-fi novel came to the screen in 1968 under the directorial guidance of Franklin J. Schaffner. Charlton Heston is George Taylor, one of several astronauts on a long, long space mission whose spaceship crashlands on a remote planet, seemingly devoid of intelligent life. Soon the astronaut learns that this planet is ruled by a race of talking, thinking, reasoning apes who hold court over a complex multilayered civilization. In this topsy-turvy society, the human beings are grunting, inarticulate primates, penned-up like animals. When ape leader Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) discovers that the captive Taylor has the power of speech, he reacts in horror and insists that the astronaut be killed. But sympathetic ape scientists Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) risk their lives to protect Taylor--at to discover the secret of their planet's history that Dr. Zaius and his minions guard so jealously. In the end, it is Taylor who stumbles on the truth of the Planet of the Apes.

  Scripted by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson, ""PLANET OF THE APES"" has gone on to be an all-time sci-fi classic. It won a special Academy Award for John Chambers' convincing simian makeup.

345168,5,6301661729,"I was so excited when I found I could get a copy of ""Planet of the Apes"".  I remember the first time I saw this movie at the theater and the shock of the unexpected ending on the beach.  I wanted my son who was  born after this movie was released to see a really great movie.  After  receiving the movie in the mail, I couldn't believe the front picture  packaging on the video case.  There on the front of the case was a picture  of the ""Statute of Liberty"".  Then I found out that the brief  ""Special Behind-The-Scenes Footage"" was included prior to the  beginning of the movie, how the ""Statute of Liberty"" scene was  made.  I was truly disappointed when I asked my son how he liked the movie  and the climatic ending.  He said he figured out the ending before the  movie started due to someone's smart decision to include the  ""Behind-the-Scenes Footage"" at the beginning of the video tape.  All I can say if I had known this, I wouldn't bought this video.  Please  put the ""Behind-the-Scenes Footage"" at the end of the movie and  remove the ""Statute of Liberty"" from the front package. I hope  20th Century Fox is listening. It ruins the movie plot for those who have  not seen this movie. This review probably won't be posted since it probably  reveals ""crucial plot elements"" of the movie. I wouldn't want to  spoil it for all others.

7813885,5,6301661729,"With its excellent performances and tight, smart script written by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson (based on the book by Pierre Boulle), this is a film that stays fresh and interesting even with repeated viewings. Released the same year as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", both films are at the top of my ""super sci-fi"" list, and stack up against the best of what has been released in recent years, which relies more than ever on special effects to tell the story; the effects in ""Planet of the Apes"" are minimal, and it's the latex make-up that is the marvel, and garnered John Chambers a Special Award at the Oscars for his work, which allows the ape characters full freedom of facial expressions. Oscar nominations went for costume design, and the marvelous score by Jerry Goldsmith.
The cinematography by Leon Shamroy is also fantastic, and I love the aerial descent that starts the film.
Charlton Heston as the astronaut who lands in an ""upside down world"", and Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall as free thinking scientists are superb, and in smaller roles, Maurice Evans, James Whitmore and James Daly terrific as authority figures in the ape colony.
This film had four sequels, a TV series and a cartoon series, as well as a multitude of merchandise from plastic figurines to bubble gum cards, but the original stays pristine and untarnished by its often silly spin-offs, and is a one-of-a-kind classic.
What this film has, that one can appreciate even when one knows what it is, is that rare thing...a great ending. Very few films leave one with a satisfied feeling at their close, but this one is unique, brilliantly filmed, and like a perfect dessert after a good meal.

7813886,5,6301661729,"The box cover is a bit of a spoiler. This is unfortunate, because the first time you see this film, the ending is a real shocker. Don't ask anyone what I mean; watch it without knowing the ending, and let yourself take the wild roller coaster drop when you see it.
The casting is unusual and brilliant. Kim Hunter, best known for winning the supporting actress Oscar for A Streetcar Named Desire, plays Zira, a chimpanzee who is a psychologist studying human behavior. Former child star Roddy McDowell plays her husband, Cornelius. Charleton Heston is Taylor, a talking human who shakes up the ape society's view of itself as the species created in the image of god.
The set design and costumes hint of ""B"" IAP movies, but this is not a B-film. It is a brilliant, heavy-handed, yet not didactic commentary on human society; it is as true now as it was when it was first released upon the Vietnam-era United States.
Though there are sly backhands at the government that got us into Vietnam, and created the ""generation gap,"" the larger commentary on race relations and the treatment of non-human animals is staggering.
The ape make-up is pure art, and the film is watchable just for the human actors bringing the ape faces to life. But it's watchable for much more than thrills; watch it for its message: because of the ape allegory, the film makes many statements that couldn't be made directly.
On top of it all, this is plain fun, science fiction, and a fantastic action film.
Rated G when you could say ""damn"" in a G film, this film is something that children will love-- though there's so much in it, and adult won't pick it all up without repeated viewings.

7813887,5,6301661729,"Embedded within the deep layers of what appears to be a simple science fiction flick from the 60s, Planet of the Apes delves into the issue of existence and evolution without turning into a documentary. One must marvel at Franklin J. Schaffner's ability to make something this scientific and controversial work on the big screen.
One of the great aspects of the film is the slow build up of tension at the film's outset. Taylor (played by Charlton Heston) is aboard a spaceship with a few other explorers as the ship careens slowly through space. The gloomy outlook that Taylor possesses on existence (he says mechanically ""I feel lonely"") is only outweighed by the mysterious existence of time travel. The ship lands in the year 3978 in the waters of some land, and those who survive are left to discover exactly where they are and what time they are living in.
Although it is a physical journey, there is also a philosophical journey for Taylor. He adopts the standpoint that ""life is meaningless"", appearing rebellious against the human spirit. Seemingly, he is not only escaping time but, in his bitterness, looking for something better than mankind.
The progression of discoveries in the first part establishes a mood of slight creepiness. This is not a movie that rushes the critical points of background information so it can cut to the chase; instead, the viewer is experiencing the journey of a new land with the travelers. The crew begins to find small existences of life (waterfall, plant life, footprints). Ultimately, they discover that humans are there, but this discovery is truly ironic.
We eventually discover that there is a twist to this society. The role-reversal is that apes rule people. Not only are humans ruled, but also kept captive and treated as the inferior race (""beasts"" is what one of the apes says when referring to a human). Apes believe humans are dirty. The apes are doctors, scientists, guards, philosophers and leaders while humans are lacking intelligence and the ability to speak (except for Taylor). Also within this topsy-turvy world many of the expressions are reversed to fit the apes' world (""Human see, human do."").
The question of origin is the movie's main subject. Cornelius, one of the apes, announces to one of the leaders his theorem that ""ape evolved from man"", based on his findings in The Forbidden Zone (a land that is seclude from society of apes). This viewpoint is naturally construed as ridiculous and impossible by many of the apes. Taylor searches for a way to escape, and, at the same time, tries to come to terms with an understanding of how society evolved this way.
In one form, the movie is a commentary on both evolution and individual and societal identity (or lack thereof). Taylor's ultimate discovery is a subject of irony and devastation, his destiny being his ultimate fear. Masterfully put together, Planet of the Apes mixes a blend of sci-fi, action, creepiness and commentary that not only produce a good movie, but an intelligent one as well.",1057795200,,3020,4.911937377690802
7813888,5,6301661729,"It had been a long time since I had seen this movie, and if you are thinking about doing so also, then don't read the box.  It doesn't give away the ending; the box is merely wrong.  Zira is the one who takes in Taylor and not Cornelius.
This version of ""Planet of the Apes"" had a lot of things to say, unlike the more recent version.  Here, the humans are incapable of speech and intelligent thought.  This movie does not say that apes evolved from man, but that man's violent nature and penchant for war and destruction took him down a few rungs.  The apes merely kept evolving.  Given that this was from the late 60s, this is probably an anti-war message.
This movie also talks about science and religion.  The argument between the older generation-religion, represented by orangutans, and the younger generation-science, represented by the chimpanzees.
I don't think that looking at the inner message will ruin this film.  Rather, it brings a more enhanced appreciation of the film.  I would highly recommend watching this film.",1034035200,,1032,4.752808988764045
