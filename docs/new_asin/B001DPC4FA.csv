3535846,5,B001DPC4FA,"This is a great in depth instructional DVD on Rudiments applied to the drumset that make musical sence.  Todd is the currently the drummer for Styx and he showcases a talent in this DVD far beyond what he does for the band.
The DVD is shot in a beautiful scenic location in HD.  Visually this DVD has no equal.  The sound is also great.
Sucherman demonstrates his licks in full speed and trys to slow them down.  Some are just slowed down by editing the footage to half speed.
The only thing that was just plain bad was the packaging.  It came with the DVD's loose, the center holder thing crushed and could have possibly damage the playing surface.  When I opened the plastic wrap and opened the cover on of the DVD's just floped out on the floor.  Cheep crap.  Otherwise a great DVD.",1233792000,,785,4.36551724137931
3535847,5,B001DPC4FA,"I am a drumming DVD junkie (>20) so I have something to compare to. Some DVDs display incredible musical talent by the author.  Some share insights and approaches to music.  Some offer instruction on technique.  Very few do all of these, and even fewer still do all, well.  I'm a huge Steve Gadd fan, but his DVDs (which I love) are more a bit of phenomenal playing mixed with some insights and approaches.  JoJo Mayers DVD (another must have) is largely technique with a bit of performance.  In contrast, Steve Smith's DVD's offer everything and do it extremely well.  Add Todd Sucherman's DVD to the latter list.  His sticking on a pad is first rate, but not always ""perfect"" (so the rest of us can relate), and his actual performances are FABULOUS.  He covers everything from practicing rudiments, to applying these to the kit in a musical way, to his approach to multiple styles (rock, jass etc), along with quite a bit of insight as to how he approaches playing a particular piece.  So far, I've only seen Steve Smith and Neil Peart cover all the bases like this and do it well, but Todd's DVD is right there with them.  Among many favorite DVDs, this is in the top 3.  If there is any ""weakness"" it's that Todd covers so many issues, that some are dealt with rather superficially.  I don't really consider this a weakness though since he has a knack for knowing which issues deserve more or less time (and he acknowledges upfront that he can't possible go into as much detail as he might want).  The added bonus is great audio and video production at a beautiful recording studio, and enough dialog from Todd that you get a sense of knowing him a bit.  He is incredibly talented, humble, not afraid to state an opinion, humorous etc all at the same time.  Who wouldn't want to meet this guy after seeing his DVD?  Excellent DVD, Mr. Sucherman!  When your time permits, how 'bout another one someday?",1232409600,20,1905,4.552941176470588
3535878,5,B001DPC4FA,"I first saw Todd on the Modern Drummer Festival 2008 DVD. It took a few watches for me to figure out just how very great he is. As this unfolded, I couldn't get enough. Then I saw him live with Styx and his contributions to that band amazed me. His presence and power blew me away.

I had to get ""Methods and Mechanics"" and I am so glad I did. It is an articulate presentation of the soul of drumming. Todd has a way of drawing you in and then he presents concepts in musical thought so as to contribute beautifully to the music at hand. The way to strike something; what to tap/hit and when; when to build; when to back off; when to use color and on and on...............

There is plenty of technique displayed too but the musical concepts are what got me. Todd's personality and his engaging way of getting you to listen is monumental. It's not just the drums. It's everything that goes with them to be successful in your own setting. Tremendous!

Thank you Todd for doing this fabulous DVD for all us drummers!",1287273600,3,1014,4.326315789473684
3535879,5,B001DPC4FA,"This dvd is overall fantastic. I grew up loving Styx so of course Todd is now one of my favorite drummers. The insight, advice and approaches to musicality Todd offers in this dvd is second to none. It is not as accessible to the beginning drummer and he does move rather quickly from time to time but with a remote this isn't a big deal. I think what Sucherman was trying to do was give advice on musicality and to the professional drummer which he does a fantastic job of it! He provides plenty of inspiration and ideas for playing as well as for being a drummer. He inspires you to keep playing regardless of your current situation. This isn't a dvd I would recommend if you are really looking for technical advice for developing your chops. However, this dvd is a must have! I have yet to come across such a dvd that covers the real life topics that we all face as musicians. Todd Sucherman did a fantastic job!",1272499200,,915,4.356725146198831
3535880,5,B001DPC4FA,This is a great DVD! I am a novice drummer and there is a good deal of information about rudiments and exercises to either use to warm up or learn hand coordination. There is a lot of information here to keep me learning for a long time. And there are other interesting entertaining parts of the DVD that are not teaching you how to drum.,1270166400,,338,4.2153846153846155
3535881,2,B001DPC4FA,"While reading the reviews here, I was sure I am in for a treat.
When I saw the two DVD""s yesterday, I was really disappointed.
While Todd is really nice, funny, and amazing drummer  , he rush things out.

First the DVD is definitely not for beginners, second even if you want to get something out of it, prepare the remote control, because there is a lot of pause and play activity that's going to happen.

In the First DVD Todd is rushing over the rudiments, it is very clear to the viewer  that he isn't enjoying it, while lecturing on how calm, spiritual, nice, clean, and dynamic you have to be, Todd is hammering the pad with a lot of intensity, and nervous.

Jumping all over the place from rudiment to rudiment in very high speed, next he show those rudiment on the drums, he doesn't bother to show what he play on notes. So you have to pause\ play  again  and again slowly like you are trying to get the drum part out of a live show  very annoying.

Also many parts Todd simply play Styx songs, what am I suppose to learn from them ?
before every song there is an introduction of few min explaining what he was trying to ""achieve "" while writing this parts .

This DVD looks like a publicity DVD of Todd, and less learning  DVD.",1263945600,5,1236,4.239316239316239
3535882,4,B001DPC4FA,This is a really good instructional dvd for beginners to professionals. Todd was very simple in explaining his techniques. A must have for everyone.,1256428800,,148,5.208333333333333
3535883,5,B001DPC4FA,"No longer a total beginner, you've spent serious time practicing at least some of the rudiments that drumming teachers always harp on. You've also played around on the drumset a bit. But how do these two very different ways of drumming line up?

The first disc of this DVD shows you exactly how they line up as Todd Sucherman (drummer for Chicago and Styx and other bands) goes through some dozen or so rudiments, shows how to play them, slows down the sticking, then translates them into grooves and fills and interesting ways to practice by playing with the tempo and accents and hybrids. The second disc gets into jazz drumming and includes Todd playing along with the music going. Also includes solos and descriptions of how to put them together.

Least helpful for me were the (fortunately) short tips on how to get hired as a drummer. Most impressive besides the clear and often humorous instruction--remember, all real drummers have an attitude--was the ease with which Todd shows how to really play from the heart with feeling, using the vocabulary of the rudiments to open up the soul of drumming.",1254614400,4,1106,4.785340314136126
3535884,5,B001DPC4FA,"This is a great DVD!  Informative, inspiring and very well thought out.  I own a lot of drum DVDs and this has to be one of the best if not the best so far.  My litmus test for instructional drumming DVDs is ""Did I learn something?"".  Some are better than others.  There are other really good DVDs by other drummers but I sometimes feel that they are holding back just a little, making sure not to divulge too many secrets.  Some other drummers' DVDs are nothing more than interviews and narratives that leave me wanting a refund.

Todd Sucherman's DVD is really worth buying.  He does a great job explaining and demonstrating how and why.  For example, he does an excellent job demonstrating rudiments, hybrid rudiments, rudiments tied together with conjuntions - and then he shows you ways to apply them to the drum kit.  But there's a lot more than rudiments on this DVD. His insights are are truly (well) insightful.  One of my favorites is entitled The Right Reasons.  Todd is as much a mentor as he is an instructor.

I would have liked more PDF material, for example some notation on that cool groove that Todd plays during the intro to the DVD or perhaps notation for the paradiddle-diddle jazz groove (to get a better understanding of the bass and snare note placements) but these are minor concerns.

I hope there's another Todd Sucherman DVD in the works.  This one was top notch!",1251936000,2,1391,4.597560975609756
3535885,5,B001DPC4FA,"This DVD is way more than just a ""Learn a few licks and technique tips"" kind of video. It is truly one of the most inspiring drumming DVD's for musicality, and for just plain... living. This DVD completely revolutionized the way I play and think about drumming to a song. Even though I've watched this DVD to many times to count, if I lost it I would straight away pick up a new copy, because it reinvigorates a love for the drums stronger then ever.",1249948800,4,450,4.305882352941176
3535886,5,B001DPC4FA,"This is a must have for any drummer. I am a full time drummer and own many dvds. This DVD, IMHO, is the best I have ever seen and the most important in my collection. Todd's a great guy, funny, and presents his information in a very organized and concise way. I would recommend this dvd for any drummer that is beginner to advanced.",1238889600,2,332,4.203125
3535887,5,B001DPC4FA,"Todd did a clinic here in Boise, Idaho, a couple weeks ago and it was fantastic. He's a very down-to-earth guy with a lot of wisdom and good advice. He talked, told stories, played solos and played along with songs, answered questions, and signed dvds for about three hours! His playing was inspirational and educational. One of my drum students bought Todd's dvd and we've been watching it together and benefiting from it. The production values are top notch and I agree with the other reviewer here who said that this video does a wonderful job of covering a lot of bases. This goes on the top shelf of my drum videos, along with JoJo Mayer's, Steve Smith's, and Jack DeJohnettes's (""Musical Expression on the Drum Set""). The price is also great: a lifetime of drumming insight for less than thirty bucks! By the way, to the reviewer who slammed the ""cheep"" packaging (did it sound like a bird?): the packaging is totally fine and also high quality; those little plastic holders break in shipping all the time. I have had it happen on numerous new cds I bought from the store or online.",1238457600,7,1088,4.61340206185567
8294462,5,B001DPC4FA,Interesting for sure & alot of tips.,1515974400,,36,4.285714285714286
8294463,5,B001DPC4FA,"This is an amazing tool for drummers to use from intermediate playing levels up to a pro level. Todd does a great job explaining exercises before performing them, as well as shows the notations and stickings  on screen and even breaks into slow motion videos. I would recommend this product 100% to anyone thinking about it! This video has provided me personally with new ideas and new concepts behind the drum set and sparked a new creative level of playing every day.",1503532800,,469,4.719512195121951
8294464,5,B001DPC4FA,"Would consider this a very good teaching device, with lots of video to see his technique.",1456790400,,89,4.625
8294465,5,B001DPC4FA,"This dude is a monster on the cans....I am a self-taught joker on the cans, so watching Todd is about all I can do as of right now...he's waaaay too advanced for me, but one day I'll get there! Great guy great DVDs",1452384000,,214,4.0
8294466,5,B001DPC4FA,"This is a really good DVD by Todd. Instead of just going over this is RR and this is LL, Todd gives an inspiring lesson on many cool beats and patterns you can apply or use to enrich your playing. The DVD really re ignited a dimming fire with-in me in drumming behind the kit, as i've been playing for many years and it was getting old. Todd's approach will inspire you to practice what he has packed into this DVD. His explanation of some sticking patterns and licks on the kit will have you laughing and get you playing along! If you are a beginner, you can learn so much and go from a beginning level right up to an intermediate and ENJOY going over lessons.",1386806400,,661,4.21259842519685
8294467,5,B001DPC4FA,"As a drummer, what would you pay to hang out for a day with one of the very best drummers in the world, where he would share with you the keys to becoming a better drummer and how to succeed in the music business? This DVD takes you on a five plus hour journey where you learn so much from Todd--from lessons, to demonstrations through solos and playing on songs that have been well chosen, to learning about his gear and why he uses what he uses, to advice on how to be successful as a professional drummer in the music business. His lessons cover the basic rudiments and hybrids and variations on them. You get to sit across the practice pad in front of Todd while he explains and then demonstrates those rudiments slowly and then increasing in tempo up to blazing fast speeds in stunning high definition, which puts you right there. The way Todd uses the analogy of the rudiments being similar to words in a language and how learning those words provide the keys to forming sentences is extraordinarily clear and helps beginners to understand the importance of learning these building blocks for successful playing. Todd then applies those rudiments to the drum set in a superb manner, while you look on from beside his beautiful kit. He then takes you through so many practical lessons such as fills using combinations between the hands and double bass drums (or double bass drum pedals). He covers a number of great lessons not commonly found in instructional DVDs such as odd time signatures and how to break them down to be able to successfully play them. He plays many styles of music during the course of the DVD. Todd uses a very relaxed speaking style that makes it seem like you and he are just hanging out one on one; all the while he is sharing incredibly valuable information and demonstrating it on his drum kit for you. Even though this DVD indicates that it is for intermediate and advanced players, it is useful for beginners as well because of the way he presents the rudiments. This is a DVD that someone can use and refer back to throughout their progression as a drummer. Probably the most valuable part of the DVD is Todd's advice on being successful as a professional musician, which also applies to success in any career path. Todd's advice will serve anyone well throughout life in general as well. It is obvious from this DVD that Todd is a very articulate, generous, humble, and funny person who has made many life long friends as a result of how he treats others. Most people who reach the pinnacle of their profession are so focused on that goal that they are frequently jerks or boring, and most are unwilling to take the time to share the keys to their success. This is not the case with Todd, who took a great deal of personal time and effort to share so much practical and useful information with so many drummers. I have DVDs from Steve Smith, Tommy Igoe, and others, but this is by far the best one I own. I plan to give it to my three year old grandson (an aspiring drummer) when he is older as it will be just as relevant and valuable in thirty years as it today. Buy this DVD; it will be one of the best purchases you ever make as a drummer.",1361923200,,3181,4.457975986277873
8294468,5,B001DPC4FA,They had it for a Great price . It was well packed. And the shipping was fast. Two thumbs up.,1358899200,,93,3.7
8294469,5,B001DPC4FA,"Todd did a great job on this DVD.  Whether you are a beginer or advanced player you will find this DVD entertaining and it will inspire you to be a better drummer.  He starts of the snare drum and shows you the rudiments.  Next expands the concepts and shows you how to apply them to the drumset.  Then he tops it off by showing how he has applied them in his playing by demonstrating them to the songs he has played with Styx, Taylor Mills, and more.  Todd is a very practical instructor and never loses sight of his goal ""Methods and Mechanics for Useful Muscial Drumming"".",1353283200,5,575,4.336448598130841
8294470,5,B001DPC4FA,"This DVD is not for anyone who hasn't learnt their Rudiments yet. It is for Intermediate to Advanced players. Once you learn the stickings & feel for the Rudiments at speed this DVD will show you some cool ways to apply them to the Drum Kit, making it a fun way to get away from thinking that Rudiments are just for the Practice Pad & boring. If only I had this DVD years ago. However as Todd suggests he is just showing you some variations of some of the Rudiments, you should then think of any & every way to come up with your own variations moving Accents different time feels/meters etc. Todd is a funny person & a good teacher. I can easily see how it won Modern Drummer 2009 Readers Poll. In my opinion you can't go wrong buying this DVD.",1312761600,5,744,4.20979020979021
8294471,5,B001DPC4FA,"Very good instructional Drum DVD for any level of playing. Great audio and visual effects,explained with precision from a master of the drum kit. Also includes drum playing tips and hints from Todd.",1300492800,2,198,5.03030303030303
