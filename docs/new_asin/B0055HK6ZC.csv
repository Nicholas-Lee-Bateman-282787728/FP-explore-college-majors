8458387,4,B0055HK6ZC,"Anyone who loves Lucy would love there to be more. And there is, sort of. This collection of two double-sided discs is billed as 7 episodes, which it's not. It includes two famous episodes, ""The Barbershop"", in which Lucy joins a female barbershop quartet, and ""The Plumber"", in which she and Vivian Vance get stuck in the shower while trying to do home repairs. These two episodes are available together on a separate DVD, and were issued separately on VHS before that. The other five offerings lie more in the nature of biopics and tributes. This set seems to be a collection in the sense that each of the discs was likely issued separately before, and probably the bits were spread over various VHS tapes before that. For instance, Disc 2, side A is entitled ""The Funny World of Lucy, Vols I and II. At the end of Vol I, there's a commercial for Vol. II, here included on the same disc.

There probably isn't much in the way of lost Lucy material, because the same bits are repeated at least four times on these discs, sometimes in small snippets, and sometimes larger pieces. That makes the five shows very redundant. However, part of the strength of this collection is you have all five shows in one set, and know which bits are on which discs. As is typical of this sort of bargain-priced set, there is no paper menu inside to tell you what's on these discs. However, when you put a disc in, the onscreen information tells you what's on the flip side. They don't follow the order on the case either, but the presentation on both the case and the screen is attractive. All the actual shows are from Good Times Video, although this set is from Gaiam.

So what's on the discs? Disc One, side A is called ""Lucy's Lost Episodes"", and includes bits from Ed Sullivan's show, ""Toast of the Town"" in 1954, ""What's My Line"" in 1955, The Bob Hope Chevy Show"" in 1956, from the Lucy/ Desi movie ""Forever Darling"" in 1956, a long comedy bit incorporating ads for the sponsor, Westinghouse, in 1959, various clips from the 1960s, 1962 movie bloopers, and bits from 1965-'66. All of the pieces are repeated, in whole or in part, in other places on these discs. Disc one, side B includes ""A Tribute to Lucy"", along with the full episodes of ""The Barbershop"" and ""The Plumber"".

Disc 2, side A includes Vols I and II of ""The Funny World of Lucy"". Part one is a long biopic of Lucy's entire career, which includes cuts from appearances on the Dick Cavett and Merv Griffin shows, and a dozen very early black and white films from a bygone era. The documentary is copyrighted Film Shows Inc. Vol. II gives a brief biographical recap. and picks up in 1958, when Desilu Productions brought the entire RKO Pictures studio lot. It briefly covers the 179 episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" and there are brief color bits from when the ""Lucy Show"" went color in 1965. Lucy and Desi's divorce in 1960 is briefly touched on, along with the later ""Here's Lucy"" episodes. Vol. II runs 1.5 hours. Side B of disc 2 includes the very funny Lucy episode with Ed Sullivan, actually done for his show, ""Toast of the Town"", snippets of which show up at least three other times in this set. Next is the Bob Hope Chevy Show, pieces of which are also scattered throughout this collection.

What's unusual is The Circus of Saints and Sinners, a Hollywood group something like the Friar's Club, which does a roast/ toast to Lucy and Desi. We learn that the episode in which Lucy has little Ricky, which was timed to correspond to the birth of their actual child, was watched by 83 million people. Quite a feat considering how few people had TVs in those days. The episode was checked by a rabbi, a priest, and a minister to make sure it wouldn't offend anyone. There are at least three places where the stars work in long ads and jokes for their sponsor, Lincoln-Mercury. As many people know, ""I Love Lucy"" was originally sponsored by Phillip-Morris cigarettes. Side two ends with a very long piece of the Bob Hope Chevy Show, in which Hope tells political jokes, and there are many other acts as well as Lucy and Desi.

Any Lucy fan would, I think enjoy this set. The tributes/ biopics manage to be interesting and informative without being exposes or stressing scandal, as would so many later documentaries. Even as a long time Lucy fan, I learned quite a bit. Lucy appeared in more than seventy films, and it was interesting to see little bits or parts of trailers for them. Hers really is a rags to riches story with nothing in between. How very sad that life in Hollywood so often seemed to veer violently between dirt broke and wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice, with no stops in between, nothing one might call normal.

It does help explain the deleterious effect that a showbiz career seems to have on so many people, and why after a while producers of TV and films seem to so entirely lose sight of what common people would like to watch, and cease to share their values. People are taking back their cable boxes in record numbers, and staying away from the theaters except for well-done family films. Even TV networks have finally realized that viewers would rather watch these old shows which were eminently watchable as opposed to their expensive, extreme, and mostly offensive shows that are, more often than not, stillborn. Those will never last, despite all the current propaganda. But this one always will. As this collection shows, as long as there is a human race, viewers will always love Lucy.",1324857600,7,5471,4.566191446028514
