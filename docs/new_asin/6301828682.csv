Both of my boys are grown now, but this movie made a big impact on them. It's a wonderfully positive movie. The boys are planning a holiday. They have all boarded a ship with plans on taking off in the morning. I won't spoil how it happens, but the boys end up casting off without any adults on board. The boys end up shipwrecked on an island. They cooperate to overcome difficulties. My older son, who is now 24, says, this movie is the way Lord of the Flies *should* have gone.
This was their video of choice. Our goto when they were sick and had to hang out on the couch.",1508976000,,682,4.174242424242424

I like the characters, the shipwrecked story, music, and the boys friendship in the movie. Even if it is an older movie now, it's still great. I heard this story was taken from a Jules Verne book, so I will definitely have to get the book.",1373328000,,342,4.196969696969697
7816381,4,6301828682,"I saw this film when I was young and remembered enjoying it.
The particular scene where the kids fall down the hole and finds a secret room stayed in my mind. It was an imaginative concept that I've never seen before, and it really left an wonderful impression within me.

Years later after a lot of research I was able to track this film down and was surprised a DVD edition has yet to be released. I purchased a VHS copy on Amazon.com, and received it in the mail soon afterwords. Unfortunately, this film has aged quite a bit and it's not as memorable as it once was. I would love to see this film re-done!

However, it's still a recommended watch, especially for the younger viewers.",1258243200,3,687,4.4015748031496065
7816382,5,6301828682,"I haven't seen this movie in about 15 years, and I think about every now and again. I am 27, and am going to buy it and copy to DVD. Then add it to my 300+ DVD collection.",1154217600,,171,3.526315789473684
7816383,4,6301828682,"I fell in love with this movie as a small boy, and I'm still quite fond of  it well into my later 20's.  If you enjoyed watching the original  ""Treasure Island"", as a child, or have found yourself sitting  down with your kids watching Brian Henson's version of ""Treasure  Island""(The Muppets), than this is another great shipwreacked story  for you.  A well animated movie for it's time, it features 15 school  children lost at sea learning how to survive on their own.  It teaches your  children the meaning of true frienship to it's fullest.  This is the  childrens version of that show, ""Survivor"", you adults love to  watch, but with a strong meaning behind it.  So now you know.  A little  something for you.  A little something for the kids.  How could you not  want to watch this with your children.  They'll be glad you did, and so  will you.",968544000,2,850,4.533333333333333
