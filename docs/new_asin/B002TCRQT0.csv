This is an interesting story on how a man tried to take advantage of peoples economic distress. Does this still occur today? Do you know of any examples today? Did the New Deal laws alleviate peoples problems? A thousand years ago the word wolf was given to bandits who preyed upon people. It is still used today, as in that movie The Wolf of Wall Street. The Lone Rider character seems like a copy of The Lone Ranger.",1507420800,,2343,4.441860465116279
