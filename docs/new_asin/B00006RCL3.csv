1787066,5,B00006RCL3,"This film is the first work I have viewed of Director, Zhang Yimou.

It is a wonderful story of hope and love.  It also shows the contrast of a person raised during China's total embrace of communism and how he copes both morally and emotionally with Chinese  communism's embrace of the free market.  It is a story of love and hope.  An umemployed factory worker and a blind 18 year old are the heroes of this movie.  Simply, it is a lovely film and viewing it you will feel better about people.  Watch out Hollywood, Chinese cinema is no longer just Kung Fu movies.  Director Zhang Yimou knows how to tell a story, without off color language or gratuitous sex scenes.  Only goes to show you a good script transcends all language barriers.",1106438400,13,739,4.496240601503759
1787067,5,B00006RCL3,"This is a story about ordinary folks. It may seem unreal as a whole but it's not hard find every single person in the real life. How many movies are completely real stories? So put them together to make a drama which also looks like comedy and a little tragedy (for the teenage girl who is definitely not 18 as she told  and has to leave those who showed care and love on her and and for Zhao who was blamed as a liar and lost his ""love"" again and was injurred by an unneccessary accident).

Unlike some other Yimou's moveis, this movie was not focusing on the poverty but on love. An unemployeed (his factory was half closed and had no pay to give out)old man Zhao seeked love and did his best he could to make his new date happy. The fat woman turned out to be a savvy gold digger type and took advantage of his love to let him to help her dump her untanted blind stepdaughter. While trying hard, with his scarce money, to please his date Zhao had to take care of the blind girl who had been abandoned by her stepmother and was neglected by her biological father. Troubled by lacking of money, Zhao and his fellow workers set up a fake massage parlor to ""hire"" the girl to do the only thing she can do. They even gave real tips to the girl though they themself were all not rich, even poor. But this could not last long so they decide to give paper as money to make her stay to avoid her dangerous leaving-out. The fat woman kicked Zhao out after her new lover (seemed to be the girl's father who seemed to have made a lot of money but did not show sign to find her daughter and cure her eye) came back and blamed Zhao as a liar. Yes Zhao lied to her about his fake hotel and finacial situation but not about his love to her. The girl also found out the massage parlor was fake and the later paper money were fake but she did not feel being deceived but felt being loved by those unknown folks who are not her father and stepmother. Not wanting to add more burden to these nice guys the girl left secretly, not even waitng for anotehr fake letter from her father. Probably she knew her father did not even care about her. Like she said her happies times were those while she were with Zhao and his fellow workers. The whole story was smoothly told and was toutchng. Every single person has his or her unique characters through out the whole movie, making it real life like and vivid. It's hard to find this kind stylish movies in Hollywood.",1106092800,8,2442,4.204690831556503

I've long been a film buff - my favorite films tend to be artsy and rather pedantic.  Because of this, my family generally doesn't like to sit with me and watch movies.
So, when I started ""Happy Times"" last night, I thought they'd gradually wander off and find something else to do.
But, they were enthralled!  This movie is the perfect balancing act between comedy, drama, and the enduring love we feel for those who have touched us in a special way.
This is a great, great movie.
Too many Americans shun foreign films.  This is one they shouldn't miss.  When the movie ended, my oldest son turned to me and said, ""Wow.  I think Hollywood has forgotten how to make movies like this!""
American filmmakers seem to think they have to descend to the baser instincts in order to make ""adult"" movies.
Yet, ""Happy Times"" - and countless other foreign films - never seem to sink to this level.  These films are always excellent.
I think the issue is that Hollywood has forgotten how to write a good story; they've forgotten that basic human values can be enduring, can be entertaining, if only they would jettison their cynical baggage.
""Happy Times"" will make you laugh and cry, smile and reflect with pride on the better angels of our nature.

1787070,5,B00006RCL3,"As a longtime fan of director Zhang Yimou, I was surprised to see him change directions with 1998's Not One Less. After watching his four most recent films (Not One Less, The Road Home, Happy Times and Hero), I can say with assurance that Zhang Yimou is not changing directions but branching out. He can direct almost anything. I've always appreciated movies that had both comedy and drama and defied categorization. Too bad Blockbuster can easy categorize this film under ""Foreign."" Happy Times starts off lighthearted and easily amusing, but becomes more complicated as it progresses. I can compare this movie to a more well-known and more controversial one, Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful. Happy Times is not striking like Zhang Yimou's earlier films, but it is more heartfelt. It's less artsy so it can be enjoyed by almost anyone. Note: The Chinese and American versions of this film have different endings. I can't advise you on which one to see since they are practically equal in degree of happiness or sadness. I would say the difference between them is like the difference between the two separate endings of Dickens' Great Expectations.",1060128000,13,1152,5.005208333333333
1787071,4,B00006RCL3,"A middle aged bachelor, Zhao is desperately seeking love and thinks he has found it in a woman who wants a large wedding.  It appears that Zhao has promised more than what he can deliver to this woman, since he is rather poor.  However, he fabricates a story that he is a co-owner of a hotel, and in the process is asked to help her blind stepdaughter, Wu Ying, to get a job at the hotel.  As the story develops, the truth of Wu Ying is revealed, and it seems like Zhao is in over his head again.  Happy Times is a comic tragedy that shakes the audience with both laughs and sorrow.  The film offers a truly humane cinematic experience that will touch those who see this remarkable film.",1058227200,3,687,4.253846153846154
1787072,4,B00006RCL3,"Despite the upbeat title, 'Happy Times' depicts anything but...abuse by a stepmother, abandonment by a natural father, massive structural unemployment, a future of limited hope for each of the protagonists.
Through all of this despair, the natural goodness of Benshan Zhao's character (also called ""Zhao"") shines through.  His ruses get more complicated and difficult to sort out, but in the second-half of the film, his growing care and concern for ""Little Wu"" (skillfully portrayed by Dong Jie) is obvious.
I defy anyone to watch 'Happy Times' without tears streaming down your cheeks by the end.  I definitely recommend a rental/purchase, but you may want to pair it with something a bit more upbeat or comedic.  This is a heartbreaking movie.",1049068800,3,746,5.2
1787073,5,B00006RCL3,"Zhang Yimou is always at his best when he is portraying ordinary people facing overwhelming circumstances.  Although not an epic film, this movie joins the ranks of ""To Live"" and ""The Story of Qiu Jiu"" as yet another supreme example of that genre.
The story surrounds the efforts of a man in his fifties (Zhao) who is desperately trying to get a woman to marry him.  The woman, when we meet her, is obviously a caricature-morbidly obese, with an enormous slob of a son.  In this pathetic environment, the door opens on a frail, pretty young lady, who obviously doesn't fit the picture, and who, though blind, ""sees"" better than anyone else what is really important.  I was struck by the pathos of her blindness, as she plays it magnificently.  But I was even more fascinated with the ""blindness"" of Zhao, who can't see the forest for the giant Sequoia.
You know what?  Forget reviews-you just need to see this movie.  From the pathetic opening, to the elaborate ruse of a fake massage parlor that forms the bulk of the story, to the ""relationship"" that each of Zhao's retired friends forms with this young lady, to her noble response to the deception, which she discovers far before any of them suspect, to the incredible ending... Talking to a playing tape recorder...I never would have thought of it; it's really one of the most unusual endings I have seen.
When it comes right down to it, the whole movie is a caricature, because the storyline is so outlandish that you can never quite believe that something like that would actually happen.  Throughout the movie, my most consuming thought was, ""How in the sam hill is he going to end this thing?!""  Zhang Yimou did not disappoint me.  Zhao and the young girl are saying good bye to each other in a way which is tragic, because we know that neither of them can hear the other, and yet triumphant, because in some very real way, each of them has finally come to reality-the end of illusion.
Happy Times?  Hmmm....I'd have to think about it.  Yes, in a way, because throughout the whole time that this ""game"" is being played by Zhao and his friends, they really are being kind to the young girl.  And she is having more fun than she has ever had in her life.  Yet, the story is a tragedy, because none of the relationships are ever fulfilled.  This movie is perhaps the most apolitical movie Zhang Yimou has made, but it is rich with the themes that have made him the great director he is.  It is easily a movie for the whole family, and a movie that can be talked about, and talked about, and talked about long after it is over.",1047081600,5,2581,4.506437768240343
1787074,4,B00006RCL3,"Very common error among Western viewers about ""Happy Times"" is the idea that this film is a comedy, or ""basically comedy.""  And another mistake is to see this one as too light-weight, remembering the past works of the director Zhang Yimou, previously known for his collaboration with Gong Li (in ""Red Sorghum"" ""Ju Dou"" ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and others) and more recently for ""The Road Home"" starring beautiful Zhang Ziyi.  Yes, ""Happy Times"" is often very funny; and yes, it is short and simple.  But you should not miss the messages at the subliminal level.
The film stars a newcomer Dong Jie, formerly a student at a dance school in Beijing, as Wu Ying.  Wu Ying is a blind girl, adopted by the reluctant step-mother, and living at her house while being treated very badly.  Wu is just another trouble to the family, and she knows it.
Then, a middle-aged guy named Zhao steps in, as a possible husband to Wu's step-mother.  Zhao, unemployed, is so desperate to marry her (step-mother), so keeps on lying about his social background, claiming he can offer plenty of money at the marriage, and even promises to ""employ"" Wu as one of staff at his imaginary hotel.  Thus meet the two unlikely persons: a blind girl and a preposterously lying forty-something man.
We are to follow the relations between them; Zhao has to keep Wu ""employed"" even though she is a sulky girl, and the ""hotel"" exists no longer.  However, Zhao, not an unkind chap, comes to feel sympathy for her while the girl Wu begins to understand what is going on around her.
I should not reveal more about the story except that though the whole framework of the film is that of comedy, the underlcurrent feelings are very tragic one, as you see in Zhang Yimou's recent works ""Not One Less"" and ""The Road Home.""  The film unfolds its story very smoothly, thanks to the perfect performance of Zhao Benshan, to the bitter-sweet ending (more bitter than sweet, perhaps), and if you don't care for that kind of story, you will find another Zhang Ziyi in the strong acting of the heroine, of Dong Jie, who had to lose her weight by  nearly 10 kilometers to prepare for the audition.  Well, she looks natural, and is natural, but that's what you call good acting.
The most important thing might be that the director shrewdly inserts the shots and episodes that reflect the today's social conditions in China, the gaps between those who have, and have not.  Ads for items like icecream or cosmetics are abound in the city, but they are out of the reach of the two main characters.  But Yimou handles subtlely these matters, never letting them impede the film.
This is a simple tale, and might be too simple for some people.  (If you want a more dynamic film, wait to see his next epic film ""Hero"" starring again Zhang Ziyi.)  Still ""Happy Times"" offers vivid portrayal of two convincing characters and  heart-wrenching (but heart-warming) moments.  If you loved ""Not One Less"" or ""The Road Home,"" definitely it is yours.
The film is co-produced by Terrence Malick, director ""Thin Red Line.""",1042329600,11,3048,4.688555347091932
1787075,5,B00006RCL3,"There was a time when I longed to see another Zhang Yimou film. His greatest films, ""Raise the Red Lantern,"" ""Shanghai Triad,"" ""Ju-dou,"" and ""Red Sorghum"" are--without a doubt--some of the richest cinematic experiences--and I'll stress the word ""experiences"" that I've EVER had.

But something happened to Zhang Yimou, and his artistry--as perhaps one of the greatest directors of all time--waned. Was it perhaps because he lost his muse, Gong Li, star of ""Shanghai Triad"" and ""Raise the Red Lantern""? Many professional reviewers speculate that Gong Li's departure is the cause for Yimou's artistic slump, but regardless of the cause, Yimou seems to be on the rise again with this film ""Happy Times.""

Zhao (Bensahn Zhao), an unemployed, middle-aged lonely factory worker longs for a wife. After being jilted 18 times, he decides to marry an unpleasant, domineering divorcee. While friends scoff at photographs of Zhao's large new fiancee, Zhao defends her rubenesque proportions by stating that the other 18 women left him because they were skinny, and as this fiancee is far from skinny, Zhao believes she will stay put and marry him.

Zhao, in order to impress the divorcee, brags that as the manager of the ""Happy Times"" hotel, he is fairly well-to-do. Problems develop when the divorcee contends that they need 50,000 yen in order to get married in style, and this is when Zhao starts to involve his friends in his relationship. Acting on the advice of his best friend (who also has no money), Zhao refurbishes an abandoned bus as a romantic retreat for lovers with the idea that the lovers will pay for their privacy.

The divorcee, who really is a most unpleasant character, decides that the non-existent ""Happy Times"" hotel would be the perfect place to dump her unwanted blind step-daughter, Ying, and before Zhao realizes it, he is responsible for the neglected, frail blind teenage girl. Zhao's faulty logic, accompanied by his unrelenting desire to please and placate his nasty fiancee lead to further fabrications and eventually to disaster.

The title of the DVD, ""Happy Times,"" is ironic--just as the ""Happy Times"" hotel does not exist, there are also really no ""happy times"" for any of the characters in this film. Happiness remains elusive--or exists in the imagination, at best. Zhao's make-believe hotel--a metaphor for life--is really only a gutted, abandoned bus that serves as a tacky love nest. Similarly, happy times for Zhao and Ying are elusive and fleeting moments spent eating an ice cream, and describing the colours and patterns in a dress. There is no lasting happiness in reality, and yet indulging in fabrications and make-believe ultimately also brings unhappiness to those who indulge in fantasies--displacedhuman",1040169600,35,2748,5.138702460850112

He is arguably known as one of China's best movie directors.

Happy Times is a wonderful, humorous and moving story.  No it is not rolling on the floor funny, but it has very humorous and yet touching moments.

An aging factory worker Zhao set to marry an amply sized woman. His marriage intended has an overweight young son and an 18 year-old blind stepdaughter who is treated poorly at home.  Stepmother believes a deceiving story that Zhao owns a hotel and she insists upon dumping the girl on him to work.

It is here that deception occurs as Zhao and his retired mates attempt to recreate a room in an abandoned soon-to-be-destroyed warehouse.  In this room, Wu will give massages and be paid with fake money.  The deception continues and soon another twist changes the course of the path.

Some might feel this movie is not a comedy; but yes, it is certainly with its humorous moments.  It is saddened at times, and yet moving.  I see it as the varying effects of deception.  To his intended wife, Zhao deceives and this deception leads to more deception, to the 18 year-old blind girl.  One can't win though deception, but see what happens in this case.  The film is colorful and it takes place in the city with noisy traffic and people milling around.  ... Great classic film, moving story, wonderful acting.

1787082,4,B00006RCL3,"This is one of my favorite Zhang Yimou films.  There are rumors that Zhang has sold out, doing a government film for the Olympics, making martial arts films for Hollywood.  We'll see.  I think he has been one of the best people to tell the story of the common Chinese.  His earlier works (The Road Home, Not one Less, Judou, etc) tell of rural life.  This is about urban life.  What makes this movie great is that it doesn't use recognizable face people as actors.  Also, there are no special effects.  For me this made it easier to become very emotionally involved with the quirky story of some quirky people.  Sometimes it was hilarious, sometimes sad.  If you like typical Hollywood movies that have predictable endings, the usual villains, are preachy and pander to ""basic instincts"" such as sex and violence this probably isn't your cup of tea.  For me it was real and believable.

The one drawback I felt was that it doesn't really give a good feel for what a modern Chinese city is like.  I currently live in Guangzhou (Canton).  Although there is nothing especially false about the portrayal of a Chinese megalopolis I felt the flavor of life was missing.  The crowding is so great I often feel that most of the 20 million residents actually live in my building, making noise, throwing garbage around, smoking inconsiderately, and driving like  - well, as if only emperors owned cars and the lives of pedestrians were meaningless in the scheme of things. When so many people live in such close proximity things aren't the same as in the West.  In fairness that isn't what this movie is about, yet it is one of the main reasons I like Zhang's films; getting an idea of what Chinese life is like.

However, I really love his other films dealing with ordinary people in realistic settings. Among them, Happy Times is by far the best.

This movie's central theme is about one person lying to another to bring him/her joy and meaning in existence. It is the act of deception that somehow gets turned into a great expression of love. That is an amazing thing to capture.

The actors are just perfect, especially the two leads. The girl playing the blind actress made the best performance I've seen ever.

The movie does begin along the lines of what I expected-as Zhao creates his ""Happy Times Hotel""-and there is a bit of humor--but once he begins his relationship with Ying--the story progresses into a dramatic touching relationship between the two outcasts--young blind Ying and middle aged, never married Zhao. Their relationship is not a romantic one--but a paternal one-with Zhao writing a fake letter to Ying from her father who abandoned her--among other things.

The ending is not the happy, feel good ending typical of American movies--which is probably one of the things that makes it stand out.
