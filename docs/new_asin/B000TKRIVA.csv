8209963,1,B000TKRIVA,"I have over 70 bigfoot/sasquatch dvds & VHS and this is by far the worse. I've disagreed with some other poor reviews of products, but the previous review hit it. We start out with a segment that looks like the cheapest public access footage possible (a hint - don't let a non artistic person create your alien backdrop) and then the footage leading up to the interview (the interviewee is one of the reasons this phenomena doesn't get taken seriously) starts out with footage of them driving up a mountain where sightings have taken place. After a brief description where their heading, we get treated to 5 minutes of shaky footage that makes, ""The Blair With Project"" look like it was shot with a steeady cam. All that with NO DIALOGUE! That is exactly what an ""edit"" is for.

The DVD has plenty of claims, nothing to back any of it up (such as the ""portal"" to another dimention - between two trees in the wilderness.)

For completionists (like me) only. This will not convert or inspire anyone starting out researching this topic. Save your money.",1262304000,,1050,4.639784946236559
8209964,1,B000TKRIVA,"""On Bigfoot's Mountain"" is the worst DVD on the subject I've seen. And that is saying something in a field where most of the DVD's are mediocre at best.
From the opening scene against a cheap backdrop where the two hosts ""discuss"" the subject from the drive up this mountain to talk to some guy who had some ""strange"" experiences - This is the biggest waste of time and money and I'd avoid it.
It's awful.",1204761600,6,405,4.342105263157895
