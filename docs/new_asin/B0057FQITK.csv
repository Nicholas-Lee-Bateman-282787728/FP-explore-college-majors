About the Getty's: Keith & Kristyn Getty Irish singer/songwriters and recording artists Keith & Kristyn Getty are among the preeminent modern hymn composers of this generation. Best known for ""In Christ Alone"" (penned by Keith Getty and Stuart Townend), the world-renowned hymn has been recorded by numerous artists over the past decade--including Owl City, Natalie Grant and Newsboys--and is a classic sung in churches around the globe.

Writers of an acclaimed repertoire of 21st century hymns revered both for their theologically astute lyrics and universally beloved melodies, the couple's popular U.S. recordings include In Christ Alone, Awaken The Dawn and Joy - An Irish Christmas. Keith & Kristyn have shared their music at Franklin Graham crusades, the GMA Dove Awards, The Third Lausanne Conference on World Evangelization, as well as feature performances at London's Royal Albert Hall and the legendary Grand Ole Opry, among many other noted platforms.

Along with their band--an ensemble of some of the top names in Irish and American folk music--Keith & Kristyn have toured extensively in both America and the Celtic Islands this year. Additionally, their annual Joy - An Irish Christmas Tour, which included a sellout performance at Nashville's prestigious Schermerhorn Symphony Center in 2011, has become a highlight of the holiday season for audiences around the country and is slated to stop in 20 stateside cities later this year.

Hailing from Northern Ireland and now residing in Nashville, the couple welcomed their first child, Eliza Joy, last year.

My Thoughts About the DVD: If you enjoy a worshipful musical experience that exalts and glorifies God and His Son Jesus Christ and are not able to participate in such an experience live, you will surely enjoy watching and listening to the DVD, Keith & Kristyn Getty Live.

From the first song on the DVD, Hear, O Israel/Come People of the Risen King - (A musical call to worship God with a delightful and definite Jewish flavor to it) to the last, Hear All Creation; featuring Toss the Feathers, the DVD is pure musical worship from the Getty's. Every song on the DVD; each one distinct yet edifying and enjoyable to listen to in its music and message, will in some way cause you to pause, worship, praise and reflect on the person, power, grace, and goodness of God.

The graphics for the song Jesus Draw Me Ever Nearer are appealing to the senses and appropriate to the song being played in the background. The musical accompaniment to each song on the DVD is flawless and totally complementary to the vocals of Kristyn Getty. And in regards to her vocals, the vocals of Kristyn Getty are clear, strong and captivating as she gives all she has to sing praises to God. Also, the background vocals, supportive of Kristyn's powerful voice just add to the listening pleasure of the songs on the DVD. Of course my favorite song on the DVD, though I enjoyed listening to them all, is one that is recognized worldwide as a song written by Stuart Townend and Keith Getty and performed by the Getty's and countless Christian artists and in church services all over the world, and that is In Christ Alone. It is a song that will lift your heart in worship to the Lord and cause you to want to sing along with Kristyn, ""In Christ alone my hope is found, He is my light, my strength, my song..."" It is the last song on the DVD before the final 2 enjoyable bonus tracks; Jesus Draw Me Ever Nearer and Hear All Creation featuring the Irish folk song Toss the Feathers.

If you enjoy worship music and the music of the Getty's then their live DVD is sure to be a blessing to you and to whoever watches it with you.

Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of The DVD Keith & Kristyn Getty Live from Getty Music for reviewing it. I was not required to write a favorable review for receiving the DVD.",1362009600,,4843,4.82289156626506
8460635,5,B0057FQITK,"I didn't become a Getty fan until about two years ago. I was already a fan of several other Christan artists from Ireland, like Robin Mark and Kathryn Scott, but somehow I had missed out on the Gettys. However, I'm catching up now. I'd love for the chance to see the Gettys live, but it doesn't look like they are coming to California anytime soon (why do many Christian artists have a fear of going further west than the Rockies? Oh, well, guess I shouldn't complain, Lincoln Brewster lives practically in my backyard.) But this live DVD is the next best thing. It's nice to hear the Gettys perform on CDs, but it's twice as good to watch them perform live. I really enjoy watching Kristyn sing, no, not just because she is pretty, but because of her genuine smile that results from the joy of knowing her Lord. It's not a practiced smile, it's spontaneous and sincere. No histrionics required (although it's funny, by comparison Kim Walker-Smith of Jesus Culture has a lot of histrionics when she sings, yet those also seem spontaneous and sincere to me. God just uses each of these women in a different way.)

I thought the best cuts on the DVD were the ones towards the beginning, the highlight being Stuart Townend's ""The Power Of The Cross"" (co-written with the Gettys). ""By Faith"" is not far behind, as well as ""Come People Of The Risen King"" and ""When Trials Come"", an upbeat hymn with a march rhythm (after a tender opening).

My only disappointment is that there weren't more shots of the audience. In fact, the audience was pretty subdued. I have a number of Hillsong DVDs, and those include lots and lots of shots of the audience. Call me a voyeur, but I love to see those shots of people unabashedly worshiping God. For me it really helps bring the message home.

As far as audio quality, the live performance was every bit as good as a studio performance. Video quality was outstanding, too.",1329004800,8,1905,4.580645161290323
8460636,5,B0057FQITK,I found this video to be encouraging and edifying.  The words and music are such that I want them part of my worship experience weekly.  They deal with the sovereignty of God and the need of man scripturely. What a glorious experience!,1325289600,5,235,4.571428571428571
8460637,5,B0057FQITK,"I have seen and heard Keith and Kristyn for many years. They are unique in their music composition and singing style. Our church has adopted many many of their songs and incorporated them into our worship services. To me, they are absolutely the BEST! I don't understand why they are not more popular nationally. Can't wait for their Christmas CD.",1315958400,13,347,4.8
