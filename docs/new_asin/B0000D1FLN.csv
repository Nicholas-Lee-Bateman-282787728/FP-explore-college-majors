8000339,1,B0000D1FLN,the merchant was very good and proactive in giving me a prompt refine and credit for this particular DVD it really should not be sold it is very blurry um poor contrast poor quality oz subpar VHS quality and it jumps in skips often even though there were no scratches on it and it was brand new repeat this should not be sold for a profit,1380326400,,338,4.136363636363637
8000340,3,B0000D1FLN,"I agree with what else has been written here except for the comment that the Kultur Video (different cover picture, same performance, from 1978 like this one) is to be preferred to this one.  They're both awful in terms of audio and video quality.  I've written a longer review under the Kultur Video release description.

In a nutshell, the Kultur Video release is terribly DARK and the sound quality thin and distant.  Very little additional effort when into reworking that original here.

To address the darkness they ramped up the brightness which -- to quote the Geico commercial on tv -- is so easy, a caveman could do it.  Well, they did it, and it does at least make it possible to see what's going on, so that's a plus.

On the other hand, they made the sound quality even worse.  They took the thin, distant original sound and smothered it with Dolby which makes it worse.  And yes there are frequent dropouts in sound which is annoying and inexpllcable since they're not on the Kultur release.  So they made the sound even worse! (not easy to do considering the original).

Still, the fact that you can see more of what's going on makes this release preferable to the Kultur video release.  Both are lousy for audio and video but the performance remains special, for me anyway.  My review of the performance (and more audio/video carping) can found under the Kultur video release with the title ""A Flawed Nutcracker for and by Adults"" or something like that :-)

One last thing to consider.  At $5 or less I still consider these DVDs (don't buy the VHS by mistake) a bargain... IF ...you can look and listen past the lousy audio & video,  though i wouldn't blame those who simply can't.",1222300800,,1697,4.6066666666666665
8000341,2,B0000D1FLN,This performance is so badly filmed that it's hard to enjoy the dancing.  The level of sophistication is actually close to what one would expect from a couple of cameras at a High School performance.  My goal is to find a performance of the Nutcracker with a little more thought gone into its production.,1156377600,,304,4.611111111111111
8000342,1,B0000D1FLN,"I agree that this is a dismal DVD. The original filming is much of the problem, with the performance either not properly staged for film or the director having no idea how to capture ballet. Much of the time the feet of the performers are lopped off, and the overall effect is claustrophobic. Whatever was done to (supposedly) make this 5.1 Dolby wasn't beneficial. Oddly, quite frequently there is a silent momentary hiccup in the disc.",1093737600,8,437,4.7631578947368425
