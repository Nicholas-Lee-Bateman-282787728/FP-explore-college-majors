8021891,3,B0002450BS,"Most of these cartoons have been issued before in the original 8 tape release of George of the Jungle. Unfortunately, this time it is only George.  The better cartoons, Super Chicken & Tom Slick have not been included.  I would suggest getting the original 8, the asking prices of the used copies reflects the popularity of those over these.

THE GOOD NEWS: This tape is recorded in the SP quality mode!

Tape includes:
""Gold Mine,"" (aka Treasure of Sarah Madre from Vol. 3)
""Dr. Scrupritzer,""
""Mr. Noodnick,"" (aka Kings Back to Back)
""Ring-a-Ding Circus."" (aka Big Flop at the Big Top from Vol. 7)",1147478400,,598,4.721153846153846
