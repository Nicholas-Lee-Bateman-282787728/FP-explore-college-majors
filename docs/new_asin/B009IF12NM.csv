8541811,5,B009IF12NM,"I purchased this specifically for Tristan and Isolde, which is an incredible production!!  Nina is fantastic !!!  The other productions are not bad, but the Ring was a little bit of a let down.  The orchestra is messy and the singing is sometimes hard to take.  But overall, this set is a great value, and a good addition to any Wagner collection.",1378166400,9,347,4.548387096774194
