I would honestly not recommend this product for someone wanting to watch an actual Bayonetta anime, because this is not what the product actually is. However, if you are a fan of the game, go for it. My only complaint is that it's not worth the price it costs, and I've found several sites where I could have gotten it for a much more reasonable price. I will say, though, that I bought it from this seller because of his assurance that if it didn't work in my dvd player, he'd let me return it.",1308960000,5,741,4.110344827586207
