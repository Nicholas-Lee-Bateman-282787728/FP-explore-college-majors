7961885,4,B00006678O,Bought it for Sean Murray and his performance was top notch but he wasn't in the whole movie and I found that disappointing but all and all liked it.,1417392000,,149,4.172413793103448
7961886,5,B00006678O,"I've become a Sean Murray fan since his appearance in NCIS. So I wanted to watch other movies having him in the cast.
A pity Spring Break Lawyer isn't available on DVD (had to get the VHS player from the attic to be able to watch)...
Granted, it's a bit of a bawdy sort of movie, and therefore, I hope Spring Break in the US is not as bad as it is shown in this movie.
Here, I couldn't help but be reminded of a Hieronymus Bosch painting, but in this case depicting all sorts of juvenile pranks possible.
Nice, for an MTV comedy. I'm glad I saw it and it made me laugh.",1290470400,,569,4.0
7961887,5,B00006678O,"It was very funny. I'm a fan of Sean Murray and wanted to see this movie. I would have preferred a DVD copy, but as long as I could see it, it's okay. There were some, okay a lot, of raunchy parts,but it IS an MTV movie, so that's to be expected. I thought Sean was SO cute and funny. I loved the scene where his character is arrested for solicitation of a prostitute. Any scene he is in is my favorite. I definitely recommend it! If there is ever a DVD available I will get it.",1252281600,3,478,3.9381443298969074
