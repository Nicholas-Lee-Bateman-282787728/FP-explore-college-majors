8103748,4,B000E15K3W,"I really liked this video.  I've visited Yosemite and this video gave me a better appreciation for what I had seen and done at Yosemite.

The film tended to drag a bit at the end.  A definite recommendation !!",1392076800,,209,4.3076923076923075

8103750,5,B000E15K3W,"Whether you did some rock climbing in your life (as I did, in Yosemite), or are just curious and amazed by the popularity of this sport, this is the documentary to have, to re-watch, and to share with others.  The archival footage is fantastic, as are the interviews.  Of course, it is only focused on Yosemite, but that is where the sport really bloomed (as alpinism bloomed in Europe's Alps).",1385424000,,394,4.614285714285714
8103751,5,B000E15K3W,"Whether you're a climber, outdoor enthusiast, or just enjoy nature this is a thoroughly entertaining docu. Amidst the true majesty of Yosemite is a great story of men and women breaking the bonds of gravity. As the sport of climbing is changing so is the American culture surrounding these climbers. The photography is breath taking, the story poignant, the message inspirational. You will watch this more than once. Worth your time and money! MJM",1320364800,2,447,5.054054054054054
