8610649,5,B00EZ5VFAA,"This dvd came from the UK. Being from the states you cannot watch it even with an open coded blu ray player. Keeping it as a keep sake regardless as a collectible. Huge fan of the show and after finally being able to see the episode, this one is well worth it.",1424131200,,260,4.019230769230769
8610650,3,B00EZ5VFAA,"OK right from the get go can it just be said how pitiable it is to watch people give one star reviews to products they didn't watch because they didn't realise it wouldn't play on their machine or who read the region blurb but put the product in their shopping cart anyway. Heavens to Betsy.....

Anyway to the review of the product at hand. Which by the by is a solid entry into the legion of 'bonus' products put together by the Top Gear team (in this case we have the duo of Hammond and Clarkson). This sees our chaps drive through some lovely European scenery changing cars seeming as often as they change their underwear as they try to dissect exactly what cars are best suited to what styles of driving, roads or even social occasions. It's all done with tongue in cheek although Clarkson probably does have the money to buy a different car for every mood and there is plenty of the famous rapport between the presenters.

That's about it, beautiful cars, beautiful locations and a couple of familiar faces in the drivers seats.",1398297600,4,1034,4.524064171122995
8610651,1,B00EZ5VFAA,there was no mention that this was not the correct format for USA viewing and now it is very difficult to return this information should be up front,1397260800,,148,4.321428571428571
8610652,1,B00EZ5VFAA,"Note: The title of this review is just informational.  The one star is not because this disc is Region B only.  It was purchased by my son, a big fan of BBC's Top Gear, who was not aware of the region formatting of these discs. That's on us, though.

My true issue lies with attempting to redeem the digital copy that comes with this disc.  It's provided by Ultra Violet and offers a redemption code and fairly simple instructions for what to do.

The problem is that the redemption code did not work, providing a nebulous error code that was nowhere to be found in their FAQs or help section.  A web search on this code offered nothing more than other customers confused by its meaning.

I contacted UV customer service about this.  They were quick to respond, but ultimately unhelpful as their advice consisted of telling me multiple times to just try again. Needless to say this was a fruitless effort.

After a few days of this they threw up their arms in frustration and passed me over to Flixster customer support - the company hosting the video.  Their support were much slower to get back to me.  After some days, I finally received a response that they were passing me over to BBC customer support as they likewise had no idea what the issue was.

BBC customer support was even slower to get back to me. After offering them all of the information to prove this was a legitimate purchase they replied that the back of the Blu-Ray clearly stated this was a UK only product.  This was a flat out lie, which I called them on.  No such clear warning exists on this packaging.  I explained the situation and said that all I wanted was to redeem the digital copy so my son could watch this, one of his favorite shows.

Finally, another several days later, they replied again - changing their tune and instead pointing to some very small fine print on the back that claims the digital copy might not work on all machines. That's their ""clear"" message. Following that, they refused to budge on helping further.

Multiple weeks wasted trying to go through the proper channels for nothing.  All of this could have been avoided had their online site simply stated ""Redemption code invalid for this country"" or if UV customer service could have just said that upfront.

If you live outside of Region B, avoid this purchase.  More importantly avoid going through the digital vendor's customer service.  The hassle is not worth it.",1397001600,5,2425,4.593023255813954
8610653,1,B00EZ5VFAA,"When I was looking for copies of this to buy I noticed that other out of the US sellers had noted that this won't play in the US. I found a US dealer and looking through, I saw nothing that said the thing wouldn't play on a blu-ray player. It turns out I didn't look hard enough, and this blu-ray is a region 2....buyers beware.",1394928000,2,328,4.061538461538461
8610654,5,B00EZ5VFAA,My Son has a strong connection with all things Top Gear.  The DVD was shipped well ahead of schedule and it is a big hit.,1393804800,2,121,3.84
8610655,5,B00EZ5VFAA,"Much needed shot of entertainment before TG comes back. Filled with your usual Clarkson stuff and thankfully no James May. Don't listen to that hater reviewer who hates everything about cars and probably drives a Prius or a Civic Hybrid. Only disappointment is that it was a bit short. And no guest stars, which is good.",1387324800,8,320,4.732142857142857
8610656,1,B00EZ5VFAA,Clarkson has taken up preaching about how he hates America. America has only made him the richest oaf on television. Maybe he has read to much literature on Che and the Cuban revolution. Maybe he has simply found the cochhold of production assistants in which he is surrounded will like him more. Why pass any dollars his way? Let him get by on hryvna and kyat.,1386374400,5,361,4.484848484848484
