4578041,1,B0055HK7DI,"I was very disappointed in this latest Scooby Doo movie.  They had Shaggy turning into a tough guy and using terms like ""kicking butt"" so I thought it totally inappropriate for younger children.  They also had brawls and motorcycle gang fights, etc.  I grew up on Scooby Doo and love how clean and fun the cartoon was and this was definitely not that.  I was very disappointed that writers are taking characters that work well together to solve a mystery with clean language, fun spooks, and great 'monsters', and turning them into the usual Hollywood mess that is out there now.  I do NOT recommend this latest Scooby Doo movie, stick with the Loch Ness mystery or the Pirates Ahoy, or Camp Scare for the usual fun mystery solving.",1318032000,9,732,4.6434108527131785
4578042,4,B0055HK7DI,"It's  another Scooby movie.  However they must be doing something right, as my son has had 3 Scooby bday parties in a row.  He loves it.  I'm sure this movie will be worn out in no time.  My 2nd son is now enjoying the movies.",1317945600,,226,3.933333333333333
4578043,4,B0055HK7DI,"I've been waiting years to find the classic Scooby, the Scooby from way back in the Where Are You days? I enjoy almost anything to do with Scooby and the gang but some outings are more enjoyable or true to that original doo I grew up on (through saturday morning reruns).

This film felt more like an extended episode of one of the more recent series (What's New or Mystery Inc.). Another reviewer said it right when they noted that the mystery has lately been taking a back seat to other more cliche storypoints. I enjoyed it at first when the films threw in a bit of romance between Freddy and Daphne but now it seems every film one of the gang has a new crush or someone who has a crush on them and it is always stereotypical and goes nowhere. They also toss in more action/adventure to pad the stories to film length, such as a motorcycle chase in this film. On top of that the Mystery has to have several false endings to try and join several ideas together to reach the proper running time.

For me the straight to video releases always made sense when they were marketed for a more mature scooby audience, some will disagree. Zombie Island, Witches Ghost and Alien Invaders were great and enjoyable for most younger viewers and older fans in my opinion, honoring the original series while updating and bringing it to the modern age. They also focused strongly on the mystery aspect with sleuthing being center stage. Kids have the constantly reformatting television series so it would be nice if they tried to use these films for the older audience in terms of quality.

This video is okay and I'm happy to own it but it feels like a step down from the previous entry. Some parents didn't like Camp Scare but I enjoyed the more atmospheric return to the dark and creepy Scooby days. I felt the mystery took a back seat in that entry as well but overlooked it because the atmosphere and story unfolded quite naturally and I thought the films were moving in the right direction. Here I see they have little interest in creating a continuity or ongoing character developments in this latest line of films. At any rate Scooby fans will be happy but this is a rent for most fans and only a buy for purists like myself or parents wanting to entertain the kiddies.

I also wish WB would include some featurettes or something on these releases, even short ones like on Zombie Island or Witches Ghost releases. To end on a positive note, I am a Scooby fan, Matthew Lillard has been doing an excellent job stepping into the role of Shaggy now that Casey Kasem has moved on. The animation has been crisp and clean in these newest films and they look great in high definition. I also appreciate the throughback to the old character designs, very well done.

I hope the next release has less goofiness and more mystery with built in comedy. I'll keep positive about those special features showing up again one day too.",1316390400,6,2912,4.507575757575758
4578044,2,B0055HK7DI,"I'll be surprised if I don't get a few angry responses to this review, being familiar with the Scooby fan community as I have been for years, but frankly, I found this movie pretty disappointing, much as most Scooby Doo offerings the last few years have been.  There's an old adage, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  So I wonder why they keep trying to ""fix"" Scooby Doo?

First off, the good points of this movie: good voice acting, the animation is top notch (of the style used in ""Zombie Island"" and its follow ups) and while the formula is more akin to the live-action films in that it's more about action/comedy/romance than actual mystery, it is well-paced.  And...that's about it.

This isn't true Scooby Doo, the original I grew up with and have always loved and which never needed fixing.  The mystery takes a back seat to action sequences (a motorcyle race that has nothing to actually do with the mystery), romance (for some reason Scooby writers seem determined to throw this in, when it's never been needed and always ends the same way) and very little actual clue searching or mystery solving.  Little kids will probably love it, and fans of the ""new"" style of Scooby Doo will as well; but old-school folks, you're best off avoiding this and watching ""The Monster of Mexico"", which was by far the best of the direct-to-video releases in that it actually attempted to resurrect not just the old school formula, but used the same looks, animation and even the voices!  ""Phantosaur"" is a pale comparison to that one.

Also, be warned if you don't have Blu-Ray, you're going to have to jump through some minor but irritating hoops to watch this, as the digital copy has to install and download the content.  This also means you won't be able to re-sell it (in fact, the included agreement bars it) if you've already viewed it, at least not the digital copy DVD.  Frankly you're better off just streaming this direct from Amazon VOD in that case.",1315612800,5,1956,4.6405797101449275
4578045,5,B0055HK7DI,"Scooby Doo: Legend of the Phantosaur has Scoob and the gang going on a relaxing spa getaway when they discover the Phantosaur. A dinosaur come to life to protect buried treasures deep within secret caves below. During this time, Shaggy finds his inner hero after being put under hypnosis...thing is, it puts him and the gang into some awkward circumstances. And that's where the fun begins.

This time around, folks, this original movie(the sixteenth, I believe) I didn't buy. Instead, it was purchased and given to me as a surprise cause they know I love Scoob and the gang so much.

After giving it a watch, all I can say is ""Sweeeeeeet!!""...this has to be in my top five of favorite Scoob direct-to-DVD original movies. I do believe those at WB are really starting to get things right with why fans love Scoob so much because the stories just keep getting better and better. Gone are the days of, easily, figuring out the mystery at hand. Anymore, you really have to look for clues in the story along with the gang...and I really like that(Speaking of which, check out Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated if you get the chance-it rocks!).

I love it!",1315526400,17,1149,4.678217821782178
4578046,5,B0055HK7DI,"Who doesn't love Scooby Doo?  This is one thing that my teenage daughter and I have in common.  She watches so many shows that are reality based, it's nice to have one that just makes us both laugh out loud.  This is a good movie, a new one I think?  She loaded it onto her mac and now has it on ipod for plane or car trips.  It's so nice that they included the digital copy because they are not only expensive to buy online, I get tired of lugging the laptop around us when we travel.  The fact that this loads right to iPod is a real treat.
We'll be buying more in this format.  Please keep it up WB!",1314921600,,602,3.925619834710744

4578048,4,B0055HK7DI,"I so look forward to the annual new Scooby Doo movie and yet again I was not disappointed.  I'm 36 years old and I still enjoy Scooby Doo (although I really dislike the new Mystery Inc series and not very thrilled with the live action versions).  This is classic Scooby with twists and turns of unexpected revelations.  I love how the stories now make you think it's over but there is still more to enjoy.  I've been waiting for sometime to watch this and didn't realize it was availablle to rent.  I can't wait until it comes out on dvd.  I have every one of these SD movies and I can't wait to add this one.  I'd like the writers to go back to the spin of real ghosts being part of the scam like in Witch's Ghost and Zombie Island.  I found that making the difference between the tv shows and the movies.  But the stories have always been fun no matter what.  Just like other SD movies, you have to like silliness and the ridiculous otherwise it's just not for you.  You can't take SD seriously and Phantosaur is no different.

I rented this via Amazon online and the picture was fantastic, like watching it on tv/dvd.  Amazon was $1 cheaper then renting through cable. Yeah tv would have been more comfortable to watch but I was very satisfied with the quality and process (this was my first Amazon rental).

Spoiler Alert - more specific details about the movie
  Velma finds a love interest, Shaggy finds courage and another Blake goofy relative.  The gang takes a spa vacation to help Shaggy relax and of course mysteries follow Mystery Inc.  With an archeological dig, you can already sense the trouble ahead.  But there isn't just one mystery in this tale.  After solving the first dinosaur problem, just as the gang says, ""that was too easy"".  There is yet another mystery and story to deal with.  And as usual, there is no real villian - the bad guys aren't that bad.",1313884800,12,1877,4.442815249266862

Daphne suggests a stay at a spa.  Not only will the spa be relaxing, but Fred can salvage his grade in science class by participating at a nearby archaeological dig.  Of course, nothing goes as planned for the gang in the Mustard Machine (which is what Fred renamed the Mystery Machine in an effort to avoid the scary mystery theme for Shaggys sake).  Not long after they arrive, the dig and spa town are terrorized by a phantom dinosaur.  With Shaggys nervous condition to deal with (made more unpredictable after his attempt to conquer it through hypnosis) and Freds science grade on the line, the gang plunges into another mystery.  Add in a wild motorcycle gang and a possible soul mate for Velma, and they're in for a much more exciting time than they bargained for!

While its not my favorite movie in the Scooby-Doo series, its still a lot of fun.  I especially enjoyed Shaggys on-again/off-again courage following his attempt to become braver through hypnosis.",1409616000,,1207,4.853658536585366

There is an element to the plot that allows Shaggy to have some amazing, fearless adventures unlike anything you would expect from him.  There is enough danger and dinosaurs that my boys (6 and 4) absolutely love it.

The overall message of this movie is positive.  There are elements of believing in yourself (as with pretty much every movie ever made it would seem), friendship, bravery, etc.  There aren't really any important life lessons to be learned from this movie but it is entertaining and worth watching.

The story line is good and there are a lot of funny things for kids and adults.  My four year old loves this too.  There is also a cool extra about going to the museum with the actor that plays the young Shaggy on the TV movies.  I highly recommend this one.,1320451200,4,362,3.986111111111111
4578201,1,B0055HK7DI,"These Scooby movies keep getting worse. In this latest ""cartoon"", Shaggy gets into a bar room brawl with a group of motorcycle thugs. One of them even whips out a knife. This is definitely NOT the type of easy going Scooby fare that we enjoyed as younger people. I was rooting for the villains by the time this was 45 minutes in. I'm glad somebody is still trying to keep Scooby and the gang alive; but why can't they keep the stories in the same vein as the originals?",1320019200,7,469,4.280898876404494

4578203,2,B0055HK7DI,"I love Scooby Doo, but I found this 16th movie terrible and even agonizing to sit through. I thought (# 1) ""Zombie Island"" was great. (# 2) ""Witch's Ghost"" was really good. (# 3) ""Alien Invasion"" had some great moments. I didn't much like (# 4) ""Cyber Chase."" (# 5) ""Legend of the Vampire"" was great. (# 6) ""Monster of Mexico"" had its moments. (# 7) ""Loch Ness"" was good in a different way. (# 8) ""Aloha"" had its moments. (# 9) ""Where's My Mummy"" was pretty good. (# 10) ""Pirates Ahoy"" was one of my favorites. I didn't much like (# 11) ""Chill Out."" I thought (# 12) ""Goblin King"" was phenomenal. I didn't much like (# 13) ""Samurai Sword."" (# 14) ""Abracadabra Doo"" was decent. And (# 15) ""Camp Scare was actually quite good.

This 16th film ""Phantosaur"" seems to have been written with simply the intention of getting another Scooby film out. (One a year?) While other films like ""Zombie Island,"" ""Pirates Ahoy"" and ""Camp Scare"" seem to be well written stories, this 16th film seems to be a bunch of cheap jokes strung together. Shaggy gets into a fight with a motorcycle gang, and this really has nothing important to do with the story.

Granted, this is a cartoon and not Shakespeare. But every art has its flow and its rules. And this movie seems to destroy everything that makes Scooby Doo so child friendly, but yet interesting and suspenseful even on an adult level.

Believe me. I love Scooby and it's really painful for me to write such a harsh review here. But just compare this 16th film to a classic episdoe like ""Scooby Doo and a Mummy Too,"" or even the most recent film ""Camp Scare."" It's almost like ""Phantosaur"" is making fun of Scooby Doo.

Probably the most annoying thing in this film is how they exaggerate Shaggy to such an annoying degree. Shaggy swings between an annoying Coward and an ego maniac daredevil in this film through hypnotism. Well, this is absurd. Contrary to popular belief, Shaggy is NOT A COWARD. BUT RATHER, HE NEEDS A REASON TO FIGHT OR FACE DANGER. Just look at ""Camp Nightmare."" He runs from danger when possible. But when Scooby is being attacked, all of a sudden Shaggy shows bravery: ""Hey fishface! Get away from my buddy!""

Maybe some of you will like this film. But BE WARNED. I have loved Scooby Doo all my life from the 1st episode ""What a Night For a Knight."" I loved ""Boo Brothers"" and ""The Reluctant Werewolf."" And I liked most of the material from ""Zombie Island"" to ""Camp Scare.""

But I found this 16th movie painful to sit through.  BORROW BEFORE YOU BUY!",1318464000,4,2511,4.5054945054945055
