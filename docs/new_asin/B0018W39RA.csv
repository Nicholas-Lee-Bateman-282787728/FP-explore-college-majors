8271274,4,B0018W39RA,"This movie is a good underground horror film. I know the people that worked on this film. The product info is wrong. This DVD is REGION 1 or Multi-Region because I own a copy of it, and never had a problem playing it in my computer or a set top DVD player.

The special effects are good for the budget that they had to work with. Some amazing stuff if you didn't know who George Lucas or Steven Spielberg were.

The twist and special effect make this movie great for any horror fan.

I would recommend this film to any B-Movie horror fan",1354752000,,537,4.194174757281553
8271275,5,B0018W39RA,"This is a really good movie with great effects and a nice twist ending. It was filmed in my hometown of Fort Wayne, IN in an old movie theatre. I would strongly suggest this movie if your a fan of gore and laughs. Trust me you won't regret it!",1248566400,,243,3.979591836734694
