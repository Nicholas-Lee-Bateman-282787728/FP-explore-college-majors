8346582,1,B001VLFEAI,Not a movie for children...Very violent and aggressive characters who are aggressive to children and animals...not a good movie for children,1383350400,2,140,5.714285714285714
8346583,4,B001VLFEAI,"I remember watching this as a child and loving it. So when I saw it here, I had to get it and it was good.  A child will like and so will adults who remember seeing it as a child.  Now if you think it's totally based upon the book, it isn't, only a few parts are.

Other than that it's nice and all the horses are happy.",1292976000,2,320,3.676470588235294
8346584,5,B001VLFEAI,"I had the video when I was a kid and a few years ago, I found it at Wal-Mart along with ""The Wind and the Willows"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" done by the same company and I grew up with those as well.

Anyways, this version was beautifully done. I've read some of the book and seen another adaption by Hanna-Barbera which was more faithful to the book, to my surprise it's actually a rather depressing story about the biography of a horse. Almost like ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" only not as action-y and fun also set in 19th century England instead of the American West.
But this adaption is working through it, giving it not only an entertaining plot about courage and loyalty but also a colorful cast of supporting characters and a dork of a main antagonist also a nasty supporting villain.
I positively recommend this adaption to anyone who loves horses and knows or doesn't know the story of ""Black Beauty"".",1292716800,3,918,4.5636363636363635
