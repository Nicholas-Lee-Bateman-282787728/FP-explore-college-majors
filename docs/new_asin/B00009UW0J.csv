1890468,3,B00009UW0J,The disks were miss labled. Only the first movie was any good the two sequals were awful. $35 is a rip for only one good movie.,1248048000,2,127,3.923076923076923
1890469,3,B00009UW0J,"The Cheerleaders Set is worthwhile to anyone a fan of cheerleaders.  The first movie is clearly the best in the bunch.  It's perfect, well not perfect but so entertaining and a good film to watch.

The other two are missing evrything that the first had, except it up the ante to a lesser degree and make a fool of themselves.  It gets a recommedation only for the first movie.",1189123200,3,376,4.405797101449275
1890470,3,B00009UW0J,i really enjoyed the first movie.the cheerleaders..the other two barely kept my eyes open..i don't see how they should be sold as a set..clearly the first is worth the price of all three..i would still recommend buying them all jus because of the nostalgia of a bygone era,1187222400,2,272,4.6875

1890472,2,B00009UW0J,The first one was okay.  Sexy and retro.  The other two were a waste of time and money.  Buy The Cheerleaders separately.  The revenge and swinging are edited so much they are a rip off.,1182124800,2,186,4.228571428571429
1890473,5,B00009UW0J,"This collection must have the highest proportion of skin to runtime I've seen from a skinflick (with a decent plot), especially the first one. Listen to the commentary for a wild description of how these young women were cast. For the price, this set is a real bargain.",1166832000,15,269,4.625
1890474,5,B00009UW0J,I was born in the 80's but I've seen this movie. The Original anyway and all I can say is that they just don't make movies like The Cheerleaders anymore.,1146441600,8,153,4.133333333333334
1890475,4,B00009UW0J,"I enjoyed the first movie in the series as it had the most of what I wanted in this type of movie. Fun nude action.

The second movie is fun due to David Hasselhoff dancing round like a gooba, but it seems more like a musical than anything else.

The third isn't really worth watching. I watched it a week ago and can't remember anything worth mentioning about it.

Still the first movie makes up for the rest...if I'm being generous!",1142985600,5,434,4.333333333333333

1890477,4,B00009UW0J,i only saw the cheerleaders and it was pretty good for a soft porn flick.,1068336000,5,73,3.933333333333333

1890479,5,B00009UW0J,"I went to see this movie while I was in college with buddies back in 1973.  For that time and our age it was a hot movie.  I purchased it mainly for the nostalgia and to go back in time to remember my college days.  The movie is cheesy of course and corny funny.  The girls would not be considered beautiful today but that is also part of the charm...they looked like real girls you saw around campus every day.  Don't expect great cinema or production values because you will not find it.  The best part for me was watching it the second time with the commentary from the producer.  Lots of background information that was interesting.  If you saw this in the movie theater back in the early 70's, pick it up and take a walk down memory lane and laugh a bit.",1451174400,5,759,4.222222222222222
1890480,4,B00009UW0J,"This is a seminal teen sex comedy flik from the early 70's that sorta sets the standard for the genre.  The copy that I purchased was from Amazon. UK  (Arrow Video) and it also included a copy of the sequel: ""Revenge of the Cheerleaders"" (which wasn't quite as good as the 'original') and a nice little booklet of background info by 'Cinema Sewer' author Robin Boughie.

""The Cheerleaders"" is a bare bones effort in terms of budget and production values but what it lacks in Hollywood glitz it more than makes up for in terms of fun and sex-ploitational  savvy!  The girls who form the titular cheer team are all really cute in a 'girl next door' kinda way and they exhibit a morality (or lack there-of) and readiness to shed their cheerleader suits and 'take-one-for-the-team"" that I'm sure most high-school guys dreamed about.  This film is literally awash in 'teen' nudity that goes well beyond the usual 'gym-shower' scenes and the light-hearted attitude towards sex that all the girlz effuse make this a particularly fun watch.  I found myself actually laughing out loud at some of the goofy antics on screen - especially the scenes where the two exhausted football teams are only capable of crawling around on the field after having been screwed into oblivion by the spirited cheer squad.  While there is a goodly helping of full female nudity - the flik is 'R' rated and all the home-coming humping is simulated fare. Apparently ""The Cheerleaders"" got the imaginations of porn producers churning and the film is credited with 'inspiring' the popular XXX hardcore knock-off:  ""Debbie Does Dallas"" - wherein similar cheerleader antics become much more explicit.

Despite the lack of hard-core action - ""The Cheerleaders"" is great sexy fun and a recommended viewing experience for horny teenagers of ALL ages!  Super clear widescreen picture with some nice extras.",1449100800,6,1868,4.955128205128205

7993041,4,B00009UW0J,"I was fortunate to have seen the original X-rated version of this movie when it first came out (with my wife). Maybe the audience was all stoned but I remember a packed house and roaring laughter all the way through. I think only a few seconds of the sex scenes were cut out so this R-rated version still has most of the humor of the original (the original theater version had a lot of laughs during the sex scenes).
When I bought the R-rated laser disc I was disappointed that it had been tampered with (to get the R) and then more recently I got the DVD version that has even more footage cut out. Most of the changes to the DVD version are in the first few minutes but unfortunately these changes do spoil the fun. The rest of the movie still has a lot of humor, but it is definitely toned down.",1468713600,4,798,4.188311688311688
