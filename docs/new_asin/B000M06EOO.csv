8165437,2,B000M06EOO,"to be polite, and it is hard to do with this movie. The name of the movie should be used for the audience, that is watching it. You want to watch to see if it gets better, well, let me tell you now, ""NO"". The story line was somewhat fair, the acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous and the events as they unfold, make no sense at all. What the lesbian scenes were about made no sense, if they showed more action in them, maybe, it could receive another point, Nick T. should give up acting, if that is what he wants to call it, the Director, should watch the movie and burn it,and I don't mean on a dvd, to save face. I think it was done as amateur week entries. Forget it and save your money and time.",1197590400,6,708,4.028368794326241
