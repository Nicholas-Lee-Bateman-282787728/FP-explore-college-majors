5705646,5,1939714087,"Whether you are managing a big workforce, or are self-employed, Fully Charged is a MUST SEE! Once you've watched it, it seems obvious - of course there is an essential synchronicity between nutrition, rest, exercise and emotional well-being - but when chasing high productivity, it's easy to forget. Director David Martin brings the elements of Tom Rath's book together in a truly masterful and inspiring way. Take the time to watch Fully Charged and you and your staff will be better for it.",1452297600,,492,4.9397590361445785
5705647,5,1939714087,"I usually watch medically themed shows expecting the worst.  I was very happy to find that there were none if the inaccuracies that I have come to expect from shows on health.  Nor was there the usual grandstanding by entertainers masquerading as journalists.  The show covered a wide range of topics, all of which were relevant, and many of which are usually ignored, such as food and sleep.  The material was discussed in a way which I thought would be completely accessible, even fascinating to most patients.  There are predictable limitations: The show can't cover everything, and viewers looking for deep scientific analysis will be disappointed.  That said, it could be run on continuous loop at doctor's offices, and the public would both love it, and benefit.",1452297600,2,768,5.0078740157480315
5705648,5,1939714087,"Beautifully produced and directed, this documentary will inspire you to make the changes you know you need for your life, but have been putting off for too long. Within ten minutes while watching it, I stood up from my chair and remained standing and moving during the remainder of the film. So many remarkable stories here, but I was particularly impressed by Katherine Jeter, whose example will make you want to go out, purchase a bike, and travel the country. Unlike other motivational films that offer sweeping theories, this one encourages you to take small but common sense steps that will build to significant changes. I'm looking forward to more of these films by the director, David Martin.",1452124800,2,699,4.932203389830509
5705649,5,1939714087,"As someone who just interviewed Tom Rath for our Inspire Nation Show, I can see why he's sold over 6 million copies of his books.

His books, and THIS documentary change lives. If you watch this documentary, it'll change your life too. Plain and simple. There's such a wealth of information, so easy to understand and implement. Even if you try just one simple tip, your life will be better for it.

I'm so glad I met Tom, read his book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-You-Fully-Charged-The-3-Keys-to-Energizing-Your-Work-and-Life/dp/1939714036/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are You Fully Charged?: The 3 Keys to Energizing Your Work and Life</a>&nbsp;and watched this documentary.

5705650,5,1939714087,Takes all the great information from the book and brings it alive with compelling stories from real people.  It was great to hear directly from Tom about his own health journey.

The documentary does an excellent job providing compelling stories of people who have changed the way they live to better their life. I found the documentary to be engaging and informative throughout.

Further, David Martin has done an excellent job of making the documentary compelling and easy to follow.

David Martin takes Tom Rath's wisdom and brings it to the people with poignant personal stories.  For those of us who strive to get it right, this film is a motivating and accessible resource.",1453420800,,284,4.320754716981132

5705727,5,1939714087,"We all know we can live better and be better, but we sometimes need reminders of why and how. Fully Charged provides just such motivation and direction -- and in a way that is inviting, informative, and at times, inspiring. This film is packed with ideas on simple behavioral changes that can have long-lasting and far-reaching effects, all well-documented and often explained by the researchers themselves. Thanks for nudging us to eat healthier, move more, listen closer, and live meaningfully.",1452729600,,496,5.2125
5705728,5,1939714087,"David Martin takes Tom Rath's inspirational book and does what only the finest motivational experts can do: Find real people with real stories in real situations to offer real and, given Raths fully charged writing and experience, life-changing lessons. Martins sharp direction paces the perfectly, giving the viewer a chance to fully engage in, learn from, and absorb powerful examples from a strong and substantive cast of modern-day heroes featured in the film. And vivid imagery here pulls us even more deeply into a fully charged environment, showing us just how movers and shakers actually move and shake, showing us how we, too, can get ourselves fully charged by following their (admittedly sometimes-intimidating) examples.  Its hard enough for a Hollywood screenwriter and director to adapt a plot and characters to the screen, but its an entirely different, and I would argue a considerably more difficult job, to translate concepts, ideas, and suggestions into the contagious work that Martin has produced here. While Rath, through his easily accessible writing, can take advantage of nuance that words afford to get his critical and timely thoughts across, Martin has no such luxuryhes at the mercy of the cameras one or two dimensional perspectives and the level of his subjects candor. Because of his brilliant and inspiring work here, we get the luxury of seeing how we can ourselves become fully charged.",1452729600,2,1421,5.232456140350878
5705729,5,1939714087,This documentary was excellent!  Very informative and motivating.  I highly recommend it as a tool to jump start the new year.,1452556800,,126,4.9523809523809526
5705730,5,1939714087,"Every minute of this film is inspirational.  The people on whom the film focuses enjoy the benefits of good nutrition, exercise and sleep and are, therefore, fully charged.  Many well known professors were interviewed to give their slant on what makes a good life.  One fascinating research
project, presented by Nicholas Christakis of Yale demonstrates, by computer imaging,  the fact that one person being nice to another or one person eating too much have much broader results than one would imagine. Similarly, the film touches on many lives,  even on a beautiful garden on the edge of a highway and its creator.
I did love this film and will watch it often to get my charge.",1452297600,,679,4.818965517241379
