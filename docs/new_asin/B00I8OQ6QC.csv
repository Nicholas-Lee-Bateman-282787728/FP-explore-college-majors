6253797,5,B00I8OQ6QC,"My 7-year old son loves this series, as well as my boyfriend and I. Buying these partial seasons are the only way to get them off my DVR! Yes, they are silly and nothing like the original series, but they're nostalgic as they bring up subjects from my childhood. Also very quotable.",1410739200,6,282,4.4423076923076925
6253798,5,B00I8OQ6QC,Very funny for everyone while still staying true to the original,1410566400,,64,4.909090909090909
6253799,5,B00I8OQ6QC,The kids loved it! It was exactly what they were hoping for.,1409961600,,60,4.083333333333333
6253800,5,B00I8OQ6QC,My kids ages 5-11 love it!  Both the boys and the girls love it.  I watch it sometimes with them too and it is quite amusing,1409702400,3,124,3.730769230769231
6253801,5,B00I8OQ6QC,"I absolutely LOVE this show! I can't wait for more episodes, and for when season 2 part 1 comes out on DVD!!",1408665600,4,108,3.9545454545454546
6253802,4,B00I8OQ6QC,"This show is ripe with cleverness and inside jokes. (especially at Batman's and Commisioner Gordon's expense:) Some examples of the cleverness without revealing anything:  comic books, puppets, dreams and grandmas.  Don't forget to bring your sense of appreciation for the absurd!  And remember:  they may be superheros, but they're still kids.",1407801600,,344,5.686274509803922
6253803,4,B00I8OQ6QC,"The only reason this is getting a four star rating is because this really should be season one, not one part 2. DC is in the business of making money though, and I'll bite when it comes to this show. This show is really A hidden gem, humorous and just fun to watch. I enjoy watching it with my child but it's really for me. One of my favorite episodes in the compilation is ""No Power"" where the team is forced by A bet from robin that they can't go 24 hours with out using powers, and the winner of the bet becomes the new leader of the teen titans. If you want to see raven using a segway this is the show for you.",1399507200,13,615,3.928

Infact they don't even play the real teen titans on tv anymore and the movie is very rare to see on live tv now you haft to buy the epicodes im sad trust me this 1s just silly the real deal is better,1438646400,,508,3.80188679245283

The material is early elementary safe and still middle school funny so the whole family can enjoy. The worst we've heard is the occasional ""stupid"" or word to that level.",1435622400,2,341,4.34375

6253844,4,B00I8OQ6QC,"And here we go again with the second half of the first season of the ""Teen Titans"" new animated series as seen on Cartoon Network.  Your favorite Titans are back in action in more hilariously heroic escapades such as:

""Books"" - Raven introduces the other Titans the wonders of imagination through books.  It was a great idea up to a point where they read something that shouldn't be read.
""Power Moves"" - After seeing Beast Boy and Cyborg in a couple of cool combo attacks, Robin decides to try his own with Cyborg.
""Staring at the Future"" - Beast Boy and Cyborg have a staring contest for so long, they suddenly wind up years into the future !
""No Power"" - Robin tests the other Titans with an obstacle course with a catch: They must not use their superpowers to go through it.
""Caged Tiger"" - Robin, Cyborg, and Beast Boy get stuck in the elevator and Robin starts going stir-crazy.  Meanwhile, Starfire and Raven start to bond with Dr. Light.
""Legs"" - Raven loses her cloak, but gains confidence and even a new persona thanks to her newfound set of dynamite gams.
""Waffles"" - Cyborg and Beast Boy can't seem to stop saying the word ""waffles"".  At first it drove the other Titans batty, but BB and Cy's antics might help them defeat Brother Blood.
""Be Mine"" - Terra returns and just in time for Valentine's Day because Beast Boy attempts to profess his love to her.
""Opposites"" - Cyborg's got a crush on Jinx.  And that's not a good thing even to Robin.
""In and Out"" - Robin disguises himself as a villain named ""Red X"" in attempt to destroy the HIVE.  However, that team has more to offer than he thought.
""Little Buddies"" - Cyborg is sad because he does not have a little buddy like the other Titans.  So he attempts to befriend the Pain Bot.
""Missing"" - The boys return Silkie to Killer Moth and earn a lot of money.  However, Starfire is not too thrilled that her little buddy has been taken away.
""Dreams"" - Ever wonder what the Titans dream about?  Well, here's your chance.
""Grandma Voice"" - Cyborg mocks Mother Mae-Eye by putting on his Grandmama voice and before he knows it, that voice takes over Cy's personality.
""Puppets, Whaaaaat?"" - Robin strikes a deal with The Puppet Wizard - big mistake - and now the Titans are puppetized for all eternity.  That is, unless they can defeat The Puppet Wizard in battle.

Do not miss out on even more crazy cool adventures starring the Teen Titans in brand-new episodes Thursday nights only on Cartoon Network !",1424044800,5,2465,4.514606741573034
6253845,2,B00I8OQ6QC,"I am flat out fed up with the way the Teen Titans behave...namely Robin, Cyborg, Beast Boy and Raven. Raven is simply no fun to be around with her dull and lifeless expressions, while Robin is an egotistical, psychotic control freak. Cyborg and Beast Boy are just stupid and annoying. Star fire is the only one I like. While she comes off as being an airhead(obviously the cheese fell off her cracker a long time ago), she is sweet and kindhearted unlike the other jerks in the show. The Hive i find to be more likable than the Teen Titans. They're more interesting to me anyway.",1423008000,2,579,4.471698113207547

6253848,5,B00I8OQ6QC,"Season 1 Part 2 is only better because it continues on with Part 1. We love this show so much. At 11 minutes, each episode is like a little pocket full of humor and delight. Sure, it can be potty humor but other jokes go right over my kids' heads. My husband and I have found ourselves watching the new episodes without kids at home or when already in bed.

Everyone in the house is a fan. We are happily waiting for Season 2!",1421107200,4,426,4.071428571428571
