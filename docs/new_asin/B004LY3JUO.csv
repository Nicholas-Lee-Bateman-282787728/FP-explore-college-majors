8486187,1,B004LY3JUO,"This is the WRONG MOVIE! ""KILL ME PLEASE"" with the cover picture shown is supposed to be an interesting 2017 Brazilian thriller about a group of young women fascinated with a series of murders, starring Valentina Herszage, which was recently in theaters.  Instead, Amazon is showing a 2010 French-language ""black comedy"" about an assisted-suicide facility -- which in my opinion is an awful, nonsensical mish-mash.  (How can a  skilled filmmaker with such good production values not be ashamed to make such tripe?) This is not what I was expecting. Please fix this, Amazon!",1519084800,,573,5.139784946236559

8486189,3,B004LY3JUO,"I would love to review this movie but I don't speak French or Italian. Please I am begging you for the love of God release a version with English subtitles at least, so that the whole world can enjoy this movie.  If there is a script for this in English please contact me. Or if someone wants to translate it for me and send it that would be awesome too. Send to gldndragon@gmail.com. I will change my rating when I can understand the whole movie.

As a side note Saul Rubinek dubbed in Italian is so weird.",1359763200,2,507,4.216494845360825
