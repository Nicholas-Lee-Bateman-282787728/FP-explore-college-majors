2921523,1,B00001U0HL,One of the many stunning qualities of this film is John Alton's mysterious photography--but you won't see anything near to what he created in this dreadful transfer from second- or third-generation source.  It's not even black and white!  More like some murky sepia.  Wait till somebody responsible puts this out right.,981072000,16,319,5.215686274509804
2921524,3,B00001U0HL,"Director Steve Sekely (born in Hungary as Istvn Szkely) made many films over a long career stretching back to 1930, most notably The Day of The Triffids (1962). His fairly obscure film noir Hollow Triumph, alternately known as The Scar, is a gritty thriller about duplicity that delves into dual identities and doppelgangers. Starring Paul Henreid and Joan Bennett, the suspenseful 1948 movie explores a criminal on the run, encountering a chance too good to be true that ends in bitter irony.

Hollow Triumph has a lean, taunt narrative, clocking in at a relatively brisk 82 minutes. John Muller (Paul Henreid) is a career criminal and con man recently out from prison. He knocks over a casino with several associates for $200,000 in cash. The casinos owner, a notorious gangster, promises the crooks will be hunted down until their dying days for his stolen money. Muller moves far away and attempts to go straight, finding an ordinary office job. Concerned he might still get caught with the money, he comes across an improbable stroke of luck. Muller discovers Dr. Bartok, a practicing psychologist, is practically his doppelganger, a dead ringer for the criminal with one exception. Bartok has a huge scar running down his face.

Muller sees his opportunity, soon striking a romance with Dr. Bartoks secretary, Evelyn (Joan Bennett). John Muller uses the womans knowledge and access to glean insight on Bartoks life and practice. Evelyn is an interesting femme fatale, somewhat atypical for noir of this period. Distrusting of men and bitter about her potential suitors, Evelyn takes up with Muller despite knowing hes a con man at heart. Her story is more tragic and bittersweet than most femme fatales. Most will see what is coming next in Hollow Triumph. Muller hopes to permanently end his own troubles by impersonating Dr. Bartok. The ending packs an ironic punch as Muller finally follows his heart.

Hollow Triumph isn't a first-rate film noir but certainly has something going for it. The main plot does turn on a rather ridiculous mistake by Muller, audiences have to buy that Bartoks own wife and friends wouldnt figure out something was amiss when Muller impersonates the psychologist. The cool Muller, a smooth criminal with no qualms about murder, is suddenly driven by passion in a critical moment that feels overly contrived for drama. This is film noir that moves at a rapid clip with its snappy, hard-boiled dialogue, perfect for its themes of doubles and dual identities. It is a hard-boiled pulp yarn that attempts to play with psychological ideas about identity.

Paul Henreid is a great actor and I seek out his movies; however, in this film his performance as a gangster (at the start of the film) appears strained. The plot is less plausible as the individual who turns out to be his double, also happens to have the same accent.  To enjoy this film you must (1) love film noir (2) appreciate the talents of Paul Henreid and (3) not analyze the plot.

2921531,4,B00001U0HL,"Hollow Triumph is a somewhat neglected film noir. It has a fine cast, great LA locations (brilliantly photographed by John Alton) and an unusual dash of surrealism in the plot mechanics. My only complaint is that this DVD transfer lacks clarity (TCM had a better print) and actually shakes in spots. This film, like another neglected noir ""I Love Trouble"" deserves better treatment. Still, worth the price until a better print arrives.",1355961600,11,435,5.055555555555555

Directed by Steve Sekely

John Muller (Paul Henreid), an intelligent, arrogant criminal who has been a medical student and a phony psychoanalyst, believes that people are only interested in themselves and do not notice what is happening around them. Paroled from prison to a boring job, Muller is more interested in a big score, and along with his old cronies robs a crooked gambling joint owned by Rocky Stansyck. Although he gets away with the money, some of his men are caught by Stansyck and identify John as the ringleader. On the run from Stansyck's gang, he is mistaken for Dr. Bartok, a psychiatrist also played by Henreid. Curious, Muller goes to the doctor's office, and meets Bartok's secretary and lover, Evelyn Nash (Joan Bennett). Needing to avoid capture, he assumes Bartok's identity, but first must scar his face like the doctor's.

Agree with other reviewer on this page, this film will appeal to Henreid or Bennett fans, although Bennett fans will wish she had more screen time.  Not exactly a ""film noir"", does not fit as nicely as many noir films.

An interesting film which was is also known as ""The Scar""

2921533,3,B00001U0HL,"""Hollow Triumph"" aka ""The Scar"" stars Paul Henreid and Joan Bennett with brief appearances by Eduard Franz and John Qualen. The film combines elements of film noir with Hollywood's fascination with psychoanalysis.

Paul Henreid plays a petty criminal. He is best known as Victor Laslo, the French anti-Nazi fighter who comes between Bogart and Bergman in ""Casablanca"", and as Jerry Durrance, the man who lights two cigarettes at once and then hands the second to Bette Davis in ""Now Voyager"". Both films were released in 1942, making this quite a year for Henreid, and nothing to look forward to except a long downhill slide. After a series of forgettable films, in the 50s he transitioned to directing for film and TV

Beautiful and spunky Joan Bennett plays a secretary who has an affairs with Henreid. She is best remembered for her recurring role in the TV series ""Dark Shadows"", but in the 40s she was well known for her film noir roles, especially her work with Fritz Lang that started with  ""Man hunt"" (1941). She and Lang formed a production company together, making such memorable films as ""Woman in the Window"" (1944) and ""Scarlett Street"" (1945), both of them with Edward G Robinson. Bennett does her usual excellent job here, and it's hard to understand why she isn't better known for her excellent body of work.

Eduard Franz plays Henreid's brother. This was his second film role. He had a varied career, from the Broadway stage to film and TV. Franz appeared in more than 50 films and made a successful transition to TV in the 50s. He had recurring roles as Gregorio in ""Zorro"" (1958) and as the Psychiatrist Dr. Raymer in ""Breaking Point"" (1963-4). Franz was extremely versatile and could play an Indian (""White Feather""), a Mexican (""Zorro""), a German (""Desert Fox""), etc. I remember him best as Dr. Stern in ""The Thing"" (1951).

We're accustomed to seeing John Qualen in John Ford or John Wayne films. He made nearly 200 films, 9 of them directed by Ford and 4 with Wayne but not Ford - ""Shepherd of the Hills"", ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), ""North to Alaska (1960) and ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963). My favorite John Qualen role was as Lars in ""The Searchers"" (1956). Qualen has a small role as a dentist.

If you look closely, you'll see that one of the gangsters who chases Henreid is Jack Webb, famous as Joe Friday from ""Dragnet"" fame.

Steve Sekely directs. Primarily a European director, he came to the States in 1939 and made several exploitation films (""Revenge of the Zombies"", ""Women in Bondage"", ""Lady in the Death House"") and is probably best known for ""Invasion of the Triffids"" (1962).

The Psychoanalyst is often described as a ""Psychiatrist"" in reviews and descriptions, but in fact he is a ""Clinical Psychologist"".

This isn't a bad film, although it is strange to see the central character (played by Henreid) described as a genius when we find him in jail at the start, then he engineers a robbery that goes terribly wrong, and proceeds to make several significant mistakes that show him to be more of a bumbler than a genius. True, he may be a suave bumbler, but a bumbler nonetheless.

It's also a film in which Henreid appears in virtually every scene. That's a lot of exposure, and there are very few actors or actresses who can command my attention that long. Henreid isn't one of them. Perhaps this is one reason why the film seems to drone on in no particular direction. The only oasis we reach are the scenes in which Bennett appear. She had the same effect in ""Man hunt"", a reasonably drole film apart from her contributions.

The film is often listed as film noir, which it isn't. There are many film noir elements missing, not the least of which is the femme fatale. The film does have a certain symmetry and an irony that is appealing.

Basically this film will appeal to Henreid or Bennett fans, although Bennett fans will wish she had more screen time.",1289260800,12,3902,4.705278592375366
