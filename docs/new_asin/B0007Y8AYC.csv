2251387,1,B0007Y8AYC,While the book this was based on (Charlie's Angels Casebook) had some great insight on one of my all time favorite shows - the movie version does little to shed any real light on the coming and going of the Angels.  The recreation of David Doyles Bosley is a travesty and a true disservice to his memory.  Kate Jackson (although the most convincing played by any of the actresses)is a beer bottle guzzling hard ass.  No wonder Kate posted on her own website asking people to NOT watch this film when it originally aired on television.  Farrah was so upset by the movie and all of the presumptions made of her life at the time that she refuses to even discuss the film.  While all of these behind the scenes films are geared toward the lowest common denominator - This one reaches to the very bottom of the trash heap to entertain(?),1113177600,36,832,4.447368421052632
2251388,3,B0007Y8AYC,"A semi-biopic of the rise and fall of the Charlie's Angels television series. The ladies who portrayed Jaclyn, Farrah and Kate were spot on; however, you don't appreciate this until nearly 30 minutes into the movie. The cheese factor at the beginning is almost too much.

If you were a fan of the show and would like to see a live-action portrayal of some of the inner workings of how it can to be, then by all means, take a view. I would have liked to have had feedback from some of the ladies themselves, just to get their perspectives. (We get as far as the second season, when Cheryl Ladd joined the show.)",1409788800,,610,4.350877192982456
2251389,3,B0007Y8AYC,"Its so cheesy, But if you are a big ""Charlie's Angels"" fan like me you'll love it.....Great to know what really went to behind the show.",1400803200,,136,4.269230769230769
2251390,4,B0007Y8AYC,"I really enjoyed watching it.  It was a fairly accurate portrayal of what went into making Charlie's Angels. The three actresses gave dead on performances of : Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith.",1391558400,,207,5.088235294117647
2251391,3,B0007Y8AYC,"I thought it was ok as a true Anegl's fan, worth having to get a glimpse or in some cases a one sided view point of what was going on behind the scenes of the cult classic tv show.  I am glad to have it but have only watched it once so not sure if I would have had to have it in my collection or if I could have streamed it once to see it and be done.  Would say choose what you feel knowing it is a fluff piece with some information you may not have known.  Enjoy.",1390867200,,465,3.63
2251392,3,B0007Y8AYC,"Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Charlie's Angels is similar to the docudramas done on Dynasty, Three's Company, and Mork & Mindy: people who look like the stars (sometimes they don't even look like them) of said shows play them (most of who cannot act).

This documentary-drama, behind-the-scenes look at Charlie's Angels has it definite ups and downs. A pro of the film is that the casting of Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, and Jaclyn Smith are accurate and intact. However, there is no mentioning to the casting of David Doyle, John Forsythe (who voiced Charlie), or the man that co-starred in the initial pilot. The episodes they show the ""actresses"" filming are not in order.

To start things off, let's discuss the actresses playing Kate, Farrah, and Jaclyn. Well, Lauren Stamile looks a tad like Kate and sounds a lot like her; Tricia Helfer as Farrah does not really look or sound like the real woman; and Christina Chambers as Jaclyn sound like the real one, but looks a lot older than Jaclyn Smith did at the time. The actor portraying David Doyle and Aaron Spelling do not look or sound like them. Disappointing. Very disappointing.

I know some people have complained about the emphasis of Farrah Fawcett, her marriage to Lee Majors, and her exit from the show within the film. It's understandable that Farrah would be mentioned a lot; she was (and still is) the most-popular Angel and everyone who grew up watching the show remembered her leaving. What I don't like is that their is only a small reference and appearance of (an actress as) Cheryl Ladd towards the end of the film, and that fact that neither Shelley Hack nor Tanya Roberts or even mentioned. Yes, it's known Shelley and Tanya weren't popular, then or now, but they were part of Charlie's Angels. Deal with it. The film goes off telling you Jaclyn stayed for all five seasons, Kate left after season three, and Farrah came back for six guest spots later on.

This film was, in my opinion, too short and miscalculated. This is more for entertainment, not accuracy or for the die-hard fans. The film is more campy than factual and it does not (repeat does not) capture the magic or phenomenon that was Charlie's Angels. In fact, it fails miserably. This film is not a total loss, though. Those who like campy reenactments might find it cute, but those of whom are killer fans of the classic series, probably won't. Buy it, if you want, and decide for yourself.",1388880000,2,2447,4.7236533957845435
2251393,5,B0007Y8AYC,"I think this was a great movie about the angels. Lauren Stamille sounded just like Kate Jackson, and the Jaclyn actress looked and sounded just like her. Farrah was ok better the second time I watched it. All in all a great movie but how much of it is true? I don't know--

Dan Castellaneta sounded like Homer Simpson a little too much but still an A.

Highly entertaining if you like this check out 'Surviving Gilligan's Island' or 'Return to the Bat Cave' they are a great behind the scenes treat as well.

BTW--Jaclyn Smith was THEE hottest Angel of all",1387843200,,556,4.431372549019608
2251394,5,B0007Y8AYC,"Jack Condon is Forever a Charlie's Angel Super Fan!
He wrote a great book and I know in my heart that upsetting
 any of the cast was not what he set out to do! I love anything with nostalgia
associated with Charlie's Angles. So, even for a moment of being
propelled back to how it all started is enough for me. But, then again!
I don't like the fact that Kate & Farrah were upset by the movie. Remember ""The Movie""
not Jack's AWESOME book for which it is based on!
So if you are like me and can't get enough of
The Three Little Girls Who Went To The Police Academy, Three replacements, One
Model, John Bosley, John Forsythe as Charlie's voice! A slew of awesome guest stars
then you will enjoy the movie for what it is!!! A quick flashback to how the 70's were when
The Phenomenon of Kate, Jaclyn and Farrah hit The TV Universe!!
PS. I had to amend the star rating because I thought I had hit 5 stars not 4!",1379894400,,907,4.124293785310734
2251395,5,B0007Y8AYC,"I really enjoyed this. The actresses who portrayed Farrah, Kate and Jaclyn were just great, and very believable. Interesting to see the process behind television in the 1970's.",1368835200,,176,5.321428571428571
2251396,5,B0007Y8AYC,"I WAS HESITANT ABOUT PURCHASING THIS DVD WITH IT BEING AN ""UNAUTHORIZIED"" VERSION OF THE STORY, BUT ONCE I WATCHED IT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! VERY GREATLY DONE! I LOVE THE CHOICE OF ACTRESSES WHO PORTRAYED THE ANGELS, AND AARON SPELLING. THERE WAS NOTHING VULGAR OR MIS LEADING ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION AT ALL. IT WAS DONE VERY VERY TASTEFULLY! EVEN WITH ALL OF THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING FARRAH FAWSETT LEAVING THE SHOW AFTER SEASON 1.. IT WAS NOT PORTRAYED NEARLY AS BAD AS I REMEMBER HEARING BACK THEN. THIS IS WAS A VERY CLEVER WAY OF SHOWING US CHARLIE'S ANGELS FANS A BEHIND THE LOOK AT WHAT IT WAS LIKE BACK THEN FOR THE ANGELS, AND THE CREW & MANAGERS. I LOVED THIS LITTLE FILM. BRILLIANT!!!",1341360000,3,704,4.64

2251399,3,B0007Y8AYC,"This movie mainly focuses on the controversy about Farrah Fawcette decision to leave the show after the first season, her relationship with actor Lee Majors and the court battle with Producer Aarron Spelling.

To me, this T.V. movie about the show, should have been made into a two part series.  From what I have read over the years about the show, the real ""drama"" began during the start of the second season and it is now known that, Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd did not get along at all.  Not only that, but also Ms. Jackson's feud with both Aarron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg.

Also, it would have been more interesting if, the movie went more indepth about the other stars personal lives and how the show was affecting their relationships as well.  People don't realize, but during Charlies Angels run, Kate Jackson, Jacklyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd all got divorces from their spouses.",1172275200,12,890,4.753246753246753
2251400,3,B0007Y8AYC,"...since it is told from the point of view of her Manager at the time (presumably the only way NBC, which owns nothing related to Charlie's Angels could get it made).  Everyone is competent and for anyone who really loves the show it will be worth it to see even a little ""behind the scenes"" talk.  But the emphasis on Farrah and the lack of of much drama don't make for a really compelling film.  And given that for many fans, Jaclyn Smith is seen as the real backbone of the show, the slim attention to her and her storyline will be frustrating.  Better to buy the full season sets... but if you're waiting for the next one, you might enjoy this.",1171065600,8,648,4.286885245901639
2251401,5,B0007Y8AYC,"I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie. Each and every aspect of the Charlie's Angels drama comes to fruition in an impressive way--though I don't stress the reality of every event as I do the portrayal of the characters. In particular, Dan Castellaneta (as Aaron Spelling) and Lauren Stamile (as Kate Jackson) are worth the watch. Castellaneta is always a pleasure to watch (his voicework in the Simpsons alone proves his unique talent). But newcomer Lauren Stamile is quite possibly an even more pleasant first. Her brief stint in Off Centre was tremendously entertaining (Paul Weitz never fails), and I'm happy to see that she has been hard at work. Though after such an incredible performance (with, what seems to me, a masterfully accurate impersonation of Kate Jackson's voice and carefully nuanced mannerisms), I cannot help but ask where has she gone?! So many cliched actors out there are getting all the work. Let's see more of Lauren Stamile! As for the other Angels, they too were outstanding. Not as standout-ish as the former two, but without a doubt the whole cast brought to life a very dark and lasciviously extraordinary era in television. I hope NBC (or any other major network) continues to create docudramas of other headline television programs. A+++ production, quality entertainment indeed.",1160352000,3,1323,5.1013824884792625
2251402,3,B0007Y8AYC,"If you are a true fan of Charlies Angels, this one is worth the money spent. The Actresses that played the original trio were very convincing with Kate being the best portrayed by Lauren Stammie, Christina Chambers as Jacylin, who did her voice really well, but the one who played Farrah, Trica Heffer had the look of Farrah, but that was about it. On the other hand , the way the original scienes from the first season were so horribly inacurate, it was sick. I am referring to the reinactment of the shower sciene from Angels in Chains. It was so far off the orginal it was not even funny. Another thing, is the way the movie potrayed David Doyle, which would make the real mcoy turn over in his grave and flip the bird. It made him look like a total bufoon. Oh and they forgot to mention the Jacyln Smith clothing line as one of her sucesses at the end of the flim. Ok other than those little indiscretions, i thought the movie was worth the price paid , and tells the story failry well, and period perfect to say the least, all in the flair and lime green disco atomsphere of the seventies.",1121904000,4,1094,4.315533980582524

2251406,2,B0007Y8AYC,"Another scandal-free TV movie comes to DVD. As a big fan of the original series in all it's jumping-up-&-down(literally)glory, I waited with high hopes to view this promising ""behind-the-screens"" biopic. I figured they had to go one of two ways - camp or scandal. Well, they didn't do either. This is just a brief history that glosses over everything in 10 seconds flat. NOT A CAT-FIGHT ANYWHERE. Darn it. This was a non-sensational movie about a very sensational(at the time)TV show. Someone missed the point here. It could have been SO much more. I have seen other behinds-the-scenes biographies with actual interviews(both then & now)with the girls & when Cheryl Ladd joined the cast she made it quite clear that the two remaining Angels were(initally)quite mean to her. Where the heck was any of that ?! That's what we want to see ! I don't even really recall ""Cheryl"" being in this for more than a passing moment - another golden opportunity forgone...(sigh). You could watch this with your Grandma, but again it's a TV Movie. The one point of interest (albeit for die-hard fans only) is the actresses they have cast as the 3 original Angels. They were fantastic & really did their homework in terms of representing the girls.  Very believable as Kate, Farrah & Jaclyn. Lauren & Christina (who played Kate & Jaclyn respectivly) even had their speech patterns down-pat. I guess that surmizes my review: For the ""jiggle heard around the world"" this was disappointingly-impressive. Enjoy, my Angels...",1118188800,3,1503,4.964285714285714

In certain scenes the actors really did look like the original actors.  I enjoyed the feel of the TV-movie and the music.  The actress playing Kate Jackson really did a great job, she sounded just like Kate/Sabrina.  Amazon has set a great price for this DVD.  What do you have to lose.
