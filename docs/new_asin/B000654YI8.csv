8038769,5,B000654YI8,"This documentary came in fresh as new and factory sealed. That to me was a plus and having this rare documentary exceeded my expectations. It was well done to solidify my purchase as top notch. If you're a NASCAR fan and want a documentary of a yearlong journey, this is a must have in the days where racing DVDs are hard to come by.",1470009600,,333,4.21875
8038770,5,B000654YI8,"As a lifelong Rusty Wallace fan, who's still reeling from his retirement, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  Any true blue 2 fan should definitely check this one out!",1139443200,2,164,4.857142857142857
8038771,5,B000654YI8,"One of today's most popular Nascar drivers is Rusty Wallace. This DVD is a good retrospect of Rusty's career. Although there was a VHS version (back in the mid 90's) of his racing life that was alot better.

  Also for the Wallace fan that can't get enough of Rusty. The movie Days Of Thunder has a cameo appearance of our racing hero. And the 1st seaon of The Duke's Of Hazard TV series interviews him in the special feature section.

  Thank you Rusty for your time and effort for the making of this DVD.",1135555200,,506,4.329787234042553
8038772,4,B000654YI8,"First off let me just say that this video is a bit dated, it follows Rusty thru the 2001 season.  Other than that this is a very good insight into the highs and lows associated with NASCAR.  This video shows the life of the whole whole team, not just the driver (these guys can make a pit stop in 13 secs. but they sure can't sing kareoke.)  Very well shot and edited, with lots of interviews.  Definetely worth watching if you are a NASCAR fan.",1114387200,3,445,4.2
