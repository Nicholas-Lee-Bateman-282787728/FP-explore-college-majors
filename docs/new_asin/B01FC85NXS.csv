8760584,5,B01FC85NXS,"You can buy Prison School on DVD already and Monster Musume will apparently be released in July 2017. This is a combination DVD of the two series. It is a region 0 DVD which will play on any DVD player. Each series comes on 1 disk with 13 episodes per disk. 13 episodes per disk? Yes it's possible. This is a Malaysia or China version with no dubbing but there are subtitles in Chinese, English and Malay. This package shows what can be achieved if you try. I wish other series came in this form even if there are some compromises on the sub-titles (but not enough to matter).

Prison School - I had thought about buying this series but had never pulled the trigger. Now I've seen it I'm sure I would have been disappointed by a ""full-fat"" version. The first six episodes are really quite disagreeable with entirely unsympathetic characters. It does get better but I'm not sure I'd watch this series again even though there is a lot of fan service. The fan service does get quite samey and can't make up for the rest of the series.

Monster Musume - I first watched this series on Crunchyroll and really enjoyed it. There is no real over-arching story arc but it is a series of vignettes of what can happen when monsters become members of mainstream human society. It's fun and funny as Lamias harpies, centaurs slimes and so on try to live in the same house. The co-ordinator is a nice take on Men in Black as Miss Smith fails to be as helpful as needed. The fan service is there but apparently much diluted from the manga. This is just a fun series.",1497744000,,1551,4.381944444444445

8760590,5,B01FC85NXS,Was looking for Monster Musume series  w/ subtitles but having the Prison School series included was a great find. And of course both being Uncut versions. I've always hated censorship for my anime. The price for this product was also great. Only drawback was that it wasn't Blue-Ray but only a minor drawback.,1484697600,5,310,4.849056603773585
