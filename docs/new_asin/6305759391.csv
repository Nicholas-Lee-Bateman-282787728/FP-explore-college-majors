1078466,4,6305759391,"Like most ""low-budget"" films, THE CONTRACT suffers some of the usual problems one finds in indie films.  Namely a wafer thin plot with lots of holes that require LOTS of imagination on the part of the viewer.  But the script is decent and the acting doesn't come across as ""acting"".  The characters are actually fairly well developed and not ""wooden"".  The major problem is that the characters seem to be operating in a vacuum, completely removed from the rest of the world.  You'll travel to a ""no-name"" city, in an unknown state, see a U.S. presidential candidate apparantly campaigning for Canadian Prime Minister (given all the Canadian TV microphones at his press conference), and for all the dead bodies and assassinations, there's not a hint of any interest by the police in what the main characters are up to!  So, as I said, the viewer will need a bit of imagination to fill in the holes and place the action into the ""real"" world.  Above all, you will need to ""suspend reality"" and focus on the narrow world in which these characters operate.

Even given this seemingly major flaw, it doesn't seem to detract from your ability to enjoy what's an otherwise exciting, action packed movie.  Johanna Black carries the film well, Billy Dee Williams adds some star power (though you can't help feel he was ""underused"") and there's lots of action.

THE CONTRACT is what it is--a low-budget action film.  It delivers with better than average characters, above average script, good acting and lots of action.  Just check ""reality"" at the door and imagine that somewhere, off camera, the rest of the world is still out there!!!

All in all I'd give FOUR stars to THE CONTRACT because, if nothing else, it does ONE THING VERY WELL--it provides 90 minutes of ENJOYABLE ENTERTAINMENT!!  That, it seems, is something that even HUGE budget, major studio ""blockbusters"" fail to do all to often!!",1180828800,6,1889,4.826086956521739
1078467,3,6305759391,"I've become strangely attracted to this indie actioner out of Canada. A ""think-I-can"" combination of TV's ""Alias"" and John Woo gun-opera.
Johanna Black is striking as hit woman Hannah, and Billy Dee Williams just has fun as the slimey US Senator.
Sure, BDW's toadies need some acting lessons, but they're easy to ignore as director Bascombe continuously slows down Hannah's gun-toting posing for a cool effect.",1017792000,4,410,5.2272727272727275

7895390,4,6305759391,"Hannah (Johannah Black) is raised by and trained by an assassin named Luc (Laurent Imbault). Running for President of the United States, Senator Harmon (Billy Dee Williams) sets up Luc and Hannah to be murdered in order to ""tie up loose ends"" over dangerous knowledge Luc has on Senator Harmon. All Hannah really wants to do is settle down with her boyfriend and lead a normal life. Sadly, they kill Luc but Hannah gets away, vowing to turn the tables on her would-be assassin. The rest of the movie is a cat-and-mouse game, with Senator Harmon and Hannah taking turns as the cat.  Good acting, an intricate plot, and plenty of action make this a movie worth watching.

7895394,2,6305759391,"It wasn't horrible, but it was fairly weak. The acting was so-so and even when they decided to use their small budget to blow up a car, it was done poorly.

For low budget, I guess that's okay.",1509753600,,193,4.078947368421052
7895395,3,6305759391,"not nearly as bad as many indie films; no one does terrible acting, and often the dialog makes sense and actually flows.

the plot is thin and often implausible (how exactly is the lightweight artist suddenly a fast, accurate shooter under stress?  why on earth would a police office surrender his weapon to a couple of maniac killers?), and the action scenes, while a little weak, are at least a solid C+;

special effects very weak, but there weren't many so they did little damage",1509494400,3,483,4.658823529411765

And my pistols would totally lunch my hearing if I shot them inside a steel hold.  Dang, the firearms industry is ripping me off!  Or maybe it's the film industry and its pervasive ignorance about actual guns and the people who use them professionally.",1509321600,2,405,4.597222222222222
