7425777,4,B0152AVXUI,"This film is strange, loaded with disarming comic relief, geriatrically creepy, twisted, and doesnt feel like found footageall in a good way.  The theme would have worked better if rated-R, but this still stands out as an exceptional with solid performances from our young actors.

More playfully approached than in his past endeavors, Shyamalan returns to tell the Grimm-undertoned story of two young children going to meet their estranged grandparents for the first time.  Their mother (Kathryn Hahn) is conflicted about the visit, having not spoken to her parents in the fifteen years since she left on bad terms as a teenager.  We all know from the trailers that the grandparents seem nice yet weird.  Perhaps just early onset dementia?  Or perhaps a big Shyamalanadingdong twist!  Because thats what weve come to know Shyamalan for, right?  Big twists.  Bruce Willis was dead the whole time!  Sam Jackson was the villain!  Everything happens for a reasonSWING AWAY!  So its fair to say that there is almost definitely something behind the curtain that isn't evident from the trailer.

The performances by the two child actors are compelling and manage to direct us through the story surprisingly effectively.  The 13 yr old boy Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) seems gawky at first, but he turned out to be great and what seemed the least credible about him at first quickly became his most endearing characteristic.  He provides the more nave perspective along with the comic relief, rapping in front of Nana, joking about dead bodies in the work shed (far before anything strange has happened), and being the first to frighten.  The first two thirds of this film will find you smiling quite often and nearly entirely due to this characters welcomed antics.  It may downplay the urgency but it also contributes to lowering our guard.

The older sister Becca (Olivia DeJonge), our filmographer in this odyssey of estranged family reunification, is the serious one.  Intent on uncovering and documenting her grandparents forgiveness for her mothers alienation, she keeps the story grounded and provides a credible case for found footage as she sets out to simultaneously feed her hunger for filmmaking and mend a sundered family.  She is articulate, perceptive beyond her years, and along with Tyler she harbors a powerful insecurity after recently being abandoned by her father.

Both children excel in offering refreshingly sincere performances and credible characters.  Between their anxious mother and their quirky senescing grandparents, these children serve as our home base in terms of sanity.  But we also watch as they turn a blind eye to some red flags in the name of senility and their desire to have a more complete family.

After some understandably awkward introductions, their week of family bonding kicks off with some home cooking by day and an intro to the weirder side of senility by night.  It turns out that Nana (Deanna Dunagan) suffers from a form of nocturnal dementia called sun downing.  Her mornings are filled with a sweet, meek farmhouse manner.  But her late nights are filled with projectile vomiting, charging through the hallways, and nude wall scratchingmaking her a good candidate for a home visit from an old priest and a young priest.  But its not just Nana.  Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie; Daredevil) is occasionally non-responsive, paranoid, confused, and hes doing something in his work shed.  He also doesnt want the kids in the basement or to leave their bedroom after 9:30pm.  Many elderly folks run a tight ship and have some reasonable rules of the house, but these just raise suspicions.

With each day they seem to encounter increasingly strange behavior lending less and less credence to the grandparents mental wellness or the kids safety.  However, our guard is dropped with the understanding that they're just old.  We are reminded of this notion repeatedly by the grandparents themselves.  We want to accept their frailties and overcome our feeling of uneasiness.  We, too, have grandparents and we don't want to take away their independence should they start to fadeat least, not until theyve faded too far.  And how far is too far?  This story tests that boundary.

As if serving as a countdown of some horrible conclusion, each day is marked by a caption on the screenMonday. TuesdayWednesday  The visit wears down to its last days and the weird behavior mounts, and so does Beccas penchant to film interviews and capture the catharsis of forgiveness to help heal their long-estranged family.  No matter how strange (or bad) things seem, she still wants her interviewand Nana really doesnt seem comfortable giving that up.  One must wonder why.

I often questioned just where this ride was taking us?  Some people stop by the house and I start to wonder if the grandparents are possessed by some unconventional means, or if they are part of a cult, or if they are being compelled or threatened to do something to the kids.  Was their mother unknowingly going to be a victim of one of these things until she escaped by running away?

With The Village (2004) and The Lady in the Water (2006) under his belt, it should come as no surprise that Shyamalan festoons his story with dark fairy tale imagery.  Were off to grandmothers house located far from the nearest neighbors with Nana filling her fare with freshly baked confections, a Grimm flashback as she urges her granddaughter into the oven with a bizarre smile, a grandfather smacking of a twisted woodsman role, things start out so nice but slowly degenerate into their true nature, and all of the house rules.  Further seasoning this fairy tale stew is Beccas reference to a magical elixir (i.e., forgiveness) to cure her mother and Nana tells tales of another planet where everyone can be happy together.  This is framed as a cautionary tale, but with the caution kept secret until the end.

More creepy than scary, littered with down-to-earth comic relief, and with a premise that makes found footage appropriate--this is an example of film done right as it distracts us from the finish line while providing all the signs that clearly point us in the right direction.  It also hardly feels like found footage after the first 10 minutes as the shots are typically steady.

The final twist is horrifying in concept but doesnt translate to film as effectively as Shyamalans past reveals have.  But I don't care.  I liked it a lot for what it was.  The scenes are all entertaining, whether funny or tense.  Truly, though, from the light-hearted and often comical opening acts, Shyamalan was trying to transition us to more dire feelings.  It only sort of worked.  I must also admit that this was something that really wanted to be rated R.  Of course, thats not Shyamalans style.  But I think that an R-treatment would have improved it; it would have fueled the shift from comic relief in the beginning to a third act of greater gravity.

Overall, I was very pleased with this.",1442361600,7,6971,4.942390369733448

The title refers to the visit two kids take to see the grandparents their mother hasn't seen since running away at the age of 15 or 17. The grandparents are *weird* to say the least. By day they are *normal*, at night nana is *very strange* . Pop pop tells them how he used to see a *white thing with yellow eyes* run fast through the factory where he worked. He starts acting *strange* too.
The kids, who are filming everything for a documentary, are soon told that these people AREN'T their grandparents - and so the fun begins.

This movie, which has a couple of scenes reminiscent of the classic children's fairy tale, ""HANSEL AND GRETEL"", seemed to start out kind of slow, and at first, I suspected this movie would be disappointing.

I truly hope I am wrong on all accounts and hope we get to see more great movies from said director down the road.

7426314,1,B0152AVXUI,"Yet again I've been tricked by my own morbid fascination to see if M Night can turn around his losing streak, and once again I wonder how this ever got made. Whatever quality control exists at studios to force rewrites and reshoots seems to simply not happen at a ""Written and Directed by N Night"" picture, and it results in first-draft quality stories that are ineffective in their execution and amateurish in their storytelling.

Combining many of the terrible elements of previous N Night stinkers, The Visit also throws in cringe-worthy teen rapping, tangential medical mumbo-jumbo and tries to revive the found footage genre. At 90 minutes it feels long, with the running time including endless scenes of teens chatting that could have been cut, all so we can race towards the unsurprising shocker ending more befitting of a 45-minute episode of The Outer Limits.

While it's true that it's better than The Happening, there's still nothing going on here. Character development in his films is increasingly about people facing some past trauma combined with fighting the bad guy in the final scene (""Swing away Merrill!""), which simply doesn't work. Everything is contrived to push the characters towards his trademark surprise ending, which might be fine if the story had any suspense or scares but it's a total snooze to get there.

I think this is my last M Night experience. It's hard to believe that 15 years ago, Signs managed to compel audience attendance by boasting both Mel Gibson and M Night in the same film. He was bad then, worse now, and it's pretty clear at this rate he'll be competing with Tommy Wiseau in another decade.",1498348800,3,1643,4.881720430107527

7426355,1,B0152AVXUI,"Oh my, how far the mighty have fallen. I have been following M. Night's career since 'The Sixth Sense' and he had yet to dissapoint me until now.

I went into this movie with somewhat of high expectations because it is an M. Night film afterall and I had heard good things about the film. The problem here is that the mystery and suspense seems to be building towards something bizarre and sinister, but instead it culminates into a formulaic ending and absolutely nothing worth making a film about. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet so I will leave it at that.

The next problem I had with this film is that first person, shaky camera footage style that was used throughout. I get the feeling that M. Night just gave the cameras and the script to the kids and told them to go shoot a movie. Its that awful! There are several scenes where the kids encounter scary experiences and instead of dropping the camera and run, like most kids would, they continue to shoot footage and have the presense of mind to make commentary after the scary moment passes. Very unrealistic and annoying.

This brings me to my biggest complaint about the film. The kid actors and the characters they play in this film are EXTREMELY ANNOYING, particularly the boy. I cringed everytime I heard him rap, and his mannerisms and facial expressions are so over the top that I couldn't stand to look at him. The girl is very annoying in the way that you might find most child prodigies to be annoying. She apparently has a high IQ and is very mature for her age. Throughout the film she tries to act like a journalist and reporter by interviewing her grandparents and constantly brings up subjects that visibly cause them pain. I thought her character was very cold and selfish and devoid of any redeeming qualities.

Overall I would recommend watching this film if you are an M. Night fan so that you can say that you saw it but don't go into it expecting to see a good film.",1496188800,,1979,4.458563535911602

I think I can remember 5-6 episodes like that off the top of my head. So I can't say this movie is very original. Smh. And then you throw in the ""Paranormal Activity"" vibe and there you have a movie.

It's a shame that Night's writing has come to this. When The Sixth Sense came out, I thought I would be seeing great films from him for many years of my life. Now that I'm 39, it's pretty clear that isn't going to happen.",1491350400,,624,4.114754098360656

7426428,4,B0152AVXUI,"I'm an M. Night Shyamalan fan regardless of the negative response many of his movies have received. This was another movie of his I recently discovered and greatly enjoyed. Suspense and psychological thrillers are my favorite types of movies, and perhaps why I like this director. Two kids go to visit their estranged grandparents, for the first time in their lives, in the Pennsylvania countryside while their mother enjoys a cruise with her new boyfriend. The older sister is documenting their trip and interviewing their grandparents as her way of better understanding her mother's past and what caused the rift that prevented them from knowing their grandparents. All the daughter knows is that something ""horrible"" happened when her mother left home at 19 years old and never came back/had contact with her parents. The daughter senses that if only the grandparents forgave her mother, maybe she could find a sense of peace that seems to have been missing.

Now, while it's obvious fairly early into the movie that something is going on with the grandparents, and you may even guess what it is as the story moves along, I enjoyed how the suspense built quite wonderfully. I enjoyed the development of the story line and how, as part of human nature, when confronted with something that's difficult to comprehend or extremely odd, we deny what is happening and provide comfort to ourselves through simple rationalizations. The older sister engages in this pattern until quite late into the film and unfortunately this causes her and her little brother some problems. Having a younger brother myself, I can appreciate how this character can seem annoying most of the movie but is really more intelligent and insightful than others (esp. his sister), often given him credit for.

**WARNING - SPOILER: While there are some story points that could have been further developed (how the imposter grandparents arrived at the home; how neighbors didn't seem to notice the real people missing sooner, etc) the movie was done well enough for it to work.  OVERALL, I highly recommend giving this movie a chance... and of course you can always watch it for free on HBO go if you have an HBO subscription!!",1490486400,,2197,4.9809264305177114

7426433,5,B0152AVXUI,"I watched this having no idea what it was about save the cover photo.  I was expecting a crappy movie.  However I was pleasantly surprised.

I'd recommend this if you like found footage, realistic horror, and integrity of character/plot.  Found footage can often seem boring, but I find the realistic feeling you get from them compelling.  The most impressive thing about this movie was that the plot and the character dialog was believable.  I get really annoyed by plot holes and characters that don't seem believable, but that wasn't the case here (save for one scene where the girl decided to check something out near the end).  It is rare for a horror film to be both scary and believable, but this was both.

Since I wasn't expecting a twist, I didn't figure it out.

So far as the scare factor, it definitely is creepy.  There's a few jump scares.  Some of the scares earlier on are a little funny.

I think this movie would be more fun to watch with a friend who doesn't have a short attention span.  If you get bored during dialog you might find it boring.

Anyway, overall I really liked this and was thoroughly entertained.",1488844800,2,1134,4.577114427860696

7426469,3,B0152AVXUI,"Teenage siblings Becca and Tyler go to visit their estranged grandparents in rural Pennsylvania. Their mom ran out on the grandparents when she was 19. She fell in love with an older man, the father of Becca and Tyler. He has since left for California with another woman. She'd like to go on vacation with her new boyfriend, so to give her a break, the kids agree to the visit. Becca is also an aspiring film maker. She brings her camera and plans to document their week getting to know their grandparents and hopefully find a way to reconcile them to her mom. It's a sweet idea. Unfortunately, the grandparents' behavior becomes more and more unsettling, leaving the children to doubt their safety in the middle of nowhere.

I was interested to see this since it was touted as Shyamalan's comeback movie. I did find parts of it tense and exciting but the ""found footage documentary"" style has been done quite a bit and I didn't see anything particularly new here, especially no solution to the ""why are they still carrying cameras around?"" problem towards the end. The unknown actors are all good in their parts and give their characters humanity. Shyamalan is good at writing smart kids and getting child actors to deliver good performances. I did care about the siblings but the situation is a little too familiar for really big scares or surprises.

Recommended for Shyamalan fans or if you haven't seen a bunch of ""found footage"" films like The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity.",1487721600,,1493,4.760617760617761

Even though I have a couple complaints with The Visit, this is my favorite M. Night Shyamalan film. I've seen them all & hated the others except for this one. I LOVED the hide & seek scene underneath the house & what happened after. I couldn't help but laugh. Also the scene where the boy & girl hear some noises late at night, investigate, the boy opens the door &......... *Jesus Becca, I'm going blind* How can you not laugh at that?! My only complaints would be the forgiveness scene. It felt totally unnecessary & should've been left out & only added as a deleted scene. I think The Visit should've ended with the back of the cop car. If it did, The Visit would've ended perfectly. My other complaint would be the final rap scene. Another thing that was unnecessarily added at the end. Other then that, The Visit was a great horror movie that just straight up CREEPED me out from start to finish. I would tell anybody & everybody to see it. Even better, watch it with the lights off, late at night but Most of all, turn it off after the scene in the cop car",1482537600,,1229,4.3478260869565215

The biggest problem with this movie is that it's another one of those movies that is filmed by the characters within it.  I'm so tired of this format that I almost shut it off the minute I found out it was filmed like that.  As far as I'm concerned, this format only worked for ""The Blair Witch Project"" -- which was the first of its type.  Other than ""The Blair Witch Project"", this format fails for every other movie that uses it.  I'm so sick of it that I probably won't watch any more movies that are shot this way.  I'm normally a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  Had it been shot with the conventional format, it would have been much better.  The story's decent, but the format is a huge turnoff for me.",1475712000,,828,4.256410256410256

It has some bizarre tonal inconsistencies involving the younger brother of the story especially an awful end credits scene that if would've been left out I could've easily forgiven its earlier flaws. One the plus side this movie is very scary and disturbing for the most part especially in the excellent third act. I don't know why Shyamalan felt he needed to have the strange attempted comedy with the younger brother. This could've been a masterpiece.

7426661,1,B0152AVXUI,"Walking into the over crowded theater to see yet another over hyped M. Night Shyamalan movie, I already missed the money I had spent on the 90 minute torture. Let's face it, Shymalan has not made a fantastic movie in over a decade and this movie does not show any signs of him getting any better.
We all know as soon as we turn on a Shymalan movie that there is going to be a plot twist that is so obscure that we would never have thought of it, but the Visit fails to deliver this mind blowing twist. The idea that the 'grandparents' were mental patients who had escaped seemed pretty self explanatory from the start. Not only is the twist a complete failure but the movie delivers no real scare. There are a few cheap jump scares throughout, but no suspense or build up.
The children in the movie are seldom frightened by the bizarre behavior of their 'grandparents', but they do make a lot of jokes about them and are very sarcastic about everything that happens. This strongly takes away from the horror factor. Think about it. You're stuck in a place with 2 elderly people you have never met who are very strange and at one point you even record one of them knocking on your door with a knife. Witty banter is the last thing on your mind.
Finally the very last issue with this movie comes from one of the last scenes in which the 'grandfather' shoves dirty diaper in the young boys face and in retaliation, the boy kills the old man all the while yelling like the hype man at an 8 mile rap battle. No not like he's yelling because he's a minor killing someone who just shoved crap in his face, but literally like Eminem's on stage hype guy. As if that wasn't enough to defeat the end of this movie, after a touching scene with their mother, the movie cuts to the young boy in his sisters room rapping about his visit. If a kid had crap shoved in his mouth he wouldn't be writing a rap about it. If a kid had to kill someone to go home he wouldn't be rapping about it. He would be talking to a therapist and not acting as if nothing had ever happened.
In conclusion, this movie was unrealistic, the emotions of the kids were very unnatural, the plot twist was barely a twist, and I would never see this movie again if I was paid to.",1474243200,,2236,4.251173708920188

7426699,1,B0152AVXUI,"I enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's earlier movies, but it seems like each of his films have become progressively stupider and stupider over the years. The Visit is supposedly a horror movie. To be honest, if it had been any ""scarier"" I might have fallen asleep.

The movie is centered around two kids who are visiting their grandparent's for the first time. The two actors playing the kids overact so badly in this film that it looked like some failed attempt at a reality TV series. I mean, their acting is just so over-the-top obnoxious that it seems like they are acting badly on purpose. The director's jerky, worn-out attempt at making the movie seem to be some fake documentary (i.e. The Blair Witch Project) made everything all that more unrealistic.

The result was a movie that I couldn't wait to end. No spoilers here, but the movie ended pretty much exactly as one would have expected long before the finish. By the time it was over I was rooting for the psychopaths in the story to do-away with these two obnoxious kids who are supposedly the ""good guys"". If you ever run into M. Night Shyamalan, please tell him that he owes me two hours of my life back.",1470700800,,1163,4.559808612440191

7426713,2,B0152AVXUI,"This movie was very much not what I expected it to be. In some ways that was good, and in other ways it was bad. Unfortunately, in the end, it was a movie that I would categorize month those whose plot lines are shallow and repetitive. A LOT of modern horror movies appear to follow similar lines. An example that comes to mind is ""The House at the End of the Street.""

My partner and I got this movie on a free rental promotion. I've been wanting to see it since the trailers were playing on television and it seemed like a good ""date night"" diversion for us. I love horror movies and had high expectations based on the impression the trailers had left me with. Unfortunately, it was a misguided perception.

The movie uses a documentary style, similar to the Blair Witch Project. I am not personally a fan of this cinematic style, but if it's your thing, then this movie might be right up your alley. The documentary follows two teenagers, Becca and Tyler, whose father left them five years ago. Their mother has not spoken to her parents in fifteen years, but they have reached out to her to request a visit with her children. The documentary chronicles their visit with their grandparents, and the surprising and weird behavior of the elderly people with whom they are spending the week.

If that sounds boring, that's the gist of the movie. The elderly grandparents behave in strange ways. THERE ARE JUMP SCARES. They are minor, but they got my heart racing, so this is something to be aware of if you were hoping to avoid them.

If you enjoy this new breed of horror films, you may enjoy this movie. I, however, am glad the rental was free.",1469750400,,1646,4.476666666666667

I won't give away the surprises, but the clues are fairly given to the audience throughout the movie. It's a fun movie, and I recommend it. I loved Sixth Sense, and I also loved Unbreakable (though not quite as much). I'm also one of the fans who thought The Village was pretty good.

7426817,2,B0152AVXUI,"I guess you can say that with this film, M Night is getting closer to what he does best: more intimate and suspenseful low budget movies with great characters development. I thought the set up was great and the pay off at the end was flabbergasting (although some people might have guessed it right from the beginning because that is also what you expect from that director  great payoff that you try to guess right from the start).

Still, I must admit that I was disappointed. First, its a shame that composer James Newton-Howard wasn't there for the score. He did all of Shyamalans films and I can only imagine what beautiful and lyrical music he would have given us. But that is not what saddened me the most. From what I know, that director has been sort of banned from Hollywood in regards of his well, of his tendency to see himself bigger or more important than he really is. Also, he seems to look at studio interference as a bad thing. Well I don't think that he learned his lesson with this film. Especially if you listen to him in the special features on the DVD or Blu-ray. He really seems to think that he is the one who decided to film a low budget film with relatively unknown actors. For the love of some kind of cinematic purity, he adds (Hollywood being a sort of pimp encouraging cinematic prostitution). From what I read and listen, that is clearly not the case. It looks like he was shown the way out because of his condescending behavior and the fact that he was deluding himself into being the next Spielberg. So clearly, he still thinks that way. And a lot of the scenes in this film drag out for way too long with nothing really happening. I just felt that those scenes weren't there for the good of the film but rather for his own good (enabling him to show off  look at how well I can shoot a quiet scene, look at how well I can develop a character, etc.)

My point is: Shyamalan is clearly a gifted storyteller. But he also seems to think way too highly of himself. From what I can see, that was his downfall. And obviously, it isn't clearly over. This low budget film is surely a step in the right direction but I sadly doubt that things will get better for him. Not with the things he says in the documentary. Its a loop. He will become successful again and hell get kick out again. I hope Im wrong because some of the scenes in this film are strikingly effective and can only be done by a gifted filmmaker.",1465689600,,2438,4.328227571115974

7426896,4,B0152AVXUI,"This movie is a very weird combination of elements and I can see why many people are not very fond of it.  The boy's character is relatively believable and the mother was actually very well written for what little time she has on screen.  The daughter and aspiring documentary filmmaker is not very believable at all.  Her dialogue is awkward and to be frank, no child, even very intelligent children, talks like she does throughout the movie.  This is M. Night's biggest problem that he simply cannot shake - he writes himself into his movies even when he is not directly in front of the camera, and the goofy manner in which he speaks is the manner in which at least one or more of his characters speaks in every movie save a couple shining examples.  He tends to sabotage himself with his own ego and it's too bad.

The Visit also has clashing elements of very disturbing imagery and quirky humor.  Brutal murder followed by adult diaper jokes is not everyone's cup of tea.  It didn't bother me, but maybe I'm just a freak.

The ever pervasive Shyamalan ""twist"" ending was as predictable as every other movie he has done over the past several years.  I had it pegged by the first quarter of the film, and I was hoping it was a red herring to throw me off.  It wasn't.  Really, M. Night, try a double twist or something different next time - for god's sake.

So, why despite all of these glaring problems did I give this film four stars?  First, because my expectations were at rock bottom.  I hate about 90% of Shyamalan's library.  He is truly a filmmaker that hit his peak within his first two films.  This movie was at least better than every other movie he has done in a long time. Second, though the character and story elements were messy, the imagery was, in my opinion, pretty frightening.  I didn't think M. Night had it in him, but there were some ghastly moments in this that I really enjoyed because they were things I had never seen in another film, and I've seen just about everything from every era of film from every country in the world.  I think that if this movie had been made by some indie film director rather than Shyamalan for a low budget it would have received a lot more love, but M. Night has worn out his welcome with most of the world and just his name on the movie elicits a thumbs down.

I would recommend people give this a chance (rent or watch for free, do not buy).  A group of friends and some beer make this pretty enjoyable, as long as you go into it with the intention of having fun rather than taking it seriously.",1463616000,,2558,4.365750528541226

7426899,5,B0152AVXUI,"The ""Visit"" is neither a slasher film nor a syfy; it's REALISTIC and PLAUSIBLE, which makes it all that much scarier, IMO.  It also had me totally fooled.

""The Visit"" accomplishes its purpose, which is to scare the living daylights out of you and fool you at the same time.  Reminds me of Hitchcock, only much scarier than Hitchcock.

In fact, ""The Visit"" made all the other popular horror films I've seen -- ""The Exorcist,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Shining,"" etc. -- seem like Disney movies to me in comparison.

It's definitely NOT suitable for children, IMO.  I'm not even sure it's suitable for adults -- it gave me nightmares!",1463270400,,622,4.712962962962963

7426924,5,B0152AVXUI,"I have quite a few things to say about this movie.

A.
The first 15 minutes are a waste of time.  You can watch the first 5 then skip ahead to minute 14.5, and you won't miss much.

B.
One reviewer complained about the ""found footage"" look of the movie.  I HATE that shaky camera work, but in this case, it really isn't that bad!  MUCH MUCH better than the second Bourne movie, which made me motion sick to the point I almost left the theater.

Now to the review:
It went like this...

In the first 15 minutes, I was bored out of my mind, and thought ""why would I want to watch this?  It is like a boring movie some kid made.  Very trivial nothing.

Then after that first 15 minutes and to the middle it became mildly interesting although quite slow.  There were some good creepy parts that were mildly spooky.

Then the last act, had that trademark M. Night Twist, but this time, it didn't fall flat like so many of M. Nights recent movies!

I guess it had been a while since I saw the previews for this, so I didn't see it coming at all! Even though there were hints throughout the movie the entire time!

Then of course, no horror movie would be complete without the main characters doing something stupid.

The end of this movie was not your typical horror movie, and even with the boredom of the first parts, I give it 5 stars!

All in all, if you have the patience, this is an excellent film worth watching!  I wanted to see this film when it was first announced, and despite the bad reviews, I remembered that I wanted to watch it and rented it.

I am VERY glad I ignored the bad reviews and got this!",1462924800,2,1608,4.182410423452769

7426927,5,B0152AVXUI,"This is a straight up horror jumper that is fun to watch.  It is suspensful, jumpy, sometimes stressful, thoroughly enjoyable, and very intense at times.  My wife and I saw  it in the movie theater, and the ladies behind us said at one point, ""I can't take this S%^&t!"" from the intensity and suspense of the scenes. It mixes in a little humor right in the middle of the intense scenes, and it does it in appropriate way.  That aspect reminds me of Jurassic Park (the first one), where the children characters or the chaotician throw in humor while being chased by dinosaurs--it was appropriate and not disconnected from what was going on.  All the actors are great and the children are easy to connect with.  We didn't like the boy at first, but he grew on us as the movie went.  If you like suspenseful horror jumpers, you have to see it.  If you get scared at horror films but kind of like getting scared, you should see it.  It's not gruesome.

T his kid is supposed to be nine or ten but fast talks like a 21-year-old smart ass. To make things worse, he tries to rap like a ghetto thug and you actually scream: ""No!"". Then he and his silly sister use cameras throughout the movie. See, the director has dived into the long discredited and hated ""found footage"" and ""shaky camera"" style of mind-numbing boredom.

Then, after the two kids understand these old people are actually lunatics, the grandma asks the girl for a second time to clean the oven. Idiot girl eagerly complies and the mad woman slams the oven door onher--but then releases her. I lost the thread of this increasingly grotesque excursion into madness and stupidity.

The first thing that is striking that how he has accomplished  a fantastic job of making unknown actors play superbly.

Of course the film does not limit itself to it.  A good suspense, wonderful photography, nicely distilled tension makes it one of the exciting thrillers to watch.

7427092,1,B0152AVXUI,"This movie was absolutely awful.  I was unaware that the entire movie was shot in a ""documentary"" style view (which at times makes me dizzy or sick to my stomach), and the story was pure garbage.

**WARNING: May contain spoilers**
I had wanted to watch this show for quite a while and wish I had never seen it at this point.  I am disappointed to say I spent time and money on it, and would advise anyone who may want to watch this show to rethink it and not.  The story is about two kids (Becca and Tyler) who had never met their grandparents (their mothers parents) before.  When their mother was 19 years old, she ran off and married a man that the parents did not approve of.  But now, with Becca being 15 and Tyler being 13, the grandparents found the mother via the internet (fingers crossed it was Facebook) and asked for the grandkids to spend a week with them.  The mother, after 14 or 15 years of so much as not even SPEAKING to the parents, allowed this.  OKAY, let's just start with this.  The idea that this would have ever happened is about 0%, but hey.  Mom wanted a week off to go on a cruise with her boyfriend.  So she allowed this.  When the kids first arrive at the grandparents house, things seemed fairly normal, but they were advised to stay away from the basement due to black mold, and that bedtime was at 9:30pm.  BUT LISTEN TO THIS NEXT PART.  2/3 of the way into the movie (you see the grandparents do a bunch of wacky stuff, like keep soiled diapers in a shed, run around like goblins at night and scratch door frames in the nude), they connect with the mother via Skype and the kids find out that the crazies that they've been staying with AREN'T THEIR GRANDPARENTS.  Say what?  No, they're actually mental patients from the hospital that the ACTUAL grandparents volunteered at.  Okay, so you haven't met these people before, but you mean to tell me you haven't even seen a PHOTO of them?  You didn't think to ASK to see what they looked like before hopping on a train?  COME.  ON.  Oh, and at the end, you finally get to see the grandparents.  Dead, in the basement.  CAN WE TAKE A MINUTE ON THIS, TOO?  You mean to tell me that grandma and grandpa have been decaying for a week and you couldn't smell that?  Seriously?

Do yourself a favor.  Do not watch this.  I wish I hadn't.",1458345600,3,2310,4.309302325581395

7427096,2,B0152AVXUI,"M. Night Shyamalan seems to like the shaggy-dog story. For those who don't know, a shaggy-dog story is a story that excites enough interest to keep people listening (or, in the case of a movie, watching) and leads to a terrible punchline. At least three of Shyamalan's films follow the same basic path: a story with at least something to recommend it and a twist ending. This formula worked in The Sixth Sense but not in The Village.

Here, it doesn't work.

Two teenagers are sent by their single mother to stay with their grandparents for a week. During the visit, the grandparents exhibit strange, even alarming, behavior. But with their mother gone, there isn't much the children can do as the behavior becomes more and more outlandish and even a bit threatening. I won't reveal the punchline/twist, but it hardly seemed worth the effort to me. And the fact that the young girl films nearly everything only made the film seem like another on the seemingly endless pile of found-footage films.",1458345600,2,996,4.784883720930233

Becca uses this opportunity to make a documentary about the relationship between her mother and grandparents. After a few days there grandparents strange and creepy activity begin to make Becca and Tyler very uneasy.

I really enjoyed it. Full of suspense, thrills, interesting characters, creepy scenes, and even some good laughs. I think most of the bad reviews came from the fact that M.Knight directed it.

7427114,3,B0152AVXUI,"Oh I waited and waited to see this and I was not disappointed

I watched the trailer and thought oh cool, as I love scary, edge of your seat movies. I bought the digital version and watched it carefully.
M. Night Shyamalan did not let me down!
I do not want to give away too much but give you a taste:

2 children area allowed to go visit their grandparents that they have never met. Their mother had left when she was young after a fight over her boyfriend (soon to be husband ) took place.
Years later the kids go to visit and although things seem OK at first and a lot of their strange behavior is believed to just be part of growing old...soon They discover there is more to grandma and grandpa..( I do not want to give away too much there)

Points of interest: There are a lot of references to other movies made, and if you are like me a movie freak, you will catch them. If you use the digital download and stream it, Amazon offers links and snippets of FYI as the movie goes.

This was (Olivia DeJonge) Becca's first time in a major role, not sure if she really ever acted before in anything. But I know M. Night Shyamalan said she was his star when he first met her.

Con: There is a lot of humor in the film and not all of it really adds to the mood. I understand trying to keep it lighter but at some points it sort of  took away the immersion of the film's feeling.
Some continuity issues with weather but then again I am sort of a stickler for details.
While I understand her letting her kids go to the grandparents I can not imagine not checking with them to make sure they made it and things were ok, (the grandparents). As a mother I would never send my children anywhere without dotting every I and crossing every T.
I was left with a few questions but I can live with them I suppose.

Pros: Not all the best scenes were not in the trailer. Some of the scenes shown in trailer were not what I suspected. There was a twist I was not expecting and as an avid movie freak that is always a plus.

Over all I enjoyed it and can over look the few annoying things. Normally I would buy a disk so I could watch it over but I think this one once is enough not much to discover that I have not already seen in the first viewing.

Not his best film but I appreciated what he tried to bring to the screen and I was entertained- So 3 stars from me

Plenty of other reviews have pointed out the serious logic flaws in this movie, so I won't bring up MY objections--and their accompanying spoilers. All I can say is that throughout this movie, I kept thinking to myself, ""Why on earth would ANYONE do that in this situation?"" Just let me say, if I had been the grand-kids, this would have been a 20 minute movie. That's how long it would have taken me to figure out something was SERIOUSLY wrong with Grand Ma and Grand Pa. and got the hell out of there. But, nooooo, these stupid kids keep going back for more.

7427222,4,B0152AVXUI,"The Visit may have a few ""as if that would happen"" or ""why didn't they"" moments, was predictable and the ending wasn't well done, but for me a great movie is one that is fun and entertains you throughout the whole film, is a DVD you'd highly recommend to others and is one that when those others see it, you want to discuss it with them.  The Visit achieves all those factors.  Great movies also has a lot of memorable lines and scenes, ""So I Hear You Don't Like Germs,"" ""I Was Just Cleaning it!"" ""Climb Right into the Oven, All the Way to the Back"" are just three great ones. Also a rarity for the hand held camera genre, as well as child actors as the lead character films, The Visit has well known actors who you instantly recognise from other other DVDs and actors that can actually act.  Tyler, the boy (Ed Oxenbould) was the main character in Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Becca (Olivia DeJonge) was the daughter in the witness protection family TV show Hiding.  Even the minor role of the mother (Kathryn Hahn) was the annoying RV couple wife from We're the Millers. Nana and Pop Pop are also well played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie.  The basic plot of this one is a mother who ran away from her parents due to an incident when a teen who hasn't seen them for 15 years. Those parents get in contact with her on social media wanting to see their grandkids, the grandkids find out and convince their mother to let them go as a present to her so she can take a vacation on a cruise ship with her current boyfriend while they spend a week at their rural farm. The older child Becca, has plans to make a documentary on the visit, as well as secret plans to try and convince them to forgive her mother, although she doesn't know what her mother did as she won't tell her. The younger brother also likes to film everything he does. We experience everything throughout the movie through those two lenses.  When the kids meet their grandparents, to say they are odd, would be an understatement.  But are they a danger to them as well?

Spoilers follow - The film was a little predictable, you did know what was going on pretty early on, there are a lot of clues if you missed earlier ones but I don't know that the viewer needs to be blindsided by a twist when the main characters learn of it to be good.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending, as it was just your usual B grade thriller ending.  A better ending instead of the usual fight to survive scene would have been for them to have arrived home, Becca to have either shown some of the footage or gone and finished editing together the documentary (one we are watching) and the last words of the film to be the mother looking at the screen with the documentary at the point where they meet at the train station, a terrified and shocked look on her face and she says ""These aren't my parents, they aren't you're grandparents!""

I did of course also wonder how being tech savvy kids, they wouldn't have researched online their grandparents once they had decided they were going to stay.  Since the real grandparents were on social media, it would be odd that they didn't at least have a profile picture on Facebook or whatever they were on.  Or that their Facebook Friends didn't have one photo of them tagged in  it.  But then again maybe they just created the account to communicate with their daughter and beg to see  the kids and perhaps the library or someone helped them to do that so they never bothered with images.  Also I would have thought the children would have uploaded bits of their filming or at least stills from it of their grandparents when they did weird stuff on their own social media pages for laughs to their friends to see (which you imagine their mother would have been one of their friends).  Especially when the laptops camera was covered in cooking batter.  Unless the kids were home schooled and didn't have any friends maybe.

Still as I said you can find holes in this storyline but when a film is this much fun that simply doesn't matter.  Highly recommend The Visit.",1457136000,,4099,4.409814323607427

7427234,1,B0152AVXUI,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Visit""

1. M. Night Shyamalan is back again with one of the worst films of 2015. It's also one of Shyamalan's best films.

2. This is Shyamalan's attempt at found-footage horror. Or comedy. Or drama. Or something. I didn't laugh or get scared at the right times, so I'm not sure what the intended effect was.

3. It's about 2 precocious kids who go to visit their grandparents for the first time, because their mother hasn't talked to them for about 15 years. The girl, named Rebecca, wants to be some kind of tween Barbara Walters and interview their grandparents while documenting the week.

4. Immediately the grandparents start acting weird and suspicious and cheerful all at the same time. I admit that Deanna Dunigan and Peter McRobbie do give creepy performances here. The problem is that the old folks' increasingly erratic and threatening behavior has no real pattern, nor it doesn't give any clues as to what's going on. They just randomly do weird things.

5. The movie commits all the usual found-footage errors - cameras that are held at improbable angles at improbable times, with an ambient soundtrack in the background and sudden bass-heavy stereo musical stings. I've never seen a camera that comes with its own soundtracks and personalized bass levels.

6. Randomly, the kids also decide to interview each other. This is to set up a backstory for how they will act during the climax of the film. But it really is just a cover up for a sloppy script. By the way, the kids are really annoying and I kinda hoped they would get killed.

7. Shyamalan is known for providing audiences with twist endings. And he tries it here, too. But again, it's sloppy and completely unsatisfying. I rolled my eyes so hard at the ""scariest"" part of the film that I think I hurt myself.

8. There are some individually creepy moments in this movie. But they don't add up to anything coherent, and by the time I knew what was going on, I didn't really care anymore.

9. There is supposed to be a moral to this story - it's not a good idea to hang on to anger when people hurt you. But the only message I got out of it is to make sure your parents aren't lunatics when you send your kids to visit.",1457136000,2,2225,4.528678304239402

Night and his altogether reputation in the film industry have drastically changed since the days of ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"".

Personally, I was never one for  these new age ""found footage"" films like the Paranor Activity movie series, but The Visit makes it work extremely well along with the good writing and overall terrific acting on the part of the cast. It has a tasteful nature that in my humble opinion, has been extremely lacking in not just horror films, but all films made of recent date.

If there's a director who needs to retire immediately, this is the one. From now on, when I see his name on a project, I will steer clear. Should have known better, but the reactions to the movie were mixed, so I gave it a chance.

The Visit is a PG-13 thriller whose trailer made it seem more like a black comedy in some ways; and it's essentially nothing more than a good deal of potential. I would say ""Don't waste your time"" on this movie to anyone curious about watching it. The story hinges strongly on a very simple twist/revelation that appears about 7/8 into the movie (hey, we've been down that road before with this guy, haven't we). Once I had endured over an hour of nothing-to-write-home-about, I didn't much care about any sinister plot point. I just wanted this experience to end.

Man, what a squandered opportunity for a fright flick. You have two teen siblings visiting the old grandparents, out at a secluded and picturesque old farm, in winter. And the girl is making a video diary/project of the week. In the right hands, this scenario would have worked very nicely in a scary film.

In The Visit, Shyamalan occasionally uses big red lettering superimposed on the screen a few times (TUESDAY MORNING, etc), which reminds one of Stanley Kubrick's horror masterpiece The Shining-- a piece of macabre moviemaking from 36 years ago that's definitely worthwhile.

I should have gone with my gut feeling on this Shyamalan movie and not even bothered.",1455926400,5,1481,4.724806201550388

The entire film is based on a completely unbelievable premise. Woman leaves home at 19 to get married to a guy who her parents disapprove of. Years later they get divorced. Her parents find her online, contact her and tell her they want to meet the grandkids. Sounds good so far except mom, who hasn't even spoken to them in 10+ years, packs her two kids up and sends them off to the abusive parents that even she refuses to speak to. One would think the mom would go with to verify it's actually her parents but noooo. Instead the irresponsible slob boards a cruise ship with her current boyfriend and sends her underage kids off to her parents house unattended. WHAT PARENT WOULD DO THIS? Turns out the grandparents have been murdered by mental institution escapees and that's who her kids were spending time with. The mom finally gets a good look at them via webcam and realizes...oops....that's not your grandparents. The kids are attacked, overcome, escape and here comes mommy with the cops to take them home. There really should be a sequel to this showing the neglectful mom going to prison and the kids packed off to foster care. Speaking of the two brats. Child actors can either make or break a film and these two, the boy especially breaks this film beyond repair. He spends a good chunk of the film trying and failing to rap. I was hoping granny would have shoved him in the oven and cooked him.
M Night has had more chances than most to have continued success. He has failed, yet again.

7427484,4,B0152AVXUI,"When you begin your career with a movie like The Sixth Sense, so much is expected of you. When your films start to decline, and then not do well at all, its easy for people to lose faith in your talents. Ill admit, after The Village, I thought Shyamalan may have run out of things I would enjoy watching. I am happy that The Visit has restored my opinion of his movies. Hopefully he can keep it up!

Shyamalan did an excellent job of keeping the tension going throughout the movie. Weird things start happening the first night, and at first its easy for the grandparents to just say its old age. But after a few days, both of the kids really start to question it. The sister can still justify things, but the brother starts to get really creeped out.

When I saw the previews I thought this was going to be a found footage film, and those are one of my least favorite type of movies. So I was happy to find out it wasnt. The sister is making a documentary, so there are times when we are seeing the scene through the camera lens, but it really works for this film. Besides the amateur camera work, the camera angles in the film really help with capturing the tension.

Often I figure out the twist in a book or movie, well before the ending, but not in this case. Because of that, it made this movie even more enjoyable to me. I figured it out about a minute before the brother and sister did, so Shyamalan did a marvelous job in the script writing. Oh, and the one scene at the end (youll know which one), really, really grossed me out. But that just added another element to this movie to make it even more enjoyable.

7427560,1,B0152AVXUI,"This movie sucks. Plain and simple. Before I get into this garbled mess I'd like to point out that I've only seen one M. Night film, that being Signs. And I found it to be just OK. I went into The Visit with literally zero expectations. The trailers didn't give me enough to form an opinion one-way or the other. I had no preconceived notions about the film or the director; I went into this completely cold.

Two kids, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) go spend a week at their grandparent's (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) place. Their mom (Kathryn Hahn) had a falling out with her parents at a very young age, so Becca and Tyler have never met them. This basic premise leads to various jump scares and unintentionally hilarious points of terrible dialogue, acting, and overall stupidity.

At it's core, The Visit, could have been an interesting horror flick about dementia and old age. However it just ends up being a dull and uninteresting horror. From the onset we can tell something's not right with the grandparents. They act very peculiar from the first time we meet them until the very end. No subtlety to the performances and it's clear their nuts from the very beginning. There's no slow build to anything because we've already seen so much. By the end, when we're suppose to be truly scared for the kids the audience is just tired from the prior 80 minutes of film.

But nothing seems to register with these kids. Tyler starts to question their behavior but not before he's already seen some truly odd things that would make any kid question the situation. A big problem with this film is how unbelievable these kids are. Becca is annoying and is written way too smart for a kid her age. Not to mention the actress, Olivia DeJonge, can't act for anything. Ed is a written as if M. Night has never even met a thirteen year old. The moments when we are forced to learn a little bit more about these kids are just uninteresting and painfully heavy handed.

M. Night is trying so hard to get his message across that when it finally hits, it done right painful to watch. It's so heavy handed and over the top it hurts. I would recommend this to people as an unintentional comedy, but the humor doesn't come nearly enough to warrant somebody sit through this mindless wretch of a film.

No, not this mom....I'm sure everything will be just fine - I have done such a great job raising these delightful little brats, they are just going to have the best time, you know trying not to be killed, avoiding adult diaper products in the face, the dark- darkies- you know all the stuff that grandparents do.

Please DON'T seriously.

Even 14$ is too much for this s!?$.

One of the worst movies with no coherence or logic or reason whatsoever .

The children will make you reconsider having them if you don't already have them.

There was a twist I didn't expect but when I look back on it now I can't believe how stupid I was to not see that which also made this movie absolutely pointless.

Rent don't buy and after I watched this I was very grateful that I didn't buy it .

Heed the warning it's a stupid movie and M Knight Shamalamadingdong really needs to go back to the drawing board in order to actually understand what horror actually is and represents.",1455494400,,749,4.384057971014493

7427615,5,B0152AVXUI,"The disjointed unpredictability of the way this film-within-a-film is shot, really captures the terrifying reality of being with people whose thinking may have gone tilt. The allusions to Grimms tale of Hansel and Gretel are obvious from the start, but the modern, high-tech context and the way the action plays out make this a story of its own. Its a unique and brilliant rendering of the old theme of children sent into the woods to live with strangers.

Part of my fear was generated from the fact that I really cared about what happened to the young protagonists in this film. They are at the other end of the spectrum from the grunting, clueless teens and pre-teens shown in a lot of films. These youngsters are compellingly verbal, with astonishing vocabularies. How many youngsters do you hear knowledgeably talking about a mise en scene? I enjoyed being let in on the conversation between this brother and sister and wanted to hear more. Along the way, I also added the term sundowning to my vocabulary  as it turns out, a very real syndrome.

I also appreciated the way the two young people generally supported each other in a you and me against the world way  rather than undercutting each other with foul-mouthed one-liners.

We all know people who are a little nuts. Were vaguely unsettled with worries about how far their craziness might actually carry them. This movie plays on that kind of fear, with suspenseful, scary results.",1455408000,2,1443,4.825910931174089

7427627,2,B0152AVXUI,This movie was not a horror movie. If you aren't scared of old people it isn't scary. There are some funny moments and some tense moments but I would classify this more as a weird thriller than a horror.,1455235200,,203,4.230769230769231
7427628,3,B0152AVXUI,"Great idea that fails.  The movie has a nice twist you might not see coming.  But M. Night ruins it, as usual.  The ending is absolutely terrible.  Additionally, there was NO NEED to tell the story through cameras held by precocious children.  The story would have worked well if the movie had been shot normally.  So, yes, the ""camera"" footage gets annoying.  Especially in the end.  There are points at which you feel like someone is running away with your TV or putting it under a blanket.  Let's stop this handheld camera bull.

Which is a shame, because the movie really is creepy and tense for the most part.  Basically, I'd recommend watching it until the secret is revealed and someone literally gets poop in his/her face.  Then shut it off and go watch Big Bang Theory, or whatever floats your boat.  It's down hill from that point on.

Also, the little boy raps way too much.  Yes, I said ""raps"".  He literally ends the movie with a RAP.  Worse--he is horrible at it.  I have never wanted to spit on a TV screen more than when his inane rhymes bust out.  (I just gagged)

On the plus side, the sister is an excellent protagonist.  Great actor.  And the grandparents are WEIRD AS HELL.  So watching this movie is not a terrible experience.  I liked the awkward and scary scenes--like the sudden game of hide and seek.  I was scarred by that one.

This is not a spoof movie nor is there any added comical scenes, this is a creeped out story with a fantastic twist at the end. Like any scary movie, you have put yourself in the shoes. If you put yourself in the shoes of these 2 youg kids and imagine them going through these things and imagine this could actually happen...its very very creepy.

M.Night's great movies wrapped up all the small details, including the critical back stories, and the situations were always resolved in a somewhat unorthodox fashion.

At one point I thought it would be a ""Alien Invasion"" thing but it wasn't any of the that. Just a crazy old man and women pretending to be grandparents for theses kids. I did not like kid actors not one of them knows how to act. They where so blended and seemed bored of the whole movie. The main story was okay I guess. The daughter is trying to reunite her mother with her parents. Though that seemed like a side mission. The other is the kids are a little messed up after there father left them and his wife for another women. The girl can't look in mirrors and the brother is a germophobia. And of corse they face their problems in the end but not in the way that allows the audiences to believe that they have change at all. The boy gets rubbed with poop on his face. And there girl looks in the mirror to watch out for granny. Go figure. Also the boy raps. Very poorly. In fact Its the worse rap I've ever heard.

There are good elements. The older actors play their part fine. The place that it takes place is pretty and creepy at the same time. The story if the movie had concentrate on it would have been great. The rest was so bland. The jump scares (if any) were like lame and slow.

The movie is pretty uneventful until the big reveal, but if you've  been paying attention to the dialog you'll figure it out long before the movie is even close to the end.

7427783,5,B0152AVXUI,"M. Night Shyamalan at his best. This movie has it all.

This is the kind of movie that you can watch with your teenagers, without embarrassment. It is a horror film, but not in the classic sense. Rather, in the way that only M.Night Shyamalan can make them. The characters are relatable, and friendly. They are well defined, but still have a little mystery about them.

The story builds slowly and instead of using shock and gore, the mystery and intensity is heightened with bursts of fear inducing behaviors. With every turn, the story explains itself and is rationalized. Surprisingly, there are moments of complete hilarity that are catchy, and will have you repeating them for days to come.

And always, the end of this movie is completely unexpected. Just when you think you have it all figured out, here comes another twist that will make you say- Of COURSE!

I was very happy with this movie. It is probably one of the best movies that I have watched with my kids in a long time. It is nice to not have to fast forward through porn, and instead just sit back and enjoy the show!",1454284800,5,1086,4.525510204081633

7427842,2,B0152AVXUI,"I had hopes of a smart and slick thriller from M. Night Shyamalan. What I got was a rather disgusting, disturbing and quite predictable film. The Visit presents us a film about a brother and a sister, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her younger brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) who want to visit their estranged grandparents against their mother's (Kathryn Hahn) wishes. This is where the film starts to take a series of weird turns. First, their mother takes advantage of this and goes away with her new boyfriend. The daughter, Becca, a budding filmmaker decides to film the whole experience and help her mother heal from the way she left home years ago. The grandparents, Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) and Nana (Deanna Dunagan) are just weird and bizarre. Reasons are given but they make no sense. There are overtones of a pale Psycho imitation here but these characters are just horrible people. There are hints that something is not quite with this set-up. There are chills but the pay-off is hurt by incongruent scenes. I was more horrified at the level of disdain that the movie had for the elderly and the vulgarity of acts. The film sputters to an ending much to my relief. I cannot recommend this for younger viewers in spite of the teenagers.",1454025600,,1240,4.74537037037037

This movie is one that I allowed my young teenage daughter to see, after seeing it first myself.  I am a huge fan of M.Night Shaymalan movies, and this one didn't disappoint.  It has some disturbing scenes that are accompanied with a little humor, and it works!  My daughter loved the movie and some of the characters in it, so we bought it when it was released on DVD.  Although this isn't the typical scary movie, it was still exciting and fun to watch.  It might not be exciting enough for most violent thriller fans, but I found it to be a balanced scary movie for younger teens. We've watched it several times.",1454025600,,782,4.433566433566433

And there is absolutely no way the 5 star reviews are legitimate. I guess even studio execs know how to try to recoup funds when they end up with a stinker like this.

Honestly, I'm a reasonable person. I love good movies, in particular, I love horror and suspense. This was neither. Another hackneyed POV film as unprobable as every other movie that came before it (and as cliche).

Trust me: do not waste your time or money. Not even out of curiosity. Look at these reviews again...see how there are more 1 star reviews than 5 star? That means the truth is getting out.

Or maybe they're just sick of kicking him around. Despite the ridiculous handheld-camera gimmick, this one builds some real suspense and some creepiness.

Probably not, as this flick didn't do all that great as far as horror movies go in the box office.

7428132,1,B0152AVXUI,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. First off, as a ""found-footage"" type of movie, it's already at a disadvantage.  For me, the problem with found-footage movies is that at some point (fairly early on), it's no longer believable that the person with the video camera would keep filming.  I'm sorry, but if I'm being chased by someone or something, I'm not going to turn the camera around to film myself and show everyone how scared I am.  Second, the kids in the movie are just not very likable.  The little boy was okay, although I rolled my eyes at his rapping.  His older sister, however, was completely annoying.  By the end of the movie, I wanted the kids to die as much as the grandparents.  Not to mention that I didn't find the movie scary at all.  Overall, this was one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile.  Because of M. Night Shyamalan's recent track record, I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie.  In fact, I only watched it because it got decent reviews. Even with my low expectations, I still ended up feeling like I'd wasted 2 hours of my life watching this drivel.

7428153,4,B0152AVXUI,"The Visit,"" a thriller from director M. Night Shyamalan, uses the found footage approach to tell the story of aspiring teenage filmmaker Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her twelve-year-old brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), who are about to spend a week with grandparents they have never met. This is because their mother (Kathryn Hahn) had a fight with them when she was 19 and hasn't spoken to them since. Through some online detective work, the parents have found her and are eager to get to know their grandchildren.

Becca and Tyler are enthusiastic about the idea, figuring they may be able to mend fences between their mother and her parents, and readily agree to a week-long visit at their remote farmhouse. Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) are very strange in their ways and demand that the kids not leave their room after 9:30 P.M. Naturally, this rule will be broken. When Becca sneaks downstairs for a snack, she sees Nana walking across the room, vomiting every few steps. Later, Becca discovers that Pop Pop has his own bizarre set of stomach-turning habits.

As their stay progresses, things become increasingly odd. The kids regard a lot of what they witness as either dementia or, worse, mental illness, but decide to stick it out, with only a few Skype communications home. Their mom seems more dismissive of her parents behavior than a concerned parent should be. The sister and brother do foolish things and go where they shouldnt, moving the story forward at the expense of the characters IQs. Still, the film is pretty scary, with Ms. Dunagan chewing up the scenery in a role thats impossible to overplay.

Shyamalan uses an excessive amount of shaky camerawork to suggest a novice filmmakers footage, though one would think an early lesson in effective camera technique for a budding filmmaker would be keeping it steady. There are a number of shocks, both the quick, sudden kind and those created with suspenseful build-up. The director provides an appropriately creepy milieu and a pair of relatives that could easily be close kin of Norman Bates mother. Though The Visit doesnt come up to the level of The Sixth Sense or Signs, it is nonetheless a textbook example of audience manipulation. Known for his secret twists, Shyamalan doesnt disappoint in this Hansel-and-Gretel-inspired scare flick.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a making-of featurette, deleted scenes, alternate ending, and Beccas photos. A digital HD copy is enclosed.",1453420800,,2497,5.038740920096853

7428159,5,B0152AVXUI,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

It wasn't all that long ago when an unknown director by the name of M. Night Shyamalan became the go to guy for horror after the release of THE SIXTH SENSE. Since that time hes directed many more films that have been praised or demonized but that have never been boring. With the release of THE VISIT Shyamalan once again returns to his horror roots and does so with a vengeance.

The film opens with a young mother played by Kathryn Hahn about to send her two children, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould), to spend the week with her parents. The occasion is a mending of sorts since she hasn't seen nor spoken to her parents in over 15 years, their parting a fight that was never settled. The man she left for has abandoned her and the children, her parents were proven right and now theyve reached out to her over the internet to try and mend fences. Mom is off to a cruise with her new boyfriend and the kids are off to meet the grandparents for the first time.

All of this is being shot by budding film maker Becca. Yes, this is one of those point of view films Im not fond of but here it works. The trip by train to their grandparents house gives us a chance to see just who Becca and Tyler are. When they arrive they find their grandparents waiting, sign in hand to be recognized, and off they go.

Things seem to be going smoothly until night time. A noise outside their room prompts the kids to open the door to see whats going on. Its the first sign that something isn't right as they see grandma running around on all fours. The next day they are told by grandpa that she has episodes and that it would be best for them to not open the door after their 9PM bed time.

The days pass, the kids stay in touch with mom via skype on their laptop and more odd things happen. With each one the viewer begins to wonder of these grandparents are slowly devolving into insanity or if its just old age catching up with them. Then again perhaps its just that they're not used to having kids around. As the story moves forward Becca continues to film their daily events as does Tyler with Beccas back up camera. With each item they film, as different odd things begin to happen, both children begin to wonder if they are safe or not. By the time they make the decision of what to do it may be too late.

One thing about a Shyamalan movie is that in describing it you find yourself at odds about just how much to give away. Hes great at surprises and twisting even those surprises into something you don't expect. Trailers for this film made it obvious that something wrong was at play here but just what is it? What could be the big secret here? Are the adults going insane? Is it just the grandparents or is it this area? Are they creatures, monsters, vampires? Or are they just getting old?

All is answered by the end of the film and in the most satisfying of ways possible. Its not so much the answer that makes this film as interesting and scary as it is but the trip the viewer travels to get to that point. When the kids are talking into the camera you're on edge wondering if someone is going to come up behind them while they speak. Youre never quite sure where the safe places are in the house when they travel from room to room. When grandma talks about aliens as Becca interviews her you start to wonder could she be one or is she just losing her mind? The guessing game begins when the kids arrive and doesnt stop until the end.

The two young actors featured here make this movie work extremely well. Beccas attempt to be a film maker set up the point of view documentation of what is going on work as opposed to any number of found footage films that haven't done so. The combination of childish spying, youngsters interviewing their grandparents and horsing around for the camera make it all seem natural. When it is eventually used to help light the way it makes it scarier still. But the only way to make these two young actors believable is to have them met by the adults in the film as well. Deanna Dunagan as Nana and Peter McRobbie as Pop Pop match the children in what seems like a harmless older couple that turns into someone they kids are unsure of when it comes to safety.

This movie works on all levels and having watched it twice now I can attest to the creepiness factor on display here. Even knowing what is coming the movie still has you jump when those times come and cringe as things happen you know are on the way. Your skin crawls, you find yourself screaming at the screen for the children to be careful and you hope for the best until the credits roll. Before that happens the emotional levels you feel will rise and fall and once again M. Night Shyamalan will be hailed as someone who knows what the word horror means.",1453334400,,4825,4.293406593406593

Low-budget, boring, uninteresting, not at all believable.  The Village was his best movie.  The only good scene in The Visit is where the mom tells the daughter ""Don't hang onto anger.  You hear me?""  M. Knight loves hangman's nooses, basements, sheds.  These are all potentially powerful elements but he bastardized ALL possible horror elements that might give one a good startle.  I actually scrolled way ahead through the movie because I couldn't bear to waste 1.5 hours of my life watching this dreck.  It was a heck of a lot more stimulating to write a scathing review.  M.

Yes, it creeped me out.  Was it funny?  Yes, it had some funny moments in it as well.  The only thing that bugged the living daylights out of me was the 1st person/2nd person POV.

M. Night Shyamalan's The visit is one of the greatest psychological thrillers( Not horror in my opinion) ever made. I noticed that most of the negative reviews come from people who streamed the movie, and the positive reviews were people like myself who own the Blu ray.

Alas...I hung on until the (nearly) bitter end (more later) to see if this once interesting film maker had a trick up his sleeve. But no, it wasn't to be. The ending, which was telegraphed ten minutes in, came right one schedule.

The most horrifying part of the film was the prepubescent Vanilla Ice. Warning! Avoid the last five minutes of this movie if you're on the fence about having kids. Or maybe you should watch it.",1452816000,,751,4.357142857142857

I don't feel like going into specifics to spoil any of the story for anyone who may enjoy it. I know my glowing review already did? Yeah, yeah. On the positive side, I didn't find anything wrong with the acting and you certainly could see much of Night's familiar style but it just totally failed to deliver a complete story.

My 15yr old saw this one in the theater and told us it was funny..?  He has some strange takes on movies and we new it was a horror but he didn't really describe it that way and I wouldn't either.  We rented it not really sure what to expect after his vague review and explanation that ended with ""..you just have to see it to understand..?"" and now I do.

The main themes have some very scary points to them especially for parents, including some that become very touching and sad.  There are several scenes that are creepy and jumpy and for the most part the movie is in your head.  The main characters are mostly believable but the support characters are a little over acted.  The build up strays a little with strange reoccurring plot hints that do not really develop the suspense and in the end added to the predictable ending.  It's the oddities of the behavior that wrap it all back together into an enjoyable flick.

This is one of the most believable self shot horrors I have seen since Blair Witch. Great story and characters with fun surprises along the way.  Even though the twist starts to become predictable near the ending it is not a letdown by any means.

I also didn't know he would shoot this movie Blair Witch style either and that made it even worse.  The camera isn't as shaky as The Blair Witch Project, but there's a few scenes that are.  The one part of this movie I did like was seeing Olivia DeJonge do a great acting job.  I haven't seen her before, but she's definitely a good actress I will be looking for now.

A few creepy scenes here and there with the grandma running around at night, and yelling into the camera during the scene where she was walking around at night after the kids set up the camera to capture her, ""strange moments."" Unfortunately, someone told me the plot before I purchased this DVD, so I knew what to expect. Despite the spoiler, I still enjoyed it. A couple of dumb parts prevented me from giving this a 5 star rating. One being how the kids had never even seen a picture of their grandparents. I mean, the mom hadn't spoken or seen them in 15 years, but she gets a new boyfriend and sends the kids to visit the same parents that she refused to see, all so that she can whoop it up in the Caribbean? Pretty strange. Then there's the boy who wanted to be a rapper. LOL I say, stay in school kiddo. Rapping is NOT your forte. Overall, the movie was decent, but I wish they would have given us a little more background on who this elderly couple was, and how/when they decided to assume to role of the grandparents. The audience was simply left to assume that these were mental patients at a hospital the real grandparents worked at. Why did they kill the grandparents?

Then a slew of cinematic disasters followed culminating in a near career-ending tragedy with his horrifyingly sub-par live-action adaptation of an animated Nickelodeon series; which will remain nameless so we all may forget.  So, when I became aware of the hype regarding this indie horror flick directed by Mr. Shyamalan, I was slightly intrigued but expected nothing less than the current legacy he has defecated all over the silver screen.  I was only minorly surprised to discover that this isn't a bad flick, nor is it particularly good, just somewhere in between. With a now overused novelty, POV filming, a decently written script, and a mixed bag of both authentic and stale performances, this picture never meets its full potential but strangely achieves an effective eeriness and a solid ""twist"" (said in Robot Chicken's Shyamalan fashion) by credits end.  Although much of the suspense feels forced, I found the journey to its somewhat terrifying conclusion quite well done.  The humor is annoyingly clichd and M.Night might want to brush up on what is current, as some of his pop culture references are outdated considering his young cast.  Overall, it's worth the cost of Red Box but maybe not an Amazon rental.  This might be the first step in a very long way back for a director who, for one brief moment, could have revolutionized modern cinema.",1452556800,3,1509,4.917322834645669

The genre of found footage has really gone downhill, if you ask me, it hit it's high point with the the first Paranormal Activity movie and it's been one flop bigger than the last after that one.  I wanted to see this movie because I actually think the director has talent and I read a lot of good reviews about this movie.  Well frankly I think those reviews were over hyping the film

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Okay so this movie is about 2 kids who have never seen their maternal grandparents before, and decide out of the blue that they want to go visit them and make a documentary about their visit.  When they get there, the grandparents are a little kooky and they have little things about them that a normal person would think are a little odd, but when it's your grandparents, you forgive that because you love them.  As the week goes on, they start acting stranger and stranger, especially at night.  The grandmother acts completely off her rocker at 9:30 and stays that way until the sun comes up.

Well as it turns out, the two old people aren't their grandparents but are from the local insane asylum (Let's call it what it is, okay people?) where the real grandparents volunteered as counselors a few days a week.  The fake grandparents were patients there who killed the real grandparents and took their place because they wanted to have a normal week with some grandchildren.

In the end the fake grandparents (I can't remember their real names), can't keep up the charade anymore and go crazy and are about to kill the kids, but the kids go into survival mode and kill the fake grandparents instead.  The mom shows up with the police and they take the the kids home where they are safe.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

All in all, it's got a twist that isn't bad but if you have half a brain in your head, you can see it coming from a mile away the minute they said they volunteer as counselors.  Also the best part of the movie is during the credits where the brother, who is a wannabe rapper, is rapping about the events of the movie we just watched.  I have to admit that part made me laugh out loud!  So if you like found footage movies this one isn't terrible but it's also not terrific.  It's worth renting for a few dollars, but I am glad I didn't spend $10.00 to see it in the theater.",1452556800,,2462,4.473094170403588

Is it a ""return to form"" as other reviewers have claimed? I would argue no; it in no way compares to Unbreakable, which is really its only analog, considering the emotional tone it often tries to strike (a tone that is occasionally effective). Is it a bad movie? Again, I would argue no. Then again, it's not terribly original. I think that this movie is worth a watch: the acting is solid (though the young woman's intellectual affect wears thin, much in the vein of Juno, and the rapping...sigh), and there are some effective moments, both tender and startling.

Knight cues and clues. Those are just as important as the acting. For example, the kids are out in the yard having a good time but  there are an unusual number of red things in the scene. Knowing M. Knight as well as I do, those scene are creepy because something bad is going to happen. That's why M. Knight as a fan base, a group of us that watch all his films.

There was some truly excellent character development in getting to know the two children who serve as the protagonists spending a week with the maternal grandparents they had never known...enough so that they are highly sympathetic as the whole experience goes about as sideways as it conceivably could.
Shyamalan manages to pull off a twist that doesn't feel contrived or forced when it hits in the third act, and it is one hell of a twist.

I believe that the best horror, thriller & science fiction films are those with stories that start out perfectly ordinary, with characters leading relatively normal lives, possibly fraught with disfunction yet normal nonetheless. Enter slowly, bizarre elements which take the viewer from ""La-dee-da"" normalcy into a different mindset ... a 'Wait a minute, what the heck is going on here' sort of questioning which leads to a more scary, frantic, 'clutch at your fellow viewer's arm' mood as more weird details are uncovered.

 this film was vile. there were obvious plot holes - what mother would send her children to stay with someone that she hasn't been in communication with in over fifteen years?  That she hasn't seen, gone to visit, etc?  the kids have no idea what their grandparents look like.

the shaky documentary style is ok, but the camera work could have been so much better if they  just used the camera properly.

  it goes from being semi spooky to all out vile and disgusting.  this is a classic case o what could have been really cool if there had been some sort of restraint in the story telling.

When the movie ended, the people sitting to the left of me talked out loud asking ""What was the point of that?"".  To their response, someone in front of me shouted ""There wasn't one.  Not a single one!""  I cannot recommend this for purchase or even spending money to rent.  I would wait until it is free on Amazon Prime!",1452384000,13,758,4.179310344827586
7428390,5,B0152AVXUI,"When I was a little boy my mother would drag my brother and I from Texas to Kansas to visit our grandmother. Her house was a Norman Rockwell illustration--it appeared nothing new had been purchased since 1955 and in that sense (and upon reflection) it was a very cute, warm little house--yet I could never shake the brooding eeriness of the place: It smelled like mothballs and sour milk and the matted piling of the green shag carpet was like creeping moss; and every time we turned onto grandma's street mom pointed to a sunken dark house a few parcels down from my grandma's and said, ""That's where the murder happened."" (Later on, I learned my grandma lived less than a mile from the BTK killer.) The point is this: visiting your grandparents can be very, very scary, and M. Night Shyamalan captures that acute, mundane terror with all its attendant ghastly humor in ""The Visit.""

Becca and Tyler (played by Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould, respectively) make a self-proclaimed documentary about a week spent with their grandparents, ""Nana"" and ""Pop Pop"" (played by Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie, respectively), two people of whom neither child has yet been acquainted due to some initially undisclosed and unspeakable filial estrangement between the children's mother (played by Kathryn Hahn) and their grandparents. In a last bid for reconciliation, Mom sends Becca and Tyler to meet and spend a week with Nana and Pop Pop while she takes a long-needed vacation with her new boyfriend.

The Visit is constructed as a ""found footage"" style movie where our three visual vantages stem from two handheld cameras operated by the children and a Skype video chat computer connection with the children's mother. M. Night Shyamalan deprecates to this ""handycam"" conceit while preserving his signature focal symmetry, foreboding soundtrack, haunting titling, beautiful set design, and crafty, layered dialogue.

This is not a ""full-immersion"" found footage movie: at no time are you expected to suspend disbelief and forget you're watching a new chapter of The Night Chronicles. And while its pacing is breathless and its plot is portentous and creepy, the bogeymen in The Visit are perhaps the most realistic and pathetic (that is, worthy of our pathos) of any yet portrayed in the horror genre. They are, as the characters say in the film, ""old people.""

I was deeply gratified by how much could be done with this otherwise frightless and suburban plot. The acting was superb: Becca's character is beautiful, captivating, and overtly mature; Tyler's character provides comic relief while maintaining a flawless portrait of a young boy whose superficial machismo hides an inner distressful anxiety. Kathryn Hahn delivers a performance as Mom second only to Toni Collette's maternal portrayal in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B004NAEH5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>.""

That brings us to the grandparents: they steal the show. Peter McRobbie's acting style is very similar to Lance Henriksen's--both actors can scare you with their smiles. Casting McRobbie in a role with as much superficial benignity as ""Pop Pop"" was masterful. Deanna Dunagan is equally well cast. Her character is less fragile and more fun than Jill Larson's haunting portrayal in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taking-of-Deborah-Logan/dp/B00OPX5CS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taking of Deborah Logan</a>"" but both actresses hit the ""scary grandma"" ball out of the park.

The twist? Of course there's a twist. It is, after all, an M. Night Shyamalan movie. But I'm not tellin'. Rent ""The Visit"" and discover it for yourself!",1452384000,7,3719,5.493006993006993

7428394,1,B0152AVXUI,"It's too bad I can't give The Visit a half of a star but boy am I glad that I rented this stupid movie instead of paying to watch it in a theater. It was supposed to be a dark comedy or horror comedy. It was neither. There were a few creepy scenes, a couple of gross scenes, and a ton of annoying scenes featuring the brother-sister duet. The movie should have included a disclaimer: Contains rap. I HATE rap. If you hate rap as much as I do, don't watch this movie. The very annoying brother raps one time too many, and it was awful. Made my ears want to rip themselves from off my head to escape. Maybe the rapping was supposed to be the horror component of the movie?

  About the movie itself: I cringed when I saw that it was another 'found footage' film. Please, no more 'found footage' films! They have become cliched. The movie didn't make much sense. The mother in the movie hadn't spoken to her parents in many years but, yet, she sends her kids to stay with them? And they had no idea what their grandparents looked like? Seriously? I just couldn't buy it. The grandparents behaved very strangely, to put it mildly, throughout the movie. If it were my grandparents, whom I had just met for the first time, I would have ruined my mom's Caribbean vacation and had her pick me up pronto. But noooo, not the annoying teens in this movie. The girl actually crawled completely into the large, Hansel and Gretel oven TWICE after her bizarre-acting grandmother told her to do it. The grandmother galloping about on all fours or crawling around like a spider was not scary. It was scary in the The Ring and in The Grudge but just plain stupid in this movie. Grandpa or ""Pop Pop"" explained that Nana was experiencing Sundowning. I thought M. Night Shyamalan just made this up but I actually looked it up. Sundowning is real and is associated with Alzheimer's. For this reason, I felt the movie was an insult to all those who have Alzheimer's and to all those who have loved ones with Alzheimer's. I can't believe M. Night Shyamalan would mock a subject that deserves understanding and compassion, hence my low rating.

  To conclude my lengthy review of this stupid and totally not funny movie: There were too many loose ends (like the murders, the escape, and the totally inept police) and the ""twist"" was not surprising at all. I had already figured it out; although, I thought aliens had to be involved because Nana kept talking about yellow-eyed creatures in a pond. In fact, the movie probably would have been better if it had been a Sci-Fi Horror. The aliens could have inhabited the grandparents and then taken over the annoying grandchildren's bodies. Anything would have been better than what I wasted my money on. I think it's time for M. Night Shyamalan to give up on film-making. I think he has run out of good ideas. His last good movie was Signs.

The movie is about the opposite of nurturing, something every good parent must possess. That's why it was so creepy.

The best thing I can say about this is that the ""found footage"" style used actually works well in this one and isn't just a gimmick like in most movies like this. Shyamalan has come a long way since the Sixth Sense and this movie doesn't really do anything to restore his luster. My kids loved it, but because they laughed so much, I'm not sure that was the goal of this movie. Overall, tried so hard to be scary but came off as a very funny comedy. I give this a B-, as a comedy.",1452038400,,1194,4.241228070175438

7428448,4,B0152AVXUI,"""The Visit"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Two children are sent to their grandparents house to spend a week with their grandparents while their single mom goes on a relaxing vacation with her boyfriend. One of the kids, Becca, decides to film a documentary about her grandparents in order to help her mom reconnect with her parents and also find out some things about her parents as well. While filming the documentary, however, Becca and her little brother, Tyler, discover a dark secret about their grandparents.

The cast led by Olivia DeJonge (as Becca) & Ed Oxenbould (as Tyler) is pretty good. The directing, story & screenplay by M. Night Shyamalan (who also produced) is pretty good.

The cinematography by Maryse Alberti is pretty good. The film editing by Luke Ciarrocchi is pretty good. The casting by Douglas Aibel is pretty good. The production design by Naaman Marshall is pretty good. The art direction by Scott Anderson, set dressings by Morgan Miller, Christine Sysko, Tom West, Dennis Madigan, Samantha Higgins is pretty good. The set decoration by Christine Wick is pretty good. The costume design by Amy Westcott is pretty good. The special effects coordinated by Kurt Wunder is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by Joseph DiValerio & Ruben Rodas is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Manny Siverio is pretty good.

This is a pretty good, well-done suspense thriller that is entertaining and interesting. M. Night Shyamalan has made one of his better films in years. Olivia DeJonge & Ed Oxenbould are solid as Becca & Tyler. This is (or was) one of the better movies of the recently done fall season and was also one of the better horror movies of last year, as well, too.",1452038400,3,1719,4.860068259385666
7428449,1,B0152AVXUI,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't waste money on this one,1452038400,,78,4.266666666666667
7428450,4,B0152AVXUI,"I'm not a big fan of found footage films.  I am even lass a fan of 13 year old white suburban boys doing rap.  Fortunately, Shyamalan has done a more than respectable job with this film.  And there are only two short scenes with the young male character rapping, so it didn't ruin the film.
In fact, I really ended up enjoying this movie.
  It starts out a little slow for me.  Mom is getting ready to send her two children, daughter Rebecca 16 and son Tyler 13, for a weeks vacation with her parents at their request.  She has not spoken to her parents for 16 years since she ran off with an older man, the children's father, who has since abandoned the family.  The mother won't tell them what happened on the last day she was with her parents, but tells her daughter that she can ask the grandparents and they can explain if they want.  The daughter want to make a documentary of the whole event, thus the found footage angle.
While at the grandparents seclude farm, which is so far out in the country there is no cell phone reception.  The grandparents, nice at first, start acting more and more oddly during the week and even stranger at night. The film gathers tension as you wonder what will happen next and what is the explanation for the odd behavior.
  One reviewer thought the film was strange because of the mix of humor and scares.  This used to be more common in thrillers.  It is called comic relief.  So if you are looking for a horror film on the order of Halloween, Saw or Friday the 13th, you won't get it here.  The film is rated PG 13 so there is not a lot of bloody violence and no gratuitous nudity.  This film is better described as a thriller than a horror film.  It is more about tension than about on-screen gruesomeness.  But it is effective at building the tension, and make no mistake, the kids in this film are in real danger.
  I will admit, the film is a slow starter.  After about 15 minutes, I was ready to be disappointed with the rest of the movie.  But once odd things started happening at the grandparents, I was hooked.  The film benefits from an excellent cast.  And unlike many horror films, the people in this film seem like real people, not like the cardboard cutout characters that are just thrown in the mix to watch them die.
The Visit is not as good as his masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense"" but it is one of his better films.  After messes like ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening""  it is good to see him back in form.  Even people who are not fond of found footage films may like this.",1451952000,4,2533,4.298097251585624

7428452,2,B0152AVXUI,"This movie was one of those where I am sitting here trying to figure out....and I am asking myself ""What in the hell did I just watch?"" Geez, has
M. Night Shyamalan's cheese slid off it's cracker or what???? My mind is still spinning. What happened to the kinds of stories that were successful like that of Signs or The Sixth Sense?  There you had the suspense, a great teaser as you were trying to figure out in these earlier movies where the story was going. The movie allowed you to draw conclusions before telling you anything. Those movies had wonderful acting and writing that drew you in. In the Visit....you haven't any sense of a story...the acting is horrible. The basic premise.....Two kids are going to visit their grandparents whom they have never seen. Their mom hasn't spoken to her parents in some 15 years after running off with a substitute teacher she met. The first couple of days....the kids experience some odd behavior which is shrugged off as ""Old folk behavior."" (People don't keep the diapers they take a crap in.) I have cleaned my grandma's oven....she has never asked me to crawl all the way in. Never have I caught her scratching like an animal ....totally wigged out and...naked to boot!...Which is what these kids (Approx 14 and 10 years old.) experience the first three days. Did I mention the spooky references to a mental ward they volunteer counsel at?  Those behaviors alone would have caused me to... grab my little brother (If I had one....) and hightail it out of there....rural or not....my thumb works just fine to get a ride. Shoot, even if I was the 10 year old...I don't think I would stay. Yet the weird keeps going on. You know in your mind,.....your trying to figure out..... where is M. Night Shyamalan going with this??? So your thinking he is going to do something really clever with the story, based on past experience. (Are the grandparents keeping some kind of alien monster? Are they infected with alien DNA or something?) However, the acting is just hokey and the story doesn't allow you to figure anything out or come to a conclusion (SPOILER ALERT!)......Once mom sees the grandparents...through a Skype session with the kids....its all done for you....the moment mom says....""Kids...... those are not your grandparents!"" Within 2 minutes you realize there is no mystery....Just ordinary ""bat pooh crazy killers."" The only difference is that these killers are elderly. M. Night Shyamalan's biggest point of the movie is when the old man takes off his diaper and smears it in the face of the 10 year old boy. That's not clever....its just gross!! Then to add to the disgusting scene is another scene where the boy does comedy rap about the diaper incident. Poor taste ....no pun intended! Save your money...you will have more mystery and suspense with a 48 hour cold. Will it turn into bronchitis? Will it linger for a week or go away in a couple of days? Will I spew something green from my mouth and nose or will it just be a constant clear nasal goo?  Trust me, much more suspense, story line, possibly some decent acting (If you call in sick and lay it on thick) than you will ever get from this movie!",1451952000,5,3163,4.6852517985611515

7428483,5,B0152AVXUI,"Let's be clear,....no one,...and I do mean, NO ONE is as surprised as I am that I actually enjoyed this movie as much as I did.  I fully expected to hate it by the time it was over as that's pretty much how EVERY M. Night movie is for me.  M. Night Shyamalan has an insanely good imagination and all the right ""ideas"" but his ability to fully develop them into a complete story that is properly pieced together is where he really fails (in my opinion).  To be honest, with the exception of ""The Happening"", I have absolutely hated all of his movies.  Again, the ideas were there, but the movies always failed to live up to those ideas.  Take&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B0060D0N9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;for example. [spoilers if you haven't seen it by now]  The idea was good (and apparently I'm the only one that didn't like that movie) but the fact that we, as an audience are supposed to believe that Bruce Willis went for over 6 months without ever having any sort of actual contact with another human is ridiculous.  I mean, if he was dead the whole time, how has his life continued like nothing ever happened?  Nah,....terrible.  But I'm rambling....

Now that I got that out of the way I can give praise to this movie.  Not only was it suspenseful, but he was able to do with with little to no ""violence"", profanity, or nudity (I'm blind too!!!!!).  Yes, those were all in the movie, but they had their purpose.  When the movie first started and I was hearing Ed Oxenbould attempt to ""rap"" I was sure I was about to be disappointed, but as the story progressed he became my favorite character.

Kathryn Hahn plays the mom to Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould).  Long ago, she had a falling out with her parents and hasn't spoken to them since.  After her husband leaves her with the two kids, she is forced to raise them alone while attempting to restart her life.  Eventually her parents establish contact and ask to meet their grand children for the first time.  Even though she doesn't want them to, Becca and Tyler press on until she agrees to let the visit.  At first, Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie) seem like normal, everyday grandparents.  However, the kids quickly realize something isn't quite right.

I gotta say, I thought the acting was amazing!  I was really surprised I liked the kids as much as I did and was equally surprised that I found the grandparents to be complete weirdos.  It's easy to imagine, but hard to pull off as well as everyone did.  Especially seeing as how there were really only 4 cast members.  Sure, you got the mom and a couple others, but they are hardly around more than a few minutes at a time.

2) The hand-held cameras somehow manage to capture more of the action than would seem reasonably possible.

3) Those two kids stayed in the situation A LOT longer than I would have.

The first is its novelty. It looks at horror from a totally different perspective. Ive seen horror films which show zombies, things happen to children, horror based on found footage, etc. but this is different. How about horror involving grandparents?

The second is the engaging acting of the kids. It keeps me interested from the beginning till the end.

The third is the entertaining humor in some scenes. This is also the downside of this picture. It mixes horror with humor. That confuses me a lot. It reduces the scariness.

To me, it has some scary and suspenseful moments but its not a horror movie. Its more like a scary one.

7428527,4,B0152AVXUI,"Shyamalan was LONG overdue for a comeback film. After the solid Signs, its astounding he was still allowed to even make movies. Not only had every one of his films since been quite bad, they were offensively stupid and pandering. The law of averages indicates hed eventually make a not-horrible film, and this certainly qualifies.

The lower-budget certainly helps rein him in here, though there are still a number of issues in the film. The pair of young children can be odd and unsympathetic characters, often sounding too adult or cerebral. The smaller boy is especially grating with his hackneyed rapping, which makes him neither cool nor adorable. The logic of the circumstances doesnt quite work either, as there are still some strange holes and forced decisions to explain things by films end.

But the horror is good. Some have called this film a comedy, and they aren't so far off in that there are some shockingly strange sights and moments in this film. But there are several great parts in this movie that successfully frighten. Some of these are clever jumps, others are goosebump-inducing weirdness. And this film features arguably the best jump scare of the decade. The directors eye for camerawork, editing, sound, and timing are all top-notch in creating some strong and memorable scares in a definite cut above the other usual horror fare.

7428531,4,B0152AVXUI,"Director: M. Night Shyamalan

Screenwriter: M. Night Shyamalan

Cast: Olivia DeJonge, Ed Oxenbould, Deanna Dunagan, Peter McRobbie, and Kathryn Hahn

After 2002s Signs, a director named M. Night Shyamalan went into a tailspin the likes of which have not been seen since, well, the star of Signs, Mel Gibson.  Of course, Shyamalans tailspin was creative in nature, while Gibsons waswell the opposite.  Six films have borne the Shyamalan name since 2002, each literally worse than the previous.  Fast forward to 2015.  Fox airs a little event series on Thursday nights called Wayward Pines adapted, produced, and occasionally directed by Shyamalan that aired over the summer and ended up being a modest hit.  Now with The Visit, Shyamalan strikes while the irons hot, delivering his best film in 13 years and combined with Wayward Pines, successfully reminding us of what a talent he really is.

The Visit represents both a return to form as well as a departure for the eccentric director.  First, after multiple flops in the science fiction genre, Shyamalan returns to what put him on the map  scares.  However, no doubt inspired by his producing partners Blumhouse Productions  the company that produced Paranormal Activity this is Shyamalans first found footage style film.  Like mockumentary television comedies, I think the sun is quickly setting on the found footage horror film, but Shyamalan manages to pull it off here with a personally financed lightning fast production that took 25 crew members 30 days to shoot.

The Visit follows Becca (Olivia DeJonge) as she determines to film a documentary about her and her brother Tylers (Ed Oxenbould) first encounter with their estranged grandparents whom theyve never met.  Now adolescents, Becca and Tyler have finally decided to start a dialogue with their mother, Paula (Kathryn Hahn) that revealed a mysterious falling out had occurred between Paula and her parents.  Consequently, Becca forces her mother to arrange a visit so that she and Tyler can finally meet their grandparents, with a covert agenda that Paula can take a much deserved cruise with her serious boyfriend, Robert (Benjamin Kanes).

Becca and Tyler get their wish and with video camera in hand, they arrive by train somewhere in rural Pennsylvania, greeted by grandparents John (Peter McRobbie), and Dorris (Deanna Dunagan).  Becca and Tyler are driven to their grandparents isolated farmhouse where they expect to spend a week getting to know each other and making family memories.  On the surface, all seems to be on the up and up, except for two rules John and Dorris have for the kids: 1.  Dont go in the basement and 2.  Dont leave your room after 9:30 PM.  These two rules act as the catalyst for the films simple yet unrelenting tension.  Whats outside the bedroom door?  Whats that sound?  Whats in the basement?  Youll have to see the film to find out.

The Visit capitalizes on simple, primal fear.  It is a potboiler that while effective, still does not quite measure up when compared to Shyamalans early work.  However, the film is a major step in the right direction for the auteur who like his Sixth Sense protagonist, was in danger of permanently fading from the public eye (and don't give me that spoiler alert garbage, it was 1999!).  As a critic, The Visit does little to affect my annual lament about the lack of inspired, diverse, original content in the horror genre.  Still, it does offer some good scares and a reasonably effective twist.  Also Oxenbould is fantastic as the younger brother, Tyler.  The infusion of humor that Tylers character brings to the film is perhaps its greatest achievement.  While most horror films tend to feel like clones of others, The Visit does attempt to cross genres not unlike the Evil Dead sequels or Gremlins.  Shyamalan still has something left to prove, but now at least were much more interested in watching him try.  B

7428533,2,B0152AVXUI,"To me, when one sits down to plan (dream up, write, organize, finance, and pre-photograph locations, etc.) a film, one is really keeping an eye towards the cultural barriers of financing and advertising. Books may well end up being subjective in the favor of their authors, but films are mostly all tied up in their advertisements aimed at appeasing more than a few masses of people--what I am saying is that a movie is only as good as its advertising potential indicates. In the case of this new M. Night Shyamalan travesty, we find the once persistent writer and director of pictures like ""Signs"" at a falling off point of his career, unable to provoke either a good ad campaign or a scare in his audience. Reverting to the rather tiresome angle of using handheld ""home movie"" cameras to tell his story, Shyamalan seems to be working out some of his love for making movies through the Rebecca character (herself a wannabe documentarian) and some of his contempt for modern day youth through her brother, the Tyler character. The problem is, at least for this reviewer, that the movie is never once funny, scary, or interesting (obviously, some of the juveniles who were seated before me at the theater don't share my opinion--""that was a great movie!"" one of them exclaimed after it was over), and all that Shyamalan is left with is his same old bag of tricks that worked wonders before a gullible public back in the days of ""The Sixth Sense"" but today merely seems childish (much like the film itself), stale, and unimaginative. Why he has the Tyler character as an obsessive rapper is beyond me, but these reaches for moments of quality humor fall so flat, one after the other. And unless you are an easily (and I do mean EASILY) frightened or jumpy person, then you won't find ""The Visit"" very much to endure for a horror film at all--scenes of the crazy grandmother growling at close-up in front of the camera, carrying a Bates-model butcher knife around the house after dark, and urinating and even puking (oh my God, I had a nauseating sense that ""IT FOLLOWS"" had some type of insidious influence upon this new sickening trend of physical sickness in thriller films) never once managed to get me, despite the fact that I tried to remain invested in the story. Nonetheless, it did not take long for me to start nodding off and I paid to watch the damned thing! Any attempts at suspense were rendered incompetent due to the fact that the film keeps pulling us out of the tension with a fragile emotional tale of a strange, messy divorce and its impact upon the poor kids who are always the victims of something bigger than themselves in these cases. And, the grievous twist at the end of the movie was totally unexpected--but once I found out what it was, I was concerned at the level of imaginative poverty that it contained. I don't always agree with the scattershot Mark Kermode, but I'm afraid his points about this picture are spot on. Unfunny humor, annoying children, strange and rather lazy camera work, and simplistic attempts to shock render this tale pointless...despite the fact that it is aimed at a more juvenile audience and isn't intended to be an Oscar contender in any way.
Now don't get me wrong, I hate to complain about this movie (although ""The Happening"" is one of the worst movies I have ever encountered on a narrative level) because I think there should be fun, somewhat mindless offerings at the movie houses for kids to go and enjoy and not have to be emotionally or mentally taxed by (there is NOTHING wrong with just having fun). But, it felt to me as if Shyamalan really didn't have much of a script here, and the laziness of the writing is simply on display in copious spades throughout. Shyamalan probably can't become the next R. L. Stine, however, so I have no idea why he is trying to make fraudulent children's films these days, I just don't understand it.
After having endured (and in some ways enjoyed) the savage, uncomfortable stomach-churner from Eli Roth entitled ""The Green Inferno,"" I thought it would be cool to watch a far less intense movie from an old hand like Night, just to wind down. But the problem is that ""The Green Inferno"" remains the most unique and the most unforgettable experience I have yet had at the theater this season--while it is shocking and horrifying undoubtedly, its powerful images and grinding suspense have been with me for days; its beautiful cinematography, lighting, and perilous situations outdoing even the often hazardous snowbound film ""Everest"" even. Shyamalan's manic decent into juvenile delirium will leave me scratching my head for a time, but its imagery and point I have almost already forgotten. I hope that we don't need more hyper-intense movies from the Eli Roth factory to give us a reason to visit the theater and watch great cinematography and unreal locations on the big screen. As for this housebound horror, I am giving it two diapers in the face out of a possible five. D+",1443830400,,4978,4.709862385321101

7428535,1,B0152AVXUI,"Warning...spoilers!!!!

Just when I thought M Night Shyamalan couldn't sink any further creatively he attempts to jump on the camcorder horror bandwagon about 10 years too late with The Visit, a painfully dull thriller about two siblings who visit the grandparents they have never seen (her mother was estranged from them when she was a high school senior who ran off with one of her teachers to have a baby) while mom goes on a cruise with her new boyfriend (dad ran off with a Starbucks barista after 10 years of marriage and has no contact with his former family).  The older sister sibling is a wannabe filmmaker who is filming everything about the trip for a possible documentary which shockingly still makes her less annoying than her little brother who fancies himself a rapper.

In any case the grandparents act strange--which at first can be written off as them being old and suffering from some legitimate medical issues that come with advanced age.  But they get stranger and possibly even dangerous as the week progresses until the siblings become afraid for their lives and ask their mom to pick them up as soon as her cruise ends.

There's nothing wrong with the set-up but there's also virtually no suspense in the film's first two-thirds.  I suppose if this were by a first-time director and you were comparing it to any of the Paranormal Activity films (which is a very low bar) The Visit might not seem so bad, although it still would have needed to come out years ago before the camcorder horror thing had completely lost its novelty.  But when you consider that Shyamalan in his early career was considered by many to be the next Steven Spielberg it's hard to view The Visit as anything other than a further disaster on the downward spiral of his sad career.  Even if After Earth and The Last Airbender were bad at least they had some ambition--The Visit is the kind of movie a filmmaker with no money or resources makes to break into the business.

Then there's the third act twist.  Read no further if you still plan on seeing the movie.  The grandparents turn out not to be the siblings' real grandparents at all but two escaped lunatics from a local asylum--the real grandparents are dead in the basement.  The first problem with this is that it makes no sense if you give it even a moment's thought--two dangerous mental patients escape from a hospital where a couple volunteered as counselors, then the old couple never shows up at the hospital again, missing scheduled volunteer dates.  Do you seriously think there is any chance the police and hospital staff wouldn't notice the connection?  The real grandparents counseled these two.  Then there's the fact that the twist is significantly diminishing even if you buy it--The Visit goes from being a supernatural horror film with any number of possible explanations for the behavior of its characters to a very mundane and down to earth one.  To put it another way, the mystery of the first two-thirds of the movie becomes a lot less interesting once the viewer realizes what's actually going on.

The last section of the film after the big reveal is more lively than what came earlier but never actually rises to the level of being suspenseful.  The best that can be said of The Visit is that the actors playing the grandparents and siblings are all pretty good, especially under the circumstances, but the bottom line is that The Visit is neither scary nor suspenseful and even though it has much more polished production values and acting than camcorder horror films normally do it's still not worth sitting through.  The Visit ends with two unbelievably ill-advised scenes that demonstrate how much M Night Shyamalan's storytelling skills have atrophied.  The first is a teary-eyed, sappy scene that simply has no place being at the end of a thriller or horror film--it's Lifetime melodrama movie of the week stuff.  The second and worse unnecessary scene is a rap by the little brother about his experiences on the farm which definitely should have been a Blu-ray deleted scene rather than something that actually made it into the movie.

Don't make The Visit unless you are looking for a reason to hate M Night Shyamalan even more--at this point I'm close to wishing him a death as slow and painful as his movies.",1443484800,5,4297,4.762803234501348
7428536,4,B0152AVXUI,"M. Night Shyamalan. If you're reading this review then chances are you're a serious film goer familiar with his work, and probably have an opinion about him one way or another. There's no middle ground with him, basically; you either recognize his early auteur-driven work as evidence of his talent, or consider the slog of blockbuster flops and barely-competent thrillers proof he's really a hack. For whatever reason, Shyamalan's failures have become an indelible part of how he's perceived, in a way most other directors don't have to contend with. And perhaps that is why there has been so much attention on The Visit, a found footage horror that has received generally good early buzz. Is it the film to finally quiet his critics?

The Visit is, easily, Shyamalan's best film in years, showing the tense, gut-wrenching emotional twists and technical skill that made his early stuff so special. That he's managed to tap into that in a genre that has encouraged laziness in filmmakers only makes the accomplishment more impressive. Let's not go too far overboard, though; some of Shyamalan's annoying habits are still in play, but this is a genuinely scary film that uses some ingenious framing and bursts of humor to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.

The story is simple, and works best when kept on a narrow focus. Teen siblings Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and Tyler (Ed Oxenbould, last seen in that 'Alexander' movie with the overlong title) are off to spend a week with the grandparents they've never met. Their mother (Kathryn Hahn) ran away from home at a young age after a spat with her parents, so this is an early act of reconciliation, in a way. It also gives her a chance to go away on a beach cruise with a boyfriend suspiciously kept in the background. In any other film we'd be eyeing him as the potential source of any future shenanigans, but the weirdness actually takes place on Nana (Deanna Dunagan) and Pop-Pop's (Peter McRobbie) isolated Pennsylvania farm.

Shyamalan, always a terrific writer and director of kid actors, quickly gives us reason to be invested in Becca and Tyler's well-being. The two couldn't be more different; she's an over-serious aspiring filmmaker with hopes of documenting the experience; he's a rambunctious wannabe rapper with a foul mouth (but a clever way to conceal it). Most of all they really want to make this work in hopes of helping their mom get beyond her troubled past. Everything seems great at first, like Norman Rockwell levels of all-American perfection. Nana's always baking; Pop-Pop is a sturdy, powerful man who chops wood...what could go wrong?

Well, everything. It isn't long before strange things start happening. There's something rotten going on in Pop-Pop's shed; and Nana starts going a little nuts after 9:30pm. Soon it doesn't matter what time of the day it is. A game of hide-and-seek goes incredibly wrong, and strangers on the street might want to watch out for Pop-Pop when he gets agitated. Shyamalan teases a number of possible culprits, from the supernatural to the more mundane, but ultimately this is a film that touches on a couple of issues familiar in his work. One is the eventual betrayal of our bodies, especially as we grow older. The other is the value of a real, open connection between parents and their children. Shyamalan goes a little overboard in conveying these points, just as he goes way overboard with some of Tyler's humor (especially during the nauseating end credits), but at least this feels like a film he genuinely believes in, which is why he shelled out $5M of his own cash to make it.  It's not a hack work-for-hire job like After Earth or an oversized blockbuster adaptation like The Last Airbender.

7428537,4,B0152AVXUI,"Well it's nice to see a little evolution in M. Night's director skills..no more retarded uber out of left field darn near ruined your own movie twists.
This one is nothing special either as far as the ""twist"" goes but that's good because the ""twist"" shouldn't ALWAYS make the movie, sometimes it's successful like Sixth Sense but not necessary component to a good movie.
In The Visit the ""twist"" is far from unbelievable as it's been done in movies before and a lot, but through the believable acting and some creepy moments a good entertaining movie is born.
Not mind blowing but entertaining and that's a good thing for M. Night, one the last crapfests of his featuring Will Smith and son had no twist and still sucked but that's because we knew what was going to happen AS IT HAPPENED, which is BORING.
The only point of contention I have is the flimsy BS reason why the Mom has not talked to her PARENTS since she was a teenager and had a falling out with them...it would take Oh so much for a mother to be OK with a) not seeing her PARENTS ever again and b) the very real possibility that her children never meet their own grandparents. That part was very force and fortunately not the focus of this movie, just a clumsy tool.

7428538,1,B0152AVXUI,"This movie really shocked me and not in a good way.

The start was promising. There was a really spooky scene somewhere in the middle when the kids / teenagers play hide-and-seek under the house. I was expecting a super-natural explanation for all that weirdness that went on.

*** Spoiler ***

But no. The movie thrives from fear of the mentally ill people that - in my opinion - belongs to the 19th century. This fear is combined with the fear of old people (wrinkles, sagging skin, etc.) and presented as a horror show.

In the movie there is ""grandma"" who murdered her own kids a long time ago and now feels lonely. She wants to be visited by grandchildren. There is grandpa, who stocks his soiled diapers in the barn (heaps of them, one wonders how many weeks he has been storing them there). Or he sits there with the barrel of his rifle in his mouth, considering.
Other than that they are great hosts, picking the kids up at the train station, driving them all the way to the farm house, cooking, talking, and being grandparents.
The kids are left alone with these people for a week. Their mother has not spoken to them (her own parents) in 15 years. They had a fight when the mother was 19 and wanted to marry the man she loved. Her parents opposed her, so she left them, never to return, never to discuss the decision. Apart from that she has had a good relationship with her parents, she claims.

Now the mother wants to go on a vacation with her new partner and the kids need to go somewhere, right?

The most appalling scene this movie comes up with is by the end when the ""grandpa"" smears one of his used diapers into the boy's face.
At the end of the film the boy makes a funny rap-song about it ""s*** does not taste like chicken"".

This movie made me feel sick.",1443398400,3,1776,4.331325301204819
7428539,4,B0152AVXUI,"OK. I must really admit: the movie looked alright in the preview but as soon as I saw Shyamalan was the director, I was kind of turned off (so to speak) I am ever so glad that I decided to watch this despite my distaste for the director.
This movie has comedy, horror, ""boo"" moments that actually terrify and yes even a Hansel and gretel type feel to it. It all works just dandy.

The movie is filmed in a documentary fashion, where two children tote around a couple of cameras filming their visit with their grandparents.  The camera angles are always perfect, and the focus is always in sync.  The flawless filming is a constant reminder that this is a bad, unconvincing fake.  The Visit is an example of a terribly unbelievable, overplayed and burned out genre.  This would have been a much better movie if it wasn't made in a fake documentary fashion.

The two kids are a sister and brother.  The younger brother is an aspiring rapper, for some reason.  The rapping part was annoying, and ridiculous, and an unnecessary character trait.  The rapping really sounds stupid.

7428542,2,B0152AVXUI,"Warning Spoilers!

The concept is simple. A teenage girl with a love of filmmaking and her
white-rapper younger brother go to spend a week with their beloved
grandparents.

Within the span of about ten-minutes the kids and the
viewer start to grasp on to the idea that grandma and grandpa aren't
playing with a full deck, and whenever one grandparent is discovered to
be doing something really 'weird,' the other explains it as a condition
of the mind; always adding something to the effect of ""oh, you're
disappointed in us"" or ""you're not having a very good time.""

Those are sentiments that could easily describe my reaction to this movie, as once again I am disappointed in M. Night taking a fairly cool concept and wrecking
it with an idiotic script, and no, I did not have a good time watching
this at all.

First question is why did Mr. Shayamalan make this a camcorder movie in
the first place? He's just setting himself up for a movie awash in
unbelievability, and I know I am not the only one who is sick to death
of camcorder movies anyway. Putting that aside, he casts truly mediocre
actors for the pivotal role of the grandparents and just OK actors for
the kids.

Third, why is the 13-year old boy portrayed as an obnoxious,
mouthy white kid who thinks he can rap? I disliked that kid from the
very first time he opened his mouth to rap, which basically had me
caring less what happens to him in the film ... and a lot does happen
to him and his sister, as the film goes for the gusto in the final
segment.

The problem is, the 'gusto' is a twist in the story that
anyone could see coming, and even if I had not seen it coming, I could
have cared less. The movie was over for me long before the trade-mark
Shyamalan story shift.

OK, so there's the concept and some concerns. But beyond all that, this
is without question Shyamalan's worst film ever, and I am even placing
it above ""The Happening"" in pure stupidity. It is not scary and the
humor which is primarily the kids, especially the boy, saying profane
things when they're scared, is just not effective. But the humor is not
the only element that is not effective, neither are most of the horror
elements in the story, which Shyamalan liberally steals from almost
every Asian horror film ever created.

Bottom line: M. Night Shyamalan takes another wonderful premise and
destroys every chance of that premise becoming something special in the
annals of horror films.",1443225600,3,2438,4.537585421412301

7428544,4,B0152AVXUI,"I badly wanted The Visit to be a good movie.

 After a couple of instant classics (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) and some decent suspense outings (Signs and The Village), Shyamalan began one of the most bizarre downward spirals in directing history, dedicating the last decade of his career to churning out cinematic train wrecks like Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender (LitW was so spectacularly bad that it made my recent list of the ten worst films ever made, a decision that I stand by).  When word came out that The Visit would be a return to form, I hoped against hope that this one would save him.  Even so, I went in with my doubts; Shyamalans been known for misleading advertising in the pastwould this be a similar case?

 As it turns out, no.

 Its with equal parts relief and pleasure that I can announce The Visit delivers on all fronts, providing suspense with quirky comic relief at all the right moments.
 This film-within-a-film opens with a wholly believable explanation as to why we are watching found footage: our teenage protagonist Rebecca is an aspiring filmmaker setting out to make a documentary about her broken family.  Beccas mother Paula (Kathryn Hahn) became involved with an older man at 19, and Paulas parents did not approve of the relationship.  Paula eventually left home under unpleasant circumstances, and she hasn't spoken to her parents in fifteen years...but she won't reveal to Becca why.  Deciding that finally meeting her grandparents is the only way to discover the truth, Becca sets out to right past wrongs via her documentary.  She and her younger brother Tyler travel to the old folks isolated home, and it doesnt take long for things to get disconcerting...
 From the first moment the grandparents (Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie) are on screen, we immediately know something is off about them.  This couple is weirdly detached and roboticat first it seems like the quirks of old age, but as the film rolls on its increasingly apparent that something far more sinister is taking place.  Pop-pop is convinced that people following him and that a white thing with yellow eyes is waiting for us.  Nana laughs hysterically at nothing and crawls around on all fours at night.  To say anything more about them would only spoil the surprises, and in classic Shyamalan fashion The Visit delivers a satisfying final-act twist.
 Entertaining as the creepy elderly antics are to watch, The Visit is carried just as much by the performances of Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as siblings Becca and Tyler.  These two engage right off the bat and are characterized to a degree that is rare for a Paranormal-Activity-style thriller.  DeJonge is convincing as a sophisticated, slightly pretentious young filmmaker concerned with the ethics of film (she avoids exploitation and staged shots), and Oxenbould steals many a scene as aspiring rapper T-Diamond Stylus (an element that somehow avoids being annoying).
 Shyamalan even provides some great emotional resonance, and as we learn more and more about the familys past, we only want the young protagonists to survive the ordeal even more.

 One thoroughly impressive aspect about The Visit is how the tone switches so effortlessly between tension and comedy.  When I saw this in theaters, the audience was engaged by every scene; one moment the crowd was laughing at an improvised rap about pineapple upside-down cake, and the next we were staring down a dark hallway and waiting with baited breath for a crazed grandma to come lunging at the camera.  During the oven scene, the theater got quieter than Ive heard in a long time.
 In a genre oversaturated with found-footage films, The Visit will likely go down as one of the few that uses the medium to its advantage.  There is no end to the creative angles, and at times its easy to forget that this is a found-footage film at all.

 In short, the apocalypse may well be upon usM. Night Shyamalan made another great movie!  I certainly hope this is a sign of things to come from him, because its been too long since Ive enjoyed a Shyamalan movie for the reasons that he intended.  Hell, it may even be worth seeing twice, if only to see your friends reactions.",1443225600,,4209,4.8433566433566435
7428545,2,B0152AVXUI,"Another dud from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan. Two young children visit their very strange grandparents with dark secrets, who allow them to film their every move anyway for the children's documentary. The Visit is yet another unsatisfying, boring 'found footage' film, filled with lame, silly, forced laughs. It basically follows the same tired formula as ""Paranormal Activity""

There are a few creepy moments but you'll have to wait until the last 15 minutes for the film to turn and get going, which is way too late to save it. The acting is fine, but the scares are scarce.

Tyler's (Ed Oxenbould) rap scenes are cute the first few seconds, but quickly become equivalent to nails on a chalk board.",1443052800,3,707,4.932773109243698
7428546,4,B0152AVXUI,"This is a slow-burning film, not really a thriller, but certainly tense and suspenseful. The plot is simple and relies on gradually increasing doubt, confusion and suspicion. It is based on a classic horror fiction trope of isolation. Outdoor shots at the grandparents' farm emphasise this, they are both beautiful and threatening.

The film does not rely on horror cliches or cheap scares, but is grounded in the far more disturbing and emotionally engaging vulnerability of two children who inadvertently find themselves in a situation where questions perpetually arise and weave insidiously into the children's minds. The grandparents are old, and old people sometimes behave eccentrically. But the 'rational' explanations for the children's increasing unease, and ours, never quite jell.

The other feature which works well is that both children use video cameras to document their visit. Becca comments regularly on the constructedness of documentary. The scene where her own vulnerabilities are revealed is moving, and embodies one of the key themes, and a central concern in Shyamalan's work, the problematical qualities of perception. The twist in the tale is clever and convincing. However, the film's climax is a little glib and falls back on some standard horror tactics.

The Visit should appeal particularly to young adults and teenagers. It is at times humorous and witty and will suit those looking for a strong, disturbing experience.",1443052800,,1450,5.407079646017699
7428547,4,B0152AVXUI,"In THE VISIT, Becca (Olivia DeJonge) and her younger brother, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould) set out on a week-long trip to spend and visit with their mothers parents. Their mom (Kathryn Hahn) left home as a teenager after horrible fight and has never spoken to them since then. Through the miracle of the Internet, her parents have located their long-estranged daughter and have begged to spend a week with their grandchildren while they still can. Becca and Tylers father abandoned his wife and children and moved out to California with a younger woman and Beccas mom has really been stressing out lately. She and Tyler convince their Mom it will be a great idea. Also, while the kids are gone, they are sending Mom on a cruise with her boyfriend for some needed rest and relaxation (none of them have been away from each other since dad left). In the meantime, Becca is a budding filmmaker and decides to make a documentary of the whole experience, in the hopes that it can bring some much needed catharsis and closure to her mother.

So, the kids board a train and set out to meet Pop Pop (Grandpa played by Peter McRobbie) and Nana (Grandma played by Deanna Dunagan). The couple live away from town in the country, foreshadowing the sense of eeriness and foreboding that will occur. At first things are fine. Nana loves to bake, Pop Pop is funny, and both grandparents are so pleased to see their grandchildren. However, that night after bed time, things start to get spooky. When morning comes, its as though nothing happens. But the kids know something just isn't quite right and the strange things that happened on the first night of their visit quickly escalate.

I really enjoyed THE VISIT. I found it an entertaining romp of good fun. There were parts that I found really, really funny. There were other parts that scared me. There was even one scene in the movie that completely grossed me out. I enjoyed the variety in tone of the movie, but I know some people wont. The movie has some great acting. Theres a major twist in the movie, but neither me or none of the people I was with figured it out. Also, Kathryn Hahn plays the mom and I really like her as an actress.

The film is being marketed as a found footage movie, but its really not that. Instead, its actually a faux documentary (not a mockumentary). Found footage movies are just that: they are supposed to be pieces of film footage that were found after some horrifying event. Mockumentaries are faux documentaries that mock the documentary format (thing anything by Christopher Guest). THE VISIT isn't either one of those. Its a fictional movie, but one that if filmed and edited together as a real documentary. Although the subject matter is different, THE VISIT most reminded me of a small little movie I saw several years ago entitled AMERICAN ZOMBIE. I liked that movie and I liked THE VISIT.

With that said, one really cant talk about THE VISIT without talking about the director, M. Night Shyamalan. Fifteen years ago, Shyamalan was one of the biggest director/writer/producers in Hollywood. Things started going downhill in his career with THE VILLAGE and until now have just gotten worse. I actually liked THE VILLAGE, but didn't think it was as strong as other Shyamalan movies. I also love LADY IN THE WATER. However, I hated THE HAPPENING and have yet to see THE LAST AIRBENDER or AFTER EARTH, although Ive heard they are both awful. Although the past few years have been rough for Shyamalan, THE VISIT is a movie that shows he still has it. I believe years from now it will be the film that is pointed to as the turn around for his career. Hopefully, he will be able to build upon the success of this feature and continue making the great movies he used to make.",1442880000,77,3741,4.629518072289157
7428548,4,B0152AVXUI,"About time we got something decent from M Night again!  In the found-footage tradition, although it is actually more of ""real-time amateur"", we get a very creepy film that preys on our fears of aging, and trust, but with a few twists and some dark humor as well.  You'll recognize some of the elements from Little Red Riding Hood and other tales that most of us have grown up with in some form or the other.

Couple that with some fantastic acting, and the idea that what you see isn't necessarily what you get.  The scenes are back and forth, from the innocent and hurting children, played exceptionally well by Ed Oxenbould and Olivia DeJonge, to the kind and grandparently Deanna Dunagan and Peter McRobbie, who end up terrifyingly creepy.

The basic premise is that the kids have never met their grandparents, their father is off having divorced the mom after running off with a younger woman, and they are heading out into the country to stay with the grandparents so their mom can finally have some fun.  Becca, the older sister, is a film buff, and is filming for a school project.  There is emotion here, and anyone who has been through tough family situations will recognize them, and see that in how the kids behave, how they relate to grandparents they have never met, ultimately how their relationships transform.  Humor anchors the film, but the kind of humor where you laugh because you are uncomfortable.

7428550,4,B0152AVXUI,"I'm going to stay away from the usual gibberish about M. Night Shyamalan's fall from grace as a film director.  Suffice it to say, this film is a good one.  It isn't quite a ""very"" good one because it uses the tired ""found footage"" angle.  If nothing else, at least the story had a reasonable explanation and in fact, the footage was never lost.

Kathryn Hahn (""Tomorrowland""), still expanding her acting roots, plays the divorced mother of 2, on her way to a vacation cruise with her new boyfriend.  While she's gone, she's shuttling off her 15 year old daughter, Becca (Olivia DeJonge, another cutie from Australia) and 13 year old son, Tyler (Ed Oxenbould, ""Paper Planes"") to her parent's house, a train ride away.  Becca is a budding documentarian so she decides the trip would be a good subject for a story.  How her mom grew up.  Thus, the ""found footage"" conceit.

A thread that runs throughout the movie is that Mom hasn't seen or talked with her parents in 15 years, having walked out as a 19 year old with the kids' dad.  Something happened that caused the rift and Mom isn't sharing.  Mom tells Becca to ask her grandparents.  So the kids arrive with Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie, ""Inherent Vice"") and Nana (Deanna Dunagan, ""Just Like a Woman"") there to greet them.  Off they go to their country house, complete with off-limit basements, creepy sheds and forlorn wooded areas.

Everything seems pretty normal for a while.  But then Pop Pop poops his pants a lot and stores the adult diapers in the shed.  And Nana sleepwalks every night after 9:30.  Each has a reasonable explanation for the strange behavior of the other.  Becca understands.  They're old she tells Tyler.  But there is more to the strange behavior which of course, I'm remiss to divulge.  Suffice it to say, all isn't what it seems.  Shyamalan has delivered a creepy, disturbing ""horror"" film and has done it with reason and conviction and a touch of humor.  The actors are very good.
