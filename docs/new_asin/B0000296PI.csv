1250940,5,B0000296PI,"I am currently attending massage school and I have been introduced to a variety of techniques!  (More than I care to mention!)  Take it from me, the most wonderful thing about this video is that Robert does not focus solely on one modality.  Instead, he incorporates a variety of techniques.  I have purchased other videos on massage - as learning tools - and have found the majority of them to be mundane and perfunctory.  I love the fact that Robert is not afraid to ""work the body"".  Meaning that he is not so concerned with practicalities of draping, etc.  It is amazing how people can loose their modesty if they feel that they are in the hands of a professional with professional intent; and once they realize the wonderful feeling (not to mention value) of incorporating several body parts at once, that their massage experience is all the more satisfying.  I highly recommend this tape to beginners and to those who have been practicing for some time.  Sometimes, we think that we have the recipe for a perfect massage, but seeing someone else's techinque can really make a profound difference in our application.  Don't skip over this one!",1024617600,30,1148,4.752525252525253
1250941,5,B0000296PI,"My husband and I bought this tape to take our massage exchanges to a higher level. We were pleased with the professional quality and instruction presented in the tape. We love the way this tape breaks down each area of the body, showing areas for work and areas to avoid. After years of receiving professional massages, it was interesting to see some new approaches. The instructor is obviously an experienced professional!
Our whole family watched this tape first on a Sunday afternoon, cuddling up on the couch (including our 3-1/2 yr old). The music was very nice and it was very relaxing. We found ourselves wishing that Robert Haase worked in our area of the country so we could have him as our massage therapist!
All in all, we feel we learned a lot from the tape. We will be watching it over and over to learn more. We recommend it highly to anyone wishing to learn more about massage. If we could ask for any additional instruction, it would be for more extensive instruction on how to use hands and fingers in different strokes. Alas, no one tape can do everything.",983664000,28,1074,4.598958333333333
1250942,5,B0000296PI,"Finally, a professional massage video that is informative and easy to understand.  I knew nothing about massage, now I feel like a professional. Thanks you. I have recommended the video to all my friends. P.S. My wife  thanks you also!",963878400,17,235,4.85
1250943,5,B0000296PI,"I am so impressed with your video, Massage with Confidence.  To finally find a video that teaches so many wonderful techniques is refreshing.  Although I've been a massage therapist for several years, this video showed  me great techniques that I was never taught in school.  Thank you for such  a well-done production with so many useful tools.  I am recommending this  video to all of my clients as well as other massage therapists.  Great job,  Mr. Haase!",955756800,56,458,4.8441558441558445
1250944,5,B0000296PI,"Over the years I've collected numerous massage videos.  I've been disappointed that most are either sensual in nature, or don't show enough advanced techniques.  With Massage with Confidence, I found a gold  mine.
The massage sequence shown was amazing.  It was a wonderful  combination of gentle, soothing strokes and deeper techniques.  Robert (the  guy on the video) even used his elbows for deep pressure.  I was impressed  also by the clear instruction that he gave with each technique.
This  video gave me some basic anatomy and physiology to understand what I was  going to massage, but even more important, it showed me the  ""caution"" areas so I don't hurt anyone.
If you buy just one  video, make it this one.",939945600,115,718,4.883333333333334
1250965,1,B0000296PI,I do not recommend this video.  Its poorly filmed and shows only basic techniques.  Looks like it was shot in the 80s on VHS and just recently put on DVD.  I'd keep looking if I were you.,1290643200,3,187,4.0
1250966,5,B0000296PI,"I am a massage student and absolutely love this video. It is made very professionally and shows a full massage. Very informative and I know that I will use this one again and again.

1250967,2,B0000296PI,"If you want a DVD that shows a large man (who's shoulders roll forward from bad posture)giving a tan woman a really nice massage, then this is the DVD for you.
It doesn't really give any instruction.  I should have only paid about $20 for this so I feel pretty ripped off.
If this is a 4-5 star DVD then I am in for huge disappointments with other massage DVDs.",1255219200,6,361,4.1571428571428575
1250968,2,B0000296PI,"This video is for home use only. It does not cover deep work, trigger points, sports massage or myofascial release like it claims. It is a good relaxing swedish routine for home use only.",1252108800,7,187,4.529411764705882

1250971,5,B0000296PI,"I have reviewed several massage videos, including deep tissue, manual lymph drainage, sports massage, the Anatomy Trains series, and more. This video is one of the BEST for the beginners or intermediate therapists who need a little refresher. I particularly like the endangerment zones, it's not shown enough on other videos.  I like Bob's presentation, and really like the DVD format and the ability to stop/pause and return to specific parts at any time. Bravo for making the transition from VHS to DVD!",1208908800,3,505,5.0843373493975905
1250972,5,B0000296PI,"This DVD is one of the best on the market.  The massage techniques are presented in a manner that is easy for the amateur as well as the professional to understand and follow.  The DVD covers all the information necessary for a complete massage session.  Mr. Haase does an outstanding job of explaining the process while he demonstrates the techniques for the viewer.
Exceptional value for the price!",1208822400,2,400,4.852941176470588
1250973,5,B0000296PI,"This video has great information and great delivery. The instructor show's great technique throughout the entire body, and also explains in simple terms contraindications and site of caution.
The pace of the video allowed me to keep focus without wanting to fastforward or skip to the next section. I highy recommend it.",1208736000,2,320,5.173076923076923
1250974,5,B0000296PI,It's a real treat to watch Robert's massage video.  This is THE BEST massage video I've ever watched!  I especially like how informative he is in regards to the massage strokes and the endangerment zones. The massage flow is phenomenal to watch and he is so very graceful while performing the strokes.,1208736000,,301,4.769230769230769
1250985,5,B0000296PI,"I own a large number of massage videos & dvds, but this is the best I've found. It is very comprehensive and gives instructions for the most complete massage I've ever seen, hands down. The camara shots/angles are so excellent that even a novice can learn to confidently give massage from them. The background is pleasant without being distracting and avoids being boring. It is also the most classic I've found, the program was recorded in 1993 and yet because of the background and the apparel worn it remains pretty undated looking.
But be aware that this is not the type of program that you could easily just follow along with to do a massage because he often does just one side of the body. However, this is a teaching video, and the best of it's kind. If you wanted to do a massage following along you would have to replay sections so as to do both sides of the body. But I don't find this to be a negative. The instructions are so clear and concise it is easy after just a few viewings to understand the technique.  The program is just under an hour long and even goes into often neglected areas of face, scalp, chest and abdomen. Most programs avoid the abdomen. This really is a complete full-body massage avoiding only the breasts (on a woman) and the genetals. Everything else is explained and demonstrated. This is the one program that is a must in my library.",1204588800,5,1372,4.488
1250986,3,B0000296PI,"I am a professionally licensed massage therapist with 6 years experience.

I based my buying decision on reviews and the DVD description and jacket photo, which give the impression that advanced massage techniques are demonstrated. This video presents very basic Swedish massage, nothing more. The  contents listed on the DVD cover claim to teach myofascial release, trigger point therapy, sports massage and deep tissue techniques. Sorry to say, NONE of these is included in the massage session in the video. I'm not sure how the therapist, Robert Haase, expects to perform deep tissue therapy or myofascial release when the first thing he does is slather his client with gobs of massage oil. He does not slow down, much less pause, long enough in his massage to even remotely perform trigger point therapy, deep tissue release or MFR. The video demonstrates a good, basic Swedish massage routine but nothing advanced or unique. If you are a therapist with any experience at all there's little here that will be enlightening. The music soundtrack is annoying and a better choice could have been made.

On a positive note: the model in the video is beautiful and draping is presented in a great way.  It was refreshing to see a real massage session performed without a 'first grade' mentality of over-draping. Many therapists fiddle around with draping so much during a session that it destroys vitually all continuity and is very distracting. Most therapists, once they have some experience and have established a trusting, professional relationship with their clients, end up draping as shown anyway. I'm not sure what all the negative comments are addressing-nothing presented in the video violates local laws or will offend the modesty/comfort level of most clients. Every client is different and a therapist should use common sense and drape to make his/her client the most comfortable, the video merely shows one way of doing it.

If you are new to massage this is a good video to have and you'll no doubt pick up some useful tidbits of information. If you are interested in advanced or structural massage (sports, trigger point, MFR) you'll find none of that here. Art Riggs', ""Advanced Deep Tissue Massage and Myofascial Release"", is an excellent choice for serious therapists.",1189987200,77,2285,5.082666666666666
1250987,5,B0000296PI,"If you want to learn some massage or just catch up on your skills then this is an excellent DVD. I would highly recommend it. It's informative, easy to follow and gives you a good basic routine to work from.

 I have seen a few DVD's that have claimed to teach massage but have been full of terrible camera angles, bad lighting, or just bad technique.",1176422400,,351,4.303030303030303
1250988,5,B0000296PI,"The DVD is presented in an easy way to understand with great camera angles, would recommend for anyone.",1171238400,2,103,4.777777777777778
1250989,5,B0000296PI,"I have a number of massage videos and this one is probably the best in terms of watchability,and learning without being too focused on excessive verbal instruction...he does a great job and you can watch it over to keep learning...very relaxing on its own as well",1113264000,2,263,4.739130434782608
1250990,1,B0000296PI,"I bought this video because I was looking for a new technique to add to my routine. I didn't find any, sorry. I wouldn't recommend the draping techniques if your a male therapist like myself and you're working on a female client (unless you don't care for a tip or a return customer). The whole video was fast pace (except the beginning) and pretty much just basics. Picture quality was good and the model was beautiful. I guess I did gain confidence though by watching this video, it made me realize that I know alot more than I thought. Beginners video only.",1052352000,23,560,4.5
1250991,5,B0000296PI,"I was skeptical at first, and thought that this would just be ""another"" standard massage video.  Boy, was I soon proved wrong!!!  This is indeed, a high quality video, including not only the live demonstration, but also the information, contraindications, and muscle knowledge.  I watched this video at least 3 times, to make sure that I was getting the techniques down correctly and quickly added various new techniques to my massage.
Mr. Hasse was clear, concise, and right on the mark with all of his information.  I am a stickler for details and found that the camera angles were excellent and one could quickly pick up on any of the techniques.  I was also impressed with his method of draping that was less cumbersome than what I was used to.
I highly recommend this video to the novice as well as to the experienced therapist.",1050364800,29,833,4.7172413793103445
1250992,5,B0000296PI,"The video starts out with short, but helpful and clear, instructions, preparations and advice for performing massage (setting, technique, anatomy and contraindications).  Then, it flows into a full body massage routine, starting with the back.  The routine is fairly typical Swedish with a hint of deep work and personal style mixed in.  Each body group is preceded with a short anatomy and endangerment area lesson.  Every technique is narrated by Mr. Haase, with soft instrumental background music.  Side laying massage is demonstrated and explained as well.  The video is ends with a list of Conditions, that can be massaged...  Conditions not to be massaged.  Miss Karina Jones is the ""model"" used in the video (many accolades to her).  Thank you Mr. Haase, for a pleasant, very well prepared demonstration video.",1046131200,7,817,5.223076923076923
