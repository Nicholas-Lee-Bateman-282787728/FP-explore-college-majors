6788644,4,B00P6WX57M,"For those of us who grew up in the 70s and 80s the name Richard Pryor immediately made you laugh. Pryor was a comedic genius who made us laugh on record, in concert, on TV and in movies. While he received great rewards for his abilities and accolades from his peers, he led a troubled life in private. What this movie does is to attempt to tell you the story of the man behind the laughter.

Using still photographs and narration, the movie talks about the past of Pryor, from his early childhood to growing up living in a whorehouse operated by his grandmother where his mother worked. It sounds like a rough childhood and it was, leaving an impression on Pryor that he would live with throughout his personal life. Along with the pictures there are interviews with those who knew Pryor from early on and throughout his career.

The movie looks at Pryor and how he honed his craft starting with comedy that was played safe for audiences to appreciate on television shows and the clubs in Vegas. Then one night Pryor lets loose and does the kind of comedy he wants to, using language that costs him his high paying Vegas position and the threat that he would never play there again. But this was what he wanted to do, this was the humor he found in the pain of his life that once unleashed touched too many and was loved by them as well. These stories were ones that some could relate to and others laughed at while feeling for the man.

As his career progressed Pryor was asked by Mel Brooks to help him write the successful BLAZING SADDLES. What was interesting to me here was that the black jokes were ones Brooks wrote while some of the more intellectual jokes came from Pryor. But success here too came with a problem as Brooks push to have Pryor play the lead role was shot down by Warner Brothers who wanted a name actor, Cleavon Little, for the part. Without clout at the time Brooks lost the battle and Pryor the part.

But it didn't set him back near as far as it would some. Instead Pryor began releasing comedy albums of his live performances that sold higher than any comedy album in years. Through those albums he became a name to be reckoned with and Hollywood came knocking at his door. His live performances on film took in astronomical amounts at the box office. He soon began a string of films alongside Gene Wilder that brought both of them fame and fortune. He was riding the crest of the wave until his personal demons brought him down to earth once again.

Pryors private life had numerous ups and downs. Married seven times to five women, Pryor lived a lifestyle that couldn't be contained. Various bouts of drug addiction had him in a tailspin more than once. Then one night while freebasing cocaine, Pryor lit himself on fire, resulting in third degree burns over more than half of his body. The consensus was that he wouldnt make it through the night but he survived and came out stronger than before.

Most of this is well known. Most of what Ive written so far as I go back over it are things that many of you know. There can be no spoiler alert to a biographical documentary where we know the beginning, middle and end of the story. So let me stop telling the story that is so well done in this film. Instead let me talk about the quality of the documentary itself rather than its subject matter for a bit.

The film does a great job of bringing the story of Pryor to life for those who don't know him or know of him. Unfortunately there is a generation out there that falls into this category. With this film perhaps it will give them the impetus to seek out his films, CDs and live performances to discover how funny he could be and how funny he remains. At the same time I hope they realize that there was more to his humor than his language. Far too many comedians think thats what made him funny when the truth is it was the life that he brought to his characters as well as his being able to turn his tragic early existence into humor that made him hilarious. Knowing more about his life from this film should help to make that clear.

The combination of stills and live footage alongside comments made by those who knew him works well in this case. From various wives who lived with him to managers he kept or quit, all loved the man and speak well of him here. Those who worked with him or who got to know him speak highly of him as well. All show the deepest concern that they had for him when he went down those dark roads of the soul. And each of them displays the loss they have felt with his death.

If you don't know Pryor I would highly recommend this movie as a jumping on point. Then go find a copy of SILVER STREAK. Then WHICH WAY IS UP? followed by STIR CRAZY. Add in BUSTIN LOOSE and RICHARD PRYOR: LIVE IN CONCERT and my guess is youll wind up a fan.",1428537600,,4801,4.319644839067703

6788647,5,B00P6WX57M,"Back in December I reviewed a 53-minute documentary DVD titled ""Richard Pryor: Icon"" and pointed out the people interviewed were not part those who he spent most of his life with and the clips used were basically from some concert films.  I guessed that the Pryor Estate was not involved. Obviously I was right because now comes this wonderfully insightful documentary on Pryor which aired on Showtime but is now making it's BD and DVD debut with a significant amount of bonus interviews.  The  93-minute film - by Emmy Award winning director Marina Zenovich had the full cooperation of the Pryor Estate and was co-produced by his widow Jennifer Lee Pryor - who was both his 4th and 7th wife (he married a previous wife twice too!) - and includes some amazing archival material including tv footage that never aired (because of censors).

Pryor's humor was what got him through a rough childhood. He was raised in a brothel, where his father was a pimp, his mother a prostitute and his grandmother was the madam. (There's a priceless clip from the Mike Douglas Show where Pryor appears with his grandmother.  There are interviews with his many lawyers and managers as well as two of his wives and his son Richard Jr. Celebrity interviews come from the late Robin Williams, Whoopie Goldberg, Bob Newhart and Mel Brooks - who explains how Pryor was originally to star in ""Blazing Saddles"" and tells why the studio made him replace Pryor with Clevon Little. His drug problems are discussed opening and there is film of Pryor in his last days, after suffering from MS. He died in 2006 at age 65. If you think that the ""Live on Sunset Strip"" concert film was Pryor at his best, you'll really be surprised at the backstory behind it (I won't reveal it here - no spoilers from me.)

The BD contains 35 minutes of bonus material consisting of eight interviews. There are interesting stories from Brooks, Goldberg, Lily Tomlin, Jennifer Lee Pryor, and David Banks (co-writer on  The Richard Pryor Show). Quincy Jones - who gets, maybe, 30 seconds in the film. Compares comedy with jazz and Willie Nelson - who is not even shown in the film - talks about his friend Richard.  Comedian David Steinberg is the last bonus interview and he sums it up by saying: ""If Bill Cosby was the Duke Ellington of comedy, Richard was Charlie Parker"".

THIS is the consummate Richard Pryor biography and anyone who loved his comedy (complete with all the expletives - no bleeping here) will love this BD and DVD. (I received a copy in advance of release date for purposes of an independent review.)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6788661,3,B00P6WX57M,"As one of Richard Pryor's Plastic / Burn Surgeons  back then, and the physician describing the extent of his  injuries in this documentary, now over 35 years later, I still recall his stoic demeanor; his courage in the face of continuous and horrific pain; and the humor he brought to other burn patients throughout his seven weeks, and as many surgeries, while  under our care in the Sherman Oaks Community Hospital Burn Center.
  One additional important factor also comes to mind: it was the silent vigil kept by actor Stan Shaw, who was  always present just outside the Unit, throughout the  time Richard spent under our care.
  I remain convinced that, in addition to the superb nursing care he received, Stan's continued prayerful presence truly enabled Richard  to survive his life-threatening ordeal.

6788663,4,B00P6WX57M,"A seminal force in American comedy for 25 years and for a shorter period, in film, Richard Pryor's influence is not hard to calculate. He is easily on the Mount Rushmore of American comedians. ""Omit the Logic,"" which is a term used by one of his friends who is interviewed, to refer to an attempt to understand Pryor, provides a sign post for his creative and destructive behavior, in and out of the spotlight. I found the documentary to be mostly revelatory, compassionate and insightful. Of Pryor's many wives (he had 5; or 7, he remarried two wives), only one is interviewed and none of his children, which to me is more telling about the production than the subject. No doubt he was beloved and difficult. But his former manager, lawyer, fellow comedians, among others, wax nostalgic and philosophical about his pioneering performing and disjointed personal life. His break from a standardized, mainstream style in the late 60s, that proved unfulfilling, while lucrative, highlight his boldness and penchant for risk. When he dug into his soul and history on stage, he set the tone for the confessional, personal storytelling that pushed comedy from jokes and gags, into the realm of high art and socially significant commentary.

I would recommend this film for insight into Pryor and what made him tick. It features some performance footage, but not much. As well, it doesn't have very much of his film work footage, perhaps due to copyright issues. That being said, it is well done and inspiring.",1443225600,,1503,4.917322834645669

6788665,3,B00P6WX57M,"Watching the parade of comedy heavyweights and cultural heroes assembled for the biographical documentary Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic, my mind wandered to the roast of Pryor by the cast of his 1977 NBC television show. (The unedited version is on YouTube.) As you watch him being flayed by the largely unknown group that included future stars like Tim Reid, Robin Williams, Marsha Warfield, Sandra Bernhard and John Witherspoon  as usual, Pryor was ahead of the times  you cant wait for him to get to the microphone and take revenge. When he does, he ad-libs a 13-minute rejoinder thats as cruel and foul (and homophobic) as you might fear and as coruscatingly funny as you could hope.

In Marina Zenovichs workmanlike Omit the Logic, which played at the Tribeca Film Festival and has its television premiere on Friday on Showtime, Pryor doesnt get to talk back. Its too bad, because as Mr. Williams, Lily Tomlin, Bob Newhart, Whoopi Goldberg, Mel Brooks, Jesse  Luckily, for the viewer and for Ms. Zenovich, some of Pryors associates provide a language and a perspective closer to his own. Describing his friends tough childhood, the writer David Banks says of several of Pryors male relatives: Im talking about, not no play pimps. Real pimps. Them guys would pimp a Barbie doll. The stuntman, bodyguard and adviser Rashon Khan recalls the moment when Pryor, just before he set himself on fire in 1980, watched film of a self-immolating Vietnamese monk and said admiringly, He didn't even flinch.

Ms. Zenovich also benefits, as you might expect, from clips of Pryor at work, though not that many could be shoehorned into the documentarys 84 minutes. There are some familiar moments from the concert films, including the great heart attack routine in Richard Pryor: Live in Concert, but she wisely emphasizes less well-known material. Scenes of Pryor as a Jackson, Quincy Jones and others pay respectful, sometimes unctuous tribute to Pryors comic genius, youd like him to have the last word. It would make things a whole lot livelier. young, physically commanding Bill Cosby imitator in the early 1960s are revelatory; so are clips of talk-show appearances with Johnny Carson and Dinah Shore in which he calmly discusses his use of a certain racial epithet in a way that would be unthinkable on television today.

Omit the Logic (the title comes from a line by Mr. Banks: Sometimes to understand Richard, you had to first omit logic) is the second presentation in Showtimes Sho Closeup documentary series, the latest front in the channels war with HBO for pay-cable supremacy. Ms. Zenovich has been on both sides of the battle: her best known film, Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, played on HBO in 2009.

She begins Omit the Logic with a segment on Pryors near death in the self-inflicted cocaine-related fire in 1980 before proceeding with a chronological account of his life and career. The films inevitable compressions, made worse by the amount of empty, self-congratulatory celebrity blathering, mean that every Pryor fan will have omissions to complain about. But the best strategy is probably to sit back and enjoy whats there  if nothing else, Ms. Zenovich has saved us the trouble of hunting around the Internet. Pryors unassailable strength of mind is present in every moment, no more so than in a brief clip from his later years. Frail, in a wheelchair because of the multiple sclerosis that would lead to his death in 2005, he describes a conversation with his penis, which, he announces, has died. It looked at me like I was crazy. I said, Whats wrong with you? It said, Its not me, its you.  Like all of his comedy, its actually completely logical.",1434585600,2,3670,4.925566343042071

I also saw Richard in a small club one night in L.A. it was so funny I was crying and begging him to stop because my side was hurting from laughing so hard. I love comedy and comedians and growing up in Los Angeles I made regular pilgrimages to The Comedy Store  to see stand up artists. I have seen a ton of big names; David Letterman, Robin Williams, Richard Belzer, J J Walker. Eddie Murphy, Marsha Warfield,  etc. but no one could compare to Richard Pryor he was truly funny. I knew a lot about his drug use back in the day and the time he shoot up his wife's car but most of the comedians I saw live used drugs or drank heavily, I guess that was something which kind of went with the territory. I even heckled Richard Belzer once onstage and they shut him down. Pryor was a master of comedy and I do not think even Chris Rock or Kevin Hart can hold a candle to Richard.
