8218173,3,B000VD9QHE,"I wasn't aware that Region 2 DVDs won't play on most USA players.  The disk has a few scratches on it, but I have no way to watch it, so I have no way of telling if it's defective or not.  In the future, I think all DVD sales should have a disclaimer clearing stating Region 2+ coded disks won't play on most USA players.",1286323200,,321,3.923076923076923
