1792638,5,B00006SFJ7,"If I were paying for ""The Dentist"" alone, this DVD would be worth it. At such a low price (at the time I bought it) you cannot go wrong. As a previous reviewer said, the Dentist bit is hilarious every time. He was a genius of comedy. A special note: obtain his two collections and this DVD,and you probably will not need any others.",1272153600,16,332,4.203125
1792639,5,B00006SFJ7,"W.C. Fields is one of the old time greats!  Just a great laugh!  I can see ""The Dentist"" a million times and I still lose it - it's great.  All of his films are great as far as my husband and I are concerned.",1237766400,11,208,3.6818181818181817
1792640,5,B00006SFJ7,"This set comprises ""The Dentist"", ""The Golf Specialist"" and ""The Fatal Glass of Beer"".

The quality of the dvd is relatively decent.

If you're looking for W.C. Fields shorts and are on a budget this isn't a bad place to start.

If you want to know anything else about these three short films check the

""Criterion"" collection of these classics.",1157068800,49,345,4.7
1792641,1,B00006SFJ7,"I have always been a pretty big fan of W.C Fields, which is what prompted the purchase of this item.  Viewing this soporific collection of three 20 odd minute shorts was a total waste of time.  I actually did not laugh once during any of the shorts.  I suppose that Fields was honing his craft at this time (1932) because most of his later work was a laugh riot.
Definitely pass this one up.",1044403200,2,391,4.256756756756757

1792659,5,B00006SFJ7,"WC was an all time classic, comedic genius! I just got the DVD and watched it right away, and I forgot how funny the Man was.
So many subtle innuendos and sight gags! If You want to laugh for the first time, or laugh again at the Man's humor, buy the DVD.
 It is worth much more than the bargain price I paid.",1431820800,,309,3.9047619047619047

1792689,5,B00006SFJ7,"Three of my favorite w.c field classics. For the time this was really risque stuff-especially the ""dentist"" sketch. He was vaudeville and everyone including the ladies were a hoot!  Listen carefully to his on time remarks carefully and you will get the jokes.
  Just received this dvd and they did a really good job of cleaning up the video and audio. I have seen other copies that you could barely watch due to the lousy reproduction but i was really impressed with this one.",1379116800,11,476,4.642857142857143
1792690,2,B00006SFJ7,"Were not as funny as I remember from 1955.  Nevertheless Fields was a genius.  I read his biography.  He came from the streets as a kid, and with his wits and dedication became an excellent juggler, card player, and golfer.  His humor just can naturally it seems",1377993600,,262,4.51063829787234
1792691,5,B00006SFJ7,"With a combination of site gags and brutal humor, W.C. Fields was probably the funniest man of his time. No one else could get away with kicking a dog and even a small child. These shorts are a perfect place for an intro. of the ""Great Man"". And yes, he did drink a lot.",1370822400,2,270,4.018518518518518

1792696,5,B00006SFJ7,"Three Shorts (W C Fields, 1930-33)

""The Dentist"" (1930), ""The Golf Specialist"" (1932) and ""The Fatal Glass of Beer"" (1933). Quite reasonable copy. The shorts, as ever, hilarious, like in the sequence of the dentist father asking his teenage daughter: Where is my newspaper? Answer: You're sitting on it. Next: Where are my golf clubs - You just fell over them &c. Fields acknowledges the information like he had never asked the question, with some mildly mumbling approval.
