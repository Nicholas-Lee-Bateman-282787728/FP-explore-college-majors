I guess they stole it from an airing that TCM had. I like the film because I saw it when it first came out. It was the second feature with ""I Want To Live."" The problem is the price, too damn high. I was hoping for a better print.",1313539200,,364,3.8026315789473686
4374339,1,B004GYKNN0,"I wish I had read the reviews here, before I bought this disc;-- however, I got it from Deep Discount (because it was almost $4.00 cheaper there), and I hadn't seen the reviews of the actual Cheezy Flicks disc.

I already have this film on VHS tape from Sinister Cinema --I purchased it directed from Sinister Cinema back in the 1990s-- and quite frankly, their print is pretty good.

I recently bought this Cheezy Flicks DVD, because it said it was ""digitally restored.""
I played the disc as soon as it arrived.
In the opening, it actually had a ""warning"" saying that this was ""copyrighted"" material, and you could go to jail for copying it, etc., etc.

Then, as it played, a TV logo appeared!
It turns out that Cheezy snatched this film from WCAU-TV in Philadelphia, Channel 10 (who's logo appears frequently on screen)!

I guess any possible ""copyright"" didn't concern Cheezy, who had no qualms about stealing it themselves, from another source!
In any case, ""The Lost Missile"" is in the public domain.
Cheezy not only steals, but it lies, too.

BTW, the print on this disc looks just as you would expect a home-made TV-snatch to look like....

As another reviewer here mentioned, when Cheezy ""joins"" the tape from both sides of a commercial break, the dialog gets cut,-- and so must some of the film, itself.

My rating: RIPOFF

My advice: buy it from Sinister Cinema.",1306454400,9,1372,4.6875
4374340,1,B004GYKNN0,Buyer BEWARE!! I gave this movie (THE LOST MISSLE) one star just for the fact that it was finally out on dvd. For a film that was supposedly digitally remastered it's one of the worse transfers I've ever seen. Right from the opening prolog to the very end the film looks to be always sligtly out of focus. If this is what cheezyflicks calls remastering then they better go back to school and learn how to do it. Outside of being out of focus thru the whole film the audio has a hum thru the whole picture. And I got the impression that there where some scenes missing from the piture. In watching the picture I felt I was watching a poor tape transfer. I never felt once that I was watching a transfer from a print. Hopefully this film will resurface in MOD format from the studios Vault Collections where you know it was actually taken from a print. Now my biggest complaint about this transfer was at the 25 minute and 50 second mark in the film when lo and behold in the lower left hand corner of the picture what appears is the logo for WCAU-TV Channel 10 Philadelphia Pa. Now what that was doing there? I'll let you the reader figure out. It just tells me where this copy was taken from. Cheezyflicks should be ashamed of itself for pawning this off on the puplic. AS for myself I'll never buy anything with there name on it again. So once again I say BUYER BEWARE.,1303430400,9,1370,4.293436293436294

4374342,1,B004GYKNN0,"Well, did i get taken. $12.95 for a TAPED TV PRINT with missing sound!!! This is the last time I will buy a movie from the CHEEZY FLICKS label. You even get the staation logo in this DVD so you will know they taped it from TV and did a muddy recording to DVD. Where they cut the commercials out, you have missing sound. If you wish to see this movie go to IMDB and then to FanCast and watch it. Irt is 100 times more clearer than this garbage. AMAZON - do yourself a favor and DO NOT carry the Cheezy Flicks DVD's. Your customers will be much happier. If I could rate this ZERO I would!",1301529600,41,586,3.9745762711864407
4374343,2,B004GYKNN0,"I saw this movie as a young child only once and thought it pretty scary. When I saw it was being released on DVD I was on the edge as to by it or not. I watched on HULU
and thought the picture was worth getting.
What I got was very muddy, not at all like what I saw. The distributor - Cheesy Ficks (?) must have gotten a very bad copy of a VHS to make this transfer.
I will keep it because I want the film but I will get another copy with a better picture as soon as possible.",1301529600,19,476,3.676470588235294
4374344,4,B004GYKNN0,"The Lost Missile relies on stock footage (you see the same B-66 take off at least 3 times in the ""maximum defense"" montage) and EXTREMELY limited animation/rotoscoping, but if you can get past that, the story is surprisingly good right up until the ""this is the macguffin that will save us, so we'll ship it without a proper military escort"" plot device near the end (the same stupidity as seen in War of the Worlds).

Oddly, the science behind the story isn't all that flaky. By its nature, a starship is a de facto weapon of mass destruction. If it were knocked into an exceptionally low orbit (as happens in the first five minutes), whatever protects the ship from interstellar gas, dust, and radiation (assume it's a whopping STRONG magnetic field) would raise holy ned with the atmosphere as it plows through -- the killer heat from the missile isn't simply the heat of reentry, it's a byproduct of the stardrive. We learn very little about The Lost Missile (mostly just the incredible destruction its unplanned ball-of-twine orbit would do). Lee Gordon (Producer) didn't even pay for a model of the missile; instead, Lester Wm. Berke (Director) used and reused and re-reused (etc., etc.) the same pitifully few drawings of the interloper (in order of frequency: one shot from the side passing left-to-right, one shot 30 off face-on, one shot from above -- used in conjunction with the most destructive wake you will probably ever see done for $100 or less).

Some striking features: the LACK of a monster -- The Lost Missile is deadly beyond belief (unless it's stopped, it will kill everybody on Earth, but it wasn't intentional); the heavy-handed, but necessary actions of the Civil Defense wardens; the way the secretaries bypass military restrictions via the old girl's network; the relentless music that conveys the unstoppable nature of the threat; and the ""happy"" ending (SPOILER: we survive) that isn't happy -- it shows the cold equations of human sacrifice.

If you can't wait for the DVD, you can watch it on Hulu:&nbsp;",1299542400,22,2037,4.898550724637682
4374345,5,B004GYKNN0,"It is a Masterpiece.  See it, under any circumstances

Seeing the film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it. The black-and-white cinematography has not aged as color would. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of 'The Lost Missile' is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is that the government is protecting us.

Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both story and saga.

To watch it is to experience steadily mounting delight, as you realize the filmmakers have taken enormous risks, and gotten away with them.

A true Masterpiece.",1414195200,,1036,4.797752808988764

4374347,2,B004GYKNN0,"saw this in a theater when i was about. 12 yo,scarrier back then,commical and a very low budget production with crappy special effects,cant do much with a rocket i on a string. and a puff of smoke,as they say you cant go back. interesting in ideas",1396396800,,247,4.391304347826087
4374348,2,B004GYKNN0,"Well lets get it right. The movie itself is a decent 50's horror dealing with yet another threat from space.  And its an okay flick and actually pretty good for a kid to watch. I saw it first when I was about 8. Its got thrills, suspense, looming deadlines, radioactivity, you know, all the stupid stuff that made the 50's what they were. And all now on a crisp new (illegal copy for sale by Amazon in the public domain) DVD.  Thats right, I see it as illegal.  The two stars are not for the movie, but for the copy of it.  This is a TV copied movie.  First taped on a VHS, including the commercial edits (you know with the ""rainbow"" shimmer when the machine comes out of pause) and then the station logo yet no less, then transferred to DVD, then sold to us. Well I fought fire with fire.  TCM actually ran the film twice with a vastly improved copy and retains a good contrast in the black and white and definitely lacks the commercial edits.  I copied it and put the new DVD into the original DVD movie box.  Unfortunately, I did end up paying $8+ for the case. But oh well.  So beware, if you buy this film, you're getting some Pennsylvania TV station's VHS copy.  But if you have to, I guess you have to. All I can say is you'd be better off if you pushed Turner to run it again, copy it and make your own case.  That way you can view Robert Loggia be someone other than Elfago Bacca, or Frank Lopez.  Dont say you weren't warned.",1391472000,,1435,4.159420289855072
4374349,1,B004GYKNN0,"This is not only a realy bad film, it is also copied off of a TV broadcast. The TV logo pops up about halfway into the movie. Pieces of dialogue are also missing.

4374352,4,B004GYKNN0,"As a nine year old  sitting in front the black and white on a cold snowy day in Wichita. Watching this movie, I  was frightened by the prospect of a lost missile streaking over Wichita.with it's airbase. And Boeing building B-52's and B47 bombers, and other aircraft plants, within 25 miles of my house. with  the government scaring you to death with Conelrad alerts and civil defense information, O yea,Backyard bomb shelters were all the rage(wonder what happened to folks totally worthless backyard A-bomb shelters)?

I digress. This movie was scary to a nine year old in 1959, especially a nine year old who had been indoctrinated to believe the Godless commies were just around the corner, and would attack us anyway,anyhow,anytime they could.

So its cheaply made. so what? Yes it has file shots of many different aircraft, but who cares when you're nine, or even when you're now 61.

The Lost missile brings back memories of a different and scary political climate especially for kids. I loved it in 1959 and I'm glad It's been released on DVD.",1330214400,5,1051,4.811111111111111

8429057,1,B004GYKNN0,"Actually, the movie is quite good, perhaps (if you like fifties DOD footage, as I do) even excellent.  What is really cheesy here is the production by Cheezy Flicks Entertainment, LLC.  The print they used to create the DVD is either a kinescope, or a VHS copy of the same.  In practical terms this means a blurry, slightly-out-of-focus picture with terrible contrast and uneven sound.  To add insult to injury, it is a bad print lifted from a television station (channel 10 in Philadelphia), as may be seen by the ID logo they forgot to remove from a set of frames.  And this abomination came packaged in one of the flimsiest of DVD cases, the kind that shatters the first time one presses it shut.

A solid early independent Sci-Fi movie, with capable special effects and a solid story.

The Cheezy Flicks DVD does a good job of presenting this low-budget effort. The picture is a little soft, but clear, and the sound is solid and dialogue is easily understandable.
