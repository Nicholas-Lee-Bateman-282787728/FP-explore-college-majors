8035087,1,B0002Z3QGS,"- The picture is faded.

- The acting is stiff and childish.

- The plot is ridiculous.

- Jack Palance is good in other movies made in the 90's not this which was made in the 70's.

- It's a huge waste of my money.",1302998400,2,215,3.7111111111111112
8035088,5,B0002Z3QGS,"The Cop in Blue Jeans--an amazing film of epic proportions. For 92 full minutes, you are brought on an emotional roller coaster into the heart of a ""city gone mad."" Despite being done on a low budget, the acting and special effects are surprisingly great, here. All the extra blue and green colors really bring about the feeling of a small oceanside tow. The two main characters have wonderfully developed, rich personalities that play off of eachother well.

The plot moves along at a groundbreaking pace, as the simple policeman is introduced to the evil Jack Palance...with deadly results. Overall, this is a great piece of detective filmwork, and a true testament to 1970's film making.

They may be cops, but they're guilty of being hillarious!",1136764800,4,749,4.936507936507937
8035089,3,B0002Z3QGS,"Yo, this is a funny film.  It's cheesty fun.  The ""gritty action"" is as comical as the outfits worn by the lead star, master actor Milian.  The film's score sounds like it should have been in the soundtrack for ""revenge of the pizza man"".
I enjoyed it, especially the fact that Jack Palance's face is splashed across the cover as the ""leading star"" , yet maintains like 10 minutes of screen time.  And in those whole 10 minutes or so, some hooligans spray him in the face with a can of Krylon.  It was bugged out to watch such an icon get vandalized in the mug.

I don't know how this film spawned 11 (yes, i am serious) sequals, but i guess don't understand italians from italy.  They are especially enamorerd with bohemian cops bent on justice.

The quality of this dvd is that of a vhs tape.  A guilty pleasure for those with a weird sense of humor or who are fans of Tomas Milian or those who want to see a pick pocket get cornered and beat up in a toilet stall during a soccer game.",1129248000,4,987,4.207446808510638
