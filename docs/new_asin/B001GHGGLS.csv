8305378,3,B001GHGGLS,"I am torn in my opinion of this DVD because the information was helpful but the production quality was poor for the price.  The DVD production is identical to their youtube.com work.  The DVD tracks are divided into individual subjects.  I think a person who had never heard of EFT would not know what was going.  An introduction to EFT principles would have been helpful.  I thought that the Childerley's had discovered new EFT tapping points when I saw the menu of different ""taps"" like the Belly Tap or the Thigh Tap.  What I discovered after viewing the video is that these taps were addressing different EFT phrases about feeling safe and loving your body.  I felt the Mirror Tap technique was useful and interesting.  I just wish more effort had been put into production.",1233878400,13,777,4.703703703703703
