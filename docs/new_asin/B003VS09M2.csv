There is little doubt that Bobby Knight's Indiana Hoosiers wore a target, regardless of how good or bad they were going in, and generally received an opponent's best efforts. This scenario played itself out once again in this visit to the hornet's nest of Assembly Hall. Illinois would just not be denied on this day and eventually swarmed over a very good Indiana team. History teaches us, though, that this Hoosiers' squad was actually a year away as four of the starting five for this game would return to win a national championship in 1980-81 led by Isiah Thomas.
A little side note here on these TVS HOME VIDEO series games. I am often shocked at the quick, up-and-down pace these older games were played at. I find myself falling into this mindset of pre-shotclock college basketball being a slower game and it's just not the case. A lot of these games have a much better flow than anything you will see today. It's very interesting to see and compare the different era's style.",1307923200,,1122,4.700507614213198
