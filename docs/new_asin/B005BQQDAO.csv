8464119,5,B005BQQDAO,"Ok, I have a weak spot for brunettes. Sophia runs a close 2nd to my favorite actress growing up- Raquel Welch. The difference being that Sophia had more acting talent throughout her acting years. Raquel got better when she had gotten over her early contracts as she learned that movie producers used her for her gorgeous body / looks only. This Sophia Loren BLU-RAY collection has a great selection of her older films. Yes, there are many others you can buy as single movies but this is very nice collection you'd want to start with. The movie quality could be improved when Kino Lorber ever spends a little more money to upgrade their scanning equipment, but for now, these are very nice films considering their age. I don't mind a little grain on film for older movies. The sound quality is also very good. 3 of the films use Italian Dolby TrueHD 2.0 except for Boccaccio `70 which uses Italian: DTS-HD Master Audio Mono. Even with a few weaknesses, I still rate this collection 5 Stars.",1454976000,3,989,4.625
