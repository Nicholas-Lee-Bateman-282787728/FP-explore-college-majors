8030757,2,B0002QO4BS,"This is a BBC mini series from circa 1992. A film crew is making a movie about Ezekiel Oliphant,  a witch hunter during the 17th century English civil war. Jamie Matheson (Peter McEnery) is an advisor on the set and script writer who has the habit of changing scenes after they have been shot, writing on the fly. He gets help from Alan Oakfield (Alan Howard) an expert on Oliphant who had his wife and mistress both put to death as witches.

Jamie starts to assume the character of Ezekiel and it appears history is going to repeat itself. It includes twists and head fakes.

The acting in the series left a lot to be desired. This is maybe the worst performance of Lisa Harrow. I only kept watching the film because it appears to have been written so Judy Campbell can undress. I imagine this has been re-released based on the modest success of ""The Witch"" from the same period, sort of.

8030760,1,B0002QO4BS,"I have seen better examples of witch- and mage-craft in movies like The Craft, and shows like Charmed.  The episodes are too short, and there are too many crammed together on one DVD.  I would recommend you get the book ""Ceremonial Magic & The Power of Evocation"" by Joseph Lisiewski, PhD instead.",1115337600,17,297,4.6923076923076925
