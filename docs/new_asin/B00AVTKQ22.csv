8558089,5,B00AVTKQ22,"That a three-for-one format is a great bargain goes without saying. Especially as these are all virtually classics. Prints are
sharp, audio excellent on my three-some (I imagine an all sets). My favorite is DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, which has about
every dramatic element from humor to action to pathos to social comment.

Although I have all three movies on laser disk, this was a prime opportunity to upgrade to DVDs;
a great bargain and really upgrades my watching pleasure, and that's what it's all about, isn't it?

8558090,5,B00AVTKQ22,I enjoyed seeing the nostalgic movies with Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals acting.  I am proud to see such talented people in movies and how educated they are off the screen.,1378857600,,179,4.774193548387097
