7513695,1,B017RR5HW4,"Another 15 Minutes of Total Screen Time Bruce Willis Movie That is Just Terrible

When I first read the blurb for Extraction I assumed it was The Cold Light of Day, just re-titled. But no it actually is a completely different movie where Bruce Willis has about 15 minutes of screen time overall, he's a CIA agent who is kidnapped and his son (Kellen Lutz) gets involved in CIA fieldwork for the first time. This one differs by the fact that at the beginning of the film Bruce calls home and tells his son to get his mother out of the house, unfortunately he's called too late and the mother is shot, the son is directed by Bruce up the stairs to his dresser where a gun awaits. The son is however too scared to shoot the assassin but luckily this takes place in the Hollywood alternative version of reality where the guy Bruce rang before the son can arrive on scene in that 30 seconds or so of time and shoot the bad guy. Now ten years later and twenty or something, the son has learnt to fight, handle a gun and eagerly awaits acceptance to become a field agent like his dad, spending his meantime in a Czech CIA admin role. However they aren't that keen and have rejected him for the third time. But when dad goes missing in Newark, he's going to fly back to Newark,and like a field agent whether the CIA like it or not.

Up until the final 20 minutes or so (stuff before we get to the nightclub), it scrapes by as a three star movie. There's a bit of fighting in a biker bar and stuff like this. Obviously to get a job in the CIA public service if you are female you must also be young and hot. But like most films where the hero goes into hand to hand combat, you're just thinking aren't these supposed to be outlaw bikers, aren't we in America? Don't American bikers have guns that you could easily kill the most skilled martial arts guy? But it's not just the CIA that trains people with mad fighting skills, everyone in a factory also has these abilities.

Spoilers for the final 20 minutes - What kind of kidnapper doesn't notice a red sports car that is constantly revving, squealing tyres, drifting around corners, and basically being driven as if a hoon was behind the wheel, in their rear view mirrors? If you're going to tie up your kidnap victim, why would you only tie them up by one arm to an overhead pipe. Surely even the dumbest of all kidnappers would realise it's a probably a good idea to tie both arms up so the other isn't free to hit you, untie the other arm and things like this. Also if you're a kidnap victim and you're going to burn some guys' face with hot steam by holding their head into it with your thighs (especially when your not wearing pants), surely those thighs and your other parts in the vicinity would also be getting scolding hot steam on them and third degree burns like his face is. Sure betrayal, switching sides is something maybe plausible for one person, but everyone else who has been fighting beside them in the movie up to that point isn't just going to switch sides because that person does.

You expect a Bruce Willis prominently on the DVD cover movie these days to have less than 15 minutes of screen time, it's just how he rolls these last ten years or so. But you also expect that movie to make some sense when it's over. Extraction doesn't.",1501113600,,3301,4.336569579288026

Second, the characters are all appearing to be going through the motions. Third, I will totally bypass Bruce Willis' part in this since he just seems to do movies for a paycheck now, he was deadpan and didn't show up at all. Gina Carano, I did like her in this but I'm not sure they knew how to use her in the movie, the tough partner or the damsel in distress?

7514274,1,B017RR5HW4,"Heres the story synopsis:
When a terrorist group kidnaps retired CIA field operative Leonard Turner (Bruce Willis), his son Harry Turner (Kellan Lutz), a government analyst who has been repeatedly turned down for field service, launches his own unsanctioned rescue operation. While evading highly skilled operatives, deadly assassins, and international terrorists, Harry finally puts his combat training to the test in a high stakes mission to find his father and to stop a terrorist plot.

The Premise is Good
I won't lie, the family rescue premise is a good one.  Some great families have had excellent action movies.  For example, A Good Day to Die Hard ($304 million) and Spy Kids ($147 million).  Both solid performing box office hits.  Extraction didn't even bring in 1 million.

No, that isn't a typo.

This movie didn't even clear $1 million.

Tell me how you can afford Bruce Willis, Kellan Lutz, and Gina Carano on that kind of budget?  And speaking of budget, it has not been disclosed.  You can search the world wide web but nobody will tell you how much this bomb cost.

Theyre probably too ashamed.

Id be ashamed too.

You know who else should be ashamed?  The Writers (Max Adams, Umair Aleem) and the Stunt Coordinator (Simon Rhee).

Reason #1 for Shaming: Rip Offs
The story opens with Bruce Willis being held hostage.  I, like everyone else who has come to expect a certain degree of badassery from Bruno, thought Oh, great!  Kick ass in the first scene!  Theres a hook.

Well, it would have been.

If it weren't a ripoff straight out of John Wick.  Heres the thing  John Wick was such a well-written movie that they didn't even have to show him killing three men in a bar with a pencil for viewers to really grasp the level of badassery present.  Do yourself a favor and see John Wick instead of Extraction.

You cant tell me the three years of age difference between Bruce Willis and Keanu Reeves is the faulty factor here.  Bruce still has the chops for action.  The problem is the writers wrote a hack scene and the stunt coordinator phoned it in.

Reason #2 for Shaming: Kellan Lutz is Too Pretty to Fight
Now lets talk about Kellan Lutz.  He is an Expendable but the bulk of his action is on a motorcycle, with a helmet on, and a stunt man driving.  Hes window dressing.  Sure, hes buff and he compares a bathroom fight scene in extraction to a similar scene in a Bourne movie (another ripoff) but Im here to tell you  Jason Bourne he aint!  Again, I blame the stunt coordinator.  Fight scenes are a dance.  If you can learn to dance, you can fight for a camera.  Simon Rhee may be a great stunt man, but he sucks at choreography.

Reason #3 for Shaming: Gina Carano Isnt Allowed to Fight
But what about Gina Carano? You may ask, and youd be right to.
Shes not just window dressing, shes a certified badass with MMA wins to prove it.  She can fight.  You know who else can fight?  Michelle Rodriguez.  They had a great fight in Fast & Furious 6.  Gina did not have a good fight in Extraction.  She had a couple opportunities, but the writers and director squandered them and made her a sissy.  Any movie that makes Gina Carano a sissy is WRONG.

Reason #4 for Shaming: The CIA Hit Ordered on Harry as Soon as He Left
Sure, Harry goes off the reservation to save his dad and his ex girlfriend decides to go off the reservation to help him, but the CIA doesnt waste millions of dollars training badasses just to put a bullet in their head as soon as they stray from their original orders.

And apparently Harrys boss had no idea he was a badass.

I have to call Bull*hit on these two points.

So theres a whole lot of shame wrapped up in those 82 minutes of your life that you will neither enjoy or get back.  Not to mention the cost of the rental.  If you ask me, they should be paying people to watch this instead of getting paid.

This Movie is a Mystery
I know.  It says its an action/thriller, but I found it a mystery.

Why?

Exactly.

Why would Bruce Willis, the patron saint of Christmas explosions, agree to be in a lousy movie written by a B-list horror movie writer with no street cred?  Sure, Carano and Lutz would sign on to an action/thriller with Bruce Willis.  Who wouldnt?  But Bruce let them down.

I suspect that the young hotshot agent at William Morris was desperate to make this movie because the writer had gone all Kathy Bates and held his mother in a quiet little house on a sleepy, snow-covered road in Podunk, Maine, threatening to break her feet with a sledgehammer.  I suspect this young hotshot found a way to compromise Bruce Willis agent there at William Morris and they made Bruno get on board.  Sure, he might have balked at first, but maybe he had a gambling debt with a certain shylock who was growing very anxious for Bruce to pay up so he got the agency to pay his debt, spare his pinkie fingers from big knives, and all he had to do was spend six weeks on a movie.

Then they brought on Carano in hopes shed get some Fast & Furious audience to crossover and Lutz for the Expendables crossover audience.

On paper, it all looks good 

My recommendation: Put a 500-foot cordon around this movie and don't ever touch it.",1464566400,12,5178,4.447284345047923

The female lead, Gina Carano, might be able to act better than she showed here but maybe not.  She has done some modeling and has a career as a martial arts fighter.  She did have a couple of good looks so I give her the benefit of the doubt.  A competent director could direct around her limitations as is done from time to time when dealing with models.  There is zero flame between her and her supposed love interest, Kellan Lutz.  Lutz caused hearts to flutter in his role of a vampire in the Twilight movies.  No flutter here.  Again, a competent director can often soften the limitations of his actors.  Steve C. Miller didn't seem to notice.

Grade ""A"" on production values brings it up to a 2 star experience, but the script was cliche and the performances wooden. The scenes where the rookie wannabe field agent trained were unrealistic and the only things he even bothered to train for was punching and shooting. A movie about a field agent is better if he uses his brain or maybe uses little psychology. I actually got this because I wanted to see Gina Carano, I liked her in Haywire. But she hasn't progressed as an actor much, or was trying too hard to emulate a tightly restrained Bruce Willis trope. The villain were all caricatures, but sort of clean as though they had just come from wardrobe. C'mon...a guy walks into a biker bar and intends to beat these rather clean and nice smelling bikers into giving him information?  And the bartender is a match for any beautiful runway model, what's she doing there?  With a little more tweaking and possibly injecting some humor into the script, it could have been predictable (not necessarily a sin) but still interesting. How about threatening the biker's bikes, which our character totally ignored, instead of unsuccessfully trying to throw them a beating? Then at the end holding up an obviously tear gas grenade and having them act as though they thought it was an anti-personnel grenade? Oh jeez...so many opportunities for improvement. Sorry if that was a spoiler, but it really was so predictable, there isn't any way to spoil the plot twists and turns. The movie goes exactly where you thought it would go. (Also, continuity guy....Willis is restrained by black zip ties in the first scene which mysteriously turn to white zip ties 30 seconds later. Sorta forgivable, except there was a medium tight focus on his hands two times during the scene so the lack of continuity was glaring. A minor point, but it actually made me stop and go back rather than finish to scene, because I was more curious to find out if I was right about the continuity scene than whether Willis would get out of a tight spot.

With the opening sequence to the movie EXTRACTION out on DVD this week I had high hopes. Could it be that Bruce Willis would once again reign supreme in an action outing? I mean in his last 10 movies released only 3 have done decent box office, 2 of which he was the lead actor and both sequels that did less than their original films. The rest have all been straight to DVD films that were mediocre at best. Unfortunately the opening sequence here was the best thing about the film.

The movie opens with Willis as CIA field operative Leonard Turner who has been caught and whose family is threatened. Taking out the bad guys he calls home in time to prevent his son from being killed as well but not his wife. From there we launch into an animated title sequence that is by far the best thing in this film. Its reminiscent to the classic opening title sequences from the best of the Bond films, perhaps even surpassing some of those. Unfortunately thats where the best of this picture ends.

Fast forward ten years later as Turners son Harry (Kellan Lutz) is now a new CIA agent. Stationed in Prague and training under the watchful eye of Leonards best friend Ken (D.B. Sweeney), Harry is repetitively turned down for field agent status. A new project he is assigned to involves a top secret piece of electronic equipment called CONDOR. With it whoever controls it has control of it can take down anything from power grids to phone systems. While Harry thinks hes found a lead to taking out a terrorist about to take possession of CONDOR, Ken tells him its too slim a lead and to stand down.

But then Leonard is captured while in the middle of trying to purchase CONDOR. Harry is informed and kept out because hes too close to the situation. He listens in and inserts himself into the discussion of what is going on, passing on the information as to who could be behind this, the same info ken told him wasn't strong enough. As the only lead the CIA uses it but instructs Harry to sit tight and sends him home under armed escort to insure he follows orders. Of course he escapes and sets out for Newark, NJ, where his information has led all.

Assigned to the case by the CIA is Victoria Phipps (Gina Carano), their best field agent and a former lover of Harry. She finds him in the middle of things and rather than turn him in gives him time to help her track down CONDOR before it goes live, take down the bad buys and save his father in the process. The two race against the clock trying to save the world but before it ends several twists and turns will force all to wonder just who the bad guys are and who the good are.

Sounds like a decent action film right? Well in some ways it is and others it isnt. As for the action sequences in the film they are plentiful enough and some are handled well. Others are shot so haphazardly and with far too many jump cuts that you aren't quite sure of what you're looking at, in particular most of the car chases. Carano, an up and coming action film star and former MMA fighter, is used sparingly and thats a shame as other films have used her to their advantage.

What really does the most harm in this film is a combination of the directing and the sound crew. Vocals here are not well recorded and suffer when performed poorly. Having seen both Kellan and Carano in other films I can say that they may not have achieved Oscar status just yet but are both quite capable of handling roles similar to these in past films. But here its as if this is their first time before a camera with some badly done line readings that come off amateurish at best. They can do better and have so I have to assume it was the direction that made them come off this bad.

Being a straight to DVD release I didn't have high hopes for this movie and my expectations were met. The opening sequence, as I said earlier, made me begin to rethink that position until the actual movie got about 15 minutes in. Thats sad. Then again whoever was responsible for that opening title sequence should get high praise and more work based on what is seen here alone. If there were awards for that whoever should be among the top in the business. Lets hope that person gets connected to a better project and used often.",1456876800,,4290,4.35375

7515075,3,B017RR5HW4,"Leonard Turner (Bruce Willis) is a crusty old CIA agent who may or may not be retired. He is kidnapped in Newark, along with the Condor, a device that can hack everything. Harry (Kellan Lutz) also works for the company as a desk agent in Prague. Harry had been working on the Condor, but his boss wants him home. Harry goes rogue to save his dad and the world. He teams up with his old girlfriend (Gina Carano) in New Jersey

The production was actually filmed in Alabama, except for the flyover which was Pittsburgh. There was a lot of hand to hand fighting with cliche scenes starting with the opener as Leonard is tied up and given a pen. Who didn't see that coming? The fight scenes were so-so and Gina Carano was unconvincing. The whole plot seemed weak.

Not the best Bruce Willis film out there, but better than that one where he dies early and his son has to use his cell phone (The Cold Light of Day). 2 1/2 stars
