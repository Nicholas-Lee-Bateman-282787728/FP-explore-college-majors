4962454,5,B0066E6PJO,"If you want to leave your troubles behind and go back to a time when it was 'SPOT ON' to be the good guy.....this is the guy to go to.  Heroes of a by gone era......Randolph Scott, John Wayne, Matt Dillion, etc.  Heroes kids could look up to and want to be like.  Heroes who always looked out for the little guy and stood up for and knew the difference between right and wrong.  When I have had ENOUGH of the ugliness of this world (via the news) I put in one of these movies and feel safe and happy for a moment.....all is right in the world.  It can be this way again if we all look out for one another and stick together........REJECT the hate mongers.  :''')",1340236800,36,662,4.093023255813954
4962455,5,B0066E6PJO,"I can't add much to C.R.s review other than, CARSON CITY and WESTBOUND are in color and they are all fullscreen, except WESTBOUND its widescreen. Hopefully now we can look forward to another set with THE NEVADAN,CORONER CREEK,WESTERN UNION,BELLE OF THE YUKON and others.",1332115200,19,270,5.159090909090909

4962462,5,B0066E6PJO,"FIVE GREAT RANDOLPH SCOTT WESTERNS ON INDIVIDUAL DISKS, THREE IN BLACK AND WHITE AND TWO IN COLOR, AND ALL FIVE FULL OF BELIEVABLE ACTION. FOLLOW SCOTT INTO ""BADMAN'S TERRITORY"" WHERE HE MEETS MANY LEGENDARY OUTLAWS WHILE FIGHTING A POWER HUNGRY U.S. MARSHALL. STAND BY HIM IN ""TRAIL STREET"" WHEN HE TRIES TO BALANCE THE CONFLICTING DEMANDS OF SALOON OWNERS, SHOPKEEPERS, CATTLEMEN AND HOMESTEADERS. IN ""RETURN OF THE BAD MEN"" RANDOLF RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTS THE ROLE OF LAWMAN IN THE NEWLY FORMED OKLAHOMA TERRITORY. THEN ITS OFF TO ""CARSON CITY"" TO BUILD A RAILROAD TO CONNECT THE GOLD RICH MINES OF THE AREA TO THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND BYPASS THE BANDITS WHO HAVE PLAGUED THE MINE OWNERS. FINALLY, GO ""WESTBOUND"" WITH HIM TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA GOLD REACHES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING THE  CIVIL WAR. THREE OF THESE FILMS FEATURE GEORGE ""GABBY"" HAYES AND INSTEAD OF BEING THE BUMBLING, ""COMICAL"" SIDEKICK COMMON TO EARLY WESTERNS IS INSTEAD CAST IN A STRONG, SUPPORTING ROLE. POP THE POPCORN, TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS AND ENJOY FIVE SOLID ENTERTAINING RANDOLPH SCOTT CLASSICS.",1393632000,6,1086,5.135593220338983
4962463,5,B0066E6PJO,Very enjoyable old classic movies.  Randolph Scott is a great actor .  I would recommend to anyone who likes the old westerns.,1388361600,6,126,4.681818181818182
4962464,5,B0066E6PJO,"Finally Warner Archive re-released this box set into one. There are five disks and it's all in one case and not in five separate cases. It's the same as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Randolph-Scott-The-Warner-Archive-Classics-Collection-Badman-s-Territory-Trail-Street-Return-of-the-Bad-Men-Carson-City-Westbound/dp/B0066E6PJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Randolph Scott: The Warner Archive Classics Collection (Badman's Territory / Trail Street / Return of the Bad Men / Carson City / Westbound)</a>, but this has only one case with five for the older version. So I would recommend getting this so you can save space and it would save you money from buying the movies separate. The quality of the movies are great with ""Badman's Territory"" kind of grainy some times, but is worth watching. There isn't much features except for a few Trailers and there isn't any subtitles or other languages then English.

4962465,5,B0066E6PJO,"A great selection of Randolph Scott movies. Even Though these movies have not been remastered they are in  pretty good shape for there age. My favourite of course is Carson City. Scott was my favorite western hero.

8494036,5,B0066E6PJO,"The day I received this collection, my wife and I sat down and devoured the movies which we grew up with. My father would tell me about the cowboys and Indians and being baby boomers, Westerns were number one on Saturdays and Sundays at home.  And in our current times, Westerns are hard to find. Randolph Scott, John Wayne, Audy Murphy, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Lash LaRue, Tom Mix and a host of others presented many great hours of entertainment.  Gabby Hayes was also a favorite. I am happy to have found this collection and able to feel like a kid all over again many proud and happy memories. (Sorry guys, I don't wear my double holstered 6 shooters and cowboy hat while watching them as a kid...maybe???? lol lol) A must have for any video library.",1451779200,16,753,4.489051094890511
