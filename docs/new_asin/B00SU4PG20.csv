6992845,1,B00SU4PG20,"Combine non linear story telling with endless scenes of tv newsies holding microphones and you have...what? This movie suffers from a severe
""failing to get on with it syndrome"", and substitutes teasing for legitimate suspense.  After giving it 15 minutes (way to generous) I forwarded to the
end game, which was as horrible as everything before. It was so bad that I cut my losses and watched a documentary on 911 on netflix, which contained way more value than this piece of trash.",1431388800,,483,4.819277108433735
6992846,5,B00SU4PG20,"A special movie that is different from all the other Vigilante movies. This is a movie that you will think about for days after you see it. I highly recommend this movie. For the record, I think John Doe is a hero; not a villain.",1431388800,3,229,4.111111111111111
6992847,5,B00SU4PG20,really great movie well worth  rentng,1431388800,2,37,5.166666666666667
6992848,4,B00SU4PG20,"I admit to being biased as an American that has never had anything but great good fun in the Land Down Under. John Doe was intense and never did go for the simple answers to complex questions.

I loved LAC but I thought the ending was a cop out because their is no way that the man who did all of those acts would be caught out that way. This movie didn't have the action levels since it was being told more as a documentary after the fact than as it happened but I thought Jamie Bamber was excellent. He portrays so much and does a great deal of it with only his expressions and holding tension in his face and neck.

No easy answers for anyone but I liked it. Watch it and decide for yourself.",1430697600,6,695,4.065693430656935
6992849,4,B00SU4PG20,"Surprise, wow this is not what I expected but even my wife was pleasantly surprised. Besides the actual acts of retribution carried out by the vigilante this movie also addresses what happens when a community gets sick and tired of all the crimes. This is also one of those movies that is played in reverse. It begins at the end and tells the story going backwards. It covers how the cops, the press and citizens draw sides when someone takes the law into their own hands and in so doing he saves the ones they love.  I do not believe this was ever in the movie theaters but it is clearly at the top of the direct to DVD video list.",1430524800,4,632,4.223140495867769

6992851,5,B00SU4PG20,This is an excellent movie. It is not everyday that you see a film and you continue thinking about it. It is not a perfect movie but better than the usual from the genre. Let it a try and think. Recommended.,1425513600,2,207,4.073170731707317
6992852,5,B00SU4PG20,"Edge of your seat ...really good movie , can't wait for it on Blu Ray",1425513600,,69,3.6666666666666665
6992853,4,B00SU4PG20,"The film opens with John Doe (Jamie Bamber) in jail granting an interview to a reporter (Lachy Hulme). He is accused of killing 33 people, all of which ""deserved killing."" The list included pedophiles, murderers, and wife beaters all repeat offenders. 20 minutes into the film we discover Mr. Doe was a social worker, who knew the victims or his victims. As time goes on copycat killers arise as ""Speak for the Dead"" spring up across the world.

This was an interesting film that engages the viewer with questions about justice and the legal system. At one point it equates vigilante action with war. At another point it asks, if the vigilante kills because he enjoys killing then is he a hero or part of the problem? The role of the media is criticized and questioned. The film was done rather well, and leave it to the Aussies to come up with a heartfelt slasher. Nice surprise ending too.

Perhaps the most unbelievable aspect of this film was that events that happened in Australia somehow were of interest worldwide. Like that would happen.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1422489600,7,1088,4.71578947368421
6992854,5,B00SU4PG20,"This is on one hand, your typical victim whose had enough and decides to clean up the neighbourhood of repeat violent crime offenders who the Victorian (state in Australia) prison system keep giving a slap on the wrist to and letting out of jail due to the standard overcrowding, criminals are victims too mentality and that kind of thing.  John Doe videotapes and uploads his brutal justice and has therefore become quite the hero to the public who have also had enough of victims rights being second to criminals ones.  On the other hand it is different to that norm as this isn't a trying to catch him by a reluctant to really want to homicide police department film.  We start the film off with a massive crowd outside of a court in Melbourne, were told by the TV reporter at over 100 000 people strong, waiting on Johns sentencing, loudly demanding he be set free.  The story is told as interviews with John (or his victims families) as well as flashbacks of John delving out justice, one scumbag at a time as he recounts them.  Theres also a supporter movement called Speak for the Dead whose leader is interviewed to camera throughout as well and we see what some of those followers got up to by flashbacks as well.

I quite liked the film, at first I thought the style would lessen that enjoyment but ultimately it worked.  Jamie Bamber does a good job as the vigilante as do the actors playing his victims who make them very unlikeable and therefore increase your enjoyment of seeing each of them get their comeuppance.",1422316800,11,1528,4.575091575091575
