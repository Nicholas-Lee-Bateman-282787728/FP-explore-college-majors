8134002,5,B000GRUMZK,"The complete antithesis of the typical Hollywood blockbuster, this lovely, poignant little fable in luminous black-&-white is simply one of the most memorable, moving films I've seen in a long time. A camel left behind by the circus wanders into the yard of a middle-aged Polish couple, who adopt the gentle beast as their own. At first this is a delightful surprise for everyone in town ... until too many people start to think of the money to be made from the camel, especially when kind-hearted Zygmunt refuses to exploit his beloved friend. And then the petty cruelties begin, as we see how so many people not only resent & fear anything & anyone who's the least bit different, but somehow resent anyone being happy, even though his happiness isn't harming them at all. While this is obviously a tale of human intolerance, it goes even more deeply than that, by revealing the insecurities & jealousies that consume those whose own lives are empty of empathy, compassion, imagination. This message in universally applicable, sad to say.

But there are also some tender, sweet touches: building a stable for the camel with an arched door & vaguely Arabian design, ""so he'll feel at home"" -- playing the clarinet for him -- walking the country roads with him & talking as you would to a close friend. There's a subtle but real emphasis on the kinship of other animals, who are often far better companions than many human beings.

The story reaches a bittersweet point, of course. But it doesn't end on a painful note, as the final scene set in the Krakow Zoo in winter is a transcendent, glowing moment that'll stay with you. While made for adults, this could also be a superb film for children, if they'll accept a B&W film with subtitles ... but of course a lot of adults won't accept that, either. It's their loss. A warm, thoughtful work of art like this is the reason films were invented. I'll definitely be watching it many times in the years ahead. And making the DVD even better is an interview with director-actor Jerzy Stuhr, which goes far beyond the typical Hollywood soundbite in allowing the artist to really talk about his work & his philosophy.

Most highly recommended -- but have a tissue or two handy!",1391904000,,2221,4.704370179948586
8134003,5,B000GRUMZK,"A Polish film with English subtitles, it tells the story if a camel left behind in a small village by the traveling circus.  One man adopts the animal only to cause tension in the community.  Filmed in black and white, it is a delight to watch what happens.",1374624000,,257,4.333333333333333
8134004,4,B000GRUMZK,"Wonderful movie. Though I must admit I stopped watching it a couple of times.  I didn't want to be reminded of how cruel and vindictive people can be.  But the beautiful scene at the Warsaw Zoo was worth watching it through to the end.  It still left me feeling very sad.  Jealous, resentful people will do anything to make everyone else feel as miserable as they are. But this sweet, loving couple would not let their spirit be broken.",1373846400,,436,4.481012658227848
8134005,4,B000GRUMZK,"This simple fable is beguiling on the surface level of narrating what happens when a middle-aged couple stumble into adopting an abandoned camel from a travelling circus.  And it's completely satisfying on that level But it also hints - in a manner akin to Milos Forman's ""Fireman's Ball"" - at truths about the particular society in which it's set and societies in general.  The consequences of even minor non-conformity.  Bullying. Meddlesome authority.  The latent fear of beauty and a spiteful tendency to want to punish others for their happiness.  And yet none of this is conveyed in a clumsy way.  The black and white cinematography is perfectly suited to the content and the final scene is both beautiful and touching.  It is well worth tracking down.",1329264000,,758,4.968253968253968
8134006,5,B000GRUMZK,"""The Big Animal"" is a film that grew on me. The pacing is excruciatingly slow next to Hollywood standards, and the first time you see this movie you may not be hooked. I had to watch it twice to really get it.

What appears to be a cute story about a camel showing up in the backyard of a Polish couple is much, much more. I do not want to give much away about the movie, but a sensitive viewer will naturally ask lots of questions once they mull over the details of the plot and characters. In short, the film is a perfect satire of socialist Poland, at times quite serious and other times not. If you are a fan of Kieslowski or Polish cinema, do not miss this gem.",1211328000,,666,4.083969465648855
8134007,5,B000GRUMZK,"I am thrilled to discover that ""The Big Animal"" is available on DVD. I saw it for the first time several years ago at a film festival in LA and found it moving, powerful, and highly memorable.  It seeps in on an emotional level and stays there.",1207958400,,244,4.191489361702128
8134008,2,B000GRUMZK,"Beautiful town, nicely photographed, well acted.
I think it would have been better, more interesting, and effective at 20 minutes rather than 72. There was simply not enough plot, or characterization here to make a feature.",1192924800,,223,5.222222222222222
8134009,4,B000GRUMZK,"Most people daydream as children about having an exotic pet.

But in ""The Big Animal (Duze Zwierze),"" a middle-aged Polish couple discovers that it's not as delightful as it sounds. The movie is a simple, powerful allegory written by Krzysztof Kieslowsk, filmed in luminescent black-and-white, and with a bittersweet message about narrow-minded cruelty.

The middle-aged Sawicki's are silently eating dinner, until Marysia (Anna Dymna) notices something moving out in the garden -- a camel. The next day, Zygmunt (Jerzy Stuhr) proudly parades the camel before the other townspeople, and tries to deal with government red tape -- should the camel be registered as a horse? No, you can't shoe it.

Of course, all the townspeople are initially delighted. But when they urge Zygmunt to cash in on the camel, he refuses -- he and his wife love the camel, and respect its dignity. And so slowly the small-minded citizens turn on the Sawickis and their beloved pet, with devastating results.

On one level, ""The Big Animal"" can be seen as an allegory for the Communist times in Poland. But it can also be seen as a more universal allegory about the cruelty of many people: a small-minded, cunning, greedy community can wreck something as simple as a childless couple's love for an animal.

And a lot of the movie's sadness comes from that theme, with the poor Sawickis risking everything because they just want to love their new pet. And who could be happy in such a community after seeing its ugly side? But Stuhr highlights the sweet moments as well, such as when Zygmunt plays the clarinet to the camel.  There's even some humor, when the poor guy tries to deal with all the red tape -- some sly pokes at restricting governments.

Director/actor Stuhr strips filmmaking to the bone in this -- the camerawork is straightforward without any tricks, rendered in crisp, shining black and white. And Stuhr sticks to the simple images -- Zygmunt taking the camel for long walks -- as well as pretty, bittersweet dialogue (""Nobody will do you harm, because you're free!"").

The primary cast is basically Stuhr and Dymna, who convey the innocent kindness of truly good people with amazing skill and depth. Most of the other human actors are playing typical greedy hypocrites -- they think that anything different is wrong, if it's not being used. And though he isn't technically ""acting,"" the camel deserves props for giving the film a center -- serene and dignified.

Bittersweet and charming, ""The Big Animal"" is an exquisite example of filmmaking at its most simple, with a story that will wring a few tears even from hardened moviegoers.",1177459200,6,2629,4.9164785553047405
8134010,5,B000GRUMZK,"Clearly a subtitled, B&W, slow moving film is not for everyone, but this is on my Top10 EVER film list. No flash filming here, just timeless story-telling, amazing acting and a camel that will keep you saying ""I can't believe it!"" Take a chance! You will love this movie and want to share it with lots of other people you know.",1170547200,2,327,4.377049180327869
