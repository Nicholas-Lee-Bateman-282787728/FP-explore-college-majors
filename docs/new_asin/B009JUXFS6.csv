8542272,5,B009JUXFS6,"I will watch anything with Dawn French in it. She is so clever, witty, and fun. I couldn't wait for this to come out on DVD. I saw it years ago on PBS, and have been looking for it ever since! I can't wait for other episodes to be released. Love her...",1377561600,,252,3.8653846153846154
8542273,5,B009JUXFS6,I am in USA and watch many BBC programs. PBS introduced me to British programming and Netflix brought many of my favorite shows. There were some I just wanted to have in my own collection and was unable to until I found a mutli-region player. I love Murder Most Horrid and have longed to have it for years. I just love it. Dawn French is brilliant and makes me smile and laugh out loud!!!,1358467200,3,388,4.256756756756757
8542274,5,B009JUXFS6,At first I unsure about getting this dvd set based on the title. However seeing Dawn French was the lead actor in this series I went ahead and bought and I'm very glad I did. It shows a wide range of her acting ability. I loved it. It's too bad there were only 2 serird made (12 episodes) because I would have wanted to see more. If she ever has time that needs to be filled in...redoing this series would be something to see.,1357257600,3,426,4.083333333333333
