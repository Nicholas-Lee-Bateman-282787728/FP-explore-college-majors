5070180,5,B0079R1LNM,"This is a film I had desperately sought to own since last viewing it for the third time on broadcast television in 1975... and prior to that, had seen it twice in separate theaters. The movie stars Joseph Cotten as a bored banker with a quick get-rich scheme. Teresa Wright also co-stars as his unsuspecting wife in a tense-filled drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Joseph Cotten, who also narrates, calculates his plan so convincingly has always been a favorite of mine in these types of roles. Remember him in: ""Shadow Of A Doubt"", ""Walk Softly, Stranger"", ""The Money Trap"", etc.?  His feeling of abandonment in the French Quarters of New Orleans accompanied by the melancholy voice of the late singer, Helen Humes is an emotional heart-grabber. Longtime favorite, Dimitri Tiomkin's pulsating soundtrack also adds to the film's greatness. If you are a fan of the classic black and white film noir thriller, The Steel Trap belongs in your collection. 5 Stars all the way!",1372118400,8,1010,4.804597701149425
5070181,5,B0079R1LNM,Not often does one find a film that not only holds one's attention minute to minute (don't leave the film to answer the phone!) but at the same time clearly states a message regarding conscience (right and wrong).  Important in this age of situational ethics.,1353888000,10,259,4.7555555555555555
5070182,4,B0079R1LNM,"""The Steel Trap"" is a taut thriller with enough stomach-churning plot twists to satisfy most film noir enthusiasts.  Joseph Cotten is excellent as a bank manager who cooks up an embezzlement scheme (seemingly because it's just too much of an opportunity to resist), only to find that it involves clearing a few hurdles that he didn't anticipate.

""Steel Trap"" has deep roots in radio theater.  With the smooth-voiced radio veteran Cotten doing voice-overs, and a wonderful score by Dmitri Tiomkin, one could almost enjoy this production with the screen blank, and only the audio working.  But the cinematography is by the much renowned Ernest Lazlo, and the visuals are excellent, too.  Locales include Los Angeles, and some terrific scenes of New Orleans' streetscapes.  The camera follows Cotten and his wife (Theresa Wright) as they negotiate a trail of obstacles, with Cotten enjoying improbable luck and squirming his way through some tight squeezes, until fate crashes down... or, does it?

Clever and memorable.",1341792000,17,1018,5.246913580246914

If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it.",1494374400,,170,4.483870967741935
8512962,3,B0079R1LNM,"I love Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright and they both did a fabulous acting job in this movie. My husband, son and I who like to study film noir and its type weren't big fans of this one though. Cotten narrates the entire movie almost from a ""conscience"" speaking point of view. The music was terrific to move the plot along but Cotten himself kind of made you a nervous wreck by the end because his character was acting half crazy/anger management type off and on. It just wasn't believable or really that enjoyable. Disappointed also that we couldn't rent it and I had to buy it. So guess I own it now! Watch him in A Blueprint for Murder instead if you want a good suspense.",1490227200,,676,4.330708661417323
8512963,5,B0079R1LNM,"people try to poo poo the plot, saying there are certain points that shoul be different. movies will always have issues with the plot. that said, this movie is great and you get wrapped up in it from the get go. the idea of the everyman wanting a better life at the expense of the powers that be is a timeless idea. the ending is great, and it has some great dialogue and seeing him get all nervous is fun. old time new orleans is priceless and worth the movie alone. the wife is really sexy too, so that would be 2 great reasons",1487894400,,529,4.096153846153846

8512965,4,B0079R1LNM,"The thrill and nailbiting experience devoid of any CGIs is the sole property of vintage movies.  The Steel Trap in classic black and white keeps you guessing and you along the main characters are holding your breath as the plot thickens.  As a Joseph Cotton fan, I was vicariously involved with the main character's dilemma and his execution of his strangely benign plan which simmers, then boils and threatens to spill over.  Money and an evening very excitingly spent!",1475712000,,470,4.924050632911392
8512966,5,B0079R1LNM,"A real thriller! Best of this version with the drawing on the cover is a VERY clear print. Played on our UHD TV is almost Blue-Ray quality.
Movie review: Cotton works for a bank and gets the idea that he could successfully rob it. That is it...no spoilers from me.

Cotton is as usual great. Teresa Wright with blond hair really looks different from other films. She turns in a fine performance.",1464825600,2,395,4.486111111111111

8512968,5,B0079R1LNM,"We just finished watching the DVD and it was excellent.  I am usually a step (or two) ahead of most movie plots but, this one was different--I never knew what would happen next!.  This movie has the necessary elements of a good suspense movie: a good plot, many surprises, fact pace and convincing characters.",1421193600,,309,4.703703703703703
8512969,3,B0079R1LNM,"The average-Joe-turns-amateur-thief premise of Andrew Stone's 1952 indie 'The Steel Trap' might have had suspense potential within some plausible context, but Joseph Cotten's dopey assistant bank manager so naively conceives his million-dollar heist and subsequent getaway it's difficult not to laugh at the gauntlet of easily anticipated snags he encounters along the way to the film's ridiculous conclusion. That's not to say there's no entertainment value here-- his missteps remind one of Rex Harrison's would-be wife-murderer's in Preston Sturges' classic revenge farce 'Unfaithfully Yours' (Fox, 1948). Problem is, TST isn't intended to be a comedy. Where I think writer/director Stone goes wrong-- aside from not attempting to patch up holes in his logically porous plot (for starters, our nerve-jangled burglar spends much of the movie dashing about fleetly toting a cash-filled portmanteau weighing, we're told, 115 pounds) is in making Cotten's character so shortsighted and unsympathetic (e.g., he casually abandons his cherubic preschool-age daughter in Los Angeles while planning to flee the country with the child's mother by reasoning, 'Who's going to keep us from sending for her later?'), the viewer is more eager to see him get caught than not. Throw in Teresa Wright's painfully gullible wife/unwitting co-conspirator and tack on a sort of eleventh-hour-return-to-morality resolution, and you have, well, about 85 minutes of forehead-smacking silliness that, taken in the right spirit, can be fun for the whole larcenous family. 2 1/2 stars.",1415491200,2,1560,5.670940170940171
8512970,5,B0079R1LNM,"Having failed to get a copy of the movie which I had seen only once, many many years ago, I settled for the book.  It eclipsed the memory of the movie for me through the beautiful writing, atmospheric descriptions of times, places and people and subtleties in the characters that the finest actors would struggle to portray.
 Superb read.",1401148800,2,338,4.711864406779661
