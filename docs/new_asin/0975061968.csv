173960,5,0975061968,"Dr. Lam is the best instructor I have seen on dvd or otherwise. He is precise and complete in his instruction.  If you would like to learn tai chi sun style via dvd, Dr. Lam's  are the best available.",1354147200,17,200,4.102564102564102
173961,4,0975061968,The DVD is very thorough and easy to follow.  Dr. Lam goes through each movement step by stop.  There are also back & front demonstrations which are very easy to follow.,1353283200,10,169,4.419354838709677
173962,4,0975061968,"Most DVDs showing martial arts forms are poorly formulated for the viewer actually learning from the DVD.  All of Dr. Lam's DVDs have the same style that make them excellent for the learner.  Dr. Lam takes each move, breaks it down and works through it so you can learn the individual moves.  He uses a student to demonstrate the move and his corrections.  The DVDs also include warm up exercises and qigong exercises.  Dr. Lam is also concerned that students do the moves properly and not injure themselves.

It is always better to learn face to face with a teacher.  However Sun style is a rarely taught style especially in the US so a student may not have the opportunity to study with a teacher.  Study of other styles of Tai Chi, Bagua or other internal arts would benefit the student prior to learning Sun style.

That said, this is not a ""martial arts"" DVD.  Dr. Lam focuses exclusively on the health benefits and learning the moves.  There are no discussions or demonstrations of martial art applications.  Learn the form here, then use other sources for applications if that is of interest.",1353024000,26,1099,4.666666666666667
173963,5,0975061968,"Dr. Lam shows and explains each form in very slow motion, then demonstrates from the front view and rear view.  As a beginner, I'm still mastering the first few forms.  Easy to navigate to the form you want to review.  I will be using this item for years!",1348099200,,255,4.270833333333333
173964,5,0975061968,"The local YMCA in my area had begun to offer Tai Chi classes for beginners. Though I had taken some college classes years before, I was mostly lost on trying to follow the instructor and the other classmates, who seemed to be so much more coordinated than I. Buying this DVD helped me become more proficient and confident the more I practiced. Well worth the money..",1320537600,,366,4.5606060606060606
173965,5,0975061968,"Most of the time, I reccomend new Tai Chi students to a local teacher, but this is the only DVD that can stand alone to teach Sun style Tai Chi! Dr. Lam gives very detailed descriptions of each form, pointing out all the minor details. This is an amazing DVD for someone who has some Tai Chi experience and is looking into the Sun style! Once again, this is an unbelieveably good DVD!!",1314144000,10,385,4.287671232876712
173966,5,0975061968,"Dr. Lam is a world class teacher and practitioner of Tai Chi. All his videos are top quality and some of the best available, and this one is no different.",1272758400,6,154,4.166666666666667
173967,5,0975061968,"This is a wonderful, step-by-step resource for learning the Sun 73 form from Dr. Lam. He gives great detailed instruction for each movement in the form. The full demonstrations also provide great details for practitioners who are just brushing up on the techniques.",1260144000,6,265,5.186046511627907
173968,1,0975061968,"I am taking Tai Chi, Sun Style, when I bought this CD. I didn't recognize anything this guy was doing. I also showed the instructor some of the stances and she didn't recognize his style  either.",1481241600,,195,4.416666666666667
173969,5,0975061968,Excellent DVD. Dr. Lam gives very detailed instruction on how to perform the form as well as Chinese Health tips; a dvd you can learn from; excellent teacher,1481155200,,157,4.642857142857143
173970,5,0975061968,I'm enjoying practicing with this tape.,1467676800,,39,5.666666666666667
173971,4,0975061968,MOVED AT MUCH FASTER PACE. I LIKE THAT. THE OTHER DVD'S WERE TOO SLOW AND REPETITIVE,1454976000,,84,4.3125
173972,5,0975061968,Excellent,1444089600,,9,9.0
173973,5,0975061968,It is just what I was looking for.,1442793600,,34,3.375
173974,5,0975061968,Dr. Lam performs and teaches a longer Sun-style form.  Solid production value and excellent presentation.,1436140800,,105,6.0
173975,5,0975061968,Love the DVD but it arrived late with no warning that it would be late.,1434412800,,71,3.8
173976,5,0975061968,"Professionally done, easy to understand and to follow.
Well worth the investment.",1427328000,,81,5.833333333333333
173977,2,0975061968,"I have been studying Sun Style Tai Chi Chuan 73 Form for about a year and a half. I saw this video and thought it would make a nice addition to my Tai Chi Chuan resources. After viewing it, I an unable to determine what it is. It isn't Sun Style Tai Chi Chuan. The ""cloudy hands"" are done in the Yang Style, ""single whip' is done in the Yang Style and at times  is more like a variation of Sun Style. ""Repulse the monkey"" is closer to Sun Style than Yang Style but is not done in the traditional manner. A lot of the movements have the look of Chen Style Tai Chi Chuan or even Baqua Zhang. He moves very well and it is beautiful to watch.
I don't have enough of a background in martial arts to be able to figure out what this is, but it isn't Sun Style Tai Chi Chuan. You can view Sun Style Tai Chi on YouTube. Dr. Paul Lam has an excellent video of the Sun Style 73 Form there.",1420070400,4,878,3.905027932960894
173978,5,0975061968,As expected.,1418774400,,12,5.5
173979,5,0975061968,Dr. Lam is very good. I recommend his videos. Good quality.,1417910400,,59,4.454545454545454
173980,5,0975061968,Better than I expected.  It is actually intended to teach the form which makes this DVD a gem.  Though I have not seen the complete DVD I would recommend it to others.  Each move is broken down so you can pick up the small points.  The double view is also helpful.,1416355200,,264,4.117647058823529
173981,5,0975061968,This is the DVD I needed to learn Sun style.  Dr. Lam gives careful detailed instructions on the forms and uses different camera angles which helped me.  I also use his 24 Yang form so I am familiar with him.  Sun style is good for people with arthritis or balance problems.  I just started this form and needed to focus on specific moves.  Veterans of the form should learn something from it.  I find YouTube videos are too fast.,1408579200,9,430,4.379746835443038
173982,1,0975061968,"I bought the video twice from Amazon and had problems with both videos. I have many other videos from this instructor and have found them extremely useful and instructive. However, it is extremely frustrating to order the same video twice and have defects in the way it was playing.",1403395200,,282,4.775510204081633
173983,5,0975061968,Such a lot of information and clear instruction on how to follow the many moves necessary to achieve the correct balance with your feet and upper body working together.  I am enjoying the learning.  Regards Melva,1395100800,,212,4.861111111111111
173984,5,0975061968,"Mr. Lam provides excellent instruction that is easy to understand due to the way he breaks down each form.  I am very impressed with his teaching technique.  Since I have no background in Tai Chi, I was skeptical that I could learn, but due to the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I am pleasantly surprised and understand why Tai Chi is referred to as a moving meditation.  Once you learn the forms and can do them from memory, it becomes a way to reduce stresses from your day and become present in the moment--very calming.",1385769600,12,530,4.377551020408164
173985,5,0975061968,While studying the Sun Style 31 forms I wanted to work on the 73 forms. My teacher showed me all she could. I traveled to another teacher and picked up more but couldn't travel on a regular schedule. This DVD helped me answer questions and finish the forms.,1383091200,4,257,4.375
173986,5,0975061968,I am taking a Tai Chi class and this DVD helps and explains the different movements in the form. It's awesone Dr. Lam shares his knowledge with us all.,1381449600,5,151,4.241379310344827
173987,5,0975061968,"As Always, Dr. Lam has done a great job of teaching this form of Tai Chi. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is currently teaching Dr. Lam's Tai Chi for Arthritis programs and who wishes to learn the more of the Sun Style Tai Chi.",1378857600,6,237,4.0638297872340425

7794635,5,0975061968,"I am just a beginner, who learnt  the arthritis forms 1 and 2 by purely watching You Tube videos. Once  I was quite confident with the moves and started feeling the beneficial  effects of Tai chi, I bought this. Very informative, easy to understand from a beginner's point of view. Recommend to all would be Tai Chi for health beginners like me...",1490832000,,347,4.564516129032258
7794636,3,0975061968,"This would be good for really meticulous people who don't mind spending an hour (about 4 minutes each) to learn each and every move, but for me I just couldn't do it.  I was hoping for someone to slowly walk me through the moves not bore me with them.",1486771200,,251,4.122448979591836
7794637,5,0975061968,I am presently taking Tai Chi taught by an instructor who uses Paul Lam's method.  DVD clearly helps one to lear Dr. Lam's method.  Very good,1483833600,2,141,4.384615384615385
