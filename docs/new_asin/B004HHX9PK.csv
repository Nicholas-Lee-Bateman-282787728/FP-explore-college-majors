4375703,4,B004HHX9PK,McMillan & Wife Season 3 has always been one of my favorites. I particularly enjoy watching the episode where the team goes to Scotland for a family reunion only to get involved with the death of Mac's uncle. Has a lot of who-done-it intrigue. Any one who likes mystery will like all of the episodes in this third season of McMillan & Wife. Very entertaining.,1315180800,8,359,4.538461538461538
4375704,3,B004HHX9PK,"I love the MacMillan & Wife series.  However, both the season 3 and the season 2 DVDs don't play well.  On several episodes, the DVD stops and won't play.  Sometmes it will skip ahead and continue playing, but you miss alot.  Again - great series, but not sold on the quality of these DVDs.",1312675200,,290,4.314814814814815

4375706,5,B004HHX9PK,"As the title says, I really enjoy McMillan and Wife.  It is a huge treat to have another season out.  I can't wait for season 4.

Having said that there were some shows in season three that were real stinkers.  The first episode where there was a McMillan double was bad enough.  This season they have another episode about McMillan's double.  And it was even more foolish.  The episode with the Devil worshipers was a bit sickening.

Of course no series can be completely perfect.  As I said, I am looking forward to season 4.  The episode ""Night Train to LA"" is one of my favorites.",1301011200,7,584,4.4245283018867925
4375707,5,B004HHX9PK,"The third season of McMillan & Wife remains my favorite of this 1970's TV series. The episode ""Death of a Monster... Birth of a Legend"" takes place in Scotland. (Actually, it was filmed on a back lot at Universal. Rock Hudson hated traveling at this stage in his career.) The story unfolds in a scenic Scottish castle, owned by Mac's uncle. An ancient mystery is solved, and a new one comes in to play. Sally, Mildred, and Enright are along for the adventure which also features guest star Roddy McDowall. ""The Man Without a Face"" stars the lovely Dana Wynter, and also familiar character actors Nehemiah Persoff, Vito Scotti, and Steve Forrest. We get the background about Mac's secret service days. Espionage and secret identities fill this story. ""Reunion in Terror"" features Rosey Grier and Buddy Hackett. Plot revolves around a class reunion and old college friends of Mac. The following episodes complete Season Three of McMillan & Wife: ""The Devil, You Say"", ""Cross and Double Cross"" and ""Freefall to Terror"". Other guest stars include Rhonda Fleming, Barbara Feldon, Keenan Wynn, Tom Bosley, and Werner Klemperer.

Lots of fun in this DVD set. There are no extras. Picture and sound are crystal clear. The opening of each episode features the beautiful Henry Mancini NBC Mystery theme. Well worth a purchase for McMillan fans.",1299628800,48,1334,4.982062780269058
4375708,5,B004HHX9PK,"Rock Hudson found his feature film career basically over by the early 1970's. However, he was eventually cast in NBC's ""Mcmillan and Wife"", a mystery-themed telefilm that aired on a rotating basis with other made-for-TV movies like ""Columbo"" and ""McCloud"" on Sunday nights.

 ""Mcmillan and Wife"" was really the inspiration for the Stephanie Powers/Robert Wagner vehicle ""Hart to Hart"" years later.

 The 90 minute telefilms dealt with Hudson playing a San Francisco police commissioner who solved mystery's like deaths and kidnappings alongside his young and vibrant wife played to perfection by Susan Saint James. Hudson would later claim that he hated doing the series/films because he felt the writing was terrible and the plots asinine, but he did it for sole economic purposes. Up until the day he died he and Saint James remained the closest of friends.

 In season three there were six telefilms made and the following are a list of those episodes along with their airdates. Like previous box set releases there are no bonuses.

1. ""Death of a Monster...Birth of a Legend"", Sept. 30, 1973
2. ""The Devil, You Say"", Oct. 21, 1973
3. ""Free Fall to Terror"", Nov. 11, 1973
4. ""The Man Without A Face"", Jan. 6, 1974
5. ""Reunion in Terror"", Jan. 27, 1974
6. ""Cross and Double Cross"", Feb. 17, 1974",1299542400,34,1297,4.894977168949771

4375733,5,B004HHX9PK,McMillan and Wife is a great show from the 70's! I used to watch it every time it was on as the Sunday night mystery movie. I now have all 5 seasons of McMillan and Wife and I watch them over and over!,1398297600,,201,3.697674418604651
4375734,4,B004HHX9PK,"There is a warmth and charm between Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James that makes watching this couple thrilling.  John Schuck and Nancy Walker are both in season three adding to the fun.  The episodes run longer than I expected, an hour plus.  Episode 2 ""The devil you say"" was very spooky.  And taken a little too far, I would have preferred less detail.  Or, just leave out this one completely.  Cross and double cross,  was quite interesting as Rock Hudson played a double role.  He also tangos with Nancy Walker.  They made quite a dance duo.
I gave three stars due to episode two, the rest were delightfully intriguing.",1395187200,,624,4.6

4375741,4,B004HHX9PK,"An original component of NBC's Mystery Movie lineup, McMillan and Wife features Rock Hudson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Station-Zebra/dp/B008B4KVS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Station Zebra</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant/dp/B0007US7FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant</a>) as San Francisco Police Commissioner Stuart `Mac' McMillan, and Susan Saint James (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-And-Allie/dp/B003476UIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate And Allie</a>), as his wife Sally.  The third season (1973-74), finds the couple involved in six more cases, with a rather personal connection, with the help of their housekeeper Mildred (Nancy Walker), and police sergeant Charles Enright (John Schuck).  Mixing romance, mystery, humor, and action, McMillan And Wife offered something for both genders.

Things start nicely with ""Death of a Monster, Birth of a Legend"" (74 minutes), where the McMillan's, Mildred, and Enright, all journey to Scotland.  After Mac's uncle is found dead in the locked chamber of the ancestral McMillan castle, the future of the family estate is in doubt, until Mac discovers how an insidiously clever murder was perpetrated. (Rating: 4 stars)

Possibly influenced by the Manson killings, ""The Devil, You Say"" (73 minutes) features a group that worships Satan and murmurs ""blessed be"", because they believe that Sally is the reincarnation of an ancient goddess, who must be sacrificed to Satan on Halloween night.  Werner Klemperer, best known for playing Colonel Klink on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogan-s-Heroes/dp/B002L9N4O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogan's Heroes</a>, guest stars in what is unfortunately the low point of the season. (Rating: 2.5 stars)

""Free Fall To Terror"" (72 minutes) is another weak effort, where Mac's former law partner apparently commits suicide by jumping from an upper floor of an office building, however his body doesn't hit the ground until several hours later. (Rating: 3 stars)

Perhaps the most intriguing adventure, ""The Man Without A Face"" (98 minutes) is concerned with Mac's past activities while with military intelligence.  After an old friend is found murdered, the Commissioner questions his former comrades, while searching for a mysterious double agent.  It's a very complicated tale, and although it's not clearly stated, the implication is that McMillan fought in WWII. (Rating: 4.5 stars)

Mac's past comes up again in ""Reunion In Terror"" (74 minutes), as members of his college football team gather for their 20 year reunion.  Unfortunately, players on the team are being murdered.  Interestingly, if Mac was in college in the mid-1950's, he probably could not have been involved in WWII, as was implied in the preceding episode. (Rating: 3 stars)

The season closes with ""Cross & Double Cross"" (98 minutes), which revisits a theme used in an episode from Season Two, where McMillan was impersonated a criminal who looked just like him.  Rock Hudson appears in a dual role again, as after a staged jailbreak, an undercover McMillan, joins a gang attempting to smuggle a fortune in gold, in an elaborate scheme.  Even in 1975, the dual role ploy was overdone, yet here it is yet again. (Rating: 3 stars)

Story quality varies quite a bit, with some winners, and a few misfires.  Targeted at both men and women, the tone of McMillan was never as serious as Columbo (1968-78).  A character living a fantasy life, Stuart McMillan is man with a high opinion of himself, and the writers attempt to prop him up as a cool supercop, with a hot young wife.  More than just eye candy, Sally is a real contributor to the investigations.  If you like husband and wife detective teams, you will probably appreciate the chemistry that Hudson and Saint James have together on screen, although they reportedly did not get along too well in real life.

With some extraneous action scenes, the editing is sometimes a little choppy, and throughout most of the series, the audio is often poorly dubbed.  Fortunately, even when the material is slightly below par, the lively interplay between Saint James and Hudson, and an impressive list of guest stars, usually resulted in an interesting watch.  The DVD includes a disclaimer regarding the quality of the source material, and image quality while generally passable, is quite soft in certain places, and subtitles are not provided.  While not ideal, it is still nice that this classic series is available to fans.",1373673600,,4613,5.758468335787923

4375757,4,B004HHX9PK,"As a child I love McMillan and Wife, it was my favorite of the NBC Mystery Movie series.  This boxed set is strictly no frills.  The transfers are adequate but it's obvious they didn't go through great lengths to restore the movies as well as they could have.  There are no special or extra features.  It is pretty much the same as the other volumes in this series.

Season 3 of McMillan and Wife had some good and some bad stories.  Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James as well as Nancy Walker provide good performances of what, in some cases are poorly written scripts.  I think where the writers were trying to be overly funny they fail and it just comes across as being campy.  When the humor is subtle is when it works for me, a little goes a long way.  The best of the stories are Death of a Monster, The Man Without A Face and Reunion in Terror.  The other stories are a bit uneven and perpetuate stereotypes.  Although I enjoyed Hudson playing both McMillan  and his con-man double again in Cross & Double Cross they laid on the ""humor"" a bit too heavily for the story to be taken seriously.

These movies are good clean family fun however.  You don't have to worry about foul language and gore as we encounter in modern crime dramas.  If you grew up with this show, you really can go wrong in revisiting it again.  This was about half way through this series and it's a veritable showcase of 70s era actors and it's fun just to see the 70s styles and cars and hear the discoesque music.  I recommend it.",1358294400,5,1509,4.313167259786477
