There are fewer GWS left than tigers eventhough sharks have been around for few hundred million years but sadly they have met their match with the Chinese and Japanese just in last few decades not in millions of years.

Sharks do not have scales like fish instead their skin is made of very small teeth, one of the hardest skin in the sea for a fish. Sharks put out only 600 lb of pressure per square inch in comparison to 1,000 for a Doberman or 3,000 for a crocodile since their jaws are not fixed, it moves around. GWS have no eye lids instead they roll back their eyes for protection. GWS have the biggest liver, infact three livers and it covers majority of their belly. There is hardly any oil in other animals' liver but the liver of GWS is full of oil which helps GWS buoyancy and staying afloat on the oceans' water instead of sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Humans start off with cartilage when embryo but then changes to bone but sharks only have cartilage to make them light and flexible which is how they have become the largest fish in the sea as a 50 pound whale shark, a harmless filter feeder. Sharks can not digest bones so they vomit their stomach in order to empty the content of their stomach. Very educational and informative documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1413676800,,1534,4.517985611510792

Anyone interested in sharks, this is a documentary that you must have!",1392076800,3,246,4.590909090909091
8511852,5,B0077PBPZK,Fantastic! The team uses a great white shark captured in a net off the coast of South Africa to explore its anatomy. The team sidetracks into discussions about evolutionary connections as well as footage of great whites to then return to the main dissection. It is an excellent approach as we are all quite unlikely to ever see the internal anatomy of a Great White.  If you are at all interested in sharks you cannot help to be enchanted by this intriguing approach to learn more about them. Fascinating material! I have watched three other films in the series and they are all outstanding. Highly recommended!,1336262400,6,611,4.764150943396227
