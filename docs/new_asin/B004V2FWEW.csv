8442673,5,B004V2FWEW,"Rajiv (Rishi Kapoor) returns home from studying abroad and encounters and falls in love with a mysterious woman, Rajni (played by the incomparable beauty, Sridevi).  He finally persuades his mother (Sushma Seth) to agree to the marriage.  They don't know that Rajni is harboring a dreadful secret, until the sage Bhairon Nath (Amrish Puri) reveals it.

This horror-drama is surprisingly good.  The plot is riveting, with many unexpected twists.  The actors are polished and believable, with the snakes being impressively controlled. (Though I will confess to some concern over the welfare of said serpents.)  The costumes are good, with Sridevi's being extravagantly beautiful.  The makeup was convincing, as well, from death pallor to turquoise eyes.  The songs and choreography were, while not exceptional, solid.  Overall, this creepy movie is highly entertaining.

(Cast also includes Prem Chopra and Guddi Maruti.)

On a side note: If you have ophidiophobia, don't watch this movie! I am not terrified of them, just moderately afraid, and I had snakes dreams three nights in a row afterwards.",1523750400,,1097,5.356725146198831

Nothing more.

Sridevi ROCKS Rajni role, and not to forget Amrish Puri's unforgettable contribution to the ACT.",1502755200,,248,6.057142857142857

8442676,4,B004V2FWEW,"A beautiful film with excellent performances by Sridevi, the snakes, Amrish Puri, Rishi Kapoor and Sushma Seth. I adore Sridevi and she looks beautiful as ever. I am not a fan of her but whenever i watch this film or Himmatwala i just love her. The acting, the dances, the eyes, the costumes are just amazing.

I don't know if its a remake or whatever but i love the film. Rishi Kapoor looks gorgeous and acts well. Sushma i think played Rishi's mom in many films but her acting talent is shown as a mom in this one. The snakes act very well. When Sridevi dances shes like a goddess. She can dance and look beautiful at same time. Main teri dushman, dushman tu mera, i loved her in that song as well as all the other songs on her in the movie. Its a super hit film. If your a bollywood freak and don't mind watching old films of 1980s i think you should check it out. Sridevi fans can love her in this one. She is a dream of every women to be like her, look like her, dance like her. Sridevi dances to seduce her hubby but she is covered with clothes in that song when people today try to show more sex in seductive songs but cinema at its best to watch with family and at that time its a perfect one.",1305849600,2,1201,4.088983050847458
