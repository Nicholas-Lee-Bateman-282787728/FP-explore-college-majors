8409624,4,B003YLC9OW,"I will first start by saying that Friends and Heroes is the first big budget style Christian animated series that has been published. There are great animations from Nest and some lower quality animations from Focus On The Family, but this series definately brought it up a level for the quality and talent that went into it.

With that said, the series is interesting. The characters are likeable and all play a role in the series. The overall, plots are well written and teach a good lesson for young believers. I would love to see them make a new series for kids. Perhaps, about the Protestant Reformation? *nudge nudge*

Now to the cons, I feel that the episodes could be a little longer. They always leave you feeling like you didn't get enough time with the characters and plot. One issue I REALLY had was the use of the word ""Heaven"" in the episode on the last DVD case (disc 1). This, was clearly blasphemy for Jesus says neither to swear to Heaven (where God resides and HIS throne) and Earth (His Footstool). I felt that the language was kept clean up to this point, but left me feeling disappointed and sad afterward. I do my best to not watch inappropriate things. And I don't watch TV anymore due to so many inappropriate shows in this day and age. I certainly have to think long and hard about considering the third series pack. I think, the producers could of refrained from using that language (especially for a cartoon). For this reason, I must subtract one star.

I will still recommend this series to other believers and I hope the producers will bear well in mind, should they ever make future series to keep God's Word FIRST and FOREMOST in every aspect of their shows. God bless.",1328313600,11,1701,4.552287581699346
