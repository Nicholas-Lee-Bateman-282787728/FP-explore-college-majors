8466408,5,B005D7M8I2,Really makes you think about what matters in your life-- the living of the life. Very accessible and intelligible. Sometimes it seems like he is ego tripping a little bit while preaching -- but his message is good lol! :),1453852800,2,221,4.55
8466409,5,B005D7M8I2,Great perspective.,1446595200,2,18,8.5
8466410,5,B005D7M8I2,"Professor Rao gives an incredibly practical and grounding explanation of how to integrate life changing practices simply into one's current situation. To me it represents a simplification of universal laws that we all may know, but may find it difficult to translate into action - this will show you how to put them into practice. This film is a wonderful addition to build on anyone's mental, spiritual, or physical conditions.",1443052800,,428,5.128571428571429
8466411,5,B005D7M8I2,What a wonderfully simple presentation of how to initiate a paradigm shift in your own life. I would highly recommend it.,1443052800,,121,4.809523809523809

8466413,3,B005D7M8I2,I bought this video thinking I could play it in the car. I will only give the DVD 3 stars since it shows Srikumar Rao giving a lecture. There are lots of shots of the girls in the class but little motivational content. I find that his books are much more informative.,1429315200,,267,4.153846153846154
8466414,5,B005D7M8I2,"This is a well-structured personal development program that has been quite effective in helping to change my approach to life, particularly my interactions with people. It serves as a great starting point in making more permanent lifestyle changes.",1428883200,2,248,5.552631578947368
8466415,5,B005D7M8I2,"Dr. Rao presents a powerful toolbox of models and exercises in this DVD that dramatically changed my perspective on happiness, relationships, and spirituality.  Ive read several books by Wayne Dyer & Deepak Chopra and while I thought those were great works, I found the models and exercises in this DVD to be more practical & actionable.  I still enjoy rewatching the DVD to keep the concepts fresh and seem to pick up something new each time.",1416355200,4,443,4.815789473684211
8466416,3,B005D7M8I2,"If you are a person from the business world (who has not had the time or the urge to explore practices that reframe one's reality) and you are looking for some tips that may enrich your life (other than material stuff), this DVD would probably be a good start.

Content Generally Useful

P.S (If you are a seeker with some back ground in esoteric studies or have worked on yourself for some time (your familiar with Wayne Dwyer, Deepak Chopra, Louise Hay etc.) this DVD is probably not for you.)",1376956800,9,495,4.488888888888889
