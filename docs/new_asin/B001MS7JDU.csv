8321619,5,B001MS7JDU,"Every lover of Syd Mead, Blade Runner or Sci-Fi period will enjoy this. It gives some great insight into the man and his beautiful art.",1386720000,2,135,4.44
8321620,1,B001MS7JDU,"Its on youtube, so don't buy/rent it. Simply go and type the title and you'll find it pretty much anywhere else for free.",1373155200,,121,4.304347826086956
8321621,2,B001MS7JDU,"It's only eight minutes, and probably not worth purchasing unless necessary. I just needed some good quotes for a project over Mead's ideas and it proved sufficient enough.",1361836800,,172,5.178571428571429
8321622,1,B001MS7JDU,"I am doing research on Sci-Fi influence on industrial design and Syd Mead is one of my study subject.  I got a few of his books and they are alright.  But this DVD is out of whack.  8 minutes ??????  WHAT ????  I thought they have send me a wrong promo disc.  After reading some reviews ( a little too late now), I realize this IS the full content of the DVD.  I am returning this for sure ( if Amazon let me)",1300147200,,409,3.855421686746988
8321623,5,B001MS7JDU,"Syd Mead has long created the future I want to live in via his inspiring art and design images. Like many, I have fond memories of his work going back to my early childhood. Mr. Mead's design and artistic extrapolations have an uncanny authenticity few others can match and this video is a genuine treat for fans who want to see and hear what Syd thinks about the road ahead.

Technically this presentation is a finely made short piece. The color value, editing, sound, and composition are all top notch, making it a must have for any fan.

Whenever you need a creative boost, Syd's books, interviews and now his video interviews provide a wellspring of creative sustenance.",1262131200,,674,4.703389830508475
8321624,1,B001MS7JDU,"How the producers of this wretched effort have the nerve to charge anyone is a complete mystery. Not only is the content poorly done, half-baked and conceptually limited, by the time it starts to go anywhere, it's over. It's only 10 minutes long! It's got next to nothing to do with Blade Runner. It shows some nice art. There's nothing about 3D animation, 3D or much of anything else. What was I thinking? I should have sent it back after the first viewing but I just stuck away somewhere, which is where it sits today.",1258761600,2,520,4.484210526315789
8321625,4,B001MS7JDU,"If you have the ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" DVDs, ""2019: A Future Imagined"" is a short commentary by the visual futurist (who established the visual direction Ridley Scott went with) on that 1982 movie and the world we live in today. Its a short film, not a feature length production, but it provides an additional point of view that any fan of Blade Runner or Syd Mead would enjoy. And as such a fan I recommend.",1242259200,4,415,4.402597402597403
8321626,1,B001MS7JDU,"I'm a a huge fan of Syd Mead, and I've bought Visual Futurist and I love it.
When I saw this DVD I thought it had more new work to see, but I was really sad to see that this DVD was only like 10 min long, and after I bought it...
It's up two you but I don't think it is worthy...

Thanks",1232323200,9,287,3.484375
8321627,1,B001MS7JDU,"This is absolutely one of the worst items I've ever purchased.  I would give a value of $2.00.  The title should be something like ""8 Minute Rambling on Artist.""  The title might lead one to ""hope"" for some insight into what ""more"" this artist envisions rather than just comment on old stuff and show him drawing.  This was very disappointing and is the epitomy of ""leaving one hanging.""  The video is obviously a strict money generator rather than an opportunity to lead the viewer in dreaming and creating.",1232236800,3,508,4.7272727272727275
