1408300,5,B000059PEV,"Earlier in this very week, I had the privilege of attending the memorial service held in NYC at the Lyceum Theater for Lanford Wilson. Marshall Mason, Jeff Daniels and Swoosie Kurtz were among the many who paid tribute to this outstanding playwright. I left the experience so moved that I felt the need to reconnect with Wilson's work. I am so glad and grateful that I began with this sublime example of his artistry.

""Fifth of July"" certainly will have a very special significance to those of us who were young adults in the 70s. Yet, I think that what it has to say about love, facing adversity, family, growing up, and growing old will fall on receptive ears of sensitive hearts and souls for some time to come. Structurally, the work is a masterpiece. While taking place within a two day time frame, the pertinent histories of the relationships and characters are revealed as needed through the amazingly believable and agile dialogue.

I find it impossible to imagine a better cast than featured in this film performance, although I have been told by many how wonderful Christopher Reeve and William Hurt were on Broadway as well. It is a credit to Marshall Mason that he was able to mould these immensely talented actors into such a cohesive and convincing ensemble.

Jeff Daniels, to my mind, gets to play the most noble of the characters. He and Richard Thomas play Jed Jenkins and Kenneth Talley, long-time partners living in Talley's boyhood home. The depiction of this gay couple is so wonderfully Wilsonesque. They just happen to be gay. Period. Both Daniels and Thomas play their roles with ease and sensitivity. Throughout the play, one is continually convinced of the integrity and simplistic, devoted faithfulness of Jed's character. The tenderness of the scene on the porch, after Kenneth has fallen, quietly and ever so beautifully convinces the audience of the profundity of the love these two share. Daniels and Thomas are superb!

While all of the performances are great. To keep this short, I will only remark on Swoosie Kurtz. The role of Gwen is the most flamboyant (and probably most fun to play) of all the characters. Gwen comes from lots of money and is, at the time of the story's telling, an aging hippie. She continues to pop quaaludes and snort cocaine as her persona depends on them, but as the story unravels, we see that she is not nearly as dumb as she pretends to be or as her husband believes she is. This is a stunning performance from Kurtz.

I tend to be one of those folk who like to read a good book or see a good play or movie at least twice. This has been the case with this film, and it has made me want to buy and study the script. Great performance of a wondrous work!",1305936000,5,2717,4.616977225672878
1408301,5,B000059PEV,"""Fifth of July"" is one of my favorite films and a great film of a stage play.  As someone who lived through the Vietnam War and the 1970s, I found the characters very accurately drawn .  And, what a cast:  Richard Thomas, Jeff Daniels, Swoozie Kurtz, and a very young but talented Cynthia Nixon!!!  You are drawn into the characters and the play from the very beginning, and it never lags.",1209254400,3,389,4.436619718309859
1408302,4,B000059PEV,"Lanford Wilson is the modern day Chekhov, and while ""Fifth of July"" isn't the absolute best example of this, it comes pretty darned close. The only thing really out of place is William Hurt as Kenneth, here portrayed by Richard Thomas. Throw away all preconceptions of Thomas's from his most famous earlier work (involving a family drama), and you'll find yourself very satisfied with his performance, as he is able to play the typically reserved, held-back Wilson-esque character of Kenneth with greath verve and conviction. He seems to be having so much fun, always smiling and giggling, but you can see in Thomas's performance that there's deep emotional baggage stirring, and even though William Hurt would've been able to more thoroughly convey Kenneth's complex character, Thomas does a very good job and it doesn't affect the quality of the production at all. Just don't stare directly at that mole-thingie on his face!
Swoozie Kurtz won the Tony for best actress, and you can see why clear on screen. Gwyneth Landis is one of the great characters of stage. . . outrageous, yet not Roberto Begnini level crazy. It's very pathological (the good meaning) and motivated. You'll enjoy it very much.
The production also features great performances from Jeff Daniels as Judd, and looking back now, after all the comedies that he's become so well-known for, you'll realize that he's an even better dramatic actor (on Stage and Film). He and Thomas seem to have a good affinity. The rest of the cast, save Cynthia Nixon, is from the Broadway cast, and they're all excellent.
Speaking of Cynthia Nixon, even at such a young age, she gives a truly excellent performance as June Talley, the last of the Talleys. Her part really isn't a large one . . . she's a supporting character, but she fulfills much more than her supporting part offers, and her eyes are magnetic, if not hypnotic in their intensity. She's young and naive, yet still she possesses
a great sense of maturity, and her ending speech, about how she is the last of the Talley's, is great. If you're a fam of the Talley Trilogy, you'll very much like the little resonances here and there in ""Fifth of July.""
I don't think ""Fifth of July"" would be as enjoyable for younger people as opposed to older ones. The subject matter alone dictates that, so if you're reading this now, you're probably be just fine. If you lived during the turbulent Sixties, then this production will definately be of interest to you. If you're a fan of good drama, not matter the medium, you'll find a lot to enjoy in ""Fifth of July.""
If you're a fan of Lanford Wilson, and have seen or read ""Talley and Son,"" and ""Talley's Folly,"" the other two plays in the Talley Trilogy, then this is a no-brainer. We're very lucky that finally, Wilson's great works have begun to emerge into the video mass media. Now many more people can experience his magic.
Bravo!!!",1047945600,16,2893,4.753479125248509
1408303,4,B000059PEV,"I was lucky to see the original production on Broadway, with both Swoozie Kutz and Christopher Reeve (and again later with Richard Thomas.  Trust me, you'll forget ""Sisters"" ""Superman"" and ""The Waltons"" ever existed when you experience these tremendous talents literally oozing character out of their pores.  Reeve's performance was for the ages, and not represented here, but Lanford Wilson is a contemporary genius of playwriting, and ""A Fifth of July"" shows you why.  His staging  is precise without being too studied, and his language soars in accessible ways that any audience will appreciate.  With undercurrents of pathos and sublime sexuality, the play succeeds by burrowing under the audience's skin.  It's easy to imagine yourself with THIS particular family, in these particular circumstances, even if it IS the early 80's...the beginning of the ME decade.  Deep, powerful, funny and humane Wilson's landmark of a play still stands the test of time.  Enjoy it and love it!",1012694400,10,983,5.256410256410256
1408304,5,B000059PEV,"I first saw this film 20 years ago, on Showtime network. I was mesmerized and entranced. I understand this was originally a stage production, and it has been flawlessly adapted to film. The cast has real chemistry and the story is not predictable, which makes it that much more enjoyable.
This film is an excellent drama, sprinkled with just the right amount of laughs along the way. It is a wonderful character study and obviously long-overlooked, so I am glad to know a whole new audience will have an opportunity to discover it!",994550400,13,531,4.720430107526882
7933907,5,B000059PEV,"In some ways a groundbreaking play for its time, Fifth of July is part of the Talley Trilogy which follows members of a family through several generations. What makes Fifth of July noteworthy is its frank and accepting presentation of a gay male couple living among family members. Some characters are more quirky than others but all of them have their peccadilloes and dark sides. As a filmed play, it is limited to the house and grounds of the family home. By the end the characters, or at least most of them, have endeared themselves to the viewer, warts and all. Along with the talkiness, some may find this story a bit dated. However, with increased acceptance of same-sex couples, and sadly the number of wounded military veterans, some aspects of the story are still current.",1489449600,,782,4.757352941176471

7933911,5,B000059PEV,"I saw this on PBS years ago and never could find it again. More impressive now than it was then. If you like acting and explorations of the human condition and relationships, you'll love this. Great cast makes it even better.",1417219200,,225,4.512195121951219
7933912,5,B000059PEV,"Extraordinary for its time! These wonderful and prescient performances in the just-pre-AIDS era deserve promotion. Swoozie Kurtz was WONDERFUL in this role. Jeff Daniels's best acting, ever, was in this unappreciated made-for-PBS special. Richard Thomas (a/k/a John Boy Walton) was tender, soulful, and authentic.  Highly recommended!",1411344000,,334,6.260869565217392
7933913,5,B000059PEV,A great cast that handles the script well. Love to see them in action. Very moving. I have watched this several times,1376352000,,117,4.363636363636363
7933914,2,B000059PEV,"There are some good performances, but the script has not aged well. Very much of its time. Some of the dialogue is snappy, but it feels labored at times.",1371340800,,153,4.310344827586207
7933915,5,B000059PEV,"I saw this play -- one of my favorites ever -- twice during its stunning Broadway run, once with Chris Reeve, once with Richard Thomas. I loved it both times. My only reservation about this PBS presentation is that the show actually was recorded twice: once for Showtime, where Swoosie Kurtz's hilariously profane performance was allowed to cut loose without censorship, then this intelligently edited version to air on PBS. This is the latter and, while it is superb on its own terms, I am so sad that Kurtz's balls-out Broadway performance on Showtime apparently is no longer available from any legitimate source.",1340582400,3,615,4.980582524271845
7933916,4,B000059PEV,"I confess I never got to see either the Circle Rep or Broadway productions of this, but after everything I'd heard about them, it just seemed to me like a lot of the actors in this TV production were holding back.  It's as if a producer said, ""OK folks, you're not on stage, this is the small screen, and you really need to dial everything back or it will seem too ridiculously big,"" and they took that a bit too much to heart.  The only actors this didn't seem to affect were Daniels (whose character is understated to start with) and Thomas (who'd had a ton of TV experience before this and probably knew how far he could actually go).  But you can see how good everyone COULD be if given free rein.  And this is just a wonderful play.  Lanford Wilson goes from conversational to lyrical and back seamlessly.  You should still get this recording and bask in the rhythm of the dialog and the warmth of the story.",1314316800,,913,4.341176470588235
