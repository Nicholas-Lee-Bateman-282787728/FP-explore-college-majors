8596844,2,B00DRQEU2S,"I wanted to say ""For Veterans Only"" in the subject line but the words I settled on are more to the point.  I believe the last veteran passed a short time back anyway.
I wanted to say this because unless you are intimately familiar with the geography of the countries involved in the war you will be completely lost during the descriptions of the troop movements during the battles that are described.  There are some visual aids but they are limited and do not remain on the screen for long.  So, if you are interested in the ebb and flow of the battles then you will be very disappointed.
This was an extremely brutal conflict.  I wanted to get a sense of the horrors that these men and women experienced, at least as much as any documentary can do that for a viewer, but this did not do it for me.
Then there is the background music; it is extremely annoying and in some cases drowns out the commentary.
Lastly the 24 page booklet that comes with the video is an enigma since there would be no need for the information it contains if the documentary told the story.
In short, if you are looking for a ""collectable"" then you should leave this one on the table.",1390435200,6,1161,4.336405529953917
