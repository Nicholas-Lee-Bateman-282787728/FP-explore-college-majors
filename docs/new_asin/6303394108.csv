It is chock full of fantastic film clips of Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Fats Domino. Carl Perkins,  The Everly Brothers, and many other icons of early rock 'n roll.
Somebody should transfer this to DVD before it disappears forever.",1449014400,,352,4.966101694915254

Anyone who was there in the fifties will love this.

The original footage is staggering.",1319673600,,127,4.9523809523809526
7845989,4,6303394108,"This video is the second in a 10-video set documenting Rock `n' Roll in America.  It's very entertaining and informative.

The video focuses on the initial years of Rock n' roll, and particularly illustrates the division between the younger generation, who loved rock music, to the older generation who sometimes perceived rock as a bad influence.

Similar to the first video, Good Rockin' Tonight contains great interviews from great rock stars (Springsteen, Tom Petty, Don Everly, e.g.) as they talk about Elvis, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and others.  A great moment in GRT is Dick Clark's take on American Bandstand and the importance of the Twist.

This video seems to have slightly more focus than the first, and seems to stay on track better regarding its subject matter.  It still seams to meander around, however.  It would be nice to have a narrator leading the video in a certain direction.

Enjoy this video, especially if you like vintage rock.",1102377600,5,956,4.968553459119497
