8225432,3,B000WTVYY0,"If you are new to diabetes you may find some of the information here interesting and even surprising.  If you are well-educated about diabetes you probably won't learn anything new.  Unless you are in need of a refresher course or something, you can probably skip most of the informational content of this dvd.  The obvious advice is all here--maintain your glucose levels, eat well, exercise regularly, and you can live a long and happy life even with diabetes.

The advice regarding nutrition is nothing new, frankly, and focuses mostly on losing weight.  Shop around the perimeter of the store and avoid processed foods.  This is common sense but it is repeated so often that one can only assume it is not so common really.  Avoid processed foods.  Again, common sense.  These two pieces of advice are given ubiquitously.  Open any book on living a healthy lifestyle and you will see the same things said.  Cooking from scratch and eating well simply go hand-in-hand.

Where this dvd departs from the typical healthy lifestyle and weight-loss recommendations is that it includes meditation and yoga practices.

The meditation practice is good for someone unfamiliar with meditation.  Rodney Yee suggests a seated posture that is supported.  You'll need props (two yoga blocks, blankets, etc.) but if you already have a meditation practice you are enjoying then you might find this all a bit elementary.  It depends on where you are in your own meditation practice so if you have none now the one on the dvd is a good place to start.  The importance of meditation for the diabetic person (for everyone really) cannot be emphasized enough and while there are many ways of meditating--from centered prayer practices to mindful walking to journaling--it is something too easily neglected.

The yoga practice is a good one with a lot of modifications suggested.  Again, you will need props so have them handy.  Yee has his students use blankets, blocks, and a yoga strap.  I would recommend watching the practice before doing it.  I am not sure that one can easily follow along with the dvd because while Yee is instructing he is also providing his students with the necessary props.  In other words, before they lie back, he is folding a blanket for extra support.  Great if Yee is in your living room with you while you are doing the practice--not so great if you are home alone and trying to follow along with the dvd.  Just keep the remote handy and pause as necessary.

Some of the yoga practice he recommends is similar to the hip opening sequence on another of his dvds .  However, on this diabetes dvd he is leading the practice, not doing it, and it is always wonderful to see less than skinny people doing yoga.  The two people on the dvd are normal people, not super flexible and who go through the practice beautifully and with flawed form.  Watching Yee adjust a foot or remind his students where their hands should be in any given moment is like being in a yoga class and will support you in perfecting your own form as you follow along.

Ultimately, it really depends on where you are in your own life.  For the diabetic who is well-informed, who is choosing to eat healthy foods, and who is already exercising regularly, the information on this dvd may not be as inspiring as someone who is new to diabetes.  I'm not sorry I watched it but I'm glad I borrowed this dvd rather than buying it.",1275177600,10,3405,4.708967851099831
