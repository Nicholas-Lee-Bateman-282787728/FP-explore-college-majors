8714170,4,B00WTBDSRK,"The movie gets off to a rocky start, but when it picks up steam it's hilarious and awesome. The Countess's minions are funny in a very European way that Americans see too rarely in film. Also, Jack Hawkins!! Brilliant as a weirdo vigilante captain. An odd movie, slow in parts, awkward in others, but all in all very much worth the watch, esp. for film geeks.",1388707200,3,359,4.454545454545454
8714171,1,B00WTBDSRK,I found it hard to believe Arthur Conan Doyle had anything to do with this story. It was boring to the max.,1363737600,,107,3.909090909090909

8714173,5,B00WTBDSRK,"Jerzy Skolimowski directed this 1970 swashbuckling period piece about Napoleonic times is at times brilliant in its comedic delivery.  It stars Peter McEnery in perhaps the best role he has ever had as Gerard.  Eli Wallach as Napolean and Jack Hawkins and Claudia Cardinale are extraordinary, and the film is based on stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and the screenplay is a H.A.L. Craig with music by Riz Ortolani.  The set decoration and production designed by Bill Hutchinson with photography by Witold Sobocinski and costume design by Dario Cecchi are stunning with director Skolimowski making the most of an expensive production.  Produced by Henry E. Lester and Gene Gutowski.  Although most of the film is immensely entertaining, it does not quite gel as a superior film, but one would not go wrong in spending the time with it.  MGM/UA, Color by Deluxe, Panavision.",1348012800,7,870,5.048951048951049
8714174,5,B00WTBDSRK,A delightful film that I did not know existed until I found it on Amazon. I have read the book but now I have the film! Thank you!,1332288000,3,130,3.6785714285714284
