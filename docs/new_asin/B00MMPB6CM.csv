6589008,5,B00MMPB6CM,Such an awesome show. I'm so sad that it's over. Please bring it back. I need to know what happens next. Theo James is fantastic!!!!!,1414281600,,133,4.36
6589009,5,B00MMPB6CM,"I'm sorry now that I didn't watch this when it was on TV (probably conflicted with something else I had vested time in). But it kills me that there was no 2nd season. The first season ended on such a cliffhanger and each episode glimpsed 7 years into the future. I want to know the journey! Great cast, they delved into each character's background so you knew what and why they were who they are. It was more than just a cop show. And you certainly can't beat looking at Theo James!",1412726400,13,482,4.25
6589010,5,B00MMPB6CM,"This is another show that was cancelled before it's time despite it greatness.  I have no idea why CBS cancelled it but it deserved better treatment.  Not every new show can have ratings like CSI.  The cast was great and full of great actors from many other great shows, but I was very impressed with Theo James character.  He did a great job of portraying a generally good person who was willing to do questionable things to do the right thing, and if he got ahead in the process, it only justified the means.  His interactions with the other characters on the show is one of the best parts of the show.  He has a almost father son relationship with his partner played by Chi McBride, and a very antagonistic relationship with officer played by Kevin Alejandro, who may have been a good or bad guy but was always left in question.  In the middle between them was Alejandro's partner played by Bonnie Sommerville who was constantly stuck between them.  I wish this show had been given more of a  chance to have the story that was being developed more time to play out.  Overall very entertaining, an I am very glad that it is finally available since I could never find it on DVD or digital.",1410566400,27,1190,4.442396313364055

6589020,5,B00MMPB6CM,"This is one of those series that I wish I had discovered while it was being aired.  I just watched the entire season and was so impressed with the story and with the actors.  The cast was really wonderful and this really showcases what a talented actor Theo James is.  He did a fantastic job portraying the young Walter Clark as well as the older more experienced version, and I really loved the mentor relationship between Chi McBride's character, Detective Owen, and Detective Clark.  From the reviews, I knew it would end on a cliffhanger.  I really wish I could see more episodes and see how the story would continue, but even with it ending the way it did, it was very much worth watching.  I was looking for a good show to watch this summer and I'm so glad that I chose this one.",1437609600,,785,4.379310344827586

6589028,4,B00MMPB6CM,I bought the series and I was wondering if anyone else set hangs up on the next to the last episode...I don't know what happens because the video does not play the last 30 min of that episode....Love the rest of it though,1430784000,,221,4.162790697674419
6589029,5,B00MMPB6CM,I found out about this show and it was intriguing. I got the whole series and watched them all In less than two weeks. This show is absolutely amazing. I'm so bummed that they canceled it but it's still a great show. It's actually become one of my new favorites. It's captivating and Theo James is fantastic!!,1430697600,,309,4.43859649122807
6589030,5,B00MMPB6CM,"Fantastic, edge-of-your-seat storytelling. Just brilliant. I can't believe I didn't know this show was ever on the air and I wish there were more seasons.  The writing, acting, settings, all of it great, especially Theo James and Chi McBride; they're marvelous together. But all the actors are wonderful. This is one of the best American Detective shows I've ever seen. Truly. Very sad there is no more. Bravo to all.",1430611200,,417,4.957142857142857

If Great Britian had a brain, Theo James should be cast as the next James Bond.  He has that presence that would be long lasting.",1426809600,,279,4.054545454545455

6589040,5,B00MMPB6CM,"A most promising and different police drama was prematurely aborted by CBS due to declining ratings (translation: it didn't have a gazillion viewers and wasn't winning its timeslot). With an excellent cast comprising Theo James (Divergent, Underworld), Chi McBride (Boston Public), and Kevin Alejandro (True Blood) among others, an unfolding story told in ""future flashforwards"" and present time, followed the exploits of a young policeman who ultimately becomes the youngest city Police Commissioner. Produced by Berlanti and Wooton, two highly successful TV show creators, wasn't even enough to keep this show on the air. (CBS could learn a lesson from NBC which has kept various incarnations of Law and Order (save one) on TV regardless of their ratings.)  The interaction between McBride as the de facto veteran mentor and James as his novice student, suddenly elevated by chance circumstance, was classic. The conflict between James and Alejandro for future primacy in the dept. was also well done and credible. The show did so well initially in its trial timeslot (Tuesday at 10PM) that CBS decided to leave it there and moved Hawaii 50 to Friday instead (where GB was originally intended to be). In addition to glimpses of the future, we were also shown past events in the life of McBride which explained his current behavior and attitude. (Ironicallly, McBride is now on Hawaii 50.)

The characters were all highly 3-dimensional.  James, as the attractive, competent, and personable titular character was especially appealing. His relationship with his sister and his romantic involvement with the ex of a jealous attorney added more drama to his story and this show. There were even some humorous moments thanks to McBride who had his own story to tell. As the show built towards its season ending climax which also involved a few cliff hangers as well as a tease about the future state of particular characters, CBS suddenly pulled the plug. GB was only second in its timeslot thanks to the return of Body of Proof on ABC and that wasn't good enough for Les Moonves & Co. To add insult to injury, shortly afterwards ABC (which wasn't going to be outdone by CBS's stupidity) cancelled Body of Proof!

Despite the fact that this is the only season of Golden Boy that we will ever have, it is first rate and highly recommended.  The stories are varied, hold your attention, and give excellent insight into police matters and politics.  It would have made an excellent pairing with Blue Bloods if it had been continued and moved to Fridays just before BB. But TV programmers don't think of their viewers.  (Look at the recent cancellation of Dallas on TNT because the ratings dropped without Larry Hagman - big surprise - leaving its audience to wonder about the outcome of several cliffhangers.)",1421712000,10,2802,5.0
6589041,5,B00MMPB6CM,I love this show! Wish it had made it for many more seasons!!!,1421366400,,62,3.8461538461538463
6589052,5,B00MMPB6CM,"Ah...Theo James--be still my heart!!  He is impressive on this show.  I now have a collection of most of his work. He's great eye candy, but the show is great, too!  I love character-driven shows and this is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  I love the crackling dialogue, the realism, and especially the chemistry between Theo James and Chi McBride. It's just too good! They make an awesome pair--and their interactions with each other are priceless sometimes--so hilarious!

I also did not watch it while it was on air.  It's a shame that it got cancelled.  The cliffhanger at the end...so good!  However, in a way, I'm glad that there was no season two.  Otherwise Theo wouldn't have been Four.  Can't wait to see what other upcoming films Theo has in store for us :)",1421020800,7,779,4.5
6589053,5,B00MMPB6CM,"One of the best series I have ever watched.  Well written and the acting is outstanding. Chi McBride formally of Human Target and now appearing in Hawaii Five-O, by my estimation was at his best in Golden Boy. Theo James of Divergent plays the lead character and exhibits a much broader range of acting chops than in anything else he has appeared in past and present. From episode one till the final episode you will be on the edge of your seat craving more.",1420243200,,458,4.4523809523809526

6589057,5,B00MMPB6CM,Loved this show. Too bad CBS didn't give it a chance for a second season in a different time slot. Monday night 10pm is a guaranteed one and done season for CBS.,1418256000,2,161,4.0625
6589058,5,B00MMPB6CM,"What a pity!! Such a great & good show !! Great actors, great performances, interesting story.
Why  quality in television  never goes beyond season 1?
Spirit of the times? It is frustrating to get involved with the shows and then have them cancelled before they have a chance to catch on. Not the first, not the last, unfortunately.",1416096000,,332,4.706896551724138
6589059,5,B00MMPB6CM,"My favorite new show--no longer on the air! I never saw this show during the one season it was on, but I'm always looking for a TV 'gem' I might have missed that is now on DVD. I love cop shows, and I love Chi McBride so I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised and found a 'gem'. The story of the youngest NYC Police Commissioner talking to a reporter about the rise of his career in 'flash back'. The episodes are great, with action, corruption, intrigue and always Chi bringing the calm, veteran cop presence to Theo James who becomes the Commissioner 10 yrs later. Is it a bummer the show got cancelled and we don't see any loose ends 'tied up'? Ya, kinda. But what you 'get' is a nearly 10 hour cop show/movie with great characters you'll really enjoy and then its over. It 'ends' just like every other great show, so just enjoy it and don't go in expecting more, and you'll be totally satisfied like I was.",1415577600,3,916,4.300578034682081

8673026,5,B00MMPB6CM,"It sucks that this is it. There is no more...I really like everyone in the series because you've seen them in other Cop Dramas as background or lesser character. They finally get their time to shine, and well they do. I really like the time jumps especially since the ""Seven Years from Now"" is 2018/19 so... anyways take the time watch it and love it for what it is.
Does it have flaws? Of course, the ""opening"" looks like someone did it up in Microsoft Movie Maker and said, ""oh it will be fixed in post."" Every cliche is played out to a T, and the fact that most of the ""future"" look like someone put a blue filter over the camera leans to make it ""gritty"" can be a bit distracting.
The good in it though is that it has the Cop drama cliches and plays them like a well formed game of Chess. You have characters that are actually human and have lives that are all to close to home for some, despite the fact that most of them look like they came from a GQ magazine. There are issues such as addiction, adultery, and death that are hard pills for anyone to swallow just put out on display to show the form and shaping of the character and the world around them. I say it's worth the time to watch and just take it in.",1528675200,,1217,4.117647058823529
8673027,5,B00MMPB6CM,"A well done if a bit cliched police drama with a young, very ambitious New York homicide detective in a precinct of talented emotional screw ups. Walter Clark is an interesting character with a family history that's just as dysfunctional and dramatic as his professional career. It's too bad they never continued with this series. It had great writing and complex story lines.",1509580800,,376,4.984126984126984

8673035,5,B00MMPB6CM,This series is freaking awesome and I don't know why it was canceled:( they should totally bring it back or make a movie about what happens in those 7yrs- I never saw it advertised until it was canceled & that sucks cause I would've watched it all the time.
