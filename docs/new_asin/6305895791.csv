7897135,5,6305895791,The Balance Ball Fitness - Abs workout is my favorite of all of them.  After 4 kids I wanted to tone the abs to be totally flat and firm like I had before the kids.  I enjoy the work out as well as it is exciting when I see how the abs are getting stronger.,1311984000,,257,3.6545454545454548
7897136,5,6305895791,"Balance Ball Fitness Abs is a slow-moving yet tough workout which will really challenge your abdominal and core strength.  Prior to the start of the workout, instructor Suzanne Deason spends approximately 5 minutes providing basic instruction plus a few warm-up moves on the ball, including rolling the pelvis and hip areas plus draping yourself over the ball.  The workout begins with some basic twists and crunch movements both sitting and lying on top of the ball.  You then move to the floor on your back, placing the ball between your legs for a toe tap series both with and without arm movements; many of my Pilates videos include similar exercises.  Next come two additional Pilates moves:  rolling up from a lying position and doing a twist while in a seated stradle position.  In these exercises, the ball really helps to assist with correct placement and form.

You will then lie on top of the ball, face down, for a series of tough moves in a plank position.  Particularly difficult was forming a plank with only your toes on the ball and then rolling your knees in towards your chest--you will definitely feel this one!  Following this, Suzanne does a nice relaxing side twist, but you're not quite done:  the most challenging work is still to come.  In the final segment, you again return to lying on the floor on your back, this time placing the ball between your feet for some moves which concentrate on the lower abs area.  For the most difficult of these, you lift your hips, moving your legs overhead and setting the ball down on the floor behind you.  This looks like a yoga pose, the plow, but the exercise is actually dervived from the Pilates rollover, and it requires quite a bit of prerequiste core strength.  Suzanne ends the routine with a few minutes of nice back and side stretches over the ball for a total workout time of 26 minutes (not including the instruction/warm-up).

I felt that this video gave my abs a great workout, and I particularly liked the excellent lower body work towards the end.  I would classify this as an intermediate abs workout, and prior experience with intermediate Pilates moves would be extremely beneficial.  The setting for this workout is rather serene--an outdoor stream with soft guitar music in the background--and the pace is slow and steady, so it is not for those looking to break a sweat.  However, if you want to do some concentrated work on your abdominal area with an excellent instructor, I highly recommend this video.",1106352000,5,2492,4.769230769230769
7897137,5,6305895791,"I've been working out for some time and let me tell you that this video actually made me sore the next day.  There's one very advanced move that will take some time to master, however the rest is a really great workout.",1050019200,2,219,4.214285714285714
7897138,5,6305895791,"I thoroughly enjoy working through this tape. I've only been doing it for about 2 weeks, and I can already feel my progress.  After working out, I feel tall and my abs feel tight (a small feat after 3 kids).  The yoga mood is relaxing too.  I look forward to doing this one day, then a Zone tape the next.",1046822400,,305,4.05
7897139,4,6305895791,"This is a great abs workout and very relaxing.  The method involves lots of stretching and focusing on breathing.  Lots of different exercises are introduced.  Some are easy and some are more difficult.  My mom says that there's no way she'll ever be able to do the move where you lie on your back with the ball between your feet and then put your feet and the ball over your head, but she can do all the other moves.  Because there aren't many repetitions of each move, it doesn't seem like the workout is that hard, but I can definitely feel it later.  This is not one of those ab workouts that will make you sweat or cry in pain, but it is still very effective though a little slow and long at times. An added bonus is all the stretching and relaxing over the ball which makes this a great workout for after work.",1041638400,6,816,4.232258064516129
7897140,1,6305895791,i purchased a Living Fitness ball that came with a sample workout for the abs. It was reasonably tough so i decided to get the full video. BAD!the hardest part of the video was on the sample! complete waste this video is horribly easy. Don't get it!,1030147200,,249,4.319148936170213
7897141,4,6305895791,"This ab workout is amazing, but deceptively hard.  The workout is based on Pilates moves and I think someone who has not had experience with Pilates techniques and breathing may either have a hard time with getting the posturing right (and keeping it that way), and may be wasting their time if they don't have the proper Pilates basics down.  A lot of the ab work depends on using your abs to breathe, and this is explained well by the instructor.  One problem with the video is that some of the moves she does towards the end of the workout are very advanced Pilates moves-- impossible at a beginner or even intermediate level.  Some of these moves have to be built up to with other moves, but the instructor just has us doing them as if they were simple situps.  She does, however, aknowledge that we may have difficulties doing some of the moves, and offers alternate moves (eg. alternating leg and arm moves instead of doing them simultaneously).  If you have never done Pilates before, I suggest doing this video with someone who has, and can give you tips on posturing that the video does not provide.  All in all, however, this is a great video and a VERY hard ab workout.  I was definately feeling it the next day.",1018051200,15,1223,4.502262443438914
7897142,4,6305895791,"Most ab workout videos cause me a great deal of pain in my lower back due to an old injury.  This video is amazing!  Not only is the ball supportive but the video gives you variations for certain moves until you are stronger.  Susan Deason goes over the moves thoroughly but I suggest watching the video first, then participating in the moves.  If you are out of shape or overweight, this a great video to add to walking for exercise.",997228800,13,434,4.3875
