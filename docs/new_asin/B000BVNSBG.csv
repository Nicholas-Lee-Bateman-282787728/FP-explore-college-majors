8093354,5,B000BVNSBG,"A cute little family friendly film (Americans beware ...as long as the family isn't freaked out by a bit of brief family nudity and an occasional risque double entendre..) Told in narrative form by chubby ""Manny four eyes"" this a tender funny tale about a financially strapped but loving family trying to make a summer holiday with what they have made me chuckle from start to finish. A really sweet picture.",1416873600,,408,4.76056338028169
8093355,5,B000BVNSBG,"I saw this movie on TV and I thought it was hilarious! I searched for it on Amazon as soon as I finished watching it. US standards wouldn't consider this a family comedy since there's a short nude male frontal scene (which I thought was unnecessary), some (spanish) cursing, and other material possibly deemed inappropriate for children (like old age talks on *those* aged effected organs, etc.). All in all, I do consider this a family movie (or maybe something between teen movie and family film), but it all depends on individuals parenting methods. If you don't have kids to worry about, just get this movie. It's cute and funny.. you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1261699200,2,666,4.850877192982456
8093356,2,B000BVNSBG,Fun comedy from Spain.  It has some content that is not appropriate for children.,1259020800,,81,4.785714285714286
8093357,4,B000BVNSBG,"I agree with the previous review on the great humor and good qualities of this movie, but know that it is not really for children or teens because of some scenes in which the father and son characters are shown totally nude while going about their normal bedtime and bath activities.  I do recommend the book for everyone.  Students learning Spanish will find this book a highly interesting reading comprehension activity.",1244419200,3,422,4.929577464788732
8093358,5,B000BVNSBG,"I was traveling through Italy when I saw this movie. I was in my hotel room, suffering from a bad cold, and I watched this about three times in a row and it only got funnier. It's all about little Manolito and his summer vacation. You meet his crazy friends, his crazier family, and see all of the trouble that Manolito seems to find himself in. A lot of the humor is subtle (and some not-so-subtle), but overall, the movie is wonderful. So good, in fact, that the first thing I bought when I returned from Italy was this DVD! I highly recommend it!",1142294400,3,549,4.288461538461538
