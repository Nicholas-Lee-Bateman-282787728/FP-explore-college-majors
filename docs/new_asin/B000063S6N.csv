1691421,5,B000063S6N,I have nothing but praise for this video.  Our son who is 4 has Pervasive Developmental Disability just loves this video.  He was able to count to 10 before the video but only in some type of active game.  Now he goes around counting everything.  He is even recognizing the symbol for each number.  Pretty amazing for a boy who didn't speak more than 30 words or want to interact too much 6 months ago!!!  Keep in mind that this video series is meant to educate your child and it does it very well some things aren't meant to be entertaining even though this is to some degree.  Sometimes simple and direct is better.,1076284800,5,617,4.359649122807017
1691422,5,B000063S6N,"My 17 month old son just started to count one day in the car. He is now counting up to 12 and has grasped quantity also. We give full credit to these videos.
Under a year may be too young but don't wait until they are two. Your child may surprise you.",1069632000,4,251,3.8461538461538463
1691423,5,B000063S6N,"With this DVD my daughter has learned to count to 20...and I have impressed my friends with children the same age.  They are getting the DVD as well, and my Church is getting the whole Brainy Baby series for the Nursery.  When you see a young child with composure counting to 20 (she is barely 3) that is all the recommendations you need!",1053388800,5,338,4.349206349206349
1691424,5,B000063S6N,"This video has it all.  There is music and lessons in counting and some fun breaks and interludes in between.  The children add a delightful quality to the counting, and the voice overs talk a child exactly the way I do, as a Mom.  The music is quiet and soothing, and helps a child focus on the material.  I was happy to see that they count to twenty and don't just leave it at ten. My daughter walks away after watching and counts out loud.  I like that this is a 45-minute video as well.  I find other videos are shorter, have less educational content, and use high squeaky voices or loud noises far too often rather than just focus on having good material.  This is the ONE!",1044144000,7,678,4.25
1691425,5,B000063S6N,"This video is bright, engaging and upbeat. It drew my daughter in because children are happily doing things that all children love to do, play in the water, play on the playground, etc. The review of numbers 1-10 is quick and then we pause for a jumping around, danceable song and then it's on to the numbers 11-20. Never boring and I have found it is interesting to even older children!",1043971200,3,387,4.464788732394366

1691441,5,B000063S6N,"This is a gread dvd to play in the background at playtime, in the car, or durring quiet time. It has really helped mytoddler with counting.",1377734400,,139,4.384615384615385
1691442,4,B000063S6N,"From an adult perspective, this video seems like it would be very boring, but my daughter doesn't think so.  It is very repetitive, but she likes that.  I think the repetition is what is helping her learn to count.

We bought this video when she had just turned 2.  She has gone through a couple of phases with it.  First she was mainly interested in learning the names of the objects that are being counted.  Then she learned to say the numbers from 11-20 in order (she had already learned 1-10 before we bought this).  Now, at 2 years 4.5 months, she is learning the actual values of the numbers instead of just saying the words.

My only complaint is that it is a bit too long at 45 minutes.  My daughter's attention starts to wander around number 15, but she doesn't want me to turn it off because she likes the ending.

The price on amazon is a bit high (on the day that I am writing this).  We bought it at a local store for much less than today's price on amazon.  Prices on amazon change often, though, so hopefully it will be cheaper here in the future.",1326240000,,1062,4.255
1691443,2,B000063S6N,"I am not sure how should I rate this item. I was searching for a disc that teaches numbers and counting. This does the job very well. It's simple, straight forward, but super boring. Almost put me to sleep when I was watching it with my 19 month old toddler. You hear ONE, and see the number ""1"", and one object appear. This is repeated with different object 3-4 times. Then it goes to TWO. And you hear the count...One, Two....again with a different object, 3-4 times. By the time you get to 20, you have already heard ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE.......a hundred time.

There is no pause in between to ""wake up"" the sleepyhead with songs at all. I have to say it's boring. I wish the maker put some songs to entertain the viewer.",1325203200,,726,4.299270072992701
1691444,5,B000063S6N,My son loves this product because of it's vivid imagery as well as how it makes it easy for infants and toddlers to follow. My son is 2.2 and he knows his ABCs.,1304467200,,160,3.878787878787879
1691445,4,B000063S6N,"This is a good DVD.  My boys started watching it when they were 2 and loved it.  They like the Brainy Baby ABC DVD better, but this one still holds their attention and they do count better after watching it.",1277337600,,207,4.15
1691456,4,B000063S6N,"My 2 year old daughter loves this DVD. She watches it every day. She loves the colors, props, and songs they sing. It keeps her attention and she is actually counting to 10 now. I was a little afraid to try something other than Baby Einstein -- but this DVD is great. I plan on purchasing the ABC one next.",1205107200,,306,4.116666666666666
1691457,4,B000063S6N,"I like these videos a little better than Baby Einstein because they use more words, numbers, and more interactive people.  My child loved the Baby einstein DVDs too, but as she gets a little older (15 months now), she seems to enjoy these more.  They are a little more advanced than Baby Einstein DVDs, I think.",1196899200,,311,4.535714285714286
1691458,2,B000063S6N,I bought this for my 18 month-old daughter because she loves the Brainy Baby ABC video.  But this video is EXTREMELY repetitive!  It bored her so much that she lost interest by the time they reached number 7 on the first viewing.  She hasn't asked for it since.  Very disappointed.,1195862400,,281,4.56
1691459,5,B000063S6N,I am thrilled to have had such a product in my home. Both of our daughters are quietly counting their fingers and toes and yet they are a little too young to have grasped that much from the product display one is 9mths and the other is 2 years old. Thank you so much please avail this product to as many as can afford it at even cheaper rates. Thanks to the crew that put this together. Homeshooling gets easier with such a product.,1194048000,,432,4.154761904761905
1691460,5,B000063S6N,"My 2-year old loves this, and is always asking to ""Watch numbers!  Watch numbers!""  However he is pretty obsessed with visual symbols in general, so your mileage may vary.

After some initial filler which you will probably want to skip past, the program goes through the numbers from 1 to 20 in order.  For number n, the format is to display several collections of n objects on the screen and count them in various cute ways.  For example, 10 unlit candles will appear on the screen, and then these will be lit one by one, while a voice says ""one, two, three ...""  You get the idea.

After the number 5, there is a short break to review the numbers from 1 to 5 and to do a tiny bit of addition and subtraction.  After the number 10, there is a longer break including a music video of counting to 20 on one's fingers and toes.

I think that as the numbers get into the teens, the program starts to lose interest.  Counting 17 objects gets a bit tedious, and when they are scattered randomly on the screen it is sometimes hard to keep track of which ones you have already counted.  In any case, there is 20-30 minutes of good, possibly educational entertainment here.",1175558400,6,1165,4.372093023255814
1691461,3,B000063S6N,"I bought this for my daughter when she was a toddler. She liked it until about number 11 then would lose interest, even after several times watching. She loved the bloopers and would want me to play that section over and over. Good for entertaining a child for a brief period but I am not sure she really learned counting from watching this.",1167177600,4,341,4.428571428571429
1691462,5,B000063S6N,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday (and for my 26 month old to enjoy as well).  As you can imagine during the birthday party all the kids were running around, yelling, playing, etc..  Well, I popped this video in for some down time, and as soon as it started playing all the kids stopped what they were doing and became afixed to the TV.  My husband came out of the kitchen asking what was going on, why was it so quiet.  Since than, my kids have watched it several times and my son is now able to count to twenty! THANK YOU-THANK YOU-THANK YOU!!!",1117411200,5,559,4.245283018867925
1691463,4,B000063S6N,"Let me start by saying that I didn't know that many of the Brainy Baby (BB) videos were almost exact repeats (with a bit more animation and extra things added) as Baby's First Impressions (BFI) videos.  Had I known this I wouldn't have bought several of each.  BFI Numbers is ok, but I think BB 123's is better.  There is more computer animation and the graphics are better.  BB counts up to 20 whereas BFI really only goes to 10 (they do recite the numbers up to 20 one time).  There is no reason to have both.  BB has a more counting (BFI often shows 3 of something and just says ""3"", while BB shows 3 things and has more counting in order; ""1,2,3"".

For the number 3, BB says:

""Three""

""1,2,3.  3 cups.""

""1,2,3.  3 pompoms.""

""1,2,3.  3 cookies.""

a child then says, ""Three""

""1,2,3"" (this is said when 3 tops are spinning)

""3 apes"" (3 toy apes are shown)

""1,2,3.  3 white mice""

After about 5 numbers there is a review of about 3 numbers (I think they could have reviewed all of them maybe in a mixed up order).  They will say, ""how many candles do you see?"", ""can you count the boots?"", etc.

I was happy to see that BB kept my favorite part of BFI #'s and that was the jelly beans.  You'll see the screen covered in colorful jelly beans and numbers are drawn in the candy.

BB also adds a touch of addition and subtraction.  Example: ""How many blue frogs?  How many red frogs?  How many all together?""  ""Look.  Five jacks.  Let's take one away.  Now there are four.""

They have a counting song about counting on your fingers but, honestly, it's not the greatest song or singing voice.  At the beginning and the end of this video they have these square foam number puzzle pieces floating in a pool.  They are all attatched like a big checkerboard but some of the numbers (like some of the 5's) are upside down.  I really don't understand why they did that.  Because of these few negative things I can't give it 5 stars.  Please read more of my reviews.",1114560000,33,1961,4.288461538461538
1691464,5,B000063S6N,We LOVE this video and with three kids in the house someone is asking to watch it everyday! I don't mind because it is happy and makes you want to get up and dance. Within a week our kids were racing to get to see who could get to 20 first and that is great because other videos stop at 10. This concept has also laid the ground work for showing how higher numbers are 'put together'-How awesome is that?! Because 123's has been such a success we went out and got the ABC's video-thanks Brainy Baby!,1080777600,13,499,4.154639175257732
