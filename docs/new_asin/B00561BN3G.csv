4584248,3,B00561BN3G,"<strong>La Casa Muda</strong> (Gustavo Hernndez, 2010)

To put <em>La Casa Muda</em> into perspective in the contemporary movie scene, let me do a little math for you. The budget for Michael Bay's latest entry in the Transformers franchise was one hundred ninety-five million dollars, which breaks down to $20,700 and change per second. Hernndez' entire movie--filmed on a budget of just six thousand dollars--therefore cost less then <em>a third of a second</em> of Transformers 3. Do you need me to tell you that everything about <em>La Casa Muda</em> is better? And I say this as someone who really, really didn't like a few things about this movie. And yet it is more inventive, riskier, and a great deal more fun if you're a technical geek. Which may sound odd; after all, Michael Bay is currently the Hollywood grand-daddy of ""wow, special effects (that don't have a script to tie them together)!!!1!!one!!"". Trust me, though, Hernndez and his skeleton crew did their best with every last penny.

Loosely (VERY loosely) based on an incident in a small town in 1940s Uruguay, <em>La Casa Muda</em> opens with Laura (Florencia Colucci) and her father Wilson (Gustavo Alonso) walking up to, and then waiting on, the patio of a dilapidated country house for its owner, Nstor (Abel Tripaldi). Nstor, it seems, is moving away, and wants to sell his local properties, but this one needs ""tidied up"", as he puts it. He lets the two of them in, supplies them with blankets and water, and bids them a good night; they will start in the morning. Assuming, that is, they survive the night. First come a number of loud noises from outside, then the noises start on the upper floor, where the two of them have been cautioned not to go due to structural unsoundness. Laura, afraid, sends Wilson upstairs to check it out. Suffice to say, the noises get worse...

There are a great number of things to be praised about this movie, but standing head and shoulders over all of them is the work of DP Pedro Luque (<em>Leo's Room</em>). The film is supposed to be shot in one continuous take; I don't believe it is (and the nature of the film leaves Luque a lot of places where he could have added cuts, a la Hitchcock in <em>Rope</em>), but unless you're a connoisseur of the art of film editing, he does a fantastic job at rendering the illusion of the single take, which allows you to indulge yourself in a number of ""how in the world did they DO that?"" moments. As well, every angle in the movie is exceptionally well thought-out to maximize the tension. The shaky-cam delivery plus the camera staying with Laura for most of the movie is about as close to a first-person perspective as one can get, and Luque spent a lot of time here, one thinks, on shot composition. All those times the camera looks down at the floor or whatever? Those aren't coincidence, folks, and they <em>do their job</em>. Ninety percent of the scares in this movie, if not more, come from Luque's choices of camera angle.

Second is the soundtrack, provided by one Hernn Gonzlez (not, one assumes, the soccer player). I have no idea who this guy is, and this is the first movie he's ever worked on (or so IMDB tells me), but he's got the idea, and he's got it well. Excellent use of dissonance, and while one can't exactly call the cues in this movie subtle, they're at least not overdone. Like the cinematography, this is very much professional-level work that was probably produced for pennies. It doesn't get much better than that.

I could keep going about the many, many praiseworthy technical details here--the creative use of lighting, the unspeakably awesome set design, etc. etc. <em>ad nauseam</em>--but, unfortunately, I came to bury Caesar, etc. Sitting atop the pile of praiseworthiness that this movie painstakingly compiles are the two elephants in the living room, and both of them suck the life out of this movie. The first, and if you've read anything about the movie at all you are likely well aware of it, is the Big Plot Twist(TM), which is the single worst BPT since <em>Haute Tension</em> in 2005, and for much the same reason: the two parts of the movie (it's roughly the first two-thirds and the last third) cannot be reconciled with one another in any meaningful way. If only Oscar Estvez (working from a story by Hernndez and Gustavo Rojo) had sent a tenth the time thinking about the script as Luque spent thinking about camera angles, this might have been a much, much more solid movie than it is. The BPT is so bad it opens up plot holes that didn't exist previous! (Just as it did in <em>Haute Tension</em>, come to think of it.)

The second elephant is Florencia Colucci. Now I grant you, she had by far the most difficult job to be found here, given that well over forty minutes of it she's the only character, and the camera is riveted to her for well over sixty of the movie's eighty-six minutes. And there are a few shots that show she is more than capable of the subtlety required of facial expression and body language to have pulled this off. Be that as it may, she's not capable of sustaining it for eighty-six minutes. She spends a great deal of time sniffling and looking constipated rather than terrorized. It gets annoying after five minutes, give or take. She looks a whole lot like a younger Jennifer Aniston, which makes me wonder if that, rather than her acting ability, is the reason she was cast. Still, given a less demanding role, I think she'd be capable of doing a very good job with it.

And thus we come to the most confusing part of the review: the part where I tell you you really, really want to see this movie despite the horrendous ending and a lead performer who isn't really all that likable. (For the record: I saw it on the big screen and can't speak directly to this, but I've heard the DVD transfer is one of those ""everything's a lot darker"" jobs, and this is a dark movie to begin with, so you may want to try and catch it in the theater, if you're lucky enough to get the chance.) Because the little technical details are absolutely worth your time. It's way too early to tell, but Hernndez may have come up with a game-changer as big as <em>Blair Witch</em> here; this is rock-solid evidence that a very small team can make a polished, professional-looking movie for about the cost of a starter motorcycle, though one may have to temporarily relocate to Uruguay in order to pull it off. ** ",1317168000,4,6425,4.6248904469763366
4584249,4,B00561BN3G,"I don't write reviews often but wanted to share some thoughts on this one. I rented it from IFC VOD a while back and found the picture quality to be pretty great. Colors are fairly drab but the detail and depth of image were top notch. First off why anyone would watch a foreign film dubbed is beyond me. The only way to see this film o'natural with the subs, it's not a dialogue heavy film anyways. Second the meaning of the glimpses of the little girl are clearly understood by the end of the film. I gave this 4 stars because I was disappointed that the twist was too predictable too early in the film and I agree with the other review that the film start was awkward and slow. The movie paid off after it got past the first 20 minutes and really added a nice finishing touch in the last few minutes of footage that we see when the credits finish. It was not supremely scary but was very unique in some of the filming techniques used to create several of the scenes and certainly had it's creepy moments. I don't know why the U.S. is getting the shaft with this release on DVD and no Blu-ray like the UK but I'll be buying a copy regardless as this is a worthy film to own for any horror fan and certainly worth a rent. Just be sure you watch it with the Spanish audio track and stay tuned until the credits are done rolling.",1315267200,3,1328,4.171206225680934
4584250,1,B00561BN3G,"The DVD cover says ""Prepare to be Scared"" - I was and I was disappointed.

It's main selling point is that it was supposedly filmed all in one take. This is a good achievement in that it hasn't been done with this type of film before but it also meant that there was no real sense of time passing - having no pauses in the story made it so that you couldn't tell if five seconds had passed or five hours, so sometimes things felt very rushed and even out of place (e.g. when they first get to the house the go to sleep straight away, then the father was in a deep sleep within a minute or so - which is very unbelievable).

It is also supposed to be another ""found footage"" movie, in the same way Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project (amongst many others) are but Laura and her father are supposed to be alone, so who is filming this footage? And also - why bother with the shaky hand camcorder effect when there's no reason for it?

When the story is explained at the end it doesn't make any sense (I won't list spoilers here - watch it and you'll see what I mean). I kind of predicted what would be the outcome early on but thought it wasn't possible - then it was. Like I said, a lot of the story doesn't make sense at all.

What was the point of the little girl ghost who popped up from time to time? It didn't really add anything to the story really and felt like it was just added as an afterthought to sell this as a paranormal horror.

Last, but definitely not least, this film is so boring! Literally 90% of this film is spent with Laura very, very slowly shining her torch over every single item on every single shelf for no apparent reason. I honestly watched the middle 20 minutes in double speed and it was still painfully slow to watch.

I'd been looking forward to seeing this for months but now that I have seen it I wish I hadn't bothered. Such a boring film that didn't make any sense whatsoever by the end. I'd recommend steering well clear of this one.",1315267200,5,1983,4.191601049868766
4584281,5,B00561BN3G,"The Silent House (aka La Casa Muda) is an intense, (seemingly) simple story about a girl and her father hired by a friend of the family, to go out to a dilipidated, boarded-up house in the country and spend the weekend getting the place cleaned up and in reasonably good condition for sale.  Once there, they find themselves the victims of a terror within the house.

Filmed in one continuous shot (and for a grand total of six thousand dollars), the 'one continuous shot' angle serves as more than an interesting novely or a way to actually make a good movie on such a tight budget: it puts the happenings one hundred per cent in real time and narrows the entirety of the movie into a very tight, intense focus.  It's not a 'found-footage' movie (although it does share a lot of the atmosphere and characteristics of the best of that sub-genre), but the camera does stay on the girl and her immediate surroundings for at least 90% of the time, roaming away only for a few key moments.  In this way it remains very much a point-of-view film.

This is one that requires close attention and, preferably, multiple viewings.  Some very interesting things happened watching this movie.  On my first viewing, a lot of things that were going on, especially with the way the characters acted, didn't seem to be making much sense until the end when things started falling into place and I thought I had it pretty much figured out.  As the movie finishes, one is left not only shaken but wondering if they pieced things togther right and, as with other mindbenders like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Forest/dp/B000ARXG68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider Forest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shutter-Island/dp/B001GCUO5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shutter Island</a>, you're left wanting to watch it again.

On the second viewing is where it got weird.  Watching closely you may see that certain assumptions from the first watch don't really play out or make sense anymore.  Some of the explanations didn't seem to fit as much.  Here's the strangest part, and something I don't remember ever happeening to quite the same effect with any other movie: as logic breaks down more and more, the movie abruptly gets scarier and scarier.  It's like there's something the conscious mind isn't quite picking up on, but is freaking the hell out of the subconscious.  Not that it wasn't already disturbing and frightening, but this whole 'subconscious freak-out' thing really pushed it over the top.  I've talked to several people who've seen this who generally get different interpretations of things in here, both from me and from each other.  It's possible there simply is no 'tipping point' where everything clicks in and makes sense (like with The Sixth Sense) but there's definately something weird going on.

I do generally love 'open-to-interpretation' movies with ambiguous endings, but often times This Much ambiguosness might be overkill.  With The Silent House it jusy makes it tremendously creepy and haunting.  A great movie, and a great entry for Uruguay onto the international horror scene (they've done a couple of horror movies before, but I don't think any of them got much of a release outside their own backyard; I know I hhaven't managed to see them).

8459127,4,B00561BN3G,"This is the best film Ive seen from Uruguay.  Of course, its also the ONLY film Ive seen from Uruguay.

Its in the horror genre, though not the usual.  Yes, everyone mentions it was made on a budget of roughly 6,000 USD.  The other unique thing about it is that it was done in a single, unbroken take [Theres a little footage toward the end, during the credits, that was probably shot separately].  Yes, like Russian Ark, but unlike the latter it doesnt use a cast of hundreds of people for a full-length movie in one take.  There are basically 4 actors: Laura as the lead, her father, a friend of her father, and a young girl.

For the first half of the movie you wonder if much of anything is going to happen at all.  There is very little dialog, and as the film progresses [yes, it actually does progress] it seems increasingly unlikely that a real, normal girl would be reacting the way Laura does.  As in: this house seems to want to KILL PEOPLE and now Im alone in heremaybe I should LEAVE?  Naah...

The soundtrack is about the usual for horror films: full of discordances, rarely loud, but creating a background full of tension.

Short dialog at the beginning sets up the premise.  A man who has done well and moved to the city returns to a rural area, contacts an old friend and his daughter, and asks them if they can clean up this house and grounds in preparation for selling it.  First you see Laura and her father approaching and entering the house, and then the wealthy friend arrives and discusses the work.  The dad figures it will take maybe 3 days.  Its getting to be evening, so he settles down in a chair and falls asleep for the night, leaving Laura awake, restless, and hearing noises upstairs.  Then, gradually, the weirdness unfolds.  Since I mentioned the little girl, I could add that one gets the impression she may be haunting the house.

Its easy to criticize the film: too slow, too little action, hardly any dialog, barely makes sense, and so on.  But it managed to draw me in sufficiently to watch the whole thing in an evening [its just shy of 1.5 hours long].  Subtitling is available in English or Spanish; the actual dialog is in Spanish [when there is any].  There are no significant special features [what do you WANT for 6,000 after all?]

The actress playing Laura has quite a load on her shoulders: she has to never break character, even with the photographer breathing down her neck, or never very far away.  She also has to convey most of her thoughts and reactions without words.  She does an admirable job of it.  So does the cameraman; its amazing how closely the camera tracks her at timestimes when it really CANNOT be far away, such as following her around the turn of a corridor, or into or out of a car for exampleits surprising you never notice any of the equipment or any of the cameramans body [maybe somebody can spot something in a freeze-frame, if they look hard enough].

Since the whole thing is done in a single shot and does not make use of CG or similar tricks, you figure it cant really be particularly gorythe object is to create suspense, not gore.  And yes, it does manage to tell a story of sorts, which Ill not spoil beyond having indicated who you actually see in the film.  Interesting, if you have the patience.  I give it a B.",1435017600,,3298,4.439267886855241

8459130,2,B00561BN3G,"In a remote patch in rural Uruguay, a middle aged man and his young daughter are hired by a landlord to repair a decrepit house. As they stayed the night in the house, increasingly mysterious and disturbing things will happen. At the end (SPOILERS AHEAD), it is hinted that there was some sort of previous relationship between the daughter and the landlord, and this is supposed to be the surprise twist of the movie that explains everything that went on before. Unfortunately, what has happened is never fully explained and is the main reason this movie ends in a very unsatisfying note. Filmed in hand-held camera and with very long takes (whether all the film is one long take I can't say) this is done in a way that doesn't call too much attention to itself, and is thus less bothersome than in other movies. Promoted as an innovative horror film made with an almost zero budget, it is indeed reasonably well directed. The main problem lies in the very weak script. As a twenty minute student short it would be sort of OK, but as a commercially released almost one hour and a half movie it is far less compelling. Also, the sound is pretty poor, at many instances I couldn't pick up what the characters were saying, especially when they were whispering (if you see it with subtitles, I guess you won't have that problem).",1382745600,,1325,4.594936708860759

8459132,2,B00561BN3G,"After watching and really enjoying the American remake with Elisabeth Olsen, I figured I would check this one out to do a comparison. I can say with absolutely no resolve that the remake was infinitely better than the original.

By and large, the plot doesn't make a lick of sense whatsoever. The motive of the 'antagonist' is different from the remake, and the motive itself is extremely vague and I still can't wrap my head around what was supposed to be the 'driving force' of the killer.

There are also countless moments where you tilt your head to the side and say to yourself, ""huh?"" due to odd behavior exhibited by the central character, such as *SPOILERS* the opening sequence where the girl and her father trek through high grass and fences to reach the titular house, when you see just moments later that there is a paved road that the 3rd character drives up to on the opposite side of the building. Or just discovering her father bloody and unconscious and without missing a beat, for no discernable reason, spends the next lengthy amount of time meticulously searching and inspecting every nook and cranny on the floor for SOMETHING, as if the ordeal with her dad never happened. Why? Who knows.

The climax of the film? I don't really know. I CAN say that it did not involve any sort of sexual abuse of the central character in her childhood like in the remake. Other than that, I can't make sense of it. What little sense it DOES make doesn't make her the likeable 'anti-hero' that Elisabeth Olsen pulled off, but more of a psychotic/schizophrenic woman who has gone off her rails.

I watched it, then shelved it until my next yard sale. Save yourself the time.",1361750400,,1678,4.620805369127517
