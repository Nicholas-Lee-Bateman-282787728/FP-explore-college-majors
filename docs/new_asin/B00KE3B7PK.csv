6422827,5,B00KE3B7PK,The best Southern Rock band since Skynard. This band plays from the heart. None of the modern day fake stuff. You won't regret picking this one up.,1410825600,,147,4.481481481481482

6422831,3,B00KE3B7PK,"Blackberry Smoke is my favorite current band.  They have revived the Southern Rock genre in spectacular fashion.  I've seen them live several times, and they never fail to disappoint.  This band is even better live than in the studio, and the CD version of this release proves it. The CD version of the release is simply awesome - a perfect live recording featuring their best songs, exceptional sound quality, and a perfect performance.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the video release of ""Live in North Carolina"".  For whatever reason, they decided to mix in interview footage between songs, which I find incredibly annoying.  The interviews are cool, but they should be included as bonus content and not mixed in between songs so not to break up the flow of the live concert.  Very disappointed about how they've chopped up the live footage with the interview footage, as I would not have purchased the video release had I known this.  So many new live video releases are done this way, and it doesn't make any sense to me at all, as it ruins the concert experience in my opinion.

At least the CD release of Live in North Carolina is awesome (perfect, actually), and will be receiving a lot of play in my CD player and on my iPod.  If you like Southern Rock and don't own the audio version of this release, definitely pick it up.  You will not be disappointed.  If you don't mind all of the interview footage mixed between the songs, you'll probably also enjoy the video version of this recording.",1406160000,18,1511,4.639097744360902

6422865,5,B00KE3B7PK,"The best ROCK band from the US in over a decade. This is real rock n roll music like it's suppose to be played! This ain't just no southern rock
band as most people think or would say. They are rock, country, blues, classic rock and more. I've heard and read about them in Classic Rock
magazine from Europe which is the only real rock mag left to read since there are no real ones in the US! My brother who's a big southern rock
fan gave this DVD to me as the only bands that i like even come close were Foghat and Blackfoot and i was blown away. The songwriting and
playing is incredible and they just a good old rock band! and they paid their dues. Being a musician for 30 years and only having a brief time
where i was really doing something only to have it cut short i am glad to see someone who deserves it finally make it and with all the crappy
rock music out there this band deserves to be bigger. It's so great to find a band these days who sound like real music and are really talented.
I have watched this so many times and i can't wait to see them LIVE! coming here in October with Skynrd which not really a fan of anyway
but i'd like to see Rick Medlock from Blackfoot who blew all southern and hard rock bands to shame. This is a must have for rock fans.",1475193600,,1268,4.015810276679842

6422904,5,B00KE3B7PK,"I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the interviews between songs in the concert. My DVD has the option of selecting either the concert only or the film with interviews. This is a great DVD don't hesitate buying it, they are a great Southern Rock band and this is a great concert!",1422057600,9,309,4.344827586206897
6422905,3,B00KE3B7PK,"Charlie and the boys are awesome as usual, but the quality of this video is not good.  Some one else mentioned all the camera cuts, but for me the worst part is that Charlie's guitar is mixed so low that you can barely here him.  His solo's are so quiet, and all the other fills that he does that give Smoke's song so much character can mostly not be heard at all, especially when he's playing the LP junior. The sound engineer for this video needs to find another line of work.  I don't regret buying it cause I want to support the band, but I probably won't watch it again.  Georgia Theater dvd is MUCH better quality.",1421625600,4,620,4.228813559322034

6422909,2,B00KE3B7PK,"Hold your nose, because this is the worst Blackberry Smoke video out there. Way too many cuts. Way too many interruptions. Blackberry Smoke isn't like this in concert. They are much more fluid in concert. This DVD does them a disservice. Too many cuts. It's like Steve Harris has taken it over. Every five seconds (or less) the camera cuts. Get ready with your Dilantin because it never ends. Want to see Charlie Starr? Sorry. Want to see Paul Jackson? Sorry. Only for a few seconds each, then nada. The cuts are just too unbearable. Sorry. I'm 100% a Smoke fan, but I just cannot endorse this video. It sucks. Spend the bigger money and get the Georgia DVD. The audio from this concert is 100% wonderful! I have the CDs and can attest to that. The DVD? It ain't worth. It's nothing like Blackberry Smoke. Don't buy the DVD. Just get the CD. Get the Georgia DVD instead. It's the cuts that kill this. Yuck!",1416787200,4,906,4.463855421686747
