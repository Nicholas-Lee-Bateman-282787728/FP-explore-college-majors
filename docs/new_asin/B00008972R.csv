1829870,2,B00008972R,"Rebecca Miller's ""Personal Velocity"" is dull, drab and pretty much lifeless. It tells the story of three women who have little velocity, personal or otherwise. All three (Parker Posey, Kyra Sedgwick and Fairuzza Balk) are all without recourse, stuck in situations mostly of their own making and unwilling or unable to snap out of it and improve their lot.
Parker Posey as Greta a Cook Book editor, falls into a primo gig editing an up-an-coming fiction author and proceeds to mess it up making silly, unethical and un-professional choices. And Sedgwick as Delia, usually one to elicit sympathy, comes off as a pathetic slattern, undeserving of anything much more than pity. Balk as Paula rounds out this ungodly trio as a young woman bent on destruction who mostly succeeds.
I know that all of this is meant to be ""real"" and serve as a comment on Contemporary Woman but give me a break. We've all got it bad at some point in our lives but we also have it good a lot of the times. ""Personal Velocity"" ejects women back to the 1950's and beyond; a world in which women indeed had few choices but marriage and children and as such it not only demonizes Men, it degrades Women: those  it is trying to glorify.",1074384000,5,1205,4.604651162790698
1829871,5,B00008972R,"When the movie begins you feel a little dizzy. The camera shots (digital filming) are so close on the actors you feel somewhat suffocated and want to tell the cameraman ""move back a little"". This sort of filming takes time getting used to and until the end of the movie you feel you are inside the flesh and sweat of these people. The movie does no effort to give you good shots of its actors. You see the three heroines in very ""ugly"" moments with their make up running, etc. You are on top of them and in a way this ""harsh"" filming adds to your intimacy with the characters and the total immersing in the stories.
This is the story of three women, each one in a turning point in her life. I guess what the movie tries to show is this moment of revelation and understanding, where all pieces fall down in place. In fact, it sometimes reminded me of Raymond Carver harsh stories who deal with such brief moments in time. Here the story leads us to this personal discovery, after which nothing will be the same.
The first story is the story of Delia, a woman who used to have a personal feeling of that was when she was young, but this feeling was severely shattered through the years. Now, through a hard process of independence she gains this power again. Delia needs to remember she used to have strength. This is not the strength and power of love. Sadly, love weakened Delia. But now, in this stage of her life she needs her own power in order to survive. Since the movie ""Phenomena"" I have a soft spot in my heart for Kyra Sedgwick who was able to move me once again.
The second story is about Greta, a young ambitious editor. Greta has undergone a period where she rejected her father following his treatment of her mother. She used to be just like him when she was young but his actions caused her a sort of ""numbness period"" where she convinced herself that she could settle for a simple life with her loving, yet non ambitious husband. However, Greta' s true nature (""unfaithful"" nature) comes out. She understands she is just like her father, full of ambitions and needs. This revelation causes her a lot of grief.
The last story is about Paula who shifts roles during the movie. From being a runaway girl, who could not handle a terrible accident she was part of, she turns on all her mother emotions and is now willing to take the responsibilities in her life.
The movie is absorbing and endearing. All characters are beautifully played and give you many hours of reflection and thoughts.",1072828800,,2500,4.44880174291939
1829872,5,B00008972R,"Many of these reviews have given detailed descriptions of what the stories are about...so I won't delve more into that aspect. I want to add to that though the unifying feature to the three stories -- which is finding what is ""moving"" each of these characters forward.  It is admirable that the movie doesn't give the answers, just gives the human beings.  Of the three I found the last story -- Paula and the hitchhiker, to be the most moving, and redeeming.  The connection between Paula and the wounded character played by Lou Taylor Pucci is palable and heartbreaking -- conveyed by their eyes.  It is about feeling for another person -- and in the feeling Paula expresses (now emerging from her state of shock) she identifies with the hurt she sees in the boy.  She sees how vulnerable he is -- notices he is just like a little boy, just a baby -- and had been hurt, tortured really -- then she wants to take him home and protect him.  The boy can't trust that, however.  Both actors had  heartbreaking, expressive eyes -- and it is enlightening to see a film about love that is not about sex, but about caring and protecting another.",1061510400,2,1139,4.521951219512195
1829873,4,B00008972R,"Personal Velocity, written and directed by Rebecca Miller (and based on her book) tells three stories of women at crossroads in their lives. A film that is divided into separate stories must overcome certain challenges. Short stories, if they are good, can still leave the reader a little unsatisfied.  This may be even more true of short films, as even a two hour movie tends to have less depth than a book. It is also common for stories to be of unequal quality.  Personal Velocity, however, succeeds in creating three engaging half hours with some powerful performances. I found all three equally entertaining. The first character we meet is Delia (Kyra Sedgwick), a woman fleeing from an abusive husband with her three young children. While this is a familiar, movie-of-the-week situation, Sedgwick is completely believable as the hurt, angry and uncertain Delia as she attempts to make a new start. Parker Posey, a distinguished veteran of many independent films is the star of the second tale. She is Greta, an editor who unexpectedly finds success working with a famous novelist (who makes a pass at her). Greta is married to a man who is nice, intelligent but lacking in ambition and she finds herself wondering if he will fit in with her new future. There is a great contrast between the first two episodes. The first is set in the rural working class of upstate New York, the second among Manhattan's literary chic. The third tale changes pace once again. Paula (Fairuza Balk) is a woman who has just been traumatized by a tragic accident. Driving aimlessly, she picks up a young hitchhiker who turns out to be another victim of a violent event. Paula drives with the boy to her mother's house, which does not turn out to be much of a refuge. Both the first and last segment deal with rather depressing circumstances, but both leave us with the sense that the women have left the worst behind them and are ready to begin a new and better life; the same is true of the second story, though its overall tone is more upbeat. Personal Velocity is about just that; characters who overcome the unpredictable challenges of their surroundings by the force of their own wills. The film was shot digitally, which works well with its focused, microcosmic perspective.",1060732800,4,2266,4.792838874680307
1829874,4,B00008972R,"As so many films are told from the perspective of a male protagonist, it's refreshing to see a movie in which men are the secondary characters and we get to watch a woman deal with an ongoing conflict that is the narrative focus from beginning to end. ""Personal Velocity"" is actually three short films, but the effect is the same. Each of the central characters faces a complication that overturns her world and requires her to find a new way of living her life. Each of them is strong, comes across as three-dimensional, and makes us care what happens to them. Interestingly, male characters play a role in their transformation, but in ways that make these women even more self-reliant and resolved.
The opening story is a neatly crafted account of a working class woman who regains her independence after marriage to an abusive husband (the flashes of his violence are shocking and brutal). But it's not enough that she takes her children and escapes. She must regain her emotional independence as well, and she finds herself in a situation where she must free herself again; this time from the leeringly casual abuse of a younger man who enjoys taunting her with invitations to sex. When she is done with him, you see her finally achieve the personal power (velocity) she once had as a younger woman.
The stories of the other two women are likewise well crafted, each taking a journey that has parallels with the first but explores different narrative terrain. One is a more comic tale of a young educated woman who through luck and circumstance becomes a ""late bloomer"" and suddenly outgrows her cute, devoted husband (a fact checker for the New Yorker), as well as a jerky, condescending former classmate and an overbearingly successful father. (It's his observation that she's achieved her own ""personal velocity,"" and coming from the mouth of an unsympathetic character, the title of the film takes on a certain irony.)
The last story is (according to the director in her commentary) a quickly assembled piece that uses conventions of the road movie to tell the story of a young woman who ventures into what may become a romantic interlude with a young man who is suddenly killed by a passing car. The abrupt shift of the story sends her reeling, and she becomes involved with another male companion, a troubled and physically abused boy she picks up on the road. By the end of the story, her car stolen, she is able to find the direction she wants to take, and she sets off afoot, having discovered a self confidence that until now has eluded her.
The three sections of the film are clearly dramatized short stories, an effect that is reinforced by a narrator's voice-overs. There are mixed opinions about the use of this device in film, but it works here as a distancing technique that reinforces these as stories and not just visual slices of life. In the middle story especially, but in all of them, it intensifies the ironies of what we're seeing. The news reports of the pedestrian fatality in the early stories ironically weave them together with the final story, in which that fatality occurs. We're reminded that, for all the differences among them, these characters inhabit the same universe, though they are strangers to each other.
The digital filming and brisk editing give an edginess to the visuals. And the performances are fine. The commentaries on the DVD add a level of appreciation, as they often do for indie films made under severe constraints but with utter dedication. I recommend this film to anyone interested in movies about women's lives. It is sharp, intelligent, and emotionally engaging.",1058572800,2,3625,4.829581993569132
1829875,5,B00008972R,"This movie is the story of three woman, told in separate segments. Each of the characters has to some extent engaged in self-delusion as to who they really are as persons and each one finds herself in the midst of a major life crisis. As each character deals with their situation, they begin to find out who they really are as persons and to find a possible path to self liberation, happiness and fulfillment in their lives.
 Delia(Kyra Sedgwick), is an abused wife and mother, who finds personal liberation by finding the courage to finally leave her abusive husband, and then rediscovers her personal dignity and power through her sexuality.
 Greta(Parker Posey), is a wife and daughter, who has lost touch with herself, first by being caught in the middle in a struggle between her powerful, ambitious father and her weaker, more fragile mother for her love and affection, then later in an act of rebellion against her father, by ending up in a loving but passionless marriage in which she has suppressed all her own personal ambitions. An opportunity for success rekindles in her all her own passions and ambition, as she struggles to finally break free from the influence of her parents, to come to terms with her husband and marriage and to be who she really is as a person.
 Paula(Fairuza Balk) is a young woman, who finds herself pregnant and who after a terrible accident, in a state of shock starts out on a journey to try and escape and make sense of what is happening to her. An encounter with an abused runaway, helps her refocus on her own plight and discover her own ability to care about others besides her self.
 All the acting in the film is excellent, but Parker Posey as Greta really stands out.  This is the first film that makes use of Parker's ability as an actress to convey emotion and internal conflict, without dialog, simply by the expression on her beautiful face, and it is absolutely stunning to watch. She turns Greta, who could have been very unsympathetic, into a character that one can care about.
 The film looks and sounds beautiful on DVD. The DVD extras include a nice commentary by Rebecca Miller, and a wonderful conversation with Parker, Fairuza, Kyra and Rebecca about the characters and the making of the movie.
 This beautifully written, beautifully acted movie is very intelligent and  very complex. One that makes the viewer think deeply. Which in an age of  almost total shallowness in the majority of films (all flash, no thought!), a movie that stimulates thought is a true breath of fresh air.
 There are no tight, neatly wrapped up endings in this movie, you have no way of knowing if the characters have made the right choices in their lives. This makes it tough for audiences and critics to embrace this movie, but if you do look deeply at it, and think about it, you will come to appreciate and love it.",1052784000,11,2858,4.675298804780876
1829876,5,B00008972R,"Parker Posey, Kyra Sedwick, and Fairuza Balk all get umpteen stars from me for their great portrayals of women who have reached a point in life where they know something has got to change.
There are three women: Delia, Greta, and Paula.  Their lives are unraveling, and only they can make the choice as to what to do next and if it is the best thing to do.
I thought the first two stories were extremely depressing.  I honestly didn't know the tone to the entire movie. I tend to not want to know a lot about a movie I am going to watch because what would be the point to watching them?  It's like looking into someone else's life watching these stories.
My thoughts are this -- Kyra Sedwick's ""Delia"" is a blue jean wearing chick who has a past of being promiscuous and a present she wants to escape.
Parker Posey is ""Greta"", the woman bent on success and high on infidelity.  Some of her thoughts were laugh out loud funny.
Fairuza Balk is ""Paula"", young, pregnant, and freaked out by an accident that she sees happen to a man she has just met.  She runs away and picks up a young mysterious hitchhiker  This is the best story because it ends on an unbeat note.
The writing was good, and I liked the style of filmmaking Rebecca Miller has incorporated with her stories.
It still left me with a bitter taste. It is certainly not a feel good movie, but it is at times compelling.

This film is so much better then The Hours, which shares many of same themes and a similar structure to this film but Person Velocity isn't maudlin and manipulative like The Hours. Parker Posse is absolutely great as Greta, absolutely one of the best performances of the last year.

1829899,5,B00008972R,"Before watching this movie for the first time i wasn't sure what got me into thinking about watching it other than Fairuza Balk and Kira Sedwick. And after the first time i watched it i was feeling like a STILL hungry dog. The stories of those 3 different women are really short and will end pretty abruptly on the screen.

After watching it a second time with a friend though, no little flaw that i could find in this little movie can come to stain anything from the Writing and The Director's percpective, to the 3 outsanding actresses i watched performing. I've never been a fan of Parker Posey but this time in particular, she impressed me.

Personal Velocity may not be suitable for everyone or every mood. Maybe a little too moral of a movie when one actually stops to think about its message? But if you just feel like watching a really simple, effective story about the lives of 3 average women who seem to be entangled in situations that would force anyone to make use of a supernatural strenght to overcome the odds, this is a great pick.

1829902,4,B00008972R,"In Personal Velocity, we encounter three women: Delia, Greta, and Paula. Delia is a middle-of-the-pack woman who's recently left her abusive husband, relocated far from his violent subjugation, and found work as a waitress at a restaurant owned by a man who's seedy son eyes her over like another meal. Greta is a metropolitan wife who, despite living the life any woman would fancy, is finding herself discontented and on the verge of leaving her loving husband. Paula, who is featured in the third story, picks up a young male hitchhiker on a rainy day with good intentions but finds that the chance encounter was much more than a random occurrence, and that the divine might be behind the entire event.

This film is highly entertaining, and what's more, it gives us just enough to be satisfied without overrunning its plot into the ground. Right about the time we're ready to be done with one of the stories, a new tale flashes upon the screen and we're once again engaged in a new little ditty.

Final verdict: a very entertaining film about the lives of three women that while I cannot recommend to everyone, I do recommend to the independent film crowd out there who prefers character-driven stories with solid acting and strong plotlines.",1215302400,4,1246,4.817757009345795

One very erotic moment with Parker Posey having some ""me"" time and several quasi erotic moments with Kyra Sedgewick having some ""us"" times. Fairuza was great in her perma-goth role and had a really touching event to deal with. I'm a fan of all three women so this was a big win for me. The drama was rich across the board. I felt Kyra's despair, Posie's anxious discontent, and Fairuza being Fairuza. Three women up against it and coming out on top, more or less.

The main characters are portrayed in situations that may make us question their choices, past or present, but they aren't judged.

I agree with the other positive reviews.  It's an unusual film, real, insightful, absorbing, raw, sophisticated but not pretentious, compelling, thought provoking.  The film also looks unusual, incorporating some edgy photography, occasional freeze-frames and staccato editing of action and stills, but not so much as to become tedious or lose its freshness.

This is a rave review for an unusual movie.  One of the previous reviewers said that the more she thought about the movie, the more she liked it. I feel the same way.

This is the story of three women at pivotal points of their lives.  The three women are not linked except that the movie takes place at the same point in time for all of them.  One woman is escaping a domestic violence situation from a man she loves.  Another woman is very ambitious and sexual, trying to reconcile who she is with who she thinks she is supposed to be.  The third woman is dealing with trauma and what she has made of her life.  All three situations are thought-provoking and beautifully portrayed by the accomplished actresses in their roles.

I rented this movie, watched some of the Special Features, and then ordered it on Amazon.  I truly loved this movie.  I'm not sure how men might view this film; although some are reviewers, I have difficulty understanding how men might appreciate and empathize with the depth of this movie, which is exclusively from a female perspective.  I think that most women will enjoy not only the depth of exploration of women's life situations, feelings, and complexity.  I don't think that this film is appropriate in any way for children; I think children will find it dull and not understand its themes.  In addition, there are adult situations (including abuse, masturbation, and violence) that make it inappropriate for children; none of these are gratuitous, however, and all contribute to make this movie as powerful as it is.

This is a haunting and beautiful movie for thinking and feeling women, and for those men that can appreciate powerful filmmaking  even when it involves female themes.",1138838400,3,1730,4.75503355704698

1829917,2,B00008972R,"Rebecca Miller spins three tales of woman who decide to take their lives into their own hands. In brief vignettes featuring three contemporary actresses (Kyra Sedgwick, Parker Posey and Fairuza Balk) escaping situations of largely their own making. I have never been particularly impressed with Kyra Sedgwick, but I felt that her role and performance was the standout among the three here. As an abused woman who finally had enough abuse, she decides to leave and take the lessons she learned in dealing with her abusive life to move forward, and she is excellent as much as she is convincing.

Parker Posey plays an editor who is given a plum opportunity, which in the end will alienate her from her husband and most of the middle-class trappings she has come to detest in her own life (she has chosen this path in life it seems to combat her feelings against her family). Although I generally appreciate Posey's roles, this one did not seem particularly a stretch.

At first view this film doesn't seem to be anything very special or coherent, but taken at face value - a unique sort of character study - the viewer begins to appreciate its craft.  None of these stories was particularly profound, and I didn't care too much for the first segment, although I do think it was well executed.  But when you start getting into Posey's and Balk's acting style, you really get into the film and start rooting for these characters, whatever their goals may be.  The digital film medium enhances this film a lot, with wonderful close-ups and POV shots.  I barely even noticed the movement of the hand-held camera, which is the mark of true precision.  This film allowed its lead actresses to explore the depths of their talent, and they reached as far as they could to achieve it.  This film is a wonderful chance to see three popular actresses in some very different and heartfelt roles, and I'm glad I got the chance to see that.",1108252800,,981,4.5397727272727275
1829919,5,B00008972R,"This movie was moving, brilliantly filmed, consistent and thought provoking throughout. Each portrait is beautifully portrayed, each woman struggling with her own story, ghosts and baggage, fears and hopes, searching for a sense of her own power, all the while looking for something better... What will it take to seize the moment fearlessly?

Delia's story was heartbreaking: her roots, her history.  Gripping fear keeps her from utilizing those chances to be vulnerable (since vulnerability has failed her in the past),to break free and to choose those people who can truly help her. She chooses, instead, her old survival tools--a tough exterior, self-sufficiency, and sexual power--which, in the end, is what she knows best.

Watching Greta was disconcerting...I am still not sure if she is a woman moving towards her own truth (ambition and power) or away from it (family and the beautiful husband). Still, attempting to figure her out, and coming up with a different answer each time, reminds me to be non-judgmental and allow everyone his or her own path.

Paula comes full circle: a runaway once herself, befriended and ""adopted"" by the gentle Haitian, she has one foot out the door when she learns she is pregnant. A near death experience and she bolts, she picks up a boy, also running and covered with visible cuts and bruises that mirror her own inner ones. She responds with such tenderness and vulnerability and  forgives the boy for stealing her car...she has been transformed somehow by the experience, enough to feel the stirrings of life within her and taste joy.  Which home will she choose?

Life is filled with opportunities to do things differently.  My life has shown me that rigid formulas don't work in the long run. Every time that moment of transition calls us to take pause, we are offered, as our women were, a new opportunity to discern how we will respond.",1101686400,2,1887,4.968253968253968
1829920,5,B00008972R,"'Personal Velocity: Three Portraits' is a touching and beautiful film that manages to remain unsentimental. The three heroines are complex and believable, as are all characters in the film, though most others are given only a surface glance. The acting is so well done, though, that even minor characters almost betray their backrounds with no words.

Kyra Sedgwick plays Delia, a hard woman with a beautiful rear and a realistic attitude. Delia's story is a strong opening tale. Each story gives a brief boigraphy of its protagonist, and Delia's backstory is lightheartedly told. However, her past, and certainly her present, are heavy, and viewers see that her independence as a girl saves her in her adulthood. Sedgwick is viscerally real.

Parker Posey is Greta. Greta's episode works well as a middle installment. It is not as dramatic as Delia's, but it is, in some ways, more depressing. Greta is a cookbook editor whose main antagonist is herself. She is intelligent, financially comfortable, and ambitious. Greta realizes that the lattermost quality, along with her tendency to stray from her devout spouse, must be met and dealt with. Posey is an understated and sympathetic Greta.

The final episode features Fairuza Balk as a young, troubled woman with a compassionate heart. This is in some ways the strongest story, but I think that it is simply a solid conclusion. Paula (Balk) finds herself wandering in her car after witnessing a devastating car accident, the only aspect that connects the three portraits. Paula's story is at the same time the most grim and the most upbeat. She ends up being the kindest of the three characters, perhaps only because of her experiences.

Families are prominently featured in this movie. As stated above, every part is well acted, from Delia's high school friend to the detached hitchhiker that Paula picks up. An artistic device used beginning in the opening shots involves freezing the frame like a snapshot. In this film, it is affective, and is not a gimmick.

The three portraits are subtly connected, and there is no blatant summation. I found many of the choices made, including using a male voiced narration instead of a female voice-over, interesting and appropriate. This movie is recommended, but do not expect a certain kind of movie: let it surprise you.",1101427200,3,2318,5.04177545691906
1829921,4,B00008972R,"Personal Velocity is the story of three different women who collide with a life crisis at different times in their lives.  Delia (Kyra Sedgwick) has frequently been abused by the man she loves, a love that has tied her down and made her incapable of escaping, but now she realizes that it is time for a change.  Greta (Parker Posey) is mourning the death of her mother as she has settled down due to her parents divorce that is the origin for her hate for infidelity.  On the exterior she displays a person who is content with what life has to offer her; however, when a big time author asks her to be his editor, she has a chance to get back to where she once was, on the top of the world.  The question is whether she can take steps to remove the ties that hold her down.  Paula (Fairuza Balk) has recently witnessed a traumatic death and found out that she is pregnant with a child.  Confused, she begins to drive home to see her mother as she is desperate for some guidance or a sign.  On the way she sees a hitch hiker, a teenager, that she interprets as a sign so she picks him up.  The three women are reaching their life decisions at different velocities in their lives.  Their  personal velocities are clearly represented as one has children, one does not even think of having any, and the third has one on the way.  This makes the story unique in regards to women and their choices, which often are influenced by external factors.  In the end, Miller provides an intelligent and excellent cinematic experience.",1081296000,3,1520,4.408602150537634
