617925,5,6303265715,"A masterpiece of comedy. ""Carry on"" style with a female lead. The whole movie is full of hearty ""one liners"" and great non-pc scenerios...dont watch it if your running for congress.
Cassandra Peterson is still unequalised as a female comedian...since 1989! Give the marvel BS a rest and have a real laugh! Terrific",1517961600,,314,4.943396226415095
617926,5,6303265715,"""Elvira: Mistress of the Dark"" follows our titular TV-hostess as she travels to Fallwell, Massachusetts in order to claim her inheritance from her great-aunt in the hopes of using the money to open a show in Las Vegas. The story itself largely follows that of other 1980s films, like ""Footloose,"" in which someone has to shake up a stodgy, conservative town. Throw in a touch of magic and some great comedy and the film is a delight. Cassandra Peterson is charming and funny as Elvira while Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah is a great antagonist. W. Morgan Sheppard as Great-Uncle Vincent Talbot recalls some of the fun and memorable low-budget villains of this era of horror film. To top it all off, the film includes various sight gags, like a theater marquee appearing to show a naughty message. Additionally, Chastity Pariah's name is a laugh every time it comes up. Even the name of the conservative town recalls Jerry Fallwell and his moralizing. The film further displays a level of self-awareness and is willing to make fun of itself and the B-movie genre while showing why so many enjoy it. If you want a fun, cheesy movie, this is the flick for you!",1516147200,,1158,4.70935960591133

618267,3,6303265715,I didn't know that much about the character of Elvira.  She shows up every year at Halloween in beer commercials.  But wearing that wig and that dress how can you not love her.  In this she flaunts what she has.  Makes some really bad jokes.  And everybody either thinks she's really funny or really offensive.  I was surprised how really hot and sexy in a stripper sort of way she is.  This movie is certainly not for kids.,1489017600,,424,4.358974358974359

Cassandra Peterson is perfect as Elvira; sexy, snarky, yet totally relateable and fun, and the supporting cast is perfectly made up of many familiar faces as well.  As 80's movies go, it fills it's quota of cheesiness and kitsch, but the story is well written and has no problem keeping your attention. By far the best part of the movie is the community picnic. I won't give away too much- let's just say love potion casserole + uptight conservative adults = hilarity ensuing! Definitely add this one to your collection!",1478563200,,658,4.576271186440678

618561,4,6303265715,"Every year or two I remember that this movie if funny, silly and quite a bit different than just about anything else out there. If you are looking for a silly comedy that incorporates casual witchcraft, really bad puns and double entendre, the 1980s and boobs, then you should see this movie. This movie has a pretty familiar plot: Elvira (the outcast weirdo) needs a fresh start, so she moves to a sleepy little boring town where she shakes things up, much to the dismay of the local squares. No, I didn't write ""SPOILERS."" If you consider that a spoiler, then you sure haven't seen any 80s comedies before, because that's just about all of them. What makes this movie different and charming is Elvira herself. She is corny, overdone and more than a little bit inappropriate. Her two favorite co-stars are worth the cost of the DVD all by themselves.

I paid about $6 and received a single DVD in a case. It is a real produced disc (not a DVD-R) and the presentation is nice, but no -frills. I watched the movie and I was pleased with the quality of the audio and video. It wasn't really impressive, but for a cheap movie that was shot almost 30 years ago on FILM (whatever that is), or possibly on video tape (that was a thing, right?). . . it was good enough.

If you are easily offended by comedic depictions of witchcraft, really blatant sexual references and (probably) some mild bad language. . . stay away. Personally, I find everything in the movie to be too cutesy to be offensive, but I wouldn't let anyone under 14 or so see this movie. Parents should check it out before letting kids anywhere near it.",1476921600,4,1614,4.48639455782313

618655,5,6303265715,"I've loved the Mistress of the Dark since I was young. Beautiful, funny, sexy and a bosom to die for, she is the complete package. Elvira is one of those TV personalities that you really don't see anymore. So many of today's ""talent"" is here today, forgotten tomorrow. Disposable acts that few will remember. And they don't hold that type of ""star power"" that you saw in actors/artists back in the day. To this day, Elvira is still, if not more relevant to this newest generation even though her show and last movie was about 30 years ago.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan, or if you grew up in the 80's and was around to see the rise of this American icon. The movie does show it's age, but not as bad as you would think. It still holds up well today and the comedy is classic.",1475971200,,792,4.2105263157894735
618656,5,6303265715,"Well, I didn't buy this on Amazon, but I have the DVD and it is one of my favorite cult classics of all time. Debating on getting it online as I love the convenience of not having to have a DVD or Blu-Ray player to play my disc. Yea, the acting isn't the best but it is not bad by any means. It's supposed to be cheesy acting in most of these cult classics anyway. Elvira is funny and the story is cheesy funny and it's just a movie that you can spend time watching when you're feeling down or up or with a friend. Not a chick flick by any means.",1475798400,,546,3.8839285714285716

Now some don't like how she is dressed so parents you will want to check this out first, but over all in our family it's a great family movie that we watch at least once a year.  We laugh and thoroughly enjoy it. Buying it on amazon was very easy as is finding it when I want to watch it agian which is wonderful.

618980,4,6303265715,"Released in 1988, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark stars Cassandra Peterson as the zany title character who moves from Hollywood to Falwell, Massachusetts, where she inherits an old, creepy mansion. Elvira is a hit with the youths in town and makes a couple friends, but the majority find her offensive and want her out. Meanwhile her uncle is obsessed with getting a recipe book from the mansion for some diabolical purpose.

Cassandra was 36 during filming and looks great throughout (as do her stunt doubles). Ellen Dunning (Robin) gets an honorable mention on the female front. While only half the humor works (the other half being groan-inducing) there are several laugh-out-loud sequences, like the parodying of The Price Is Right and Flashdance.

Christians might find the portrayal of the intolerant townsfolk offensive, but (1.) the movies a comedy/parody, not a depiction of real-life; anyone who takes this seriously needs to visit the psych ward; (2.) the movie amusingly denounces counterfeit religiosity, i.e. sterile legalism, and not Christendom itself; and (3.) the ending pretty much makes up for the negative portrayal.

What I find somewhat annoying is the continual wisecracking that pegs Elvira as a loose woman, to put it nicely. While her long black dress reveals mega-cleavage and the upper part of one leg, its not exactly prostitute attire; plus the story shows Elvira interested in only ONE guy, which hardly constitutes a loose woman.

BOTTOM LINE: This is a worthwhile turn-off-your-brain-and-have-a-good-time flick with Elvira. Fans of cartoony horror comedies like 2006 Monster Night and Scooby Doo should appreciate it.

The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Hollywood/Burbank/Los Angeles.

618983,5,6303265715,"We all need more unpleasant dreams to appreciate Elvira & her little dog, the societal aspects of first impressions have no effect upon Elvira, (an important lesson for those to whom a little of religious behaviour is best seen & unheard of). A quirkier female who has no peer in the double entendre is yet to establish their presence in any place Elvira calls home.(Sigh).... If only the follow up movie by Cassandra et al was in the same calibre. Alas to be a one hit wonder with a smack that stings aint bad for a movie of schlock horror with mayhem amok.

When ELVIRA arrives in Falwell, she becomes the target of the sanctimonious, while attracting the more open-minded to her ""wicked ways"". Self-righteousness is dismantled by ELVIRA's infectious charms (only some of which are physical), and unabashed freedom. Yes, she is extremely hot. Yet, she also carries the story w/ her humour and her character's perfect melding of Morticia Addams, Vampira, and the stereotypical Valley Girl.

The buxom beauty is left to defend herself against the puritanical citizens of Fallwell, Massachusettes, and the her conniving uncle, who will stop at nothing to retrieve his sister's ancient book of spells! ELVIRA is busting at the seems with the same bad puns and tasteless humor that made Movie Macabre such a smash sensation in the 80s! Cassandra Peterson single-handedly sells the act as the always ditsy (but never dull) Elvira, whose quick wit is only exceeded by her stunning good looks. The Queen of Camp faces off against Edie McClurg as the prissy Chastity Pariah and William Morgan Sheppard as the delightfully devious Vincent Talbot. When it comes to double entendres and Double D's, one can do no better than ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK!

Of course this movie is silly 80's type fluff, but that is the point, it never wants to be more than that and it is perfect as it is. Not sure what it is rated, not appropiate for small kids, lots of low plunging necklines and innappropiate body shots and Las Vegas dancing, but no real cursing(one glaring spelled out exception), just lots of double meanings which quick kids will start to pick up on and ask about.

619660,4,6303265715,"Elvira:Mistress of the Dark, a 1988 horromedy(a comedy with a horror film theme), that stars the title character(whose real name is Cassandra Peterson), is another one of the most underrated of the 1980's. This movie was released as the 1980's were winding down and wasn't a big box office success, which was also panned by most critics. The film is yet another funny and entertaining romp that still holds well today as it did back in 1988.

The whole film starts with Elvira's TV show winding down after showing yet another cheesy horror classic from the past, which she makes her typical cracks about the monster and that it was 90 minutes too long. After a falling out with the new station owner, who kept making advances towards her, she quits and after receiving a telegram about the passing of her great aunt, she heads for the fictional town of Falwell Massachusetts for the reading of the will hoping to get that much needed $50,000 so she can get her Las Vegas act in order. She takes off in her customized '57 T-Bird convertible and heads for Falwell. When she gets there, she is looked down upon by the Morality Club, which is led by a too holier than thou to be believed lady Chastity Pariah(Edie McClurg),but instantly wins the admiration of all the male folk in town. When she attends the reading of her aunt's will, she is flustered and surprised that all she got is her aunt's house, her dog and a recipe book, which unbeknown to her is a book of witches spells that will become one of the main focuses of the story. When she visits the house, she sees that it is a fixer-upper that could be sold once it is fixed up and when she sees her great aunt's french poodle, she punks him up and starts having all the young men and women in the town help her to fix up the old house to sell once it is fixed up. She does arouse the attention of her Great Uncle Vince(W. Morgan Sheppard)who keeps begging her for that recipe book and even offering her money for it, but when Elvira discovers a letter that her great aunt left her, the letter tells her that in no way was she to give the book to her Great Uncle Vincent no matter what, but he is so determined to get that book that he has Elvira locked up for witchcraft, which is the result of a magical stew that she makes for the Morality Club picnic, and also, to have her hanged for it. He feels that with her out of the way, he can now get that book and feels that he has all the power to rule the world once the lunar eclipse happens that night. I won't reveal too much as I don't want to spoil anything for you just in case that you haven't seen it as of yet.

Elvira:Mistress of the Dark is yet another winner that really didn't get the recognition that it deserved. This film is a wonderful film and was one of the most technically well made films ever made. Elvira does indeed steal the show as she is the movies real star and does keep your attention. Elvira is the hottest goth chick ever as she does make up some pretty undemanding fun. Elvira is also the most fun horror film hostess in the history of TV and video. She is not afraid to bare all in regards to the film that she is showing and also, she has a rich self-mocking sense of humor as every 30 seconds, she is always making fun of herself and also, her impressive chest, which does get a lot of focus as the movie continues on. Elvira:Mistress of the Dark is a wickedly funny horror spoof that is knee slapping funny and one of the most hilarious horror spoofs ever made. This film is also one of the best horror spoofs of the 1980's. Elvira does keep you laughing and then some. This film effectively combines both elements of comedy and horror to create one of the most fun movies ever made that can be watched more that just once. She definitely lives up to her name in this wonderfully funny movie and shows that she is definitely ""The chick who put the boob back in the boobtube(I know that she didn't say it quite that way, but she did say that in her own way)"".

The film is written by Peterson, Sam Egan and John Paragon. Her then husband Mark Pierson is the producer and James Signorelli is the director.

The movie really didn't play in most places. The film was also panned by most critics, though some of the critics did like it. The film was not a very big success in theaters, but when released on home video, it became a Top 20 rental tape and also found a new life on cable, and as a result, it has become a cult classic. I don't even remember if this movie played where I live as I don't remember seeing that film in any of my local theaters. As a result, I didn't get a chance to see it. I did see it on home video later when I bought a VHS copy for the heck of it when Anchor Bay reissued this on VHS and when I popped it in and watched it, I enjoyed the film immensely and still do. I would later buy the DVD at Wal-Mart for only $5.00.

PROS: The DVD has the movie looking fresh and new as the colors are all in the right places. There is also a theatrical trailer and a theatrical teaser trailer and a biography of the one and only Cassandra Peterson, the one and only Elvira and THE Elvira as I will never accept any copycats or substitutions.

CONS: No feature length commentary. Not even a documentary where the cast and crew talk about the movie and how much fun they had doing making the movie.

Despite the shortcomings, it is still a wonderful movie and it is worth watching as many times as you like. Elvira rules!!!!

The only award nomination that Elvira received was the nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress, which she lost to Liza Minnelli.

Overall, Elvira:Mistress of the Dark is another one of the most underrated films of the 1980's and is also one of the funniest horror spoofs ever made. If you are a fan of Elvira or of Peterson, by all means add this movie to your DVD library and watch it as many times as you want to. No fan of Elvira, horror films or comedy films should be without this one in their DVD libraries.",1327104000,,6014,4.259194395796848
619731,5,6303265715,"If you're an Elvira fan, you'll definitely enjoy this. I recall seeing this years ago when it first came out and decided one day to buy it. I was NOT disappointed; and neither will you.",1325289600,,185,4.314285714285714
619732,4,6303265715,"The movie features a dude wearing a colander on his head, so you're really going to need Elvira around to make this one palatable.  Despite its great title, They Came From Beyond Space doesn't exactly impress.  It starts OK, but once you spend what seems like an hour watching a guy try to sneak his way onto a farm, a lot of the magic is lost.  I did like the main character, though.  First of all, having a metal plate in your head is just plain cool - that's a well-established fact.  Second of all, Dr. Curtis Temple isn't your average namby-pamby scientist; he's no Captain Kirk (although he does do a mean Kirk imitation whenever he's told to pretend that he just got zapped by some kind of subsonic gun) , but he can hold his own in a fight, even when his opponent keeps smashing him plate-in-head-first into posts.  He does need some serious work on his spying and stealth skills, however.  Fortunately for him, most of the bad guys are just plain dumb most of the time.

Let me take you back to the glory days of yester-year, back before weightlessness in space was even invented, when all you needed for a spaceship control room was some dials, a machine that goes ping, and miscellaneous whatsits, and where proto-MacGyvers could reverse engineer super-advanced alien technology in a matter of hours.  Into this halcyon world a meteorite falls - actually several meteorites.  No big deal, right?  Well, what if I told you that they all fell close together in an obvious formation?  Interested now?  Well, somebody in the British government is, and he puts together a crew of brilliant scientists to go and investigate the thing.  Naturally, Dr. Temple (Robert Hutton) is the obvious choice to lead the group.  Sadly, though, his doctor won't write him a permission slip to go (darn that metal plate in his head), so his assistant Lee (Jennifer Jayne) goes in his place.  Fine and dandy - until, that is, Dr. Temple loses contact with Lee and everyone at the site, even as pork barrel Democrat-sized requisitions start flooding his research lab.  At that point, he tells his doctor to go sit on a tongue dispenser (OK - he doesn't actually do that) and off he goes.

To his surprise, he finds himself persona non grata (him, the great Dr. Temple) when he arrives at the heavily secured site of the meteorite crash.  He doesn't know what's going on, but he knows that the folks working there so secretively are not behaving normally - especially his beloved Lee.  That's where all the sneaking around the farm stuff comes in.  The doc's determined to find out what is going on, despite repeated warnings and murderous attacks.  I won't tell you what the aliens are up to, but I will warn you that their leader can't do anything without giving a long, drawn-out speech first.  What was it with these aliens in the 1960s?  You would think they were all running for Congress given all the boring speeches they made.  And that music?  Each fight scene score was apparently performed by The Little Drummer Boy on acid.

They Came From Beyond Space isn't your typical 1960s science fiction film, but that shouldn't be a selling point in and of itself.  This movie is average at best, with its most memorable moments coming in the form of unintentionally humorous scenes - which Elvira routinely plays up during her most welcome interruptions to what is otherwise a mind-numbingly boring affair.  It's a two-star movie, but the hostess with the mostess makes it a four-star Movie Macabre offering.",1324425600,,3499,4.69016393442623

So, for anyone like me, who isn't really familiar with the Elvira character, I'd recommend giving this movie a shot. There's a good deal of sex humor, so if that's not your thing, maybe you'd pass.

619831,5,6303265715,"For all types and ages of Elvira fans, Cassandra Peterson's alter ego delivers a 5 star performance in the campy, creepy, cleavage busting story about the 'real' Elvira, who upon resigning from her infamous red sofa studio, demanding respect, and getting none, she wallows away in her dressing room, until receiving a telegram, stating her Great Aunt, Morgana Talbot, from Falwell, Massachusetts has passed on, and she is to appear for the reading of the will, as she is 'kin', she has a stake in the inheiratence.
Upon arriving in Falwell, in a decked out, black convertible, complete with barb wire wrapped around the rear view mirror, skulls lining the body of the car, an inverted pentagram inside the steering wheel, leapord print interior, with a license plate reading ""KICK ASS"", the Falwell residents are less then welcoming, to say the least, as the town is about as big as a zip code, and as conservative as the namesake. With a supurb storline, and plot, we get a sneak peak into Elvira's offscreen antics, and along with the one liners, wisecracks, and abundant sexual inuendos, and double entendres, the film, first out in theaters in '88 (which I watched, and LOVED), the DVD has some bonus featurettes as well as the classic movie itself. Co-written by Cassandra Peterson herself, actress/comedienne extrodiaire, this movie will leave you sliding down your own sofa, holding your stomach, from laughing so hard.
I swear, this movie I laughed so hard in, I actually had tears coming out of my eyes, and I've NEVER had that happen as I'm not big on comedies. But this one, trust me, would make old grumpy Uncle Henry even crack a grin. If only for the great cleavage shots...lol. Trust me, boys, you'll LOVE it. And to the rest of the ladies, it proves that you can be a sex symbol, AND an intelligent actress, and heroinne at the same time, as Elvira discovers, when her trademark red ruby ring is much, much more than just a piece of costume jewelry.
Friends, lovers, enemies, idolizers, all are in this unforgettable, laugh a minute spoof on horror movies, with a few scares themselves. Can't stress it enough: This movie is MUCH more than you could ever have thought it would be...",1297296000,2,2198,4.771653543307087

Actress CASSANDRA PETERSON unique version of the vamp is forever cemented in this wonderfully outrageous film that can still take you on a laughable excursion some twenty plus tears later! ELVIRA'S obvious talents and upfront personality are featured gratuitously throughout her misadventures from L.A. to Massachusetts - and then back to Las Vegas for the show stopper of show stoppers! This film expands on the characters cosmology from her MOVIE MACABRE days, and gives her a wonderful wacky witchy family backstory. This film is loaded with camp humor and is bursting with one liners that will make this film one you'll want to view over and over - maybe even make a Halloween tradition; although you'll want to watch it more than just one time a year it's that funny! I've known plenty of people who when down or a little depressed will throw this in their DVD player and afterwards feel soooo mush better as if they have a whole new lease on life - ELVIRA IS BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN PROZAC EVERYONE!!!!!

619891,5,6303265715,"This movie is simply the best horror-film parody ever made. And it's also just one darned enjoyable flick. I guess you could call it a guilty pleasure. True, it is pure cornball, but I have grown to love it, and I watch it regularly every year around Halloween, since (naturally) several channels on TV routinely feature it as part of that select batch of Halloween pictures that just scream for annual broadcasting.

Extremely well filmed (IMHO), I am always really amazed at how nice it is to see it again each year - it holds up well and looks fantastic even today, after 13 years.

From a physical perspective, Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) - with that showgirl figure and that over-the-top tight-fitting black costume - just grabs your attention with both, um, *hands*, from the get go, and never lets go. But there's much more to revel in here than just her physical assets: her acting, her ditzy charm and irreverent risqu&eacute; sense of humor will just have you lapping it up. In short, you'll just love Elvira from top to bottom (unlike the townies in the story, many of whom decidedly did not take kindly to her sudden arrival in their up-tight little burg in Massachusetts).

This movie is just busting out all over with titillating, slightly off-color humor (or: off-colour humour for those of you on the other side of the Atlantic) from start to finish. There are many funny and memorable lines in this movie of the double-entendre variety; it's hard to keep abreast of them all. (I'd list a few of my racier favorites here, but in the interest of not offending the delicate sensibilities of anyone reading this who is NOT into that sort of humor, well, it might be best for you to just go watch the movie and compile your own list).

I can't say anything bad about this movie at all, except that sadly it does end, and you are left wanting more (of Elvira). LOTS more. Alas, c'est la vie.",1251158400,3,1902,4.618343195266272

619894,3,6303265715,"The magnetism radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has a primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, however, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer.

619943,4,6303265715,"Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the television hostess of late-night horror films, and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.  She reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result.

The plot is flyweight.  Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas.  When her great aunt dies, she travels to New England in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show; she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house, a poodle, and an old book.  It happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description, and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes.  It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on ""the old book.""  Throw in a few teenagers, a stud muffin, and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go.

No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece, and it does drag now and then.  But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy, and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy, she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self-mocking jokes.  From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft craziness, she is never less than wildly entertaining.  It's a tremendous amount of fun, and the film's conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense.  Will Elvira best her evil uncle and save the day?  Well, I don't want to give anything away, so let's just say you'll have a lot of fun finding out.

DVD quality is okay and there's little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge.  And if you've never seen tassle-twirling, you're in for a treat.  Recommended.

Elvira doesn't give two hooters as to what people think about the outrageous way she dresses or talks. This poses problems when she visits a conservative town that's concerned about the morality of its citizens. She finally makes the town folks love her for who she is.

620003,4,6303265715,"The lovely Cassandra Peterson dons her famous black dress and wig for the big screen in this hilarious 1988 cult-camp-comedy-classic, and the result is a good time for all! Well, maybe not ALL. Naturally, the humor can get a bit racy, though it's a far cry from today's downright shameless standards! In ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark,"" Cassandra reprises her legendary TV horror hostess role as the character comes to a turning point in her career. Frustrated with an unsatisfying job and blatant sexual harassment from her new boss, the always intrepid Elvira drops everything to pursue her dream of doing her own show in Las Vegas. She THINKS her agent has arranged everything, but gets a rude awakening when she discovers that SHE must come up with fifty thousand dollars to secure the theater. With perfect timing, a message arrives with news of Elvira's mysterious great aunt's sudden passing and requesting her presence at the reading of the will. Elvira's hope is restored, and she packs her bags and hits the road to Massachusetts!

Unfortunately, once Elvira arrives in the small Rockwellian town to which she has been summoned, she discovers that she has only inherited a house, a book, and a dog, none of which she has any use for. Things are only made worse by the fact that the local townsfolk do not want her around; that is, all except for the teenagers who admire her and the men who desire her. In-between fending off unwanted advances and worrying about how she can make worthless lemons into profitable lemonade, Elvira somehow finds the time to take the local kids under her wing and pursue the naive town beefcake as well. In fact, she develops one ingenious solution to bring all of her pet projects together: Putting on a late-night movie show for the kids at her beau's downtown movie theater! The forces seem to be against our heroine, however, in the form of the unfriendly locals. But, the danger of them ruining her show is the least of her worries! Little does Elvira know that her newly discovered Uncle Vincent is a villainous warlock with designs on acquiring her new spell-book, which Elvira thinks is nothing more than a book of exotic cooking recipes! If she's going to save the world, her dreams of stardom, and herself, Elvira will have to discover her true birthright as ""Mistress of the Dark!""

""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" is great campy fun in the true spirit of Cassandra Peterson's beloved television icon! The beautiful prima donna with gothic good-looks and a sharp, wicked, yet well-intentioned and sometimes surprisingly bubbly personality transfers successfully to the big screen thanks to the overflowing talent and charm of the stunning Miss Peterson, who effortlessly carries the film from beginning to end. No question about it, this film is ALL about Elvira, and that's a good thing! Familiar faces dot the cast, and the acting skills vary, but in a goofy, goodtime comedy like this, it all works well together! So, if you are a fond fan like me, or if you are just plain curious, pick up a copy to see this cult-classic for yourself! Great for viewing around Halloween or pretty much anytime! Personally, I recommend (and own) the double-sided DVD with ""Transylvania 6-5000"" on the flipside; Two great Monster comedies, practically for the price of one! That one includes trailers and a thorough, readable bio on Cassandra Peterson. Most likely, this version includes the same extras, though Amazon does not mention the trailers. Sadly, nowhere to be found is the short behind the scenes segment I seem to remember at the end of my old VHS version (which I no longer have).

I was too young to have watched Elvira's TV shows, but I don't think I have been spared at all since the film just bulges with Evira's trademark sassy wit and a fierce determination to be just who she is: a sexy, independent, 'bad girl' (without the bad intentions) wrapped up in a very glamorous package while leaving nothing behind.

I was hoping for a more timely -and just as funny- sequel, but to my dismay, it came over ten years later and had me walking out of the theater before the end.

According to her website, Elvira is not over, thankfully to us fans as she still makes appearances every now and then especially during Halloween time- if you have cable that is...

She's even been recently mentioned as a historical figure in the women's liberation for our time; in a recent issue of Bust, a woman's mag with a feminist slant, the editors even casts her as a feminist icon.

Blowsy Goth Elvira hits small town America with a bang when she inherits a house and a shape changing dog from an old aunt. The prudish folk of this New England town are horrified by her outrageous dress and outspoken ways whilst the youngsters of the town love this excitement that has come into their lives.

There are some hilarious scenes, such as the one where Elvira gives her inherited poodle a 'makeover', turning it into a black, white and pink concoction festooned in leather and studs.

This is a film that could never be called intellectual or even mainstream but for anyone open minded enough to enjoy something a little different, it's certainly worth a look.",1100563200,4,790,4.635714285714286

Elvira throws out the zingers like nobody's business!

A lecherous TV producer walks over and says ""they call me Longhorn, care to guess why?"" She responds, ""Does it have anything to do with your breath?""

And how about the shape-shifting poodle she dresses in leather studded straps and a pink mohawk! Gonk rocks!

Even Edie McClurg pops up as the local town prude and after getting a dose of a love potion laced casserole walks over to a guy laying on the ground and asks, ""Excuse me...is this face taken?"" and plops down right on him!",1095379200,7,585,4.490566037735849
620007,4,6303265715,"I recently had the chance to see the movie Elvira: Mistress of the Dark.  I was expecting pure camp but the camp had a ribbon of intelligent plot running through it.  In the movie Elvira plays her television persona and takes it to the extreme.
After shooting an episode of her show Elvira meets the new station owner who provides a little harassment and drives her to quit on the spot.  Elvira's dream is to perform in Las Vegas.  She has the offer but finds out she has to provide fifty grand as insurance against the show's possible failure.  She does not have the money.  Then a telegram arrives informing her that a great-aunt out East has just passed away and she is named in the will.  So off she goes to Massachusetts.
Once at her destination she finds she is in a small, straight-laced town of seemingly high moral standards.  She is no more happy staying there than the town is.  But when the will is read she finds she has inherited a house, a dog and a recipe book.  There was no money and for some reason an uncle wants the book.  Thinking the book is just a bunch of recipes she tries some out not realizing that she is casting spells.  The book is actually the key to being the master of the dark.  Her aunt had represented the side of good while her uncle the side of evil.
At the uncle's urging Elvira is convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to being burned at the stake.  She manages to use her natural magic abilities to escape just in time to stop her evil uncle.  The townsfolk thank her for what she has done and ask her to stay.  As her uncle's only heir she gets the money she needs for her Vegas debut.  The movie ends with her successful opening and the attainment of her dream.
The film is full of Elvira's style of camp, innuendo and double entendre.  If you can accept that such a character could be then the plot makes plenty of sense.  It was an enjoyable movie with a strong fish-out-of-water theme that has been successful in so many films.  The film is also peppered with some great classic rock such as Screaming J. Hawkins's I Put a Spell on You thus making the an enjoyable framework for the action.",1088035200,11,2137,4.335012594458438

When she inherits a house in New England she doesn't know her evil uncle is after a book of spells within. With two bumbling henchmen he seeks to get it. Elvira ends up saving the day with the help of the neighborhood kids and Gonk!

The woman with the skintight, low-cut black dress, black pantyhose, & black bouffant wig used to host horror movies on TV in the 1980s, but here she stars in one of her own. Upon learning of the death of a great-aunt she didn't know she had, El embarks across the country to a small Massachusetts town named Falwell (after Rev. Jerry Falwell) to find out what she has inherited. This town is like Salem all over again--prudishness, religious fanaticism, hypocrisy, & witch trials. It's bad enough for El to face an adversary like Chastity Pariah (the upholder of the town's morals) & also get sexually harassed by a few creepy guys, but her most dangerous foe is her late great-aunt's brother & rival for the inheritance of a powerful recipe book that would make its possessor Master (or Mistress) of the Dark. Even the VHS version has a post-movie featurette about its making, in which Cassandra (in her Elvira costume) notes how the plot loosely parallels her own life; I might add that the movie's ending is reminiscent of her Las Vegas showgirl days.",1065916800,5,1233,4.634703196347032

620139,3,6303265715,"Sure, the plot  heavily relies on raunch and horror and at times comes across like The Addams Family meets Melrose Place, but Elvira emerges as an unlikely heroine for women in this film.
While much of her success has been written as stemming from her physical endowments, and this film also highlights them, it also focuses on her resourcefullness and her willingness to stand up for what she honestly believes in.
Passivity is not in her genes either as she displays her (admirable) attitude when faced with judgemental and bigoted people or defends herself against lecherous men who can't keep their hands to themselves.
There is no way she is going to let the town bigots rain on her parade and she is going to do her own thing regardless of whatever they want. Elvira even makes it a point to stand up for the rights of the repressed kids in the town and takes the granddaughter of a motel owner under her wing.
Finally, the link to her mother Davana and voice urging her to ""use the power"" to free herself from danger speaks of women's history, however jumbled. Elvira is really one link in a long string of the original powerful and independent woman--the witch!!
Sure, it's not the most realistic plot in the world, but Ms. Peterson's alter ego is a liberated woman who does not take garbage from any other character in the film and makes it clear that she is not subservient to men.",981072000,9,1391,4.586345381526105

Fired from her late-night Public Access television show, Elvira gets another chance at fame and fortune when her long-lost Great Aunt Morgana dies and leaves her as the sole heir of the will.  It's off to the small G-rated town of Falwell (get it?!), where Elvira soon finds herself a duck out of water in a community full of dim-witted yokels, led by Chastity Pariah (Edie McClurg).

Can Elvira manage to save her skin--before the town morality leaders decide to burn her as a witch?  And what the heck was the ""secret ingrediant"" in Elvira's casserole?!

ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK is full of the same fun and campy good humour that marked her appearances hosting ""Elvira's Movie Macabre"" on television.  She has an instantly appealing comedy style and holds the entire film together with her zany character.  The cast also includes William Morgan Shepperd, Susan Kellerman, Jeff Conaway, Daniel Greene and Pat Crawford-Brown.

All the same this is a funny film that left me hysterical with  laughter when I first saw it several years ago.  Cassandra Peterson is  great as Elvira, a young woman who inherits a house in small-town America.  However, small town USA isn't really read for Elvira who is big, brassy, a  tart with a heart and totally OTT.  Also the aforesaid small town USA isn't  ready for the problems that follow Elvira to her new inheritance because  (unknown to Elvira) she is the daughter of a witch and that her scheming  and on the surface respectable Uncle (also a Warlock) wants her inheritance  for his own dastardly reasons.  Somewhere in the house is a book of very  powerful spells and Elvira's Uncle wants it at all costs.  At first Elvira  wants only to sell the house and head for the bright city lights but she  soon finds herself fighting for her birthright which includes a magic ring,  the missing spell book and Witches Familiar in the form of funky poodle who  can become a Rotwieller if the need arises.  Elvira makes does make friends  along the way, mainly young people like herself who feel constrained by  their town's ultra conservative attitude.  Elvira is soon mixing potions to  liven up the town especially after they cruelly ruin a show she puts on to  make some money.  Watch out for the sex-fest which occurs after the town's  people eat a specially prepared casserole at the local fair, it is one of  the films funniest moments.  The film follows Elvira's attempt to defeat  her evil and powerful Uncle, not easy when you are witch without training  and Elvira's transformation into a female Rambo complete with Bazooka gun  is totally hysterical.  This is a silly, silly, film but it is well worth  watching as the special effects aren't bad, the acting is adequate but most  of all it is enjoyable, funny and totally screwy.

I always liked Elvira since I was a young lad and she an inspiration to those of us who are not like the masses, nor want to be.  I have always liked the macabre and Elvira is a great addition to that.  This is a fun ""B"" movie and Elvira's best in my opinion.  Have fun.",1518912000,,438,4.166666666666667
