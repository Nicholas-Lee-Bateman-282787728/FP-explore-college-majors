8535382,3,B0093SS86I,"I watched the original 1931 English version of this film on TV. It is kind of granny and there are no captions to be able to see the spoken words, and the words I heard were slightly garbled. It is about two very close friends who are in love with the same attractive but somewhat zaftig woman, being slightly fat was the style at the time. The film raises the question: can friendship between two men be more important to them than the love of a woman?
The two friends are officers in the British army and stationed together in India. The woman is married and her husband blackmails the men - for reasons that I do not understand, perhaps so as not to disclose their lack of morality, of having an affair with a married woman. The two men know that their friend loves the same woman he loves. The two friends return to England. The husband is killed. The woman appears in England at a house they are visiting with a fiance.
I gave the show only three stars because the answer to the question seems obvious to me, because the film is not exciting, and the film is granny.",1501027200,,1071,4.306930693069307
