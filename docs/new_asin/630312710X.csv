8585323,5,630312710X,"Ordered this thru Amazon for Dad: an old 'limey.  The transaction was smooth.  And, with the direct delivery, Dad got the VCR promptly.  He loves it.  I feel great in replacing his original VCR tape that he wore out!  Thanks to Amazon for getting me touch with a used VCR tape....... it's ""out of print"" and this option allowed me to find a gently-used tape.

thanks!
