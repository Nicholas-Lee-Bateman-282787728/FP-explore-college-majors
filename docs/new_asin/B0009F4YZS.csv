2699502,5,B0009F4YZS,"This is a very old school genre western and it works, mostly because Buster Crabbe was basically born to play these roles. It's a classic story - bad men try to turn people against each other so they can steal their land. Of course a  hero in a white hat rides into town and with the power of his six gun manages to make peace with the town people and at the same time drive out the bad guys. If you like this type of western this is one of the most well done ones you will find.",1153785600,,479,3.8877551020408165
2699503,5,B0009F4YZS,"Buster Crabbe was the main  hero of the Wild West for about a decade and films like t his explain and demonstrate exactly why. He's a rugged imposing figure with a six gun, always fighting on the r ight side of the moral dilema. In this case it's a classic land grab where the bad guys try to force people out of their homes and he comes to the rescue. It has been restored well without some of the glitches that I've seen in many older films on television. That sound is also good.",1148342400,2,482,4.127659574468085
2699504,5,B0009F4YZS,"""Rarely are brains associated with brawn but Buster Crabbe was a fine example of this unusual fusion. He knew what audiences expected from him and delivered it in style. Oath of Vengeance offers proof of how Buster could take an ordinary plot and turn it into a crowd-puller in his own inimitable style. Buster did a lot to uplift the troubles minds of wartime America and needs to be commended in a big way for this.""",1146528000,,418,4.5131578947368425

8159795,1,B0009F4YZS,"This was one of the most contrived, poorly-acted bunch of Old West drivel I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Buster Crabbe spends half of the movie guffawing with a put-on belly laugh supposedly making fun of his ignoramus side kick. The trouble is that nothing in this movie is even remotely humorous. The other half of the movie you'll find Crabbe getting beaten up, but somehow he always gets the last punch in and thus winning every fight.

This was my first Buster Crabbe experience and I won't be suckered in for a second go-around. Save your time and watch an episode of the Lone Ranger. At least the masked man with the silver bullet had some class.",1406937600,,661,4.554621848739496

The story concerns the outlaw problems that  both local ranchers and farmers are experiencing in a wave of trouble that unknown to them is being orchestrated by businessman Steve Kinney, played by Jack Ingram, and his henchmen.

Jones,played by Al St. John, afraid of losing the outstanding accounts on his books due to the impending range war, gets his pal, Billy Carson, played by Buster Crabbe, to join him in proving who's behind the ruckus. With Mady Lawrence, Charles King, Kermit Maynard, Marin Sairs, Karl Hackett.

OATH OF VENGEANCE is a very entertaining ""B""western with some pretty funny comic bits contributed by Al St. John, who plays Fuzzy Q. Jones.  I rate it a Four Star ""B"" movie.",1285545600,,832,4.830985915492958
