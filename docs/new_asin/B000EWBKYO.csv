Polite and tranquil, in appearance, our time can easily take the highs and lows out of the artistic output.  Stripped of such attributes, new-art often lives on fabricated edges.  In the western societies, that is.

Today's Israel, place where worlds collide, is as much a struggle as ever-evolving normalcy.  What is the Israeli artist's purpose?

Haim Bouzaglo, the auteur and protagonist of/in this film, gives us his answer to all the above: The artist has to confront each one of us with the truth, and in so doing s/he has to dig deep down into it and reflect as much of the world as facets in the work of art.  By so doing, Bouzaglo could easily have become repugnant, for not everybody is the exhibitionist of their own darker spots, regardless of some artistic purpose.  Yet, he inserts so many shreds of humanity that you start feeling for his characters and realize his being nonjudgmental.  For example, take the scene where two adulterers call their respective families during a terrorist attack to take care of their own domestic lives.  Or, the same two, during the ensuing lovemaking scene, witness the terrorist drama unfolding on TV and talk about the casualties in terms of ""WHAT'S THE SCORE?""

One may take issue with the incomplete character definition of the terrorist who blows himself up, yet I don't think this was some political calculation.  I suspect he did so for terrorism has seldom proper names, in spite of, and due to, being so pervasive a character in everyone's daily act.  And, for that matter, neither are re-presented the Israeli extremists.  In other words, it is as if the director withholds political clues.  Which may be in itself a sign of above mentioned normalcy.

As far as the film itself, I wonder about the editing and camera handling, whereby the image on the screen is jolted periodically as if to shake one's senses up, to jolt the viewer.  Was it overdone, at times?",1197331200,,2044,4.827586206896552
