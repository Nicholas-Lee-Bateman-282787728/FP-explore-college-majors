647104,5,6303450199,"First, how I came to be watching this superb kid's video. I'm working on a lady's computer. In the same room is her TV, over to my left. Her 3-year-old granddaughter is watching this video, singing along, dancing,  clapping, reciting the words spoken.
Not a bad kid's film, thought I. It  was about the third time around that I found myself getting into it and  humming along. The little actress in the red party dress is wonderful as  Sally. Her dancing is lively and animated, yet so natural. Her expressions  are perfect, not gee-whizish when gee-whiz isn't called for. Good singing  voice. She's every bit as good as Shirley Temple was at the same age --  more natural and less theatrical. The other players do their jobs, too. The  marching band is good and the kids' pantomimic playing of trombones, flutes  and other instruments is a nice little touch.
The tight beat of the  music, the sharpness of the drums, the one-voice sound of the choral  singing all combine to give the music a captivating quality.
Amazon.com's review wasn't quite the back of a hand, but wasn't much  above it. Garish? I thought the production was colorful. Poorly lit? It  sparkled for me. Amateurishly shot and edited? With more than 30 syndicated  TV shows under my producer/director belt I didn't see those defects. A  comprimised choice for kids? After 15 years this video is still Amazon's  number 12 best-seller for kid sing-alongs, has sold in the millions of  copies. The lady whose computer I was working on said this he her 3rd copy  of Wee Sing Together -- wore out the other two. The slip cover was  positively tattered from use. Maybe Amazon needs kid reviewers for kid  material.
Lacking that, old fogies like me will do. When I returned the  next day with computer parts the lady thoughtfully tuned the TV to the  History Channel. ""Uh ... well ... Norma, do you have that Wee Sing  video handy?""",959299200,60,1894,4.689969604863222

All their parents were thrilled because they remembered these videos from their childhoods, too. Of the series, this first in the series was one of their favorites. We always called this ""Sally's Birthday,"" and my kids, now in their 20's, still know the songs. For that matter, so do my husband and I!  Per my nieces' parents, this youngest generation in our family is now also mesmerized by this DVD.

647533,5,6303450199,"I am nearly 32 years old and have always had a memory of this VHS tape that I used to watch ALL the time as a child.  My mom and I would walk to the neighborhood library and every single time I would check out this tape.  Finally my mom said enough was enough and I wasn't allowed to get it anymore.  The tape was forgotten but as I grew up I always had that thought in the back of my mind that there was a tape I just loved as a kid and couldn't get but I could never remember what it was.  Then I saw a post from a friend about WeeSing and it clicked that that was the tape I had loved so much as a young girl.  I immediately ran to Amazon and thank goodness, a DVD is available today.  I picked this up mostly for my 4.5 year old daughter but my 3 year old son likes it as well.  I have a 17 month old too, but it doesn't really hold her attention much yet.  My daughter just loves this movie (maybe not as much as I did, but she does really like it) and asks to watch it all the time.  I have recently started searching for more of my favorite tapes from my childhood to get for my kids and sadly, many of them aren't available on DVD so I am just thrilled we were able to get this one!!",1456272000,2,1191,3.7701612903225805

647537,5,6303450199,"We have this video and my twin 3 year old boys LOVE it.  They ask for it at least once a day.  They can sing and dance along.  The songs start out slow and speed up, so they can learn them easily.  It is VERY dated, but I find that amusing.  I was too old to watch this when it came out originally, so this is new to me - but it is catchy even now.  I have tried a few other Wee Sing videos and a couple other Kids Song videos, but this one seems to be the only one my kids like and really enjoy.  Some of the other ones have camera angles that constantly change while this one holds a scene and just watches - holding their attention.",1454457600,,635,3.801526717557252

647650,1,6303450199,"Having never seen a Wee sing video before, I purchased this for my 18 month old grandson for Christmas. I played it for him over the weekend. In the beginning he was frightened by the rather odd looking bear?, but after reassuring him and then him seeing the children interacting with him, he relaxed and seemed to enjoy.  That is, until the part where the storm comes with thunder and lightning and they all run into a cave and begin screaming in fear!  My grandson freaked out and started crying in fear. He wouldn't stay in the room until I turned it off.  After calming him I asked if we could try to continue watching and he shook his head and started trembling!  It truly traumatized him. WHY would you put something like that in a children's video?? To say I am disappointed is an understatement! I will never purchase one of these videos again.",1451260800,3,852,4.47741935483871

I am so happy I can watch these with her and see her get excited and sing the songs.  I sing and dance with her and it makes me feel like a kid again!  This is one of the best shows ever made for kids with active imaginations that love pretend play and music.  It teaches through both and I haven't met a kid yet that didn't love this movie.  I've recently lost it and will be repurchasing it.  Even after I find the old one it will work out well because my daughter will have one at home and one at grandma's house!  After all, what kid doesn't need her favorite things at both locations?  Frozen is another one of those movies that we have at each house :)  It's better to do that then worry about forgetting a favorite show at home or at grandma's and of course have that be the only show your kid wants to watch before bedtime!",1428278400,2,947,4.153846153846154

2 3/4 year old grandson LOVED IT! He watched it five times in a row on it's debut in my home. He asked for it again the next time he came over. He wanted to take it home to his house. My daughter-in-law said that we should leave it so it can be a special thing when he comes to Bubbie's house! ( She was not familiar with it and thinks it a bit creepy and old fashioned)  My 10 month granddaughter was rocking out to it also.",1419292800,,567,3.805084745762712

648036,3,6303450199,A bit dated. Their actions are slow at times and I wished there was more action to keep my granddaughter more entertained. It's like a play on a low budget. Not bad but I was hoping for more as the Wee Sing songs are so much better.,1411948800,,232,3.9574468085106385

648113,5,6303450199,"This video has been my SAVING GRACE since having a second baby, and needing to entertain a 2 year old big sister. I have started to buy this video as a gift for everyone I know who has a child age 2-7. Boy or girl doesn't matter. Its that good!

I grew up watching this video as a kid and still remember it.  When I realized it was still on dvd, I decided to purchase it.  My daughter absolutely LOVES it and I have since bough 5 other Wee sing DVD's.  We have bought many Disney movies and similar cartoons, which all inevitably have a scary or sad part in the movie, which ends up really upsetting my young child. These are the only movies I know of that can hold a very active child's attention, over and over again.  We watch this video once a day, which gives me a chance to spend an hour of undivided attention with my infant, make dinner, take a shower, or tend to many of the nearly impossible tasks with a new baby and a 2 year old in the house.  This video cost only $10 from amazon, and I would have seriously have paid over $100 for how much it entertains my daughter.
This is our favorite of the 5 wee sing dvd's we own, however all are amazing. The songs, dancing, and child friendly story line is perfect. This movie is about friends who attend a girls birthday party, and several of her gifts come to life, singing and dancing. There are several positive messages delivered through the movie like sharing and good manners. There are an equal number of boys and girls in the video, so its totally appropriate for both genders.  I recommend you buy this video immediately before it starts selling for $100, because its worth it!",1407888000,3,1642,4.294498381877022
648114,5,6303450199,"I remember watching this in the early '90's. It's definitely a little interesting, but there are familiar songs & all appropriate for little kids. My girls (ages 3&5) love it!

He loves to dance so I thought if we could watch the video and sing and dance along to songs like 'Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes'  it would be useful for him however, this video is unwatchable.  The kids are over the top with their expressions and tone, and the adults in costumes are freaky looking.  I was first disappointed when they didn't even do the traditional hand movements with the song I bought the DVD for, but kept an open mind while continuing on with the video.  It just got worse.

We asked if he was scared (no). We asked him if he liked it (no!). We asked him if we wanted to stop it (said and signed, please). This is a kid who loves Sesame Street, Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, and other programs with fantasy characters that treat and interact with kids and adults as something other than babyfied zombies. He loves being read to, is starting to count, is identifying letters, loves all sorts of music (the shows are a treat). This is the first time he wanted something to stop.

Easy to follow storyline and the dialogue is not too complicated-- I'd recommend 2-5 yrs old.

648826,5,6303450199,"(People who are neither parents nor baby-sitters: this review is not for you.)

Do you ever have an urgent need for a bunch of small kids to be quiet and still for an hour? This video is more effective than even cough-syrup and duct-tape used together.

There's nothing remotely harmful or controversial in it. It takes a skeleton of a story (stuffed animals whisk the children away to a fairyland for a birthday party) and hangs lots (and lots...) of chirpy, perky songs on it.

Simply assemble the kids in a room, hit the Play button, and quickly leave, closing the door behind you. If you skip that last part, you will instantly be infected by chirpy, perky ear-worms that could well embarrass you later as you hop and skip your way around the supermarket  singing: ""Skidamarink a dink a dink, Skidamarink a doo..."" (Yes, I wish I was just imagining this part.)

At the end of the hour, your kids will emerge to find that you're much more capable of dealing with them pleasantly and calmly. Don't think your kids won't notice: the next time you patiently and loudly tell them ""BECAUSE I SAY SO!"" they might well ask: ""Dad: can we watch ""Wee Sing?""

And don't for a moment think this works only once: unlike cough-syrup, it can be used almost daily for years with no lingering side-effects. Take great care of the DVD: it will be played more often than any other you own.",1287273600,6,1373,4.538461538461538

However, since that time, plenty of cousins and family friends have borrowed our video and become obsessed.  I can think of  occasions when 3 different families have begged us to give them the video because their kids (ranging from ages 4-9) love it so much that they will watch it over and over and over again.  (My mother wouldn't relinquish probably out of sentimentality reasons.)  Now 20 years later, my daughter is 1.5 yrs old and we dug this video out to show her.  She sat still for quite awhile watching it, something she has not done for any other video or program.  I'm going to have to purchase the DVD for my own home.

I can't say that as an adult, it's a particularly enjoyable movie.  The kids all overact every single line and exaggerate their facial expressions to the extreme.  That said, the singing is fairly good, and the dancing and concept is cute.  I don't know what the magic element is, but it seems to work to keep kids enthralled.  Most of the songs are classics:  Itsy bitsy spider, Bingo, Old MacDonald, If you're happy and you know it, Head Shoulders Knees & Toes, Rain Rain Go Away, etc.

If you have kids aged 4-8, I'd highly recommend it.  Although I wouldn't recommend having your kids live in front of the tv screen, it's good for parents to have a secret weapon that will guarantee an hour of quiet while getting important chores done occasionally.",1185494400,31,1542,4.473118279569892

It went through my two siblings, and even when i was 8 I'd watch it with my little sister and dance along and sing!
Then it got packed away for a few years til i started babysitting, I've brought it along with me to pretty much ever job I've had and I haven't met a kid yet would could resist jumping up and singing with it! (parents...makes a great bribe *wink*) Now I'm a professional nanny, and the kiddos currently have it for the weekend...they've been borrowing it every other week for months now! Great movie, highly recommended by an ex-kid who loved it!",1087948800,3,1048,4.117073170731707
649302,5,6303450199,"When I was about two I was hooked to watching Wee Sing Together.  I watched it so much that the tape ran out, I haven't seen it in years, yet I remember the plot and how I wanted to be just like Sally.  My sister, who is three years younger than me, also enjoyed it.  Her favorite however was Wee Sing In Sillyville, which I enjoyed, but it could never take the place of the original.  Then, when my youngest sister, who is eight years younger than I am, was about two she ditched all of her horrid Barney videos for Grandpa's Magical Toys, another delightful Wee Sing video.  To sum it all up: over the years, Wee Sing has brought our family a lot of entertainment, out of the entire series Wee Sing Together, Wee Sing in Sillyville and Grandpa's Magical Toys are the best in the series.",1068940800,,788,4.261744966442953

She would watch that tape up to 7 times in one day. It was a huge hit in our family. Now my daughter is 20. But I now have a grandaughter who is 5. Guess what? ""Wee Sing Together"" is still in great shape and my grandaughter loves it also. She watches it every chance she gets. Just how long can this tape last? I really want to get another one, just for her. That tape was the best tape to ever come into my home. My 20 year old daughter still watches it to. Thanks for such a great film.

649304,5,6303450199,"Way back when (in 1991) I watched this video every day at least once a day.  If not this I often took trips to Sillyville, or Grandpa's Magical Toy Shop.  Now I am 15 and I had almost forgotten this glorious video when the other night we started reciting songs and names of characters.  My favorite moment was remembering the notes around Melody Mouse's dress.
Now we recall every word and the dance to skinamarinki-dinki-dink (is that how u spell it? haha) and are seriously considering buying it since we cant find our original copy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANY YOUNG CHILDREN!!!!",1057622400,,582,4.732673267326732
649305,2,6303450199,"When I was 2 years old, I watched this movie over and over and over and over.  My parents nearly slit their throats.  They still bemoan the thing that is ""Little Sally.""  I, personally, loved it.  Then, while packing up for a move, I discovered it and rewatched it.  I almost wretched.  Horrible!  Horrible horrible horrible!  I'm sure that most 2 year olds love it, and if you're the kind of parent that doesn't mind letting your kids watch it ALONE, go ahead.  But if you're one of those parents that carefully screens the TV for things and ALWAYS sits with your kids while they watch -- look out.  Little Sally left a lasting scar on my parents, and she could for you too.
I'm only upset this isn't listed at IMDB.  I would love to know what else Little Sally has done during her brilliant acting career.  (If the actress who played Sally ever reads this -- my sincere apologies.  I'm sure you're a very nice person and probably a good actress.  This just rubbed me wrong way.)

649308,4,6303450199,"This video is my 2-year old daughter's absolute favorite.  She used to be addicted to Elmo and Ernie on Sesame Street.  Now, I can't get her to watch her videos of them any more.  This is both a blessing and a curse if you watch it with your child since you won't be able to shake the melodies (as my neighbor who gave me the video warned me).
At her age, I'm happy to see her get so interested in the songs and dancing of this video.  She enjoys singing and dancing along with the songs.  The little girl, Sally, also teaches manners by example throughout the video.
Her other favorite is Wee Sing in Sillyville, which shares many of the same attributes, but has a subtle meassage about getting along with each other, even though we all may be different.",995846400,4,755,4.326241134751773

I had given the original to my friend who had 2 young sons and the watched it everyday just like my older daughters did. They still say it was their favorite video to watch. Now my 2 year old daughter loves it as much if not more than they did, their brother isn't old enough to understand it yet, he's only 7 months old. I'm convinced he will love it as much as the rest of them did.

They also had another tape at their grandmother's house so they could watch it there. The songs are fun  for kids to learn to sing and dance along with.  The bear and the mouse  made them laugh with delight. And Sally... Well, let's just say girls LOVE  Sally. I think we watched this tape at least three times a day, and that is  a minimum amount! It truly captures a child's imagination. Get it and watch  it with your children. But be prepared to catch yourself humming and  singing the tunes too. Delightful!",964656000,,630,4.379310344827586
