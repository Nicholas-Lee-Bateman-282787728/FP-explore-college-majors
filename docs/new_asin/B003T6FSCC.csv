8404989,5,B003T6FSCC,"This is a fantastic video to watch.  The dancing is superb from everyone, especially Michael Flatley.  He is very entertaining.  The music is wonderful too!  This item came quickly and was packaged safely.",1307145600,,205,5.121212121212121
8404990,5,B003T6FSCC,"Have just watched Feet of Flames in Taiwan on dvd and found it was so awsome that I felt compelled to comment about it. The hairs on the back of my neck were tingling all the way through. The pictures are so clear, you really feel you are there. I can't wait to watch it again. I recommend this to everyone. Keep dancing!",1297900800,,321,4.111111111111111
8404991,3,B003T6FSCC,"I was disappointed in this video.  It was a re-make with a different cast.  I saw the show in Dallas and clips from the Gold video and had hoped it would be more of the same with an Egyptian twist.  I still enjoy seeing Michael dance but since he doesn't dance in the South and close to me, not so much.",1292371200,,303,3.9344262295081966
8404992,3,B003T6FSCC,"I have been a fan of Michael Flately ever since he came tapping into living rooms around the world as a member of Riverdance.  I watched in awe when Lord of the Dance came out and again when FoF came out when it was recorded at Hyde Park.  I was excited when I heard on the MFer's Facebook page that FoF Taiwan was going to be released on DVD.  I bought it and here's my review:

First of all, this isn't like the FoF at Hyde Park.  Several numbers are missing, most notably the first song that Erin the Goddess sings called ""Marble Halls"" as well as Siamsa (Dance Above the Rainbow) at the beginning of the film.  The monks routine (also called High Priests according to the chapter title card for the FoF DVD) is also gone, but the soundtrack for Hell's Kitchen later on in the movie still has them chanting in the background, but they aren't there.  The band number and ""Whistling Wind"" (MF's flute solo) towards the ending of the second act of FoF Hyde Park is gone and for some strange reason, the gasp Gillian Norris did in the original LOTD when she's dancing with the MFer is still in the soundtrack for the latter shows, even though MF only pulled Gillian's hair in the original LOTD.  Listen for the gasp when MF and Morrighan are dancing together during Stolen Kiss.

Michael Flately is awesome when he dances.  There is no other word I can think of to describe him.  He's over 50 years old by this time and still dances like he did twelve years ago when FoF Hyde Park was released.  The man can dance. I was excited to see him back dancing in the title role and to see leading lady Bernadette Flynn-O'Kane back dancing as the Irish coleen.  It would have been better to see Gillian Norris back as Morrighan the Temptress and Daire Nolan back as the Dark Lord, but since they've both gone on to do other things, two other dancers fill in for them.  Helen Egen who played the Little Spirit in both LOTD and FoF Hyde Park is also gone, having been replaced by a tall blonde who dances a little too happily for my tastes in some of the more dramatic moments.  With Cora Smith and Mirad Nesbitt both now on other projects, the two fiddle players have also been replaced with two other ladies who do a good job during Strings of Fire.  My favorite act which is `Breakout' or as I like to call it, the Strip Jig, is still great.  It's so nice to see Bernie back in the leading lady role. She does a fantastic job as Saoirse.

There are no extra features on this disc.  On both the LOTD disc and FoF Hyde Park disc, there were behind the scenes commentaries, which I love to watch.  This one had nothing.  I would have loved to see a behind the scenes feature or an interview from MF as to why he returned, but alas, we get nothing.

One thing I will say about this disc is the annoying camera angles and the slow mo replays are gone.  That was one thing that bugged me most about both LOTD and FoF.  When the replay in slow motion of the MFer jumping in a dance move or something happens, we missed part of the show.  In this FoF edition, there are no fancy camera angles and no slow mo replays. This is a straight cut no special camera tricks movie.  In parts, it looks like it's being filmed with a handheld camcorder, but at least I got to see the MFer dance again.

I'm a fan of the show, so I bought this disc.  I'd probably buy a disc that had the MFer tapping to someone reading names out of the Memphis, TN phone book.  I know a lot of people won't like it. It's not as flashy as FoF Hyde Park was, but it's still the FoF show, but just on a much smaller scale and to the true FoF fan, this is a must have.",1288569600,3,3619,4.181818181818182
8404993,2,B003T6FSCC,"When word came along in 2009 that Michael Flatley was going to take the stage for the first time since his Celtic Tiger tour, I was ecstatic!  The performance, titled Feet of Flames (FOF), took place in Taiwan in December of 2009.  This dvd is that show.  I am a huge fan of Flatley.  The guy has inspired me beyond belief, but this disc does anything but that.  First off, this is just Lord of the Dance on steroids.  Granted, LOTD is an incredible show, but there is nothing new here.  What's confusing is the fact that there are two Feet of Flames shows that Flately has put on.  The original (also available on dvd), was his retirement from the show...a one-off performance combining both his touring LOTD troupes from 1998.  It was and still is the best Irish dance dvd out there.  Then there was the touring FOF which had an Egyptian flare to it.  It was entertaining and somewhat fresh, but still contained a lot of the LOTD numbers, though this version has never been released in its entirety on disc (only a few numbers seen on Michael Flatley Gold).

I was hoping his Taiwan performance was the latter, providing a hint of Cleopatra.  Unfortunately, it was Lord of the Dance all over.  Sure it can still be entertaining to watch and doesn't have the hurried cut-cut-cut editing that the original LOTD dvd had.  This new dvd also has some photography that makes it feel live, though I don't understand how it's billed as high definition.  It's a dvd.  It is impossible for it to be high definition.  Why didn't they release this on Blu-ray so that claim would hold true??

In the end, Flatley doesn't have the energizing pinache that he once so eloquently delivered on stage with striking vibrance.  The show on this disc is full of talent, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, save for a wee bit more tired Flatley.  The man knows his limits and is well aware he can't do what he did 15 years ago.  Still, a Blu-ray version of the Egyptian-style Feet of Flames would have been preferred.  It would have been newer material and true 1080 high def.  In the end, ""Feet of Flames RAW"" comes across looking like it was shot in a high school auditorium lacking significant amounts of energy.",1288483200,,2199,4.522842639593908
