8202875,1,B000RWDHJC,Did not like this one.  Couldn't stand the constant interuptions by the singers.  Not a bollywood love story.  I could buy Hollywood movies and get the same junk.  Threw the DVD out.,1280102400,,182,4.59375
8202876,5,B000RWDHJC,"Because I'm a fan of Indian movies of all kinds, I can't really predict how someone new to Bollywood will see this one, but I should think any kind of film buff will appreciate it for its outstanding characterizations (some of the world's finest actors are here), breadth of perspective (in its many characters, its urban setting), its fabulous music (integrated into the movie in a very original way, for Bollywood - very effective), its fine, edgy cinematography capturing life in Mumbai, and its thoroughly engaging story that keeps the viewer challenged with just enough complexity. And especially if you're a Bollywood fan with modern sensibilities, this one should seem just about perfect. In spirit, it's part modern world culture, part old Indian values, and part old Hollywood character-driven glitzy storytelling - all somehow blended in a perfect balance that should fascinate many viewers. I loved it.",1232841600,,913,5.217687074829932
8202877,3,B000RWDHJC,"Vowing not to watch a hindi film in a cinema after my last few debacles in so called `biggies' until and unless something exceptional came about. Somehow call it the real 'cinetic instincts' I had my eyes set on Metro since I got to know the that the film was shot in Bombay (as they say, ""you can leave Bombay, but Bombay never leaves you"". I choose to still call it Bombay and not Mumbai) and its theme and its reviving music were convincing enough reasons to go ahead.

In last few months there've been a handful of hindi films with a multi-layer narrative, so nothing new there but here the director (Anurag Basu) initiates by smoothly shaping the connection between his different stories/characters right at the start, making it easier to go further rather than get confused, which can easily happen with this genre if there is no control over the script.

An ensemble of imperfect characters/stories in the city of Bombay where loneliness and selfishness demand more importance than love and sensitivity and all this in the name of ambitions. This film takes us to the tagline from the film 'Lost in Translation' - ""Everyone Wants to be found"". So the characters of this film in the quest of being found, either ends up making wrong choices (Kangana-Kay Kay) or good-choice-tuned-sour-over-the years (Shilpa-Kay Kay) or one-side love (Sharman-Kangana or Shiney-Shilpa) or a later-in-life-realisation (Dharmendra-Nafisa Ali) or not-identifying-the-one-next-to you (Irrfan-Konkona).

Don't remember in a recent time when Bombay looked at its natural best in a film as it did in this one (superbly shot by Bobby Singh). The real side of Bombay by the day and night, on the roads, by the bus stops, in the bus, on the railway stations, in the trains and all this delightfully drenched in the ever famed rains of Bombay, that creates an atmosphere which is romantic, magical and at the same time melancholic.

Character development is director's job and the delivery (thru acting) is actor's job. Every actor here delivers his/her part well, particularly Irrfan & KoKo (you come to know why these two are considered the talented/gifted actors around in their own right. One feels wanting more for the scenes where each of them are present or both of them together), Sharman (one more feather after RDB), Kay Kay (effortless), Shilpa (she is come a long way, but still not there yet, unfortunately for this tall beauty, her BB fame in UK cannot put her a notch above in acting), Shiney (sadly wasted and his track with Shilpa was unclear and underdeveloped as his character), Dharmendra & Nafisa Ali (the surprise couple-cute oldies), Kangana (whats with her dialogue delivery and showing off her legs and those blank cold looks on her face?!)

The music by Pritam and his band in black are placed in the film uniquely without disturbing the flow of the film and stretching it in length. Although it looks a little unrealistic after a while, still the music and lyrics make up for that oddity. `Rishtey', `In Dino', `Alvida' ,`O Meri Jaan', are my favourites in that order.

There are some wonderful dialogues by Sanjeev Dutta dialogues that depict precisely characters' inner world. As in when Shilpa asks Shiney ""Did you leave your wife or she left you?"" he replies with ""Love left us"" (skilfully shot this). Or Shilpa's voiceover explaining the distance between her and Kay Kay ""Now even our silence fights with each other."" Or Dharmendra telling, ""The Search never ends.. Time does!"" or some comical ones with some depth mouthed by Irrfan to KoKo after he asked her to shout out her frustrations on a terrace top ""Your servicing is done"" or Sharman declaring ""I'm here for a race, not for a morning walk"" and so on and so forth.

Basu cleverly balances two tracks with happy ending out of the four. But at the same time not enforcing any judgements about any of his characters. At the end there is something distinctly honest about this film that reaches its audience, making him/her only feel glad about watching it!",1187049600,3,4021,4.869883040935672
