7295418,3,B00ZVC2R5S,The film was shot in 1:85. The Blu-Ray is mastered in 1:78. Come on people. This is one of the best films ever made. Get your head on straight. I'm owed the correct canvas. The specs should be listed.  Looks good otherwise. Many fantastic special features.,1464998400,3,256,4.565217391304348

7295425,3,B00ZVC2R5S,"I own Dog Day Afternoon on BD, and wanted to know whether to upgrade to this 40th anniversary edition.  It didn't take a lot of detective work to figure out what this consists of: two discs, also available separately, packaged together.

(1) The previously-released ""Dog Day Afternoon"" BD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dog-Day-Afternoon-Blu-ray/dp/B000NOKJEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dog Day Afternoon [Blu-ray</a>]

(2) The ""I Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale"" pre-order DVD (the 39-minute documentary must have been released earlier - there are reviews dating back to 2010):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Knew-It-Was-You-Rediscovering-John-Cazale/dp/B00ZVC2R0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale</a>",1442361600,11,843,8.141304347826088
7295426,5,B00ZVC2R5S,"I'm giving this 5 stars just to up the points given by the other pre~reviewer. Whether this is an optimal remaster or simply a repackage, it's an excellent film, and one of the very few to star the late, great John Cazale! And based on true events. If you're looking to build a classic film collection with major stars giving great performances, you really need this in your library. Al Pacino's performances are sadly all over the map, to the point of ridicule sometimes (Scent of a Woman; Hoo~wah!); so rest assured this A+ Pacino; comparable to the Godfather 1 & 2. John Cazales is in both of those films too; so now you have 3 movies to put at the top of your purchase list!",1442188800,,678,4.388888888888889
7295427,2,B00ZVC2R5S,"Dog Day afternoon an Al Pacino classic of course,
Brilliant Directing by Sydney Lumet, and of course brilliant acting by Al Pacino & John Cazale & Charles Durning
based on a True incident that happened in Brooklyn some years before the film was made

Warner bros first released this film on blu-ray back in 2007 which is the blu-ray version i have
the HD transfer looks very Good and sharp in 1:85:1 ratio so ofcourse better quality than the old dvd version
i can't say the same for the sound quality thou
WB did not give the film a new Master stereo mix instead only a 1.0 mono is given for this blu-ray version
which is shocking Audio quality, this classic film Deserves a new 1.0 stereo mix
Disgusting effort by Warner bros for the sound quality
but very fortunately that WB did carry over all the special feature from the 2 disc dvd set
all the extras have been carried over
the 4 part Doco making of Dog day afternoon plus a Vintage making of featurette from 1975
plus the DVD commentary by Sydney Lumet and Theatrical trailer

for the films 40th Anniversary WB have only recycled the content from the old 2007 blu-ray
which means same HD transfer & same 1.0 mono sound
which sounds pretty bad
with today's blu-ray technology a new master stereo mix can easily be added to the sound quality of this film, not Mono
but obviously Warner bros did not bother making the effort
with regards to the special features
all the extras from the 2007 blu-ray have been carried over to this new 2015 blu-ray
so there's nothing new there, however there is one new special feature WB have added
a tribute to Actor John Cazale who died way back in 1979 from terminal Lung cancer
it's a new featurette added for this new blu-ray may go for only 30mins or longer
apart from this new featurette, Warner bros just recycled the old 2007 blu-ray with new artwork and packaging
WB did not bother enhancing the sound quality at least with new 2015 HD transfer at least or new master audio stereo mix
very pathetic, it's tragic
there's some old 70's films given a new 4k HD transfer these days by Sony pictures, Ultra HD Higher than 1080p
the only Mainstream Distributor doing 4k remasters these days, warner bros & universal are still yet to catch up
and i tell you the picture quality looks incredible, no Grain no Dirt plus the sound quality is even better
so this film needs a new 4k remaster which would make the picture quality look incredible, no Grain no Dirt
if you want to see this new tribute featurette than buy the new 2015 reissue
otherwise it's exactly the same as the 2007 blu-ray just Different artwork
5 stars for the film, 1-2 stars for this new blu-ray reissue
based on extremely poor sound quality",1439337600,9,2698,4.504081632653061
