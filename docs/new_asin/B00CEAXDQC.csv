5718222,3,B00CEAXDQC,"It's a decent popcorn horror flick. Synopses can be found on other reviews. So here are the basics: It starts low-key... and remains fairly low-key throughout. The characters are stock but not bad. The setup is on the hackneyed side, as is the writing. That said, they kept it pretty simple, and so even though it's a movie you've pretty much seen before, it's not offensive. The acting is pretty good, which helps, because as mentioned earlier, the characters are stock and therefore don't grow on you. It's lower-budget fare, and so the director concentrated on atmosphere rather than gore, using gore effects sparingly but well. It's shot and edited well. Overall, it's a fairly tight little ""bug hunt"" slasher flick. I watched it all the way through, didn't fast-forward through any parts at all, and am not angry or bothered that I spent my time watching. It's an okay little movie, worth the price of viewing.",1423353600,3,915,4.834394904458598

I noticed a few people had rate it low..well to me this movie had almost everything in a better then good scary flick. The qestion is about the open ending it leaves... good to some... others hate it.  To me....it leaves it to your own  imagination to finish the plot.

5718227,1,B00CEAXDQC,"Lately I've rented a lot of cheap horror movies, such as this one, The Expelled. They all seem to run short of 90, even 80 minutes. Why? In the 80s at least the cheap B movies ran 90 minutes. As for this clunker, no one is expelled, that I know of, so not sure about the name except it's a lazy way to tie in to the school theme. My 5 year old nephew could be more clever! This movie is British, which may not be apparent from the description, so I hope you enjoy a British accent. There is no horror, just skinny kids in black masks killing people at a school. That's it. The alcoholic teacher, who hasn't shaved in a while, is the only somewhat interesting character.",1400457600,,669,4.153846153846154
5718228,2,B00CEAXDQC,"Robert Anderson (David Schofield) is a teacher who was not sensitive to a student and takes a hiatus. He returns having become obsessed with clipping articles about school violence and has developed a disdain for water, both the drinking and bathing varieties. While he is tending to his equally unlikable daughter Katlin (Eliza Bennett) in detention, some guys in hoodies and no faces come in and begin to scare and slice anyone they come across. Armed with a plumbing book, Robert is determined to save his daughter.

The film is short. You don't care for any of the characters, and wish they would all die horrible deaths. The movie is too low budget to show any type of violence, but would rather show you a bloody body. Mild tension.

This 2010 film is a 2014 Redbox rental that should remain in the box.

That's how I felt after 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is the most inconclusive movie I've ever seen. If you are willing to sacrifice time to watch a movie with no ending, go ahead.",1376265600,7,320,4.095238095238095
5718230,2,B00CEAXDQC,"I don't believe I have ever seen such a disjointed effort of a movie.  It begins innocently enough, with a father teaching an English class (also attended by his daughter).  He begins passing out previous test papers...accompanied by his caustic comments.  One young man takes exception about the remarks intended for him and punches the teacher in the face.  Forward to a school board hearing wherein the teacher realizes he is going to be railroaded and he storms out of the meeting.

The next scene is teacher looking like he's been rode hard and put up wet.  He's now a boozing, unclean, unshaven mess (who still teaches), but for some unexplained reasoning his daughter now despises him and he has no control of his classroom.  He finds out his daughter has chosen to accompany her boyfriend to a concert on her birthday instead of staying with daddy.  There is some sort of confrontation during class and father sends disrespectful daughter to detention.  I had no idea detention (in Britain) lasted until 8:30 p.m.  This is when the ""fun"" starts.

For whatever reason, the people inside the school--and they are NOT LOCKED IN as the advertisement would have you believe--find themselves suddenly terrorized by some people wearing hoodies.  These goons are very good at bashing in skulls and faces with fire extinguishers and doing messy things with crowbars.  Why?  You never find out.  Who are they?  You never find out.  There is no backstory to anything.  I would have at least liked to have known why dad became a complete basket case and why the security guards at this particular school did not have opposable thumbs.  Too bad for me, huh?

""The Expelled"" at one time must have SEEMED like a good idea to someone.  But all the viewer is innundated with are scenes of the bad guys dashing in the background behind their intended victims wreaking havoc.  No explanation is given for ANYTHING.  The viewer is asked to sit and watch (albeit for only 74 minutes) something that barely passes as a movie...and then it just ends.

I have seen very few movies that I would list as ""hating"" (as Amazon wants you to do).  However, I have seen MANY movies that are not as good as some community theater productions I've gone to.  Such is the case for ""The Expelled.""  The movie is rated ""R"" for language and violence.  I do not recommend wasting your time watching this completely disjointed attempt at a movie.",1374624000,8,2413,4.749397590361446
5718231,3,B00CEAXDQC,"What a rarity it is to find a new horror release that's produced such apathy that it can't even muster a customer review on Amazon... until now(cue the foreboding music).  Granted, the title ""Expelled"" and accompanying cover shot are both pretty bland(then again, there were two newer horror releases nearby, both under the EXACT same title of ""Home Sweet Home,"" so maybe this isn't all that uninspiring...), however it does feature some positive quotes from actual respectable sources(although, ""one of the all time best slasher films,"" this is not)rather than, ""I couldn't sleep for a week!""- Some Random Dude.  The movie starts with our main protagonist Robert(an outstanding David Schofield) being assaulted by a student while teaching.  Flash forward a year and he has allowed the incident to basically ruin his life.  Turning him into a shell of his former self, while costing him all professional respect he once had, as well as his family. While holding his own daughter after class for detention(awkward much?) a group of shadowy hooded figures begin a silent and brutal assault on the school and all those unlucky enough to still reside within.  They creep and crawl on top of lockers and bookshelves, silently cornering their prey when they feel the time is right, and showing no mercy when they do strike.  Much of the violence is implied, but when you do see the after effects it's clear that they are interested in making their victims suffer(for example, burning someone alive in a locked dumpster).  And that's basically it.  All these ingredients have been used before but director Johannes Roberts prepares a surprisingly effective concoction here that never wears out it's welcome(an air tight hour and twenty minutes).  The direction, acting, and musical score(felt underused even) are all very good!  I was so impressed in fact that I looked him up on IMDB... let's just say it appears he learned the hard way(though I do plan on giving ""Storage 24"" a look).  One major complaint that I could see some having is the open ended and ambiguous ending.  The killers are silent and faceless with no motive ever revealed.  I've always enjoyed that in my horror films... I mean, isn't it scarier when Michael Myers butchers his sister on Halloween night for no apparent reason(rather than because he grew up in a broken home with a stripper mom and abusive stepfather like in the Rob Zombie remake)?  But each to their own.  The Expelled is more than deserving of a viewing either way. (3.5 Stars)",1374019200,5,2511,4.931116389548694
8580811,1,B00CEAXDQC,"Not at all what I expected. I was hoping for a reason as to why the people that were terrorizing people were doing it, but they didn't give us one.",1493251200,,147,3.933333333333333
8580812,2,B00CEAXDQC,"I'm almost tempted to skip writing this review after seeing how many other Amazon reviewers were equally disappointed by this film. But I would like to add a few things that may not have been addressed. So here they are:

First off, this is a British film, with its own quirks typical to Brit flicks that many American viewers just don't get. As such, this doesn't follow the conventions of the usual slasher flick and instead spends an extra amount of time building up the characters and backstory beforehand. Let's look at what this movie has to offer.

Well-crafted characters with multiple layers and backstories: Yes
Good setting (a darkened school after hours) to add to the chills: Yes
Scary Villains: Yes
Tense suspense and moments of real horror: Yes
An ending: NOPE

The one thing that undoes this movie is that it never ends. By that I don't mean that it goes on forever. Rather, it builds to a point of taut suspense, bringing the viewer to a classic turning point that will define the main character and bring the action to a heart-pounding climax...and then it just stops. That's it, roll the credits, pick up your popcorn and go home.

The premise of the move is that we have a high school teacher who is frustrated with his life, drinks just to get himself into the classroom, and has devolved into the kind of hated instructor who enjoys humiliating his students in front of the classroom rather than actually helping them learn. When he provokes a kid who is having difficulty (to be fair, we don't know if the student is struggling or just gave no effort), the boy smacks the teacher right in the nose. This results in the teacher circulating flyers warning others of ""Violence In the Classroom"", as he can't pick up on the fact he's the only one inviting this kind of reaction. Nobody likes him. His wife, who actually seems to have her act together, has separated from him. Their daughter, who has the misfortune of being one of his students, wants nothing to do with him. He's petty enough that when he learns that his daughter wants to spend her birthday with her friends rather than with him, he gives her after-hours detention just so he can spend time with her. They end up seething in silence, but hey, he's so far gone he thinks it's better than nothing.

Enter the villains. In a darkened school, one of those places that seems innocuous and even welcoming in the light of day, is creepy as anything at night when doors are locked and its rooms and hallways are shrouded in darkness. A group of assailants--we are left to infer are students, as they have the build of teenagers--dressed in jeans, Chucks, and hoodies which cloak their faces in shadow. It's never clear if the large hoods alone are obscuring their faces or if they are each wearing black faceless Halloween masks, but their anonymity is a big part of what makes them so frightening. They move with cat-like agility, appear and vanish like ninjas, and have no compunction about killing anyone in their path. Teachers, coaches, principal, janitor, or students are all potential victims. The killers make due with whatever they have on hand; box cutters, a wrench, lighter fluid, and turn it into a deadly weapon. The kills are brutal and gruesome. It's often scarier when other people find the bodies and see the hideous state in which the victims have been left. The faceless assailants don't seem satisfied with just killing someone. They have to destroy them. Part of the chill factor is that you never know just how many of these hooded freaks there are. At one point there seems to be only one or two, maybe three. But in a particularly terrifying moment, a girl is cornered by three, then four, then five killers...and they just keep coming, crowding the room and blocking all means of escape. You can't help but ask, ""How many of them ARE there?!""

The movie does include the classic tropes we've come to expect from a slasher. The security guard who just doesn't care about his jobs and is basically a moron. ""Oh, I'm sure that scrawled warning of YOU'RE DEAD on the window was just some silly prank. Or maybe the wind. Or a passing squirrel. No, I won't go check it out."" The cops sent to the scene are as sharp as lobotomy patients and ill-equipped to handle the situation. One of them wastes time scolding a clearly terrified staffer for his agitated state when said staffer is trying to warn the cop to turn around to see the approaching killer. Help isn't coming, there's no way out, we have no real idea of what we're up against, everything is scary, and we're on our own. Let the fun begin!

And that's where it stops. There is tremendous buildup and then nothing. I can see the point in reaching a defining moment for the main character  and using his final decision to take us to the movie's conclusion. Okay, fine. But not with the other 99% of the movie unresolved!!! Who were the bad guys, really? The movie is called ""The Expelled""--so were they all angry students who got the shaft? Kids who were humiliated and discarded like the boy in the main character's classroom who'd finally had enough and come back for revenge? If so, why does that grant them the ability to move about like shadow demons and avoid all detection until they pounce? If they are so bent on wreaking havoc and mayhem, why come to the school late at night when it's practically empty? Were they targeting the jerk teacher specifically? If that was the case, why slaughter anyone with a pulse, deserving of retribution or not? Couldn't they just nab the guy and make off with him to torture to death at their leisure? At one point, when one of the attackers is downed--the only time that happens, by the way--there is a chance to rip his blasted hood off and see who he is. What an ideal moment to see the freshly-scrubbed face of what appears to be just some kid, and feel your blood curdle at the thought any teen could be capable of such horrors. But someone else nearby is wounded and is tended to instead, so we don't even get that bit of satisfaction. Gah!

If you like watching 2/3 of a movie and then walking out, this is the thriller for you. Good acting, strong setup, creepy locale, and truly terrifying villains, with absolutely no answers or conclusion. It's one thing to sit through a graphic thriller and be disappointed by the ending. But that's still better than finding there's no ending at all.",1476489600,,6399,4.596322241681261
8580813,4,B00CEAXDQC,"This movie isn't for everyone. A bit slow in the beginning, it does try to set up the story. The acting is good. Not a lot of gore as most of the killings take place off screen but you see the aftermath. Practical effects not crappy CGI. It does leave some unanswered questions and not everyone will like the ending. I enjoyed this movie and think it's worth watching.",1473811200,,368,4.3478260869565215
8580814,1,B00CEAXDQC,"For those of you who enjoy pure slasher movies with no rationale, no motive, and no identifiable killer(s), this one's for you. For anyone else, avoid this movie as you would a building known to be populated with relentless slashers. Or, better yet, go see the umpteenth version of Friday the 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare on Elm Street. The story, if you can call it that, revolves around a high school teacher who is put on suspension for verbally abusing a male student in front of his class because of a poor performance on an essay test. The teacher returns 11 months later. The class appears to be made up of the same students, one of which is his daughter.  Additionally, we are never made aware of any other classes in this high school.  It merely exists as the setting  for the carnage to come when some hooded individuals (we never see their faces and they are never identified) suddenly appear out of the blue and kill anyone they come upon in the most horrific way. Since new names can be seen next to the ""hooded
killers"" in the credits apart from any characters we have seen in the film, they remain anonymous to the end and beyond. How they get into the school building which has two guards (one of whom is such a wimpy moron that he couldn't guard a dog house) is never explained; and while the credits reveal that there were three of them, I was sure that I once counted five. But who knows? And what difference does it make? This film has ridiculous continuity. Aside from all the blood letting, the rest of the time we see our newly restored teacher running throughout the school looking for his daughter in order to save her. (I wish that somebody had been looking
for me to save me from this movie.) When two police officers finally do show up - one male and one female - they are quickly dispatched by our killers showing that the cops were as incompetent and ineffectual as the earlier mentioned guard.  I don't wish to be a spoiler regarding the ""grand finale"" so the only thing else I will say is: 1) Either there was a planned sequel (?!) that never came about;  2) The film makers ran out of film; or 3) the film makers didn't even know what their own movie was about and left it at that.",1463184000,,2215,4.392682926829268
8580815,3,B00CEAXDQC,"Without giving anything specific away, promise, this is a well-done little movie with a- at best- highly debatable ending. While there's nothing here that hasn't been done before, there's a lot to like and admire, at least I thought so. First of all, the focus is NOT on the high school students and the ones we see are or at least look like they are actually played by TEENAGERS. Not twenty-somethings with receding hairlines and clear skin. The build-up of tension is quite well-done. Sure, there are the usual questions about why these people don't leave a few more lights on but it's not as glaring as in other horror films. The antagonists are effective, even though the lack of motive isn't given some sort of context OR some sort of clear reason for there to BE no context and for the whole thing to be senseless. The gore is brief yet superb. It is brutal and disturbing for good reason. The off-screen deaths are equally as disturbing and balance things out. The actors are almost entirely quite good and the characters mostly behave in believable ways, especially when they cave in when faced with hopeless odds. This might not satisfy fans who want characters to make wisecracks and smash skulls in but I prefer things a bit more realistic than that. The ending, which I won't describe, just felt abrupt without a good reason. I could BEGIN to see a reason, but, it made the entire thing feel like a relatively feature-length quality movie which suddenly becomes a television drama. The believability was there, but, the pay off for the viewer just wasn't, and there didn't seem to be a clear reason for it. Up until then, though, I thought it was quite well-done and tense.",1460332800,,1685,4.6767676767676765
8580816,1,B00CEAXDQC,"It's about a British teacher named Robert Anderson, who as he's teaching a class, he soon hands graded papers to all the students.  He decides to be abrasive with one of the students besides giving him an ""F'.  The student doesn't take kindly to that at all and takes to pummeling Robert in front of the whole class; including his daughter.  During his school board meeting, Robert finds out that nothing going to happen to the student that hit him as the student's parents are threatening to sue the school board for the emotional anguish brought about by humiliating him in front of his fellow classmates.  So Robert still teaches even as he's become a drunken wreck and somehow never seems to run into that angry student again.  He serves his daughter with detention to keep her from being with her boyfriend and allow them some time together.  For some reason(never explained) he and his wife are divorced and his daughter really hates him.  Cutting to the chase, soon a group of hoods wearing hoodies lol, invade the school with their faces all masked.  As they do throw things at the school, their completely worthless douchebag guard James, chooses to do absolutely nothing about it.  These punks move around unnoticed and climb on things as if they're monkeys.  They have plenty of weapons in their arsenals also.

This movie is just flat, dry, and boring.  It takes too friggin' long before they start their assault and when they do it doesn't amount to anything much.  This movie just moves far too slow and doesn't give much pay off in the end.  The gore is minimal and looks too fake, there's no nudity or sex, there's no humor, most of the murders are off camera, none of the kill scenes are cool as they aren't done with any real style, the characters are all dull and the except the only likable character is the librarian; whereas the rest are unlikable and I couldn't have cared less about any of them.  There's no character development.  In fact the plot isn't especially developed either.  Who the hell are those killers anyway?  Not only is that never explained nor is it ever explained why they're killing people in the first place.  You assume that they're angry students trying to make the teachers pay for flunking them.  Maybe rejected students out to kill the cool kids and whomever else they care to.  But it doesn't matter because you'll never know.  They're kept a total mystery as if that was even remotely a good idea for the plot.  The only cool thing about this movie is the camera work showing the environment.  Unfortunately there wasn't very much of that.  The movie still would've sucked but, at least some style could've come from it.  The ending offers no closure of any kind it just ends when the movie needed a proper ending.

In closing, this movie is just too slow and plodding, boring, pointless, had lame and mostly unlikable characters, too many off camera kills, laughably bad gore, crappy acting, it wasn't scary since it was predictable, the killers remain a mystery, 75 minutes couldn't have possibly moved any slower, there's no comic relief, the back of the artwork lies by claiming that the hooded killers are ""vigilantes"".  That's a lie and apparently they don't know what that word means.  in general this movie just offers nothing to merit.  Either rent it or better yet skip it all together.  Don't make the mistake I made by buying it blindly.",1448323200,,3401,4.694256756756757

This one just isn't good.  Period.

The hero is a bad teacher, who, at the beginning, gets head butted by a student because he was being a dick.  Then the hero becomes a worse teacher, bad father, bad husband and a drunk.  And still teaches.  (I am a teacher, but tenure IS NOT that good!)

Then one night after school all hell breaks loose.  A group of faceless, Ninja murderers show up.  And they kill whoever they can find.  And it's just lucky for them that the teachers work late, well into the night... (or work out in skimpy shorts and a sports bra).

And then the end.....  Not even closure.  Who are the Ninjas?  Why?  What were they after?  We never find out... Unless there is The Expelled II...
