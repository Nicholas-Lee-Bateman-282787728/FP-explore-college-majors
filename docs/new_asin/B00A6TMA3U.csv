This is great because it allows you to concentrate on your form and positioning. If you don't have a lot of free time, this is the workout for you. If you don't have them, you should consider getting a yoga mat and 3 and 5 lbs. hand weights.",1370995200,3,381,4.232876712328767

5384781,5,B00A6TMA3U,"I have been working out fairly regularly for several years now, but decided to try Harley's 5 factor workout and am so glad I did!  This is a totally do-able routine which gets real results.  You start out with 5 minutes of basic warm-up every day (a couple of circuits of jogging/running, jumping jacks, and crossed knee lifts).  By the end of this, you are breathing heavy and beginning to sweat!  Then you move on to one of 5 routines (do a new one each day for 5 days a week).  Each routine consists of 3 strength moves done in 3 circuits of 25 reps each using various strength/weight moves--most (but not all) with dumbbells.  These are old-school effective moves like squats, lunges, crunches, and various lifts/curls/extensions.  They are spread out throughout the week in such a way that you are hitting all of your muscle groups without getting overworked or needing time off to rest.  Your 3 strength circuits are then followed by high intensity cardio for 5-7 minutes (similar moves as the warmup but also including things like speed skating, mountain climbing, boxing, and jump roping).

I have seen a real change in my physique after less than 8 weeks, as well as a drop in my %body fat, I think the regular use of weights makes a real difference.  This is a workout I can stick with, I feel great after a workout--tired and worked, but not in a way that impedes my progress.  I especially like that the moves are really basic--that allows me to focus on the task at hand and my form and intensity.  I hate DVDs that are heavily dance-based and leave me standing there just trying to figure out the moves and always several steps behind.

Harley is not the most ""touchy feely"" cheerleading-type trainer--in fact he actually says something like ""if you're tired, guess what, I DON'T CARE!"" and ""no resting, there's no rest for the wicked!""  It doesn't bother me too much though.  I bought several other workout DVDs at the same time as this one, and haven't yet felt the need to try the others, so I guess that says something.",1456790400,2,2038,4.5911602209944755

5384801,5,B00A6TMA3U,"This is an excellent work out DVD and works well for both home and travel.
I am a gym rat, I work out each day mixing up weights / cardio, swimming and yoga; but this Thanksgiving we were out of town staying with family and I still wanted to get a daily workout in that would be easy to accomplish and not take too much time out of my day - this fit the bill!
It begins with a warm up, followed by a choice of 5 different workouts, one for each weekday, that rotate through different muscles so by the end of the week you have worked each body part. Then there is a cool down! This is short, about 30 minutes from start to finish, so if you wanted more, you could do two or more of the routines together - it is your choice how to customize!
Harley uses basic old school exercises - crunches, curls, side bends, jogging and on the first workout I thought ""wow, this is super easy""....that was until the next morning when my muscles ached! As stated before , I work out a lot so thought this was a breeze until I felt those muscles and realized that this old school movements are really effective in toning and strengthening key muscles groups! I should note that he gives the option to use weights and I used 8lb dumbbells.
Harley keeps it simple, explains the moves well and had various options for different levels. There is no crazy background or music, its low key, simple and easy to both follow and most importantly get form correct!
The only downside I can see is this might get a bit repetitive! There is one warm up and one cool down and though it does add or remove an exercise each day, it might get old fast, but there again, you could also master this quickly. Now I use some of these exercises in my gym routine.
This is a great, simple workout DVD that works, plain and simple! I came home from that Thanksgiving trip surprised to be a couple of pounds lighter , despite not planning nor needing  it and credit this DVD for that!",1417824000,11,1944,4.2398921832884096

5384819,4,B00A6TMA3U,"When I first started this program I didn't like it at all. I actually hated it. I've done many of Jillian michaels workouts and others such as 10 lb slim down which have similar style to this one (circuit work) and I felt that I wasn't getting a good workout because I wasn't constantly running around and killing myself for the whole 20 minutes in this video BUT a week into it I've actually grown to like it!  I do supplement with going to the gym and doing extra cardio and some weights there a few days a week, but I like that I can do this video alone and feel results or I can still get to the gym if I'm feeling extra motivated to do so since I'm not completely dead after doing the video. All in all I think that this is worth the money and worth it to use whether you are just looking to tone up a bit and still feel like you're getting a solid work out in or using it to add to an existing regimen.",1404259200,3,908,3.9617486338797816

The exercises are simple and straight-forward. These workouts may seem ""easy"" while you're doing them, but the next day your body is sore. These workouts prove that you don't have to jump all over the place and risk injuring yourself in order to get a good workout. Harley's philosophy is simple and it works for me. I felt great after just one week! I do one of the 5-factor workouts in the morning and do one of Jessica Smith's walking workouts in the evening.

It's not the toughest workout I've ever done, but sometimes that's just what I need -- to exercise without feeling like I'm punishing myself.  I alternate all my dvd workouts with 2 - 3 mile runs.

5384824,5,B00A6TMA3U,"I love Harley's workout. I was skeptical at first because of other reviews, but I enjoy this workout, as much as one can enjoy an intense cardio session. You have a warm up and a cool down in addition to the exercises. You have five days of different exercises, and there doesn't seem to be a progression of things getting harder, but rather targeting different areas of the body. The workout is quick, but that means the moves are harder and you have to transition quickly. It also means you have to get the movements down, and perform them as best as you can and go as hard as you can so to speak. The girls in the background are kind of obnoxious with their constant smiles, but that's like any workout video. I ignore them. Harley demonstrates everything well and talks you through the exercises and if you're feeling something in the wrong place you're doing them incorrectly. The only annoying thing that Harley has done is give a comment during the ""sprinting"" where he said, ""pretend you're running home to get that chocolate chip cookie,"" and then, ""oh no you didn't get that chocolate chip cookie because we have to keep going!"" I almost died laughing it was such a ridiculous comment. Oh well, I can overlook one dumb comment as long as I am getting a good workout, which I do break quite a sweat when I do this cardio. I'm also not out of shape and I workout throughout the week going to yoga and pilates and other things. Enjoyable and a great way to start your morning!",1390003200,4,1483,4.455882352941177

5384827,5,B00A6TMA3U,"I am one of those people who love the idea of work out videos and own many but never seem to stick with them past a couple of weeks.  I think I have finally found something that I will stick with.  So far, I am going on month three and still use this video work out.  The exercises are basic but totally effective.  At first, it's kind've hard to just do the 3 main exercises for the day b/c you feel the need to work out more but when you add in the cardio in the beginning and end, you realize it's enough.  You also definitely feel the work out days later.  I've seen almost immediate results and love the way my body is changing and getting stronger.  I think also the idea of a smaller time commitment to the workout is what keeps me on track b/c it's not so daunting.  You know it 's only going to be 15-25 mins (depending on if you add in the cardio) and you are still going to see results.  It's a motivator.  Now, my confession...I don't do all 5 days in a week due to schedule.  (I'm a 45yr old mom of two and have a full time job outside the home) I cheat as well by skipping the end cardio more than 1/2 the time.  I am still seeing results.  :)  My goal is to continue with the workout.... forever....and sometime within the next 3 months I will be on track with 5 days a week, including the cardio.  tidbit...I find myself doing some of the exercises and cardio moves during the day when I have a few minutes to kill ...wherever, in the kitchen...at work...at the soccer field.  I would recommend this video for someone who likes dumb bells and is in a time crunch.  I also purchased Harley's Body Reset Diet and now start every morning with an Apple Pie Smoothie and sometimes substitute the Sweet Spinache Smoothie for dinner.  I am not weighing myself as I find the scale discouraging.  I am just going by how my clothes fit, how I feel and look overall.  It's improving.  Little by little.  Good luck.",1386892800,52,1919,4.2

At first it seemed kind of easy, compared to some of the other 30 minute workouts I've been doing (30 Day Shred/Ripped in 30) but I was very sore after day 1 so I know it was effective.  This was achieved through what felt like a gentler workout than those other 30 minute DVDs.  I am not a coordinated person, which is why I like to workout at home, so I loved when Harley mentioned he is a not a choreographer and found his exercises to be simple to do but efficient.

8547123,3,B00A6TMA3U,"PROs: Works every major muscle group at least once (and shoulders twice) throughout the week.  Includes a warm-up and a little cardio every day.  Harley takes the time to explain each move to ensure proper form and safety.  Doesn't take much time and doesn't require any equipment beyond a set of weights.  Great for someone (like me) who is getting back into shape after taking an entire month off from working out.  The two women who join Harley on the DVD demonstrate modifications.
CONs: The warm up gets the job done but is really boring.  Per his suggestion, I've replaced it with another 5-minute warm-up that I do on my own.  Cardio is fine for someone who isn't in good shape or for someone who does additional cardio on their own.  If you're in decent shape, it won't be enough for you.  No cool down or stretching.  The background music is awful---like the automatic rhythms that are on a keyboard.  Harley claims that he's trained celebrities like Halle Barry and that they only work out for 25 minutes/day 5 days/week and follow his 5-Factor Diet Plan.  Don't expect a body like Halle's on this amount of exercise.  I just don't believe that anyone with a Hollywood Body is achieving it with 25 minutes/week of moderate exercise.
Not really a pro or con: After doing the workouts for 5 weeks, you'll be bored and ready to move on to something else.  Fortunately, you'll also be in good enough shape to move on to something more challenging!",1489708800,4,1453,4.647058823529412
8547124,5,B00A6TMA3U,"Better than the books!
With this Dvd you don't need a bench or ball. Just dumbells, and a mat if you don't have carpet. I got my mat from Walmart and it works just fine.
I like this way better because I can do it anywhere, in a hotel or on vacation, etc.
People who don't see results need to add 20-30 minutes of cardio, like on a treadmill or stationary bike, if you are losing a lot of weight. Harley says in one of his books that he tells his clients to do this if there's a lot of weight to come off. But his exercises are enough if you just need to get in shape and tone. Don't overdo it.

I have tried Harleys diet plan in the past but it was too hard for me. But I did take away his philosphy of making sure to always combine protein, carb, fiber, and water to drink, with every meal. So I combine this with the old Weight Watchers Points Plus (the one before Oprah took over and ruined it), and Nourishing Traditions type food for my immune system. Just keep with your points, while eating whole foods combined in Harleys way.

Also I don't feel as tired after the dvd workout, like I did with the one in the book. Not sure if the dvd is just more fun and motivating, or what. But I love it.
I have chronic pain and illness, and this is the workout I come back to. Low impact, but with all the benefits of crossfit style. And its only 25 minutes. I can do that.

Got through 3 workouts and the DVD just stopped working; no matter what program I try to open it in, it just wouldn't open. Then, today, I try to open it again and I get a message there are no files on this DVD...Great! :(",1466899200,,297,3.966666666666667
