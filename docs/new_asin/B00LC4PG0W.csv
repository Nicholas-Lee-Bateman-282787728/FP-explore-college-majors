6479464,3,B00LC4PG0W,"This is why they stopped making gangster movies! BLOODY MAMA is a fair retelling of the infamous Ma Baker and her boys also known
to history as the BLOODY BARKERS. But I also grew up watching AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES--Worth watching if your a historian--my personal favorites abouth the bank robbers on the 1930s: PRETTY BOY FLOYD, A BULLET FOR PRETTY BOY, THE STORY OF PRETTY BOY FLOYD and DILLINGER WITH WARREN OATES or get the Gat (The Thompson).",1426377600,,456,4.858974358974359

8665120,3,B00LC4PG0W,"You have to hand it to Shelley Winters, when she gets her teeth into a part, she's like JAWS.  ""Bloody Mama,"" directed by the indefatigable Roger Corman, has a rampant Shelley as Kate Barker leading her four wayward boys down from the hills of Arkansas to rob, rape, and pillage in the towns of the Great Depression times.  The talented cast includes Don Stroud as the sullen, violent Herman, Robert De Niro as the dopey junkie Lloyd, and Bruce Dern as the cruel hanger-on Kevin.  Diane Varsi is everybody's moll.  Also seen are veterans Pat Hingle as a gutsy rich man whom the gang kidnaps for big bucks, and Scatman Crothers as a mistreated caretaker.  The movie is purposefully sleazy, the most depraved telling of the Barker story that I have seen.  Corman directs the action sequences in his usual efficient style, but the dramatic scenes often slow the movie down with bogus psychology.  Not pleasant is the use of a real piglet dragged from a boat to bait a fake alligator.  Expected climactic shoot-out should satisfy the bloodthirsty, especially the Thompson gun blast inches from the face.  Generally, it's a watchable but not high quality gangster opus.",1526083200,,1164,4.838383838383838

8665128,4,B00LC4PG0W,"I've thought of Ma Barker and her boys periodically since its original release and feel lucky to see it available again.
First off you get Shelley Winters, several good character actors, and a few, like DeNiro and Dern who became famous later.

Second, the movie is socially still decades ahead of our CSI SVU, with Robert Walden as a masochist, cellmate Bruce Dern as his sadistic top, and incest implied between Ma and the boys. Not pretty topics but here presented as motivations rather than sensationalism.

Third, it never falls into camp as, for instance, ""Baby Jane"" does, nor does it invite mockery, being a couple notches above the drive-in fare it could've been, because its rambunctious mayhem is a product of the freedom accorded to movies back then, before studio greed crushed creativity under the timid formula of its blockbusters. Consider that the plot actually casts stories for each of the boys, instead of relying on serial CGI thrill bonding. It's as worth watching as ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" even though less artistic, if only to enjoy what movies were when audiences valued originality and the intoxication of possibility over bombast and familiarity.

Don't get me wrong. I love ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and expect to enjoy ""Deadpool,"" but the occasional burger is delicious after a conveyor belt of raw steak.",1456444800,4,1331,5.013574660633484
8665129,1,B00LC4PG0W,"Save your money.  The best part of ""Bloody Mama"" was the movie poster.  Shelley Winters gave some brilliant performances...but this is not one of them.  This film was shot on a shoestring budget. The vintage cars and chase scenes are fine.  However, there is no coherent script.  Robert DeNiro shines in his role as the dope addict son. Shelley hams it up shamelessly as Ma Barker.  The Academy should have asked for one of her Oscars back after this fiasco.  Shelley did a series of 3 cheapo films for American International ""Whatever Happened to Helen"", ""Bloody Mama"" and ""Who Slew Auntie Roo"" in the early 1970's. That body of work should have gotten her expelled from ""The Actor's Studio"". She is heavy in this picture.  However, three years later, in The Poisiden Adventure"" she will be big enough to sink an ocean liner all by herself.  As Ma Barker Shelley wears about 5 ratty looking wigs from blonde to auburn, short to long, and back again with no explanation.  Shelley also wears about two pairs of false eyelashes as Ma. Save your money or just rent or borrow this loser.",1439424000,5,1083,4.652631578947369
