173440,5,0967425603,"This video is the fourth in my library of aero/kick boxing fitness videos, and is very quickly becoming my favorite!  It is extremely challenging at first, but if you have some experience and are serious about mastering the movements, you quickly become comfortable with the moves and can master the  techniques.  I am now working out four days a week doing aero and  kickboxing and have noticed a TREMENDOUS change in my body AND my mind.  I  feel strong and confident, yet feel enlightened enough to stay humble and  quietly stable.  I rest every other day, with only two of my workout days  being back to back and I feel incredibly strong and look lean and sexy in  all of my clothes.  I'm 33 and can wear all of the sexy and cute fashions  out on the market!  My husband is VERY happy with my new workout and loves  to watch every now and again.  He is awed by the strength and agility I've  developed since doing this workout alone.  It has improved my form for my  other three workout tapes.  I love this workout and recommend it to  EVERYONE who is SERIOUS about keeping fit both physically AND emotionally.",942019200,15,1114,4.475
7794008,5,0967425603,"I produced this back in 1999 (I think).  Little story.  I wanted to find something that was close to ""Dewey"" to name the product/work out and when I checked what was closest with a Chinese Linguist - it was Dawei and it supposedly, serendipitously, translated to ""Awesomeness"".  Can't believe this is still on Amazon!",1441065600,,317,4.833333333333333
7794009,5,0967425603,"If you have a lot of kickboxing experience this could be a great video. He does not do any verbal cues, so it takes a couple of run throughs before you have the workout down. It is strenuous, short (about 40 minutes), and high impact. I love the workout, and it is in my regular rotation. It is hard to find good kickboxing videos, most are ludicrously easy and annoying. If you are a big fan of Tae Bo, or of Janis Saffel, then you probably won't like Dawei. If you are looking for a hardcore, nonstop kickfest, this may be your ticket. He doesn't do much of a cooldown before he starts stretching, so you may want to cooldown on your own, then come back for the stretching.",1169164800,,675,4.24031007751938
7794010,5,0967425603,"I have never work a sweat like this in a long time, ive been doing kickboxing at home for about 7 years, i have hundreds of tapes and always looking for more, ive bought a few from amazon some good some bad, so i kept reading the reviews on this tape so i figure why not, Well its different, no talking and he saids that, your really not so much into the music because your consentrating on him i felt like i was in his class at the privacy of my home, sweat, let me tell you i had to change my shirt, not for beginners, i highly recommend this tape,if you want something different

7794011,5,0967425603,"THIS IS A TRUE KICKBOXING WORKOUT.  IT HAS EXCELLENT CHOREOGRAPHY.  THE MOVES TIE IN PERFECTLY WITH THE MUSIC.  THIS VIDEO LEAVES ME FEELING LIKE A CHINA DOLL!  I WORKOUT, SHOWER, THEN GET REALLY PRETTY FOR MY 9 TO 5.  INSIDE I HAVE A SENSE STRENGTH AND POWER!  OUTSIDE I AM THE PICTURE OF ELEGANCE AND GRACE.  EVERY WORKOUT I COMPLETE LEAVES ME IN AWE!  THE MUSIC ALONE SETS THE STAGE FOR A SERIOUS WORKOUT.  IT WAS TAPED IN 1999 I WISH I HAD FOUND IT THEN, ALTHOUGH I AM SURE THAT MY TWO AND ONE-HALF YEARS OF TAEBO HAS HELPED MY ABILITY TO COMPLETE THIS WORKOUT IN NEAR EXCELLENT FORM! SO I GIVE MUCH RESPECT TO TAEBO BUT THIS VIDEO IS THE ONE I USE TO FEEL LIKE A FEMALE NINJA TWO TIMES PER WEEK!!  IGNORE ALL NEGATIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT THIS VIDEO.  IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT KICKBOXING, THERE IS NO COMPARISON TO DAWEI YET PRODUCED.",1040860800,,835,4.288461538461538
7794012,5,0967425603,"This tape is NOT for beginners, or anyone who wants a lot of talking, cueing, slow-motion or explanation.  It's hard-core kickboxing, and Dewey Yung expects you to already know the moves, how to kick and punch, the proper form, etc.  So if you don't know these things, this tape isn't for you.  But if you're a kickboxing workout veteran, this should really get you going.  The combinations are fast and relatively complex (at least compared to Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout and Tae Bo)- I can't keep up with them half of the time, but I just started this workout.  You have to build up to it, at your own pace.  Guaranteed to make you sweat like a pig :",986774400,5,657,4.4789915966386555
7794013,3,0967425603,This video was a disappointment. I would not call it cardio kickboxing. It was more learning punches and kicks and proper technique wasn't even used. If you are looking for a video that will keep your interest and give you an excellent workout then this video is NOT the one for you. I have been in an aerobic kickboxing class and had a much better workout than this tape offered.,983232000,,380,4.442857142857143
7794014,5,0967425603,"I have been kickboxing for about 5 years and this is the tape I have been waiting for!  It's perfect for kickboxing enthusiasts.  The only tapes I have found that come close are those from Ciavideo.com.  A word of warning, this is not for the faint of heart.  You must have kickboxing experience and an advanced exerciser for this tape.  Beginners should not even attempt it.  He gives no verbal instruction at all during the tape so you need to have prior knowledge before trying this tape.  But for the advanced level kickboxers out there you MUST have this tape!",973900800,3,565,4.59
7794015,3,0967425603,"I was little disappointed with this one. I need to teach  kickboxing at the gym. I wanted to know how to kick, what is important to kick, and more basic information about jab,cross, hook,upper. He never talked about that. He was just moving. I know this is for advanced people. but we need to know basic movement or we will hurt our body, I think.
If you practice at home, you can sweat a lot.",972691200,,393,4.24
7794016,4,0967425603,"I love this new form of workout!  I have been doing taebo for 3 years now and have even been in the new live! series videos and thought I was in tip top shape well let me tell you ..... This video completely blew me away.  I  love this new approach, 45 minutes with this guy is like 2 hours of any  other kickboxing.  This is great, I can already see my body changing  again(more lean muscle mass) and I didn't think it was possible.  I  recommend it for anyone that is on the intermediate to advanced level.  Beginners this in not for you but anyone can work up to this level and do  it!  Great video and instruction.",946944000,8,618,4.109243697478991
