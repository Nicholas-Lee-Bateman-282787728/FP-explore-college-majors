8206426,5,B000SQJ2DM,I loved the book and opera so I watched this ballet. It is wonderful... the best of the best.,1487808000,,93,3.9473684210526314
8206427,2,B000SQJ2DM,"First of all I assume this ballet score was intended as a legitimate artistic endeavor, rather than a comedy.  Part of me still wonders if I have been taken in by a spoof.  It starts with the very first frame.  We know Traviata is based on Dumas' ""La Dame aux Camlias"".  So the Russian title card gives this ballet's English title as ""Dame with Camellias"" [sic!]  Sounds like a Three Stooges sendup, don't you think?

But alas, I believe it is intended as serious, so let's take a little walk-thru.  First we note the sound and picture are not very good.  It is a DVD mastered from a videocassette.  And you know how so many classical DVD's start with the producer's logo and jingle which is super loud and obnoxious?  Well, this is the loudest and most obnoxious of them all.  Aside from that, from a sound and picture standpoint, the DVD is not very satisfying.  But ... a great artistic performance could make that inconsequential.

So let us discuss the music.  Anything Stokowski did with Bach pales in angel-white comparison to the arrangement done here.  It's like the 101 Strings on steroids.  A few pieces such as the Overture sound more or less traditional, just to get us started I suppose.  Then the orchestrator/arranger begins tweaking, fixing, re-orchestrating, adding counter-melodies until it's barely recognizable.

I will give you a couple of examples.  On the mild end of revisions, he takes almost every V chord and makes it a V7.  That adds drama, I suppose.  And if it was already a V7, he turns into a ii dim 7.  That adds color.  It's as if he knows a few Italian cliches, but with no concept of restraint or finesse, just spraypainting the cliches everywhere.

Another example:  in the Libiam, Verdi's basic oom-pah-pah is a simple 1-3-3, 1-3-3, 1-3-3, 1-3-3.  But our arranger knows better than Verdi, so he updates it to 1-3-3, 5-3-3, 1-3-3, 5-3-3.  Not only is that not what Verdi wrote, it also clashes with the melody, of which he seems blissfully unaware.

At the other extreme is music that has been almost completely recomposed, with a melody or two somewhat reminiscent of the source material.  Quite a few times the orchestra starts and one says, ""Oh! something original, not from Traviata"" ... and a minute or two later, ""Oh, I see, that's the card-playing music (or whatever), played about quarter tempo.""

Now about the performance.  There is no orchestra in sight--the score was obviously pre-recorded and played back on loudspeakers while the dancers dance.  I have always felt that is a cheesy way to do ballet, but hey.  More annoying is that throughout the score, if the action of a scene was completed before the musical phrase is done, they just fade out the music and start abruptly with the next track :(

The production does have one redeeming factor.  I don't think I'll ever complain about a ""regie-theater"" Traviata again.  Anything is a masterpiece after this arrangement.

Considering everything as a whole, $35 is not only expensive, it's obscene.  I paid it because I thought Russian ballet was the best in the world.  I won't be fooled again.  I give two stars rather than one because--I don't know, the dancing ""may"" be competent.",1411603200,,3188,4.756855575868373
8206428,2,B000SQJ2DM,"I love the music of Verdi, and La Traviata is a favourite. I'd have thought the wonderfully flowing melodies (not to mention this very melodramatic story) would make tailor-made for ballet. It was neither. What a wasted opportunity.",1354060800,,232,5.131578947368421
8206429,5,B000SQJ2DM,"Thank you Moscow Classical Ballet for La Traviata - a delightful romantic ballet. One that I feel deserves a larger audience.

It uses music from Verdi's opera, but tells its own variation of Dumas' Lady of the Camellias. A bitter sweet version; not as intensely emotional as Neumeier's Kameliendame (Amazon B000OFOSOA), and much more interesting than the Ashton version (Amazon B000189L0G).

The quality of the sound recording is not that great but I think that good use has been made of Verdi's music.  I particularly like a sequence with music taken from the end of Act 1 of the opera where Violetta wonders if Alfredo is the one for her (Ah fors'e lui) and then rejects this idea as madness declaring that she must spend a loveless life devoted to frivolity (Sempre libera),  In the ballet these pieces become a tender pas de deux between Marguerite and Armand and then a dramatic sequence where Marguerite, feeling that she is a courtesan with no right to love, attempts to drive Armand away.  Her frenzy spent the couple reunite in another gentle pas de deux.

Intensely romantic.",1290729600,3,1086,4.8432432432432435
