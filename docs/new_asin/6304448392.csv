886005,5,6304448392,"Majestic images of Yosemite, serene music, calming narration:  with these tools Rodney Yee presents five sessions aimed at preparing the individual for meditation by offering practice in breath awareness, posture, position,  and flexibility to assume meditative poses.  The last session is a guided  meditation.  Although the video lists seven props necessary to the video,  only three are used:  a chair, two blankets, and a block, and the last two  are optional depending on your flexibility.  MOUNTAIN offers a  transition from standing activity to the floor, starting with mountain  pose, then flowing through standing forward bend to downward dog to the  ground.  GARDEN presents chair exercises that stretch the inner thighs and  groin in preparation for the seated meditative poses shown in TREE.  In  TREE, Rodney demonstrates four traditional meditative poses--cobbler,  lotus, sage, and hero, including the use of blocks and blankets to make the  asanas more comfortable.  WIND is a session in supine focusing on the  breath, and SKY is eight minutes of meditation guided by Rodney.  I  found the video relaxing and peaceful.  Most poses are easy and well within  the scope of a beginner, although GARDEN may prove challenging for  individuals without much flexibility in the hips.  Even if much of the  video is not meditation per se, it still affords an opportunity to quiet  mental chatter and relax the body.  For me, this tape *is* Yoga for  Relaxation!",963792000,95,1468,5.229437229437229
886006,4,6304448392,Rodney Yee is one of the best professional Yoga teachers out there today doing videos.  He knows his stuff.

886109,2,6304448392,"this dvd is ok if you've never done meditation before, and even then it's not exactly helpful. i guess i thought it would have some guided meditations within, rather than just preparations for poses. also, there's an exact section copied from another rodney yee meditation dvd (am and pm meditation, which i recommend highly) and i feel like that's kind of a rip-off. but, you know, nice scenery and rodney's never bad to look at, haha.",1385337600,6,436,4.75

886111,3,6304448392,"I don't like how short these are and how they skip from one to the other without you touching anything. I'd just be getting into a relaxed state, and then have to reach over and stop the video from progressing. Not a big fan. The scenery in the videos is pretty nice, though.",1360368000,2,275,4.2075471698113205
886112,5,6304448392,"At 58, I'm not trying to push the yoga envelope, merely stay limber, healthy and focused. I have found that an hour with Rodney every morning and walking two miles a day give me exactly what I need to achieve my goals.  His gentle manner and backdrops are pleasing, plus he's definitely not hard on the eyes.",1298678400,7,308,4.4035087719298245
886113,5,6304448392,"Since I have a long-standing meditation practice, I did not buy this tape as an introduction to meditation, nor do I believe that it is necessary to attain the lotus postion in order to meditate (although working with this tape will help you do that if that is what you want). I bought the tape to work on my lower back, hips and legs. I have other yoga tapes and CDs, but this is the first one I have found that REALLY opens up the hip area, so I am very happy with it. I like Yee's manner, which is very calm and understated. He is not in your face. For those who are interested in the meditation aspects of the tape, I would say that he does a very good job of walking you through several postures for meditation and how to get into them, plus the exercises for loosening up the pelvis and hips. The Yosemite background is awesome, and Yee is very calming and gentles you into a nice internal space. Several times I have found myself slipping into meditation when my intention was to stay focused on the yoga. I will say that the entire tape is long, about 58 minutes, the first eight minutes being a long introduction that I now skip over after listening the first time.",1291852800,4,1174,4.2690582959641254
886114,5,6304448392,I am relatively new to Yoga with some exposure/practice to meditation.  I've been following this tape and it has helped my body adjust to the sitting posture(s) used in meditation.  I have found it easy to follow and understand.  I'm glad I took the chance and purchased it.,1282521600,,274,4.666666666666667
886184,5,6304448392,"This is my first Yoga DVD.  I received it from a family member as a gift and was skeptical at first, but this is the real deal.  The meditation section (last 3 chapters) is excellent, but even more excellent are the first 2 chapters (25 minutes).  Chapter 1 focuses on back stretching and ""freeing the breath"" as a side effect of stretching.  The second chapter uses a standard chair to expand on back stretching and really get into hip stretching.  Hip stretching sounds somewhat odd, right?  But boy does it improve the way you walk.  It also improves general leg endurance and flexibility and can reduce hip pain over time.  After *noticeable* improvement in back dexterity and alignment after using the first couple chapters once a day for about a week, it's hard to imagine why everyone isn't doing this at least three times a week.  Although Yee implies that the viewer already knows the standard Yoga stances, if you don't know them, you can pick them up from this DVD and his very clear explanations.

In my opinion, this DVD is perfect for people who:
- Have never tried Yoga stretching or meditation before
- Are curious about trying ""New Age"" homeopathy
- Are interested in Rodney Yee for the first time
- Have good general health and are not overweight
- Want to relieve chronic back or leg pain or tightness
- Want to hugely relieve day to day stress and anxiety
- Want to greatly improve their flexibility

In my opinion, this DVD is NOT for people who:
- Are looking for a Yoga cardio workout
- Are overweight (20 pounds or more) or pregnant
- Are uncomfortable looking at a half naked man

Great original music too.  And set in Yosemite.  Not widescreen, but good definition.  Would definitely recommend to everyone and can almost guarantee that Chapters 1 and 2 (25 minutes of your day) will change your life and get you interested in exercise again.  You will walk easier, breathe easier, get more oxygen to your brain, and feel more flexible in your lower body.",1279670400,,1980,4.614285714285714
886185,5,6304448392,"This is broken up into several different parts so you can do one or all of them.  I like to do all of them.  It helps to stretch me back and hips so that I am more limber through my day as I have trouble with both areas.  It is gentle and easy to do with beautiful scenery.  Rodneys voice is very soothing.  I often find at the end that I fall asleep as I am so relaxed.  I personally do not use it for meditation, but it would work well for that if you wanted to do that.  My only complaint is that the only way you can get this is on vhs.",1276300800,,540,3.6842105263157894
886186,5,6304448392,"Only done the practice a few times so far, but it has been a very relaxing journey. Just need more undivided attention on my part. So far, the gentle joga exercises also have been easy to take in and don't stress me out before I even begin the meditations. I am very excited to have chosen this DVD, but then again, I have never been disappointed in Rodney Yee.",1256601600,2,361,4.246376811594203
886187,5,6304448392,"I love to do this video with my 4 year old. She loves watching the kids (especially little Jo Jo) and is excited every time. I like the laid back nature of it and the family dynamics which are fun and without the serious structure of some yoga videos. Its something we do repeatedly and it has enough different levels represented by each family member that it can be as challenging as you desire. Actually, the video has helped my 21 month old do a mean downward facing dog. Great way to get a little yoga in even when the kids are awake!",1242950400,,538,4.233009708737864
886188,5,6304448392,"This is a very enjoyable DVD.  Rodney Yee does a great job of helping you to become relaxed and centered through meditation.  The combination of his soothing voice and the wonderful imagery from several wilderness locales is great.  I found my self becoming relaxed and centered as a natural course of viewing the DVD without having to ""try"" to become relaxed.  That is the hallmark of a great meditation and relaxation program.  Full endorsement.",1238284800,,447,4.986486486486487
886189,5,6304448392,This DVD is a really great intro to yoga. It immediately works on your hips and I saw results after the first session. The DVD itself is stunning just to watch. There truly is nothing to lose and everything to gain when buying this great dvd.,1236556800,,242,4.282608695652174
886190,5,6304448392,"I love this DVD. I would use it everday if I have the time. I highly recommend this, especially for anyone new to meditation.",1229040000,,125,4.25
886191,4,6304448392,This DVD was purchased as a gift for my son and I was mailing it off to him for Christmas. Delivery was prompt and I received DVD in excellent condition. Would not hesitate to purchase products again.,1200009600,,200,4.4324324324324325
886192,4,6304448392,"I enjoy this DVD and use it fairly frequently.  However, the practices are very separate -- they don't flow easily together, so you can't really just do the whole video, one set after the other.  Most people, I think, will find one or two practices useful, and ignore the rest.

The first section, ""Mountain"" is a gentle flow series of yoga postures.  These are slow, easy, and should be within the range of most beginners.  You are left in a cross-legged sitting posture, so that if you keep your remote close by, you can just shut off the video and go straight into meditation.  This makes a nice morning practice.

The second section ""Garden"" is an unusual set of postures done in a chair.  These help make the hips more flexible, so you can sit for longer periods of time in meditation.  Rodney Yee also mentions that you can meditate while sitting in a chair.  This series would be a perfect intro for those that choose this option.  Also, once you learn these postures, it would be easy to do them at work, for a quick yoga break.

The third section, ""Tree"" is purely instructional, teaching four sitting postures that you can use in meditation.  It's not meant as a daily yoga routine.

The fourth section, ""Wind"" is a breathing meditation -- such an important, and often neglected part of yoga.  I use this section fairly often.

The final section ""Sky"" is a guided meditation.  It starts in a standing position, which is a bit inconvenient if you'd like to do the last two practices together. (""Wind"" leaves you lying on your back.) You do sit down to meditate, though.  I use it on days when I need the instruction to get myself settled.  As you progress, of course, you're going to want silence for meditation.

As others have noted, the scenery is pretty -- but I tend not to judge yoga tapes by that.  After all, you are listening more than you are watching, when you do the practice.  I like the music on this one better than others I've heard -- something a bit more important than what the video looks like, I'd think.

This is a useful video; it would have been even more so if ""Mountain"", ""Wind"" and ""Sky"" could blend together more easily to make a complete practice.",1185926400,8,2185,4.5038167938931295
886193,5,6304448392,"I'm a student, and have been really stressed out lately.  I started to get an ulcer (I've had one before), experienced restless sleep, and was generally feeling frazzled.  I'm a spiritual person, but was feeling spiritually deficit with not enough time in the day.  I was desperate and I bought this DVD.

  I only used it a few times, but the result was remarkable and immediate.  I'm a hardcore skeptic about all this free-your-mind, natural-healing stuff, but I couldn't be after this.  The effects would last me through the day.  My posture was corrected.  I didn't experience any heartburn.  I felt oddly ""centered"" (now I get what that word means!), and things just sort of fell into perspective.  I felt nurtured.

  I highly recommend it if you're dealing with stress.",1145923200,11,776,4.861538461538461
886244,3,6304448392,"I was looking for a product that would be a good introduction to yoga, and stress-relief/meditation are always a bonus.  This is a good guide to meditation, except that he keeps talking.  It would probably work well if you use the techniques to your own music or with the mute button.  This product did not do a lot for me, physically.  I am fairly active and was looking for a way to do some stretching and refreshing yoga.  This is not the right DVD.  Good if you want to meditate, but don't buy it if you are looking for physical rather than mental refreshment.",1099785600,9,564,4.375
886245,4,6304448392,"In this video, master yoga instructor Rodney Yee guides the viewer through gentle yoga poses designed to allow you to focus your attention inward.  The practice is divided into 5 segments:
1) Mountain.  Rodney describes this as a ""quiet flow series,"" and it contains about 12 minutes of simple stretches to warm up the body.
2) Garden.  This 13-minute section focuses mainly on hip opening postures such as twists and forward bends performed while sitting on a chair.
3) Tree.  In this section, Rodney spends 10 minutes reviewing 4 basic seating postures used for meditation:  cobbler, hero, sage, and lotus.  Each pose is practiced with and without a block for variation.
4) Wind.  The purpose of this section is to concentrate on breath while in reclining postures; 10 minutes.
5) Sky.  In this final 8-minute section, Rodney leads you through a seated meditation.  His soothing voiceover instruction reminds you to turn your attention inward and to focus on your breathing.
Although I tend to concentrate on postures rather than meditation in my own yoga practice, I found this video to be enjoyable and restorative.  I particularly liked the third section, as Rodney's breathing instruction helped me to really feel a tingling sense of deeper relaxation in my body.  Rodney is an excellent instructor; his beautiful form while practicing is a perfect compliment to the gorgeous background scenery.  This video would work well for anyone looking to add the benefits of meditation to their yoga practice without having to simply sit quietly in a lotus position.",1075334400,40,1563,5.086274509803921
886246,2,6304448392,"I am a fan of Rodney Yee's AM Yoga for Beginners and thought that this would be just as well-turned out as that one.  I also thought it would be a fun video to do yoga with my 3 year old to.  How wrong I was.

The program showcases the Yee Family - Rodney, Donna Fone, and their 3 children.  After a very brief introduction, the family jumps right into the sun salutation poses and does no less than 5 different ones.  Do we really need to do 5 different sun salutations?  In a video that you do alongside kids?  Talk about overkill.  This was supposed to be fun!  Then they go through a series of different poses, each one presented by a different member of the family with the occasional variation thrown in.  My 3 year old lost interest after the 2nd sun salutation pose and left the room.

I'm not saying that this video has to appeal only to preschoolers, but it doesn't even appeal to me!  While there seems to be some sort of progression to the routine, it's not very clear-cut and the video is almost too casual making the choice of poses seem more like an afterthought.  While the credits are running at the end, there's a fun behind the scenes outtake featuring mostly Adesha, the middle child, and you can see that they at least ran through a tiny bit of the routine with the kids, but it doesn't seem like there was much preparation at all.  There are a couple of fun poses, though - the one where your child or partner lies on your back as you do child's pose and another one where you lift up into a bridge pose of sorts (sorry, not that up on all the names of poses) and your child can crawl under you.  Also, Rodney and Donna show how you can help the kids out a bit with some of the poses, but they're too casual about it!  I found this frustrating - I want a little more direction!  I want structure!  :D  I was expecting this to be similar to his AM Yoga for Beginners video where Rodney talks you through the poses.

All in all, this was very disappointing.  I think even if my expectations weren't so high, I'd still find this difficult to do with my child(ren) - the one I did it with was bored (she LOVES Yoga Kids)!  Save your money!

REVISION (11/5/04) - A year later, a year wiser.  My daughter and I have recently started doing this tape again and we are enjoying it much more this time around.  While I still find parts of it redundant and it still looks hastily put together, the fact that my daughter says, ""I can do it!  I can do it!  I want to do this everyday!"" warrants it at least another star, but I guess I can't change my original rating!  Still, recommended with reservations.",1062288000,15,2615,4.228282828282828

At first, looking at the video was disappointing because I knew what Yosemite was ""really"" like, but after a week back, I am glad I have such a beautiful reminder of an incredible place.

All his videos seem to move right along so it will keep your interest.  The only problem with this tape is that it should have ended with a few min. of music so you can stay in the stillness if you like. Instead it Goes right into a commercial for the Yoga Journal Series. Otherwise this tape gives you the foundation to begin a meditation practice.
