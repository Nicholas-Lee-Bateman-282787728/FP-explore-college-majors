1986852,5,B0001CNQCG,"We first checked this DVD out from the library, but have since purchased it.  My son (3) loves the movie, laughing out loud and quoting the bedbug!  I like the movie because, unlike so many movies marketed towards children, there is no violence and the characters don't call each other names.  I also like that it is relatively short (45 minutes), more appropriate for young children than a full-length feature film.  I agree, it's not for a 14 month old.  Very, very, very few movies are!!",1107302400,2,490,4.651162790697675
1986853,5,B0001CNQCG,"My 3yr old loves this movie, and so do I....and I'm 38! The colors, and innocent nature of the film, along with the moral, make it such a wonderful way to share with your children. My daughter always asks for ""buggies"". She loves the bright colors, and the fact that the lost babies get a new mommy. I think I like what they call their home....""cozy hole"", because that's what a home should be.........cozy, and loving. Just like this movie portrays it.",1106870400,,453,4.536585365853658
1986854,5,B0001CNQCG,"we purchased this dvd for our one year old daughter.she absolutely adores it. She loves the colors, voices and always smiles and laughes throughout the video. The dvd has a good story with excellent moral values. She watches this almost everyday and it keeps her attention. This dvd is good for all ages including adults. We highly recommend.",1105056000,,342,4.913793103448276
1986855,2,B0001CNQCG,"I think this movie is for older children. I am a mother of a 14 month old and was just looking for something different, I have seen Nemo and Toy Story till I am quoting. When my daughter took one look at Spidarious she screamed in terror, it was really sad. I think he is scary also and the lady spider he falls for in the end looks like the Devil. The beginning of it was a turn off because of Spidarious but it did get better however I did think he was a bit evil for a children's film.",1092700800,3,488,3.89
1986856,5,B0001CNQCG,"My daughter Lily loves Miss Spider. I rented this for her and she has watched it every day. I""m going to buy it for our vacation. The movie has all the bright colors like the book and the voice of Brooke Shields as Miss Spider. It is not loud and it is very soft and well done. The DVD has extras that are well worth the money. David Kirk reads the book and there are also more stories. Miss Spider also talks about all her kids and their names and personalities. You can't miss with this purchase and get the book too.",1091404800,7,519,4.098039215686274
1986857,5,B0001CNQCG,We tivoed this off of Nickelodeon months ago when my son was 5 months old.  He still loves it and I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD/Video.  I highly recommend it!,1090800000,2,174,3.942857142857143
1986858,5,B0001CNQCG,"My 3-yr.-old has watched this video every day for a month. He absolutely loves it. It has a great message for kids--about motherly love and taking care of each other. He's not a kid who really gets into movies, but this one keeps him captivated for the entire time it plays.",1088640000,2,274,4.392156862745098
1986859,5,B0001CNQCG,My son Angel loved this movie when it was televized on Nickelodeon. A must have!!!!,1075075200,2,83,4.6
1986860,5,B0001CNQCG,My three year old twins love this animated movie. We recorded it with Tivo and have watched it countless times. I'm glad to find it on DVD so that I can keep it forever. It's got great computer animation and a good story for children.,1075075200,5,234,4.222222222222222
1986881,1,B0001CNQCG,"I bought 3 DVD's out of this series and am regretting every minute of it...
I purchased them after seeing the trailer on another DVD and thought it looked like a sweet series to get for my 2 year old daughter. I don't think some of the content and one characters in particular are appropriate for young viewers. There is a questionable white spider - male - complete with black eye make up, red lips and frightening sharp, shark-like teeth - what were the producers thinking? I have not read the books, so don't know if this is as he appears in the book, but if so, then I question the author's integrity as a children's book writer...
In one scene he attempts to kill one of the little spiders with a block of ice, and again I have to wonder why a children's author or movie maker would consider this acceptable content for young viewers or readers? Surely this is not a topic that at such a young age they need to be made aware of?

I will be sticking to movies such as Whinnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell, with wholesome imagery and uplifting storylines...
I DO NOT recommend this series at all, unless you are not worried about your child viewing disturbing and questionable movie content.",1234569600,,1189,4.454128440366972
1986882,5,B0001CNQCG,"This a wonderful video which elementary school kids and adults can enjoy watching together.  The animation style is very interesting and unique-- the series has a distinctive ""look"" which is appealing to kids.

It's interesting to read here that a lot of parents are having their babies and toddlers watch lengthy videos, and then are surprised when the little ones find these images scary or overwhelming.  Parents need to use common sense.

There is also a great Miss Spider television series now out on DVD.  Episodes are always based around caring about others, understanding their feelings, and being considerate.  The characters are not perfect-- they make mistakes, etc.  But in the end they learn important lessons about love, family, friendship, and how we should treat others.",1203033600,,786,5.190476190476191
1986883,5,B0001CNQCG,"My three year old daughter loves this movie. It is very clever. I can see where some of the characters could be scary for younger children, but my daughter loves it.",1172534400,,165,4.354838709677419
1986884,5,B0001CNQCG,"""Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids,"" based on David Kirk's book by the same name, is a touching introduction to the land of Sunny Patch for all fans of Miss Spider and her little buglings.

Miss Spider and Holley are two lovebugs and the special begins with their marriage. Spiderus, however, is a carnivorous spider who is jealous of their romance and wants Miss Spider for himself. As he stews, everyone celebrates, until a chicken shows up. They manage to chase out the chicken and the fun resumes, but what they don't realize is that the chicken has left behind an egg.

Miss Spider and Holley settle into life together and eventually, Miss Spider lays eggs. She's excited about becoming a mother, but she's nervous too. She was adopted as a little spiderling by Betty Beetle. Since her adopted Mom really knew nothing about raising a baby spider, she basically had to make it up as she went along. Betty, however, assures her that she'll be a great Mom.

Miss Spider and Holley hatch five little spiders --- Squirt, Wiggle, Spinner and the twins Pansy and Snowdrop. They all soon grow into spirited little kids and Squirt is perhaps the most-spirited of them all. When the kids discover the egg that the chicken left behind, Squirt decides that he needs to return it to his mother, even if in entails danger. On his adventure, he discovers several new friends.

""Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids"" is a delightful special that teaches kindness, bravery and friendship. Fans of the series will delight at learnng the genesis of their buggy friends now seen daily on television and in many books. This special is the only ""Miss Spider"" release by MGM Kids and the only one to star Brooke Shields as the voice of Miss Spider. In the TV show and future specials, Kristin Davis takes over as the voice of Miss Spider.

P.S.: I don't think this film is too scary for little kids. Compared to some of the fare that is out there, the content of this film isn't remotely scary, although, naturally, anyone with a strong fear of spiders might want to avoid it. Other than that, this film is really cute, with occasional scenes of peril, but nothing that anyone older than about three-or-four would probably be too terrified by (and I do believe the intended target audience is probably older preschool to those beginning school and their parents. Oh, and any fan of quality animation.)",1169164800,4,2374,4.710843373493976
1986885,5,B0001CNQCG,"My 2 year old is in love with Miss Spider. This was a great movie because it explained how the kids were adopted. I didn't know this and always wondered. Awesome Movie!

My 4 year old loved Stellaluna. It's a very cute story.",1168473600,2,225,4.232558139534884
1986886,3,B0001CNQCG,"The movie opens with a melancholy, off-beat, off-key melody while we are twisting and winding through a forest, which made me feel disoriented and nauseous. The bad guy, ""Spideris"" is a pale white spider with distorted features, a character Tim Burton (""Corpse bride"") would love.

This character frightened my two-year so much that he grabbed my finger and used it to turn off the TV.

I feel like a terrible father that I allowed him to watch this movie.",1141257600,5,456,4.7594936708860756
1986887,2,B0001CNQCG,"The antagonist in this movie is a very scary looking ghost-white spider with a big human-like face, a huge chin and sharp white teeth contrasting against a blood red mouth.  He made me raise my eyebrows just before sending my three year old screaming and running from the TV.  He shows up in the background in the initial wedding scene, when Miss Spider is getting married, muttering something about why isn't she with him; odd content for a young audience.  Then he shows up mouth wide open ready to gobble one of Miss Spider's eggs that was dropped from a branch on the way to the egg sack.  The egg does get rescued by some flying bug in the knick of time.  We just stopped watching the movie after this point.  We won't be watching it again until I know which scenes to skip a priori.",1135468800,11,788,4.363013698630137
1986888,3,B0001CNQCG,"Cute idea, but a little disjointed and it terrified my 2 yr old.  By the fourth time she saw Spideras she was crying to turn it off, and she doesn't usually get scared.  She asks to see the spiders in Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.  The snakes really scared her as well.  And she hated the idea of losing a mommy - she wouldn't let me out of her sight all evening.  Even though we watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang right afterward, she was talking about scary monsters when she woke up in the morning.",1133136000,6,504,4.154639175257732
1986889,5,B0001CNQCG,"We've been playing this DVD for my daughter since she was about 8 months old and she enjoys the colors!!

They're just so vivid that it caught her attention early on and she hasn't let go.  Now, at 16 months, she still enjoys watching it while she eats on her high chair and it's the only way to keep her still for a while.

We bought this DVD with a package containing Stellaluna at Costco, and a freebie for the High Five musical group, but nothing has caught my daughter's attention more than this DVD.  Growing up with the Disney movies myself, I tried to get her into those movies but they're simply boring for her (of course, she's too little ;-)

Of course, I've enjoyed it, too :-) and always play it for visitors, children and adults, and they always get hooked.

My wife is always laughing at us because my little one and I just get into the movie and don't pay attention to anything else, that's how good it is!!

Two thumbs up!",1115683200,5,939,4.301136363636363
1986890,4,B0001CNQCG,"My 3-year-old twins love this story (so do I), relating closely to the idea that everyone/everything has a home where it belongs.  The variety of bug life in this movie, the bright primary colors, and the ""humanity"" of the creatures in this show (even Scary Spiderus wants to find someone to belong with, and wouldn't it be the best if we all looked out for each other like those bugs?) has influenced my kids to react differently to the crawlers around our home.  Before Sunny Patch their automatic reaction to bugs was ""Mommy I'm scared!""  Now they want to know where the bug lives and why it isn't at home.  Another step towards tolerating and welcoming diversity, from the world of bugs.",1109721600,2,691,4.639344262295082

8009984,1,B0001CNQCG,"After seeing the trailer on another DVD, my three year old graddaughter asked if we could get this movie.  I ordered it for Easter and she watched it that night.  It was absolutely terrifying.  She started to cry and and scream ""turn it off, Grammy!""  Of course we felt horrible.  The trailer looks very cute but there is a very big, white, ugly spider who is oviously ""bad"" and has huge pointed teeth in a blood red mouth.  Really in poor taste for little ones!  We pitched into the garbage where it belongs!",1270771200,,509,4.408602150537634
8009985,3,B0001CNQCG,received in very good condition. Slightly different than the miss spider t.v. show on Nick jr.,1239840000,,94,4.9375
8009986,3,B0001CNQCG,A good story but not for very young children. It is quite dark at times as a character named Spiderus makes it clear that he would eat the bug children or their parents if given the chance! It is based on the tv series but has different voices for the lead characters of Miss Spider and Holley.,1237766400,,294,4.175438596491228
