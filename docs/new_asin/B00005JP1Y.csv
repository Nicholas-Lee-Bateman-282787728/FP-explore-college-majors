1566306,5,B00005JP1Y,"The title 'Darwin's Nightmare' may refer to the infestation of Giant Nile Perch destroying the ecosystem of Lake Victoria, but I suspect it has more to do with how the concept of 'survival of the fittest' is applied to human beings in one of the most awful places on Earth. Children fight over grimy handfuls of rice, with the strongest getting the most, and the gentler weeping over what they have lost (and then starving). These orphans of HIV and other diseases struggle alongside the heavily scarred adults who have somehow survived, prostitution for the women, dangerous, desperate work for the men, and  all of them living off the rotting corpses of fish left after the juicy filets have been air transported to European tables (this is a truly horrendous thing, people stacking and handling worm infested fish frames).Tanzania's problems did not begin with this trade of fish that transformed a fishing/agrarian lifestyle into a feeder industry for fish factories, but the film certainly implies that it did make them worse. Director Sauper has captured the despair of the Tanzanian people, the viciousness of those among them who feed off their pain, and the callousness (or sheer ignorance) of those who profit from it. Yet he also finds grace: A Russian pilot wishing forlornly that he could help all children, and not knowing how, a Tanzanian fishing village leader wearily describing the obvious causes of his people's plight, children rendering down packaging plastic to sniff so they can escape their pathetic lives for a little while.

This sounds like something no one would want to watch, and it certainly would make your average complacent westerner squirm with every remembered whine about the difficulties of their own pampered lives. But Sauper has this STYLE, poetic in presentation, his narrative looping back onto itself to repeat themes again. There are no blunt hammers over the head here. He shows the people and who they are. I suspect Sauper is very brave. He gets into situations that are dicey getting his interviews. And his rapport with people is nuanced, pulling real and thoughtful comments from many of them, even the ones not so nice. Thankfully, he lets us decide who those are. There is little preaching here.

Highly recommended for any teacher trying to show their students a little of what life is like in other parts of the world, and for any one with a heart and a mind.",1153008000,6,2414,4.926289926289926
1566307,3,B00005JP1Y,"A disturbing movie which raises many questions and answers few.  It centers on the fish processing industry in Mwanza, Tanzania.  There the Nile Perch, reportedly a predatory foreign species which has taken over Lake Victoria, is caught and frozen, whence it is exported to Europe by the ton.  Russian and Ukrainian pilots are said to bring loads of armaments with them when they arrive before taking off with the fish.

The movie offers memorable Bosch-like images of those who are drawn to the city as a result of this industry.  Many wretched folk live from the plant offal, there are itinerant fishermen, beggars, assorted prostitutes and glue sniffing orphans in the streets.

What does Darwin have to do with it?  Presumably the Nile Perch, the Europeans and the miserable hangers-on are all part of a vicious struggle in which the fittest grow fat at the expense of the weak.

By juxtaposing images of company officials (all ethnic Indians, not Africans, but we do not learn why) with those of the poor, the movie's director seems to invite criticism of the company and its activities.

But what could this criticism be?  Should the company shut its doors or start to operate as a charity?  Are Tanzanians generally worse off because of the trade in perch?  No evidence is provided that this is so, and there is some reason to think otherwise.  While the movie does little to trace the local benefits of the fish trade, the processing company is said to employ a thousand people.  Was the populace living in happy tranquility before outsiders came?  We are not told, though it is clear that much of the truly atrocious suffering shown is of the readily preventable sort due to HIV AIDS.

European nations and the foreign transport companies are accused of profiting from the misery of Africans by exporting arms, and this is a serious moral criticism.  However, the arms trade is not shown to harm the city of Mwanza.  The town hardly seems awash in modern weapons, as the representative security guard is armed with bow and arrow.

I am no expert on Tanzanian development, but what is irritating about the movie is its message that the misery shown must be due to ""business"", foreign exploitation or globalization.  In reality, anyone who has reflected on the recent changes in Northeast Asia knows how trade and industry have the power to pull nations out of poverty.  During the late fifties the Republic of Korea, now prosperous, had a per person GDP like Ghana's.  Wealth comes from commerce and the intelligent application of private capital, not from foreign handouts, happy primitivism, government or a sharing attitude.  To the extent that Hubert Sauper suggests otherwise he probably does a disservice to the people he depicts.",1152748800,3,2744,4.891774891774892
1566308,5,B00005JP1Y,"DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE is truly that: a nightmare. Filmed on-location in Tanzania along the banks of the massive Lake Victoria, director Hubert Sauper puts the lens of his camera in the face of everyone involved in this human atrocity ...from those who aid it, to those at the bottom of its global circumstances.

The focus is on the gigantic Nile Perch, a freshwater fish of unbelievable size, who was unfortunately introduced to Lake Victoria and has decimated the native fish population. On the upside, however, is the new economy brought by the Nile Perch. Million dollar fish packing operations abound and jobs are available ...but only to a few hundred natives. The remainder live in squalor and on starvation's doorstep. All of the fish, without exception, is flown out of Africa to richer, more affluent, neighboring continents (mostly Europe). The money being made by the IMF and a few select companies is impressive, but can it last?

Mr. Sauper has done something extraordinary. Without putting in any bias, he has allowed this story to unfold on its own. I've never, EVER, seen a documentary like this. I was appalled by the educational system in Tanzania (basically nonexistent) and yet startled by the realization that none of the Tanzanians know or care about the globalization that is causing much of their problems (again, an educational issue). One of the natives that Mr. Sauper interviewed even wished that war would spill over from Angola and into Tanzania so that he could have ""better work"". Incredible!

AIDS, of course, is an ever present item in Africa, and Tanzania is no exception. But the additional problem here is that there are few facilities to care for the infected. On many of the large islands on Lake Victoria, there are no doctors, hospitals, or dispensaries. Prostitution is widespread as women become widowed and have no source of income. Children are on the street, fighting for fists full of rice, early victims of AIDS after losing their parents. And what is the world doing about this ...?

The hidden side-story in the documentary is ""what's on the planes when they land in Tanzania."" High-level officials say, ""Nothing."" But truth be told (by one of the pilots interviewed) sometimes weapons are shipped in on the planes, destined for war-torn areas of Africa. No food. No humanitarian supplies. Nothing else makes it in to Tanzania. We (the world) take from Africa, and all we give it is more death and destruction. This isn't stated directly in the film, but is easily surmised through the interviews.

Finally, there's the airport. Almost as much a character in the film as anyone, this landing field (I hesitate to call it an airport) is a ramshackle building with flies, bees, and broken equipment, resulting in many airliner mishaps throughout the years. A testament to the unspoken fact that the world has no intentions of developing this area. We'll take until there's nothing left, then we'll leave Tanzania and her people to her final verdict.

1566310,3,B00005JP1Y,"I agree with the main point Hubert Sauper is trying to make with this film: that globalization, the increasing interconnectedness linking people and places around the world, has led to a deeply unjust economic order, in which a lucky few reap most of the benefits while most everyone else sees their living standards going from bad to worse. This argument I accept wholeheartedly, but I was disappointed by the manner in which ""Darwin's Nightmare"" tries to convey it.

Sauper brings his camera to the shores of Lake Victoria and talks with a bunch of people: a night watchman, a fish processing plant owner, a journalist, some fishermen, some bar girls, some Ukrainian cargo plane crews, and some street children. (These are the ones we see, anyway.) The pilots and the plant owners are doing okay, but everyone else seems to be facing greater misery and insecurity. This commerce raises some profound ironies: for one, Tanzania is exporting thousands of tons of Nile Perch fillets to Europe while millions of its own citizens are facing famine because they are too poor to buy the food available in the markets; for another, the planes that come to bring Lake Victoria's fish to Europe arrive empty, or sometimes even bringing arms to fuel Africa's bloody conflicts. A meeting of wealthy exporters and trade officials takes place on a posh hotel veranda while crippled children fight over food on the dusty street below.

Sauper's methods pack an emotional punch, but also leave the film open to criticism. Why doesn't he speak to a broader sample of Tanzanians? Why does he allude to issues like the Nile Perch's environmental impact or the arms trade but fail to follow up on them? Most importantly, why does he rely solely on anecdotal evidence to get his message across? The ""big picture"" is hinted at and only fleetingly glimpsed.

I ordered this DVD to show to students in a course on globalization. Like me, they found it disturbing and evocative, but less compelling than others we'd watched on similar themes.  (Stephanie Black's 2001 documentary ""Life and Debt,"" about globalization's impact in Jamaica, was much more effective in this regard.)  Those who are inclined to accept Sauper's thinking may come away wanting more, and those inclined to be skeptical will find his case easier to dismiss, which is a shame, because it deserves to be hammered home in the most powerful way possible.",1152316800,43,2401,4.933168316831683

1566416,5,B00005JP1Y,"Some people really don't understand this film. The REAL subject matter takes place right near the very end! I remember the night when I first saw this film. During the last few minutes, and as the credits began rolling, no one moved. The entire audience was stunned, unable to move or think. We were physically motionless, our minds frozen, dazed, the hairs on our heads stood on end.  Not a word was spoken while we realized the profound implications of what we'd just seen. What we would take from it was not what we'd thought, not what had been billed, and yet we knew not a single one of us would ever be the same.

I was among those with the fortunate opportunity to meet the director, Hubert Sauper, in person, for a Q & A session regarding what he'd unmistakably and purely accidentally uncovered by the close of this film. In an astoundingly open and honest discussion he answered questions and talked of his experiences while making the film. He explained how he planned its beginning, then explained when and how he knew he'd have to end it and leave abruptly after innocently discovering what he'd never planned to know -  and why he decided to include that revelation exactly as it played out. The minute I left the theatre I knew I'd have to own my own copy so I could watch it again.  And, show others. And if I were able, I'd buy everyone a copy because I felt it was that important.

A simply ASTOUNDING film that everyone, particularly those in the USA, should see. It won awards the world over. One moment I thought I was watching a film about the fishing industry at Lake Victoria, Africa. Then prostitution, hunger, murder, and other atrocities were revealed. Just when it was about to be over, suddenly I realized the camera had picked up something else, something not meant to be known. It wasn't drugs, not murder, not suicide, not euthanasia, but something far worse, and I was speechless! I couldn't move, my brain was numb. I knew what I saw and what it meant! Mr. Sauper verified my thoughts. I left with a headache, bursting with anger, more questions, and pent up energy. This was real! I felt sick to my stomach. My husband and I crossed the parking lot silently, in deep thought, saying nothing because we were numb with the reality of what had been shown us. Instead we watched each step we took until we reached the car. It's been a few years now since that premier, but I still feel the same when I recall or re-watch this film. It's still real and still a nightmare!",1194652800,9,2501,4.5

1566418,3,B00005JP1Y,"The story of darwins nightmare is a harsh one, similar in some ways to movies such as blood diamond or lord of war... all staged in africa.
Darwins nightmare is presented as a documentary about how an introduced species of fish (nile perch) to lake victoria, tanzania, a few decades ago, which has spawned the industry of trade within europe for the nile perch. So the story goes, the pilots fly in from europe with supposedly 'empty' planes, and fly out with a huge quantity of fish, while the locals are stuck in a rut called life.... aid's, murder, drugs and all things in between are their companions, while the world goes on and we eat the fish for dinner, unknowing what the story is behind our meal.

1566419,4,B00005JP1Y,"You should watch this movie. It's one the most beautifully shot docs I've ever seem it. It's incredibly poetic in face of chaos, despair, illness, violence and extreme poverty. I didn't have a problem with its fragmented narrative and the lack of a clear exposition on various subjects. For me, the images and some of the characters covered a lot of ground and they are much more eloquent than academic or journalistic explanations.
I've read the director statement and production notes from the film's web site, that helped me understand his motivations and the incredible difficulties he faced to film such a harrowing project. That said, I was bit disappointed by the lack of a more intimate approach with some characters. The street kids, the night guard and the prostitutes, just to name a few cloud have been better used and I wanted more of them instead of others that are a bit too obvious.
The director's method is very honest and critical, hard to argued with that, but he apparently refuses to show a unique scene where these people have something to look for, always choosing a more dramatic and sad point of view with a Eurocentric approach he exposes and opposes so well in the movie. Maybe pursuing this elusive element of some happiness in face of horror would have been an even more challenging accomplishment. He mentions in his web site that this movie could've been done in many other countries just replacing the fish by oil, diamonds or bananas. That's is true but having myself been to some of these places and witnessing similar terror I've believe the most impressive qualities of human race to be hope and endurance. You'll see a lot of the later but little hope in this movie.",1183075200,,1703,4.756756756756757
1566420,3,B00005JP1Y,"I would just like to present my problem with the long-awaited Region 1 release of Darwin's Nightmare, one of my top films of 2005 (along with 75 top 10 lists, as the cover of the DVD champions) - for details on the film's content, feel free to read other reviewer's reactions; I will only be addressing Image/HVE's release.

The film itself transfers well enough from big screen to small without much negative effect.  The principle complaint here is the simply awful job on the subtitles.  Darwin's Nightmare is mostly in english, though most of the interviewed subjects speak a much-broken variety of the language (a great, perhaps unintended charm of the film).  This has given the production reason to feature subtitles, as some of the dialogue is rather hard to comprehend at times.

However, the subtitles on this disc are sloppy and inconsistent.  Subtitles actually flicker at some points while on screen - the very first subtitles that appear (singing the words ""Tanzania, Tanzania"") flashed on and off the screen so quickly that I wasn't even sure I saw them.  Several moments of film feature dialogue that is close to indecipherable even when listening closely, yet these moments are not subtitled.  The next scene might feature more clearly spoken words and feature subtitles.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to what subtitles made the DVD (except, of course, when there was a foreign language - and even then, the translation was sparse and there was much dialogue left unsubbed).  This makes it a particularly difficult watch for anyone who might be even slightly hearing impaired.

The DVD features no option for additional subtitles.  I find this all most perplexing because I seem to recall subtitles appearing throughout the film when I saw it theatrically (multiple times).

The bonus features on the disc include another Sauper documentary called Kisangani Diary, an interview with Sauper and the theatrical trailer for Darwin's Nightmare.  While I would have hoped to see some cut footage, I am not as disappointed with the special features as I am with the very lackluster presentation of the film itself.",1182297600,3,2133,5.005665722379604
1566421,3,B00005JP1Y,"The horrifying conditions of life shown in ""Darwin's Nightmare"" are truly shocking, real nightmare as the film's title says. This controversial film shot in Mwanza, Tanzania, however, would raise more questions than answer - which is not exactly a bad thing as documentary, I admit - but here things are a little different. In a nutshell, I heartily agree with the film's `Nightmare' part though I am not fully convinced with its Darwinian theory about the economy and globalization seen through the fish industry in Tanzania.

Film's director Hubert Sauper shot ""Darwin's Nightmare"" almost entirely in Mwanza. The film records the interviews with the local people living in the city and several Russian and Ukrainian pilots of the cargos carrying fish called Nile perch, introduced in Lake Victoria in the 1950s (the cause still unknown). Because of Nile perch some or many of the native species in the lake have gone nearly or completely extinct, but the new fish has also brought new industry to Mwanza. Lots of Nile perch is sliced in the local fish factory and the meat is exported to European countries.

Besides the pilots, the interviewees include such people as fish factory owner, women at the bar, homeless children in the street, preacher, artist and a talkative night watchman called Rafael. But more shocking is the images of them living in the appalling condition. Festering carcasses of fish heaped on the ground is just one of them, or street children fighting over food.

Having admitted the emotional impact and the importance of the issue, however, I was wondering while watching this film - Are they all living like that? What is strange to me is, according to Wikipedia population of Mwanza is about 300,000, but the impression of the town I got from the film is very different. In the film Mwanza second largest city in Tanzania looks much smaller than this number implies.

Perhaps that's because the film never interviews certain strata of people. We see a glimpse of factory workers busily working, but none of them stands before the camera. The camera repeatedly shows the street children, but we cannot be sure whether they represent the usual or 'normal' condition for the ordinary children living there.

Moreover, as the previous reviewer says, the film deals with suspected arms trades by an empty cargo from Europe, but only suggests its possibility. The film tries to cover a broader theme, but I'm afraid the topic is explored not deep enough.

To some extent this unbalanced structure of the film is understandable. The filmmakers must have filmed the interviews under heavily restricted conditions. It is easy to imagine many of the people were extremely reluctant to answer, so `guerrilla filmmaking' would be necessary to shoot the places and have some comments. You cannot just go and ask questions, and that's the same all over the world.

""Darwin's Nightmare"" is a good starting point to think about any social issues represented by Nile perch, especially the negative side of globalization. But how about the positive side? Or how are things going on in Uganda and Kenya, other two countries where Lake Victoria is part of the nation's territory? I hope Mr. Sauper or someone else would follow up this job because for all its big flaws the film certainly makes us think, and few documentaries can do that. Until then, I'm sorry, but three stars.",1173225600,3,3388,4.964726631393298
1566422,4,B00005JP1Y,"Darwin's Nightmare is indeed a nightmare. The visuals alone make this film a must see because not enough people in the Western European and American hemisphere are aware of the terrible ramifacations of globalization.

The movie begins showing an airplane traveling across the country landscape and communicating with an air traffic controller who's working with broken down equipment and more irritated by the bees buzzing around the dingy office space. Tanzania is an extremely poor country to begin with and the filmmaker spends time displaying the poverty and destitution of Tanzanians living by Lake Victoria. An accidental or purposeful release of Nile Perch into Lake Victoria sometime back in the early 1960's proved disastrous as the fish is a voracious predator and consumed those fish already in existence in the lake. These enormous anadramous fish species came to dominate the lake but also, ironically, provide a means of income for Tanzanians who are able to export the fish to Europeans abroad. The filmmaker interviews the owner of one of the major fish companies in charge of exporting Nile perch and you get the impression that relative to the poverty of the streets, some Tanzanians are benefiting working at the fish plants filleting the Nicle perch. But what we don't see is what kind of income these Tanzanians who work in the fish plants are making and how much better are there living standards. The tragedy, however, is that the fillets get exported abroad and the rest of the fish is left over for the Tanzanians who feed off the fish carcasses and are severely malnourished. The filmmaker keeps coming back to the question of what exactly are the planes bringing to the Tanzanian people and is the country benefitting from this export of fish? Its suggested that military arms are indeed what these plans bring back with them to Tanzania fueling civil wars in these African nations. And the Tanzanians are feeding the Europeans with their Nile Perch. Not exactly an ideal exchange, is it??  The filmmaker, however, does not do an adequate job of interviewing everyone who's relevant to this story and he is biased, without question. Nonetheless, the imagery is so powerful, it leaves you wanting to know more about Tanzania's situation and why it is the country remains so poor and how callous the Western nations come across. I can't recommend this movie enough if only to remind people of the terrible cost of globalization.",1163376000,,2454,5.012254901960785

7941733,3,B00005JP1Y,"I would probably find myself agreeing with filmmaker Hubert Sauper about most political and economic issues. I'm almost certain we'd be horrified by the same conditions and look for similar solutions. But I can't say that I'm very satisfied with this impressionist and disingenuous portrayal of the ecological and economic issues of Tanzania, of Lake Victoria and the other Rift Lakes, and of Africa as a whole continent of strife and poverty. ""Darwin's Nightmare"" isn't a documentary in the usual 'educational' sense; it's a visual poem of ugliness, somewhat comparable to ""Koyaanisqatsi - Life Out of Balance"" but lacking the music of Philip Glass to unify it. The 'cast' of the film are inarticulate; that's hardly their fault, since they are all asked to express their worlds in words of a language they barely speak, English. They are street children, prostitutes, village fishermen and a few local managers, all Swahili speakers. Or they are Russian 'bush' pilots, none to eager to leak any company secrets. They are revealed as squalid, degraded, disillusioned victims, some of whom admit to finding their current degradation more comfortable than the alternatives they fled from.

Some time roughly 50 years ago, the Nile Perch, a fish indigenous to much of Africa, was introduced to Lake Victoria. It's a tough voracious predator, this perch, one of the largest of freshwater species reaching several hundred pounds in weight. Ecologically isolated Lake Victoria was home to several hundred species of fish, chiefly cichlids, all of which were easy prey for the Nile Perch, and most of which have now become rare to extinct. The film suggests that Lake Victoria has become a foul sump of deoxygenated water as a result of the 'Darwinian' competition, the 'survival of the fittest' in which the Nile Perch has devastated Nature in symbolically the same sense that Europeans have devastated Africa in the competition for resources. But there's nothing Darwinian about this drama. It wasn't ""evolution"" that brought the Nile Perch to Lake Victoria. On the contrary, it was the slow expressivity of ""descent with modification"" that was disrupted by anthropogenic rapid change -- not climate change in this case, but in fact a fairly vivid example of the calamities we can expect from anthropogenic global warming. And 'colonialism' can't be blamed on Darwin, though the perversion called 'Social Darwinism' played a role. This film is mistitled; it should be called ""Adam Smith's Nightmare"" or perhaps ""Milton Friedman's Nightmare"". 'Capitalism' and 'Free Trade' are not forces of Nature; they are human institutions, subject to human decision-making and enlightened self-interest. Unfortunately, the 'enlightenment' hasn't kept pace with the 'self-interest.'

Critics of this film have pointed out that at least 25% of Tanzania's export income is derived from the fish carried to European markets by those bearish, oafish Russian pilots. Supporters of the film respond that the planes don't return to Tanzania as 'empty' as officials and businesses claim. Instead they often carry cargoes of illicit munitions to sustain the nearly constant regional warfare that plague Africa. One of the Russian pilots recounts an earlier flight assignment, carrying machine guns to the child guerillas of Angola and then transporting grapes from South Africa to the children of Europe. That's one of the starkest and clearest statements in the film, but a real documentary might well have connected the dots, might have reflected that such a 'triangular' trade was a modern recrudescence of the 18th C 'Atlantic System' that carried British guns to Africa, slaves to the Americas, and sugar to Europe. Globalization is not so new!  Novus ordo seclorum, my foot!

I suppose the message implicit in Hubert Sauper's dystopian vision is that globalization has failed to sustain cultural and humanitarian values. Thus the subsidiary calamity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa, among the displaced villagers and deranged warriors, appears in tandem with the famine caused by ecological disruption and capitalist exploitation. Well, I can't disagree with any part of that message. But I can't imagine that this jumble of images, herky-jerkily edited, will elucidate much for most viewers or convince most beneficiaries of liberal economics that ugliness and misery are partly their fault.",1314662400,2,4374,5.334782608695652
7941734,5,B00005JP1Y,"If you want to understand how things work in this world, Darwin's Nightmare along with Food Inc. are required viewing. Food Inc. takes you behind the scenes of food production to show you the dirty little secrets the food corporations don't want you to see. You'll see fist hand how they cut corners to produce ""cheap"" food (in both senses, price & quality). On a positive note, this film will teach you how to make healthier food choices in the grocery store.

Darwin's Nightmare takes place in a fishing village overlooking Lake Victoria, the second largest lake in the world and shows you the misery unrestrained capitalism can cause as told to you directly from the struggling fishermen who scrape a living from  it, low paid Ukrainian pilots who fly rickety old cargo airplanes dangerously loaded down with 55 ton loads of Nile Perch fish, women forced to serve them as prostitutes because of poverty and destitute street children who get by, by getting high and fighting over food scraps. Watching the film and seeing Tanzanian factory workers cut, freeze blast and shrink wrap thousands of fish fillets while learning that most Tanzanians can't afford to buy the fish caught in their own lake comes across as a huge injustice. A report at the time of filming indicating that there were 2 million Tanzanians starving and needing food aid from the UN World Food Program drives home the point further. Darwin's Nightmare gives us rare access to these people whose stories never seem to get told by the major media outlets. We must thank Hubert Sauper for allowing his camera to keep rolling as the people of this Tanzanian fishing village tell their stories intimately. This one's not to be missed if you want to know how the other half of the world lives.",1268092800,,1760,4.786184210526316
7941735,2,B00005JP1Y,"The blurb on the DVD copy of this documentary poses some fundamental questions, including the role of environmental meddling (if you can call 'one man, with one bucket, in one afternoon' introducing the Nile Perch to the Lake Victoria ecosystem that); prostitution in the cargo business (in East Africa, we're used to seeing this on truck routes - seeing this on air routes brings in a whole new dimension), as well as issues of food security. Like I said, the blurb promises much, but fails to deliver on any of these issues, especially the environmental one, which is the key one, going by the title of the film. There are no experts to put things in context, and there is hardly a mention of any other fish in the Lake (including tilapia - perhaps the second biggest species fished in the Lake). There is no acknowledgement that Lake Victoria is shared by three countries (the other two being Uganda and my own Kenya, in which a lot of these issues are replicated) - meaning that the casual or uninformed viewer will assume that Lake Victoria is only a Tanzanian lake. As another reviewer stated, the main issues are dealt with in a supremely unsatisfying, almost casual way, which does a great injustice to the issues it sets out to address.

Secondly, and a more serious indictment to a documentary filmmaker, is that the translations from Kiswahili are mostly completely wrong, giving a much worse picture (especially of the streetkids) than is true from hearing the original statements these kids make. The translations are geared towards making the situation worse than it seems, and to me, destroyed a lot of the credibility of this film. If this is done with words, how much worse was it when it came to the selective pictures used? Let's face it, any documentary filmmaker will leave some things out and put others in, purely at their own discretion, but these should not be egregiously geared to skewing a picture totally out of kilter.

The style of the film is very evocative, and very emotional, so I would guess it served at least one purpose. One can argue whether not having a narrator enhances or takes away the effectiveness of the film, but my take is that that would be quibbling.

However, I think the blurb on the DVD (at least) raises some very important questions, and I would venture that these issues await a better filmmaker to hash them out.",1244505600,14,2371,4.708433734939759
7941736,3,B00005JP1Y,"Globalization by definition is the interaction of companies and government of different nations and this can have both positive and negative effects. Darwin's Nightmare uncovers the exploitative side this outreach. It is unfortunate that in a country children are homeless, people are starving and dying of HIV/AIDS and women are prostituting in order to survive, whereas they are in possession of a well productive artifact. The people who benefit from the Nile perch are the rich Europeans, the Indian and Ukrainians who fly in and out of Tanzania with this fish.

These foreign companies carry tons of the Nile perch and sell it in their countries. Tanzanians are left with nothing to eat but the left over fish bones that were not carried away to these better established countries. Children walk around at night and forced to stay awake to protect themselves from dangers. At times these children smoke, inhale toxic substances and get high from the plastic-foam fumes used to package these fish for the foreign companies.

Women prostitute, and receive a measly pay of 10 dollars from their foreign clients. The HIV/AIDs epidemic is on the rise and victims of this incurable disease are sent back to their village to die. The lack of Tanzanians educational and employment opportunity has made it difficult for people to excel in their education and non-fishermen are unable to obtain a job. Sadly, the local citizens of Tanzania assist in the shipping of the Nile perch to these foreign countries. At the end of the day these fishermen should realize that they're not only destroying their country but they are hurting themselves. Tanzania's government should take control of their country and primarily distribute this Nile perch to fellow Tanzanians and limit the amount of fish these foreign companies are stealing.",1239667200,,1824,5.117449664429531

The Nile Perch affects the entire community in a way unlike anything I've ever seen.  People are reduced to scraps for food in order to survive.  The slow pace of the movie draws you in to the way of life of the Tanzanian people, and you feel how they feel.  It truly is a nightmare-ish way to live.",1239235200,,398,4.197368421052632
