6505305,4,B00LTO342M,I just retired after 38 years in corporate offfices. I didn't like the show when I was working. Now that im retired I  find the show amusing with distance from working in one. I did see the original Ricky Gervais version and theyve done a good job of showing the same craziness in the US.,1530748800,,288,4.236363636363636

6505307,5,B00LTO342M,"I just love this series. The writing, casting, and acting are all superb. The characters on the show aren`t actors, but are friends I know and love. This is one of the series that Americans have embraced as an iconic experience.",1530403200,,228,4.585365853658536
6505308,5,B00LTO342M,"This is just the best show of all time. Perhaps I'm a bit biased because it holds a special place in my heart due to the fact that I started watching the show in 8th grade and all through college, and it was always a big weekly viewing party event with my friends. So there's always a huge sense of nostalgia and good memories in that regard when I watch the show. But the show itself is just hilarious, heart-warming, and always makes my wife and I laugh no matter how many times we've watched. Another great part about the show is there's always new things you pick up on when re-watching - small jokes or things in the backgrounds of shots or references that I didn't pick up on before. I couldn't recommend this show enough. This DVD set is great because it includes bloopers and deleted scenes, and I love the bloopers almost as much as the shots that made it into the actual show (and makes the shots that made it into the show that much more funny).",1530230400,2,956,4.287292817679558

6505310,3,B00LTO342M,"Well, to start I'd like to say I love the office so that's why it's got 3 stars... all of the seasons with multiple discs in them were all popped out of their place. Season 2 disc 1 so dirty it won't play. Have to go get it cleaned to see if that helps. Other discs looked like they sat out in the heat for days and days. I just don't get how I can pay that price for this crap. Plus go pay to get them cleaned up enough to hopefully play. I'm not so sure about the heat damaged ones, but i haven't gotten to the 3rd season yet. And that's where it starts..",1529625600,,557,3.810344827586207

6505373,5,B00LTO342M,The Office has replaced Seinfeld as my favorite t.v. series of all time.  Every character in this shows feels like family and there is not a single episode  that I don't enjoy.  The writers/produces really did a great job putting this cast together and kept each season fresh by adding new characters and hilarious situations.  After Michael Scott (Steve Carell) left the show started to fade but for several seasons each episode was a blast.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves comedy.,1524614400,2,502,4.858823529411764
6505374,5,B00LTO342M,"I just laugh my head off and my husband thinks I'm crazy because I must have seen The Office in its entirety at least 20 times but I still binge on it (it's my go-to background noise when I'm cooking) and still find Jim, Dwight and the rest just as funny as when it premiered. I rarely watch DVDs, and the entire season is currently on Netflix, but I bought this should Netflix ever drop it. Geez, I kind of sound like a junkie when I actually write that.

One of the rare shows that stayed true to itself and remained hilarious right through the series finale.",1524528000,3,561,4.242990654205608

6505436,5,B00LTO342M,"The Review
The Office is one of the best sitcoms of the 21st century. It took the idea of working a 9-5 job at an office, and turned it into an Emmy and Golden Globe winning tv show that millions of people watched every week. It is set it the style of a mock documentary and by later in the sitcom you start to figure that fact out more and more. The star of the show is Michael Scott, who is the boss of the office. Later on after season 7, the star of the show shifts from Michael to the rest of the main cast: Jim, Pam, and Dwight. There are a ton of memorable events that happen every episode that include the progression of Jim and Pams relationship, Jims pranks on Dwight, and most importantly, the Dundies.
The lack of a laugh track at all in any point in this show exaggerates the ridiculous things that Michael Scott says and almost makes you feel like you're right there experiencing the show. The inside jokes in the office will make you fall in love with the show and adds to the mockumentary style of the show. Dwight and Jim, the two top salesman at Dunder Mifflin, play pranks on each other all the time in the office. Dwights actions and authoritarian beliefs and Jims ridiculously funny pranks on Dwight will make you laugh out loud. These two are one of the highlights of the show and prove that no matter how different two people can be, there is always a possibility of them becoming friends in the future. The Dundies are an annual award show that takes place at a restaurant. Fun fact: the first one of the series took place in a Chilis. Michael always goes all out for this event: he wears a suit and practices his lines for the show. Dundies episodes are the most amusing because of the contrast of Michaels over excitement and the rest of the offices boredom. To quote Oscar, an accountant in The Office The Dundies are kind of like a kid's birthday party. And you go, and there's really nothing for you to do there, but the kid's having a really good time, so you... You're kind of there. That's... That's kind of what it's like.
Some people might say that after Michael left in season 7, the show became less interesting but the show became more insightful by shifting from focusing on Michael Scott to the casts relationship with each other in more detail than previous seasons, while still keeping the comedy from the previous seasons. One of the topics that the later seasons focuses on is Jim and Pams struggles in their relationship. They eventually fix their issues and show us that not every relationship is perfect.
If you are looking for a new, unique show to watch and love to laugh, your search is over. The Office will make you laugh no matter age, gender, race, etc. I guarantee that there is an office episode that will make you laugh out loud.",1522972800,,2785,4.409708737864078

6505462,5,B00LTO342M,The first 2 or 3 episodes were lousy and I thought I had made a mistake buying this series.  I have come to really enjoy it as the characters are developed really well.  This is not the kind of show you can watch while you are working out.  The show is mainly dialogue and no action.  I watch it before going to bed at night and it puts me in a good mood.  The boss can be annoying at times as Steve Carell pushes the character a bit too far (in fact that is reason the first few episodes were so poor.  Either he toned it down or I just got used to it.),1521763200,,554,3.8157894736842106

6505578,4,B00LTO342M,"The show itself it great, but there are some downsides to getting the boxed set. When the seasons are purchased separately, the DVDs have artwork on them (i.e. pictures of the characters). These DVDs are shiny on both sides and just say The Office and what Season and Disk number they are, which is less fun in my opinion. They also open like a regular case, unlike individual seasons which unfold multiple times. It's nice to have them in a set, but I do prefer the packaging when seasons are purchased individually. This was a much better price though, and these cases take up less space.",1518393600,,590,4.5754716981132075

6505667,5,B00LTO342M,"I purchased this set for my brother at Christmas time and decided to watch a few episodes with him. I won't comment much on the merits of the show beyond noting it is beloved for a reason (although it is significantly cheerier than the British original); I feel that the episodes following Steve Carell's departure removed the show's heart, but I thoroughly enjoyed the series finale. My main purpose with this review, however, is to comment on the merits of the box set itself. Unlike some prior releases of seasons shortly subsequent to their airing, this set includes a significant amount of bonus material, including gag reels, director and actor commentary, and deleted scenes. This is one of the great advantages over streaming services like Hulu and Netflix, but I am admittedly somewhat of a traditionalist in my preference for physical ownership. The DVDs also have subtitles available in both English and Spanish. Besides these bonuses, the episodes themselves are always enjoyable.

It is interesting on the exterior to note that, except for the final season, at the top of each case is Steve Carell and how much his appearance changed over the years. While a few other reviewers complained of cosmetic damage to their DVDs, I had no issues except for a few bumps on the corners of the box. On the whole, my brother was thrilled with his gift and it was a great bonding opportunity for us to enjoy a few episodes together.",1516492800,29,1433,4.82520325203252

It would have been great to have perspectives on the last episode; for example, because the table read bonus segment for that episode was NOT what they eventually broadcast, I would have liked to know how they sprang the major character change at the wedding (I won't give it away) on the rest of the cast and how it was received. Almost every episode has a ""deleted scenes"" bonus as well as lots of other goodies.

I agree with other reviewers that the last two years were not as good without Michael Scott, and I personally found Andy and Ryan extremely annoying as the series went on, but I realize it must be great acting for me to dislike their characters. Some of the Dwight going out of control episodes were over the top and, I feel, dragged on too long (like the fake radio interview routine). But even given all that, I still enjoyed it very much and was quite sad at the last episode. Now if I can only get Hunter's song out of my head!",1502928000,,1084,4.393034825870647

I just made it to season 9 and realized I have two disk 2's and no disk3. I eurge everyone to check when you buy cause it's August n my return policy was done in June.

6505912,5,B00LTO342M,"NBC has removed the office bloopers from YouTube, so they're un-watchable on streaming devices and blu ray players. This box set includes ALL of them in high definition (which was never on YouTube). Much more enjoyable.

Wow, great pictures and design on the outside of the box itself, all nine seasons individually wrapped and have different images on them. Bloopers, over 15 hours of deleted scenes, all webisodes, MICHAEL SCOTT'S AD and Dwight schrute MUSIC VIDEO. And LOADS more content. For $39.95? Insane deal.

Buy immediately if you like the office at all. Always good to have it (or as a backup in case you have it on a hard drive), because dvd's come in handy all the time.

So so so happy I bought it. Opening it tonight and bingeing the entire series.

6505956,2,B00LTO342M,"This is a review of the product, not the series.  As a big fan of the series who watched it beginning to end numerous times via online streaming services, I decided to buy the discs.  First off, the very first disc skipped and stopped playing numerous times.  There are no obvious scratches and it's definitely not my player (Oppo).  I think it's just low quality control while burning the disc.  Look at how many other reviewers have similar issues.  Additionally, the overall disc production is awful.  At the main menu level I have the list of episodes on the disc.  If I want to play one of them I select it which then takes me to another submenu with a brief description with the option to play.  Just let me play it from the main episode list.  I know it sounds nit-picky, but it just seems to be a very clunky menu setup.  Also, each episode is a single track.  Take a look at how Shout Factory does their complete series offerings and take a hint.  Shout Factory makes each episode with multiple tracks (opening credits/theme song, 3 or 4 tracks for the meat of the episode, and one for closing credits).  It makes it easy to skip around and pick up where I left off.

Overall just poor execution.  The Office deserves better.",1491868800,7,1234,4.441964285714286

Anyway, this show has been consistently funny and had lots of great writing.  It also had great drama at times.  Lots of fun surprizes.  In the beginning it was more like the British office, with the long pauses and awkwardness, but over time transitioned to incorporate some less dry American style humor.  It also pulled off a seemingly impossible feat: keeping the show good after losing the main character.  Props to the writers and actors.",1462579200,3,630,4.504424778761062

6506040,5,B00LTO342M,"Pro: Goodway to kill time and fun to watch!
Cons:  Not family friendly and takes a certain type of humor

Full of emotions: One thing I enjoy about The Office is that is that it's filled with so much emotions. I can honestly say that throughout the whole series I laughed, cried, and was shocked about how the shows were presented. That is something that I rarely find in most shows that I really appreciate in this one.
Great storyline: Another very awesome thing about The office is that you can start from the middle of the season five and you would be able to get in to the storyline with ease! Even though staring from the middle isn't ideal it is definatly possible, that is not the case for most shows. Also, this show differs from other story lines because it doesn't one main character, instead focuses on 5 paper salesman and the things they do in there workplace/life!
Relatable: The thing about this show that anyone could tell you is that this show is extremely relatable. If you have ever worked in a office before you could see where this show is coming from. They take all the stereotypes of an average office and amplify them until they are just unbelievably dry and hilarious!
Great characters: The office has a whole bunch of likable characters. Their is Dwight the farmer stickler of the office that religiously follows the rules, theirs Pam the recptionist that is the offices moral compass and tries to keep the office running smoothly without distractions, then theres Jim that is almost the comic relief that turns everything into a funny sarcastic situation, lastly there is my personal favorite Michel Scott the regional manager who has no filter and does everything you are not supposed to in an office situation.
Great ending: I strongly dislike when I'm watching a really good show and I expect  an amazing, crazy-spectaular ending and it ends up being a bust. when it comes to the office ending holds true and is an extremely bittersweet ending.",1452384000,,1975,4.702312138728324

It was especially difficult to see him hurt the small paper company when he and Dwight pretended to be interested in ordering from them and even working for them.  A few episodes later when Michael Scott had left Dunder Mifflin he called them hoping for a job, only to hear the sad recording that this business had closed.  We like the out takes too and are about half done in watching the program.  Dwight has few redeeming qualities though most of the characters have things that make us like them from time to time.

I've watched countless tv series beggining to end and never have I felt the emotional connection I do to the characters on this show. I still tear up with a mixed bag of joy excitement and sadness when that final episode gets into the final minutes. This show has been my favorite tv series for some time. It is supirb in every way.

6506093,5,B00LTO342M,"The Office will certainly stand out as one of the best comedies of its time, and for many one of the best of all time.  Even after being off the air for a few years now, the show holds up very well.  While it probably is guilty of holding on too long, and the show definitely lost something when Steve Carell left the show toward the end of season 7, it still had some very funny moments in the final two seasons.  By now most people reading this will know the show enough that I will not spend much time reviewing the show itself.  For those who have not seen it, it is a sitcom adapted from a British series of the same name, where a documentary film crew follows the day to day lives of people working for a paper supply company.  It was definitely a different kind of sitcom.  It did not rely on laugh tracks and could be very edgy for network TV.  It truly was an ensemble cast, but Steve Carell's character Michael Scott was definitely the glue that held all the characters and story lines together.  He managed to be a complete doofus in one moment, caring and protective in another, and even very cunning the next.  It honestly would not have worked as well with anyone else in that role.

For me the best episodes of the series were the beach episode, Steve Carell's final episode, the wedding in Niagra Falls, and the series Finale.  Even in the last two years there was really not a bad episode, although none of them were as good as the show was at its pinnacle (aside from the last few episodes of the series).  I do think they ended the show perfectly, and Steve Carell's very understated two-line cameo was a great way to bring him back, without him dominating the entire show.  It would have been nice to have included him in the final scenes though.

It is important to note that this set is just the individual season sets packaged together.  There are no complete series bonus material.  So if you already own the individual seasons, there is no reason to get this.  The one advantage the physical DVDs have over streaming is you get a ton of extra features, especially in the early seasons.  There are deleted scenes from every episode, and commentary tracks on many episodes in seasons 1 through 7.  All the actors except Steve Carell make multiple appearances on the commentary tracks along with various writers, directors and producers.  The only track that was really bad was BJ Novak and a couple catering people talking about what everyone on set liked to eat.  But otherwise they usually gave good insight into a particular episode or story line.  There were also blooper reels from each season, webisodes which appeared on NBC.com during the series run, and various promos done around the Olympics and Super Bowl.  In season 8 there are the deleted scenes and blooper reel, as well as a half hour long look back at the show with interviews of the cast and crew, as well as casting tapes showing auditions of well known actors who did not get parts on the show and from those that were ultimately cast.  All in all a ton of material for those who like going through all the extras.

Like I said earlier, you likely know by now where you stand with the show.  If you loved it while it was on the air, or just heard about how great it is, but have only seen a couple episodes here and there, this is definitely worth getting.  It is a great comedy that will hold up for years to come.",1431129600,34,3409,4.404153354632588

6506096,5,B00LTO342M,"I'm going to split my review into two parts: the DVD collection and Amazon.

DVD collection: for The Office fans, such as myself, this collection brings a lot of good memories. Starting from the very first season, watching the deleted scenes and listening to the cast/crew commentaries make me fell very nostalgic (in a good way). The DVD boxes are nice and the material superb. Evidently, it could be on Blu-Ray, but that's what we've got!

Amazon: I'd like to share my experience with you. Amazon just provided me one of the most incredible shopping experience of my life. I've bought this collection on March, 27th and, unfortunately, the outside box was scratched and the internal DVD boxes broken (all of them, right where you put your thumbs to open them). I contacted Amazon explaining this unfortunate issue and they promptly sent me a new one. That's the way to treat the customer with respect and care. Way to go, guys!",1429056000,7,929,4.763975155279503

6506099,4,B00LTO342M,"the office in its own right is an amazing show! i grew up with the office and watched it from 7th episode of season 2 live and then onward. I've seen every episode multiple times and will always hold this show to a high standard. my only 'beef' is that the complete series offers nothing else other than the individual season shoved into one box; no added extras, no props, nothing at all. I've bought all the seasons up till 6 cause i knew i was going to want to box set after the shows conclusion so i stopped buying the season sets. well the complete series had released and nothing extra was included and the box is nothing more than a sleeve. another small gripe i have is...blu ray? it seems all the tv shows are abandoning the release of blu ray these days, which to me kinda sucks cause blu ray is the truest resolution. the final nail in the coffin i guess would have to be streaming. Streaming has become the norm and physical releases seem to becoming a thing of the past; this notion makes me believe that this is why all the blu ray tv releases are going away cause people are streaming in HD anyway. NBC's catalog of prime time shows are all on netflix in HD which is great, but how long will that last?",1424736000,3,1217,4.25
6506100,5,B00LTO342M,"I have been a huge fan of THE OFFICE ever since its first season. And, up to and including the very last episode, I am glad I did. The Series was original in its premise and execution, the pseudo-documentary format opening up numerous previously little explored avenues of storytelling. And it was great fun to watch.

The setting (the office of a small branch of paper-selling company) and the stories (everyday life of the people found working in such a low-prospects jobs) seem mundane at first. And there lies the magic of the creators. For (if the endless strings of CSIs are any indication) it not hard to create good TV with car chases, gadgets and explosions. It is extremely hard to make excellent TV with only the everyday grind to work with. It seems effortless only because they made it look easy.

The brief one-way interviews each character had with the camera functioned as either prefatory summaries of stories about to unfold (building up the anticipation) or as instances of pushing back, yet never breaking, the forth wall, and, thus, making the viewing experience more personal and involving. All without the show ever loosing its step.

Producing, directing and writing will only get you so far without the right cast. And THE OFFICE enjoyed such stellar cast. Steve Carell may have risked getting typecast by creating the unforgettable character of Michael Scott but it was worth it. Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) served first as the precarious love interest and then as the familiar friends you care about and the rest of the cast was one successful pick after another. From hypochondriac and hypercritical (not to mention hypocritical) Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to perky Kelly Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), I could not imagine anyone else portraying these memorable characters. However, the show stealer has always been obsessive nerd Dwight Schrute, portrayed to perfection by Rainn Wilson.

Purists and snobs will try to argue that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-precursor-British-Series/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the precursor British Series</a>&nbsp;was better. Strangely for someone who usually finds Hollywood remakes watered down and bland, in this case I strongly disagree. The US version was much better. It had the perfect mix of familiar workday desperation and sweet quirkiness to make it a weekly craved addiction. In contrast, I found the BBC version too mean for my taste. Maybe one should have grown up in a cruel class system carved out by accent hues and prep-school rankings to appreciate it; however, during the handful of  episodes I managed to watch I found myself laughing at the characters, not with them, and then felt bad about it. Anyway, in all honesty, how could Gareth ever compare to Dwight!

The series is unique in another aspect as well: it respected its viewers. Every producer, director and writer wants to make his or hers memorable splash so we often end up with unnecessary cliffhangers, ambiguous endings or unsatisfying closures. Not so with THE OFFICE. No spoilers but I will just state that the show does not disappoint to the very end.

Now, how many reams of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dunder-Mifflin-Premium-acid-free-paper/dp/B006CDW35O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dunder Mifflin Premium acid-free paper</a>&nbsp;should I you down for?",1424044800,29,3433,5.527619047619048
