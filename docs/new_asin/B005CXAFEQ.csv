8466000,4,B005CXAFEQ,"The dvd is a documentary about four people who addict to Halloween. Even after few years later, they still are. They do things that are Halloween relating, like visiting grieves. Of course, They do plans of what they're going to do next year.  If you think you're addict to Halloween, you're not the only one. So watch this documentary.  I brought this dvd so that I can compare  me to them if i'm addict to Halloween or not, which I am, Anyway good film. It was entertaining.",1376352000,2,476,4.448275862068965
