3474494,4,B001AYXFEI,Obviously unrepaired audio for a change. Live shows that sound as good as studio recordings are great but its nice to hear actual performances even if a show full of old material is difficult for either the band or a lot of fans to get real excited about. Seeing them at Glastonbury is weird since the typical Yes crowd is an older crowd that sits instead of this younger crowd that stands. It makes for a different show dynamic. A standing crowd usually expects 90 solid minutes of rocknroll and then there's the fact that a large portion of a festival crowd came to see other performers. The one thing I could have done without was the 30 minutes of interviews taken from the Yesspeak DVD of 03 and interspersed at the beginning of each track of the Birmingham show. The set is identical to the Montreux show from the same tour.,1315267200,8,830,4.467105263157895
3474495,4,B001AYXFEI,"Loved it! The fact that in their 60's these guys can still pull off tunes like ""Long Distance Runaround"", ""Heart of the Sunrise"" and ""Roundabout"" proves that this is and always will be a very special band. Sure Jon Anderson struggled with a couple notes (on ""Don't Kill the Whale"" which is a hard song to sing in your 20's for crying out loud) and Steve Howe just isn't as lighting fast up and down the neck of those vintage guitars as he used to be but watching Rick Wakeman's magic on the keyboards and the ever steady, ever ready Alan White on drums more than makes up for a few bumps in the over all performance. My favorite was ""We Have Heaven"" which I have never seen them do live before and I have seen them in concert numerous times. Good show mates!",1279065600,15,758,4.270833333333333
3474496,4,B001AYXFEI,"Good value for money (2 DVDs set), however, the sound appears to be not the best. Good performances anyway, although, Jon seems to strugle a little bit in some parts. I would have preferred the full concert without interruptions(DVD 1) but I guess there was a reason for it(?).

Personally, Song from Tsongas is one of the best DVD sets, they played songs from many of their albums.

If you are a Yes fan(As I am), buy this for your collection.",1254009600,4,444,4.469135802469136
3474497,4,B001AYXFEI,"First of all, let it be known:  Steve Howe is ON FIRE here.  He deftly moves from one guitar to the next and nails his famous solos (nearly) flawlessly, all while attending to the audience and genuinely appearing to enjoy himself.

Other positives from this DVD:
Great performances  -  these guys may be starting to look their age, but they still rock hard in their inimitable Yes style.
Some different songs that you don't typically hear, and almost all are different ones than appeared on their ""Songs From Tsongas"" dvd from the same 35th anniversary tour.
Interesting stories, backstage footage and snippets of info from the individual band members between the songs.
Disc 2 begins with the best version of ""Awaken"" I've ever seen or heard.  It is special.
Great camera work and professionally done  -  we get close-ups of the performers from all different angles, and just enough of the audience to make you feel like you have a seat at the show.
Rick Wakeman's bank of keyboards has gotten even bigger...  (Is that possible?)

A few negatives:
Audio was slightly out-of-sync in some spots, especially on disc 1.  That's an annoyance.
Drums were mixed very low at the start of the first concert.
Sometimes the volume seems to dampen or compress a bit in spots.

The second disc contains the final 3 songs from the indoor show featured on the first disc, then segues into an outdoor show that has virtually the same song lineup in the exact same order.  I enjoyed this show all the same, as I've never seen them perform outdoors before.  For that show, the camera angles are much more limited, there are a few distractions on stage with roadies moving and checking equipment, and there is some unknown (pretty) woman sitting behind Steve Howe and enjoying the music  -  another distraction for some of us...  (The annoying audience member who insisted on waving his Pink Floyd flag through parts of the show was also a slight negative.)

But overall, you get great performances, excellent sound in most places (but certainly not perfect), and just an enjoyable couple of shows for the Yes fan.  (...and aren't we all?  ;-)",1245888000,54,2125,4.76986301369863
3474498,4,B001AYXFEI,"I am a fan of Peach DVDs, despite the fact that the quality and erotic content runs hot and cold. Some of the DVDs are fantastic, some are a borefest. This one is not the best I've viewed, but its up there. It's basically a ""highlights"" DVD (scenes from other titles), but they choose the hotter scenes / babes. I liked it mainly b/c 1) it features a few of my favs and 2) it edges toward the more explicit end of the spectrum for Peach.

The worst Peach DVDs are the ""above-the-waisters"" where the camera pans away as soon as we get to the good stuff. In this one, we get the lingering ""close-ups"" that (for me) make these things worth while. Topless is cable - the below the belt close-ups make the difference and this one has plenty. And as I mentioned, the DVD has some of my favs - Jamie Lynn is hot, always game, always ""open"" and is naturally busty. Tylene Buck has the body of a female super hero and is also known to get nasty in her scenes, as she does a bit here with another super-busty, hot blonde (Christine?). Teanna Kai is always hot. Alexa Raye may be the hottest babe in adult film and puts on a nice wet show here as well. The other scenes run from ok to pretty good, especially a lithe, busty brunette w/ bedroom eyes who put on a really nice show as well (Karla?).

Bottom line - worth the $ if you haven't seen the other titles (some of these scenes I'd seen before...but didn;t mind so much! If you're looking for something raunchier than Playboy, but not hardcore, Peach is a happy medium.",1242777600,9,1513,4.25
3474499,5,B001AYXFEI,"This is ""thee"" group.

Sure I like the glossed DVD's that are out now with little or no imperfections, everything cleaned up, or dubbed over, or added to, for that better than ""real"" life DVD experience....Who doesn't.

This is not a bad recording by any any means.  This is a great recording.  This is exactly how they would sound if you went to see them live....and that ain't bad.  The 35th Anniversary Tour was too slick (but great!)  Live at Montreux was ""Perfect"".  This is...""Real""  A must add to the YES collection.  This is in the spirit of ""Yessongs"", the record....not the video, but a better recording.

What more do you want!  How many DVD's of this line up are there.",1225843200,25,681,4.545454545454546
3474500,4,B001AYXFEI,I love the double shows. but I don't know if its just me or if its the same on an actual dvd player. sound seemed to be unlevel.. volume raising n lowering throughout. (and unfortunatly disc 2 arrived undocked so it was scratched and messed up durring awaken #2. other than that its a great buy to add to the collection. I'd like to see drama on dvd or this 2008/2009 tour. I hate when rick n jon aren't in the group but still would like access to the shows to experiance their stand-in's. (one as a memory review and one cuz I cant get to it!) how about it guys???? I'll buy them!,1225670400,6,581,4.105263157894737

3474502,5,B001AYXFEI,"There are two complete yesshows in this 2dvd set. Both concerts were taken from Yes' 2003 European tour. The first of the two shows was recorded in Birmingham UK and is mixed with mini interviews of the band and the second is an outdoor show from the Glastonbury Festival. Excellent concerts of progressive rock from the classic lineup of Yes - Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Alan White & Rick Wakeman.  If you like Yes you'll love these dvds.

3474524,2,B001AYXFEI,"I am a lifelong fan of Yes, so I purchased a copy of this set. The performance and setlist are descent, but the mix is so poor, that it is almost unbearable to watch. The drums are practically inaudible, and the only percussion that is present is Jon Anderson playing the tambourine. The sound is simply awful. The outdoor show has much better sound, however, it being a festival and not a ""Yes"" concert so there are a few technical glitches and an occasional mistake. I highly recommend the Montreux show from 2003 if you want a great release from that year.",1434844800,12,559,4.490196078431373

3474526,5,B001AYXFEI,"Steve Howe has done some fine work here. And my idol Jon Anderson is spot-on. These guys perform miracles for my spirit.

3474529,4,B001AYXFEI,"I liked this dvd, but the sound is often out of synch and the volume changes from low to high. It is very difficult to understand how a ""directors cut"" or any dvd of a live performance can be released with such very poor sound quality. It was very disappointing and made the dvd much less enjoyable. Rick Wakeman's solo is incredible on disc 1, as is Steve Howe's. I would recommend it, even with the audio problems. It is surprising that it was released with the audio being so poor.",1416096000,4,484,4.329670329670329
3474530,4,B001AYXFEI,"Sound quality is far better than the ""Live at Montreux 2003"" DVD but still has variations in volume.  There are two shows recorded and both are the same tour therefore the same songs are recorded.",1409788800,,196,4.6
3474531,5,B001AYXFEI,"Perfect  sound,  image  and  info.  This  its  more  than a  concert  video, is a  document of  what  music  really  is. The  inspired  performance  by  all  member  of  the  group  should  be  study  by  music  students. BRAVO!",1402012800,4,228,4.555555555555555
3474532,4,B001AYXFEI,"This is a high-value DVD 2-disc set of two separate Yes shows.  Beyond the obvious low price and ample running time the disc immediately grabs loyal Yes fans as offering a different and unique concert experience.  This is not a super stylized and overly produced presentation of Yes, and it that there is a real treat.  That treat involves a lower-key very relaxed Yes doing what they are masters at.  The camera edits are not the extreme quick edits that induce ""edit-nervosa"" and they feel up-close and more personal.  The sound, while it uses MIDI triggered pre-recorded layered background vocals at times is a no post-corrected affair really showing how the three vocalists of Yes blend their vocals just as you would have heard them had you been there, refreshing and very nice even with a less than perfect presentation.

I feel this is an absolute must for true Yes fans.  The feeling is that you get closer to the music without the over production so no matter how many Yes concerts you may have this one takes it place as a valued addition.  It is the Yes that became the most loved version unless you are just one of those fans who never got over Bruford leaving which for real fans isn't a point to spend any great time pondering.  One thing should be noted and that is the interviews.  The interviews are uniformly enjoyable, but I wish there was an option to play the concert sans the interviews for repeated viewing as once every so often is ample for these segments, but alas there is no way to select them out.  If you're thinking I'll just pass the interview chapters with the next button you'll be disappointed in that as they are not in neat and tidy separated chapters.  Certainly not a pass/fail thing as to buy or not, yet be aware.  So, Yes fans if you haven't purchased this excellent unique Yes concert presentation wait no more.  This is an intimate and very good two Yes shows at an extremely compelling low price.  These guys are my favorite seventies band with original members still performing and this video is a cherished addition to my Yes audio and video collection.",1397260800,8,2100,4.60752688172043
3474533,3,B001AYXFEI,"I found this in the bargin bin and gave it a shot. The music was typicaly good YES but a little lifeless most of the time.

I have loved YES since 1974 and it is great to see them in this manner even though this footage is over a decade old. A lot has changed for them since then. I still morn the departure of Chris Squire from this plane of existence. I'm sure wherever he is, he is laying down some epic bass for an angelic choir.
