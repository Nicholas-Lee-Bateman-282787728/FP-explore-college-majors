7274942,4,B00ZASOJOA,"Well when I heard they were having ANOTHER spin off of CSI i almost had a heart attack! BUT.... This one is pretty darn good! I like that they are getting into th 20th century and going online. I was surprised that i knew most of the definitions at the beginning of the episode.
The characters are great, they complement each other nicely but I was a bit sceptical when i heard Partica Arquette but I was plesently surprised, she is a VERY good actress and the other people complement her to a tee. I also like that they picked actors and acrtresses that you know but they aren't in every motion picture.",1443398400,8,604,4.353982300884955
7274943,3,B00ZASOJOA,This is a good show but I am not going to pay $35 for 13 episode.,1441670400,4,65,3.125
7274944,5,B00ZASOJOA,"This was a mid-season replacement series and we decided to watch it based on the CSI related theme.  Added to that, Patricia Arquette and James Van Der Beek starring in the show really piqued my interest.

The premise of the show is that this is a special FBI team dedicated to solving cyber crimes.  Special Agent Avery Ryan (Patricia Arquette) heads the crew.  She is a former victim of cyber crime involving the theft of information and one of her patients (in her former career) was murdered because of the stolen information.  After that experience, she changed professions, joined the FBI, and has dedicated herself to solving and preventing similar crimes.  Her group is made up of:  Elijah Mundo (James Van Der Beek), a straight arrow FBI agent with an interesting and varied set of CSI skills;  Brody Nelson (Shad Moss) a former black hat cyber criminal who is being given the chance to work with the team and escape his criminal past; Daniel Krumitz (Charley Koontz) an amazingly talented computer scientist who has to work with Brody but doesn't trust him much; and Raven Ramirez (Hayley Kiyoko) another skilled cyber hacker gone straight.  The group liaisons with the rest of the FBI through Assistant Deputy Director Simon Sifter (Peter MacNicol) the guy who is in charge of the group and has to make some hard decisions as to how far they can go in search of an answer.

There are a variety of types of crimes solved in throughout the shows but they all have both a physical and a cyber element.  It seems that the computer work is primarily done by Daniel, Brody, and Raven while the in person and on the ground physical work is accomplished by Avery and Elijah.  While the stories are dead serious, I do get a laugh out of the fact that Avery and Elijah never have to work the protective gear that the rest of the FBI wear alongside them.  Of course, it makes for better television to see the star but I always wonder if a stray bullet might take one of them out.

I really enjoy the show, the characters, and the premise.  One really great thing is that in each show, just as it fades back in from commercial break, a technical or cyber related term is printed on the screen along with its definition.  That way, when the term is used in the show, they don't have to spend minutes explaining it or having it go over the heads of some of the viewing audience.  Both my husband and I have computer backgrounds, so we are familiar with most of the terms; however, the jargon is so rapidly evolving, even we get to learn something new just about every show.

The cast works well together and I was really pleased to see that the show was renewed for another season.  My husband and I both plan to watch the show while it is on.  I highly recommend this season of shows as it gives the background and premise for the series.",1439942400,19,2836,4.491228070175438
7274945,4,B00ZASOJOA,while i do like this show i believe it is a bit misleading... Where it says csi cyber they actually are fbi agents. Other that that i love the cast and the show it self.,1436140800,8,169,3.857142857142857
7274946,3,B00ZASOJOA,"You can't fault the actors , but the writers leave a lot to be desired.
It's kind of a personal drama/ rehab the bad guys/not knowing what to do with it .After watching 2 whole episodes - I wasn't surprised it got cancelled. Mediocre, slightly above average TV, but just slightly.
It proofs that just jumping on the bandwagon doesn't cut the mustard.
Too bad, with just a little better writing effort it could have been a great show.
(By the way I bought the whole thing and did watch it and it did NOT improve past those first two episodes!)",1500163200,,542,4.376237623762377

7274951,5,B00ZASOJOA,It's too bad this was cancelled.  The team of former illegal hackers led by the behavioral psychiatrist played by Rosanna Arquette made up a likeable and believeable group fighting off cyber-threats to our country.  A nice contrast to the typical police procedurals we generally see. Great!,1488585600,2,290,5.282608695652174

7274956,5,B00ZASOJOA,"All the cheese you could ever want.

Rewatch this after watching The Secret Life of Pets. Hear Kevin Hart say ""I feel heroic. And a little wet. But still handsome"" (or approximation of the same) each time James Van Der Beek is on screen. It makes it even better.",1483574400,,262,4.346938775510204

7274961,4,B00ZASOJOA,"I enjoyed this show mostly. There was one show where they shorted a mobile device by attaching it to a car battery, and I wondered by they just didn't take the battery out of the device which would have served the same purpose. Also, there was a statement that whoever carries a gun is crazy, which is crazy talk. The father of the boy making the statement carried a gun, and the character he described as crazy was probably the sanest teenager on the show. Otherwise I enjoyed it, but I see they made several changes in the show for the second season that I may not like.",1479081600,,572,4.305555555555555

7274964,3,B00ZASOJOA,"Patrica Arquette could put a tweeker to sleep. She has one speed and can't convey emotion with her dead eyes and monotone voice. I like the computers subjects but that's the only reason I watch it. There is zero spark between Ted Danson or any of the other cast members and Patricia Arquette, absolutely none. Arquette is like a giant Thorazine lead, she brings any and all excitement to a screeching halt. She's creepy nonemotional",1474070400,,432,4.773333333333333

7274978,5,B00ZASOJOA,"I'm a die hard CSI fan, so a new CSI series was a natural for me.  Well written, great ensemble acting, slickly produced like the other CSI shows--this one instead of centering on a single city is based in Washington DC, home of the FBI (Cyber Crime is federal/FBI domain since by definition it crosses state boundaries), but explores cyber crimes all over the US and the world.  This member of the franchise explores cyber crime both for its entertainment value and for its educational value to the public, and conceives of the fight of good vs evil in this electronic realm as the war of the White Hat hackers (hackers who turn their skills toward fighting cyber crime) against the Black Hat hackers (hackers who engage in cyber crime).  Computer technology is the wave of the future already among us and criminals are as tuned in to exploiting it as any other possible venue, but this realm, to paraphrase the lead character, begins in the mind, is executed in the Net, and realized in the real world.  It points out the frightening vulnerability to hackers and spoilers of our techno devices--the more dependent one is on computer technology, the more devices one relies on, the more open one is to attack by cyber criminals.  The stories found in the news are anticipated and chronicled in this show:  electronic identity theft via social media, computer hacking into pcs and game computers, taking over people's cell phones....  It's fascinating and informative to watch, and scary to think about.  Another nifty spin on CSI.",1456444800,5,1531,4.816793893129771

7274983,5,B00ZASOJOA,enjoyed the episodes and am looking forward to the next season.  sent the dvd's to my son after watching them and told him to enjoy the stories but to pay attention to the technical explanations to actually learn what all the modern tech is about and how easily it can be compromised and the negative things that can happen when it is.  kids have access to all these things but nobody teaches them how potentially dangerous the tech can be if you don't truly understand how it can affect your life.  most people really have no idea. congrats to the show producers for making this series both entertaining as well as educational.,1450310400,4,628,4.589285714285714
