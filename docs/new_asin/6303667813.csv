FALL BRAWL 1995

Spoilers

This was a pretty good event for WCW in 1995. There were some really good matches on this card including a classic between two Horsemen. Plus any time Randy Savage wrestles I love it also who doesnt love War Games.

1. JOHNNY B. BADD VS BRIAN PILLMAN-this was an excellent match, great opening match. These two really put on a show for the fans and gave us possibly the best match of the night. Great back and forth action that goes the distance. But since this was for a shot at the US title there had to be a winner. So the match was restarted. Eventually Badd takes the win in a great opening contest.

2. SGT. CRAIG PITMAN VS COBRA-this match started out with a very cool entrance for pitman and then was a really quick squash match. Pitman takes the easy win here.

3.[TV TITLE]THE RENEGADE VS DDP-despite what some may say I actually liked this match and think it is one of The Renegades best. Good back and forth match with people on both sides getting involved. In the end a Diamond Cutter gives DDP the strap and the win.

4.[TAG TITLE]BUNKHOUSE BUCK & DICK SLATER VS HARLEM HEAT-this was a good brawl between two very tough teams. The action was fast paced and hard hitting. It also continued the love story between Sherri and Parker. The distraction caused by those two during a touching moment the Nasty Boys come out and cost the champs the titles. New champs in the great Harlem Heat.

5. RIC FLAIR VS ARN ANDERSON-the best match of the night as two legends goes at it. The Horseman go to war in one of the best matches of the year. Great back and forth action that sees Brian Pillman costing Flair the match against his best friend. This is an excellent match and recommended viewing.

6.[WAR GAMES]HULK HOGAN, RANDY SAVAGE, STING & LEX LUGER VS KAMALA, MENG, THE ZODIAC & THE SHARK-finally a match with Randy Savage. We get to see Hulks team going to war [hence the war paint and camouflage] against the Dungeon of Doom. It was great watching Randy again here as he went crazy in there. This match also kinda promoted the rivalry with Savage and Luger despite being on the same team. In the end you know Hulks team wins.",1467244800,,2167,4.42713567839196
