7831229,5,6302786851,"Much to my chagrin, Prisoner: Cell Block H went out of print on VHS, well over a decade ago. I can't imagine why, it's a groundbreaking cult hit! It seems they were only available on american video a short while, then became obscure & unattainable. Fortunately I scour around every now & then & discovered the old MPI releases were available from select marketplace sellers, brand new & factory sealed, so I was at long last able to get the episodes I couldn't back then.

The DVD release of sets 1 & 2 only contain select episodes. One of which has episodes 1-4: the beginnning, then skips to a much higher episode number, as they're unfortunately out-of-sequence in A&E's DVD release, so I ordered volume 3, immediately, which picks up where episode 4 leaves off, when Meg Jackson's husband is killed. Volumes 1-6 of MPI became helpful to have in my collection, as volume 3 (episodes 5 & 6), volume 4 (episodes 7 & 8), volume 5 (episodes 9 & 10), volume 6 (episodes 11 & 12)... again, episodes 5-12 are not contained on the DVD, so it makes for a great carry-over & puts the episodes in sequence from those episodes which aren't offered on the DVD sets.

Hopefully, one day Prisoner: Cell Block H will get the correct DVD treatement & some of the other fans will become more vocal in letting distributors know we don't want handpicked episodes out of sequence, we want the proper installments from the very inception of this excellent series. We wants episode 1 right through to episode 692, when The Freak is finally locked up.

I couldn't recommend Prisoner more to fans of good cult tv, or prison drama without all the hype of most american fare these days.",1262822400,,1662,4.589225589225589
