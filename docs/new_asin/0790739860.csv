also the soundtrac of the movie city of angels
and the cd of sarah mc-lachlan with her song in the arms of an angel. if you want to sell it to me jaime63a@hotmail.com",1076371200,2,210,3.9069767441860463
7791537,2,0790739860,"LA confidential is awesome, but I can't really see the logic in packaging it with a bunch of mediocre ""hits"".  City of Angels is not a good movie, and a perfect murder lacks any depth whatsoever.  Contact is interesting, but too slow to hold much interest.  Don't buy this gift set, instead, pick out the movies individually....LA confidential being the best.",1071446400,17,359,4.852459016393443
