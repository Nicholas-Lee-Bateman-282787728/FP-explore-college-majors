8006213,5,B0000A1QO7,This was exactly what we were looking for. It has children interacting with Jim in scenic mountains scenery with songs that teach.  There is dialog with singing and instruction about animal habitat and identification.  The only thing dated is the style of the dvd.  The content and music is relevant and highly recommended.,1523318400,,323,5.056603773584905

Jim's music and environmental message are of great importance to all of us  and to future generations.  This video is beautifully done, fun for kids and grown ups alike.
Thanks Jim for your music and your message.
God Bless you!",1057017600,,350,4.421875
8006215,5,B0000A1QO7,"In a husky voice and a weathered appearance befitting a mountain man of old, Walkin Jim Stoltz takes kids [and adults] on a visual and musical journey into nature as only one who has experienced it can.  With upbeat songs, wildlife in their natural habitats and beautiful mountain scenery, this video makes great viewing and listening.  Our children have watched it countless times and continue to enjoy it, as have we!!",1056931200,,420,4.901408450704225
