4053694,5,B0031Y8018,"I purchased this for my almost 4 year old daughter.  She loved her other Strawberry Shortcake DVD and it wasn't even the new 3D characters.  We've only had it a week and she's asked to watch it everyday.  The DVD also cotains ""A Bery Royal"" Sing-Along and Coloring Pages that can be accessed via computer.  This would be a great addition to any girl's DVD collection.  Especially if she likes Strawberry Shortcake.
In this DVD Strawberry Shortcake & friends are participating in the Annual Spring Festival and Berry Big Parade.  They go through an election process and work through issues when the town becomes divided.  They learn a valuable lesson that everyone must do their part and Strawberry has to step up and lead the way for there to be a successful parade and festival.  The DVD is 64 minutes long and in wide screen format.

4053695,5,B0031Y8018,"Strawberry Shortcake The Berryfest Princess Movie follows Strawberry Shortcake and her community of friends as they get ready for the BerryFest festival. Both Strawberry Shortcake and Orange Blossom are aiming to be elected in order to play important roles in the parade. This movie appears to be aimed towards showing children (in a fun way) the elements of what goes into an election because of the conception around what goes into voting with roles of speechwriter and campaign manager being used in this movie. There are also positive lessons of coming together such as a scene in the forest where Strawberry Shortcake and other members of her community encounter a large beautiful pink bird that needs help in being able to fly. She and her cohorts are faced with the decision of whether or not to feed the bird the nourishing and colorful berry that is traditionally used in the Berry Big Parade and the Festival. The extras accompanying this dvd; A Berry Royal singalong centered around the idea of true friends and printable color pages that can be accessed via a computer cd drive. Then there is a dvd trailer for what looks like the following movie; Strawberry Shortcake The Glimmerberry Ball. From the perspective of an aspiring writer, the Strawberry Shortcake The Berryfest Princess movie gives a story plot angle of the strength in numbers element that can occur when a group of people come together for the greater good.",1437609600,2,1435,4.933884297520661

  We have thrown into the garbage most of the children's programs we have purchased, realizing that they are just teen angst propaganda most likely written by people, however creative and talented, are too bogged down by some current events issue or social club to actually care about the children over their macro-social-schemes or desire to get the next open seat at True Blood's writer's table.  Strawberry Shortcake is a welcomed respite from this ever so prevalent phenomenon, and we welcome it and thank it for its existence.",1429920000,,776,5.126984126984127

4053785,3,B0031Y8018,"My only complaint is the writers always let strawberry shortcake or the lead character win and i am sick of it.  she was allowed to be berryfest princess.  i would prefer the 1st runner up had won but the script was wrote in such a way that she gave it to strawberry.  in another dvd version strawberry did the girls nails in a paint that sings 24 hours a day.  the girls hid it to not hurt her feelings. she found out from her friend and then the girls finally told her. then she did not apologize although she found the singing nails annoying for her early on.  she should have but didn't and the girls ended up apologizing to her quite a bit.

who writes this stuff.  a narcissist who never takes responsibility.  if i go to a salon and get a bad hairdo, i want the person to apologize for hair that glows in the dark and annoys me and my spouse and keeps us up all night...I don't think i should apologize to my hairdressor because i was afraid to say i don't like the hair style due to i may hurt her feelings, that is just normal and we all do that , just a silly example like they did on the dvd ..... they are not teaching the correct messages to little girls at all. enough with strawberry shortcake...i gotta go. happy movie watching young and younger.

P.S. I still like the strawberry shortcake song a lot and some of the dvd's are not so blatantly wrong. I have another dvd Strawberry Shortcake: Puttin on the Glitz in which strawberry does the girls hair and the dryers malfunction and they end up with afros. it is soooo funny to me.",1361318400,,1548,4.220338983050848

4053820,4,B0031Y8018,"My daughter is 3 years old and this is pretty much the only thing besides Little Bear that she will watch from beginning to end. Its oh so girly and colorful. I grew up with the original Strawberry Shortcake and this definately isn't quite like that, but the only thing that matters is that my daughter loves the new Strawberry. This is a very visually appealing movie and the animation is superb. There are a few lessons to be learned throughout the movie, but not much of an ongoing plot. I had no idea that this was actually 4 episodes put together and really it didn't matter because it seemed to mesh well and as long as I can put it on and my daughter is interested, its doing its job. My own opinion is that although I think it can get a little annoying after the 5th time of watching it, the movie is very cute and girly, just what my daughter wants.",1327190400,,858,4.237804878048781
4053821,5,B0031Y8018,This movie is so cute.  I love Strawberry Shortcake and have since I was a little girl.  I am happy that my daughter gets to experience the new Strawberry Shortcake.  I like that there are no bad guys and my daughter loves the bright Colorado used in movie.  It is a win win!,1326326400,,275,4.132075471698113
4053822,4,B0031Y8018,"I was a little disappointed that this DVD is just a couple of episodes of the show put together without the commercials and into a movie format. I wanted to have something ""new"", but we had basically already seen it, with commercials on the HUB...",1325289600,,247,4.511111111111111
4053823,5,B0031Y8018,"My daughter loves this movie. It is one of her favorites, and one of mine also for her. It teaches the ideas of leadership and problem-solving among friends. It is jam-packed with broken down into small easy-to-understand steps of how to solve problems among friends and people you know. No one in this movie ever says anything rude. This makes it appropriate for even the youngest of children, but I think would appeal more to those in the 3-5 age group. I will be getting all the new Strawberry Shortcake movies!",1314057600,,514,4.65934065934066

4053825,2,B0031Y8018,"I was a fan of Strawberry Shortcake as a girl and was excited when they first brought her back a few years ago.  It is nice NOT to have evil villains that are super scary!  This new, new Strawberry Shortcake was disappointing and disturbing.  The girls act and look more like teenagers instead of little girls.  The plot, or lack thereof,  in this movie is just painful!  It is so sad to see yet another character lose their child-like innocence.",1299369600,2,446,4.5125
4053826,5,B0031Y8018,"What little kid doesn't dream about being a princess? Well, I can answer that since my 4 year old son loves this whole series. In fact, he received this DVD for this (Strawberry Shortcake themed) birthday this year. He and his 7 year old sister can be found watching this DVD over and over.

I enjoy this series too. Mostly, the girls are funny, sometimes shallow and sometime emotional but always reminding each other that their friendships are the most important thing. They often tie in themes about respecting one another, working together, friendship and caring.

All 5 characters have different qualities that both of my children seem to enjoy, but mostly Plum for dancing and Lemon for being a little 'flighty'.

I have no complaints about this series, this movie or the most recent redesign of the characters.",1295222400,2,817,4.863309352517986

2 year old niece, she already had a strawberry short cake

Favorite. She likes the whole princess theme since she is
Very much at the dress up stage and considers herself as
A little princess.  A great buy!",1295136000,,317,4.372881355932203
4053828,2,B0031Y8018,"My 2+ year old daughter didn't like this animated cartoon of Strawberry Shortcake as the characters looked different from the original cartoon series. She couldn't recognize Blueberry Muffin and insisted that wasn't her. Also, Pupcake has green polka in this animation, while its blue polka in the original. And they weren't many songs in this animated cartoon. I thought the songs were the main attraction for this cartoon. So, my daughter didn't find it interesting, rather boring with too much dialogue.",1282608000,4,506,5.2592592592592595
