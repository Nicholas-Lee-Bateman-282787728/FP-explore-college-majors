8457248,5,B0055216YW,I found this CD very helpful although it raised a lot of questions that were not answered. It was certainly a good introduction to the D3300 camera for someone who had not owned a DSLR camera before.,1469491200,,199,4.405405405405405
8457249,5,B0055216YW,"As other reviewers have noted, this video is a terrific teaching tool for owners of the Nikon D3300. In my opinion, it is far superior to other DVDs covering this camera. Since equipment models change so often these days, this latest DVD specifically on the D3300 offers all the info any new user could possibly need to produce pleasing photos. The presentation is very professional and the pace is quite brisk, especially for newbies. Virtually every function is explained along with a visual camera demonstration (really helpful). I've viewed this presentation twice and consider this DVD a keeper for as long as I will own this camera -- many years I expect.

I began photography with film cameras years ago as a technical photographer in industry and also shot for a couple advertising agencies. Now as a hobbyist, entering the world of digital photography has been an exciting adventure with many new tools and techniques (l just love Photoshop). Frankly, with digital technology, I'm able to capture much better images much easier -- and create more of them more often. With digital photography now accessible to nearly anyone, educational DVDs like this make creating pleasing photos quite easy...  but we must put in the time and effort to really get comfortable with our equipment. It's not rocket science, but if we want better than point-and-shoot results, we've got to know our gear.

For what it's worth, I can also recommend the following learning resources. Ken Rockwell online offers tons of no-nonsense reviews and info on photography and equipment. Whether you're a beginner or seasoned pro, you'll find lots of very helpful information that will also save you money. In addition, regardless of your camera brand, the Nikon School offers several teaching videos that are worthwhile. Years ago, I attended the Nikon School and it changed my photography forever. On the nikonusa.com website, you can access a couple dozen brief teaching videos -- from setting up and using the D3300 to tips on taking photos & movies. These are particularly helpful for absolute beginners.

All of the Nikon teaching videos are excellent, but I can heartily recommend the following Nikon DVDs: ""Understanding Digital Photography"" and the more advanced ""A Hands-On Guide to Creative Lighting"" (lighting may be the single most important aspect of photography). Bob Krist of National Geographic fame does a superb job of clearly explaining many essential aspects of the equipment, techniques, and basic theory behind taking great photos. I hope this information is helpful and here's to many happy hours shooting pictures.",1456704000,8,2618,5.1674528301886795

8457251,5,B0055216YW,"You are in for a very fast paced learning experience! I suggest you have your camera in your hands when you watch this presentation. It is fact filled and moves along quite rapidly. I have watched it twice so far (and a couple of chapters more than twice). It is very thorough and keeps you from having to read the manual but, please, do not throw your User Guide away either. They contain different ""stuff"" but for me there is nothing like having someone tell you what to do... but then explain why. There's never a dull moment and I highly recommend it!",1397779200,12,555,4.398058252427185
