6305194,5,B00IYJHAWK,"The question you are probably asking is : ""Are these new 2 disc dvd formats better than the box sets?""

The answer is Yes and no. If you want bonus features then you should get the box sets which generally have 4,5 or even more hours of Bonus features on them.

But if you want something that will hold up over time, get this. Not only is it so much cheaper to get an entire season for around $30 than to get a box set at $45-80 or more. But these will not break down. As easily.

What a lot of people don't know or are dissapointed to find out, is that the Box sets has a plastic casing that holds the DVDs in place, and that can break if you take the disc out wrong, and after two or three years the hot glue connecting the plastic disc holder can also come off and you can end up with scratched discs.

These new sets ensure that

1) You have more episodes on each disc so that there are less discs to scratch ( or more episodes to lose if you do scratch it, but that is fixed with point two) and

2) they are held in place much more securely! It's now like a normally two disc dvd.

I do not know whether any others versions of the box sets are better then this though. I have only had experience with the box sets and these.

But I would definitely suggest this over the box set. And if you like these rereleases, than the more you support them by buying them then the more of a chance there is of you getting more of what you want.

I know that this sounds like a sales pitch, but I got all of the box sets of 1-5 and series 5 is the only one which hasn't broken a disc holder. Series four is in complete ruins, and series three is catching up. So I'm really glad that they are doing this!",1400112000,17,1695,3.9472140762463344
6305195,5,B00IYJHAWK,"I can't imagine ever watching a Doctor Who episode and not giving it 5 stars. Without a doubt the 2nd season of the ""new"" Doctor Who is one of my favorites. I wish there had been more shows with the Doctor and Rose.",1398211200,3,215,4.023255813953488

6305198,5,B00IYJHAWK,"I am a huge Doctor Who fan, #10 David Tenant is still my favorite Doctor, but I still highly recommend you start with series one Christopher Eccelston, series 1 rebooted the whole Doctor Who universe. Billie Pipper still the BEST companion IMO. My teenager isn't cool enough to watch Doctor Who, he rolls his eyes when I do, or I talk about it. So he rolls his eyes a lot. I will binge watch Doctor Who a couple of time a year, between series. A show you can easily watch over and over again. Highly recommended, it has time travel, aliens, battles, action, great humor, sarcasm, space travel and much more.",1468713600,2,607,4.4774774774774775

6305205,5,B00IYJHAWK,"When Netflix did away with Doctor Who, this, Series Two Part One and Series Four Part Two were the first three DVD sets I bought to hold me over until there was some news from the BBC. The half-series sets are less expensive than buying the full series sets but it comes without all the special features - probably the only thing that is a downside to the smaller sets. Definitely glad to have this in my collection now.",1456444800,,420,4.329113924050633
6305206,5,B00IYJHAWK,I love David Tennant and Billie Piper! I have always wanted season 2 but other collections were costly. This was the right price and I could afford it.

6305208,5,B00IYJHAWK,"What can I say. It's got David Tennant as the Doctor. It's got Roses last regular episodes which are just fantastic. These half season sets are pretty nice, and a lot cheaper then buying the large box sets. If you don't care about all of the 'behind the scenes' stuf then this is for you.",1447804800,3,288,4.254545454545455
