8259214,2,B0015NQERE,"Narrated by a british narrator, Patrick Allen, this is a good introduction to WWII naval warfare.

Does not do its title justice, I had expected better coverage of exactly what the title says: battleships.  Instead it is really a general narrative of what happened at sea between the warring nations, with a heavy emphasis on german and british navies.  The general posture of each navy is explained taking into account the Washington Treaty, the US' two-sea strategy, Japan's emphasis on carriers (a type not bound by the treaty), Italy's reliance on cruisers, etc.  Nothing in depth, 3 or 4 sentences on each area then it goes on to the next topic.

This video was produced by a british company named Pegasus.  Done competently, they aim at a general public, rather than entrenched, serious followers of WWII sea power. No out of context footage here; when Allen refers to Bismarck, it is Bismarck you see on your screen.  However, to my deep annoyance, there are several quite interesting clips that I haven't seen before where I wish they had spent a little more time, at least tell you what the ship was during which particular action.  Things I remember: a clip of Japanese heavy cruiser Takao, british miniature submarines being abandoned during their failed attempt to sink the Tirpitz, italian cruisers racing towards the british during the battle of Matapan, japanese footage of the sinking of Repulse and POW, although that latter one does show the only faux-pas, that has become almost a cliche, and it consists of a Dauntless supposed to represent a japanese aircraft diving on a target, in this case the Prince of Wales.  I hope I'm not misled but I do think the sinking of the Yamato (from attacking aircraft perspective, of course) and the subsequent pick of survivors, which to me, would be the first time I've seen it.  In general, the time allocated to japanese subjects should have been longer.  And I repeat my main gripe: not enough detail is offered to the viewer and given that the selection of the films is top notch then this fault is that much more glaring.

The quality of the video depends on the source, for example the first 10 minutes show some WWI briefs, and that film is somewhat deteriorated.  More recent footage is better.  The sound on my older TV (Sony of 80's vintage) was awful, it's mono, not stereo.  When I played it on my newer HDTV, the sound improved tremendously but it cannot be called top quality, which is a shame because the classical music used for background is very fitting.

Buy it if you are fairly new or like the subject in general or would like to see some unique footage, such as the sinking of the Graf Spee by its own crew, the process that goes into the firing or main guns aboard an Iowa-class battleship and other little gems found in this film.  However, if you were hoping for more in-depth, or better focused coverage you'd probably be best served looking elsewhere.",1254096000,6,2936,4.714285714285714
