983633,5,6305166013,"I've seen HANSON live before and they rocked. This video brings all those memories back plus, if you were at any of the concerts and didn't get good seats you can see it up close on the video. It makes you feel as if you are  actually there. And the best part is, they cut out all the screaming so you  can actually hear them :)  Ike was so hilarious. I loved the part when Zac  was painting and talking in an English accent. (I want to do  gardening....LOL)",914716800,,458,4.101123595505618
983634,5,6305166013,"I love Hanson and if you do,you'll love this video,it's feels real,hehe. They sing AWESOME, the show was GREAT!! But I think that Tulsa,Tokyo and The Middle of Nowhere was better!!!!I recommend  it to any Fan :o)",914025600,,212,4.72972972972973
983723,5,6305166013,"This is absolutely unbelievbale. It gives you all the behind-the-scenes actions from the '98 Albertane tour, and much more. You can see how they've grown from the first video, Tulsa, Tokeyo, and the Middle of Nowhere. It is  a definant must-have for any fan. Hanson rocks forever!",927331200,5,280,4.957446808510638

983755,5,6305166013,"This video is just like being at a Hanson concert! When i got mine, i RAN home, turned out the lights, turned up the volume, and let it play! From the time the curtian fell, to the clip of ZOE at the end, i was on the edge  of mt seat! Actually I was on the floor jumping like i was at the Hershey  concert! Which BTW there are some clips of the Hershey concert in this Vid  :):):):) Hanson, you rock :p <3",918604800,,406,3.8095238095238093
983756,5,6305166013,"This was the best video I have ever seen, besides Tusla Tokeo and the Middle of Nowhere.",917740800,,88,4.235294117647059
7884760,5,6305166013,"This video is great! So fun to watch. I am only 14, so back in 1998 I was only 4, but I have been a fan ever since '97! I am so glad I was able to buy this...it shows you a lot of performances they did on the Road to Albertane Tour, and every performance was so amazing! The behind the scenes footage is awesome, and you get to see a lot of Zac...which is my favorite part! He's definitely my favorite Hanson. :) Buy this video if you are a fan, you won't regret it! And even if you're not a fan, watch it...you may become one!",1252281600,,527,3.8440366972477062
7884761,3,6305166013,This movie provides a good look behind the scenes of a Hanson concert. Also shows a good tour of the world. Not as good as the concert at the Fillmore but still worth having!,1064275200,,174,4.147058823529412
7884762,5,6305166013,"I didn't get to see Hanson on the Albertane tour of 1998, but it almost doesn't matter cause I have this video. It's a wonderful musical documentary of life on the road and magnificent high-energy performances. The acoustic sets are so beautiful, they give me goosebumps (""Stories"", ""With You in Your Dreams"", ""Soldier""). A must for any Hanson fan collection!",1043971200,,359,5.0
7884763,4,6305166013,"Any fans who attended a show on the Albertane Tour in 1998 will sit through this video, pointing out every time they recognise their show by the clothes the guys are wearing (unlike the Britneys and N Syncs, Hanson don't have costumes on stage, thank god!). For myself it was Toronto (Taylor in white shirt, black pants, same as Zac, Taylor in brown velvet shirt), and not only is this video a great souvenir, but it serves it's purpose for those of you who aren't fans or who didn't attend a concert. Hanson are great live, with only three extra musicians (a bassist, 2nd guitarist, and 2nd keyboardist), who perform songs from all stages of their career, and also the classics that they grew up with (and when I say classics I mean 50's and 60's hits like ""Shake A Tailfeather"", ""Gimme Some Lovin'"", and ""Good Lovin'""!) Apart from the great songs they perform from Middle of Nowhere and 3-Car Garage, there are between segments (as a gift to the fans really) that show Hanson having fun on the road. Memorable is the water fight along the highway between the two tourbuses. Primarily, this video is a fan thing, but non-fans would still enjoy the concert footage (which, unlike some artists' videos, is the focal point of the movie!)",992044800,4,1235,4.6438356164383565
7884764,5,6305166013,"In my opinion it's even better than TTMON, because there's way more music which is what Hanson IS, and some comedy in between (i.e. ""Food, and  CANDY! FOOD, CANDY! FOOD! CANDY!"" lol). If you're the type of fan who  loves Hanson for their music and that's it then I'd recommend this one over  TTMON b/c it's 9/10's live music. And GREAT live music at that!",966643200,5,355,4.430769230769231
7884765,5,6305166013,It gaves me a little bit of want they did on tour because I miss seeing them in 98 when they did the albertane tour so it gaves me a little of stuff that they did on tour I love Hanson so much I am their #1 fan. So I  hope that I can go and see them on tour they are so funny in this video and  they did a great job producting this video it is execllet. I love it a lot  when one of the Hanson brothers b-day I go and put the video in and watch  it I think want they are doing on their b-day so I love it a lot. I love  Taylor and Zac I love Zac glow in dark drumsticks it is so cool I love  Hanson they rock!,959731200,,609,3.408759124087591
7884766,5,6305166013,"This is for every Hanson fan all over the world! Hanson sound great, they are funny, they are on their ""road to Albertane""! It's just like you were at the concert! You will be woowed, you will be speechless, you  will laugh and you will cry! It's all because of this one video! Go ahead  and buy it! You won't regret it!",956361600,,320,4.145161290322581
