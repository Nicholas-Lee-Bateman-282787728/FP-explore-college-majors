8061801,5,B0009J93CS,I fell in love with Pecos Bill when I was very little and that love goes on today.  The problem was finding it in print but now I can share it with others.,1384992000,,155,3.696969696969697

8061804,5,B0009J93CS,"As movies go these days, it DVD's not VHS. But Amazon is the only place I found Pacos Bill, the original release. There are other offers on DVD's but they have been doctored up. I wanted the original 1946 release. Ordering was simple and received on time. The case looks old, but not the movie. If I find a DVD release of the original release, that will be the only time I entend to replace this one, who will be add to my Disney collections.",1318291200,2,442,4.211764705882353

8061806,1,B0009J93CS,"My family and I were so excited to get the original Pacos Bill Show by Walt Disney.  We finally found it here on the web.  Purchased it new (from a 3rd party) for $200.00.  We just couldn't wait to watch this as a family.

When it arrived, it looked like someone had personally shrink wrapped it.  Then, when you open it, the inside label looks like someone has dropped oil on it, there are scratches on the exterior of the cassette.  When opening the tape itself, tape has been bent and there are scratches on the tape.  So, getting pass all of this, we insert the VHS only to find out, the tape will not work, it will not go forward or backwards.  It will not do ANYTHING.  .  We are one of the few families that have both DVD and VHS machines in all of our rooms and not one machine could make this work.

I am so disappointed.  We thought we were getting a NEW, ORIGINAL movie for $200.00.  This leads me to believe this tape in NOT new and has been repackaged and sold as a new tape for a whopping $200.00.  I am not a legal expert, but this appears to be fraud.  WOW.

I am sure this is the LAST thing Amazon wants to hear from a customer.

Still waiting to hear from the third party.  But not happy at this moment.

8061807,5,B0009J93CS,"The best reason to buy this is that you can't get the uncut version of Pecos Bill anywhere else. This has the complete story in it's original unedited version. The When Michael Eisner was still at the studio,  this film was subjected to some editing for its newer release. For example it was decided that that Pecos did not need his cigarette and they digitally edited it out of all new releases of this classic. On principle I recommend you do not buy edited version of Disney classics and only buy this old one to send a message about censoring vintage Disney cartoons. In the meantime tell Disney Studios to restore this classic to its unedited original condition. It is a fun film, and it did not glamorize violence or smoking so there was not a need to do this. Great tall tales on this tape with fun music. If Disney reissues an unedited version on DVD, I will post an update here. As of January 1010, they have not done so yet. Of course that has pushed the value of these old VHS tapes up quite a bit for collectors.",1129680000,20,1024,4.361256544502618
