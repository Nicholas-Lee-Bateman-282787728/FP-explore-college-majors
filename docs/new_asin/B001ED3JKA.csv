3549751,1,B001ED3JKA,"Seriously, save your money or burn it(at least it will create a little warmth.)  I bought this thing for its nostalgic value but I believe it may be the very worst video transfer I have ever bought.  The sound is blurry and in some cases, it is downright unintelligeable.  I haven't even opened the 2nd and 3rd discs.  I just put them all on the shelf and resigned myself to the fact that this is 15 bucks I'll never see again.  The industry in general goes to great lengths to make sure you don't return a movie after the package is opened.  I'm guessing they get a pretty good chuckle when they sell a disc like this and know the money is theirs to keep.  Pay attention!  Don't buy it!",1350950400,10,687,4.230769230769231
3549752,2,B001ED3JKA,"Even tho I know what Alpha Video releases can be like I was taken aback at the sheer awfulness of the quality of all these 15 eps on 3 DVD's. Other reviewers have commented on the sound as being bad. I couldn't understand any of it on some episodes. The picture is barely watchable but with the appalling soundtrack I feel like returning the lot, as I honestly can't watch any more eps, (I have only watched i in entirity and gave myself a headache, then I checked at random 7 more eps, and gave up) and as a ""wannabe"" fan of Irish I am very upset. Words aren't minced here as I feel other potential buyers should be aware. If you must see for yourself, get 1 volume and check it out, not all 3 as I stupidly did. As a footnote I should add that some of Alpha's releases are OK, but boy you takes yer chances. Oh, and the series looks as tho it might (might) have been fun, so 2 stars, just for that and, as another reviewer said - ""For Irish"".",1330041600,3,944,4.080645161290323
3549753,4,B001ED3JKA,"Despite occasional hokiness (hey, it was filmed in 1956) and definite Political Incorrectness (ditto), this short-lived (26 episodes) early TV series features, in its beautiful, athletic, and extremely competent heroine, a role model who doubtless inspired many a little girl, 12 or 15 years later, to throw herself headlong into Women's Lib.  Sheena (Irish McCalla) is a hybrid of Tarzan and every ""white queen of the jungle"" ever to grace the pages of the pulps; barbaric in a brief leopardskin tunic, metal armbands, fancy earrings and a bangle, famous ""from Nairobi to Cape Town"" (though she lives mostly in the Kenyan uplands), respected (and sometimes feared) by every tribe in her orbit, she runs barefoot through the jungle, swims crocodile-infested rivers, swings gaily through the trees on vines (McCalla famously did all her own stunts till one of these flights netted her a broken arm), overpowers men half again her weight, and, with the help of her friend Bob Rayburn (Christian Drake), a guide and white hunter, and her Faithful Anthropoid Companion Chim the chimpanzee, helps safaris in trouble, pursues fugitive criminals, prevents the exploitation of the natives, and deals with bad guys of all hues and persuasions.  Though McCalla claimed she ""couldn't act,"" she manages to bring the character to life--watch the grace and dignity in her walk (queenly indeed!) in some of the shots.  It's true that the picture and sound quality aren't all that could be hoped for--sometimes the brightness is too much, and often the soundtrack is uneven--but given that TV technology was still in its infancy at the time, we should probably be grateful to have it in any condition at all.  This collection includes 15 of the original episodes; we can hope that the remaining 11 are available to the manufacturer and will appear in forthcoming volumes.

3549754,1,B001ED3JKA,"The picture is trembling and very contrasted or fuzzyness. The sound is very bad, inaudible sometimes. I'm very disappointed. Irish McCalla deserved better!",1267747200,11,156,5.826086956521739
3549755,4,B001ED3JKA,"I suspect this set will appeal mostly, if not solely, to ""old timers"" (such as myself), as a sort of trip down memory lane; younger audiences are likely to enjoy it only, if at all, as high camp.
Leave us face it: except for the late Ms. McCalla (her looks, not her acting skills), the series was unspeakably bad: plots, writing, dialogue, direction, acting, production, you name it. However, it is not without historical significance. For one thing, it was, to the best of my knowledge, the very first action / adventure TV show to star a female character, just as the comicbook Sheena had been in that medium in 1938, predating Wonder Woman by three years. Also, it debuted in the US in September 1956, with the Hayes code still going full blast and not long after the apex of McCarthyism and the witch hunt on comics that had put an end to Sheena's career on the printed page and all but doomed ""jungle girls"", the until then highly popular subgenre she begat, to extinction. So, in a way, the (short-lived, one single 26-episode season) series was a breakthrough.
As for the product: image quality is good, given the material's age and origin, with only a few occasional lines here and there. Sound, on the other hand, is disappointing, muffled throughout and all but unintelligible in some episodes; sound quality on the older releases on VHS was actually better. Packaging is rather rushed: next to no information, episodes are not in chronological (airdate) order, and the order on the boxes does not necessarily match that on the discs.
Based on content and product, the set rates a two out of five. Irish alone adds two more stars to it.",1259366400,16,1646,4.679310344827586
8297807,1,B001ED3JKA,"I enjoyed reading all the well deserved scathing reviews, except that they weren't scathing enough to mention one more point. Buy all these volumes and you're still missing several episodes of the 26. Buy the recent combination Sheena 2000 series+1980s movie+1955 sample episodes set and you're still missing several episodes even when you combine it with this one. Why is 1950s television always treated with such contempt? Save your money and petition the owners of this show to put it out properly.",1507075200,,501,5.121951219512195

8297814,2,B001ED3JKA,"While the packaging looks terrific, the picture quality is uneven and often not very good.  You will be very disappointed trying to watch these episodes on a big screen TV.  However they don't look so bad on a smaller screen like a 15.6 inch laptop screen.  If you were a fan of these shows and Irish McCalla you can only hope that a better version of these PD shows in a restored version become available someday.  But for now these are probably the best you can get.",1427760000,4,468,4.344827586206897

8297816,1,B001ED3JKA,"I was very disappointed in the 3 discs, and ended up throwing them away.  Funny, I did not remember what a terrible actress Irish McCalla was.  Pretty, but stiff as a board.  And these copies of the TV show episodes were so dark and murky as to be almost unwatchable.  Pick something more fun from that era to watch, maybe a few ""Republic"" serials.",1366761600,3,348,4.390625
