But I decided I simply had to review this flick from Russia because the whole thing just amused me. You see this film looks like it had two budgets. The first budget they used to pay for the costumes for the final battle during the last five minutes of the movie. And the rest of the movie looks like it was made for about 25 roubles.

This film - which not unreasonably seems to take some cues from the Alexander Nevsky film of the 30's - tells the tale of our hero and his earlier exploit which was a victory over the Swedes. It goes for quite some time and doesn't seem to stay terribly focussed. The amateur acting, stilted line delivery and the overall feel of the movie all adds up to a fairly lacklustre cinematic experience. The production values are OK I guess, but the story seems to feel obliged to cram a certain number of things into the movie regardless of how much sense it makes. If you are looking at this show you'll almost certainly be familiar with the Alexander Nevsky movie I mentioned earlier and suffice to say that is superior in every way, the only actor who seems to have any real presence on stage is the lad playing Alexander himself. At least you looks like he has some physicality about him. Not that you'd know since apart from a murder scene there are really only two action sequences in the film, one at either end, and the rest is dialogue mostly.

And here is the clincher. The entire thing is in Russian only. Now I actually prefer to watch a film in it's original language and read subtitles, it adds to the flavour. But where the problem becomes insurmountable here is that the subtitles are rubbish. Some of the words used in the subtitles aren't even in English but instead seem made up. In fact they've made no attempt to translate the bulk of the dialogue. And what is translated still doesn't make sense. It's like somebody got a Russian-English dictionary and translated some words literally. So you can't really follow a lot of the conversations. And - presumably to save money - they've made the movie largely about dialogue.

Hilariously, my copy had a problem during the battle scene. After wading through 1hr 40 mins of difficult to follow botched subtitles I thought I was at least entitled to a battle scene! But truth to tell that's not the films fault and the fight scene is OK. I mean it is a welcome distraction. As was the photo of Charlton Heston from his role in the movie El Cid that was used on the rear cover of my copy. And no... he ain't in the film!

A bizarre situation of a film - I am definitely going to inflict this onto my brother at some point! Two stars for this film for the way it tries so hard with so little and the way it left me scratching my head so often.",1271376000,2,2760,4.361867704280155
