8499532,5,B006JN87K2,"Brilliant Nova FUN documentry about how to blow things up!  Ha!  Plus the fascinating historical details and significance, make for a truly wonderfully entertaining 2 hours.

Perfect for anyone into mechanical engineering, heavy equipment, important WWII turning points, or cool geeky was to blow things up.",1515628800,,307,5.630434782608695
8499533,5,B006JN87K2,"An excellent supplement to the classic WWII movie, ""The Dam Busters"", this one shows the complete process of trying to retrace the steps of the engineer Barnes-Wallis in his attempt to make bombs that could and did break some of the biggest dams in Europe.  The movie dealt with both the engineering problems and the actual mission to bomb the dams.  This documentary redoes both of those things.

Much of the original diagrams and notes are gone, so the engineers had to redo many of the experiments, study the films (there is a lot of original footage made by Barnes-Wallis et al) and try to guess what they did.

They made some changes, mostly for safety reasons.  But they did have a smaller dam built, did skip the bombs off the water to land beside and sink up against the dam and they did emulate the real explosion by setting off a charge under the water -- you're not allowed to drop a real bomb in Canada or much of anywhere anymore unless you're with the military.

You will see a lot of the engineering here, far more than in the original movie (though that too was very good).  If you like to see engineers in action and aren't an engineer, and/or if you want to know more about that bombing raid, this is a good place to turn.  The engineering is just enough for amateurs like me to understand it just a little bit better.",1422662400,,1336,4.402439024390244
8499534,5,B006JN87K2,"A Cambridge professor recreated how these bombs were designed and dropped from Lancaster bombers to destroy 2 huge dams in Germany in 1943...
a dam was purpose built in Canada ... a vintage plane was used to drop the newly designed bouncing bombs ... it was exciting and interesting especially towards the end when all his hard work paid off... a piece of history was successfully recreated.
My husband is an engineer ... maybe that's one of the reasons we found it so interesting.",1401753600,,481,4.738095238095238
8499535,1,B006JN87K2,"It seemed kind of cool since I do like history but ""Chuck Adams"" ruined it for me.  He is so hmm, plain and boring when it comes to any type of object thrown with enough force skipping across water.",1386115200,,198,4.076923076923077
8499536,1,B006JN87K2,"An absolutely banal, pointless exercise in backward engineering.

Put another way, can you imagine a 112 minute film about some art students tracing the Mona Lisa - saying, ""Well, we don't know how Leonardo did it, but we can use a lot of grant money and modern technology to reproduce the Mona Lisa on a 1/4 scale?? And then mugging, ""What a good boy am I !""  Wallis did it 70 years ago with ""stone knives and bear skins"".

Better to watch the excellent 1955 ""The Dam Busters""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dam-Busters/dp/B000H1RFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dam Busters</a>&nbsp;- and that in only 105 minutes!

""Bombing Hitler's Dams"" is a ludicrous film.",1373068800,2,706,5.632075471698113

8499538,5,B006JN87K2,"THIS DVD CAME ON TIME, IN GOOD SHAPE, AND A FAIR PRICE. DVD PLAYED WELL AND IT HAS A GOOD STORY TO TELL....",1338076800,,107,3.6956521739130435
8499539,4,B006JN87K2,"At first glance it seems this story has been done before. The title implies that the film will be about bombing German dams in WWII; but most of the time is devoted to the building and reenacting of what the 617th Squadron accomplished. There are some period films and reenactments, especially of the experiments leading to this dam buster bomb.
It seems that the plans for this bomb have been lost, so a Cambridge professor decided to try to recreate how these bombs were designed and dropped from Lancaster bombers. He cannot drop explosives from air, so has to substitute weighted canisters and has to use a DC4, and build a scale model of a dam in Canada.
The information concerning the British engineer Barnes Wallis and how he solved all of the involved problems: overcoming bomb/torpedo nets, getting a bomb to bounce - using a 400 year old idea that ship's gunners used with cannonballs and then get the bomb explode under water where the effect would be greater, the height and how to allow the bombers to know the altitude they were flying are all excellently done.

Where this DVD starts to get a bit tedious is in the modern day experiments. We see his solving the bouncing problem, but then the testing in dropping from an airplane becomes monotonous, with the exception for diehard bombing aficionados. The plane flies again and again, at different heights, with and without the bomb. One just wishes for a summary and then to get on with it.
At 2 hours this is a drawn out program that would have been extremely more effective at 90 minutes. But it is still an interesting experiment and education of a fascinating part of WWII history.",1331337600,6,1651,4.673539518900344
