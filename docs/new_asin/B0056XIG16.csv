8459948,4,B0056XIG16,"Laker Power (Dominick LaBanca) comes to earth to visit his brother Johnny (Dennis Keiffer) who was killed. Johnny was not well liked and he was a ""junker"" a member of a fight club, but one that everybody talks about.

Laker is taken in by some Junkers as he trains and fights in hopes of figuring out who killed his brother. One of the guys (Harold Hazeldine) has a girlfriend (Pamela Pond) who works at a strip joint, so some of the non-action takes place there, as Laker asks Slick (Kisu) ""Is this part of my training?""

The science fiction aspect of space travel really didn't play into the film, other than Laker was an outsider. It felt like aliens in an Indian Jones film. The film used Kick boxing and Tae Kwan Do champions and fighters to be in the film, making the fighting more realistic, but still using slow motion and fake hitting noises to enhance the entertainment value.

While the fighting looked real, Kisu couldn't deliver a line to save his life and Dominick LaBanca wasn't far behind him. The support cast was a bit better with Harold Hazeldine exhibiting personality beyond that of a meat head fighter.

Worth viewing for what it was... 3 1/2 stars.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Pamela Pond, Christina Veronica, Monique Parent and Playboy's Mary Varela- FF)
