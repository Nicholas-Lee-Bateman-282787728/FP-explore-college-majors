5261361,5,B0094GUO20,"dvd quality is excellent and this is a great detective series.  love the characters, casting and acting.  realized sally wainwright is the co-creator/writer of the show and then, the light went on..... of course i love the characters and stories, i could see similarities between them and another favorite series of mine....last tango in halifax, created and written by sally wainwright.  in fact an actress in one of the stories is a lead in last tango.  if you enjoy british detective shows, this one won't disappoint.  and if you buy a reasonably priced all region player on amazon like i did, you won't have to wait for region 1 formats any longer, you can bounce back and forth between the regions with no problems.  also, the region 2 dvds are sometimes offered for less and the quality is excellent.",1415318400,,806,4.762589928057554

5261366,2,B0094GUO20,"Realized after purchase it was a format not suitable to Canada.  Tried to cancel it a few hours later but it had already been shipped.  As per on-line instructions we refused delivery by the courier service.  However we never received a refund for it.  E-mailed your office today re this and within a few hours we received an e-mail back saying the refund has been put through.  We are very happy with the outcome.  Excellent service.

We have another order that we made Dec. 3 (Scott & Bailey DVDs) that we will not receive by Christmas.  All along you have been forthright in saying you will notify us by e-mail when you have stock.  It would be nice to have a rough idea when you expect shipment as we will have to give a piece of paper to a relative with no estimate of arrival time at all. Thank you.",1387238400,,805,4.3133333333333335
5261367,5,B0094GUO20,"This is an absolutely fantastic series. The female character leads are complicated and extremely likable.  I have looked forward to this on PBS, but did not get all of the back storys to fill out the characters...now I have that.",1385164800,,229,4.725
5261368,5,B0094GUO20,"I really like this series.  I saw a few episodes first on PBS and then decided to look for the entire season.  I was not disappointed.  I believe it requires an all-region DVD player, but I found one on Amazon that wasn't expensive.",1380412800,3,232,4.348837209302325
5261369,5,B0094GUO20,"Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey are detective constables in a special branch of the Manchester police.  Janet is mid-late forties (over the three seasons) and Rachel is in her early thirties.  Janet is grounded and Rachel is (in her private life) hyperbolic verging on crazy, particularly in the third season.  Each reflects the personality of their respective mothers.  While Janet has passed her sergeant's exam there are no vacant DS positions.  She is a longstanding friend of their DCI--Gill Murray.  (The `Gill' is pronounced Jill.)  While Janet and Rachel are the principal characters in the stories, Gill is a very close second.  She is crisp, disciplined and no-nonsense, with a salty tongue and a capacity to deliver staccato dialogue which is nearly Shakespearean in its wit, speed and cleverness.

The personal lives of the characters are as important as the crimes which they solve, the personal lives constituting a continuing subplot (or is it the primary plot?)  In the third season there is a continuing story line that cuts across all eight episodes.  It has been compared with other continuing crime dramas such as the very popular series, Broadchurch.

The stories are gory, quirky, and as violent as one might expect Manchester capable of providing, but the key elements of each story tend to be the `interview' sessions which Janet and Rachel conduct with the suspects, perps and persons of interest.  These are not high-pressure interrogations, but quiet, calm, methodical `interviews' which end up being devastating in their orderliness and effectiveness.

The writing is excellent throughout, the atmospherics very good, the performances consistently superb.  This is British crime drama of a very high order.  It has an obvious female inflection, but the females in this unit command male respect and do things in a way that capitalizes on female strengths and results in the bringing down of bad guys in a slightly more delicate but no less definitive manner.

On a more mundane note, the episodes are approximately 45 minutes in length--perfect for quick viewing.

Highly recommended.",1379980800,7,2110,5.210682492581602
5261370,5,B0094GUO20,"There have been so many TV series featuring police investigative work produced over the years that it is extremely difficult to come up with something which is sufficiently different to be memorable. Frankly most of the offerings seem almost to just merge into one. However, the writers of Scott and Bailey have succeeded with a formula which is sufficiently novel to grab the attention and leave the viewer keen for more.

The series features two overworked detectives from the Major Incident Team (MIT) of the Manchester Metropolitan Police - Janet Scott and Rachel Bailey. The show features both their professional lives and their personal lives, both of which they live at something of a frenetic pace and which, to some extent, compete with each other. Janet is the older and steadier police office whose personal life has its share of crises. Rachel is younger and more impetuous, but often comes up with the leaps of imagination which solve cases. Needless to say, her private life is complicated to say the least. In the very first episode of Series 1, she has just discovered that her lover of two years' duration is married with children - just how she have overlooked this fairly significant fact given her detection skills is far from clear!

Janet Scott and Rachael Bailey are very capably acted by Lesley Sharpe and Suranne Jones. Amelia Bullmore plays DI Murray who is their superior officer, and is a very effective counterfoil to the two ladies and an essential part of the chemistry of the series. She plays an increasingly important role, particularly in Series 2. The interaction between Janet and Rachel works very well. Although best friends, it is a far from frictionless relationship, but is very effective in terms of solving the crimes they are faced with. One criticism of this series has been that the men in it vary from being non effective to complete wallies. However, personally I found the performance of the three leading ladies sufficiently interesting that this was not an issue for me.

So far we have 14 episodes of Scott and Bailey, six from the first series and a welcome expansion to eight in the second. Series 2 certainly kept up the high standards of Series 1 and finished on a very dramatic note. Hopefully we will have plenty more in the future so that they will be part of our television viewing for years to come, and this will be the first of many box sets.",1363651200,9,2406,4.778846153846154

8535878,5,B0094GUO20,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014.

The two detectives and their female, DCI, Gill Murray played by Amelia Bullmore are clever and the scripts they are given are intelligent and witty. The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience.

Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, she drinks too much and takes risks, her brother moves in with her. He has a criminal record and Bailey's DCI would not be happy to know this. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and a husband who is boring, and it seems separation is the name of the game. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 2, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim. Scott and Bailey work as a team most of the time, but they have their differences. Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes not to be called into DCI Gill Murray'S office. Didcipline and excellent police work is the word if the day- good series.

8535879,3,B0094GUO20,"The description advertised for this movie series, leads the viewer to believe that this series was very exciting. Alas!  it was not exciting. In the series  two protagonists, do not look like they do on the packaging/cover of the CDs. The story lines are  very predictable, and somehat boring. I have yes to finnish watching these CDs.

If there was a way for me to return the item, I would.",1468022400,,391,4.542857142857143
8535880,5,B0094GUO20,This is yet another BBC series that I find compelling:.it goes in depth with the lives of two very competent police women. And they happen to be friends who are often at odds with each other. The characterizations are exceptional. BBC has a knack for great series such as Downton Abbey.,1439337600,,286,4.627450980392157

8535882,5,B0094GUO20,"This is the absolutely fantastic 2011 and 2012 series from ITV1.  The idea came from two Corrie stars, Suranne Jones and Sally Lindsey;  it's brilliantly written by Sally Wainwright (Last Tango in Halifax.)  Suranne (Dead Clever, Single Father, A Touch of Cloth and Unforgiven -- the mini-series not the Eastwood film) also stars in this with Lesley Sharp (Clocking Off, Afterlife) as the likeable leads.  Lesley's real-life husband, Nicolas Gleaves, is also a key member of the syndicate.  Kevin Doyle features in several episodes as a character far removed from his Mosley in Downtown Abbey.  And, Sally appears in series 2 as Suranne's sister.  The stories are a good mix of interesting crimes and personal lives.  The calm, devastatingly effective questioning techniques make a refreshing change from the norm.
I scream when shows are given poor ratings or people complain about clearly advertised Region 2 format.  BUY A REGION FREE DVD PLAYER and expand viewing options; Samsung sells an excellent one for about $40.
This is definitely one of the best current series; it's great to watch entertaining stories and good actors who look like average people instead of plastic beauty queens.  I've already ordered series 3 and 4.",1426032000,,1231,5.14070351758794
