He grinds his teeth as he collects his pay for military service in WW2, then is told he must wait to get a passport to re-enter France. Cut to Powell in a boat off the French shore. He stands, wraps a Luger in plastic, shoves it into his coat, then sinks his boat and swims to land.
Why? We come to find out that his French war bride of 20 days was killed by a Vichy officer, who since died himself. But Powell ain't buying it, and follows his cold trail all the way to Buenos Aires, where exists a dangerous underground full of Nazis and collaborators scheming to rise again.
This film is rather unusual in that it makes the point Powell doesn't really have all the answers. He knows he may be going about things wrong, but he doesn't much care. He's not smug like Cagney, not smart like Bogart, and he has no legal authority. All he has is his instinctive, righteous anger. Hence the title: he fights like a wounded, cornered animal.
Many of the filmmakers, including director Dmytryk, were blacklisted later on, and there is indeed a definite tinge of, shall we say, pink, to the proceedings. And the subtle, flawed argument put forth blames a percieved moral laziness in capitalism as much as it blames fascists for fascism's rise. But ignore all that rot; the diatribes and revelations come mostly in a talky finale where the killer is revealed before Powell finally gets his chance to knock the schweinhundt on his axis. The majority of the film traces Powell all over an exotic city in an uncertain time.
Well-acted, well-scripted and well-directed, maybe 10 minutes overlong, the film manges never to lag, even in the static scenes. While not really suspenseful per se, Cornered still grabs the viewer with sympathy and quiet intensity and perhaps even a bit of vicarious blood lust. Powell intimidates who he must, wines and dines who he must, avoids frame-ups, tricks people with phony documents, shadows duplicitous femmes, and endures numerous sappings, all in order to get his man.
One great scene involves him telling a drop-dead gorgeous dame of his wife: his undying love is clear even as he describes her crooked teeth and how she was too skinny. And when he eventually turns down-even mocks- the babe's sultry invitations, it becomes clear: Powell is on a mission, and until it is completed, he is untouchable.
A noteworthy Post-war achievement. Not as well-known or highly-regarded as The Third Man or Notorious, but roughly similar to each, and for my money it is better than either, in its own small way.
Other assorted comments:
RKO programmers like this one are revered (at least by me) for their great dialogue. And there is a bit of that in this film, too. But it is largely of a different type than Out of the Past or The Big Sleep; more fluent and less slangy. Politely hard-boiled, if you will.
Dick Powell was (and remains) a very under-rated performer. His films of the 40's and early 50's are great because he went out of his way to undo his softer image formed in 30's musicals. See this film and Cry Danger, then compare them to Gold Diggers of 1933 and Blessed Event. Apart from his vaguely frog-like appearance around the mouth, you'll hardly believe they're the same guy.",1022112000,19,3306,4.691910499139415

7810899,5,6301327683,"This is the  New Dick Powell. No longer the juvenile crooner of the early thirties or the good natured singer of the late thirties and early forties, this is the tough Richard Diamond and Richard Rogue of  radio and the first to play Philip Marlowe (as a character by that name) in  1944 on screen. Here he plays a Canadian Airman in World War 2, who has been invalided out of service (the film was made in 1945, the year that the war in Europe ended with the German surrender) and now is seeking the Nazi killer who  was responsible for the murder of his young French wife during the War. The trail leads him the Argentine where it is rumored the Nazi is hiding (as so many Nazi's were). As was typical for characters of this type in films, he is beaten up, knocked out, the object of seduction efforts, of the verge of death through shooting by nasty types as the film unfolds. He does quite a realistic job which clearly satisfied the powers that be who gave him the chance at tough guy roles thereafter. He is supported by a bevy of more than ordinarily competent male character actors who give the film its flavor. These include Walter,  the son of the outstanding German classical tenor, Leo Slezak, Morris Carnovsky, Steven Geray, Jack LaRue (now remembered for his appearances with Mae West and the Marx Brothers, among others, and Luther Adler in a shadowy bit part. The film has lost nothing of its virtue over the years, no doubt, in part, due to the direction of Edward Dmytryk and the screenplay for which Ben Hecht shared credit.",1418601600,,1543,4.496428571428571

7810901,4,6301327683,"Just in case them movie theater audiences back in 1944 thought that Dick Powell was merely flirting with film noir in MURDER, MY SWEET, the ex-crooner speedily followed that up in 1945 with another gritty suspenser, CORNERED. Powell plays electrical engineer Laurence Gerard, recently of the Royal Canadian Air Force and newly released from a P.O.W. camp. Gerard from jump exhibits a sense of urgency. He's got things to do, vengeance to wreak. He sneaks into France, obsessed with learning who murdered his French wife, who was a Resistance fighter during the war. Gerard is directed towards Vichy collaborator Marcel Jarnac as the prime suspect. Except that Jarnac is believed to have died. Gerard doesn't buy it. A clue points him to Argentina. In Buenos Aires the plot thickens.

At this stage, in 1945, folks were finally become aware of Powell's shift from song & dance to hard-boiled intrigue. CORNERED earned more in the box office than did MURDER, MY SWEET, a Powell starrer that had people scratching their heads and probably asking, ""What the hell kind of musical title is that?"" In CORNERED Powell's character isn't savvy like Philip Marlowe. In Buenos Aires Laurence Gerard continues to demonstrate his lack of subtlety. A man possessed, Gerard prowls like a caged tiger, and it still must've been a jarring sight, seeing Powell scowl and grimace and surly up the place. He threatens and bullies and shadows his suspects, and by ""shadows"" I mean he stalks them in plain sight. His recklessness costs him frequently. It earns him lumps. In the end his persistence pays off. But it's not because he's clever enough to figure things out. Rather, certain parties have opted to use him as a stalking horse.

Still, he checks all the boxes required of a film noir male lead. He projects melancholia and a deep cynicism but remains, however tarnished, a good man seeking justice (okay, sometimes, ""justice"" is just ""revenge"" being polite). He's tempted by not one but two lovely femme fatales (Nina Vale and Micheline Cheirel). And when called upon, his tough-guy patter stands up to inspection. When one character tries to reflect on his own woes and how a family tradition had been sullied, Gerard impatiently cuts him off: ""I've got a tradition, too. As far back as I can remember, the men in my family have gotten mad when their wives were murdered."" That sort of shut the other guy up.

CORNERED cements Powell as a relevant figure in film noir. His coiled spring performance propels the narrative, informs the mood. Also outstanding is Walter Slezak who exudes an oily craftiness and, in his white duds, looks like a more svelte Sydney Greenstreet. Slezak plays the neutral ""professional guide"" Melchior Incza who may (or may not) be sympathetic to Gerard's cause. He provides signposts in Gerard's search for the elusive war criminal Marcel Jarnac, a search which will unearth an underground network of Nazis. And we know how we feel about those guys. They made goose-stepping really unpopular. On the other hand, geese everywhere are probably grateful. So, to show your appreciation of geese, go see CORNERED. Dick Powell is really good in it.",1352592000,,3157,4.952830188679245
7810902,5,6301327683,"Say a guy, maybe a guy who was a ""premature"" anti-fascist and fought in Spain in the 1930s, maybe not, but who did his bit, did his soldier bit, against the Nazi hordes trying to run over Europe, took a couple of hits for his efforts, one his own when his plane fell down over France, the other when his wartime bride, a French Resistance fighter, was executed by some bloody Nazi collaborator, a Vichy snitch felt he had to do something, something to get even after the war would that be alright?  Everybody would say sure, hey, a guy is supposed to do something when his wife is murdered right. And so he does, not out of some big political motive to rid the world of Nazi scum, not to get even for the million crummy things that happened in Europe (and elsewhere) during those dark night World War II times but to even up the score on his wife. Even if they had only been married twenty days, she had crooked teeth and was too thin. The Nazis and their collaborators weren't worried about short married lives, worried about fixing a resistance fighter's crooked teeth or her weight problems, no way, just are you with us or them. And with them meant you were on short rations and short lives. But still a score needed to be settled and our soldier boy (Dick Powell) was just the boy to square things up in his own way.

But the trail was cold, the snitch dead, or supposed to be, and the prospects of getting from England to immediate post-war France to pick up the trail before it got colder through official channels was unlikely. So our intrepid soldier improvised, worked his way around channels (literally and figuratively) just because, well, because he has a hunch, a hunch is all, that things didn't stack up. And they didn't. They didn't stack up in France where the snitch covered his tracks with a too pat staged death paper trail, they didn't stack up in Switzerland where the snitch's widow was allegedly ""grieving"" (and getting hubby's insurance dough), and they didn't stack up in Buenos Aires where she had flown the coop and where ex-Nazis, their collaborators, their wives, lovers, acolytes and their juts defeated idea were entirely welcome.

Our boy will get many frequent flyer miles before he is through but he winds up in sunny, decayed, decadent Argentina as he circles in for the kill. And he does after plenty of misdirection (provided in part by Walter Slezak), plenty of tough talk, and plenty of dead ends. He finds his man (played by Luther Adler), and gets religion too, religion that these guys, these Nazi guys and their dreams didn't stop in Europe in 1945. He signs up for the big tour, the big fight on a different front all over again. Welcome aboard, brother. Oh yah, beware, be very beware of guys out to avenge the death of dames with crooked teeth and who are too skinny but willing to fight the monsters of the planet such men, such average men are dangerous .",1352419200,,2905,4.52952380952381
7810903,4,6301327683,"""Cornered"" is an unusual film noir made by RKO in that it doesn't take place in the United States and involves no American characters. It takes place in France and in Argentina in 1945, after the Allied victory in Europe. Edward Dmytryk directs this quest for revenge by a distraught Canadian Air Force veteran. Lt. Laurence Gerard (Dick Powell) returns to France to learn how his bride Celeste died there. She was shot with a group of people from her village. Gerard's grieving father-in-law reluctantly tells him that a Vichy official named Marcel Jarnac (Luther Adler) ordered the execution. Officially, Jarnac is now dead himself, but Gerard doesn't believe it. He traces Jarnac's wife Madeleine (Micheline Cheirel) to Buenos Aires, hoping to get a lead.

A fast-talking ""professional guide"" named Melchior Incza (Walter Slezak) meets Gerard at the airport and imposes himself. He takes Gerard to a party where finds Mme. Jarnac, among other inscrutable figures of Buenos Aires society. A group of them is also looking for Jarnac with the intention of prosecuting him for war crimes, unbeknownst to Gerard. But Gerard is a man obsessed with finding the person responsible for his wife's death. He is confused by all the people he meets in Buenos Aires and suspicious of their motives. He despises them all. Who is Incza working for, and why did he meet Gerard at the airport? What does Madeleine Jarnac know? In his rage, Gerard bounces around between a cast of mysterious and glamorous characters looking for a clue.

""Cornered"" excels at conveying Gerard's helplessness, rage and disorientation. He doesn't even know if Jarnac is alive or, if he is, whom he might be. Neither does anyone else. He is frustrated and can't comprehend this cast of odd characters in Buenos Aires. Some say they want to help him. Some want to set him up. Others want to steal from him. Gerard doesn't know whom to trust. There is a surprising conversation between Gerard and Madeleine that we can barely hear for the noise of the subway. It's as if the city's very infrastructure is working against Gerard's ability to understand and communicate. It is Gerard's predicament that is interesting here, not the story. He has won the war, but the world is still as incomprehensible and hostile as a battlefield.",1346544000,,2292,4.935233160621761

* Year - 1945
* Place - Buenos Aires
* Summary of Plot - A Canadian air pilot searches for the killer of his French wife in Buenos Aires, but nobody knows what the man looks like.

Cast

Dick Powell (1904-63) plays the pilot. He was best known as a comedian and a crooner (""42nd Street"", ""Footlight Parade"", ""Gold Diggers of 1933"") so his appearance as Raymond Chandler's detective Philip Marlowe in ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944) was a big change of pace (one that he insisted on). Apparently it was a successful move because Powell followed this film with ""Cornered"" (1945), ""Johnny O'Clock"" (1947), and ""Cry Danger"" (1951). In the 50s he transitioned to TV as an extremely successful actor, director, and producer.

Walter Slezak (1902-83) plays an ambiguous character. Slezak was a great character actor who appeared in more than 50 films, often as a villain (e.g., ""Lifeboat"", ""Born to Kill"") but he did well in comedies (e.g., ""The Pirate"", ""The Inspector General"") and musicals  and won a Tony for ""Fanny"". This was his first American film and he does a good job.

Jack La Rue (1902-84) plays a co-conspirator. He was a heavyweight B class villain, filling in when Bogart and Raft were too big. He made over 100 films between 1925 and 1977.

Luther Adler (1903-84) was a multi-talented actor that moved gracefully between stage, TV and film. He was the brother of Stella Adler and worked with Lee Strasberg in the Group Theatre. He appeared in the remake of ""M"" (1951), played Hitler in ""The Desert Fox"" (1951), and played Paul Muni's colleague in ""The Last Angry Man"" (1959).

Morris Carnovsky (1897-1992) plays a lawyer. He was a member of Actors Studio with Luther Adler and was blacklisted in the 50s because he was a Communist.

Steven Geray (1904-73) made nearly 200 films and TV shows between 1929 and 1966. He often played a European in films like ""The 7th Cross"" (1944) and ""Hotel Berlin"" (1945).

Production

Director -  Edward Dmytryk (1908-1999) was part of the Hollywood 10, a group of blacklisted film makers imprisoned during the McCarthy era. Dmytryk was nominated for an Oscar for ""Crossfire"" (1947) and won at Cannes. He was twice nominated for a DGA award - ""the Young Lions"" (1958) and ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954). Dymtryk and Powell made ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944).

Cinematographer - Harry Wild (1901-61) made 91 films. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Army Girl"" 1938, but is best known for shooting 13 film noir including ""Murder my Sweet"" and he shot 7 Jane Russel films

Music - The musical score from Roy Webb (1888-1982) is excellent, a great example of how music can supplement the story without imposing. Webb is best known from his work with Val Lewton, though he worked on more than 200 films and was nominated for an Oscar 6 times between 1938 and 1946.

Evaluation

The film was a big success, earning more than ""Murder my Sweet"" But Dmytryk was upbraided by his communist party members for changing the script and making it anti fascist rather than pro communist. Dymtyk quit the party as a result, but that didn't prevent him from being investigated by HUAC.

The NY Times called it a ""drama of smoldering vengeance and political scheming which builds purposefully and with graduating tension.""

Strengths

* Suspenseful
* Interesting set of characters
* First of many films to deal with ex -Nazis

Weaknesses

* Powell is too one-dimensional
* Once you get to Buenos Aires the plot can be a little hard to follow

Bottom Line - An OK drama",1339718400,,3489,4.760797342192691
7810905,4,6301327683,this is a good Powell action film. It was originally made in black and white and I was sorry to see this version was colorized. In my opinon the color degraded the film.,1299542400,,169,4.151515151515151
7810906,4,6301327683,"CORNERED(1945)---(directed by Edward Dmytryk)---Dick Powell, Walter Slezak, Micheline Cheirel, Nina Vale, Morris Carnovsky, Luther Adler.
I was not aware of this film noir until I ran across a description of it on the Free Movies On DVD site. It proved to be an enjoyable surprise. It was made a year after Powell's image-changing role as hard-boiled private eye Philip Marlowe in, MURDER, MY SWEET(also directed by Dmytryk). Powell plays a very ""Marlowe-like"" individual in this movie---indeed, his character is even more ""hard-boiled"" in this film---and it is full of the crackling dialogue that is one of the hallmarks of noir. The film opens with Powell's character being de-mobilized from the RCAF at the end of WWII. We soon learn that his French wife was among a group of Resistance fighters who were shot by the Germans. Powell is obsessed with finding, and killing, the man responsible for ordering the shootings. His search takes him from Paris to Marseilles to Buenos Aires. Upon arriving in Argentina, Powell is approached by one Melchior Incza(Slezak), a decidedly shady-looking character who seems to know a great deal about Powell and his mission. He offers to help Powell accomplish his objective and the film takes off from there. The plot becomes intricate, as befits a noir, and is full of ""twists and turns""---no one, it seems, is to be trusted. The climax of the film is quintessentially ""noirish"" and quite effective. Although the plot is complicated, one never has a sense of being as ""hopelessly lost"" as is the case with some other, more well-known noirs, e.g., MURDER, MY SWEET; THE BIG SLEEP; etc. The cast is uniformly good in their various roles, with Powell and Slezak turning in two of the best performances of their respective careers---IMO. Luther Adler does more with his brief, but crucial, appearance than many actors do with a whole film. And, while the two female leads are ""unknowns""(at least to me), they are also very good. In sum, this is an engrossing film and I greatly enjoyed it---it was a treat to discover it. I would readily recommend it to any fan of film noir",1257638400,,2110,4.929775280898877
7810907,4,6301327683,"Hot on the heels of his success in Murder, My Sweet comes Dick Powell in Cornered. Again a tough guy, Laurence Gerard (Powell) is in search of his wife's killer, a man named Marcel Jarnac. The problem is, Jarnac is dead, or so everyone says. Gerard knows better, and his thirst for revenge is so great, he is willing to put himself into the path of danger to achieve it. He persues Jarnac's wife (Micheline Cheirel) and with the help of a shady tour guide (Walter Slezak) does his best to kill Jarnac before Jarnac kills him.

Thankfully, the actor playing Jarnac is not credited until the end of the film. This way the viewer does not guess and is kept in suspense. Cornered is rather suspenseful in some places, especially in those that most resemble typical film noir. The scene in the subway between Mrs. Jarnac and Gerald is brilliantly paced with the passing of trains; each pause in conversation makes one more anxious to hear what is to be said. The final scene in the dark hideout is intense as one might expect it to be, but the use of lighting (or lack thereof) is used to full effect.

Cornered is also notable for the casting of Powell. Although he had success once before in a noir drama, this type of role was still pretty foreign to him, but he handles it expertly. He looks completely different than he did in his crooning days complete with buzzcut, deep wrinkles, and a concerned expression. This film also shows a side of Powell that one might not expect; he has a crying scene. It is brief, but heartfelt and adds another level to his performance.",1213920000,3,1568,4.4982456140350875
