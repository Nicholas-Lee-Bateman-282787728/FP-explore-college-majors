2655186,3,B000ICM5KS,Good product - the beanie Garfield is very cute. DVD is very funny but that's just Garfield for you!,1196294400,,100,4.315789473684211
2655187,3,B000ICM5KS,"I love Garfield. I have bought all the Garfield DVD releases to date. Even though this DVD has repeated material from the Garfield & Friends DVD series, I wanted to get it for the theme of the disc as it picks out certain segments to intrigue the audience more.

However, I could not be more dissapointed with the picture. For anyone wanting to buy this, know that the picture is not digitally transferred. What this means is it will look far more distorted on a digital tv or HDTV. Old style analog tv's will look clear, but more up-to-date tv's will not. As someone who's gone HD, this makes the experience of owning this themed DVD a bit dissapointing.",1176508800,2,655,4.504201680672269

How to be Funny

I only bought the DVD because I am a fan of the series.",1346716800,2,593,4.737864077669903
8145014,5,B000ICM5KS,We love Garfield in this house.  I used to watch Garfield every saturday morning when I was a kid and now my kids love Garfield as much as I do.,1316736000,,144,3.8
8145015,4,B000ICM5KS,"I love this show; I used to watch it all the time as a kid. I still think Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield was by far the best. This is a summary of shows from the series Garfield and Friends.

Beware if you already own the tv series on dvd, however. These are taken directly from the series, so you are basically just having the convenience of skipping directly to the garfield cartoon from the US Acres cartoons and the shorts.

I'm a fan and the price was still nice for me to own this summary dvd and the tiny beanie baby garfield, but stay away otherwise.",1262390400,4,560,4.175925925925926
8145016,5,B000ICM5KS,"My son is a big fan and this movie/plush combo is the greatest!  The plush is small, just right for little hands.  In  fact, it is about the size of my hand.  It is not furry, but the material is soft, so I think it could be wiped off if need be.  He loves it and it's a great size to take along.",1231632000,,296,3.634920634920635
