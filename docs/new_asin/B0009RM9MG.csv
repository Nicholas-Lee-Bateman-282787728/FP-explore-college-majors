8065660,5,B0009RM9MG,"It is a little pricey for a 1-hour instructional video (especially when the intro, the ""bending"" section, and the outro all eat up some of that time.)  But when you can't find instruction like this elsewhere, I suppose it's worth it.

The video starts out simple, but about 8 minutes in or so it starts to get complicated.  When I first got this, I thought no way can I ever accomplish what this guy does.  But a month later my chugging has improved ten-fold, I've learned some new percussive techniques, and I've got a lot more to practice!

One criticism: I would have enjoyed tips from Madcat on how to improve speed (besides just practicing), and tips on breathing.  He shows you how to play it slow, and then demonstrates it fast, but doesn't really give advice on how to actually play that fast. I'm figuring it out slowly but surely.",1402012800,3,840,4.529801324503311
8065661,5,B0009RM9MG,"Peter Madcat Ruth is not only a nice guy but a great player.  This video is well done and easy to follow though it is a lot of work.  I will never have the speed that he has but i enjoy learning it.  Recently met him and he is as funny, nice, and humble as he is good on the harmonica.  His qualities are amplified in his teaching style.  You will enjoy this.",1381795200,6,359,3.863013698630137
8065662,4,B0009RM9MG,"I'm enjoying this instructional blues harp video, taught by Madcat Ruth, for it gives me an idea of what it must've been like in Woodstock, NY, during the days of heavily laden air...

Kidding aside, with a bunch of dedicated practice I can be a better harpist having had the experience of learning from this DVD.

Perhaps a bit too expensive, but ""what the hey"".

8065663,5,B0009RM9MG,"I've seen Madcat play on numerous occasions and have often wondered how he does some of the incredible things he does.  On this video, he really shows you all the tricks.  Its fun to watch and fun to try!  I would highly recommend this DVD.",1241049600,14,240,4.288888888888889
8065664,4,B0009RM9MG,I'm a self-taught harmonica player.  I was looking for instruction material to expand my rhythm playing.  This Madcat Ruth DVD is just what I was looking for.,1142208000,21,158,4.814814814814815
