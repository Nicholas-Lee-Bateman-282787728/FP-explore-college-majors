7975001,5,B00007CVSB,"Anyway one looks at this totally awesome set,this is a must have for every serious student of the cinema;amateur or pro.
The Birth of a Nation(released(Feb/15)starring,among others,Lillian Gish,Mae Marsh and Henry B. Walthall,is an historical look at the hardening of the U.S.into one country and the reasons thereof,before,during and after the Civil War. There is a love story of course,a look at two families connected from the North and South,the founding of the KKK who Griffith elevates in status from just racist bigots to that of sworn protectors of everything good and decent. Despite its extremely controversial theme,this film is a must see. You may not agree with Griffith's take,but one cannot deny the power of the message he conveys. Extras include a featurette on its making,a filmed 1930 prologue,seven Griffith directed Civil War themed shorts from 1910 and 1911excerpts from the original souvenir program and detailed info on the controversial 1922 re-release and the NAACP's involvement and protests. There are two discs here.
Orphans of the Storm(released Sept/21)star,among others,Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish. This wonderful film stars the Gish sisters in a story set before and during the French Revolution. Lillian is the adopted one,found as an infant on the steps of a Church,where the father of another child, who was also going to leave his baby there,decides to bring both home. The plague,some years later, kills both parents and leaves Dorthy blind. The sisters enter into a pact to always look after one another. The head off to Paris through circumstances not of their choosing,get separated. Lillian never stops trying to find her sister who has been kidnapped by street folks who force her to do her bidding. The Revolution comes and the""storm""gets worse. When the two finally find each other Lillian and her boyfriend are headed for the Guillotine. In the end the two are happily re-united. This is a riveting story with almost as many characters as a Tolstoy novel,but more easily digested. As always Griffith strives for historically accurate touches which adds to the ominous atmosphere of the sisters surroundings in Paris. Extras include an intro by Orson Welles,footage of Griffith's funeral,a radio eulogy by Erich Von Stroheim,a bio of Griffith from Photoplay  and a 1908 short ""Rescued from the Eagles Nest""starring Griffith himself. One disc. 5 stars.
Broken Blossoms(released May/19)stars,among others,  Lillian Gish,Richard Barthelmess and Donald Crisp. The story here finds Gish as the object of affection from Barthelmess,a Chinese man who came to London. Crisp is Gish's despicable father who beats her regularly. When Crisp finds out about the Chinaman's affection he kills Gish. Barthelmess retaliates and kills Crisp,then himself. This is yet another powerful Griffith film which portrays Crisp's brutality to the nth degree, leaving us wanting to wrap our arms around a set upon Gish. Extras include a filmed intro by Gish,excerpts from Gish's /25 Romola,the complete text of the original story,a recording of the 1919 title song,Griffith on leading ladies and info on the score. One disc. 5 stars.
A two disc set of 23 Biograph films from 1908 -1913. These include shorts starring some of the greatest names from Griffiths stable of actors including Blanche Sweet,Mary Pickford,the Gish sisters,Lionel Barrymore,Henry B.Walthall and so many more. This is a total treasure trove of historical treasures. 5 stars.
Finally there is the classic Intolerance(released Sept/16)stars,among others,Mae Marsh,Robert Harron,Constance Talmadge and Lillian Gish. This is the story of love and intolerance of society  through the ages from Babylon,to the time and circumstances leading to Jesus' death,to the period of the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre to finally modern day. Griffith pulls out all the stops for this one and must have used every actor he had on the lot in some capacity or other,plus hundreds of extras. Those classic Babylonian scenes never fail to impress even today. I was expecting a staid and confusing film but Griffith weaves his tale beautifully and manages to keep ones attention throughout. Extras include an intro by Orson Welles,excerpts from the films Cabiria and the Last Days of Pompeii(1914)which inspired him to make this film,an excerpt from the film The Fall of Babylon and excerpts from pamphlets made by Griffith upon the films release. One disc. 5 stars.
All in all a MUST HAVE set. There are no proper adjectives to describe this set's historical importance to film buffs. It is also a great teaching tool for students and novice movie goers. Kino-Lorber are to be congratulated on releasing such am outstanding collection.",1484784000,,4713,5.306559571619813

7975004,5,B00007CVSB,"This is a near perfect collection of great films.  What film buff could ask for anymore?  Except for Collection II!  I can't emphasize how enjoyable this collection is.  The films, most of them I have seem before, have never been in a better condition or form.  The extras are well worth a look and something to savor.  The DVDs include a Biograph shorts collection, A Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, Broken Blossoms and Orphans of the Storm.  A five part article from Photoplay from 1915 revealed to me new understandings and revelations.  Griffith, from most viewers perceptions has a flaw in his films, his use of 19th century acting techniques.  The article and interview with Griffith reveals that Griffith was seen as bringing a more naturalistic form of acting to the screen.  Most probably stage acting was even more pronounced and Griffith actually lightened it.  What probably happened was that the naturalistic acting style he started sped up and surpassed his ability to change.  The author of the articles mentions that Griffith took a laughed at and ridiculed medium (cinema) and made it more than an novelty item.  He introduced feeling and a solid story to the American film industry.  Erich Von Stronheim in his eulogy states that Griffith realized the necessity of using music that fit with the movies and creating costumes that fit the actor and the part.  This is just a wonderful collection and I'm very enthusiastic about it.",1230422400,3,1447,4.921487603305785
7975005,3,B00007CVSB,"""His Trust"" was the fourth of Griffith's first seven Civil War Shorts. Actually there were only six, ""His Trust"" was the only two-reeler and against Griffith's wishes Biograph released it serially, calling the second reel ""His Trust Fulfilled"". It lacks the charm of the remaining five shorts and is painfully cornball in comparison to most of Griffith's Biograph work.

Wilfred Lucus (in blackface) plays George, a faithful Negro servant entrusted by his owner with the welfare of his wife and young daughter when he goes off to fight for the South. Predictibly the owner dies in a nicely staged battle sequence, union soldiers burn the mansion in a poorly staged arson sequence, and George rescues the daughter and his master's sword. The daughter grows up in George's cabin. In the second reel George pays for her education at a seminary, and resists the temptation to steal when his money runs out. She eventually marries her ""cousin"" (seriously) and George gets to keep the sword.

Although a rather weak story, ""His Trust"" is significant for several reasons. It's subject, a southern family reduced to poverty by the war mirrors Griffith's own situation. Griffith's father served in Kentucky's ""Orphan Brigade"" during the Civil War and the family never really recovered from the financial setbacks that resulted.

It's hero, a ""good Negro"", is portrayed affectionately-if somewhat patronizingly; a precursor of what was to come in ""Birth of a Nation"".

Finally, ""His Trust"" was Griffith's first foray outside the world of single reel shorts. Griffith was pressing Biograph for funding to do longer films. Other studios had already released the five reel ""Life of Moses"", a four reel ""Les Miserables"", and a three reel version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"". Biograph's resistance to the concept of longer films would eventually be a factor in Griffith's split with his original studio, a production house that owed its #1 reputation to Griffith's vision and innovation.

Even in 1910 Griffith seemingly had grasped the change that was taking place as feature length films would not be released serially but would play as extended showings in legitimate theaters.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1144540800,5,2208,5.133704735376044
7975006,5,B00007CVSB,"Mack Sennett, Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, Erich von Stroheim, Tod Browning, John Ford, Allan Dwan, Wallace Reid, and Lionel Barrymore were just a handful of the talents employed by D. W. Griffith before their future successes in the motion picture industry. D.W. Griffith filmed ""Birth of a Nation""(without a screenplay) in 1915, a few miles north of Hollywood in the Chatsworth hills of San Fernando Valley. For 25 years, it's $50 million box office record was unmatched. Future movie mogul Louis B. Mayer secured the East Coast rights to ""Birth"" and walked away with $500,000 in profits. Fragile close-ups, deft cross-cutting, and the ultimate chase scene: ""Birth of a Nation"" became the genesis of modern film. But as Griffith himself said, he didn't direct movies, he promoted an ""art form"". He was right. In 2002, Kino Films released the 7-disc DVD ""Griffith Masterworks"". Thia digital transfer gives you more than 30 complete films, newsreels, documentaries, photos, commentaries by Orson Welles, and much more. You also get a 6-minute filmed interview with actor Walter Huston and D. W. Griffith himself. They smoke cigarettes and chew the scenery(very interesting). This DVD set has over 10 hours of material(much of it rare, uncensored, and never available before). In 1949, D. W. Griffith lived alone in the Knickerbocker Hotel, spending nights wandering local Los Angeles bars. It is said that he often gazed out his hotel window down onto the corner across the street; the intersection of Hollywood and Sunset boulevard. This corner was once the site of the Babylonian set used in his ""Intolerance"". A few months later he died. Today in Hollywood, there is no major plaque, no monument, no testimonial commemorating the man who transformed a sleepy, dusty L.A. suburb into today's trillion dollar capital of the motion picture industry. D. W. Griffith will never be forgotten. I only hope that he will be remembered.",1097107200,37,1929,5.146496815286624
7975007,5,B00007CVSB,"This DVD set is very impressive. Not only does it offer the masterpieces of D.W. Griffith's career (including, of course, Birth of a Nation) but it also has all the shorts from the two videos ""Selected Biograph Shorts,"" additional shorts, a biography and news items, and memorabilia. I am very happy to finally be able to see ""In the Border States"" and ""The House with Closed Shutters."" They both star my favorite actor, Henry B. Walthall, and I was searching for these shorts for awhile. I believe this set represents the first time these shorts have been made widely available. Considering their age, they look great on this set. In addition, this collection offers a 6 minute discussion of Birth of a Nation between the director himself and Walter Huston (who played Lincoln in Griffith's 1930 talkie Abraham Lincoln), clips of Griffith's funeral, radio eulogy by Erich von Stroheim, and many other ""special features."" The memorabilia includes lobby cards and programs for Birth of a Nation, articles from Photoplay magazine which are copied well and easy to read, and photos, postcards and magazine covers of Griffith's leading ladies. I only wish the leading men received the same treatment, but one can't have everything. A silly short starring Griffith (""Rescued From the Eagle's Nest"" from 1908) and a very fake looking bird is included. The presentation is very well-done with video clips and period music on the menu pages. The packaging is also handsome and displayable. I was hoping little booklets would be included with each disc, however, there are only slips of paper with the film listings and pictures. Still, the bonus shorts and tons of extras make this a must for any Griffith or silent film collection.",1061942400,36,1724,4.989583333333333
