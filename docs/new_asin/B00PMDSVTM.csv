6818188,5,B00PMDSVTM,"I haven't seen Ink, so I really didn't know what to expect with this movie. Wow, what a truly mind bending film. I loved how the movie challenged me to broaden my experience and really pay attention. The acting was uniformly excellent, (mostly unknowns) especially the male lead. I really cared about what was happening to him. I also loved how non formulaic the film was. There was some violence and car chases, but that did not at all dominate the action of the movie. I loved it! The music was great. It felt like I was being carried along on waves from scene to scene. Now I'll have to see Ink. Can't wait for more from this director.",1418083200,13,638,4.369747899159663
6818189,4,B00PMDSVTM,"Fans of Science Fiction should like this movie. It's heavy on the fiction but, original storyline. For a minute or two I thought I was going crazy. It leaves a lot of explaining to one's own imagination and that always makes for a good product.",1417824000,4,244,4.444444444444445
6818190,3,B00PMDSVTM,"First off, see ""Ink"" which is also by the Winans and Double edge films. What does that have to do with this movie? Well not much, but it did influence how I felt about this movie. Ink is one of my favorites and I've watched it many times. In comparison though... The Frame is slower. You are introduced to a couple people and an interesting idea but there are many scenes of the two people thinking deeply (not that every movie needs a group of characters, some comic relief, a few fight scenes and then an explosion but just be prepared...). The last third of the movie changes in many ways but isn't necessarily explained. I like stories with multiple interpretations that make you think but a few hints might help (I can't say much without spoilers but while some things are hinted at, others really aren't explained at all (I look forward to the commentary). It might sound like I didn't like the movie and to be honest I originally thought of a 3 star review (maybe a 2 star review of the trailer since afterward all I knew about the movie is that there was a masked man and a guy in a top hat) but I did like it enough to watch late into the night even though I had to be up early the next day. I also thought about different meanings the next day (I like deep movies) and considered watching again the next night. maybe I'm unfairly comparing it to Ink with the themes of good and evil, regret and responsibility, funny parts and sad. By taking things down a peg, some would say that they made a more realistic movie (in a sense) with less gimmicks. After I watch it again, I may have to revise this review...",1417651200,5,1616,4.301639344262295
6818191,3,B00PMDSVTM,"First off, a spoiler-free synopsis and mini review.
The Frame is about Samantha, a paramedic, and Alex, a criminal, who exist in each others TVs.  When Samantha goes home at the end of the day, she watches a hard edged crime show called Thieves and Saints.  When Alex goes home at the end of the day, he watches a medical drama called Urban Hope.  Samantha is the star of Urban Hope, and Alex is the star of Thieves and Liars.
One day, after the final credits roll and the characters have fallen asleep in front of their TVs, they wake up to discover that the shows have not gone off the air, the ""camera"" has stayed on the two, and continued to broadcast, allowing them to converse in real time through the TV.  They must come to grips with this impossibility and deal with sinister forces, reruns, and cancellation.
The film is at times brilliant, innovative, and beautiful, but it makes mistakes early and often.

* * * Here there be spoilers. * * *

First, the good.  The Frame is enjoyable to watch, and is very thought provoking about free will, reality, and what syndication means to real people who exist in TV shows.  The titular frame is one of the most creative and effective filmic devices I have seen in recent years, and has as much wow factor as the furniture that reassembles itself in Winans previous film, Ink.  Indeed, the movie itself is a character in The Frame.  It is two parts The Truman Show, one part Delirious, and season with David Lynch to taste.
The cast is brilliant, and the actors exude emotions that ring as true even as they are confronted by the impossible.
The notion of TV as a liminal zone is not new, but having two TVs acting as each others faerie ring brings an Escher-like quality that breathes freshness into this concept.

Unfortunately, there is a great deal of time spent waiting for the characters to catch up to the audience.  That, combined with some questionable pacing choices means that the film drags occasionally.  We don't really need to see how real characters would react each and every step of the way to their realization; a simple montage would suffice.
Speaking of montages, Winans attempts to use auditory montages, which feature dialog that is out of synch with the action on the screen. In more competent hands, this can be an effective method of conveying time. In The Frame, it simply looks like a technical glitch, and disorients the viewer.
Music features quite prominently in the film, and plays a key part of the climax.  Despite this, Winans intentionally chose to not have violin music playing when Alex plays it.  We have to assume he is playing the same song that Samantha has been humming, which requires the audience to fill in the needless blank spot.
Much is left for the audience to interpret, and while this can be intriguing, in The Frame it feels like lazy storytelling.  While Ink was full of mystery and imagery, it felt like a cohesive narrative with a definite structure and conclusion.  If anything, The Frame has no frame because too much is left to the audience to decipher in retrospect.  One obvious and glaring example of this is The Mechanic, who seems to exist in three realities simultaneously.  There is nothing other than a single line to explain who he is and what his motivations are.  I believe he is the anti-typewriter, the opposing force to that which creates.
Finally, the film suffers from poor sound design.  Too many times we strain to determine what the characters are saying, and when some of the characters have accents, we are totally lost.  Then there are the aforementioned times when we don't even have lips moving to provide a visual cue, and the audience is left feeling adrift.  Fortunately, none of the dialog is actually important to the story.  I think the film could play as silent, and it would work just as well as with sound.

The Frame is a good film, but not a great one.  Fans of Ink or Guillermo del Toro will enjoy the look of the film, as long as they can get past the myriad technical problems surrounding the film, much like awellframe.",1417392000,112,4069,4.6011080332409975
6818192,4,B00PMDSVTM,A very unusual story. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill scifi thriller. It seems to get a bit disjointed toward the end but it keeps your attention. The Frame is a must see for those who want something original and totally off-the-wall!,1417305600,,238,4.975

6818194,3,B00PMDSVTM,Surprisingly the acting wasn't bad. Old story uniquely presented but the direction was poor. And the scene at the end with him could have been more realistic if he actually moved his fingers (cant say more without spoiling and I detest spoilers) Not worth renting but for free its great if you are in a pinch for a movie and have some time to kill.,1529193600,,348,4.369230769230769
6818195,3,B00PMDSVTM,"It is thought-provoking, all right. A thought like ""Should I continue watching?"" And at the end  ""Did I miss something?""

6818208,5,B00PMDSVTM,"Thought provoking and challenging.  There are many reviews here that reflect my assessment of this movie so I won't repeat them.  I will observe that a lot of what is labeled as science fiction these days is nothing more than an action film set in outer space.  They are less about provoking thought and more about classic violent plot lines interpreted in a different setting  -  Outer space instead of an urban setting.  So if you're looking for something that is Mind candy easy to consume - that does not make you question - that does not allow you to make your own conclusions, then you should not watch this movie  All the reviews that say it is too slow are because they do not want to think about the context for the movie.  It does not have a simple linear progression.  It is marvelously complex and contradictory.  I like that!  If you do also, you will love this movie.  I have never seen the movie INK but now will have to check that out to see if it is as much of a gem as this one is.",1526860800,,999,4.227513227513228
6818209,5,B00PMDSVTM,"I really really liked this movie. kept me on the edge of my seat till the end which was the perfect ending in my opinion. Loved it! I connected personally to the film. It being filmed in my city Denver, Colorado. That made the movie that much more trippy.",1526256000,,255,4.224489795918367
6818210,5,B00PMDSVTM,"I enjoyed Ink but that was only after I first tried and made around 15 minutes. Then several months later I was looking at the suggestions and looked and saw that I had tried once before but saw the reviews and decided to try 20 minutes. I'm glad I did because I was hooked. I did exactly the same with this movie because I liked Ink so much. Maybe 30 minutes and went ""Oh, sh%%, can't do it"" Tonight I guess I was in the mood to get my mind bent. It's not for everyone unless they can go with what I like to call a flow of consciousness or maybe suspension of disbelief. It's a hell of a movie for those who want something out of the ordinary. And for those I highly recommend that if at first you don't succeed give a rest and then try again.
Oh and the negative reviewers are right. It's flawed. It's hard to follow. It's way too long. It's boring. Hey, but so what aren't we all? Enjoy.",1525910400,,890,4.0625
6818211,2,B00PMDSVTM,"The actors were very good. I would like to see them on film again.

The film was not what I expected to see. It isn't science fiction. The concept was intriguing but once the religious stuff started I felt like I had been suckered and I was over it.  Im not interested in movies with religious themes. Amazon should create that as a genre category and move these God movies there.

It gets two stars because the actors were the best thing about this film.",1525910400,,455,4.329411764705882

6818213,4,B00PMDSVTM,"Low buck$ production was only reason for 4 stars not 5. I loved it. Really. If you thought it was slow, well, yes, it was. Purposefully! :D This is one of those sci fi flics that novices and those with no imaginations can't watch easily. You're not meant to easily watch it. Some times you have to work to enjoy a film as good as this one. All you 1-star nay-sayers, go to bed, get a good night's sleep, drink some coffee, go to work, and then stay up late Friday night/Saturday morning ane watch it again.

6818215,1,B00PMDSVTM,"Impossibly slow ""parallel reality"" tale that devolves into...I don't know what.  You can follow the story easily enough; but the film is SLOW and keeps piling on ""clever"" twists until you forget (or never even knew) its original objective.

Lead actors David CarranzaandTiffany Mualem play dual roles, as themselves (as actors) in two different dramatic TV series AND as two television viewers (Alex and Samantha) who are watching the two TV series.  That's the premise...Lost yet?

Unexpectedly, Alex and Samantha see each other directly through the TV screen, like unintended Skype.  That is to say, Alex sees Samantha at home watching the TV, and Samantha sees Alex at home watching TV.  They mistake each other for the actors, David CarranzaandTiffany Mualem.  Lost yet?

It gradually dawns on the two viewers that the TV series they are watching are actually real, that they're watching each other's lives unfold.

It gets worse.  Samantha dies in real life and Alex plays reruns of her TV series in a continuous loop on his TV to keep her alive.  As it turns out, some sort of evil psychotherapist/drug-cartel/screenwriter DEMON is engineering the whole thing.

Now I KNOW you're lost.

You CAN follow this, but the story is inundated with ""WTF is going on?"" moments, even AFTER you understand what's going on.  It drags on forever, the story adding new twists and more twists and no resolution in sight, and it's not helpful that David CarranzaandTiffany Mualem don't have any acting range...Mualem has a wide-eyed, blank expression while Carranza has a painfully-constipated expression throughout the entire movie.  That's their range.

I don't blame the actors, because the acting is actually pretty good, all things considered.  But I blame the director for becoming enchanted with a story that's not all that imaginative and for dragging it out to a lame conclusion.",1525651200,,1877,5.121710526315789
6818216,5,B00PMDSVTM,"Fantastic!! Of course I liked Ink so knew what to kind of storytelling to expect. This one is very well done, loved it!",1525564800,,119,4.217391304347826

6818218,4,B00PMDSVTM,"I agree with other reviewers: it's trippy, David Lynch-y and about 1/2 hour too long.  But it's also original and interesting, and the two leads are AMAZING.  Definitely worth a watch...or two.",1524960000,,193,5.0

6818221,3,B00PMDSVTM,"Very clever and interesting take on an old idea. Good acting.

The script is so-so, I didn't feel that either main character was very realistic.

Asked about herself, Sam tells Alex about HIMSELF.

They flounder in their attempts to discover what is happening to them in ways that are illogical beyond the effects of weird things happening.

A wrong telephone number conversation would have been the place for the scriptwriter to start--the situation is not so weird as the characters seem determined to think...at least not at first.",1521244800,,534,5.034090909090909

Excellent performances by the actors & the director really timed each 'frame' significantly. Suggest you watch it more than once & you'll notice other subtleties in the movie.

There are a lot of great twists and ideas in The Frame, however, the story line needed some fine-tuning before going into production - in particular at the end, where it's too repetitive and does not complete the stories of both characters equally - in particular with Sam (Tiffany Mualem).

6818235,3,B00PMDSVTM,"... the best part of the film.  These actors are good.  Especially when what they were given to work with insofar as dialogue and script.  I don't know these 2 primaries, but they need to be given better work; we'd soon see their names in lights.  The script and storyline isn't much.  Dismembered, difficult to follow from scene to scene regarding continuity and transition and the entire film is not much more than a meander from unrelated scene to confusing circumstance.  If this film were rendered as art, I would be reminded of Swarez' Lost for Words, or anything by Javier Gil.  As noted in other reviews, the film almost made a kind of basket case sense until the last half hour, when too much symbolism was brought into play and it just got a little ridiculous  with the framing.  I kept waiting for some cohesive event to bring the whole of it together and none came. The ending was a combination of unnecessary explanation and far too late realism with no apparent point.  Everything had been made pointless by then.
I think this was a mediocre plot turned into a mediocre story adapted to a weak screenplay and edited into a patchwork of unrelated scenarios.. with outstanding acting by the leads.
I at first thought it may be a fleshing out of Shakespeare's As You Like It, Act II, Scene VII, and that flavor was apparent until the last 30 minutes.  Then it began to more resemble The Truman Show, and as the film got to midpoint it became a sort of hybrid of the two.  There just isn't anything for it to work with when the whole thing is built on a story line pulled out of the sky.",1506729600,2,1597,4.450171821305842

On the positive side, the acting performances in this movie are good. I especially enjoyed Tiffany Mualem, an actress I had never before seen or heard of. She's hot!!!

On the negative side, the movie was pretentious in its use of ""Meaningful Symbolism"" and ""Disturbing Images."" (What was with all that gooey crude oil oozing out of buildings, etc.?) And I felt the movie dragged on too long.

Our life is both a maturation and a  test. It is not a test if there are no wrong answers to choose from. The ultimate strength of materials and character cannot be known until they are stressed to the breaking point. Those who blame and curse God because life isn't a bowl of cherries don't understand that in order to deliver joy, you must deliver misery to contrast it with, In order for there to be good, there has to be evil. The universe exists because of opposition in all things physical and nonphysical exerting their opposite influences against each other. Like in the creation story, right there for everyone to read in plain sight ... Eve partook of the fruit and now man can become as gods, knowing good and evil. There is sorrow in conception and by the sweat of our brows, we eat our bread  ... all for our benefit. She made the right choice, not as most religions teach. I love the line ...  paraphrased : God tests us so that we can see ourselves as he sees us. We are his children, and as such, can grow up to be like him. We are created in his image.

The characters were poorly developed and their responses to the situation weren't believable. I absolutely felt that i was watching some mediocre movie the entire time. If you're going to make a play for theoretical physics, you'd better have the depth, breadth and creativity to back it up. It just didn't capture me on a human OR philosophical level. That being said, the ending was really fun and visually beautiful and Alex's backstory was heartwrenching to an extent that it was worth plodding through the film just to see how he made out, because you kind of root for him. And the movie wasn't boring, really. If i were 12, I might have really, really enjoyed it. And in addition, the photography was excellent and backed up by a haunting soundtrack.

6818368,4,B00PMDSVTM,"Original story replete with twists and turns; just when you think it's over, the ride continues! Low budget it may be, but the director made the most of what he had. And the acting was definitely not ""low-budget""--both leads delivered poignant performances, especially the male lead (why isn't he in more films? His IMDB page is pretty thin...). Cinematography had a big role in setting the tone, which was dark, moody, and emotionally charged.

Really liked this movie and recommend it for its clever storyline and ability to build an emotional connection to these characters (in lesser hands, the film could have fallen flat). Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 primarily because the film needed some editing--of length and ideas. The last 30 minutes, while mind-bending, came a bit too far out of left field w/o sufficient conceptual framework having been established earlier in the film (i.e., the ""evil"" character...how was that linked to the ""frame"" concept? The story would have worked fine--better, even--without it. And the childhood flashbacks would have been better used in character development vice as some sort of revelation near the end of the story, which felt a bit contrived.) In other words, by dragging it out and introducing so many plot twists late in the film, I was left with a sort of emotional fatigue.

THAT SAID, these flaws don't detract from the overall experience, and really, that's what it is: an experience. I would watch again and recommend it to my friends.",1472774400,,1487,4.967871485943775

It all felt so natural, like I was dropped into the middle of the story, but there were just enough information to clue me into what was going on without explaining it all outright. Not one moment did I even consider looking away because if I did, I would've missed something. It kept my mind engaged the entire time.

6818407,3,B00PMDSVTM,"So the movie is not a well-told story - which is supposed to be the point, right? The characters are difficult to connect with, and the audience is left trying to comprehend the barely existent connection between the two main characters while having minimal exposition into their story. The music that accompanies the majority of the movie is bland, failing to mark out the climax or anti-climax of the movie, let alone allow the audience to feel the conflicts more deeply. The premise does not make any sense and makes less as one gets deeper into the film.

In a different sense, one might see this film as a masterpiece. I certainly see this thought in the top reviews. There is one saving quality, excluding the quality filmwork, sound, and the way the characters interact: novelty. The characters characterize ones you might find on any popular TV show; if you watch one or both of these types of TV, you probably don't need much exposition - and if you can empathize with the type of character, you feel their conflicts well enough that to some viewers it might not matter that every version of logic I, at least, can imagine to explain things is completely turned on its head in the conclusion. So the movie is interesting enough to be called a novelty, and the story is unusual, but do not create the traditional sense of a story. It takes an unfocused mind to enjoy, and is created for someone who doesn't feel their life is a great accomplishment; in short, this movie is escapism at it's best - questions, seemingly deep questions that are never answered to one's satisfaction.",1468540800,,1588,4.671428571428572

To accomplish what he does on such small budgets is impressive, and I admire his penchant for solid acting and thoughtful pacing... But... PACING!  Good lord!  The pacing of THE FRAME was absolutely geologic, as in, what could have been earnestly expressed in moments - a beat - were instead drawn out through into what felt like eons!  With good acting and storytelling the audience doesn't need to be witness to every single moment the characters are experiencing.  The performer's wonderful performances are buried in self-indulgent editing and heavy-handed storytelling - a very creative story, to be sure, but one that is weighed down to the depths of boredom by either an untamed writer/director's narcism or his insecurity.  Such a shame, since INK was such a wonderful, emotion, original experience.  THE FRAME feels like REELS AND REELS AND REELS of unedited artistic indulgence.",1468281600,2,1034,5.113095238095238

6818415,5,B00PMDSVTM,"There's a lot to like and dislike about this movie, some people will love it (yours truly) and some people are going to hate it.  I'm not going to say much about the plot here because you really need to go into it spoiler free, plus describing the plot wouldn't actually do the movie any justice.  So instead, here's the Con's and Pro's for this movie...

Cons:
It's slow...  very slow.
It's low budget and in a few shots, it looks it too (one of the side effects with shooting in digital in darkened area's)
It's really two movies in one, and if the director/writer had stuck with one or the other, he probably wouldn't have such polarizing reviews on here (**SPOILER ALERT** for instance if he'd done this movie as a straight up crime thriller following one character, I think it would have been a lot more popular and one of the better indie crime thrillers around).

Pro's:
Ok, remember where I said it's a low budget movie and in a few shots it looks it?  Well except for those few shots, the movie looks amazing.  From the lighting, set design, camera angles....... it really does look fantastic.
The soundtrack is amazing (also composed by the director).
The performances are fantastic, not just from the leads, but even the supporting cast gives it their all (I really liked the few scenes where the director stops the characters from talking, instead it's done as a voice over and you get to see the actors express their emotions during these scenes... it really does an amazing job of showing how they feel regarding each other and their individual circumstances).
It keeps you hooked, you care about these people, you want to find out what happens to them.
(Sub Pro):  The amazon trailer for this movie is brilliant, artistic and makes you think ""What the heck is going on here"", I've seen other trailers for this movie that just don't have that hook at all.

Overall, I think this film (and the film maker) are amazing.  I admit, this is not going to be for everyone, and those that need a more coherent plot line in their movies may not find this to their taste at all.

After that ....its repetitive and gets old quickly.  I get the point and where they are going with this it just took entirely too long to get there.  I didn't feel a real connection between characters like I wanted to in order to get into the vibe the movie was trying to create.,1467763200,2,458,4.206896551724138
6818417,4,B00PMDSVTM,"I discovered Jamin Winans with his 2009 movie Ink, which is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The kind of movie that is better every time I watch it, and was so confusing in the first viewing that the final scenes were AMAZING and suddenly made sense.

This movie is like that. It's definitely a Winans film, with a very similar feel to it, but isn't so drastically sci-fi from the start. (It gets there.) Do I like it as much as Ink? Nope. But was it a good Monday morning? Absolutely.",1467763200,,498,4.242105263157895

It was, as described in the synopsis before the comments- a fantasy, thriller with religious overtones. It surely was a love story with lots of violence and killing. I thought it was going somewhere, but it eventually it lead to no where. I I felt it was a waste.

Where Ink was both visually and conceptually intriguing, The Frame only has minutes of visual creativity and lacks a plot worth following.

While I'd love to support independent film makers, perhaps there is something to be said for having an executive staff to stop half-cocked movies from being made. This story didn't have enough content for a feature-length film and would have been much more-interesting as a short. The whole story could have been told well in 20 minutes, and wouldn't leave the audience feeling as if they'd wasted their time.",1466726400,3,771,4.877862595419847

I will never look at the 16th Street Mall the same ever again. The writers are brilliant! I am super freaked out. I might need to seek professional help now. Ha. Whew. Well done!

You know that kid you've been at a party with who thinks he's being profound but he's just.. high. Unfortunately there is no metaphysical revelation here and people will not, hopefully, be talking about this movie for years.  The continuous flashback pacing becomes increasingly unbearable as the movie bogs down in its inability to execute the obvious ending.  The ""denouement"" is a drawn out fiasco that is supposed to be mind-blowing but as stated, is obvious and simply not entertaining. If you have never read a book about metaphysics or seen many good films this might be a new experience for you.  I've seen hundreds of movies in the Indie-Sci-fi genre and I would never consider recommending this movie to anyone.

The film starts out at a good pace and you are led through the story up to the point where you slowly realize what is going on. The idea of watching someone's life as a TV show has been done before, but the idea of a two way interaction between the characters is a little different. I guess the part that really didn't excite me was the endless backstory of the characters. It's one of those things where people with pretty decent present lives can't leave their pasts behind and move forward. That story line tended to drag the whole film down and it started getting really tiresome about halfway into it.

6818800,2,B00PMDSVTM,"The purpose of being a story teller is to make what you say resonate with your listener, or audience.  This seems like a piece that someone made as their own personal catharsis, and then didn't really care about whether or not it would matter to anyone else, or at least didn't take care to ensure that it did.  It's not a total disaster, but think about this.  Have you ever been listening to someone who is telling a story, and suddenly you realize that you just don't really care about it, and it just sort of feels like they're telling you the story because they, themselves want to hear it?  That's what watching this movie is like.  People who see something in this movie, I think, are just searching too hard.  It paints itself into a corner, and then pretends like it was a good idea.

The acting is so-so, with the male lead being slightly more believable than the female lead. The first 2/3 of the movie was great. I loved the framing and the sedate sound track. It fit the mood quite well. There is a pique of action and the rest of the movie drones. The last third of the movie could have been cut in half easily. There are some extraneous characters that I believe are meant to be derivative or metaphorical (psychiatrist and nurses, the hobo/devil?) They just feel out of place and uncomfortable. There aren't really any sci-fi qualities to the movie. I would label it as fantasy. Overall, it feels like the creators lost their way halfway through, and decided to see what weird stuff they could think up.",1452211200,,812,4.638888888888889

6818817,1,B00PMDSVTM,This movie has good potential but falls short of anything well written. The concept is not original which is fine but the failure to elaborate or theorize through the characters on the extraordinary situation exemplifies how poorly written this movie is. The dialogue is as bad as it gets. The acting is good but the lack of character and story development is painful. There are too many long quiet scenes that focus on the actor but fail to add anything to the character or story. This movie is like watching a casting reel at best. The sound track is almost non existent making it even more dull and boring then it already is.,1451952000,,628,4.566371681415929
6818818,5,B00PMDSVTM,"If you enjoyed INK, you will enjoy this one. It has a similar theme to it but a slightly different concept and twist to it all. Another reviewer suggested that the movie didn't explain enough, but that was also what was right about the movie. He lets YOU think about it and you CAN figure it out pretty simply enough (of course I won't here: Spoilers).

There is an end action scene that will be one of the most suspenseful things you have ever watched in a movie. It will have you edging up on your seat, leaning forward, putting your hands together, twisting them together, talking to the screen...

Likewise, the last part of the movie will be one of the most frustrating things you have watched as you literally feel what the character is feeling.

The simple question is should you choose this movie for your evening? If you are a fan of movies with a fantasy edge to them, like INK, Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth), Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie), or even Tarsem Singh (The Fall) then you most definitely should choose this movie. You will enjoy it. You will think about it. You will talk about it. Give it a try and you will likely recommend it to a friend.

One quasi-spoiler I have to mention: A reviewer here states that he doesn't get ""the mechanic"" and why he exists, etc. The character actually tells you who he is in the movie pretty bluntly enough. And that piece of the puzzle starts explaining the meaning of everything else.",1451779200,,1444,4.521072796934866

I could have done without the ""devil"" in the top hat. Overall a good story.",1451692800,,341,4.181818181818182

I get that that concept is supposed to be a scaffold, but I didn't particularly enjoy the attempt at deep symbolic meaning, either. Quite honestly, yawn. I'm not averse to slow-moving, if the film draws me in, but this one didn't. What little dialog there was, was repetitive and uninteresting. There was almost no character development, and I didn't care about them at all. (I did like the chipper receptionist. That actress and her hairdresser did a fine job. If you watch the trailer, you'll see her entire part.) There are a few interesting visuals, minimalist soundtrack over lots of breathless staring and banal slow, tentative walking/movement. All that ""breathing room"" felt like a film student trying to be Bergman, or trying to stretch a short story into a feature. Even the bits with some ""action"", such as Alex running into the edge of the frame, went on a bit too long and became annoyingly repetitive. Think Dianne Simmons' college indie film, ""Lint"", in Family Guy, only longer.",1451520000,6,1156,4.868020304568528

6818825,2,B00PMDSVTM,"It's hard to review a movie like this without inserting some spoilers, but I'll do my best.  Even trying to explain what works, and does not work, about this movie, is difficult without going into more details than a review should.

So I'll just say (in general terms) that ""The Frame"" would have made a good Twilight Zone episode, if it was about ninety minutes shorter.  In fact, it bears a resemblance to a Twilight Zone episode called ""Gabe's Story"" -- the difference being that ""Gabe's Story"" was fast paced and good humored. ""The Frame"" has a similar premise to GS, but I found it slow moving and monotonous. I had to force myself to watch it all the way to the end.

What I did like about it was the relationship drama, which was stronger in the male character's story than the woman's. His life, and what real or unreal experiences had made him the man he was, was well written. Hers was more vague and undefined... we needed more about her to connect with her on the same level that we connected with him.

I realize The Frame wasn't intended to be an effects-heavy movie and it shouldn't be judged primarily for the effects, but the ones that were used felt monotonous and poorly conceived, and tended to work against the mood of the story.  The cinematography was nice, but the effects tended to distract from the cinematographer's work.

Some reviewers have said The Frame is hard to follow.  People who watch a lot of science fiction will find it easy to follow, once the SF elements become apparent, but after that, I think, will find it dull and disappointing, and even irritating at times. People who don't watch or like SF may find the SF elements irritating and confusing.",1451347200,6,1690,4.572847682119205
6818826,5,B00PMDSVTM,As excellent as INK. The film has an ethereal feel and look. The artistry of the film shots is masterful and I love the unique use of color and texture as part of the film and not as just backdrops. Many of us have longed for years to see films that were not the usual and we have been now been graced. Hollywood lacks the imagination and artistic ability of the Winans. Special effects mean little unless they are done to look believable or completely unbelievable (in a good way) and the Winans skillfully employ them. The film is a treat for the mind and the eyes.,1451347200,,567,4.308411214953271

6818838,5,B00PMDSVTM,"Its rare that I even write a review, but this film is so compelling in its brilliance that I just had to put pen to paper and, in my limited command of the English language, try to give much deserved credit to a rara avis when spotted. The Frame by Jamin Winans is such an interesting piece of filmmaking that the viewer comes away at first relieved, then puzzled, and finally mesmerized. The unfortunate part of this composition is that many watchers might be too confused to stay with the movie until its denouement, thus depriving themselves of the inscrutable pleasure this original, sci-fi-wrapped-in-fantasy picture delivers.

I watched this movie for the third time last night on Christmas Eve, and as the other two times, I was not disappointed. Although this time I did watch the film with a more critical eyethe first time I was confounded, the second stupefiedI still came away with awe and admiration for Winans, who I believe will one day be feted for his cinematic accomplishments. The film is not perfect, but then again none is. This third viewing allowed me to spot some of these flaws, but none is so important to affect the beauty of this movie, nor detract from its inherently tender message.

What I love about Winans films is the way he elicits from us all the emotions along the continuum of human experience: angst, pity, sorrowand most of all love. In this story, the two lead characters are both troubled people living in parallel universes that impinge on one another, yet remain separate enough to prevent complete interaction. Alex, played by David Carranza, is part of a gang that hijacks trucks for their payloads; Sam, played by Tiffany Mualem, is a troubled EMT worker with a checkered past. Both are ashamed of their livesSam, for her past mistakes, and Alex for his undeserved orphan status resulting from the brutal assassination of his parents when he was a boy. They both desperately seek redemption.

Alex is looking to leave his current life and criminal association and get away from the drug cartels that took him in as their own. He has saved money and is looking to exit the country and disappear. There is one problem. He has a debt to one of the honchos, and word gets out to one of the lieutenants that Alex is looking to skip town. Alex is good at what he does and is a good earner for the cartel. He will not get off so easily. There is one big job coming down the pipeline and if Alex wants his freedom, he must do this last job. Yet it could mean his life.

Sam is a young, kind, and beautiful paramedic, who is ashamed of her trailer-park mother and tainted past. She seeks to redeem herself through her work, and in her first scene she is portrayed saving an abused mother from a collapsed trachea, all the while comforting the unconscious moms traumatized little girl. Outside of work, her life is simple. She lives alone in an apartment, sings to herself, has no attachments, and takes solace in watching a weekly crime show called Thieves and Saints.

Now this is where it gets interesting and where Winans weaves the sci-fi with fantasy with quantum-like field theory. I guess this is why also many viewers come away somewhat perplexed and really miss the core meaning of the film. While Alex is back in his apartment and resting on the sofa, he watches the same scene on TV that Sam just experienced in her lifeher saving of the mother whose trachea was bashed in by her drunken, abusive husband. This is when you as the viewer start to question what is going on. The internal dialogue goes something like this: Hey, wait a second. I just. . . I  just saw this. I don't understand. What is going on? You suddenly feel the pull of extradimensional space as though you somehow came close to a black hole. It seems strange but it grabs you. Although difficult, the astute viewer starts to piece together the intricately woven cloth that the filmmaker is crocheting from an interdimensional fabric.

If that scene is not outr enough, the next one certainly qualifies. While stirring from a doze with the TV left on, Alex sees Sam inside the screen, staring back at him. They both are aware that they can see each other, yet each is equally perplexed. When Sam utters a word and Alex hears it, he quickly slams the TV off. His paranoia over trying to leave the cartel has him believing that he is being surveilled. Over the next few frames we see Alex having these experiences several more timesafter having gone so far as to move into a hotel to get away from his possibly bugged apartmentuntil he finally accepts that something otherworldly is happening. Sam is in the same position.

You see, Samto Alexis Tiffany Mualem, star of Urban Hope, a weekly show about a loner paramedic, which Alex has been watching for its entire three-season run. Alexto Samis David Carranza, star of Thieves and Saints, which is wrapping up its fourth and last season with a cliff-hanging final episode that puts Alex in his most dangerous plight to date. Sams reality is Davids fiction and vice versa. The metaphysical has been transformedtheir destinies are on a collision course which can only be mediated by Godthe omniscient scriptwriterbut yet free will still exists.

Metaphors abound and Winans laces the film with a surrealism that harkens back to Dalis The Persistence of Memory, in his clever use of concepts of non-absolute time and frames of reference. You see, in Alexs frame of reference, he fantasizes about having a normal life with a beautiful girl like Sam; in Sams, she is in love with Alexs character on the show and dreams of being with someone like him, in spite of his checkered past. Together, they can redeem each other, but only if they can merge their two parallel universes.

I can go on and on about this movie and both its cleverness and meritsindeed write a treatise worthy of publication. Its touching and emotional moments are palpableyou feel the pain and yearning of the characters as they strive to make right what an unjust God has let happen. The musical score is touching, accentuating the tender moments in the right places and at the right times. The strange man in his circus-like tricycle, the inky soot throughout, the strange building lurking in the sky, that pesky violinall these creative elements and more lead us to the resounding resolution: love conquers all, and musicwith its vibrational frequenciescan even bridge two parallel universes.

This movie is not for everyone. Yet, the patient viewer, who refuses to succumb to the natural disquietude produced by such a cinematic earth-shaker, will come away with more than just enjoyment. He will have glimpsed another dimension where unseen energies define our very souls and the most fundamental forces rule. Watch it, enjoy it, discuss it.

My motivation is that I want to get feedback from others not just by their review but my synopsis of the movie. The movie is that perplexing, yet engaging, that I have to validate my read of it. So I encourage you to comment on my review... and who knows, it might give you an ""aha"" moment and in return, you might give me the same.
Before I jump into the ""my read of it"" part, just want to give a review to those who haven't seen and want to avoid spoilers. I liked it a lot. I love Jamin's movies because: 1) he is so damn creative, 2) he could go into business with just his musical scores as they are fantastic and 3) he makes you think and he never gives you a direct answer to what the hell just happened... you use your imagination to link it together.
This movie had me thinking a lot and asking ""why did...?"" and ""was that because of ...?"" (i.e. refer to my first sentence above).
Go watch it unless you prefer movies that spell out everything for you. Fantastic acting (better than Ink) and as with Jamin's movies, my emotions were left raw. He is incredible at tugging at those strings.

Ok... now spoilers and my read
============================================================================
Honestly, I should watch it again before I give my read and ask questions but I am plowing forward, so here goes
We, human individuals, live with challenges in our lives based on the past and present. Alex chose a more negative path forward while Sam looks for some way to redeem her past sins. Alex follows a script for his life because it is all he knows and he can't find a way out of his current path. He thinks about it and he wants to change it but some evil entity, the devil, is always there to nudge him down the script's path. It becomes a question of free will vs fate. Sam is seemingly nudged down her scripted path as well (in this case the devil is her psychiatrist who wants to give her meds to just keep moving along... ""nothing to see here folks, just move along"").  I see the world (or worlds) as a creation by God that humans struggle in but this struggle is primarily due to the devil who states that he won't be a puppet and he will do everything he can to tear it down (part of that tear down, I would guess, is like his nudges mentioned). My read anyway...
I see the two meeting via the TV as a mixed read. Either they use TVs shows as an outlet and what they would like to be, or might have been OR a method of illustrating how people can help each other to diverge from their scripted path.
Alex sees his uncle(?) in the hospital (or hospice) and sees how he bravely did the right thing and wants to do the same but can't. Sam now gives him the push he needs and she becomes a guardian angel of sorts. Alex finds it difficult to escape the devil's world and this is where he is caught in the frame of his existence. But Sam won't let him give up and she keeps fighting for him...
At some point Alex's uncle's words hit him or at least they are recanted (something to the effect that a light is shining on him, God is testing him so he can discover what he truly is and he needs to let go of the past) as Alex is carried back to his room. It is at this point that he reaches for his violin and starts playing. He is then returned to the scene where Sam is and the car does a flip before hitting her.
I read the violin as Alex doing what his true love is (no matter the script) but I am still unsure about the ending. Was it to illustrate that they needed each other to survive?

6818866,3,B00PMDSVTM,"Trippy, very David Lynch influenced (can clearly see the Lynch influence in the pace, acting, music, and shot framing). As in Lynch films, the plot gets too convoluted and muddled at times and things suffer when the director engages in ""look how weird and clever I can be"". Cutting thru all the peripheral  mind bending nonsense leaves a fairly straight story of imposed self limits (framing ones life within  self imposed boundary set by own life experiences), loneliness and alienation, and breaking the limits through hope and spiritual belief.  Somehow, I have a feeling that the makers of this film are people sympathetic to Scientology by the sublime messages in the movie as well as how it shows phychology and use of anti-depressant medication as bad things (just my feeling as I in no way am an expert in Scientology).The trouble with these  movies is that in trying so hard to be ""trippy"", it vacillates wildly between smartly clever to nonsensical.

6818896,3,B00PMDSVTM,"The premise is terrific. The acting is not entirely terrible, but it is low-key enough that there is portrayed a noticeable lack of intensity of emotional depth. Part of that is certainly intentional, but Carranza could have picked up a bit more from ""The Blade Runner"" when it comes to portraying the characters in such a manner, I think. The film definitely has that low-budget B-movie feel, shot mostly in one location, with just a few characters to follow. The AI characters, on the other hand, and very notably, are worth the price of admission, so to speak, but you maybe need to see it to find out why.

And in the end, the implication of the ending is also worthwhile, although I don't think it's a slam dunk that everyone will ""get"" it, but it explains the title.

And one day, the two realize they can communicate via their televisions. Sounds like a light romantic comedy, a la Joss Whedon's In Your Eyes, but with both shows being dark and gritty dramas, a happy ending may not be in order.

As with Ink, music plays a huge part, and Winans as a composer is as good here as he's ever been. Add to that some very slick visuals, especially toward the back end of the film, and The Frame could have easily stood up against major theater releases.

It isn't until the man returns to who he really is, that he can be in the same place as she, and they can connect. Music is their vehicle to contact -and to open doors to each other -freeing them from their victimhood.
I don't know if any of this was the goal...but this was my take away.

It's clever without trying to be too much, and while it hits some of its budget limits for effects and shots in ways that seem obvious, the story and characters bring it through.

Make sure to adjust your back pillows carefully before you start watching -- because you will soon be launched into a Russian Doll House of Mirrors.

First, a crucial question not to be overlooked: Why didn't they fix the backwards ""E"" in the title before they went to print?  Right there, you can see the post-production was a little careless, which was our only complaint about this film.  [Don't they have any sensitivity for those of us with dyslexia?]

We really enjoyed the the toilet paper interior set design that made it seem almost like a boxing ring, but not. REALLY COOL MAN.

Thanks to this movie, my theories about psychiatrists have been prove true! Definitely not worth the time or money to see one of those NUTS!

The sub-plot teaches that crime doesn't pay and occasionally people go ""poof"" and transform into pools of airborne black oil.  This is something we've read about and heard about for YEARS...and finally it has been proven to really exist.

This was a fantastic and super-educational documentary that left us with a cute cases of PTSD.  When we sign off from writing this review we are going to admit ourselves to the hospital, so don't worry you will be safe and sound in your little warm bed tonight.  Hopefully, the movie won't be playing in at the infirmary, 'cause that would be really twilight-zoney!

P.S. Does ANYONE know a good television repairman? My husband just went berzerk and smashed our TV with a frying pan. (I think he was REALLY inspired by this movie, and your man might be too.)",1443916800,3,1714,4.769491525423729

Certainly not for the most challenged of us in any way.  It is like it runs all over itself with puzzling and disconnected montages cut in with pseudo cutting-edge esoterica, progressed by some kind of suggestively dark gray mood music and that in itself seems little more than an embarrassingly arrogant and offensive trick.  After ten or so minutes I was so exasperated that I could not take any more and shut it off.  If someone believes, really believes, that what they have is truly something to offer audiences, they do not have to resort to cheap cinematic tricks to reel the viewer in.  It sells itself on its own merits.  That seems sorely lacking in this mess of a film, if one could deign to even call it that.

If the producers hired an editor to go at it again, there could be a real piece of art here, on par with any other provoking, original work.

But much of the acting was so poor it repeatedly pulled me out of the film; the pace was too slow; and it was 45 minutes too long.

I'm an American who really enjoys the slower pacing of art films or European cinema, the Clooney Solaris being a favorite of mine: but at points I was so frustrated it was all I could do to not yell at the screen, ""HURRY UP!""

I think there were literally only 4 things that happened in the last 40 minutes of the movie. The points and the meaning could have been communicated effectively with less attachment to the material and more precision in script and film editing.

(e.g. the violin)  Jamin Winans  writes, directs and scores his work and the attention to detail really shines through because of the directors singular vision.  (e.g. the purple lights in the apartment hallways have different hues for each reality)  I am a sappy guy at times and like Ink this movie made me gush at times due to the quality of acting and writing.

6819173,5,B00PMDSVTM,"I think this is an extraordinarily good movie, for a movie which is clearly so small.  I don't want to say too much about it, because almost anything you could say about it would be a spoiler.  I think the acting is very good, but what makes the movie great is the novelty of its story.  Parts of the story have been done before, but not quite like this, so I don't really see this as being derivative.  The Amazon Prime blurb for it, which is the only thing I knew about the movie before watching it --- which I only did because it seemed to be science-fictional in nature --- is so woefully inadequate that there's no way to guess that the story is in any way novel.  I suppose that given the awful nature of the Amazon Prime blurb and, perhaps, the relatively slow way story progresses, many people might bail out before watching enough to know that it was even interesting.  And indeed, it is relatively slow throughout, but I don't think that's a problem, because the characters are appealing, and what you're watching is the characters reacting to the science-fictional events occurring around them.  The only real complaint I have is the ""happy ending"", since it seems out of place, but the fact is that I really only like happy endings so I can't even complain about that.

I highly recommend this movie, though you have to have an adequate attention span if you're going to enjoy it.",1438214400,4,1392,4.496031746031746

6819178,5,B00PMDSVTM,"An engrossing an thoughtful depiction. It is loaded with enough technique and artistic style to make a film student swoon, yet is still clever and mainstream enough to make a watchable film. Notice I say ""film"" not movie. This is a film. This is NOT a Hollywood-mainstream, focus-group, audience-surveyed action/gore/sex romp ""movie.  The players are relative unknowns but deliver, in my opinion, sterling performances.  David Carranza plays Alex, an immigrant orphan, fallen into bad circumstance and tortured by the life he's forced into and the beautiful Tiffany Mualem, is Sam, who displays real depth as a woman trying to make a better future; both haunted by a troubled past.
There are so many interwoven themes:  Issues of destiny and past, choice and fate and common bonds of love and loyalty, humanity versus freewill and determinacy and spirituality (cleverly expressed as music) make this a multi-viewing.

Some reviewers have commented that the audio was not good, that some things were missed, not clear, or out of sync. Some have said the pacing was awkward at times and blame acting, writing or direction. I can't disagree more. This is a piece about life. Life is not paced like a movie or TV show. It is clear that a tremendous amount of thought and care went into this film. Every element of this production is clearly an attempt at mastery. This was a ""showpiece"", a labor of love. So, while it exists;, it is not a flaw or oversight. Nope. I get it. It's filmmaker ""device"". Low audio portions, and minor sync errors draw you in. They force you to perk-up, and lean in. They draw you in and make you pay attention.(Usually because something important is worth noting)  Reason: The first thing you will notice.while watching at certain times, is the camera, swaying in and out, like it is mounted on a raft in the ocean, filming the scene on shore. You can almost hear the surf, it is barely subliminal) The audio and the sync, (I feel), is an attempt toward the projecting of the theme.

Resolution. That's the ticket. The carnival ride they had to take in order to meet each other was all the fun, for the viewer. For them it was pure hell. Look for a strange demon or the devil riding on some wheeled contraption using a hose to pour ink on things. High speed chases. Gun battles. Fighting. Domestic violence.

6819216,5,B00PMDSVTM,"This movie was SO genius - I would think anyone would end up appreciating it on some level. It was one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen - I had to admire the writer, because of the way he showed you how very fragile the human psyche can be, and how interconnected our experience.

The two main characters question their own reality and that of the other, which is made more difficult when they seek to find each other and can't, and yet they know things about the other which is seemingly impossible. It's all very mind boggling!  I'm not sure if this movie is  described as sci-fi, but it's certainly a real mind bender - very different, but one of those movies I know I won't forget, and I don't say that about movies very often!

I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but I will give some basics ... there are two primary characters, one male and one female. They seem to be stuck in what I'd say are parallel, but alternate realities. They experience the other without being able to physically being able to reach the other, but at a certain point feel an almost desperate need to find the other.

One is sane but is written as crazy and begins to feel crazy and runs from the craziness. The other is good and just but feels bad, and takes on the guilt and shame of a lifetime - that causes them to seem locked in a prison of their own being from which they can't escape. As desperation sets in for both of them, they frantically want to save the other.

The devil is in the details.

Remember, if something seems slow, there might be important content happening that won't be relevant til' you get the message. Be patient.

I can't say that for some of the other characters who seemed a little amateurish in their deliveries. The production values were very good and I loved the music score. As the film jumped back and forth to establish the plot line, I did find myself drifting occasionally and rewound to catch up the with story. The way the main characters interacted with each other kind of reminded me of an old Twilight Zone (circa latter 50s early 60s) episode. Interacting via television screens was clever and intriguing.

6819289,4,B00PMDSVTM,"I'm a huge fan of Jamin Winans' work and greatly enjoyed ""The Frame"". That said it is not without it's problem (I'll try to explain as spoiler free as possible). The main issue is pacing. The move spends about the first hour establishing the framework and rules that govern the universe of the movie. Some of it is very clever but often it seems like you're watching the two main characters repeat the same scene over and over again. Once the movie gets going, it rolls along much quicker. Again, it lags a bit at the end but it's not very noticeable (and very slight compared to the first hour).

That said, the movie is still very amazing. The visuals are great and the concept is going to keep me coming back again. While Winans' previous work, ""Ink"", was very surreal, it essentially the story of parental love. ""The Frame"" is so much larger and more complex that I was not prepared for it. There are no quick answers and in some cases the questions aren't even clear. It's very clever and will likely be viewed several times (I suspect I may even pour over the first, slower, hour.

What I saw here is exactly what I wanted: some of the same themes, but not all; more risks, deeper exploration; something that got at that labyrinthine complexity that arises in movies where the border breaks down between fantasy and reality.

I honestly don't think it's much of a SPOILER to reveal that once you're done with this movie, you don't exactly feel like you've been proselytized to, but you will have got as big a dose of basically Christian religion as you would get from reading/watching The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe. While I'm not opposed to that, it's also not something I associate with films I enjoy. But for many reasons, I enjoyed this film and its take on the questions of religion and philosophy, it tackles with a nuanced blend of playfulness and seriousness which, maybe most of all, is what distinguishes this film as a genuine work of art, and at the same explores the subject of free will and creativity in a way that makes it exactly the sort of picture I love.",1431302400,7,1253,4.41991341991342

When I first read the descriptions and watched the trailer[which is terrible by the way] I was put off and almost didn't watch it. I am more of a hard Scifi fan, meaning I like some science behind the plot but this movie overcomes that and transcends the physical into the metaphysical creating a sense of wonder about our reality. It may not be for you if what I said puts you off, but it is a very creative and entertaining movie on many levesl. I would recommend you give it a watch. It does require a suspension of logic but then anyone who is a reader of modern physics knows that reality is far from what we can perceive with or senses so use that as an excuse to overcome the barriers of logic.

Leads David Carranza and Tiffany Mualem are both new to me (Carranza has played small parts on The Blacklist and recently on Elementary) but certainly turn in excellent performances here.

6819365,3,B00PMDSVTM,"I like science fiction and offbeat movies, but this one did not work for me. Perhaps, it was because the filmmakers emphasis was on the visual elements rather than the dialogue or plot. The cinematography is excellent and the actors are captivating, but ultimately it did not hang together for me in a coherent way.

The story opens with Alex participating in a cargo heist and then moves to Sam, a female paramedic. It turns out that each of them are watching each others lives as television shows.  They are both captivated by each others television shows, Alex by Sam in ""Urban Hope"" and Sam by Alex in ""Thiefs and Saints."" Then they start to communicate with each other through their television sets, which, reasonably, freaks them out.  Trying to connect the dots, Alex determines that Sam is an actress named Tiffany Mualem, and there is a Tiffany Mualem in his world, and, in fact, Sam is actually played by the actress Tiffany Mualem. But Sam is not Tiffany Mualem, and they can't ever seem to be in the same place.

So, that part is fun.

Then, the flick depends into the Kafkaesque theater of the absurd. It seems that the world, Alex's world at least is breaking down, and his show is coming to an end.  Sam has her own problems, and it seems that the production company has a surrealistic device that...what?...channels stories from alternate universes?....and at that point the viewer is left to their own devices.  The dialogue comes to an end, the visual elements become overwhelming and the viewer is invited/allowed/required to interpolate a conclusion.

Honestly, I am not sure that the effort is worth the return.  I liked Donnie Darko for the ""what did I miss"" quality, but I didn't get that from this movie.

If you are a fan of surreal movies that you write your own conclusion for, then this is your movie.  If you want a more traditional story, then you should give it a miss.",1427500800,,1900,4.658682634730539

Also, wtf happened to 'the devil' - he had a cool speech and then...yeah >_>

Having said that, Ink is a hard act to follow - this is a show you kind of have to see for yourself; IMO, the climactic scene with the EMT and the script is, by itself, worth the price of admission. This movie felt a little unfocused, but I didn't regret watching it, and will probably watch it again some time when the stars are right. I have a feeling it may be an acquired taste.

6819394,5,B00PMDSVTM,"Jamin Winans has done it again!  He blew my mind.  I have probably watched the movie over ten times now and I'm still trying to figure it out.

The movie follows a very interesting Christian allegory like Ink did.  Instead of witnessing the spiritual battle, we get to see from the perspective of God himself within this film.  For a theme, the movie does an okay job explaining why God allows bad things to happen (primarily focused on the free will and to test humans aspect of said argument).  However, the film also leaves it a little open ended.  Like I said, I haven't completely figured it out yet.  I also like Winan's take on the devil, although menacing it also comes across as fittingly comical.

This film is a significant improvement from Ink in terms of cinematography, special effects, and so on...  It looks like a very polished film.  I'm surprised it wasn't picked up for a wider release.",1423872000,,906,4.6

6819396,2,B00PMDSVTM,"One gets the feeling that Jamin Winans got a laundry list of criticisms from his previous film INK and tried to make a more mass audience friendly picture with THE FRAME.  I loved INK.  For me, that film has a very special personal/spiritual resonance to it, and despite any awkwardness of style, it had such a strong emotional message about redemption that I feel it is one of, if not the best indie fantasy films ever made.  I covered it lovingly on my youtube review channel.  I'd been looking forward to the Frame for the past few years but when I finally sat down to watch it, I was blown away by the superficial level it took with it's storytelling, implying a link between worlds that makes the plight of each central character meaningless by comparison. Breaking the fourth wall for 2 hours without a satisfying punchline. Don't get me wrong, this film is expertly done for a small budget, it's exciting and tense, but there are no arcs for the characters and no resolution to the problem. What I get from the FRAME is that Jamin Winans wants to work in television, and I think the Frame could have easily been cut to be an hour length pilot, or a 20 minute short.  Definitely rent it first.",1423094400,7,1199,4.481651376146789
6819397,5,B00PMDSVTM,"If you loved ""Ink"" and queued up ""The Frame"" for round two of awesome, then you might be in for a bit of a shock--at first. ""The Frame"" is a powerful, hypnotic vehicle that takes a familiar story and weaves it into a surreal event. The layers of the story within the story are so well written that you're never lost but want to know more. Tour de force performances by David Carranza and Tiffany Mualem, and the soundtrack was well chosen.",1422230400,16,439,4.365853658536586
6819398,3,B00PMDSVTM,I am a big fan of INK and so it was hard not to compare this movie with INK. Good stylizing and music but the storyline was not as strong as I would have liked. Found it a little confusing.,1421712000,,189,3.75
6819399,5,B00PMDSVTM,"Jamin Winans' followup to the inconsistent but fascinating INK represents a huge advance on nearly all technical levels (he was already a thoroughly accomplished composer). It has striking visuals, virtuoso action sequences, and a strong, emotionally engaging (and ultimately quite moving) story populated by fine performances by largely unknown actors.

But that's not why it's a masterpiece and likely one of the 25 best sci-fi films ever. This is simply one of the thematically richest and most resonant films of all time. The fantasy or sci-fi premise (as in INK, it's technically the former but feels utterly like the latter) works profoundly well as a metaphor for human psychological damage, isolation, and connection. But at the same time, on another level entirely, it's a metaphysical exploration of the nature of free will and of God. And the two ways of reading the movie's deeper meaning play off one another continually. I even suspect that, as with all the greatest art, there are valid readings other than any that Winans intended; the metaphors and metaphysics are that rich.

The film does have a very varied pace as part of its design, so it will help to have a decent tolerance (if not fondness for) the not-infrequent ""slow"" sequences. Given that, I believe this will thoroughly entertain those merely looking for a cool story with a strong mind-bending, WTF? aspect, but it's also a film you can spend hours talking about, unraveling its meanings on many levels. Indeed, I suspect we'll be talking about it for years.",1421280000,64,1539,5.031372549019608
6819400,4,B00PMDSVTM,"THE FRAME is the second film from writer-director Jamin Winans and it represents a significant improvement over its predecessor, INK, on all fronts. The basics of the plot, which is very hard to describe as it is without giving away too much information, is that there are two people, Alex and Sam, who are each going through some difficulties in their lives. Through some weird turn of events they end up meeting and eventually help each other come to terms with their pasts and current realities. I'm possibly missing something, but that was the gist of what I got out of it. The film speaks to the theme of our past defining who we are, to ourselves and others. Both Alex and Sam are in situations that they feel trapped in because of where they've been, but it takes meeting the other to discover that they are the authors of their own stories. And somehow, a dirty, black-clad man with a wrinkled hat who sprays ink on things has something to do with it. I think that to really grasp the fullness of what Winans is doing here requires more than one viewing, and I'll probably return to it at some point. For now, though, I'm just digesting it. In comparison to INK, though, THE FRAME is a much better film. It benefits from a slightly bigger budget, and the camerawork and editing are all improved. Even the acting, while not spectacular, is better than it was in INK. There aren't a whole lot of visual effects, but one effect of people turning into ink did look pretty cool. There's also some playing around with aspect ratios towards the end. Overall, THE FRAME was a visually creative, unique sci-fi/fantasy film that explores themes of redemption and overcoming doubts with sensitivity and a little flair. If you liked INK, then you should check this out but I would also recommend it to anyone who wants something the likes of which they haven't seen before.",1421280000,,1869,4.615615615615615
6819401,5,B00PMDSVTM,"What a wonderful film!  I think the soundtrack/score for the film was beautifully done as well.  I am a big fan of Jamin Winans films, and first started with his film *Ink*.  I had been anticipating the release of *The Frame* for quite some time, and I was not disappointed.  A surreal and beautiful film I would recommend to anyone!",1420848000,,333,4.5
6819402,5,B00PMDSVTM,"This was one of the most original movies I have ever seen.  If you like brain-benders, you'll like this.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is the over-use of the F-word throughout, it added nothing to the movie.",1420848000,,225,4.333333333333333
6819403,2,B00PMDSVTM,"Before I dive into the meat of the review let me start with my credentials.  I loved ""Ink"" (Winan's first film).  I watched it multiple times, and even got the soundtrack.  I love sci-fi, fantasy, augmented reality, horror, and have no problem with intelligent low budget films.  I thought ""Primer"" was amazing and even liked its sequel, the amorphous ""Upstream Color"".  In a similar vein, ""Donnie Darko"" might be my favorite movie.  Needless to say, I was excited about ""The Frame"".

And I was very disappointed.  In a nutshell, the problem seems to be that in the quest for deep symbolic meaning the writers neglected to include an actual story, or at least neglected to finish the one they started.  The last third of the movie was an incomprehensible mish-mash of hokey catch phrases and inexplicable events.  As someone who likes open ended films this was not deeply symbolic or metaphorical, just bad.

The main problems seem to be with the writing and editing.  The movie was about an hour longer than it needed to be.  There were long interludes of the main character staring off into space, for no real reason.  The plot dragged horribly in the middle.  Then, just as you think its about to get good, it gets weird instead.

The two protagonists, especially the woman, did not seem to have much motivation and received little in the way of development.  In fact, it seems like they abandoned the story of the woman (the EMT) midway through.  The ancillary characters (the old guy, the psychiatrist, the hat guy) were clearly intended to have symbolic meaning (god? society? the devil?), but never given actual roles.  As a result, they just hover around in the periphery, repeating laughable catch phrases.

A lot of reviewers have commented on the music.  Its okay, but too similar to his last work.  By similar I mean he basically remixed the soundtrack to Ink.  In some places the similarity is so apparent it becomes distracting.  It is admirable that Winans composes his own music, but he really needed to explore new territory here.

The acting and effects were fine, good even. In many places it had a similar look and feel to Ink, although without the menagerie of interesting looking characters.  There were a few nice stylistic touches (the lady at the desk, people turning into clouds of paint), but these became meaningless in the face of clunky editing and a poor script.

If you're interested in cerebral sci-fi and haven't seen ""Ink"" yet go do that - it is a far better film.  Otherwise, skip this head scratcher and find something with more established credentials.  A few that spring readily to mind are Upstream Color, Holy Motors, and Donnie Darko.",1420675200,18,2676,4.794310722100657
6819404,5,B00PMDSVTM,"**QUICK REVIEW** (which is what everybody is looking for):
- I watched (purchased - no regrets) this movie because it was from the same crew that brought Ink, my all time favorite.
- Starts out slow, but you know something is building, so you can't stop watching.
- In the end, it doesn't really make sense...doesn't really answer any questions you had while watching But that doesn't matter because...
- Great producing, soundtrack, use of cameras (how the hell did they do shoot some of the scenes???)
- It took me through an awesome emotion roller coaster, one that I liked.
- I felt uplifted, happy, and imaginative at the end.

Great movie Watch it. If you stumbled upon this and you don't like it, then I don't know how you stumbled upon it in the first place.",1419811200,29,766,4.550724637681159

6819406,5,B00PMDSVTM,"I'm not gonna write an bloated review.  I loved this film, as I do the other work of this talented creative team.  Is the movie perfect, no, but it is head-and-shoulders above the cookie cutter stuff that Hollywood mostly spews these days.  It's most definitely worth the money.

Also, the soundtrack is amazing, Winans is as talented a composer as he is a filmmaker.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1418515200,45,409,4.704225352112676

8688812,5,B00PMDSVTM,"The fact that this movie got such a span of different ratings says right there that you could get anything from this film. I thought it was very well produced and directed, and the actors were great. The core idea behind the script can really make you think and wonder, but only if you're open enough to do so. It was never predictable, yet it was never so profound and unexpected that it couldn't be followed or understood. I'd like to give a big thanks to the universe also for the odd synchronicity that occurred when my internet glitched (wifi hotspot/phone died) right when things were glitching so to speak on the screen, with the protagonist getting ""boxed in"" between the viewed frame.",1533772800,,693,4.642276422764228

8688819,1,B00PMDSVTM,"Wow, that was totally pointless. All this implied back story with no fulfillment. All this imagery implying Deeper Meaning that ends up having No Meaning. All this micron-deep character development of characters who end up being disposable anyway. Yik. Look, guys. I already saw _Vanilla Sky_. I had no reason to see it again.

This thing looked like some crew tried to put together a heist movie and another crew tried to create a psychedelic experience, but neither team could pull it off. The producers didn't want all that labor going to waste, so they threw both scripts into a hopper and this turkey came out. For a while it seemed that this flick might actually go somewhere, but it was not to be.

Hey, guys? Visuals no longer make a film. You actually have to have the story go somewhere to be successful. Better luck next time.",1530748800,4,837,4.648648648648648
8688820,4,B00PMDSVTM,"While ideas of God or fate may come up, I latch onto the film's address of the controls we necessarily allow to crop our lives. While we watch the character's emotional journeys, the audience's experience is purely intellectual, which is the main limitation of the film. The relationship element of the movie seems more a vehicle for the story than the center, so I'm glad they kept to their real purpose by not including mushy stuff that would have muddled everything. It's about freedom of the self not being fulfilled by others. One other criticism, personally, is that I find it moves rather slow and the scenes of literally fighting the frame seem a bit gimmicky.",1530230400,,668,4.767241379310345
