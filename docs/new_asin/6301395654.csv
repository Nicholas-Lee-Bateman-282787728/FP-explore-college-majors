7812247,5,6301395654,"I highly recommend this video of Professor Irwin Corey performing his wonderfully zany ""Nutty Professor"" stand-up comedy routine. He is my all-time favorite ""Nutty Professor"" comedian which is tragically a form of comedy that is currently virtually extinct as the dinosaurs.
  Professor Irwin Corey expostulates upon some pseudo-academic subjects and social commentary by employing confusing double-talk, risque' innuendoes, and ad hoc non sequiturs. He displays an exceptionally unique and unforgettable style of comedy.",1218844800,3,521,6.123287671232877
