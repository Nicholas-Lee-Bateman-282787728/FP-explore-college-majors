3719878,4,B001NMT8WA,"This is truly a legendary game which is much more enjoyable in color.  There are several players, announcers, and fans that describe their experiences.  If you want to understand the NFL in the 50s, this is it.",1236038400,,210,4.648648648648648
3719879,4,B001NMT8WA,"Having listened to the original game on radio as it was blacked out on TV in New York, I always wondered how certain plays looked. This was a wonderful DVD of a legendary game, but I wished they cut some of the commentary by actual players and current players and showed the entire game on kinescope, or however it was preserved. A must for any fan who wonders how the NFL became such a force in America.",1234828800,2,404,4.259740259740259
3719880,5,B001NMT8WA,"For all football fans, this is a ""must see"" classic.  I played against many of these guys.  This was the game that put the NFL on the map!",1234137600,2,138,3.892857142857143
3719881,5,B001NMT8WA,I watched this on ESPN and had to buy the DVD. It never gets old. I liked the way they presented it in color. It was great to see players and announcers from the game (and even some fans) to talk about how they felt. I also liked the way they compared the NFL today to how it was then. It was also good to see after 50 years once and for all whether or not Frank Gifford got the first down. It's a great DVD for any football fan.,1234051200,2,429,3.7777777777777777
3719882,3,B001NMT8WA,"It's great to have another look at this landmark game, and the colorization didn't bother me as much as I thought it might. But the disconnect the other reviewers noted between the generations of players was quite evident; it seems forced or contrived a bit. And Chris Berman had no business being a part of this production. Why was he standing in Monument Park talking about a football game?

Less hokum, more solid production. The game, and the players, need no artificial assistance.

Don't get me wrong: This DVD is definitely worth having if you are a fan of either team, or of football from that era. But a more-classic NFL Films treatment, instead of ESPN's heavy-handedness, would be a more-fitting tribute to this most-important game.",1233532800,10,743,4.888888888888889
3719883,5,B001NMT8WA,The DVD was reasonably priced and just what I hoped it would be and expected.,1233532800,,77,4.2
3719884,5,B001NMT8WA,Disc presents the great plays of the most classic and historical NFL Championship game ever played.  Plus interviews shown with those who played in this game explain which plays worked and why.,1233360000,,193,5.03125
3719885,2,B001NMT8WA,"It's interesting. But I have problems with having players from the Indianapolis team interviewing the greats of this game is if they have ties to the Baltimore team. They have the same nickname. That's it. The Baltimore Colts are gone, replaced by the Ravens. It's amazing to me that ESPN and the NFL try to make Indianapolis carry a legacy they know nothing about? Too bad Baltimore's football history, nickname and legacy didn't stay in town like the NFL did for Cleveland. But it is nice to have the Baltimore Colts remembered like this.",1230681600,7,540,4.75531914893617
3719886,5,B001NMT8WA,"The ESPN special that aired nationally on December 13, 2008, was a fabulous walk onto a gridiron of dreams and the piecing together of an incredible historical moment for professional football.

In cooperation with NFL Films, ESPN Films produced this special look back on the 1958 NFL Championship, which was captured in overtime by the visiting Baltimore Colts over the New York Giants, 23-17, in the cavernous Yankee Stadium, with a powerful one-yard run by fullback Alan Ameche.

Utilizing a number of sources for film, NFL Films essentially rebuilt the game; it was mastered for HD and digitally colored. Host Chris Berman fills in the gaps in the play and smartly tackles the task in a low-key, serious approach.

For additional commentary, players from the contest are teamed with players from the recent Super Bowl championship squads of the Giants and Indianapolis Colts. Colts legend Art Donovan and the recently retired Giants great Michael Strahan steal those segments through solid takes and allowing their great personalities to reach paydirt.

Kickers Pat Summerall and Adam Vinatieri - another Giants-Colts pairing - provide valuable insight on this often overlooked specialty. The excitement and appreciation for the game shows with cerebral Colts coach Tony Dungy and the vivid details from radio announcer Bob Woolf is worth the price of admission.

A fascinating look into the science of measuring a first down from a half-century ago is explained through a controversial run by Frank Gifford, as the Giants failed to put the game on ice as the clock ticked down to the closing minutes. In the melee - which included a delay due to Colt defensive end Gino Marchetti breaking his leg - allegations flew from the Giants that the football was moved back by a Colt player or the spot was incorrect by officials. Technology definitely answers the questions surrounding the play.

An estimated 45 million people watched the game on TV, but it was blacked out in the greater New York City area because it was not sold out. And if a pulled plug wasn't fixed in a unique way during overtime, NBC may have had a mess of ""Heidi Bowl"" proportions.

Summerall joked about the number of people who have told him that they attended the game. Through this DVD, future generations will have a real cozy seat for one grand slam of a duel on the frozen tundra in ""The House That Ruth Built.""",1229212800,11,2391,4.903465346534653
3719887,4,B001NMT8WA,"I watched this last night on ESPN and found it to be very entertaining and informative. Being a football fan starting in the early 1960's I saw some of these guys play on TV. I gave it only four stares because I think that there was maybe a bit too much talking. Most of the modern players seemed to have a difficult time relating to the football world of the past (There's a big shock). ""You mean you had to ger a job on the off season!?"" ""You made how much!?"" ""How could you play with no grass on the field?"" Nobody actually said these thing, but you know that's exactlly what they were thinking. It was a pretty sloppily played game, but it brought Pro football to everyone's attention like never before. A real kick start you might say. So, in that respect, the title is  more than appropriate.",1229212800,2,798,4.32
8327475,5,B001NMT8WA,"This game changed the entire pro football world. It opened up the world to the game and induced some smart businessmen to begin their own league which eventually transformed into today's pro football world. This game leashed upon the football world one of, if not the greatest, quarterback in football.",1432252800,,302,5.06

8327477,5,B001NMT8WA,"I have and always will insist that the Colts Should always be considered the most important team in the history of not only the NFL,but all of professional sports. In attendance at Yankee Stadium during this historic game was Lamar Hunt. Hunt was so moved by this electrifying game that he founded the AFL.And because this game fed Hunt's brainchild which also created the Super Bowl,I reiterate that the Colts are the most influential team in the history of organized sports.",1327881600,,476,4.888888888888889
8327478,3,B001NMT8WA,"It is ok. I do enjoy  the banter with the present Giants and the players of 1958. It is more of a Baltimore Colt Tribute. I do not like it colorized. I am looking for the game that they showed on ESPN on New Years Eve in 2008. This was not it. There has to be a more complete film in B&W some were out there. If your a Giant fan I say NO to this one, but it's up to you. The interviews with Lindon Crow were very good though. Plus I don't care for Len Berman in this one.",1317859200,,471,3.6633663366336635
8327479,5,B001NMT8WA,"Having been a fan of Pro Football for over 35 years, but having the major problem of living in the UK, I have followed the fortunes of the Packers through thick and thin since 1976, but, as I enjoy reading about the history of the NFL, I have always had a fascination for the ""Greatest Game Ever Played"" and have bought a CD of the game and as many books on the subject as have been published, I think.

To have a DVD of the highlights of the game was a dream come true, even though I had to buy a multi-zone DVD player to watch it. Going through the two teams' rosters, it is very sad to see how few of the players remain. Accordingly, a chance to see quite a few of them was a real treat, as their names are rather more familiar to me than they are to many (indeed, the vast majority of) people living in the UK. Frank Gifford may be fairly familiar to many as a commentator, and some in the UK may have heard of Johnny Unitas, but, really, that is about all, except for those fanatics like me.

The colouring of the film works very well, in my opinion, but I was, initially, concerned at the idea of having current players of the teams involved talking to the old players. Well before the end, however, I found that to add an entirely new level to the DVD. The current players seemed to treat their older counterparts with a great deal of respect (and so they should!).

Whilst realising that there are not so many people in the UK interested in the history of the game, for anyone with my degree of interest in a very important game (really not the ""Greatest"", thanks mainly to all the fumbles)this is a ""must-buy"". This DVD gives you a chance to see some great players at their peak, and that cannot be a bad thing.

PS On a separate tack, why are Ken Anderson and Jerry Kramer not in the Hall of Fame?",1304294400,,1807,4.183908045977011
8327480,1,B001NMT8WA,"I was hoping that a definative epic would have been made to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the most famous single game in NFL history. Instead we got the INDY Colts? W H A T?

ESPN had the 1958 players sitting with the modern Giants and Indy Colts talking about the game. Pat Sumerall and Adam Vinatieri was painful to watch as the connection simply could not be made. Why was it tried? This idea really needed to die in the first production meeting but somehow actually got carried out.

Think how lame this will look in 5 years when Adam Vinatieri (the NE Patriot) somehow is linked to the Colts - Giants game of 1958. This was pitiful. (Yes he was a Colt at the time of production, but he will forever be remembered as a NE Patriot.)

This illustrated how absurd it is to link the Indy Colts to the Baltimore Colts. Now that Indy has it's own Superbowl victory and legacy of great players, it no longer needs Baltimore's history. Jimmy Ersay should do the right thing and give Baltimore it's history back. The folks of Indy have never cared about the Baltimore Colts and still don't. According to the League, Gino Marchetti, Art Donovan, Lenny Moore, Johnny Unitas, Raymond Berry, Jim Parker, and John Mackey are all time Indianapolis Greats? Even the most die hard Indy fans acknowledge that this is S T U P I D !

ESPN's Chris Berman seems to be a nice fellow. His jovial style is great for highlights and bloopers. As always Berman did a fine job. While Berman is impressive I believe another opportunity was lost here. Pat Sumerall would have been my 1st choice as this would bring together his legendary career as a Sportscaster and player. If not Sumerall, Sam Huff or Frank Gifford, who all starred in the game. (All are polished sportscasters).

What was needed was the full NFL Films treatment. What we got was a ""trying to be hip"" hodge podge that did little justice to the importance and legacy of this game.

Admittedly my expectations were probably set way too high as I was convinced that the 50th Anniversary (the last milestone anniversary that most of the players will see before they pass on) would have been the best. The 40th Anniversary NFL Films production with John Steadman, Johnny Sample, Raymond Berry, Pat Sumerall, Frank Gifford and Sam Huff was much better. It is included in the Colts History DVD set.(Baltimore Disk)

The only reason this video gets even ONE STAR is they did settle the Gifford first down controversy. (Now with that settled...why did the Giants punt?)  Overall this video is a huge opportunity missed. Again the 40th Anniversary production remains the best account of this game.

Hey NFL: Give Baltimore their history back, and next time leave the football documentaries to the folks that invented them...NFL Films.",1262304000,15,2772,4.68724279835391
8327481,2,B001NMT8WA,Sports Illustrated named this game the best of all the NFL games played.  I wanted a DVD that shows the complete game including the audio without interruption.  This version does neither.,1253836800,5,187,5.0
8327482,5,B001NMT8WA,This DVD is great and Amazon's persistance with replacing a defective DVD is very much appreciated.,1239580800,,99,5.25
8327483,5,B001NMT8WA,"I watched this on ESPN in Dec. and couldn't wait til it came out on dvd.
Hearing the players that played in the game talking with the current players just adds a whole amazing element to the game.
One things I specifically love about it is they bring in a specialist who digitally analizes and re creates car accidents  to recreate the controversial play where Gifford made or didn't make the first down in the fourth quarter.
Just an awesome dvd",1236729600,2,446,4.506172839506172
8327484,5,B001NMT8WA,"A older friend was a big Colts fan, and growing up in Baltimore, had such fond memories of the game that transformed football and changed the image of the Colts. He'd moved to Florida years ago and was so disappointed that he was unable to see it when it aired recently. We ordered it for him from Amazon, and he has enjoyed watching it very much. The interviews with old and new Colts players added a new dimension to the game, and the explanation of some of the controversial calls was also quite enlightening. I doubt we'll ever come up with a gift for him to top this one.",1236297600,,576,4.293577981651376
