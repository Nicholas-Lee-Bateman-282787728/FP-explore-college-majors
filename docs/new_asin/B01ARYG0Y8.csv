Shaky camera work, muted color, SOUND/AUDIO is DEFECTIVE (can't make out what they are saying at times, either too LOW or a BUZZING sound and is extremely ANNOYING). Plays like this in ALL my players. Save your money and skip this one, bad, just bad.",1509235200,,310,4.553571428571429

8748140,5,B01ARYG0Y8,"I just watched this the other night, and I enjoyed it. It's very creatively shot and lit and it is generally well made. It has a solid plot featuring a variety of twists and creative plays on folklore. 10/10 would watch again.",1468108800,2,226,4.404761904761905
8748141,5,B01ARYG0Y8,"Nathan's (Michael Schantz) sister was viciously attacked and murdered by an unknown assailant. The conditions under which she was found were suspicious. He  and his bandmates Marcus (Bryan Manley Davis), Clive (Zach Gillette), and Dylan (Ria Burns-Wilder) are going to do whatever they have to in order to bring the killer to justice, their brand of justice. They have a pretty good idea who it is: Todd (Laurence Mullaney), a married business man that she had been having an affair with. All the evidence is pointing in his direction but the thing is, it wasn't your run of the mill murder. The way the body was torn apart would suggest it was done by an animal. This leads Marcus to believe Todd may be a werewolf.  Chained up to a chair, he's interrogated by the group who want to know the truth and prove to the world he's a wolf in sheep's clothing (metaphorically and physically).

I really had no clue what to expect when I put this film on the television. I was prepared to laugh at it, I was even prepared to be bored by it. Really, when you sit down to watch an ultra low budget horror film, 9 out of 10 times you're stuck with a turd. SHEEP SKIN was actually that very rare one time when you find yourself drawn into the film and characters. Writer/director Kurtis Spieler relies on his talent at developing characters and writing dialogue instead of scares and gore to deliver a highly entertaining and suspenseful thriller. The film takes place almost entirely in the same location, a warehouse, and the dialogue is real and witty. None of this would have worked had it not been for just how very good the acting is. Everyone is fantastic and believable, especially Michael Schantz and I hope to see him continue on from here. The film never grows dull and the final twenty minutes of the film really deliver. The suspense is kept high in regards to learning if Todd is really a werewolf or not. The film is a brisk 80min and is a very tense experience. This one might slip under the radar but we can't let that happen. SHEEP SKIN should be seen.",1466467200,2,2059,4.514745308310992

8748144,4,B01ARYG0Y8,"Because of circumstantial evidence Todd (Laurence Mullaney) is suspected of being a werewolf while his wife (Jamie Lyn Bagley) thinks he is just sleeping around. Four members of a punk band kidnap and cuff Todd in a warehouse where they question him and wait for him to change into a werewolf while their doubts increase. Also is a bad night for Mrs. Todd to figure out that GPS phone tracker thing.

We've done the warehouse films before, ""Reservoir Dogs""  being my favorite. Zach Gillette takes the role of a ""Michael Madsen"" type, who simply likes to beat people up. The low budget film ""Four"" was also a warehouse film, I thought was done well too on a budget.

The whole film involves interaction until the end when we discover the truth. The interactions and characters proved to be entertaining enough for the duration of the production.

Personally I was hoping for a twist with the wife actually being a werewolf who had followed her husband around. Not too late for an alternative ending.

Guide: F-word. No sex. Male butt nudity (Laurence Mullaney)

Note to self:  Matthew 7:15 should not be taken literally.",1465084800,,1119,4.796875
8748145,4,B01ARYG0Y8,"When it comes to watching an Unearthed Films the worst thing you can say is that it suffered from normalcy. This is a label that strives to push the boundaries in their films, the weirder or more excessive the better. Most critics do not get them, thus they will praise the bulls*** that Hollywood pushes and feel they are part of that flesh wagon of false. I have always had a soft spot in my darkness for their films. Sheep Skin is much more fun than it has any right to be. While it shies away from the gore and violence this label has been known to give us, it is also the most in depth story one of their films has told us in a while. While people will see the cover and assume this is a straightforward werewolf film, but this film actually plays out more of some kind of CBS crime thriller in a indie vein. This film has two big positives off the bat, the timing of the delivery and the acting of the characters. This film believes in its writing and it shows, this is the kind of film that you are just as curious as to what can happen next as the people in the film.

We meet Todd who is a businessman who seems to love to cheat on his wife. When he hits on a girl, things get odd. He is kidnapped by a group of people who want to know if Todd killed someone and they feel he is not human. This film really delivers quite the statement and the ending is so off the wall insane, you will sit there long after the dvd comes out of the player, and think about it still. The film is a slow burn at times, but the acting really keeps everything flowing and riveting. This film is not for everyone, I feel some horror fans are going to be expecting more horror than this film gives out. The patience of most film watchers these days is pretty sad. Thus, films like this will sadly go under the radar for the most part. This film though if you are willing and daring, this little gem is going to win you over. What a good film and maybe people may have different perceptions on what Unearthed Films is all about after viewing this. I would say this is well worth a watch.",1463529600,4,2073,4.093366093366093
