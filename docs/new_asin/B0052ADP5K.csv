8453664,2,B0052ADP5K,I really had my hopes up for this one---Hard to follow-thrown together mess. This was more like a rushed trailer.,1356220800,,113,4.7
8453665,4,B0052ADP5K,"If you're looking for Michael Bay's latest multi-million dollar effects extravaganza or that so slick it slides off your screen studio horror flick, this ain't that.
 The Giant Rubber Monster Movie is, it's own special way, better.
 If you're of a certain age (like me), you remember movies like this. Back in the day, those pre-internet days, when Godzilla and his merry band of misfits ruled that channel way at the end of your dial (and almost always on the `regular' channels on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon). Those were the days of weird screeching monsters from outer space and Japanese guys that spoke out of synch that occasionally could fly or shot laser beams out of their eyes.
 Laser beams out of their eyes! and you knew those monsters were nothing but guys in rubber suits and that background they `flew' behind looked awfully funny, and some part of you just didn't care. Those monsters did some serious city stomping and butt kicking and many a days on the playground were spent wrestling around with your friends (embarrassingly screeching yourself), proclaiming who would be `King'.
 This, is one of those kind of movies.
 Later, you'd see more movies like those ones you saw as a kid. There was USA Up All Night with Rhonda Shear (mmmm, Rhonda Shear...ahem, sorry, where was I?) and movies in the video stores with crazy titles that had jungles and aliens and - always best of the best - even more guys in giant rubber suits.
 I loved those movies. There were the kind of things that occasionally made you scratch your head and wonder who in the hell made this and you knew whoever did didn't have a lot of money and you just didn't care then either. If anything, it made them better. Those movies were fun and exciting, and above all, they had heart.
 The Giant Rubber Monster Movie is one those movies.
 It had me laughing, cheering and rooting for it and you can tell when you're watching it the people making it were having fun. A gore filled slaughter to wipe out the family of the monster's creator so he won't be born in the future that includes a grenade between somebody's boobs? Check. A giant monster who doesn't know the difference between sexual moves and fighting moves? Yep, we got that. A too cute for his own good kid who gets mixed up with a guy with ties to the government who just so happens to be a serial killer? Yeah, why the hell not.
 This movie has all these things and so much more. From those model tanks rolling across the landscape to director Thomas Berdinski going for broke as `Sascratch' (his PR alter ego) to do battle with the dreaded `Afrodesious', you'll be taken back to the days of big G and his terror on Tokyo and can't help but smile. The cast includes horror hosts Sigmund Zoid and Count Gregula (and speaking of too cute, horror host Roxy Tyler sets up the whole thing with her opening narrative and in my mind, about steals the show. Between her and Marlena Midnite and Robin Graves, if you like you some pretty girls, it`s got plenty of those, too).
 I bought this movie, along with 'Normegeddon - A Mark Anvil Thriller', because the director had posted about one of the actor's needing funds due to an illness. That my friends, like this movie, is all heart.
 Show this guy and your childhood some love and check it out. You be screeching with delight and stomping that old Lego city of yours in your mind for sure.",1342828800,,3384,4.540229885057471

This movie makes all sorts of promises and does not even hold up or keep 1 of them. I love B movies, bad movies, ridicules flicks but this is just bad and NOT in a good way. It would receive ZERO stars if permitted but Amazon does not allow such a gift! I was very excited to see this flick due to the ratings it had received but only to be let down in a SERIOUS way.

1. DVD-R format not a TRUE DVD (PURPLE DISC)
2. The Short runs 14 minutes & 36 seconds (not a motion picture but a short film)
3. The cost is $11.99 for a 14 min & 36 sec DVD-R (WAY TOO MUCH) $5.00 would be more like it!
4. DVD cover looks like a 3rd grader created it
5. It claims on the DVD cover, ""In the grand tradition of SPACE GIANTS, SPECTREMAN, JOHNNY SOKKO & SERIAL KILLER movies"" Don't be fooled, it's nothing like or has ANYTHING to do with the greats it has compared it self to. How dare they even compare or mention such classics to this piece of junk that was created!
6. FULL FRAME (need i say more)
7. The acting is just bad and not in a good way.
8. The other monster (Sascratch) is not in a rubber suit but a man in a T-Shirt and a puffy wig with a human face, yes HUMAN FACE. A BIG LET DOWN!!!!!!!!!
9. I did not laugh one time throughout this disaster of what they call a film.
10. Now i have a spare table coaster for my drinks & you will to if you buy this trash.

I highly can not recommend this garbage to anyone. I love monster movies and Japanese Kaiju films but this film is an INSULT to them and how dare they compare this mess to the greats!

8453667,5,B0052ADP5K,"From the Muskegon, Michigan Master Of Manic Monster Madness & Mayhem, Tom Berdinski, comes The Giant Rubber Monster Movie: Sascratch Versus Afrodesious. Berdinski gave us the great indie horror flick/miniseries The Italian Zombie Movie, Parts I & II. Now, Berdinski has turned his eye for old classics of the 70's & 80's towards the Toho monster movies, Ultraman, and other movies involving giant robots/monsters/creatures, including Godzilla, of course. Into this movie mix, Tom then throws some kung-fu, a little ""Dexter"", and every horror host that he knows from the convention circuit. What results is nothing short of hilarious. It's meant to be cheesy, and revels in it!! Definitely check it out!

8453668,5,B0052ADP5K,"I had the pleasure of getting a preview of this on Ormsby's Cinema Insane special (only up until June 17!) and I have to tell you that Tom Berdinski has created a delightful recreation of the schlocky old shows of my youth, with gonzo dialogue, a goofy story, and effects that are actually better than most first run Doctor Who and all of Space Giants.

Even the young hero of the story, Miko, is dressed to be the twin brother of Gam from Space Giants.  All it needed was someone transforming into a rocket ship, and I'd be in nostalgia heaven.

Plenty of guest appearances by internet film hosts pop up, and really, it is totally worth the $12 you'll pay for it.  I saw it for free, but I'm throwing my cash to Berdinski, who is making a sequel to this, and his other films - Italian Zombie Movie 1 and Italian Zombie Movie 2.

I can't wait to see who Sascratch fights next time!",1307404800,,881,4.283132530120482
