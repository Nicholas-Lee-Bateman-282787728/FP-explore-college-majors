369035,5,6301801253,"This is one of the top 5 Doctor Who adventures I have seen!  The mood it sets is fantastic, the acting is spot on, and the story is one of the best and most interesting of the entire series.  The plot of this story far  outweighs those of almost any mainstream sci-fi.  This is a video to show  someone to prove why Doctor Who is the best ever science fiction series  ever(hence it's part in the 'Gateway Collection').  Even the special  effects aren't bad, but we all know that great special effects are no  substitute for a good story (something they forgot about in ID4).

369091,4,6301801253,"Tom Baker is the first Doctor I ever saw, so naturally he is my favorite. Aside from my personal preference, he is also acknowledged as one of the best Doctors, embodying the comedic and dramatic elements of the character well. He's quick-witted, quirky, and captivating. His scarf is the most iconic element of the series aside from the TARDIS itself. Finding a DVD with a full adventure featuring Tom Baker in the library, I knew I had to get it.

The story starts in Egypt, where an archeologist breaks into a pyramid's burial chamber. He uncovers a wall on which an eye starts glowing. His Egyptian helpers leave in terror but the oh-so-smart British archeologist keeps going, where he gets blasted by some crazy light. Cut to the Doctor and Sarah Jane, who are coming back to Earth. They land at UNIT's headquarters, but they get there in 1911 before UNIT even exists. The priory is owned by, you guessed it, the archeologist, who is not there. But a wacky Egyptian servant is there and has legal papers that let him both store the tomb's finds and hide them from any visitors. The servant clearly believes in the Egyptian gods and that one of them, Sutekh the Destroyer, is about to rise again. Sutekh is actually one of the Osirians, an alien race with god-like powers. He was imprisoned in a pyramid on Earth because he was destroying every planet he came to. Naturally the Doctor does not want Sutekh released and does his best to stop Sutekh's servants.

This set of four episodes was originally broadcast in 1975 but it holds up surprisingly well. The performances and writing are top-notch, creating an exciting story. The monster henchmen (robot mummies) are effectively odd and menacing. The effects aren't super-wobbly like in other early Doctor Who shows, though some of them are very simple (the TARDIS flying in space and another object ""floating"" in the air are very obviously wire work).

Highly recommended if you want to dip your toes into earlier Doctor Who shows.",1433289600,,1987,4.770348837209302

The Doctor and Sarah must battle android mummies and posessed minions in order to stop Sutek from returning to full power and taking over the universe.
This episode was mabe the fifth or sixth I got to see and as such I really have fond memories of it. It still remains in my top ten must-see episodes for fans of both the old and new Doctor Who. If you are a younger fan and have also been watching ""The Sarah-Jane Adventures"", this is also a must. At the beginning of one episode (the title escapes me at the moment) Sarah-Jane uses K-9 and Mr. Smith to jam signals from a Mars rover to keep NASA from finding the pyramid. This episode also mentions the Ice Warriors, but that's another review.
Overall, this is a thrilling and creepy story. There are mummies and people do die in this episode so it might be too frightening for the very young (under 8). In fact, this was one of the episodes which inspired thousands of letters from parents complaining about how scary the show was. But also consider that the children themselves wrote thousands more letters declaring that the scary monsters was exactly why they watched Doctor Who. Thus was born the traditional comment that children love to watch the show from behind the couch. Just remember: you know your child best and if he or she is watching the new series and enjoying it, then the classic series should  not  pose any problems.
The other thing to remember is that this is a classic episode from a time when the show had a shoestring budget and no access to CGI or animatronics. What helps the story immensely is that it was filmed on location on a beautiful estate which was also used for the exteriors of ""The Seeds of Death""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Seeds-Of-Death-Story-48-Special-Edition/dp/B005SJGI7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Seeds Of Death (Story 48) - Special Edition</a>.

369263,5,6301801253,"Ever since I saw Face of Evil, I've been collecting whatever Tom Baker Doctor Who DVDs I see at the right price (in fact, ANY Doctor Who DVDs I see at the right price).  At less than $8 with shipping & handling, I wasn't going to find a better deal anytime soon, so I ordered this one.  Recently, I read an issue of SciFi Now (74, to be precise) that had an article on the Fourth Doctor, including the top 10 DVDs to buy.  This was #3.  And I can certainly understand why.

I must say that Tom Baker will always be my favorite Doctor.  I've come to love Matt Smith & the rest of the first 6 Doctors (except for the second), & I'm sure I'll love David Tennant, but really when I think about Doctor Who, I can't help but think about him.  And like they say, you never forget your first Doctor.  He really shines here, showing a range of emotions and his trademark cleverness.  He needed it, since he had to face one of the greatest foes he's ever dealt with: Sutekh.  For a guy who almost never moved, he was pretty imposing.  I've rarely felt this much sense of dread during a Classic Who serial.  I was on the edge of my seat during the last episode.  All the other actors were great as well.  I'm very glad I got it, & at a great price too.  This is one fan favorite story that's not overrated (unlike, say, The Talons of Weng-Chiang).

369266,5,6301801253,"When watching Doctor Who's ""Classic"" series episodes, one must usually adjust one's expectations for pacing, special effects, and a bit of campiness from a different era of television. However, I think ""Pyramids of Mars"" could air proudly alongside ""Blink"" or ""Human Nature"" with little alteration. Every performer is at the top of their game, especially Gabriel Woolf's sinisterly serene vocal performance as Sutekh the Destroyer, the peerless Elisabeth Sladen as our beloved Sarah Jane Smith, and Tom Baker in the Doctor's always-captivating Fourth incarnation. The story is nicely spooky and dark, while maintaining that Who sense of humor and a pace that never has you checking to see how much of the story is left. For every special effect that is hokey or dated, there is another that is incredibly cool and creepy, as in the unforgettable cliffhanger at the end of Part One. The special features are perhaps a bit lacking in number for a story of its stature, but what extras there are are of the usual high quality of the franchise, including a comedy piece one might expect to be cringe-worthy, but is really quite funny. I know there is virtually nothing to say about ""Pyramids of Mars"" that hasn't already been said, and much more eloquently, I'm sure, but I can't recommend this one highly enough; it's sure to be one of my all-time favorites, no matter how many more stories come along to eclipse it.",1329609600,,1413,4.891666666666667

369268,5,6301801253,"If I had to save just one handful of my DVDs from a house fire, I'm pretty confident that ""The Pyramids of Mars"" would be found in my sweaty grip. This is one damn fine DR. WHO story - one of the best of the Tom Baker stories and one of the finest of the Phillip Hinchliffe ""horror"" era.

""Pyramids"" opens with Professor Marcus Scarman (Bernard Archard) blundering into an ancient Egyptian tomb and discovering something nasty and very much alive inside of it. Cut to the Doctor (Tom Baker) and Sarah Jane Smith (Liz Sladen) materializing at UNIT headquarters, a mansion in the London suburbs. Unfortunately the Doctor has...as usual...screwed up his timing, and appeared about eighty years early; instead of the 1980s mansion occupied by the Brigadier, he's appeared during the Edwardian Era, when it was owned by the Scarman family. The place is full of Egyptian relics, but instead of a Scarman running the household, it's under the care of a creepy, obnoxious Egyptian named Namin (Peter Mayock). Before you can say, ""What the hell is in those sarcophagi?"" the family butler has been found strangled, and family friend Dr. Warlock (Peter Copley) has been shot. Then Marcus Scarman appears, apparently under the influence of someone/something he calls ""Sutekh the Destoyer"", and the real mayhem begins. Suffice to say that Sutekh, who has the powers of a god and the mind-set of a homicidal maniac, is not someone you want roaming free about the universe. But can the Doctor prevent him from escaping his ancient prison?

I could go much more deeply into the plot, but I don't want to give too much away here, except to say that in Sutekh, played by Gabriel Woolf, we have one of the best Dr. Who villains of all time...and that is saying something. His coldly arrogant, whsipery, psychopathic-sounding voice is both mesmerizing and terrifying, and his dialogue, written by Lewis Griefer and Robert Holmes, is nothing short of brilliant: ""It is within my power to choose the manner of your death. I could keep you alive for centuries, wracked by the most excruciating pain. Since you have condemned me to spend eternity in the Eye of Horus, it would make an amusing diversion...""

What's more, the set-design and costumes in this story are truly reminiscent of old-school monster movies, and do a great deal to establish a brooding, doom-filled atmosphere, as do the performances of Archard and Michael Sheard (who plays Laurence Scarman). It is true that this is one of the most brutally violent of all DR. WHO episodes, and that the Doctor often acts heartlessly, but as he points out to Sarah, what are a few grisly murders compared to genocide?

In sum, this tale has all the best features of a good DR. WHO episode: it's ingenious, fast-paced, highly inventive, and delivers horror and humor in (almost) equal measure. I highly advise a trip to see the Pyramids. Just beware Sutekh.",1319068800,,2890,4.832323232323232
369269,5,6301801253,"""Pyramids of Mars"" consistently ranks high among fans' favorite Doctor Who stories of all time, and for several good reasons: Tom Baker, then in his second season, was hitting his stride as the Fourth Doctor, accompanied by fan favorite Elisabeth Sladen as companion Sarah Jane Smith; producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes (who substantially wrote ""Pyramids"" but is not credited) were taking the show in the direction of gothic horror, which would lead to some the most stylish, best-remembered stories in the series' history.

""Pyramids"" was essentially a tribute to the Hammer horror films of the 1960s--in this case, the mummy pictures starring Christopher Lee. Designer Christine Ruscoe and costumer Barbara Kidd stepped up to the challenge handsomely with Victorian-era sets inspired by the story's exterior setting, Stargrove Manor, then owned by Mick Jagger, as well as ancient Egyptian-style props and costumes that complement the action.

Tom Baker makes perhaps the most striking entrance in the show's history, standing silently next to the TARDIS's control panel, head bowed, hands in pockets like a Western gunfighter before looking up to later utter the immortal lines: ""The Earth isn't my home, Sarah. I'm a Time Lord...I'm not a human being. I walk in eternity."" It gives us a hint of the melancholy and simmering rage that will follow because, for all its fun and games, ""Pyramids"" reveals an intensity we have not seen before in the Fourth Doctor; in some scenes, he almost hisses his lines at Sarah and the other characters, as if they cannot comprehend the seriousness of the menace they're facing.

Sutekh, an Egyptian god imprisoned deep within a pyramid on the planet Mars, threatens all life on Earth--and perhaps throughout the universe--with total devastation. The casting for this story is note-perfect, with Gabriel Woolf as Sutekh, a role that required an exceptional voice actor, because Sutekh wears a cumbersome mask throughout and sits motionless for 99 percent of his time on screen, paralyzed on his Martian throne. Bernard Archard is Marcus Scarman, the cadaverous Egyptologist possessed by Sutekh to do his bidding. In one particularly demanding scene, he is shot in the back and then re-absorbs the force of the bullet, an effect that required him to perform the entire scene in reverse.

The Special Features menu includes the customary making-of documentary, which features an interview with director Paddy Russell, one of the few women to direct Doctor Who, and a tough old bird she must have been, if interviews with the actors are to be believed. ""Pyramids"" was her favorite of the four Doctor Who stories she directed, a sentiment she attributed to the strong script. And don't miss ""Serial Thrillers,"" a mini-documentary that surveys how Hinchcliffe and Holmes used gothic horror to explore science fiction themes.",1312502400,,2881,5.229437229437229

Nickelodeon and/or PBS used to re-run the episodes in the late 70s and early 80s.  I grew up with this show back then.  The special effects, sets and story lines were over the top and yet at the same time, classic in every respect.  This was a time when TV and more specifically had actors that could act!  These shows had plots, character development and just plain old imagination for great sci-fi concepts.  Dr. Who is a British sc-fi classic!  I will always love this series.  Buy this episode.  It was great!",1297468800,,621,4.368421052631579
369372,5,6301801253,"As a young boy, I vividly remember some of the shows I used to watch late on a Saturday night.  Saturday nights were the one night during the week that I was able to stay up late.  Sometimes I would watch WWF wrestling with my dad and other times we would watch the Three Stooges on the local tv station.  My dad never cared for sci-fi.  He grew up with Westerns and my siblings and I all grew up with a very deep appreciation of that genre.  For Dad, sci-fi was the opposite of the Western.  He didn't like them.  However, he knew that I did and every once in awhile he would stay up with me on a Saturday night and we would watch DOCTOR WHO on PBS.  I didn't know it until recently, but the Doctor who I saw those few times as a kid was Tom Baker. It was the early 1980s and our local affiliate had just started showing DOCTOR WHO episodes.  Of those few DOCTOR WHO episodes that I saw with my Dad, DOCTOR WHO PYRAMIDS OF MARS is the only one I remember seeing.

The opening episode of that story gave me nightmares for weeks.  The Doctor and Sarah Jane are planning on returning to Earth when the TARDIS is thrown of course and a giant floating head of a jackal projects itself into the machine.  The Doctor and Sarah arrive on Earth, but are unsure as to what exact time they are.  It turns out to be 1911 at an old priory owned by an archaeologist named Marcus Scarman.  Marcus has been to Egypt and while there he uncovered a tomb that really wasn't a tomb, but a prison for the last and most evil of the Osirans, Sutekh.  This jackal-headed entity has been waiting for thousands of years for release.  Sutekh considers all life, besides his own, his enemy. The fate of the universe is at stake as the Doctor attempts to outwit Sutekh and prevent him from escaping.

Like many of the episodes in the era of DOCTOR WHO under the production of Peter Hinchcliffe, the writing in ""Pyramids of Mars"" is exceptional.  Stephen Harris received the writing credit, but it's known that Robert Holmes wrote most everything that appeared on screen.

The acting in the episode is also superb and there are some real fine performances here.  Over twenty-five-years later, ""Pyramids of Mars"" is the only DOCTOR WHO story from my childhood that I remember watching. After recently watching this DVD, I still got shudders when the disembodied head of Sutekh suddenly appears on TARDIS.  When a television episode still has an effect like that over two decades after first seeing it, you know it must be good.

This DVD is loaded with extra features.  There's a commentary with Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah), Micahel Sheard, and Philip Hinchcliffe and occasional comments from director Paddy Russell.  There are several deleted/extended scenes.  There's a documentary entitled ""Osiran Gothic"" about the unusual set design of this story which combined elements of Egyptian architecture with Victorian Gothic.  There's another short featurette entitled ""Now and Then"" which shows what Stargrove manor looked like when DOCTOR WHO filmed there and what it looks like now (through this I learned that Stargrove was once owned by Mick Jagger).

Also included is a fairly long featurette entitled ""Serial Thrillers"" which focuses on the DOCTOR WHO stories of Philip Hinchcliffe's era.  There's a short comedic featurette featuring Sutekh talking about his post-""Pyramids of Mars"" acting career.  There are some production notes, a photo gallery, and an easter egg of audio trailers and promos.",1286668800,,3469,4.706467661691542

369376,5,6301801253,"The title of this entry is somewhat deceiving because ninety percent of the action transpires on a picturesque English estate and, inside the appurtenant Manor House. Just a little footage is shot in a replicated Egyptian tomb and the remainder in a very coolly fabricated Martian cave, the latter being near the end (was I being redundant there???). In any event, there IS plenty of action (a frequent failing of Doctor Who episodes).

Basically, the story is that Sutekh (Satan to us) has been entombed by the Egyptian God Horace for thousands of years but the intervention of an English archaeologist led to The Evil One's chance to escape captivity. So, Sutekh takes over the archaeologist's body and travels back to his huge estate to set up camp where he needs to transport his ""being"" to Mars to destroy the Eye of Horace which holds him in captivity.

Just as Sutekh gets rolling on this endeavor, Doctor Who and his sidekick, Sarah, swoop in with the TARDIS and the two proceed to complicate matters for old Sutekh, who is neither amused nor the first bit pleased with the Time Lord's interference with his plans. And don't let the hefty ""mummies"" fool you when you first see them -- they're actually evil, but groovy, robots, the sinister minions of Sutekh the Terrible.

This entry is well-done with plenty of great cinematography and is supported by a solid and coherent story. Elisabeth Sladen stars as Sarah and the great Tom Baker as Doctor Who. This BBC production is 97 minutes in length, with an aspect ratio of 4:3, and is listed as ""Story No. 82,"" airing originally from 10/25/75 through 11/15/75.

369378,5,6301801253,"Many consider Pyramids of Mars to be all that is good about classic Doctor Who. And many would be very accurate in their evaluation!  Pyramids certainly deserves to be ranked at or near the top of the entire Doctor Who run, let alone the Tom Baker era.  It features perhaps the most evil villain ever to wreak havoc across the Universe, Sutekh, a representation of a Satan figure.  Sutekh is the greatest vocal villain in the history of the program.  For a villain who simply sits in a chair, unable to move through most of the program, he ably gets around using his calm but menacing, condescending vocal qualities, as well as a cadavor called ""the body formerly known as professor Marcus Scarman"".  The first exposure to Sutekh voice, the cliffhanger to episode one as he chillingly states that he brings the gift of death to all humanity, brings a tingle down one's spine.

Pyramids is also the story in which the Doctor finally sets aside the UNIT era, telling Sarah that he doesn't consider Earth his home and that he has to find something better to do than to go chasing around after the Brigadier.  This qualifies as a vast departure from the Third Doctor, who called Earth his home away from home, and, apart from his first season, willingly acted as UNIT's scientific advisor. For better or for worse, depending on perspective, the Doctor becomes a free agent again at this point.

More subtly, the writers touch upon a controversial topic, capital punishment.  When Sarah asks the Doctor if Sutekh was so evil why didn't Horus and the rest of the Osirans simply kill him, the Doctor responds that it was against their code of honor.  Killing him would mean they are no better than he was.  Again this is a matter perspective, but in this case one perspective is incurably flawed.  You can wrongly believe that since the Osirans were an honorable race, killing Sutekh indeed would make them no better that he was, flawed logic considering that Sutekh left a trail of death and destruction across the Universe, and executing him would ensure the survival of millions of souls across the Universe. They would simply be getting rid of a vicious killer.  Or you can correctly believe that the Doctor condemned the Osirans for simply imprisoning Sutekh because this left open the possibility of escape to terrorize the Universe once more. In the end, the Doctor corrected the Osiran's mistake, ""executing"" Sutekh by sending him through the time tunnel far in the future so he aged to death.

All that said, you just gotta love a story in which the villain in episode one is an Egyptian named Ibrahim Namin, portrayed so eloquently by an Englishman named Peter Mayock.  I can't see anyone getting away with that in today's politically correct society.  Good thing we have stories like Pyramids of Mars to serve as reminders of a once not-so-sensitive world.",1196812800,7,2860,4.7591093117408905

369380,4,6301801253,"It's no secret that Tom Baker portrayed probably the most loved incarnation of ""Doctor Who.""  Sarah Jane Smith was one of his best companions.  ""Pyramids of Mars"" is one of the best serials to feature them together.  No, there aren't any Daleks or Cybermen roaming around, but there is one nasty villain who goes by the name of Sutekh.  He's an Egyptian ""god"" who had a run-in with another Egyptian god, Horus.  He's trapped in the Eye of Horus for all eternity....or at least that's what we're told.  In this serial, he attempts to break free of his confines via an English archaeologist by using him to collect the things necessary for his escape.  Of course, the good Doctor and Sarah Jane intervene, hoping to prevent a terrible future for planet Earth.  With android mummies and poachers running around, can the Doctor stop Sutekh?

This serial has one of the best storylines of all of the Tom Baker episodes.  There's also some excellent witty banter between not only Baker and Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah Jane), but between other cast members as well.

The DVD transition looks excellent.  The disc contains plenty of extras including a running commentary, Who's Who actor info, an easter egg, an ""interview"" with a disappointed Sutekh, and many other things.

If you enjoy your ""Doctor Who"" with a little bit of action, a little bit of comedy and a touch of suspense, ""Pyramids of Mars"" is right up your timeline.",1186531200,3,1417,4.7818930041152266

369449,5,6301801253,"Sometimes ""Doctor Who"" succeeds as a show by taking itself very seriously, as with the classic ""Genesis of the Daleks."" And then sometimes it makes itself dear to our hearts just by presenting us with a good, fun, straightforward science-fiction adventure. Intelligently written, well-acted, finely crafted, and clever in ways no other TV series can be, of course, but blissfully free of moral dilemmas and explorations into humanity's heart of darkness. As you may have guessed, ""Pyramids of Mars"" is a particularly fine example of ""Doctor Who"" in this latter mode. It's a thrilling, suspenseful tale of good vs. evil--Here we have Sutekh, an extraordinarily powerful extraterrestrial, imprisoned within the Martian Pyramids ages ago by his fellow beings because of his unhealthy impulse to blot out all life but his own; now, in 1911, he has a chance to break free again because of a British archaeologist's blunder, and it's up to the Doctor and Sarah to outwit him and save the cosmos from a premature entropy. It's as simple as that, folks.

Simple, but not simplistic. As usual, this show demonstrates its alchemical knack for turning lead into gold, for taking standard plotlines and hackneyed themes and bringing them marvelously to life, making them interesting and clever (""regenerating"" them, if you will). Nowhere is this more evident than in the overall motif of this storyline, for what could be more tired and cliche than an old ""Curse of the Mummy"" type horror film? And yet it really works, intriguingly translated into a science fiction idiom--the mummies are robots, the Egyptian god is a powerful extraterrestrial, demonic possession is some sort of telepathic mind control, magic powers are telekinesis, burial urns are force field generators, the secret passwords and magic spells to get into the heart of the pyramid are mathematical puzzles and logical riddles, and so on and so forth. Granted, some of this is delightfully inspired technobabble rather than hard science per se, but it still relocates the story out of the realm of the supernatural (which most of us don't take seriously anymore) into a natural, secular one we tend to find plausible if only speculatively so. And yet the writers get playful with this relocation a little bit, too, slyly hinting at a certain experiential wisdom in the old fears: at the very beginning, the modern, rational British archaeologist rushes in to his doom while his Egyptian diggers run away in a panic like ""superstitious savages"" (as he snaps at their fleeing backs, famous last words)--at the end of the day, they're the ones who'll go home to dinner, which sure beats becoming a telepathically animated corpse, generally speaking.

The Doctor's character also shows a lot of complexity in this story, and after getting overly cozy with him over the years we are pointedly reminded that he is not an Earthling and doesn't necessarily share our priorities, nor our natural reactions and attitudes. Tom Baker always gets credit for his delightfully wacky, oddball rendition of the Doctor, and rightfully so. It's indeed one of the joys of the program. But one shouldn't let that obscure his ability to get across a wide range of other emotions with great subtlety, from a cantankerous temper and dash of arrogance almost worthy of Hartnell's Doctor to pained humiliation as he's forced to kneel before the villain, from very real anger and fury at well-intentioned but misguided actions putting them all in danger to a strong and solid sense of moral backbone. And he excels at making the Doctor alien without alienating us.

Anyway, I had always assumed that the title of this storyline referred to the pyramid-like formations found on the Martian landscape around the Cydonia region, about which there's been so much speculation over the years. What a neat touch, I thought. When I double-checked, though, I found that these objects were not photographed by Viking I until July of 1976, about half a year after ""Pyramids of Mars"" originally aired in November, 1975.

That is, the transfer is very clear and the DVD is chock full of extras.  Not to get too much into the story, as you who are reading this are probably already an avid Doctor Who fan like myself, but the main gist is that the Doctor has to go against one of his most powerful enemies, Sutekh-this guy makes the Master seem like the Good Humor man.  A special note of consideration:  the importance of Gabriel Woolf's vocal portrayal of Sutekh's cold evilness cannot be overstated.  I don't think this episode would have come off half as scary without Woolf's participation.  As for the extras, bon' appetit!  The best of the little spoof about Sutekh and his career post-Pyramids of Mars.  There are two very informative interviews/documentaries.  The first is specifically about the episode of the Pyramids and how it came to be.  The second is an overview of the Hinchcliffe/Baker era of Doctor Who, often considered by many fans to be the golden era of Doctor Who.  Other extras include a compare/contrast feature of the Stargrove location (then owned by Rolling Stone Mick Jagger) where parts of the episode were filmed.  The easter egg is of some BBC announcements of the Pyramids episode and the Alien Invasion episode that followed.  The other feature that is very worth a while to check out is the production note option.  This is an informative, and relatively non-obtrusive, behind-the-scenes factoid of the production of the Pyramids of Mars episode.",1119657600,8,1567,4.798507462686567
369467,5,6301801253,"The Pyramids Of Mars is my third favourite Doctor who story.  It features one of the most powerful villans ever in Doctor Who, no less than the Egyptian god Sutekh (Set). Fortunately he is trapped in ancient pyramid after his god brothers (Horus, Osiris and others), stopped him from destroying the Universe.  But thousands of years later, a British archaeologist stumbles into the wrong tomb and is taken over by Sutekh who's mind is free but his body is  totally imobilized. The Doctor and Sarah land in the wrong time zone and become embroiled in the situation.  At one stage Sarah raises a point that has significance for all Doctor Who.  What if they leave in the TARDIS and go back to the present (or say, five years in the future, for those who think 1980 is a canonistic glitch), won't the Universe be ok?  After all, they just came from there and everything was fine (aside from rampent zygons and the Loch Ness Monster, but that's another story...).  The Doctor does just that and they find Earth an empty wasteland, just a ball of space dust.  Why is that?  If the TARDIS hadn't landed where she had the Doctor would have never fought Sutekh and the Earth would not have been destroyed in 1980.  But the fact is, the TARDIS had, and so everything was set in motion.  Time was waiting for the Doctor to arrive, and when he did switches were activated and the time track was changed.  But what if the Doctor had died in the previous adventure.  Who would have stopped Sutekh?  Would the Universe be wiped out.  Perhaps it would.  Or maybe Time would have found someone else to fix the problem.  If some belive in Gaia, a living, perhaps sentient Earth who will fight back if her survival is threatened, perhaps our Universe is a kind of Mega Gaia who can manipulate Time and Space to guarantee her survival.

  All this is very deep, but I think relevant to this particular story.  Doctor Who is not mindless entertainment for the kiddies.  But for those who like entertainment with their philosophy:

  Watch robot mummies crush a poacher, watch Sutekh and his Gift Of Death, see the Doctor bow down to a mighty Egyptian god, and gasp at the Eye Of Horus within the Pyramids of Mars.",1114646400,4,2193,4.547314578005115

Another great ""Doctor Who"" serial that is arguably one his best adventures.

The TARDIS, with The Doctor & Sarah onboard, is making its way back to UNIT HQ when it experiences a reverse time anomaly. The Doctor safely lands The TARDIS & discovers that, they are at the correct location, but, decades earlier in an old priory that is now standing where UNIT HQ will become sometime in the future.

The Doctor senses there is extreme danger within the spacetime continium & starts to investigate as to whats is going on. The priory is owned by archeologist, Marcus Scarman, who has discovered, on his excavation in Egypt, the imprisoned tomb of Sutekh, The Destroyer. Sutekh an evil god of the Osirions killed his brother Horus & in turn The Osirions eternaly imprisoned Sutekh into a blind pyramid. That is until Scarman discovers his tomb & pays for his discovery with his life, as Sutekh kills Scarman, possessing his corpse & bringing back all items that were enclosed in his tomb back to the priory in England.

Sutekh's plan is to order Scarman to construct a rocket consisting of 4 nuclear warheads that can be sent to Mars & can free him from his eternal prison. Once freed, Sutekh will be able to destroy whole galaxies laying waste to billions of lives. Our evil is his good.

With the help of Sutekh's robot mummies, Scarman cardens off the grounds surrounding the priory stating that any humans within the property must die. The construction of the rocket begins, as The Doctor tries to come up with a plan. Along the way, The Doctor & Sarah meet Scarman's brother Lawrence, who still believes his brother is still alive & Dr. Warlock a friend of Marcus' who meets his untimely death at the hands of the robot mummies.

The Doctor, Sarah, & Lawrence return to the safety of The TARDIS to think of a way to stop Sutekh. Sarah wishes to go home to her own time & The Doctor obliges by bringing her back to 1980. The Doctor gives Sarah a crash course in ""anti-time"", in which the events of the present altercate the actions of the future. The Doctor opens the door to the TARDIS as Sarah stands in the doorway shocked to see her future change to nothing but ash & ruin. Essentialy, a dead planet orbiting its sun, courtesy of Sutekh.

Now with no choice but to go back & stop the evil Osirion, Sarah & The Doctor discover that if they destroy the rocket, Sutekh will still remain imprisoned forever in the pyramids of Mars. But, Sutekh has other plans & The Doctor must travel to Mars and stop Sutekh once & for all.

""The Pyramids Of Mars"" borrows heavily from The Hammer Films adaption of ""The Mummy"".

The mummies used for the show were quickly turned into robots as the director discovered while researching Egyptology that mummies were wrapped with there legs together, not apart.

The priory was indeed owned by Mick Jagger, of ""The Rolling Stones"", but, was not in attendance for the shooting of the show (he was rehearsing with ""The Stones"" for an upcoming world tour). Jagger's parents were there, instead.

Michael Sheard, who plays Lawrence Scarman, went on to do more ""Who"" episodes, but, will be eternally remembered as an autograph signing Hitler in ""Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade"" & also as the doomed Admiral Ozzel in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (Darth Vader, Force chokes him in the first quarter of the film. ""He is as clumsy as he is stupid."")

The DVD specs consists of all four parts to ""The Pyramids Of Mars"" in Dolby 2.0, with an optional audio commentary by the director and Elisabeth Sladen, Deleted Scenes, a look back at the priory used in the film, a look at Egyptology, & an Easter Egg consisting of the BBC 1 & 2 promos to each episode.",1110931200,3,4027,4.621848739495798

Even though I'm an American, I've seen most of the Dr. Who episodes, which are available (most of Hartnell's and Troughton's runs weren't preserved?).  From that perspective, I really think Tom Baker was the best Doctor; and his first 3 seasons (of which Pyramids of Mars is part of) represent the show at it's absolute peak.

369472,5,6301801253,"Dragged from the BBC archives comes another pair of classic Doctor Who releases on DVD from two different eras of the show. ""Pyramids of Mars"" and ""Earthshock"" are only six years apart in broadcast terms, but seem much more distant when viewed back to back. They're cracking tales nonetheless.

""Pyramids of Mars,"" the earlier story, broadcast in March 1976, stars Tom Baker in the role of the fourth Doctor alongside his travelling companion Sarah-Jane Smith, played by Elisabeth Sladen. Arguably one of the most successful pairing's of actors in the long running show's history, the chemistry between the two leads is at its peak, helped along largely by the incredible production skills of Philip Hinchcliffe and the scripting of Robert Holmes. This story takes them back to Earth, but this time into the near distant past of Edwardian England for a period piece exploring Egyptian mythology with sci-fi overtones. It's not only a cracking yarn and splendidly acted by a very, very strong cast, but designed and plotted to the hilt. It also presents one of the most chilling opponents the Time Lord has ever faced, Sutekh, played wonderfully by Gabriel Woolf. There is very little to criticize here, although detractors will try, unlike the companion release ""Earthshock.""

Produced in1981 for Peter Davison's first season as the fifth Doctor, ""Earthshock"" had a huge impact on the viewing public at the time of it's broadcast due to the reappearance after a seven year absence of the Doctor's second most popular enemy: The Cybermen. Kept a secret from everyone outside of the production, with red herring's set aplenty by the producer John Nathan-Turner to make sure it remained so, their sudden appearance at the end of episode one was a true classic moment of great TV. It comes at the end of a very atmospheric and chilling first episode, but alas, the pace isn't maintained in the remaining three. Written by the show's script editor, Eric Saward, it is very indicative of his style and that of the production team as a whole that guest stars, special effects and lavish sets were promoted to the detriment of plot and scripting. The plot to this story has so many holes and inconsistencies it all unravels into something of a mess. But having said that, it still works and if you don't pay too close attention, it's very enjoyable romp. Marking the first long time companion of the Doctor to meet a grisly end, the story finishes on a muted note that had a profound impact on the show and indeed the ratings; more so even than the Cybermen's return to TV screens.

As always, it's the extras on the discs that make the entrance price worth every penny. The BBC always does a tremendous job with the picture quality, commentary tracks, the subtitles and production notes and all sorts of bonus material. The bonuses here include two absolute gems that had me in fits of laughter. ""Pyramids of Mars"" contains a mock documentary about the villain Sutekh's life after the story and ""Earthshock"" has an additional ""episode 5."" Terrific stuff. The commentaries are also wonderful. Elisabeth Sladen and Philip Hinchcliffe are joined by recurring guest actor Michael Sheard with occasional comments from director Paddy Russell for a truly interesting commentary on ""Pyramids."" The commentary for ""Earthshock"" is even more fun with the full regular cast (Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, Matthew Waterhouse and Sarah Sutton) having a wonderful time coming together once more. Their on screen relationships were never very close or harmonious so it's great to hear that the four actors really were a very close team of pals.

Two terrific releases, despite weaknesses in the later story, which would be entertaining to non Doctor Who fans as well as the more seasoned viewer. Highly recommended.",1095033600,9,3793,4.98736176935229

369474,5,6301801253,"This was a great Doctor Who story from a great era. I have the region 2 DVD,and I have watched it alot. I thought the scariest story from The Tom Baker years was The Seeds of Doom,when I first watched that story way back when I was 7,I was afaid to turn the lights out for bed that night. It's not so scary now being a adult but it still makes you wonder ""What if that Plant next to my bed wants to kill me while I sleep?"" Right now a new Doctor Who series is in the works over in the UK,with Christopher Eccleston of 28 Days Later playing the Doctor,and there goal for the new series is to be scary,they want children to go running behind the soffas again. Cant wait to see it! What channel will it be on in the US?Cant see it being on PBS.The PBS station in Boston stopped showing Doctor Who years ago. It's to bad the Daleks will not be in the new show,well that could change. Well any way,way to go for the BBC to get all the old Doctor Who's out on VHS,and now the DVD's. Now how about Robot and Genesis of the Daleks on DVD?",1090800000,,1030,3.9806763285024154
369475,5,6301801253,"This continues the good stories that are well known in the early Baker years. His companionship with Sarah, one of the best Doctor/Companion pair ups of the entire series. The location and set designs, music and villians are all well done. Sutek makes a chilling villian, and the characters are all well acted. Classic scenes are infact the Tardis' voyage to  1980 earth to show Sarah what would become if Sutek were allowed to go free. Also the Mars pyramids and its many puzzles I found to be intriguing. The only flaw I found in this story is the organ playing in the beginning. Someone should delete this on the DVD release. We all know that is why Sutek sent his servant to kill the egyption in the first place. This is a classic Doctor Who story.",1087516800,,752,4.489051094890511
369476,4,6301801253,"Some stories done during Dr. Who producer Phillip Hinchcliff's time has been known as the Gothic era of the show.  He commissioned stories based on old horror and sci-fi.  Pyramids of Mars is a tribute to Hammer Films' mummy movies, using a lot of Egyptology themes and names.
After being mysteriously drawn off course to 1911 in an old priory where UNIT HQ would be built, the Doctor and Sarah become involved in the attempted return of Sutekh, an Osirian who was imprisoned by his brother Horus in a tomb recently uncovered by archaeologist Marcus Scarman.  He returns to the priory, a zombified puppet of Sutekh, who with help of service robots disguised as mummies, create a deflection barrier around the priory and set about constructing a rocket to destroy the pyramids of Mars to free Sutekh.
The Doctor and Sarah rescue Dr. Warlock, a friend of Marcus's who has been shot by an Egyptian, and enlist the aid of Laurence, Marcus's brother.  Laurence is an affable fellow, but despite seeing the possessed Marcus, still thinks of Marcus as his brother and not a puppet of Sutekh.  Laurence is played by Michael Sheard, a multiple Who alumni and Admiral Ozzel in The Empire Strikes Back.  Bernard Archard (Marcus) is effectively terrifying, his evil-looking eyes, curved down lips, and paled face put to good use.
How evil and how much Sutekh hates life is demonstrated in these lines:  ""The humans, animals, birds, fish, reptiles.  All life is my enemy.  All life shall perish under the reign of Sutekh the Destroyer.""  ""Your evil is my good. ... Where I tread, I leave nothing but dust and darkness.  I find that good!""  Gabriel Woolf's sepulchral voice is put to good use here as Sutekh.
Lots of Egyptology comes in, such as Horus's defeat of Sutekh with the help of 740 Osirians.  Not so coincidentally, 740 gods were listed on the tomb of Thutmosis III.  The answer to that is the wars of the gods (Osirians) entered into Egyptian mythology and the whole of Egyptian culture founded upon the Osirian pattern.  The various sarcophagi and artifacts boost the story's theme.
An interesting discussion takes place between Laurence Scarman, Marcus's brother, and the Doctor.  He takes Sarah and Laurence to a future Earth, a desolate planet circling a dead sun, which is how Sutekh would leave it.  ""Every point in time has its alternative.  You've looked into alternative time. ...The actions of the present fashion the future.""  When Laurence asks him if a man can change the course of history, the Doctor says ""To a small extent.  It takes a being of Sutekh's limitless power to destroy the future.""  The Doctor is thus a prisoner of moral obligation--until he stops Sutekh, he just can't up and leave.
Funny lines from Tom Baker:  ""deactivating a generator loop without a correct key is like repairing a watch with a hammer and chisel.  One false move and you'll never know the time again.""  And he panics at Sarah throwing him a box of gelignite, saying, ""Sweaty gelignite is highly unstable.  One good sneeze could set it off.""  When he asks the chastised Sarah for detonators or fuses, she can't find any, and mischievously says, ""Maybe he sneezed,"" meaning the owner of the gelignite.  We also learn here that he is 750 years old.
A blaring booboo comes when Sarah claims she comes from 1980.  UNIT stories generally take place the year the story is filmed.  Also, as the Brigadier retired in 1976 (q.v. Mawdryn Undead, this is clearly inaccurate, as a future story in the same season has the Brigadier still working.  So Sarah should've said she comes from 1975.
Trivia:  at the time of shooting, the property where this was shot belonged to no less a person than Mick Jagger, but before, the house in the story had belonged to Lord Carnarvon, the archaeologist who uncovered King Tut's tomb, so a coincidence there.
Stylish and evenly-paced, with the Egyptology motif a good asset.",1074988800,12,3895,4.803303303303303
369557,5,6301801253,"I didn't see this mentioned in any of the other reviews and I wanted to share it. I thought Professor Scarman was awesome as a villain, even moreso than Sutekh.

369558,5,6301801253,"I remember watching Dr. Who as a boy and being fascinated with the series. I came across this video while browsing and thought why not, with some trepidation that, as an adult, I may have lost the fascination and wonder.
I haven't. This video is terrific. Dr. Who is pulled off-course by a temporal anomaly and lands in 1911 England (amazing how much excitement happens in England). There he discovers that Sutec, the last of the Osirians (a race of cosmic powers and abilities), is attempting to escape his 7,000 year old prison, in Egypt. Sutec was imprisoned there by Osiris after a titanic struggle which so overwhelmed the primitive people living along the Nile at that time that they copied their civilization after these alien beings.
Sutec, the destroyer, hates life and living beings, from fear that one day, some one may grow to match him in power. To prevent that he tried to eradicate all living everywhere in the universe. Thwarted by Osiris, he plotted his revenge for millennia.
Only the Doctor stands in his way. After destroying a missile aimed at Mars (to destroy the generator which imprisons Sutec) by dressing as a mummy robot, Sutec gains control of Dr. Who and forces him to take his minions to Mars. Once there, the Doctor is too late to prevent the generator's destruction.
Only the fact that radio waves travel at light spped while the Doctor travels without speed allows the Doctor to trap Sutec in a temporal tunnel and send him to his death.
I will buy more of these videos.",1015804800,4,1503,4.696969696969697
369559,5,6301801253,"Much  has already been written about this story already but I would like to add my twopence worth. Another fantastic (in every sense of the word) story which sees the expansion of the typical doctor storyline to incorporate eatern religion and mysticism. In some ways the story harks back to the early days of the Doctor where a historical interlude was often to be found sandwiched in between the more fantastic science fiction escapades. But this particular Doctor had more darker episodes than most and I think this one is particularly so.
Predating Stargate by some considerable years, the show postulates a race of immortal beings with a bad apple among them. His crimes were so heinous that he is sentenced to life imprisonment as the other immortals were so reluctant to take any life no matter how evil the crime. Upon gaining his freedom he will destroy all.
Human life counts for nothing as the evil one battles the Doctor to secure his escape and even the will of a Timelord is insufficient to defeat him. In the end, as always the Doctor wins through and sends Sutek to finish off his sentence in a time loop. While we all cheer for his demise it is easy to forget the cruelty of  such a fate and while it may be poetic justice, we should not forget that there are some things worse than death.
One of my personal favourites which ranks with the Robots of Death - two thumbs up!",1015027200,4,1390,4.53386454183267
369560,5,6301801253,"The Pyramids of mars was one of the first episodes that i ever watched. It has a stunning concept and plot. There was action,but not to much so that they over-did it. Pyramids of mars was exceptional from its predecesers. It was a very good example of what you can achieve with good actors,on-location filming and good props and costumes. It was a very controlled episode. It was a good idea using the concept that the whole of what we know as egyptoligy was actually based on an alien race. Pyramids of mars also differd from its others because of the badee. Usually the enermys that the doctor confronts are very mortal and have the flesh and blood concept about them. This was very different in pyramids of mars. Instead the enermy was a mighty god called SUTEK the destroyer. He was unstopable. It was mear luck that the doctor managed to trap him in the time vortex. But wherever there is a bad guy there is allways a good one. HORUS god of light fought sutek and managed to imprison him in an eternity of agonizing pain. Of course he escaped and that was that. This is one enermy that if the doctor slipped up on he would not of been able to stop. I pesonally adore this episode and it will allways remain one of the all time Doctor Who classics.",1011744000,,1252,4.377682403433476
369561,3,6301801253,"I don't know; I think I have to be the dissenting voice and say that I have always found this episode to be a little silly. Even though it does contain a number of fairly gruesome on-screen murders, this is a kiddy story about Egyptian mytholgy around which a Doctor Who adventure is framed. The best thing going for it is the look -- most of Tom Baker's Who episodes are set in the future, and I believe the turn of the century world, sets and props that the story inhabits. There are also some nicely drawn characters, from both of the Scarman borthers and Dr Warlock [great names] to the nice small role of the Poacher. But when Baker intones that ""[Sutek] is the greatest threat I have ever faced"", I just don't buy it. After all of those Daleks, Cybermen, plots by The Master and Krynoids the size of St Paul's Cathedral, I just don't feel like Sutek is the baddest of the bad. He's bad, alright, but not quite bad enough, and that might be because of the 12th grader's perspecitive on explaining who he his and his relationship with Egyptian mytholgy, which is used as a plot device rather than a historical reference. All it serves is to show how alien even Egyptian culture is compared to ""proper"" turn of the century country English life, a similar kind of gentle xenophobia Oriental cultures served in the far more involving ""Talons of Weng Chiang"". Perhaps I am just looking at it from a 21st century perspecitive, but it seems exploitative to use Egyptian mythology as the framework for a plot and then kill off the only significant Egyptian character 26 minutes into the story. The episode does have a powerful and profound moment where the Doctor rather matter-of-factly demonstrates to Sarah the importance of dealing with Sutek's threat in order to preserve the time line she knows, but one electrifying scene cannot a whole adventure make.

369562,5,6301801253,"I'll make no pretense - this is my favorite Doctor Who adventure of all time. It is moody and intense, with brilliant performances by Tom Baker, Lis Sladen, and Gabriel Woolf. No other DW villain has really been so imposing - we never see Sutekh's face (unless that mask -is- Sutekh's face) or see his lips move, but his voice is so powerful and resonant it sends chills down the spine; more than a worthy adversary for the tall and deep-voiced Tom Baker.
The story is nicely claustrophobic, mostly taking place in and around a mansion, with the marvelous sense of a horror movie. The script is another real gem by Robert Holmes (despite the writer's credit, he wrote almost all of what appeared onscreen), and no actor is off-par.
The only downside about this video is that it was one of the first DW videos released, so the four 25-minute episodes have been truncated into a long 95-minute ""movie"". Still, in lieu of an unedited video or DVD release, this is a fine purchase and should be in anyone's Doctor Who collection.",995760000,31,1025,4.60655737704918

7815890,5,6301801253,"I purchased this out of curiosity to compare it with my PAL format Region 2 copy.
As with all my other BBC PAL DVDs the NTSC version has sharper more defined video quality. The filmed scenes look the same, it's the live video that is a bit muted.
I can't say for sure why this is because the extra features look the same in both formats.
Both versions of this release are identical, same features and extras.
Region 2 version is packaged in silver-grey case with different artwork and chapter list insert.
I like both but I prefer the slightly sharper image of the NTSC version.
The PAL release is very good, it just looks a bit more like grainy film.*

An excellent production for the Tom Baker Who era, one of the absolute best!
Impressive performance by Mr. Bernard Archard (Marcus Scarman). A very professional and accomplished actor.
He reminds me of the great Mr. Boris Karloff.

Definitely one of my personal favorite stories, an undisputed classic.

Easter egg-
Same content in both formats but different locations, go to Extras Menu scroll down to Osiran Gothic and go Left, click on Doctor Who logo for NTSC Region 1, for PAL Region 2 scroll down to Oh Mummy!, go left and click.

*Update 11.25.17
