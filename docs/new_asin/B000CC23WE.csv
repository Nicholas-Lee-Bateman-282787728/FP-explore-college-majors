8096833,1,B000CC23WE,"When we tried to play this video it didn't work in two machines.  Very disappointing as my kids loved this when they were children and it was going to be a birthday gift.  Also, the box came with writing on it.  I thought, from the description of product that it was new, but apparently not.",1397174400,,291,4.254545454545455
8096834,5,B000CC23WE,"The only thing wrong with this film is that it is nearly impossible to find on DVD!! It is amazing & I used to watch it as a small child.  This movie, & those like it, are what my kids are going to watch while they grow up, not the crap that's out there today.",1313193600,,260,3.727272727272727
8096835,5,B000CC23WE,This is a great childrens movie that adults can enjoy too.  A bit trippy (think Alice in Wonderland) but a good storyline and great annimation.  Would love for this to come out on blu-ray but would settle for even a DVD!  Definately worth a couple bucks to check out the VHS version if you still have a VCR.,1307059200,,307,4.258620689655173
8096836,5,B000CC23WE,"The story of a painter falling asleep under the enchanted elm where he is given magical powers. As has been proclaimed by a prophecy. He is then pursued by the cactus king who will do all in his power to prevent the prophecy from coming true. With charming animation and song as we older generation know. At it's best ""The Elm Chanted Forest"" is truly a gem to any movie library. May it hopefully find it's way to DVD or Blue Ray.",1306454400,,430,4.2560975609756095
8096837,5,B000CC23WE,"This was the very first movie I connected with as a child and has been my favorite movie ever since.  No other movie can match its story, way of animation, or hidden messages so well.  This movie suits so many situations and is great for people of all ages.  This movie makes big time movies like the Matrix look like backyard videotape.  Elm-Chanted Forest Now and Forever!",983404800,,374,4.537313432835821
