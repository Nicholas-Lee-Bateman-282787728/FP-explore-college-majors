(1) is easy to understand for (beginners/massage therapists) with rudimentary anatomy;
(2) Facilitator is skilled and sitting outside on rocks - in nature - very nice.
(3) A couple of good hand-arm stretches shown (which I have been doing already, but this is a good reminder)
(4) And, as the DVD is intended, excellent to watch, show, loan to clients with carpal tunnel/syndrome.
(4a) He walks us through the 'assessment' steps - while preliminary, they are good to know and do/use on a client.
(5) He encourages a lot of self-care and preventative-care, and equally encourages/stresses people to see medical providers as required/needed to deal with more serious injuries or needs.
(6) As I do not have carpal tunnel, and initially thought I did, it is not specific to my personal needs (now, thank God).  However, it is really a good reminder that all bodyworkers need to take care of their own body !
Good to have in your library.",1412121600,,1055,4.759562841530054
