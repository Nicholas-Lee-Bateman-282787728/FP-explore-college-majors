6966632,3,B00SADQOEU,"Doug Harris (Josh Gad) has a good job and is marrying a woman (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) way out of his league. Unfortunately Doug doesn't have any male friends close enough to be best man or grooms men. He lies about this to his future wife which forces him to hire them through Best Man Inc. employing the services of quick thinking golden tongue Kevin Hart. Hart hires a group of seven misfits to fill in. Doug and Hart bond during this time, while the film pays little attention to Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, in what seems to be a bad role for her.

I couldn't help think that the role of Doug Harris would have been better played by a younger Jonah Hill. Kevin Hart was hit and miss during the film with the low point being the dog/peanut butter scene which was juvenile stupid. What were the writers? 14 years old? A good film for those that like dumb sex comedies that pretend to be meaningful.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex talk. Brief topless flash (What was that? 1 frame?) Crass Dog/peanut scene",1422057600,,987,4.5083798882681565
6966633,3,B00SADQOEU,"This is a buddy/ odd couple comedy movie.

It's mildly entertaining without being particularly memorable.

What is it about? Doug (Josh Gad) is a hard working successful attorney who is getting married to Gretchen (Kaley (Big Bang Theory) Cuoco-Sweeting). He's having trouble finding a best man, so he engages Jimmy (Kevin Hart), a smooth talking professional best man for hire. We follow their journey to wedding day.

Is this a funny movie? I thought it had its moments. Messrs Hart and Gad try hard to extract humor from their characters' unusual relationship. Ms Cuoco-Sweeting's role is relatively minor, although it is pivotal to the twist at the end of the movie.

Is it worth seeing? I thought it was mildly entertaining as a light comedy entertainment, but I wouldn't give it a second viewing.",1421971200,2,802,4.962686567164179
6966634,4,B00SADQOEU,"The Wedding Ringer was an enjoyable comedy to kick off the year with. It stars Kevin Hart as Jimmy Callahan, owner of TBM, Inc, or, to insiders, The Best Man, Inc. Jimmy offers ""best man"" services to grooms that find themselves lacking in the friend department, but is quick to remind his clients that any relationship they may have is strictly business. Doug Harris (Josh Gad) finds himself in a similar situation when he gets engaged to Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) and can't find anyone to be a groomsman, let alone his best man. He's lied to Gretchen about his 8 friends that will fill up his side of wedding party, and he doesn't want to come clean because he knows that Gretchen is out of his league and coming clean about his lack of friends isn't even a possibility. With 10 days left before the wedding, Gretchen and Doug's wedding planner Edmundo (Ignacio Serricchio) becomes wise to Doug's lies and refers him to Jimmy. Jimmy ultimately agrees to pretend to be Doug's best man, Bic Michum, along with putting together 7 groomsmen, an impossible feat known in the business as The Golden Tux.

Overall, I thought this movie was really funny, with several hilariously memorable scenes. If you like Kevin Hart in general, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this movie. Similarly, if you liked a Think Like A Man or Think Like A Man Too, you'll find some similar faces in the movie, especially with that of Jimmy's assistant, Doris (Jenifer Lewis, or Loretta from the Think movies).

I read an interesting interview with Jeremy Garelick, one of the screenwriters who penned the script (and the director) for The Wedding Ringer, and he said that he originally wrote the part of Jimmy for Vince Vaughn about 10 or so years ago. Instead of the studio making this movie, however, a pitch for Wedding Crashers ended up being green-lit and turned into a script and then movie instead. In the interview, Garelick was asked if he had to change the script a lot to adapt it to a nerdy white guy hiring a black guy to be his best man, versus Vince Vaughn. He basically said that the underlying message of the film was friendship, not race, so there wasn't anything really to address or change. I agree with that and thought it was a funny movie with lots of laughs, but the heart of the movie was about friendship.

This movie did a great job of overcoming a big problem that many comedies fall victim to - the third act slump. Usually when a comedy tries to wrap up the plot and bring it toward a resolution, the movie tends to drag and be too serious without many laughs as the main character is coming clean or learning his lesson, or something similar. It's hard to keep the right balance of heart and seriousness, while still staying funny. For this movie, obviously you can guess that Doug will eventually have to come clean, or maybe Jimmy and Doug will really become friends, but the movie kept moving and stayed consistently funny throughout, which is a feat I don't see too often.

Overall - I laughed hard and loud throughout most of the movie and would definitely recommend it. It was a fun, funny movie.",1421798400,29,3109,4.606498194945848
6966635,3,B00SADQOEU,"Sony releases a comedy about a groomsmans desperate attempt to find a best man and fellow friends to attend his wedding. Doug Harris is about to marry the love of his life until he realizes that he doesnt have friends to join in. Doug reaches out to Jimmy Callahan whos business is to find his clients groomsmen but with a price. The film stars Kevin Hart and Josh Gad in a film about two people who find friendship in the unlikeliest of ways.

I have a lot of respect for Kevin Hart because hes one of those actors who can really make audiences laugh. Hes very fun to watch because of his ability to just meld with characters and bring out the best in them. So was the case with The Wedding Ringer as he plays Jimmy Callahan who does business with Doug (Josh Gad) and has knock out loud moments to the point of absurdity. And you have to give credit to Josh Gad who has good chemistry with Hart throughout the movie. To my amazement they worked so well together that if they were to do another film together I could see it happening and would be interested in seeing it.

The premise of the movie has a lot going for it and could turn out to be a great comedy with something we haven't seen before. However, as funny as the movie could be at times it certainly lost that momentum after the first 20 minutes into the film. The set-up of Harts character being the wedding ringer for another client to what his job entails is a great opener. Then we follow Doug who is anxious to death about who his groomsmen are going to be, let alone his best man. And you even get to like his soon to be wife Gretchen, played by Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, whos character is someone you don't usually see marrying a guy like that of Doug. You could genuinely believe that they were in love with one another and not in a forced manner.

Once Doug and Jimmy begin working together the movie becomes a movie about the journey to the wedding and everything in-between. I will say the groomsmen that Jimmy chose for Doug was essentially the funniest group in the film. They were a combination of criminal, TSA, and a stutterer who all together made for great entertainment. Just watching them take on roles of people made up by Doug was funny because of how opposite they were to their real selves. And I have to mention the lunch scene over at Gretchens parents house. When Doug was about to come clean after not being able to go along with the lie a bowl of chili is dumped on his lap. The trailer made it seem funnier at the time cause of the editing but when it came down to actually watching the scene play out your a little bit underwhelmed. Maybe because wed already seen it in the trailer?

I really like the premise of the film but despite the laughs it becomes a one time viewing that doesnt leave an impression by the end. Seeing Josh Gad and Kevin Hart work together was awesome and shows how great they are together. Potentially we could be seeing more films with them together cause they really hit it off. Overall, audiences will find something to root for in The Wedding Ringer but won't be as good as it couldve been.",1421452800,,3108,4.335051546391752
6966636,4,B00SADQOEU,"Outrageous!  We laughed all the way through this (well, at least most of the way).  This is definitely not a movie for the kids - there is a lot of offensive material, lots of crass humor, and you'll likely find something in there to offend your movie-going companion with.  But this is funny, well-written, has some great cameo-like scenes, and even has some surprising depth to it.

The premise, something many men have probably gone through, or almost wished they could go through, is that the socially awkward groom (Josh Gad) needs a best man (Kevin Hart).  He goes to a company that provides this as a service, and following are all the situations that make it a winner.  There is even some depth of character and relationship between the groom and his new best man.  And in fact, all of his groomsmen, because he hires out the whole team.

Josh Gad was fantastic, what a role for him. He really made the movie, and I think we will be seeing more from him.  Kevin Hart is always funny, and can even turn the occasionally lame gag into something worthwhile.

Do not expect a lot of plot, and recognize this for what it truly is.  Just sit back, relax, and smile - throw your expectations of Oscar winning direction and production out the window, and have a good laugh.",1421366400,,1273,4.5152838427947595

6966710,4,B00SADQOEU,"THE WEDDING RINGER

I have always been a fan of these buddy comedies and have been a fan of Kevin Hart since before he blew up. So when this movie came out I knew I would be all about it. I also liked the rest of the cast here so I was looking forward to this flick. So I headed to the theaters to see it and eventually bought this Blu-Ray. Obviously I enjoyed it or I wouldnt have got it.

The story follows a guy named Doug Harris who is getting married to the woman of his dreams. The problem is that he does not have any friends to make up his groomsmen. That is when he learns of a service that will help guys out with that. This company called Best Man Inc. is run by a guy named Jimmy Callahan. He provides everything a guy may need from the groomsmen [himself as best man] to the bachelor party among other things. So as the wedding grows closer the party gets bigger, but things may not go as planned as things fall apart.

This is a very fun movie with a fun cast that all work very well together, you can see the chemistry that they all had with each other. The movie is funny from the cast to the script by writers Jay Lavender and Jeremy Garelick [who also directed] who also wrote The Break Up together. I have to say the best scene in the film is probably the dance scene, love it.

The Blu-Ray comes with behind the scenes stuff, gag reels, deleted scenes, commentary and a great music video by Aloe Blacc. This is recommended to any comedy fan out there that is just looking to shut down and relax. Not the greatest comedy ever made but worth a watch for sure.

6967004,5,B00SADQOEU,"Make no bones about it this movie is a total hoot.  Director Jeremy Garelick references Judd Apatow and Todd Phillips by orchestrating the raunch with the sentimental while tailoring the film around Kevin Hart's incandescent comic persona.  It's obvious that Hart's part was originally written for a white actor but he effortlessly makes smooth talking Jimmy Callahan his own creation.  Josh Gad is terrific playing straight man to Hart and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting goes against type as Gad's gold digging fiance.  My favorite bit is the ""groomsman"" who pulls his arm out of its socket.

It's funny from start to finish and the jokes range from subtle things that don't get a HA HA but make you smile or chuckle nonetheless, to in your face ""That just happened..."" humor.  This year Kevin also did Get Hard and this is by far the better of the two.  I think one of the things that makes it a truly enjoyable movie is that despite it being a raunchy comedy in parts, the characters (most of them) are not 2 Dimensional.

6967084,5,B00SADQOEU,"This movie made me laugh out loud several times.

This is at the top of my list of the funniest movies that I have ever seen.
I could watch this over and over.

This movie was fast-paced, interesting, different, funny, and touching.
I really cared about the characters.

All of the actors in this movie did a great job, but the actors who played Doug and Jimmy were really amazing.

The actor who played Doug was also in ""Thanks For Sharing"" which was also a really good movie.

I loved the ending.

SPOILERS

How many people noticed that, at the end, after all of the credits have rolled, there is an extremely short scene of Doug and Jimmy playing tennis.  It didn't look like they were getting along, and I would like to hear anyone's opinion on that.

I wondered about two things.

(1) What about the issue of the possibility of blackmail?
Any groom who uses this service should worry that, after the wedding, he is in a vulnerable position. Anyone who knew that the best man and groomsmen were fake, including the men themselves, could have blackmailed the groom after the wedding. They could simply go to the groom and demand money from him, or else they will tell the bride and everyone the truth. They could continue asking for more and more money for years.
These were good guys, so they obviously would never do that, but any groom could not know that because these are complete strangers to him. And anyone else who knew the truth could be a blackmailer, not just the men.

(2) What about the possibility that anyone attending these large weddings could recognize the best man or the groomsmen, from other weddings that they may have attended, or from the theme park where they worked, or from anywhere? These large weddings could have a guest who happens to know one of the men.
There actually was a part in the movie where Jimmy realized that the priest knew him, but Jimmy managed to get out of that situation.
But in a large wedding, it would be difficult to avoid anyone recognizing these men.  That is a big risk for the groom to take.

Of course, I am taking the movie too seriously, it is a comedy and it is not supposed to be analyzed, just enjoyed.

As soon as Jimmy said that no one lives in North Dakota, I knew that someone at the wedding would be from North Dakota.

I also guessed that the guy playing the podiatrist would be questioned at the wedding. At least, someone would start asking him medical questions regarding some foot problem, because as soon as people hear that you are a doctor, they want free advice. But it was surprising to me that he met another podiatrist, and when he had to make up a school on the spot, he said the same school that that podiatrist went to.

But again, I loved every minute of this movie.",1439337600,,2754,4.4453280318091455

He runs a business based on exploiting the groom without best men. Kevin hires a group of misfits to become the wedding party to a wealthy groom to pull off the wedding of a lifetime. Not a moral based movie at all and breaks down the sanctity and context of marriage is all about, still, the movie entertains as most secular movies do.",1436832000,,472,4.630952380952381

6967238,5,B00SADQOEU,Comedy at its best. Kevin Hart brings it to home plate in the Wedding Ringer. Not for children under the age of 15 if you ask me. I know some of you with new age parenting skills took your 8 year old... saw you in the theater. This movie is best watched on the start of your second beer and ends well with the 6 pack finished. Great for couples and anyone who likes crying due to moments of extreme laughter. If you don't like this movie..... I would recommend silent films from the early 1900s for you.,1436745600,5,503,4.142857142857143

6967380,3,B00SADQOEU,"Doug Harris a successful tech guy meets the girl of his dreams who agrees to marry him, however he has no real friends to be his groomsman, so what is a man to do? Naturally he goes to Jimmy Callahan (Hart) to find himself a best man and some groomsman. Then the hilarity ensues. Or at least a couple of chuckles. Josh Gad is likable and Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart ( does he have an original character?). There are a few funny scenes like the groomsman trying to create memories or when they play some touch football with the dad.
However what really bothered me were the portrayals of the female characters. Jelly Cuoco is wasted as the shrewish bride to be, though there is a great The Usual Suspect moment that actually made me laugh. Why are all women who are getting married as being one dimensional and annoying in Hollywood movies. The great Mimi Rogers is wasted in a do nothing part and blink and you'll miss Cloris Leachman. Also all the bridemaides are portrayed as annoying and loud. The two nice woman were either a hooker or someone who easily falls for somebody without knowing them.
Seen this all before. The Usual Suspect scene and the last line by Jorge Garcia made up the one extra star.",1435104000,,1204,4.452488687782806

Kevin Hart certainly is not the first comedian to pigeon-hole himself into a very specific character style in films, but it would be nice to see a departure into something a little wittier now and then.

6967454,3,B00SADQOEU,"The Wedding Ringer was a little slow overall, it does have some funny scenes but the viewer is dragged through a lot of filler to get to them, such as the muddy football game.  Overall it's a predictable story, what you expect when you hit play will have happened by the end of the film, does.  Some of the funniest site gags such as the dog and peanut butter one you could see coming from when the set up was put in motion, but still you can't help but laugh when you see something like that is played out.  There was a little bit too much primary school boy toilet humour in parts such as a character constantly showing everyone his third down below accessory.  Kaley Cuoco, if you're getting this because you're a Big Bang fan, you may be disappointed as she's not in it other than a few scenes. She doesn't really have any fun or witty lines.  I'm guessing she had other commitments, The Wedding Ringer is really a Josh Gad and Kevin Hart performance.  It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's not trying to be plausible.  Worth watching once but it doesn't have enough to make you want to own it for repeat viewings.",1434240000,,1137,4.360189573459715

It was predictable, and the football scene seemed like it was just a compulsory graphic football scene where they go against the Bride's family and get beat up, just like in Wedding Crashers. There was really no point to it and it felt like it kept going on and on. There was also a huge plot hole (spoiler alert)... if Bic was the one that did the wedding and they knew they weren't going to be legally married, what would he have done if they actually loved each other and wanted to stay married? Why would they have had Bic do the wedding if they knew it wasn't legal? Makes no sense and clearly the writers didn't really think that one through.",1433980800,,899,4.2631578947368425

However, Douglass Harris is in need of an entire wedding party, also knows as a Golden Tux.  So, Douglass hires Jimmy to try to pull the task that has never been before by Jimmys business.  The two had a good repertoire with each there, but I think there was was too much profanity.  In the addition, the writing could use more quality like the scene where Jimmys secretary reminds him of why he got into the business.  This was probably the best written scene in the movie.  In the end, the duo don't pull off the  Golden Tux and this the conclusion of the movie; they don't quite pull it off, but does have its funny parts.",1433980800,,773,4.319444444444445

6967548,3,B00SADQOEU,"As I was watching this movie, I kept thinking that the title is such a good play on words, I wonder if the script was just added to fit the title.  In any case, it isn't much more than an opportunity for Kevin Hart to show his comedic skills in a feature film.  He plays Jimmy Callahan, who provides ""best man"" services to friendless men about to get married.  Not surprisingly, this appears to be a real business.

Doug Harris (Josh Gad) is about to marry a girl ""out of his league"" by his own accounts.  Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) is planning a huge wedding and Doug needs a best man and 7 groomsmen.  But he has no friends.  He's made up some for Gretchen, but they don't exist.  So he goes to Jimmy who agrees to do the once in a lifetime ""Golden Tux"" where he supplies the men, including their scripted alter-egos.

Often the film just goes over the top.  For example, Gretchen's father (Ken Howard) obviously doesn't like Doug, and lures him into a ""touch"" football game.  You know, he and his old buddies, including characters played by former NFLers Joe Namath, John Riggins and Ed `Too Tall' Jones, against the young upstarts.  Hart and occasionally Gad provide a few good laughs including a funny scene at a ""practice wedding"" where the duo provide some great dance moves together.  So while Hart can always be hilarious, frankly I'd rather watch him do standup or even a short segment on ESPN's ""Mike and Mike.""

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  You certainly will have no problem with the look of the film.  Colors are deep, detail is excellent.  Clothing, skin tones are perfect.  This is as good as it gets when it comes to Blu ray.  Audio is provided using DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and I have no real complaints here either.  It has excellent imaging and enough surround morsels to get noticed, perhaps just a bit too much.  Dialog is well placed, clear and consistent.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include an audio commentary with director Jeremy Garelick and actor Josh Gad, a host of deleted scenes, some outtakes, a music video, shared real life wedding memories by the cast and crew and some Sony trailers.",1433635200,2,2222,4.612244897959184

I've never seen a movie that contains a best man speech where the start of a sentence begins with ""Adolf Hitler once said..."".  You'll get it when you see it.  The script is tight, with crisp comedic timing and the casting is awesome.
There has, in my opinion, been a dearth of good comedy movies lately, but this one is definitely good comedy and If you need a belly-laugh, this is the movie for you.
It does contain an abundance of four-letter language and (hilarious) sexual situations, so not one for the kiddies.

6967798,3,B00SADQOEU,"This was actually a pretty good movie for the most part, but man did they miss every opportunity possible to put a meaningful ending on it. The feelings and resolutions that you want the filmmakers to flesh out and deliver with began to materialize and then landed with a splat and a thud. ""The Wedding Ringer"" has a lot of good moments for the most part and I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would, but it amazes me how often these high-paid millionaire movie-makers mishandle and misdeliver impactful moments in movies.  There's a moment in this film where everything culminates and you can feel the importance of everything you watched the movie for getting ready to be delivered and then just like the scene where the best man goes unscripted with his speech, so does the movie.

This was a good movie and most people won't care that the entire reason for the movie was mishandled when it finally got there, but I did. That being said, the movie has a lot of truth to it, despite its obvious humorous delivery. The premise revolves around Doug Harris, a guy who is marrying a woman because she is beautiful and she talked to him. He has been so buried in work that he has little to no friends and can't seem to form a collection of groomsmen to match his brides (played by Kaley Cuoco) party. So, with the date nearing he reaches out to Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart) who has an underground business of pretending to be groomsmen and even best men. The movie plays like a comedic spy caper with dossier's and elaborate event stagings etc and it is all very entertaining and frequently funny.

For the most part, this is a funny and good time wasting film but just be prepared to have everything you watched it for be underwhelming when the time comes.",1431907200,2,1766,4.5125

And why is Cuoco even in this if they are not going to USE her comedic talents?  She is a great sounding board and foil in The Big Bang Theory.  She's not just eye candy.  Playing a shallow wife is not her thing.

The worst part is that this movie keeps you WAITING.  You are about to turn it off, then something promising occurs.  Then back to waiting for laughs.  Ugh.

The 2 lead guys make it happen.  Great chemistry, good comedic writing, good timing.  Simple yet interesting premise with the plot.  Good back stories and the others characters were developed enough and were also interesting.  Don't get me wrong, there are just plain ""slap-stick"" moments.  Most of the time my wife & I were laughing hard.  She hates dumb movies. It does get a little ""Vince Vaughnish"" in the moral of the story is...  But all in all, one of the best all around comedic movies I have seen in quite some time. Hurray for Kevin and Josh!  Well done.",1431648000,,720,4.469230769230769

6968006,4,B00SADQOEU,"Face it, Kevin Hart is on a roll when it comes to stardom these days. The stand-up comedian has made it to the big time, moving from ensemble pieces to starring roles these days. But like any stand-up who takes on the big screen there are hits and misses along the way. While this film didn't do huge at the box office perhaps that will turn around with the release on DVD. Once word gets out how funny the movie is its sure to make a splash.

Josh Gad stars as Doug Harris, a man about to marry Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), the woman of his dreams. The problem is hes represented himself as having plenty of friend when in fact he has none. Even grade school acquaintances are unwilling to show up to be even a groomsman. Two weeks until the wedding Doug is faced with the problem and aided by the wedding planner whos seen this problem before.

Doug is sent to meet with Jimmy Callahan (Hart), a best man for hire. For a fee Jimmy will make sure he has groomsmen, become his best man and plan all the accessories that go along with this event. With the short amount of time and the number of groomsmen involved Jimmy isn't sure he can pull it off. No one in his line of work has ever done a group this big. But hes up to the challenge and sets out to gather a team.

Along the way Jimmy has to know everything he possibly can about Doug, creating more than one backstory to fill in the rest. He also has to learn about Doug so he can create the perfect toast as well as be able to be with him at events like the rehearsal dinner and more. The thing is, even though he stresses to Doug that this is a business arrangement and nothing more, Jimmy finds himself becoming friends with Doug as well.

The humor in this film runs throughout and covers all sorts of styles. The buddy film is evident in the back and forth between Gad and Hart with their friendship taking place quickly but logically as well. There is the gross out humor in the team that Hart assembles with each one having their own quirk. There is the predicament humor found in the situations the duo find themselves in when dealing with Gretchens family (one of the funniest scenes comes from this involving fire and a grandmother played by Cloris Leachman). And then there is the overabundant use of language, perhaps the least funny element in the movie. Dropping the F bomb in a movie 40 years ago might have been surprising and played for laughs but these days its overuse slows things down and doesnt fit right.

Hart has proven that he has the acting chops to carry a movie as the solo lead. This film does him credit in that right as he plays the helping con man who saves the day for guys in need of his services. While he may not seem to care he actually feels for each of the men he helps. Hart makes this believable and thats not easy to do with a character who only knows his client for less than two weeks. Gad also turns in a solid performance here as Doug, a man successful in business but who feels his self-worth is non-existent when it comes to women. Having the chance to marry someone as beautiful as Gretchen seems like a dream come true. Now if he can just get past the wedding.

My guess is this movie won't go down as the next best thing since sliced bread but it does offer plenty of laughs if you can get past the language. Popping the disc in I didn't know if it would have anything to offer and I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was more than one moment when I had to pause the movie until I finished laughing. It was fun, the ensemble was good together and the two leads brought to life an implausible situation. I know its worth watching once and for myself, chances are Ill be watching this one again down the line. It was that funny.",1431043200,,3747,4.263009845288327

Doug doesn't have any friends and needs groomsmen. When he is told about Jimmy (Hart) he thinks he found his solution. The more the two get to know each other the more they find out about themselves. I was a little leery about this movie. The previews made it seem funny enough and I really like Josh Gad, but Kevin Hart can sometimes get a little too annoying for me. This is an exception. Hart played it almost perfect and I never once felt like he was too over the top or annoying like in Ride Along. I laughed much more than I was expecting to at this and there is enough types of humor for everyone to find something they will like. There is also enough heart and story in this to keep you interested in what is happening and not just waiting for the next joke. Me and my wife both liked this more than we expected too and this is one of the better comedies to come out in a while. Overall, nothing all that original and pretty predictable but it was very funny and when you rent a comedy that is what you are looking for. To me this is Kevin Hart's best movie I have seen.

6968224,1,B00SADQOEU,After an hour I couldn't take it anymore and had to sbut it off. I don't mind ridiculous movies but this movie was just flat out boring disjointed and worst of all not funny. Waste of 15.00! Do yourself a favor and don't watch this. I think the good reviews were from the dorks in the movie that had no acting skills at all and their friends are trying to pump the movie up.,1429574400,2,374,4.0675675675675675

6968250,4,B00SADQOEU,"I enjoyed this movie a lot because it did not depend totally on Kevin Hart for humor. Also, I loved that it was a different type of storyline... so tired of feeling like I've watched 30 versions of the same movie.",1427673600,,213,4.219512195121951
6968251,5,B00SADQOEU,"I loved this movie. First of all you can't go into this movie with a serious attitude that you are gonna be blown away with academy award winning script. This is a pure comedy with tons of jokes, bad language and drunk people. I recommend watching this movie with friends.",1424217600,10,272,4.46
6968252,5,B00SADQOEU,"This was one of the funniest movies that we've seen in a long time.  My husband and I belly-laughed through most of it.  This is not a family movie in any way, but if you want 2 hours of laughter; check it out.  We will definitely purchase this when it is released.",1423785600,9,265,4.0576923076923075
6968253,3,B00SADQOEU,"Kevin Hart always manages to get a laugh out of me in his movies, but this movie was pretty predictable.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Right away I could tell that the girlfriend Kaley Cuoco was playing didn't really love our main character and that this was a marriage of convenience for her.  Also I could tell that eventually the cat was going to be let out of the bag and everyone was going to find out that Kevin Hart and Josh Grad's characters didn't really know each other but they were going to be friends by the end of the movie.

Even with this movie being totally predictable, I have to admit that it did get some laughs out of me.  I loved how Kevin Hart and his buddies made up a history with Josh Grad, pretty much in like two days by going around taking photos in crazy places.  And it was also really cool to see Jorge Garcia acting again, I loved him in Lost!  The football game with the old guy vs. the young guys was funny and did make me wince a few times as they were tackling one another.

And at the end we do get a nod to Lost with Jorge Garcia saying he, ""Has a bad feeling about this flight.""  That was awesome!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

So like I said before, the movie is very predictable, and it follows the basic format of these buddy movies where two guys are trying to pull off a scheme to fool everyone.  However it does have some good jokes in it and the situational humor is enjoyable.

Overall I'd say this is a movie you rent, not buy.",1422576000,9,1526,4.316901408450704

8697933,3,B00SADQOEU,This is a pretty good movie.  Josh Gad  is going to marry the girl of his dreams.  But he really ha no life.  Or friends so he hires a man.  Kevin Hart to put together a bunch guys to act like his friends and be his best man and groomsmen.  It's a funny set up as they pose to make it look they do everything from scuba diving and sky diving and mountain climbing and playing football.  Kaley Cuoco plays the fiance who is naive and scheming all at the same time.  She doesn't love him.  He just  treats he like a lady.  And he doesn't love her either.  He just is in love with the fact that a man like him can be with a girl like her.,1529712000,,635,3.8372093023255816
