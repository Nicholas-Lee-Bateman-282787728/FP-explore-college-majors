I actually bought the tape because I used to live in Winter Park and am familiar with the location of the workout. But, when watching it there is no scenery to look at, just pots and a mat. So for that reason it was disappointing. If you are new to yoga, it is a straightforward workout, if you are used to yoga you may want to find a more advanced one to try.",1219881600,,453,3.989010989010989
8237642,5,B0010C19HK,"Every time I do this DVD, I feel like I've just come back from a holiday. The movements are so well sequenced as to create a peaceful flow vs. a hard core yoga workout. Erica's voice is so easy to listen to, making it a fantastic guided meditation. And I was blown away by the quaility of the footage. Every time I feel stressed or closed in, I just reach for this DVD and I feel refreshed and open again.",1197936000,,405,4.075
