4246329,5,B0041SI7ES,"Like the others who have taken the time to review this product, I realize this dvd has not been released yet. However, I can't wait to get this dvd and see how WWE lists the greatest of all time and if they will even give a fair assesment. I have been a long time fan and through it all I have witnessed many of the greats from the 80's, 90's and all the way into the new millenium. I gave this a 5 star rateing just for the concept alone and I know the stars that should be on this dvd will be. I also have no doubt that Stone Cold Steve Austin will recieve the #1 spot as Vince Mcmahon has on numerious occasions stated Austin as being the greatest...I don't entirely agree. But I think this will be a fun dvd to watch. Here is my list of the top 10 greatest superstars of all time... 1. The Rock 2. Stone Cold Steve Austin 3. Bret The HitMan Hart 4. Shawn Michaels 5. The Undertaker 6. Ric Flair 7. Macho Man Randy Savage 8. Ricky The Dragon Steamboat 9. John Cena 10.

4246330,2,B0041SI7ES,"What is dumb about the ranking on this dvd is that half the people wouldn't be on the list if they didn't look up to half the people that were left out! I mean Cena is very high on the list and when he first started, he did the Stinger Splash, so it shows that he looked up to Sting, yet Sting isn't even on this dvd!

  Batista is on the list, yet Brock Lesnar isn't when Lesnar is a muscle head with tattoos...that can actually wrestle! The rankings are just bull with Flair and Hogan much lower on the list than Cena and HHH when Cena and HHH wouldn't even be around if it wasn't for guys like Hogan, Sting and Flair. I suppose I'd have Cena on the list but as like number 50, he's a top drawer but half his matches, his opponents carry him until he wins with one move, like Elimination Chamber 2011 for instance. Even 50 year old Sting puts on better matches!

I'll give you my own personal top 10, and see how it compares to McMahon's list when it's released. I'm going to guess, not too many matches.
1-Ric Flair  6-Ted Dibiase (Pre-WWF)
2-Terry Funk  7-Bret Hart

3-Terry Gordy  8-Kurt Angle
4-Big Van Vader  9-Bruiser Brody
5-Stan Hansen  10-Buzz Sawyer

Honorable mention must be given to: Arn Anderson, Randy Savage, Steve 'Dr Death' Williams, Mick Foley/Cactus Jack, Ravishing Rick Rude, Chris Benoit, Steve Austin, Jerry Lawler, The Great Muta, Sabu, Michael Hayes, One Man Gang, Owen Hart, Brock Lesnar, Rob Van Dam, and 'Hot Stuff' Eddie Gilbert.

The men that belong on any intelligent 'Greatest of all time' list (mine is a personal favorite list) include-
Lou Thesz, 'Nature Boy' Buddy Rogers, Dory Funk, Jr, Jack Brisco, Gorgeous George, Killer Kowalski, Rikidozan, Tiger Mask, Harley Race, and so many more i don't have space, my apologies to the many greats i've omitted.

That last sentence, by the way, is more respect paid to the men who paved the way and created this business brick by brick, than Vince McMahon has or ever will give.
I've been lucky enough to get an advance notice on the list of this DVD, unfortunately only the Top 10.
Here it is, according to the WWE and Vince McMahon, the top 10 Greatest Wres..oops, sorry, Sports Entertainers of all time.
1-John Cena  6-Triple H
2-Hulk Hogan  7-The Undertaker
3-John Cena  8-Ultimate Warrior
4-Rey Mysterio Jr  9-Tie:Brutus Beefcake, Koko B Ware
5-John Cena  10-Tie:Andre the Giant, John Cena

Wow, what a list! You WWE fans are sure to love this DVD. Thankfully, it'll be properly edited and blurred, so none of you will be offended by the sight of blood, sweat, or actual physical exertion. Also, the blurring will not only be over the 'F' in WWF, but also over Jim Ross, any potential sudden appearances of Randy Savage, Owen Hart, Chris Benoit, Darren Drozdorf, or Ted Turner, and anyone who ever came into contact with Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka's late girlfriend.

To finish up, my list is quite legit. Good luck arguing that any of your favorite ""superstars"" belong over any of my correct selections. If you want to argue, there are threads for that sort of thing right here on Amazon. Just click on a WWE-related topic, and that's where you can type your counterpoint, which i'm guessing will sound a little like, ""dude u r stoopid. undertaker is best becuz hes dead but can still rassle. bye bye"". Those few with a sprinkle of more wits could nail me with ""Dude, you are stupid. Whoever some of the people in your top 10 are, they're not Superstars. Isn't Buzz Sawyer a comic strip? I've heard of Terry Funk, but Terry Gordy? I think you're making names up to try to sound smart; everyone knows the list is: Austin, Rock, Undertaker, Cena, Rey, Trips, HBK, Ultimate Warrior, and Doink.

4246334,4,B0041SI7ES,"NOTE: This is a one disc version of the previously released 3 disc set featuring only the documentary & bonus extras that were included on the original set.

Without a doubt, one of the most controversial DVD sets of the year here as WWE comprised a list showcasing what they see as the Top 50 Superstars Of All Time. Now let me get this out of the way before anything else in that the selections for this set are really no different than their previous sets ranking superstars (Greatest Wrestling Stars Of 80's & 90's) in that it's always going to be controversial no matter who or how they rank the superstars because WWE will never come out with a list that pleases everyone because everyone has a different criteria & view along with the obvious case in that WWE will show a heavy bias towards talents that they created or are in their ""good graces"" against those who aren't for obvious reasons (such as the on-again/off-again relationship with Hulk Hogan who's currently TNA). Speaking of Hogan, he even said it himself that the list is nothing more than a ""work"" which at the end of the day, it is & you just can't take too seriously or think about too much because it is what it is with the fact being that the rankings on this list don't hold any relevance outside of this DVD set.

Now the documentary itself is hosted by Todd Grisham & has a short two min. profile for every 51 superstars (watch or read the list to see how they got that number) with various talents from the past & present giving comments on the wrestler with some of the comments being from old interviews & a few new ones. Throughout the presentation, you'll hear from: Paul ""The Butcher"" Vachon, Ronnie Garvin, John Cena, Gerald Brisco, William Regal, Jerry Lawler, Triple H, J.J. Dillion, Josh Matthews, Matt Striker, Dolph Ziggler, Kofi Kingston, Santino Marella, The Miz, Arnold Skalland, Antonio Anoki, Dory Funk Jr., Ted Dibiase Sr., Terry Funk, Shannon Moore, Gregory Helms, Chris Jericho, Edge, Jim Ross, Honky Tonk Man, Pat Patterson, Jim Brunzel, Christian, Michael Hayes, Gene Okerland, MLB star Wade Boggs, Ric Flair, Billy Kidman, H.D. Smith, Vince McMahon, Bobby Heenan, Ken Patera, Hulk Hogan, Ron Simmons, Jim Cornette, Fabulous Moolah, Joey Styles, Billy Graham, Ernie Ladd, Sgt. Slaughters, Stephanie McMahon, Mae Young, Sensational Sherri, M.V.P., Steve Williams, John Morrison, Steve Austin, Arn Anderson, Harley Race, The Destroyer, ex-NWA president Bob Geigel, Rey Mysterio, Michael Cole, George Steel, ex-NWA referee Tommy Young, Greg Valentine, Roddy Piper, Bruce Prichard, Blackjack Lanza, Rocky Johnson, and Vince McMahon Sr.

In the end, I already gave my feelings on the ""rankings"" of this list but I was just happy to see profiles & comments on certain wrestlers that you don't really hear about much anymore (Killer Kowalski, Georgous George, Lou Thesz, Bruno Sammartino, Freddie Blassie) along with some of my past favorites (Ted Dibiase Sr., Rick Rude, Jake Roberts, Terry Funk). Overall, I liked the presentation they gave us & the rare matches that were fun to watch for the most part so overall if you can get past the entire ""rankings"" then this is something I would recommend for a viewing.",1396137600,2,3207,4.8699633699633695

4246339,1,B0041SI7ES,"If this list had been made when Hogan was on good terms and still active in the WWE, he would have easily been 1 or 2. Same with Flair. It's a travesty to put such big names ranked so low and then turn around have guys like Edge, Cena, Race, Steamboat, Piper, Mysterio, Guerrero, Savage(RIP), Triple H, Perfect,  and  Dusty Rhodes all ahead of Hogan. Most of these guys wouldn't, in all honesty, put themselves ahead of Hogan. Especially the younger guys. Race, Steamboat and Rhodes were great, but they were never at the level of Hogan. They were active when he was but they didn't tranform the business the way he did. Same with Piper. His best attribute was his mouth. Nothing more. Perfect was great and should have been given the WWE belt at least once but never did. Piper maybe too but Vince didn't do so. I guess this is his way of paying them back.

Like I said, if this were made 5 or 10 years ago, no question, Hogan or Flair would have been at the one spot. I could even live with top 5 due to Michaels and Undertaker being so great. They are constants of the WWE the last 20 years and deserve to be near the top, but neither of those guys were game changers like Hogan, regardless of anything he may or may not have done behind the scenes.

Matches Include:
WWE Womens Champion Fabulous Moolah vs. Susan Green - This was one of those matches that showcases how Moolah was able to sell & make her opposition look good as Moolah was on the defense for most of the bout.  Green has a superior height different over Moolah & used it to her advantage with moves like Andre The Giant's body scissors into a ""hot seat"" atomic drop while Moolah had to cheat to get an advantage & take advantage of Green missing a critical move to get the win.
""MSG"" June '75

Gorilla Monsoon confronts Muhammed Ali - This was one of the two most famous incidents linked to Monsoon's career as we saw what happened when Ali decided to step into the ring against Gorilla after a match leading to something we didn't usually see...""The Greatest"" on his back & leaving the ring after he had enough.
June '76

Boxing Match: Andre The Giant vs. Gorilla Monsoon - ""Gorilla Monsoon is the only man in the world to have wrestled Muhammed Ali & box Andre The Giant"" is the phrase that highlights Gorilla's two most famous moments in his career & you get the second half of that statement here.  The the video quality isn't real clear & the ""match"" itself isn't anything special past a few chuckles at watching how Monsoon was knocked out...twice.
Sept. '77
[Andre The Giant]

WWWF Champion Billy Graham vs. Dusty Rhodes - This was the beginning of a series of battles between two of the most charismatic wrestlers at that time. Dusty just knew knew how to work the crowd and had them hot for every single thing he did while Graham tried to ground Dusty with headlocks & bear hugs. This was a good start to a classic series.
""MSG"" Sept. '77
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Iron Sheik - Before the match, you get a classic Iron Sheik ""Iran #1"" rant from him on the microphone.  With the exception of a few punches & kicks, this was a complete dominate performance by Hogan from the minute he hit the ring to ending the year the same way he began it, dominating the Sheik for the WWE Championship.
""MSG"" Dec. '84

Elimination Match: Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage, Harley Race, Adrian Adonis - This match was significant for a matter of reasons in that this was a WrestleMania III preview as the participants in the top 3 undercard matches went against each other here & this was Roddy Piper's last appearance in MSG before his retirement.  It should also be noted that the manager Slick was on commentary for this match leading to some funny heelish comments towards Junkyard Dog.  This was a fun six man tag that kept getting out of control with so many men getting involved leading to a double count out at one point between two participants but I was personally happy to see who the final participants were because it was a ""dream match"" I've always wanted to see but never knew it happened until now.
""MSG"" Feb. '87

Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude - Almost 5 years before their more memorable series of matches in WCW series, they met here in what could come off more as a preview for those later encounters.  This was a match that had it's good mix of technical wrestling such as Steamboat heavily working over Rude's arm.  The pace picked up over time & towards the end had so many near falls that were just so close with Bobby Heenan making his presence felt from time to time including after the match.""MSG"" Dec. '87

AWA Champion Jerry Lawler vs. Curt Hennig - This isn't the famous match where Lawler beat Hennig for the AWA Title in Memphis but a rematch with Curt Hennig having Madusa (Alundra Blayze in WWE) in his corner.  This was a nice match between the two with Lawler always having a limited offense but knew how to work with what he had while Curt worked over Lawler for most of the match & even resorted to dirty tactics like using Madusa's shoe at one point.  Again, it was a nice match.
""AWA"" Aug. '88

No Disqualification Match: Jake Roberts vs. Ted DiBiase - Along with the ""No DQ"" rule, Virgil was also banned from ringside for this match.  Despite the fact that this was a No DQ match, they still wrestled a very technical match without having to resort to bending the rules to the point where the No DQ rule was almost unnecessary.  Great storytelling here by both men with Jake Roberts working over Ted's arm with armbars & kneedrops while Dibiase applied moves like a swinging neckbreaker & piledriver to work over Roberts' previously injured neck.
""MSG"" Dec. '89

WWE Champion Ric Flair vs. Bret Hart - This was probably the most requested match that WWE had yet to release onto a DVD set but you finally get it here.  Don't know what else what to say except you got what you expected from these two in that it was a great technical match that went back & forth between both men who both worked over the legs including both men using a figure four at one point.  For those who saw Bret Hart's DVD, keep in mind that is a part in this match were Bret dislocates his finger only for him to pop it back in place with Mr. Perfect giving a look saying ""UGH, that was nasty.""  Bottom line, a lost classic that finally made it's way to a DVD set.
Oct. '92

Empty Arena Match: WWE Champion The Rock vs. Mankind - This was Mankind's title rematch from the ""I Quit"" match at the Royal Rumble a week earlier & was a halftime special during the Super Bowl. This was the first ever Empty Arena match in WWF history and is a glorified ""Falls Count Anywhere"" match as it should also be noted that Vince McMahon did the commentary for this match. For those who saw any of their matches from this feud knows exactly what to expect here as you had entertaining moments from The Rock's taunts (even throwing Mr. Socko in a kitchen oven, taking phone calls & coming onto a woman in the middle of the fight) to Mankind being his usual ""goofy"" comedic self at times to the point where he lost one of his boots. But more importantly as you would expect from a ""falls count anywhere match"", they went anywhere & everywhere from with hardcore brawling...ringside area, the arena seats, the kitchen, catering area, the outside loading dock, and even a private office using anything they can get their hands on in the process including a couple of things that would bring a new meaning to the term ""food fight."" This was one of the most entertaining matches that you'll ever see in your life.
""Halftime Heat"" Jan. '99
[Mick Foley: Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. The Undertaker - This took place before the Armageddon PPV that would see all four of these men participate in the only 6 man Hell In A Cell match.  On the previous RAW, Kurt Angle formed an alliance with Triple H & Rikishi to take out Austin & Taker & Rock so Kurt was singled out by all three right from the start before it eventually broke down into every man for himself with everyone involved having a confrontation at one point before the other two members of the upcoming Cell match made their presence known but it was a fun TV match for what it was.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '00

Undertaker & Kane & Hardy Boyz vs. Steve Austin, Triple H, Edge, Christian - This happened the week before the Backlash PPV with all the members of both teams having issues with members of the other teams in some way, shape, or form within the past month or more and it should be noted as well that this was early into the notorious ""heel"" Austin run of 2001.  I don't know how else to describe or describe this match as anything else but a wild brawl as the action wasn't able to be contained most of the time with everyone fighting in the ring or on the floor with the action starting off hot & never slowing down with the main story here of how Kane's injured arm continued to be worked on & punished throughout the match.
""RAW"" April 01

Edge & Triple H vs. Kurt Angle & Chris Jericho - This was a preview of the upcoming Judgment Day PPV with the underline story being the underline friction between Triple H & Edge.  This was a match full of non-stop action with both teams actually working well together with some standout moments like how one feud ended up in into a fight through the crowd while another one in this match took a hard chair shot to the face.  This was a fun TV tag match.
""SmackDown"" May 02

Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show - As eluded to my the announce team, this was a rematch from No Mercy months earlier & Eddie still looking for revenge for Big Show tossing him through a windshield of a low rider before that event with Show adding an extra incentive for himself stating that he would quit if he lost.  Show dominated early with his heavy showcasing of power even catching Eddie in midair off the top rope while attempting to punish his arm.  Eddie was able to use his speed against Show & even doing a bit of his ""lie, cheat, steal"" tactics with a ringside wrench & even catching Big Show with a DDT from the top rope.  This was a good main event for TV.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '04

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton - P.O.D. performed Rey Mysterio to the ring as Orton attacked Kurt with the belt right from the start with Angle responding with not only a german suplex on Orton but another one on him & Mysterio at the same time before giving an assist to Rey lifting him up in the air for a top rope frankensteiner allowing Rey to take control as he was able to roll through a sunset flip attempt into a knockout kick followed by a head scissor takeover however Angle was able to counter an attempted 6-1-9 attempt into the anklelock & later catching Orton in the anklelock with the referee distracted both times as he kept deliver impactful german suplexes & an Angle Slam that sent one challenger over the top rope only for each man to come back with a big move from Orton's RKO to Angle's top rope belly to belly suplex & Rey delivering a 6-1-9 around the ring post before it came down to come man being able to ""divide & conquer"" long enough to get the victory.  This was what a triple threat was designed to be in that it was non-stop action from all three men delivering one big move after another with each man looking like they had a chance but the major downfall of this (depending on how you want to look at it) is that this match was under 10 minutes when you would expect more from a World Championship match at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania 22
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man]

John Cena & Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker & Batista - This match was set under very unique circumstances in that both tag teams were comprised of a champion & his challenger for the upcoming WrestleMania while Michaels & Cena were also the current World Tag Team Champions as well.  We all know that we can depend on Undertaker & HBK to give us a match of the night while Cena & Batista have bad reputations for being champions ""who can't wrestle"" but I'll go on record as to say that I wouldn't call this a lost classic but definitely delivered a quality performance from all men involved with Cena & Batista stepping up their game to keep up with the veterans including Cena doing such moves as a leg drop for the top rope & his old ""throwback.""  Again, a great tag team match that was often forgotten about until now.
No Way Out 07

World Champion Edge vs. Undertaker - Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually delivers...and this was no exception. Edge worked on Taker's back throughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose. Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (Devil's Gate).
WrestleMania XXIV

Other matches feature 3 NWA Championship matches including Lou Thesz vs. Argentina Rocca, Harley Race vs. Terry Funk, and Jack Brisco vs. Dory Funk Jr. (the last two were joined in progress).  In the end, I already gave my feelings on the ""rankings"" of this list but I was just happy to see profiles & comments on certain wrestlers that you don't really hear about much anymore (Killer Kowalski, Georgous George, Lou Thesz, Bruno Sammartino, Freddie Blassie) along with some of my past favorites (Ted Dibiase Sr., Rick Rude, Jake Roberts, Terry Funk).  The matches were a real highlight here too as we didn't get any repeats from recent sets while also getting some lost classics (FINALLY! Bret's first championship win), forgotten matches (like Piper vs. Savage in the six man tag), & rare moments from their vault (Monsoon vs. Ali) which is always welcomed.  Overall, I liked the presentation they gave us & the rare matches that were fun to watch for the most part so overall if you can get past the entire ""rankings"" then this is something I would recommend for a viewing.",1296000000,16,15531,4.5253390435403285
4246352,4,B0041SI7ES,"The WWE did a great job with DVD ...

The WWE these style of DVD's very well",1295222400,,134,4.0
4246353,3,B0041SI7ES,"All and all, this program was worth watching.  It did a mini-biography on 51 different superstars from the past to present.  I think EVERYONE found disagreements in the order but the biggest disrespectful position for me was where they placed Hulk Hogan.  I don't want to give away any numerical order, but this was a slap in Hogan's face.  I'm not saying that Hogan should have been number 1, but he was SURELY not where he needed to be...Not Even Close!  I'm also disappointed of some of the superstars that didn't make the list.  The 51 on there are no doubt outstanding in their own right, but doing the top 50 of ALL TIME, this video came up short on in my opinion.

The number 1 picked superstar in my opinion was an awesome man, no doubt about it...but number 1???  I don't think so.  Top 20?  Maybe...Much better than number 1.

If you're a wrestling fan, especially classic wrestling like me, it's not a waste of your time.  Keep in mind it was the current superstars that picked this list and I don't even know who most of them are anymore.  My suggestion, do what I did....rent it, watch it once, and walk away.",1295049600,3,1122,4.414634146341464
4246354,4,B0041SI7ES,"Any list of top 50 anything is going to be insanely subjective.  Obviously that's the case with this DVD, and though I have several complaints I don't think they did a bad job.  You can't cram all the WWE greats into 50 spots.  I would have just made it an alphabetical listing instead of trying to rank them, but that's just me.

It's been said many times, and I agree, that Hogan and Flair are ridiculously low on this list.  My #1 complaint, though, is -- what the HELL is Batista even doing on this list?!?  I realize they have to put over the new guys, which is why I'm biting my tongue about John Cena being on here (thank you, WWE, for not putting him in the top 10!).  But there are like a zillion guys whose jock strap Batista couldn't carry.  The most glaring omission is Pedro Morales.  I also would have included Tito Santana, Don Muraco, Paul Orndorff, and/or Greg Valentine (I realize they were mid-carders, but they were better than 95% of WWE's current roster).  They probably should have made room for the Ultimate Warrior and the Honky Tonk Man too.  BATISTA?!?!  Sheesh.

I also can't bring myself to accept Shawn Michaels as the #1 superstar of all time, even though he's responsible for all the greatest WWE matches since 2002.  I just can't get past all the backstage issues from the '90s.  However, if you're going to insist on a top 10 without Hogan, Flair, or Sammartino (or ""Summartino,"" as his name is spelled on the DVD), this one's pretty damn good.  It's great to see a guy like Harley Race get some love.  Oh, and for those of you who were wondering why Benoit is not on the list -- did you sleep through 2007?

I remember the WWE put out a special magazine several years ago about the top 50 superstars, and it was a much better list.  Still, you have to give them props for trying.  For once I'm happy with the match selection, too -- very little overlap from previous releases.  Highlights for me were seeing Bret Hart's first WWE championship win and the six-man elimination match from 1987.  I always love to see the old matches from MSG.

I recommend this DVD without hesitation even though it's tainted by the inclusion of Batista.  (Oh, by the way, I didn't get a booklet either.  What the hell is up with that?)",1293926400,5,2251,4.431707317073171

I got the DVD but havn't watched it yet, I know Ric Flair isn't in the top ten either that pissed me off. He is probably the greatest wrestler that ever lived, but i understand why he wasn't in the top 5, he left for TNA really insulted Shawn Michaels, and probably insulted WWE in interviews. The top ten should have been Hulk Hogan(the reason WWE is still around and became so famous) Steve Austin(one of the main reasons WWF beat WCW) Ric Flair(best pro wrestler ever) Shawn Michaels(my personal favorite wrestler best wrestler at wrestlemania {yes undertaker I said it} the main event) Bret Hart (my childhood hero the best there is, best there was, best there ever will be and greatest technical wrestler I have ever had the honor to watch)

You gotta be kidding me....they left off so many great talents that should of been on there just to mention a few Dynamite Kid, Davey Boy Smith, Bam Bam Bigelow, Arn Anderson,Sting ( I know he never worked for the company but he deserves to be one of the top 50 of all time) Kevin Nash, Owen Hart, Scott Hall,Tully Blanchard.  I just can't believe their ranking systems...they need to take this off the market lol

I understand that Hogan and Flair are in TNA right now, but any top ten that doesn't have Hogan and Flair in the top tier is a joke.  I would not recommend purchasing this due to the ridiculous ranking.  Only buy it if you are interested in the match selections.  WWE intentionally made this to be controversial.  Now the reason for that is anyone's guess.

I personally enjoyed this DVD as a collector because there were a lot of matches that have never been released before.  The majority of the matches were very good with the exception of a couple duds.  The countdown may be the most controversial thing WWE has ever presented on DVD.  Although I don't agree with the line-up, I do think they did a great job on the presentation.  Each superstar had a featured 2-3 minute biography which was very nice.  It was a good watch for me but I would only recommend it to serious collectors.",1292544000,2,601,4.467889908256881

That said, did anyone else not get an insertion with the contents of each disc? I usually like to read along to know what match is on what disc but nothing was included with my copy. Is this the norm now or did I just get a bum copy?",1292544000,2,482,4.3076923076923075

Each list will be different, i'm sure the 15 year olds list would probably include Cena at the top. You cannot make a list, it's impossible. WWE made a list and people have a right to argue it because everyone has there own opinion. I really don't care who is on the list because I know several top wrestlers would be left off. The first dvd shows the list from 50 to 1, it takes less then two minutes to go over each wrestler. Nothing speical at all.

Disc 2 and 3 are matches. I applaud WWE for finally putting Hart's first title win onto dvd. I enjoyed disc 2 as it featured some good forgotten matches. Disc 3 started with Hart-Flair and while the rest of the dvd isn't that bad, it features short tv matches. Smackdown had some very good matches in there history but nothing really stood out. It would have been nice to see the entire Iron Man match between Angle-Lesnar.

Overall, I enjoyed this dvd for the matches. The biography is opinion and I really didn't let it bother me. I do recommend it due to matches alone.",1292284800,,1185,4.238938053097345

After viewing this product i really have to say what a dissapointment it really is. Vinces fingerprints are everywhere they say its a list made by wwe superstars but it might as well be the top 50 superstars as told by john cena since he gives his opinion on nearly every single superstar. Someone said the reason sting isn't on this set is because he never worked for vince well now after viewing it i see thats not even a argument since its a list of the top stars from all the promotions that vince owns thenrights to so its literally a snub. The entire list is a total joke from top to bottom. The matches are pretty much the worst selection ive ever seen the only reason i got it was for the hart flair match. I mean honestly who ever selected these matches should be fired i mean really the best match they could selest to showcase eddie guerreros skills was a smackdown match vs the big show?really?of all the 100s of classics eddie was in and thats the best one they could find?The big 8 man tag was ok for what it was but another example of a poor selectionsame for the fatal 4 way match way to short and couldve been other better matches to choose from. Overall im very very very dissapointed with this set wwe really dropped the ballon this set which isn't surprising since theyve had a series of lousy sets this year jericho,steamboat,cena, etc all of which wouldve been great except the cena one i mean really why does this idiot need another set the same for the shawn micheals set",1289779200,21,3743,4.7215384615384615

The WWE might not be the predominant wrestling organization today if not for Hogan's popularity. And, Sting not in the top 50? Preposterous.",1487462400,,302,4.716981132075472

This is typical childish Vince/WWE hating on anyone who's not on good terms with their company at the time, but this time they have taken it wayyyyy too far.  This DVD should LEGIT be taken off the shelves and anyone who buys it needs their head examined.",1421280000,,296,4.462962962962963

8413143,4,B0041SI7ES,"Without a doubt, one of the most controversial DVD sets of the year here as WWE comprised a list showcasing what they see as the Top 50 Superstars Of All Time. Now let me get this out of the way before anything else in that the selections for this set are really no different than their previous sets ranking superstars (Greatest Wrestling Stars Of 80's & 90's) in that it's always going to be controversial no matter who or how they rank the superstars because WWE will never come out with a list that pleases everyone because everyone has a different criteria & view along with the obvious case in that WWE will show a heavy bias towards talents that they created or are in their ""good graces"" against those who aren't for obvious reasons (such as the on-again/off-again relationship with Hulk Hogan who's currently TNA). Speaking of Hogan, he even said it himself that the list is nothing more than a ""work"" which at the end of the day, it is & you just can't take too seriously or think about too much because it is what it is with the fact being that the rankings on this list don't hold any relevance outside of this DVD set.

Now the documentary itself is hosted by Todd Grisham & has a short two min. profile for every 51 superstars (watch or read the list to see how they got that number) with various talents from the past & present giving comments on the wrestler with some of the comments being from old interviews & a few new ones. Throughout the presentation, you'll hear from: Paul ""The Butcher"" Vachon, Ronnie Garvin, John Cena, Gerald Brisco, William Regal, Jerry Lawler, Triple H, J.J. Dillion, Josh Matthews, Matt Striker, Dolph Ziggler, Kofi Kingston, Santino Marella, The Miz, Arnold Skalland, Antonio Anoki, Dory Funk Jr., Ted Dibiase Sr., Terry Funk, Shannon Moore, Gregory Helms, Chris Jericho, Edge, Jim Ross, Honky Tonk Man, Pat Patterson, Jim Brunzel, Christian, Michael Hayes, Gene Okerland, MLB star Wade Boggs, Ric Flair, Billy Kidman, H.D. Smith, Vince McMahon, Bobby Heenan, Ken Patera, Hulk Hogan, Ron Simmons, Jim Cornette, Fabulous Moolah, Joey Styles, Billy Graham, Ernie Ladd, Sgt. Slaughters, Stephanie McMahon, Mae Young, Sensational Sherri, M.V.P., Steve Williams, John Morrison, Steve Austin, Arn Anderson, Harley Race, The Destroyer, ex-NWA president Bob Geigel, Rey Mysterio, Michael Cole, George Steel, ex-NWA referee Tommy Young, Greg Valentine, Roddy Piper, Bruce Prichard, Blackjack Lanza, Rocky Johnson, and Vince McMahon Sr.

Matches Include:
WWE Womens Champion Fabulous Moolah vs. Susan Green - This was one of those matches that showcases how Moolah was able to sell & make her opposition look good as Moolah was on the defense for most of the bout. Green has a superior height different over Moolah & used it to her advantage with moves like Andre The Giant's body scissors into a ""hot seat"" atomic drop while Moolah had to cheat to get an advantage & take advantage of Green missing a critical move to get the win.
""MSG"" June '75

Gorilla Monsoon confronts Muhammed Ali - This was one of the two most famous incidents linked to Monsoon's career as we saw what happened when Ali decided to step into the ring against Gorilla after a match leading to something we didn't usually see...""The Greatest"" on his back & leaving the ring after he had enough.
June '76

Boxing Match: Andre The Giant vs. Gorilla Monsoon - ""Gorilla Monsoon is the only man in the world to have wrestled Muhammed Ali & box Andre The Giant"" is the phrase that highlights Gorilla's two most famous moments in his career & you get the second half of that statement here. The the video quality isn't real clear & the ""match"" itself isn't anything special past a few chuckles at watching how Monsoon was knocked out...twice.
Sept. '77
[Andre The Giant]

WWWF Champion Billy Graham vs. Dusty Rhodes - This was the beginning of a series of battles between two of the most charismatic wrestlers at that time. Dusty just knew knew how to work the crowd and had them hot for every single thing he did while Graham tried to ground Dusty with headlocks & bear hugs. This was a good start to a classic series.
""MSG"" Sept. '77
[The American Dream: The Dusty Rhodes Story]

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Iron Sheik - Before the match, you get a classic Iron Sheik ""Iran #1"" rant from him on the microphone. With the exception of a few punches & kicks, this was a complete dominate performance by Hogan from the minute he hit the ring to ending the year the same way he began it, dominating the Sheik for the WWE Championship.
""MSG"" Dec. '84

Elimination Match: Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage, Harley Race, Adrian Adonis - This match was significant for a matter of reasons in that this was a WrestleMania III preview as the participants in the top 3 undercard matches went against each other here & this was Roddy Piper's last appearance in MSG before his retirement. It should also be noted that the manager Slick was on commentary for this match leading to some funny heelish comments towards Junkyard Dog. This was a fun six man tag that kept getting out of control with so many men getting involved leading to a double count out at one point between two participants but I was personally happy to see who the final participants were because it was a ""dream match"" I've always wanted to see but never knew it happened until now.
""MSG"" Feb. '87

Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude - Almost 5 years before their more memorable series of matches in WCW series, they met here in what could come off more as a preview for those later encounters. This was a match that had it's good mix of technical wrestling such as Steamboat heavily working over Rude's arm. The pace picked up over time & towards the end had so many near falls that were just so close with Bobby Heenan making his presence felt from time to time including after the match.""MSG"" Dec. '87

AWA Champion Jerry Lawler vs. Curt Hennig - This isn't the famous match where Lawler beat Hennig for the AWA Title in Memphis but a rematch with Curt Hennig having Madusa (Alundra Blayze in WWE) in his corner. This was a nice match between the two with Lawler always having a limited offense but knew how to work with what he had while Curt worked over Lawler for most of the match & even resorted to dirty tactics like using Madusa's shoe at one point. Again, it was a nice match.
""AWA"" Aug. '88

No Disqualification Match: Jake Roberts vs. Ted DiBiase - Along with the ""No DQ"" rule, Virgil was also banned from ringside for this match. Despite the fact that this was a No DQ match, they still wrestled a very technical match without having to resort to bending the rules to the point where the No DQ rule was almost unnecessary. Great storytelling here by both men with Jake Roberts working over Ted's arm with armbars & kneedrops while Dibiase applied moves like a swinging neckbreaker & piledriver to work over Roberts' previously injured neck.
""MSG"" Dec. '89

WWE Champion Ric Flair vs. Bret Hart - This was probably the most requested match that WWE had yet to release onto a DVD set but you finally get it here. Don't know what else what to say except you got what you expected from these two in that it was a great technical match that went back & forth between both men who both worked over the legs including both men using a figure four at one point. For those who saw Bret Hart's DVD, keep in mind that is a part in this match were Bret dislocates his finger only for him to pop it back in place with Mr. Perfect giving a look saying ""UGH, that was nasty."" Bottom line, a lost classic that finally made it's way to a DVD set.
Oct. '92

Empty Arena Match: WWE Champion The Rock vs. Mankind - This was Mankind's title rematch from the ""I Quit"" match at the Royal Rumble a week earlier & was a halftime special during the Super Bowl. This was the first ever Empty Arena match in WWF history and is a glorified ""Falls Count Anywhere"" match as it should also be noted that Vince McMahon did the commentary for this match. For those who saw any of their matches from this feud knows exactly what to expect here as you had entertaining moments from The Rock's taunts (even throwing Mr. Socko in a kitchen oven, taking phone calls & coming onto a woman in the middle of the fight) to Mankind being his usual ""goofy"" comedic self at times to the point where he lost one of his boots. But more importantly as you would expect from a ""falls count anywhere match"", they went anywhere & everywhere from with hardcore brawling...ringside area, the arena seats, the kitchen, catering area, the outside loading dock, and even a private office using anything they can get their hands on in the process including a couple of things that would bring a new meaning to the term ""food fight."" This was one of the most entertaining matches that you'll ever see in your life.
""Halftime Heat"" Jan. '99
[Mick Foley: Hard Knocks & Cheap Pops]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. The Undertaker - This took place before the Armageddon PPV that would see all four of these men participate in the only 6 man Hell In A Cell match. On the previous RAW, Kurt Angle formed an alliance with Triple H & Rikishi to take out Austin & Taker & Rock so Kurt was singled out by all three right from the start before it eventually broke down into every man for himself with everyone involved having a confrontation at one point before the other two members of the upcoming Cell match made their presence known but it was a fun TV match for what it was.
""SmackDown"" Dec. '00

Undertaker & Kane & Hardy Boyz vs. Steve Austin, Triple H, Edge, Christian - This happened the week before the Backlash PPV with all the members of both teams having issues with members of the other teams in some way, shape, or form within the past month or more and it should be noted as well that this was early into the notorious ""heel"" Austin run of 2001. I don't know how else to describe or describe this match as anything else but a wild brawl as the action wasn't able to be contained most of the time with everyone fighting in the ring or on the floor with the action starting off hot & never slowing down with the main story here of how Kane's injured arm continued to be worked on & punished throughout the match.
""RAW"" April 01

Edge & Triple H vs. Kurt Angle & Chris Jericho - This was a preview of the upcoming Judgment Day PPV with the underline story being the underline friction between Triple H & Edge. This was a match full of non-stop action with both teams actually working well together with some standout moments like how one feud ended up in into a fight through the crowd while another one in this match took a hard chair shot to the face. This was a fun TV tag match.
""SmackDown"" May 02

Eddie Guerrero vs. Big Show - As eluded to my the announce team, this was a rematch from No Mercy months earlier & Eddie still looking for revenge for Big Show tossing him through a windshield of a low rider before that event with Show adding an extra incentive for himself stating that he would quit if he lost. Show dominated early with his heavy showcasing of power even catching Eddie in midair off the top rope while attempting to punish his arm. Eddie was able to use his speed against Show & even doing a bit of his ""lie, cheat, steal"" tactics with a ringside wrench & even catching Big Show with a DDT from the top rope. This was a good main event for TV.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '04

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton - P.O.D. performed Rey Mysterio to the ring as Orton attacked Kurt with the belt right from the start with Angle responding with not only a german suplex on Orton but another one on him & Mysterio at the same time before giving an assist to Rey lifting him up in the air for a top rope frankensteiner allowing Rey to take control as he was able to roll through a sunset flip attempt into a knockout kick followed by a head scissor takeover however Angle was able to counter an attempted 6-1-9 attempt into the anklelock & later catching Orton in the anklelock with the referee distracted both times as he kept deliver impactful german suplexes & an Angle Slam that sent one challenger over the top rope only for each man to come back with a big move from Orton's RKO to Angle's top rope belly to belly suplex & Rey delivering a 6-1-9 around the ring post before it came down to come man being able to ""divide & conquer"" long enough to get the victory. This was what a triple threat was designed to be in that it was non-stop action from all three men delivering one big move after another with each man looking like they had a chance but the major downfall of this (depending on how you want to look at it) is that this match was under 10 minutes when you would expect more from a World Championship match at WrestleMania.
WrestleMania 22
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man]

John Cena & Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker & Batista - This match was set under very unique circumstances in that both tag teams were comprised of a champion & his challenger for the upcoming WrestleMania while Michaels & Cena were also the current World Tag Team Champions as well. We all know that we can depend on Undertaker & HBK to give us a match of the night while Cena & Batista have bad reputations for being champions ""who can't wrestle"" but I'll go on record as to say that I wouldn't call this a lost classic but definitely delivered a quality performance from all men involved with Cena & Batista stepping up their game to keep up with the veterans including Cena doing such moves as a leg drop for the top rope & his old ""throwback."" Again, a great tag team match that was often forgotten about until now.
No Way Out 07

World Champion Edge vs. Undertaker - Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually delivers...and this was no exception. Edge worked on Taker's back throughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose. Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (Devil's Gate).
WrestleMania XXIV

Other matches feature 3 NWA Championship matches including Lou Thesz vs. Argentina Rocca, Harley Race vs. Terry Funk, and Jack Brisco vs. Dory Funk Jr. (the last two were joined in progress). In the end, I already gave my feelings on the ""rankings"" of this list but I was just happy to see profiles & comments on certain wrestlers that you don't really hear about much anymore (Killer Kowalski, Georgous George, Lou Thesz, Bruno Sammartino, Freddie Blassie) along with some of my past favorites (Ted Dibiase Sr., Rick Rude, Jake Roberts, Terry Funk). The matches were a real highlight here too as we didn't get any repeats from recent sets while also getting some lost classics (FINALLY! Bret's first championship win), forgotten matches (like Piper vs. Savage in the six man tag), & rare moments from their vault (Monsoon vs. Ali) which is always welcomed. Overall, I liked the presentation they gave us & the rare matches that were fun to watch for the most part so overall if you can get past the entire ""rankings"" then this is something I would recommend for a viewing.",1403568000,,15501,4.5253390435403285
