6993635,1,B00SWFMBNE,"The other review must have been written by someone involved with this movie.  This looks like it was made by a high school drama class, but the acting wasn't good enough to really consider that.  Laughable special effects, the aliens foot looks like a ski boot with moss on it.  The cgi was bad, the alien appears to be inches off the ground as it walks into the room.  Why is male genitals referred to as a worm but they know the f word?  What a waste of money and time, nothing ever made any sense, shoulda turned it off after the first 5 minutes.",1429401600,13,549,4.190476190476191
6993636,5,B00SWFMBNE,"I have to confess I had never heard of EXILE prior to finding it in my mailbox.  But I'm certainly glad the fine folks at Midnight Releasing saw fit to share it with me!  Although the title might sound vague, the plot of this science fiction thriller is far from it.  And despite the fact this is a low budget film, you could never tell it, thanks to a talented production team.  Overall, EXILE is an excellent film, and I highly recommend it.

I am so impressed with this film, from all aspects.  It is not perfect, but it's very close.  I have not been this impressed with an indie production in a long time.

EXILE is shot well and looks great onscreen.  This feels odd to state, given the fact that the locales are all desert dwellings that look like something you would find at the city dump.  But it works for the film, and even helps to promote a sense of credibility for it.

The acting in EXILE is also impressive.  The entire cast does a great job, especially those actors and actresses portraying the naive teenagers.  I had no trouble believing their performances.  I also enjoyed the voiceover by actress Dennice Cisneros, who plays the voice of The Angel.  Cisneros is a talented vocalist, and I look forward to more of her work in the future.

The special effects are excellent, especially for a low budget film.  The alien CG is sharp and does not look like an Atari 2600 game from 1983.  Likewise, the gore is great, and there's quite a bit of it.  This film is a testament to how small funds do not have to equal cheap quality.

If I were forced to find a flaw with EXILE, I don't think I could.  The film starts off with a bang, and it never lets you go.  I was enthralled the entire time.  Although it's not really a horror film, it will still appeal to gore-hounds and anyone looking for an original concept.  I recommend giving EXILE a look.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1428537600,4,1909,4.339943342776204
6993637,4,B00SWFMBNE,"This film is original, dark, and intelligently scripted. Its an imaginative change from standard post-apocalyptic sci-fi. Ignore people who cant give a low-budget indie film a chance. It reminds me a bit of A Boy and His Dog (1975) but instead of dark humor, they went creepier and gorier.",1492732800,3,289,4.918367346938775

6993639,3,B00SWFMBNE,"This movie is better than the reviews would suggest. Almost more of a horror movie than sci-fi. Ugly and dirty, it can be frighteningly realistic. It seems to ask the question, in a land of ignorance, dysfunction, and emotional cripples, can the human spirit overcome a malignant entity? It actually has far more to say than Alien, etc. though on a tiny budget. Takes a while to get going and then you will find it riveting.",1489968000,3,424,4.592105263157895

6993641,4,B00SWFMBNE,"I liked this flick. It's a competently made low budget indie movie, and has some decent acting. In my opinion it's in the upper half of any sci fi here on prime, there is so much formulaic crap. I was almost put off by the idea that it was another stupid apocalypse movie...it is not. Well,not in the usual sense, though the Angel is definitely a local apocalypse.

It's not action filled but it is creepy, decent writing, competent ending. The better than most for a good B movie gets it four stars. I like surprises and this is a lil gem in the rough.",1488153600,5,553,4.266666666666667
6993642,5,B00SWFMBNE,"Not for the average mans' taste, faint of heart, or group thinker who don't know fine cossacks from cheap beer. This film challenges the status quo for the transhumanist with its originality, evaluating and contemplating the meaning of life, emptiness, and being ""complete,"" with its own spark of voice. This director does not try to impress with another superficial star wars junk scifi, but has the stomach to courageously bring a story without apologies. Refreshing to see small film makers have the backbone to go against audience's expectations for another Hollywood junk- for it composes oneself with the element, intrigue with the innocence of the protagonists, the antagonist as  the covert operative oppressing and feeding off man as an alien ""benefactor/ godhead"".  Which brings to mind: the Smithsonian accounts of incursion from malevolent extraterrestrial angels, mentioned in ancient sandscripts from all over the world. I found this film very amusingly entertaining. I give it a 5/5 stars for its boldness, and modestly suggesting what religion is: oppression; whereby life is hope to wholeness.

6993663,4,B00SWFMBNE,"Hey people, you'll have to actually watch this movie all the way through to really understand and appreciate this gem. All the people in this dead community have been implanted with some sort of alien being, but they either don't realize it, or they're buying into the rhetoric the Angel/alien has been spouting for 10 years.  Everyone seems dumb, almost retarded, but that's because the Angel tells them things that put them under its control.  Example:  females found guilty of starting ""war"" are sentenced to ""murder"". Actually they are pregnant.  The boys are calling it pregant, because they probably don't remember anyone having any babies.  The Angel/alien wants to be the only ""mother"" here.

This really is not a stupid movie -- it's actually pretty damn smart to write a believable script where society has been so twisted that it's become alien on Earth.  The actor who plays David has been in a few movies I've seen, and he does a really good job as a teenager who is growing and breaking free of the laws holding him down.",1481241600,2,1035,4.748603351955308

I turn off most B-movies in a few minutes because the photography and writing are so uninspired but Exile was very artistic and created a strong aesthetic impression. The use of squalor was effective in conveying a kind of horror, and the bodily corruption by the alien was simply horrific.
I prefer movies that are artistic to those that are simply competent, and the technical shortcoming of this film I can overlook because the world created by the filmmakers is absorbing enough to make me want to get grossed out.
It's a technically flawed film (what isn't?) and an artistic success because of the good writing, direction, photography and sincere acting. No attempt at anything remotely Hollywood - yay!",1475712000,6,787,4.924812030075188

6993675,3,B00SWFMBNE,"You should probably ignore the highest AND lowest reviews. I don't think its as deep as the pretentious five star crowd wants it to be. Anything low budget or containing elements of art house will have them looking for whats not even there. On the other side, the one and two stars are mostly from people who didn't even finish the movie. Which i can understand. Its pretty low budget. Acting is pretty awful. However that doesnt automatically make it bad. Most people just cant handle low budget. Thats fine. Im usually one of them! Especially after reading the five star reviews. I thought i was in for a huge fail disguised as pretentious art house garbage. This one is a rare exception though. If there is some higher metaphorical purpose to this, its fully optional. If you want to insist its deep, im sure there is plenty to dig for. However if you just want a simple, yet eerie and possibly disturbing story, it works on that level as well. I think its a shame personally. This is a good story, and would easily transition to work with a serious budget. I think it may have fallen victim to a narcissistic writer and director, who didn't want to consider making compromises. Which i don't think would even be an issue with such a lanier story. Direction is my biggest issue with this. Actors are tools for a director. For most of the acting to be this big of a fail, its bad direction at fault. I would love to see this picked up and redone by a legitimate studio. Overall, if you can handle low budget, and bad direction, within a good story, check it out. IF its free for you! Dont pay for this under any circumstances though.",1474156800,3,1635,4.453333333333333

There isn't a lot of special effects but what they have is good. I don't need the latest star trek special effects. This is low budget. The acting should have a fluid dialogue. An example of the opposite is like a conversation on a ham radio. Over. Copy that? Over. There's a pause for the other person to go. Occasionally this movie has that- slight pause for the next person to do their lines. It either eventually stops, or you get used to it.

NOT 'so bad it's funny'; so don't try entertaining your friends with it - but if you have a best friend and you both appreciate film, this is definitely worth the watch.
Sets up as a tragedy and ends up entirely rewarding, if somewhat graphic. The dreamlike content was a joy. The characters lovable and hate-able. If you want to escape to a weird world rife with dead-on metaphorical accuracy put this on immediately.

6993734,4,B00SWFMBNE,"I'm adding a few words, only because this movie has inexplicably, and undeservedly, low ratings; and because at least two of the top rated reviews are willfully bad, written by the fairly useless type of reviewer who believes a review is the place to play Mystery Science Theater, because, hahaha.

First, this is a science fiction movie, and only horror in the same vein that Carpenter's The Thing is. It's about an alien parasitic life form taking over a desolate desert town by infecting and zombie-fying the adults, while keeping the children around to replace the adults once the now more limited life span of their human bodies expires. The life cycle of the parasite is extremely disturbing, with at least 3 stages shown, and satisfyingly complete - no 'let the audience guess.' It involves telepathic connection to its drones, which allows the drones, on the other hand, to get glimpses of the alien's home planet, which was a nice touch.

As others have said, it's all wrapped into religious language - the alien keeping check on things by declaring itself 'an angel', and turning zombie is 'being blessed.' If you're into hidden meanings, the movie can be seen as criticizing cults, or fundamentalist religious groups. But it works well without turning to that interpretation too, if this is not your thing.

I've read a lot of allusions to the script being either bad or incomplete, which simply isn't true. Half the village's population are zombies (who talk with a metallic sound to the voice, so, duh, the review complaining about a metallic sound - that's a plot point, dude...), and the other half adolescents who grew up without parents, and were consciously kept at a mental age of 8 maybe (no one even understands the concept of pregnancy). That obviously has an impact on dialogue, as it should...which was very serviceable given this background, and delivered well and appropriate to this setting. I particularly appreciated the lead's temper tantrums as an about 18 year old.

The creature effects and frequent horrifying gore moments (the human bodies of the drone-zombies degenerate) are pretty good - definitely way more than adequate. 'The Garden' in particular is just awesome - both what it is, and how it's presented. It's a bit slow-moving, but so manages to flesh out several characters well; and it's never long until the next terrifying idea.

If you're into scifi (I mean scifi - not Star Trek or Star Wars (which I like too, but which aren't really scifi)), you will probably enjoy Exile. It seems to be about a crash-landed alien...however, and as the script is logical almost throughout in other respects, you might disapprove of an electric fence surrounding Sunderland (the town this plays in) which the alien could almost certainly not have built; no trace of its crashed starship either throughout. For an interesting final thought, note that the movie's original title was ""The Sunderland Experiment,"" and so....(which also makes me believe that the original ending must have been an extreme downer).",1455148800,12,3042,4.992110453648915

If you know the Merry Prankster, you are either on the bus or off the bus, there was no acceptable middle ground for you to occupy.

With no narrative over voice dialog or expositional text to explain, everything was delivered through the actions on screen. And it did it pretty effective. What I saw, an outlying settlement had been corralled into a breeding stock by a sophisticated off-world being. It was refreshing to see an alien being as being very alien from anything else on this planet. My thought it was stuck here through some unfortunate circumstance, after evaluating the indigenous species, it made an effort at colonizing.

While they state that no animals were harmed in the making of this - I am concerned that the film crew did not pick-up all of the litter that was used as backdrop/props in this film. The amount of trash on the set is almost a metaphor with today's issues related to environmentalism, immigration, and terrorism. It's just a sad state of affairs.

The movie was the cinematic equivalent of a multi-car train wreck: I could not look away even though it wasn't even funny-bad so I could MST3K my way through it.

However, it deserves one single star for what it could have been. The concept was interesting--that's why I chose to watch it. The monster wasn't half bad, mostly because we only got glimpses of it up until the climactic scene. Then it was ""Oh, that's it? Yawn."" The $1.98 budget is what ruined what could have been a terrific, freaky SF scene. The quick, poorly-lit moments when we get a glimpse of what's happening in the garden are completely ruined by lack of funds and possibly lack of skill to make the audience ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" like at fireworks (or hide under the bed, depending on one's tolerance for creepiness).

It just happens to be framed by a nightmarish, H.P. Lovecraftian form of first contact and the dichotomy of life inside a cult. Exile gives a relatable, recognizable premise and brings it into a hellish reality that is beautifully disturbing and effective. The acting is pretty tight on all fronts, the cast are completely immersed in their characters, the script is evenly paced with chilling moments of horror and emotional segments of life of the children that fall through the cracks.

The story moves with a somber beat of loss, despair that develops into determination and self preservation. Not to mention all the real world subtext symbolism that permeates this film. The direction Petke takes by keeping the style organic, and personal creates a deeply moving and unsettling reality for the characters. The horror elements, and there are some awesome, dark, gory horror moments in Exile, stay practical and visceral. There is some CGI blood added during interactions with the Angel, but during the more dramatic scenes between the characters which end in horrific displays of Lovecraft inspired nightmares, the effects and blood are practical ones. The soundtrack, sound effects used on Exile blend eerie instrumental sounds of sorrow and loss with added sound effects that are chilling. Together the sounds create a tense atmosphere of suspense that just elevates the emotional and dramatic struggle of the characters.",1431216000,,1590,5.186770428015564
6993901,2,B00SWFMBNE,"Directors Adam Petke and Sean Blau's 2015 feature ""Exile"" brings the topic of religious fanaticism to unique extremes by utilizing within the framework of a story of an alien who comes to the anarchic town of Sunderland and slowly takes over the people by ""blessing them"" and offering them the promise of death or eternal life. It starts out by possessing the adults and is trying to transform the children. The extraterrestrial entity also acts as judge of the the land (further proof of the never heavy handed symbolism along with the concept of ""blessing them"") by sentencing many of the residents of the town to 'murder for the act of murder'.

  It's a bold idea that appears to have been well mulled over in the tale's conception and subtly addressed in the overall fair, often hit and miss like the movie itself, screenplay (it's there for people looking for it but not so prevalent that it takes away from the story and becomes heavy handed) which drips with predictable, witless banter, but the film falls victim to many of the trappings of so many low budget Science-fiction films before it.

  The proof of this could be found in the many plot serving characters, all anarchist cinema archetypes, whose ambitions and motivations exist no more than to move the plot forward. Much of the first half is filled with a staginess about the mostly poor performances, all rather common for independent features, and we are treated to dingy, obviously cheaply done cinematography and another facet of these types of offerings: most of it keeps us in a single setting and really gives us hardly anyone to root for.

  Once we hit the forty-five minute mark of this feature's scant 83 minute length it finds its creative footing and becomes the movie it seemed as if it was trying to be all along. The pace picks up, the ideas click into pace to generate much more interest and become more prevalent and it satisfies more as a Horror film than the preachy Drama it was beforehand as it delivers impressive gore effects and the symbolism becomes even more challenging and courageous. It's not enough to save this film but it does give it some redeeming value which almost makes it a mediocre watch.

  To its credit, the alien effects are also well-done in the 1980's creature feature way that the look of the beast mirrors. At least it isn't the obvious, cartoonish computer generated imagery we see in so many high budget mainstream films. That sounds like a slight but it is high praise in a day in age where the creature is better left not shown at all because of this, or only in quick shots as it is here, and it makes us only think of what a rarity this semi-grindhouse, end of days concoction could've been had the first half worked better.

  The directing is standard point and shoot and the intensity never really builds to satisfying amounts. It does care more than the average genre offering about its characters and that is surely worth note. Still they aren't developed to be distinctly their own personalities and that also sinks the movie. As mentioned beforehand, they are only meant to keep the plot going and as the movie goes along it becomes increasingly obvious.

 This is one of the prime reasons ""Exile"" isn't wholly fulfilling and doesn't work as well as the filmmakers wanted it to. It has many noble facets to its credit but takes too long getting going, isn't believably acted and falls prey to the limitations of its budget. Still there is enough here to keep on eye on directors Petke and Blau and hope that they are given enough room to breathe and create the satisfying, and wholly unique, entity they were attempting with this endeavor. As it is, ""Exile"" has the spirit, the promise of a worthwhile endeavor but not the means to really fulfill its promise and, in so doing, becomes mostly forgettable.",1430870400,8,3834,4.690014903129657

Most of what people have called bad acting is actually there as part of the characters or plot.

This is a very strange, crazy, but satisfying movie about how the alien parasite is attempting to control the community & phase out human beings. There are many nice touches & just crazy scenes to make up for the lack of Hollywood stunts & CGI.  All in all, it's a creepy, strange, & originally bizarre Sci Fi flick that will make you say... ""WHAT THE $@#?"" More than once :).",1495584000,2,1163,4.599033816425121

Basically, an alien posing as an angel is manipulating a bunch of human parasite hosts/meatpuppets and raising a group of ""children"" {teens with a strange mix of advanced scientific education and the mental age of a 10 year old) who will eventually be parasite hosts, themselves,  The alien has kept these people prisoner for an unknown number of years behind an electric fence in the desert with only very limited contact with the outside world for supplies.  The humans have the choice of being ""Blessed"" with a parasite and being controlled by the alien and eventually mutating, or being ""Fallen"" and sent into an even more desolate part of the desert within the electric fence to live like animals among the garbage with occasional food drops.  The Alien maintains a strict sort of justice, and may pronounce guilt and punishment at any time.  Due to the extreme ignorance of the kids, they quickly discover sex without necessarily knowing what it is.  The alien is on constant lookout for pregnancy, which is considered an act of ""war"" and punishes motherhood with death.  One of the kids suffers through a personal battle between his loyalty to the mother alien/angel and a hatred and loathing for the transformation he is expected to embrace.  Ultimately, he opts to resist and the battle begins.

This movie was very strange, very disturbing, and very gross.  The method of infection was disgusting and seemed like something out of a Hentai movie.  The special effects ranged from OK CG to corny costumes, but they made it work.  Also, the strange behavior of the infected parents was great, especially when they ""planted"" themselves in the late stages of the infection.  I respect the hard work the filmmakers did to make a decent scifi movie on a small budget.  They told a cool story.  The plot was not predictable in the first 5 minutes.  The alien was strange and the infected were creepy.  I liked it and I will have a blast showing it to my buddy late some night over pizza and beer.",1492992000,6,2230,4.733160621761658
