8734688,5,B015UDEMJQ,"Great little series with a ton of cute dialogue and jokes between characters. Tamako is as ditzy as they come but remains completely adorable throughout. The guy next door (Mochizo) is the typical, WAY TOO SHY, male MC and mostly drove me nuts. I can't get my head around why most manga / anime creators still find that to be endearing or remotely popular because it gets tiring watching them suffer through trying to talk to a girl...it's never that hard. Nevertheless, it's a really good series, funny and feel good. Can't wait to watch Tamako Love Story to cap it off...already own it - just haven't watched yet. :-)",1510704000,2,619,4.636363636363637
8734689,4,B015UDEMJQ,Tamako Market is a great story where a girl encounters a strange talking bird.  She lives with her family in a small market in town.  This story provides some great slice-of-life mixed with comedy and a little bit of high school and middle school romance.,1482796800,4,255,4.644444444444445
