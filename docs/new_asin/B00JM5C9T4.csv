6381527,5,B00JM5C9T4,"I'm surprised by the couple of negative (P)reviews on here. One person claims the only reason to get it is the Flair-Nikita NWA World title tilt from the inaugural Bash in 1985. While that match is very good (it's always fun to see Flair in his prime, in this case carrying the promising but still green Koloff to a terrific main event), it's far from the only highlight. I'm sure the reasoning is because of the fact that most everything else included has been released on other WWE compilations (in some cases, more than once). But that's no reason to beg off; set in the appropriate context, there are enough incredible matches here to jump on board.
  My favorite stuff is from the NWA days. From Dusty winning the NWA belt from Flair in '86, to the first Wargames bout the next year, to a couple of doozies from the card that many people still consider the best wrestling PPV of all time (the '89 Bash): Sting vs The Great Muta, and especially Ric Flair's World title defense against the amazing, ageless Terry Funk. You also get Sting's very first World title win, over Flair, from 1990.
  One of the best, and most brutal, matches on the set is from 1992. At the time, people were shocked at Big Van Vader's clean win over Sting to capture the WCW belt, but after seeing it, you wonder how anybody could ever beat the monstrous, talented Vader...even considering the whole thing is booked ahead of time! He was that dominant, and remains the best super heavyweight in wrestling history.
  If possible, be sure to opt for the Blu-Ray version, due to the always-great extras included. Among others, you get Flair's ""controversial"" win over Lex Luger in 1988, and a chain match pitting the Stinger against the recently unretired Nikita.",1405382400,,1740,4.651465798045603
6381528,2,B00JM5C9T4,"Sorry I cant get too excited for this set. The only reason to buy it is the Nikita Koloff vs Ric Flair match from the first Great American Bash on July 6th 1985. The other matches, especially from 1986 & 1987, have all been seen. There's tons of footage from 1986 that needs to be seen. The first card from the 86 Bash fron Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium had Ric Flair vs Road Warrior Hawk. How about some the best of 7 matches from Nikita Koloff & Magnum TA and the cage matches with Baby Doll included her partnering with The Road Warriors & The Rock N Roll Express. Did we need to see her with Magnum & Dusty. That match was on the original Bash 86 tape from Turner. 1987 had some great cards in Greensboro & Maryland. Nikita Koloff vs. Lex Luger for the US title, Jimmy Garvin vs. Ric Flair winner gets Precious. Come on Vince we know you're jealous of the NWA stop releasing the same stuff.",1405123200,,896,4.276470588235294
6381529,4,B00JM5C9T4,"Dusty Rhodes, the creator of this event, host this DVD set & it should be noted that despite WWE hosting their own annual PPV under the same name that this set is exclusive to the period that the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling hosted the event.  It should also be noted that Dusty Rhodes & Larry Zbyszko did the commentary for 3 matches (Flair/Nikita, Express/Andersons, Warriors/Sting & Luger) but openly admitted they were more focused on just having fun than giving any real personal insight into the match or information surrounding it while the commentary for the Dusty/Flair match was the same from Dusty's DVD with himself & Mike Graham & Steve Romero doing the commentating which was more informative.

Matches Include:
July '85: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Nikita Koloff - It should be noted that David Crockett was the special referee for this match while Nikita came into this match as one half of the Tag Team Champions with his uncle & partner Ivan Koloff in his corner & Ric Flair had a spectacular entrance via a helicopter. Nikita showcased of it superior power advantage early constantly shoving Flair down only for him to retaliate with a heavy amount of chops to the chest as they traded momentum getting more physical as time went on with both men pushing the limits of a disqualification causing the referee to get physically involved on more than one occasion before Nikita was finally able to take control using his strength advantage to not only constantly work over Flair in & outside of the ring to the point where he was bleeding but stop any attempted momentum dead in it's tracks only for things to start getting out of control with not only the referee being an innocent victim more than once but a fan taking matters into his own hands.

July '86: NWA Tag Team Champions Rock N' Roll Express vs. Arn & Ole Anderson - Not only did Arn Anderson come into this match also being the World Television Champion but the Andersons were also involved in the attack that broke Ricky Morton's nose weeks earlier. The Andersons attempted to maneuver the Express into their corner only for them to quickly escape each time & taking control with double dropkicks while also Ricky got revenge for the Andersons breaking his nose before the Andersons were finally able trap & singled out one member of the team heavily working him over in their corner singling out body parts while also taking advantage of the referee to break the rules whenever possible in what resulted as a good match between two evenly matched teams.

July '86: Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes - Both men attempted to play mind games with each other through trying to show the other man up before Dusty was able to keep staying one step ahead of Flair working him over & keeping him down before Flair was able to get the advantage heavily working over Dusty's leg & previously injured ankle as both men traded momentum using the cage various times resulting in both men heavily bleeding & constantly attacking the cut.

July '87: War Games Match - SuperPowers vs. Four Horsemen: Dusty Rhodes, Road Warriors, Nikita Koloff, Paul Ellering vs. Ric Flair, Lex Luger, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, J.J. Dillon - For those newer fans who have never seen a War Games match before, it's a match where two rings are back to back with a steel cage surrounding both rings with a caged top. The match starts off with one member of each team in the ring fighting against each other for 5 minutes while a coin toss determines which team gets to send a wrestler in the match for a 2 minute ""2 on 1"" period and when that period is over, the other team sends in a wrestler to even the odds before the other team sends in another wrestler for a 2 minute period. The teams alternate back & forth until all members of each team are in the ring which is where ""The Match Beyond"" begins where the only way to win was either by submission or surrender. Various highlights including the starting period between Dusty & Arn with Anderson getting on hell of a low blow, Animal giving Tully Blanchard slingshots into take over & over & over again, Nikita Koloff getting back to back spike piledrivers directly onto his neck, the crowd being so loud that you honestly couldn't hear the commentary at times, Paul Ellering bring in a spiked wristband as a weapon, and the performance of J.J. Dillion in the match from the moment he came in & hit Hawk to when he was the victim of the Road Warriors Doomsday Device that left J.J. with an injury that he still feels to this very day. This was the very first War Games & it was certainly a violent match to just sit back & watch for it's time.
[War Games: WCW's Notorious Matches]

July '88: NWA Tag Team Champions Road Warriors vs. Sting & Lex Luger - It should be noted that this match didn't happen until later that year in November  despite this match being advertised as happening during the 1988 Bash tour.  The Warriors had recently turned their back on Sting leading to this match with Sting looking for revenge as him & Luger attacked the Warriors right away before the bell as both teams had a very similar styles of offense with the Road Warriors showing their power with various strikes along with being able to catch their opponents in mid-air while working their opponents over with double teaming while Sting & Luger were able to showcase their own strength along with athletic ability such as multiple dropkicks to the point where they kept sending the Warriors out of the ring as both teams traded momentum no selling each other's offense at some points before the action eventually started to get more aggressive both in & out of the ring in what was over all a good tag match between two evenly matched teams.

1989: NWA Television Champion Sting vs. The Great Muta - Muta came into this match with an undefeated record as Sting started this match off with a bang flying from one ring to the other with Muta being able to take control with his athleticism & martial arts ability constantly trying to slow the pace down with various submissions & going to the outside to break Sting's momentum as Sting's offense was fast paced & high impact both inside & outside of the ring. They would go on to have better quality & more high profile encounters but this was the start of a long term relationship between both men that would go on for over a decade.

1989: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Terry Funk - This was Flair's return to action since Funk piledrove him on top of a table months earlier with Flair showing that he was out for revenge by taking the fight to Funk right away brawling on the outside before Funk was able to regain control working over the neck area only for Flair to give receipts heavily working over Funk's neck with piledrivers causing Funk to resort to desperate tactics that caused Flair to be busted open continuing to target the neck area to the point where the referee had to be very forceful in pulling Funk back from the attack only for Flair to once again retaliate ""fighting fire with fire."" This was a fight between both men that came off exactly as how it was presented in that this was a grudge match that was only topped by the out of control wild brawl between both men & their associates who had unfinished business from earlier in the night.
[Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection]

1990: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Sting - This was the big return of Sting after his leg injury early in the year looking for revenge against the man who kicked him out of the Horsemen & had him get injured later that night. To insure a fair fight, Sting's group of friends called ""Dudes With Attitudes"" surrounded the ring to ensure the Horsemen wouldn't interfere while Ole Anderson was handcuffed on the rampway to El Gigante. Sting took the fight right to Flair & dominated him in the early going showing no signs of ring rust as Flair heavily targeted his knee so Sting kept coming back & fighting off Flair's attack.
[History Of The World Heavyweight Championship; WCW's Greatest Pay Per View Matches Vol. 1]

1990: Steiner Brothers vs. Fabulous Freebirds - The Freebirds attempted to get the early advantage attacking before the match with a divide & conquer strategy of keeping on man out of the while working over the other in the ring with double teaming before the Steiners were able to even the odds then used a different type of divide & conquer strategy that worked to their advantage dominating with their power & agility while using the Freebirds momentum against them causing the Freebirds to resort to illegal tactics such as double teaming & working over one man on the outside.

1992: Dustin Rhodes & Barry Windham vs. Steve Austin & Rick Rude - This was a quarter-final match in the tournament for the NWA Tag Team Championship while it should be noted that both Rude & Austin were not only members of the Dangerous Alliance but also individually the United States & Television champions while Windham & Rhodes defeated fellow Dangerous Alliance members Arn Anderson & Bobby Eaton in the opening round. The match started off with Austin & Windham renewing their rivalry against each other with going back & forth with Windham & Rhodes using a strategy that would have been expected from their opponents along with staying one step ahead countering & reversing their offense before the Alliance was able to single out one member of the team focusing on keeping him grounded as both teams traded momentum & were evenly matched with each team not having the advantage for very long taking high risk moves & frequent tags resulting in a very competitive match.

1992: WCW Champion Sting vs. Vader - It should be noted that Ron Simmons was watching the match with Tony Schavonie from the interview position while Sting came into this match with injured ribs courtesy of Vader months earlier. Vader was dominate early with his offense punching Sting down while easily catching & shoving him off whenever he attempted offense only for Sting to resort to playing Vader's game showcasing some power of his own to take Vader down & keep taking him down as they traded momentum with Vader working over the ribs & Sting continuing to play Vader's power game as it came down to one man capitalizing on another's mans misfortune.
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

1995: Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair - This years edition on the event took place on Father's Day as Flair had attacked Savage's father, Angelo Poffo, at the previous Slamboree event resulting in this match with Savage looking for revenge with his father at ringside. Savage started out intense from the start with pounding on Flair followed by clotheslines & a top rope double axe handle to the outside all within the opening minute as the fight got taken to the floor right away with both men taking advantage of the ringside environment with brawling tactics that resulted in one man being cut around the eye before Flair was able to heavily focus on Savage's knee while Savage showed his true intentions for this match.

1997: Falls Count Anywhere Match: Diamond Dallas Page vs. Randy Savage - It was during this time that Savage had joined the New World Order (nWo) and had a very personal feud with DDP leading to this return match months after the original match that left both men injured as this match started off wild & didn't let up as they used whatever they could get their hands on where ever it was from a chair & crutch in the ring to the steel steps at ringside to a waitress tray & flower pot at the V.I.P. picnic area along with any innocent bystander who got in the way or referee trying to take control of the match getting taken out in the process as well resulting in one of the best wild & craziest brawls during this era of WCW.
[Macho Madness: The Ultimate Randy Savage Collection]

1997: Ultimo Dragon vs. Psychosis - This was called a ""Respect Match"" as Psychosis was out to get revenge for his new manager Sonny Onoo due to Dragon firing him after costing him the Television Championship at the previous Slamboree event. Dragon was in control early on constantly taking Psychosis down & to the outside with rapid kicks & diverse offense only for Psychosis to keep being able to catch him in the middle of a high risk maneuver while Onoo got his shots in & be a distraction whenever possible along with using Dragon's own offense against him as both men traded momentum with high risk & impactful offense with signs of ""deja vu"" occurring but not in the way that one had intended.

1998: Chavo Guerrero vs. Eddie Guerrero - Chavo lost a match to Eddie months earlier resulting in him being Eddie's slave which Eddie heavily took advantage of finally causing Chavo to mentally snap & turn the tables on Eddie leading to this match here where Chavo's freedom was on the line. Eddie made it clear he didn't want to fight only for Chavo to force the issue & not letting up pounding on him or letting him walk away as Chavo was relentless in not just wrestling but fighting Eddie to the point where the referee had to physically pull him off at one point as it took Eddie using Chavo's own momentum against him while later resorting to such tactics like hiding behind the referee to get the advantage heavily focusing on his knee. This was a very intense match between both men & definitely Chavo's ""breakout"" match at that point in his career.

1998: WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match: Dean Malenko vs. Chris Jericho - The Crusierweight Championship was vacated days earlier on Thunder due to the controversy surrounding their match a month earlier at Slamboree leading to this match here to determine a new champion. Jericho started off in control but kept showing off whenever possible allowing Malenko to take control but acting out of character as he was very emotional punching & kicking Jericho down while pushing the limits of the referee's count along with punishing him with various stretches & submissions as they traded momentum with series of counters & reversals along with using their trademark submissions as each man was more focused on trying to either punish or embarrass the other ultimately resulting in one comment that took things too far.

1998: Roddy Piper & Randy Savage vs. Hollywood Hogan & Bret Hart - This match was history in the making based off the names alone as this was the first time that each participant had teamed up with their partner (at least on a televised event) with the special stipulation that both Savage & Piper agreed that they would have a match against each other immediately after this match. Savage & Piper showed that despite the tension between each other that they were on the same page within the opening minute as both men worked over Hogan together including using dirty tactics of their own such as eye pokes before Hogan & Hart were able to get back the advantage singling out one member while allowing the referee to be distracted in various ways before some miscommunication & smart tactics allowed the momentum to change before one man's injury ultimately lead to his teams downfall.

2000: Ambulance Match: Diamond Dallas Page vs. Mike Awesome - For those who haven't seen an Ambulance Match, the only way to win was to put your opponent into the back of an ambulance while there was a stretcher at ringside to assist in doing so. DDP was looking for revenge for Awesome throwing Kanyon off the top of the Ready To Rumble Cage the previous month at Slamboree while DDP brought Kanyon onto the stage area in a wheelchair & halo as him & Awesome started brawling to the point where the referee was knocked down in the opening seconds as the brawl got taken to the floor quickly before coming back into the ring with both men having a duel with steel chairs with Awesome taking advantage showing strength & athleticism while using various weapons while DDP was able to use Awesome's momentum against him to regain the advantage along with some help when another person with a vendetta against DDP attempted to get involved only to find out that there were more people with a vendetta of their own looking to making an impact themselves.

2000: WCW Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Kevin Nash - It should be noted that Jarrett was the crown jewel of the Eric Bischoff & Vince Russo's New Blood group while fellow member & commissioner The Cat made the announcement to have himself & members of the Filthy Animals as special officials & ringside attendants for this match. Nash was dominate early on including taking the fight to Jarrett in the crowd before Jarrett was able to focus on Nash's knee with weapons & various submissions along with having some assistance that Nash kept attempting to fight off while evening the odds with a weapon of his own as the action was getting out of control with the referees & anyone else trying to get involved in the match getting taken out in one way or another before one man decided to not only ""surprise"" one of the participants but the entire landscape of WCW in what turned out to be the final match in the history of the event from WCW.
[O.M.G. Volume 2: Top 50 Incidents In WCW History]

(Blu-Ray) July '86: Steel Cage Match: America's Team (Dusty Rhodes & Magnum T.A.) & Baby Doll vs. Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton & Dennis Condrey) & Jim Cornette - Cornette's bodyguard Big Bubba was on the outside of the cage with Baby Doll getting the first offensive move in the match that caused Cornette to attempt to climb out of the cage for safety with one man fighting off both members of the Express with Cornette getting his shots whenever possible only to keep running whenever Baby Doll got close to him with the numbers game eventually catching up to the point where he was bleeding from the cage & attacks coming off the top of the cage before things eventually broke down with not only Baby Doll finally getting her hands on Cornette but who was left laying after the match.

(Blu-Ray) 1988: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - Luger easily overpowered Flair through either tossing Flair around or powerful offense such as bearhugs & press slams wearing down Flair to the point where he was unable to capitalize on the occasions where Luger was down before finally being able to neutralize his power advantage by grounding Luger & working over his leg heavily which did show effects throughout the match as both men continued to trade momentum throughout the contest with ultimately an incident that occurred between both men weeks earlier coming back to haunt one of the competitors.
As a side note, the 1988 Great American Bash is now the first WCW PPV to have every match from the event released onto a DVD set with the inclusion of this match.

(Blu-Ray) 1991: Russian Chain Match: Sting vs. Nikita Koloff - This chain match was under the same rules as a Texas Bullrope or Leather Strap Match where you had to touch all four corners in a row without momentum being broken to win the match. Both men took the fight to the outside very quick with each man resorting to brawling tactics before the match was finally able to settle it down in the ring with both men using the chain in various ways as a weapon to either choke or make various strikes more impactful including one creative way it was used for a low blow with both men using similar tactics to either drag the other or break their momentum as this came off exactly as it meant to be, a grudge match.

(Blu-Ray) 1996: Kevin Greene & Steve McMichael vs. Ric Flair & Arn Anderson - Bobby Heenan came out of retirement to ""coach"" the Horsemen who had Woman & Ms. Elizabeth in their corners while Randy Savage was in the corner of McMichael & Greene along with their wives. The Horsemen showed their superior wrestling skills early on resulting in McMichael & Greene resorting to what they know how in various football tackles, taking their shots & delivering their own including their own offense against them, playing their own mind games & Savage taking shots on the outside to the point where even Anderson avoided tagging into the ring while the women on the outside were getting into their own arguments & Savage was fighting whoever he could get his hands on as both teams traded momentum using legal & illegal double team offense as it took the ""forth"" Horsemen to make all the difference.

(Blu-Ray) 1999: WCW Champion Kevin Nash vs. Randy Savage - Kevin Nash was coming into this match with injured ribs from earlier in the week as he took control working over Savage but hurting his own ribs in the process allowing Savage to work over that area both in & outside of the ring with his Team Madness valets getting in on the action as well on more than one occasion. This was definitely one of the worst main events in the history of the event because this match was relatively short & never left first gear with tons of interference from outside parties including possibly the most shocking return in WCW history considering the conditions he left under years earlier.

There are a few issues with this set in that with the way their Network is currently setup with every pay-per-view available that these type of ""best of PPV matches sets"" (just like the WCW themed one released only a few months ago) not as valuable as they once were meaning that it would have been more beneficial to see more non-PPV unreleased matches from the tour while the match selection will always be debatable as it's impossible to have a list that was meet everyone's standards but I feel that Rey Mysterio's debut against Dean Malenko from the 1996 edition should have had a place on here. In the end, this set does to justice to the original NWA/WCW editions of what was definitely their second longest ""big event"" concept behind Starrcade that I would recommend.",1404864000,5,21900,4.644645161290323

Overall: This seems like an awesome set that I will definitely be buying once it's released. One reason and probably the only reason you should buy this set is because it's strictly dedicated to the WCW's Great American Bash PPV. There are no WWE Great American Bash PPV matches on here, which I'm kind of happy about because it gives WCW more time in the spotlight and not to mention, WWE didn't have very many memorable matches at the Great American Bash. I'd give Eddie Guerrero vs JBL, Chavo Guerrero vs Rey Mysterio a pass, but I'm extremely happy to see matches such as Randy Savage vs DDP and Chavo vs Eddie make the list. So if you need a reason to buy this set, buy it because of all classic WCW gems you can find on it",1400544000,41,3817,4.672672672672673

A sign of the simpler days.  Although, this dvd left me lacking in a few areas.
I don't think the commentary with Dusty and Larry was very good at all, Id much rather have the original commentators.
Also, I hate when they change the entrance music.  They don't do that with the network, why do they do that with the DVDs?
Its horrible.

Also, I realize the Great American Bash is a WCW event, but there were some very good matches when the WWE starting putting in on as well.
They should have included.
2004 JBL beats Eddie for the WWE Championship in a bullrope match.
2005 Rey Mysterio vs Eddie, another classic
2006 King Booker beats Rey Rey for the title!
2007 John Cena defends the WWE title vs Bobby Lashley in what was one of the best matches of the year.
2008 HBK vs Jericho

1. The commentary on the oldest matches, especially that of Dusty Rhodes and Larry Zbyszko, is about the worst I've seen on any of these WWE DVDs. They didn't even try to put things in historical perspective or actually talk about the match. It took away some enjoyment from those older matches.

2. The insulting inclusion of Sting/Luger vs. Road Warriors. For one thing, it didn't happen in July 1988 at The Great American Bash. The match was at the Charlotte Coliseum, which opened that fall. Charlotte's Bash card was at Memorial Stadium that July. This match occurred the day after Thanksgiving - Nov 25, 1988. The Road Warriors came in as World Tag Team Champions, belts they had won in October. Don't get me wrong. I'm glad to have this match.

Dusty also does some new commentary with Larry Zbyszko on some of the earlier matches. There is no documentary which I think is great cause there is more room for matches. But there is not a lot of real back stories or interviews about each match for build-up which helps, sometimes the flow just feels like match after match. Dusty does some build-up but you feel like there needed to be more information about each match. But these are all really good matches since they are all from one of the best pay-per-view events ""The Great American Bash"". You also get the first WAR GAMES match in 1987 which began at ""The Great American Bash"" and later evolved into ""Fall Brawl"" another great WCW pay-per-view. Overall this is a 9 / 10 only because nothing can be perfect, but this is a great view for any Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Lex Luger, Randy Savage, Sting, Road Warriors, and basically all wrestling fans in general will like this Blu-ray.",1519776000,,1064,4.518134715025907

8652364,5,B00JM5C9T4,"So I finally got this set and thought it would be fun to review it.  First off, I was a huge fan of the GAB events held back in the day so it was fun for me to go back in time and relive some of these matches all over again.

The first match is from the first GAB and featured Ric Flair defending the world title against Nikita Koloff on 7/6/85.  It should be noted here that Flair wrestled mostly as a heel at the time so it was weird to see him as a babyface taking on the dreaded Russian Koloff.  It should also be noted that Dusty Rhodes and Larry Zbyszko were doing commentary (not that great might I add).  I was actually wondering if this would be the complete match because I honestly have never seen the full contest.  I have only seen the clipped match that was featured on the Ring Masters VHS tape that was released back in the 80's.  I was VERY surprised to see that it was the full match.  These two have had some great one's and this one may have been one of their best.  It was just a great back and forth match with Flair getting busted open at one point during the match.  Flair was able to win but he had to go through hell to get the win.  As a side note, check out Flair's awesome entrance to the ring.  It has to be seen to be believed.

The next match is from 7/26/86 and was a number one contender's match for the tag titles.  It featured the Rock n' Roll Express taking on Ole and Arn Anderson.  At this time, the GAB wasn't just one event, it was a tour that they did.  If I'm not mistaken this match have came off of the last show of the tour.  It was a classic.  I used to love Ricky Morton from the Rock n' Roll's and he did not disappoint.  I was not that big of a fan of Robert Gibson but he kind of turned it up here as well.  Of course, Ole and Arn were their old selves, cutting the ring off and just punishing the RR's.  Great match but it was a shame that it had to end in a 20 minute draw.  I would have liked to have seen a clear cut winner.

The next match is from the same event on the tour and featured Ric Flair defending his world title against Dusty Rhodes in a cage match.  I have to say that I am not a huge fan of the Dusty/Flair matches that they had over the years.  I liked their feud with each other but not the matches.  This match is a killer contest and may have been the best match of the series (I believe it won Match of the Year for PWI magazine).  This was just as emotional of a match that you could get.  The fans really wanted to see Dusty pull it out.  Dusty poured his heart into this match and was able to win the match and the title in a great and bloody contest.

The next match is from 7/4/87 and it featured a new kind of match.  That match was the War Games match and saw Ric Flair, Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, Lex Luger and JJ Dillion taking on Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, The Road Warriors and Paul Ellering.  Again, in 1987, the GAB was a tour and on this leg of the tour, the fans would get to see something they had never seen before.  It would be two rings surrounded by one giant cage that had a top on it.  The rules were simple:  Two men would start for five minutes and then there would be a coin toss.  Whoever won (always the heels) would send in another man making it a 2 on 1 match for 2 minutes.  After that, the losing team of the coin toss would send in a man making it 2 on 2 for two minutes.  It would alternate like that until all men were in the ring and then it would be submit or surrender.  The match would end when someone would quit.  This was a hell of a match.  It had so much action and blood that it wasn't even funny.  I don't know who was the most impressive but boy was it fun to watch.  This match is just fantastic!

The last match on disc 1 is from 1988 and features Sting and Lex Luger taking on the Road Warriors.  In 1988, the NWA did do a GAB PPV but they also went on tour and this match was from the tour.  I thought this match was going to be great but it turned out to be kind of a bore.  I'm not sure why it was so boring, maybe the pacing which was kind of slow, but I can't quite place my finger on it.  I think if it would have been a faster pace it may have been much better.

The first match on disc 2 was a TV title match between Sting and Great Muta from 1989.  This was a fantastic contest!  To me, this was one of their best contests.  It was so good from start to finish.  I didn't like the ending, which was a double pin draw, but the rest of the match was just fantastic!  This was probably my favorite match from the whole event that year.  I can't say enough good things about it.

The next match was also from 1989 and featured Ric Flair defending his world title against Terry Funk.  These two had one hell of feud that year and it all began with Flair winning the world title from Ricky Steamboat at Wrestle War and Terry attacking Flair and piledriving him through a table.  This match was intense from start to finish and did not let up.  The chops from Flair are some of the most intense I have ever heard.  Terry is his usual crazy self here.  The match ends on a sour note, via DQ, but it is still worth watching.

Up next is another world title match and features Ric Flair defending against Sting.  This is a fun match to watch.  No one thought Sting was going to be in this match because in February of the same year he had blown his knee out and wasn't expected to be back by July to take on Flair.  Well, he made it back and the rest is history.  This was the start to Sting's rise to become one of the biggest stars ever.  The match itself is a little one sided with Sting dominating most of the 16 minute contest.  Still, it is fun to watch Sting win his world title and have Flair pass the torch.

The next match is from the same event and had the Steiners taking on the Freebirds.  I'm not sure why this match didn't take place before the last match because the last match was the main event of 1990 but anyway it was a good contest.  It was a 13 minute classic from both teams.  I feel that the Michael Haynes/Jimmy Garvin version of the Freebirds doesn't get enough credit.  I thought they were good and in some ways they were slightly better than the Haynes/Gordy/Roberts version.  This was a great back and forth match though and was just fun to watch.

The next match is from 1992.  For some reason, the WWE chose not to put a match on from 1991 on the DVD set.  They did add a match from that GAB on the Blu Ray.  The match from 1992 that they chose was a tag match between Steve Austin and Rick Rude taking on Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham.  This was a quarter final match in a tournament match to crown new NWA world champs.  At this time the company was still WCW but the NWA was back and wanted to see their tag titles and world title defended on shows.  This match was killer and went for nearly 20:00.  I have always felt that Rhodes and Windham were a very underrated team.  They proved it here (and that night wrestling in 3 matches that went for a combined hour).  They were great and picked up a hard fought win.  They would go on to wrestle 2 more times that night, making it to the finals against Terry Gordy and Steve Williams (The Miracle/Violence Connection) but would lose as Gordy and Williams would leave the PPV as NWA and WCW tag champs (they had won the WCW tag titles from the Steiners a few nights before this event).  That finals match is the one I wish they would have chosen from the DVD set but it was still great to see the match that they did pick.

The next match was a world title match and featured Sting defending his world title against Vader.  This match was also from 1992 and it was a killer match.  Vader was so dominate here it wasn't even funny.  He threw Sting all over the ring and just brutalized him from the opening to the merciful final bell when he finally defeated Sting for his world title.  I remember as a kid watching this match and just being in a state of shock.  I had never see anyone man handle Sting like Vader did.  This is just an enjoyable match (as all of their matches were) to watch.  This would be the last GAB for a few years.

Ok, so the GAB took a hiatus for 3 years and returned in 1995.  The match that was chosen from that event was the main event match between Randy Savage and Ric Flair and was the first match of Disc 3.  These two had started feuding with each other in the WWE over the world title there and Miss Elizabeth.  In 1995, their feud would escalate as Flair helped to beat down Savage's father Angelo Poffo.  This was supposed to be Randy's night for revenge but not everything went according to plan.  Flair stayed one step ahead and was able to pick up the win in a barn burner of a match.  I have seen a lot of their matches and this 14 minute match may have been my favorite just because everyone and I mean everyone thought that Randy was going to win this thing but Flair just pulled out a shocker.  Great stuff.

The next part of Disc 3 wasn't a match but a segment from 1996.  The segment was when Hall and Nash showed up to see if anyone from WCW had accepted their challenge.  Eric Bischoff decided to interview them and he said that he would give them an answer.  I guess he didn't give it to them fast enough because they powerbombed his rear end straight off a stage and through a table.  I think what made the segment work was how real it got.  I mean it got really real (Bishcoff even asked if they worked for the WWF) and it was a great shocker as well.

The next match was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and DDP.  First off, this was a fantastic feud.  Their feud started with just a match at Spring Stampede where DDP picked up a surprise win and then Randy starts to provoke DDP with pictures of his wife Kim and that led to this match which was off the charts good.  These two never had a bad match and this one was definitely not a bad match.  This match was back and forth and a roller coaster of a contest.  I loved it.  It wasn't too violent but it was stellar.  Randy picked up the win here to tie the series up and after having a few other contests with each other (mostly tag matches) they would settle the score at Halloween Havoc in a Sudden Death match.  This match on this set though was great!

The next match was also from 1997 and it saw Ultimo Dragon taking on Psychosis.  This was a fantastic high flying contest and was actually the opener for GAB 1997.  It was a great way to start the show.  It was 14 minutes of high flying fast paced action.  I was a huge fan of Dragon and always had been since I saw him wrestle in Japan so it was fun to see him in this match and pick up the win.

The next 3 matches are all from 1998 and first up is Eddie Guerrero taking on his nephew Chavo Guerrero.  This is a long 14 minute match.  I say long because Eddie and Chavo, to me, never had any good chemistry with each other and their matches were usually long and boring and this one was no different.  It was a boring match that I never cared about.  The only good thing was the surprise ending which saw Chavo actually pick up the win.  The rest of the match is pretty forgettable.

The next match from 1998 is Chris Jericho taking on Dean Malenko for the vacant Cruiserweight title.  This was a far better match from the 1998 edition of GAB.  This was a fast paced match and was also a great wrestling match.  Dean was perhaps one of the best ""shooter"" style wrestlers I have ever seen and in this match he shows us just why that is.  It is a shame that the match ends in a DQ because it was so good up to that point but it is still worth viewing.

The final match from the 1998 edition of GAB was a tag team match that saw Hollywood Hogan team with Bret Hart to take on Roddy Piper and Randy Savage.  You know, 10 years or even 5 years prior to 1998 this would have been one hell of a match but in 1998 it was just an average match.  I wasn't into it all that much and I don't think most of the guys involved were into all that much into it either.  It was kind of an 11 minute bore but it was fun to see all these guys in the ring at the same time.  Other than that, this match is pretty forgettable.

The last 2 matches are from the 2000 edition of GAB and they weren't all that great.  The first one was an ambulance match between DDP and Mike Awesome.  It kind of just was a 10 minute bore fest to me and I hate saying that because I am a huge DDP fan but this contest just did not hold any type of interest to me whatsoever.  It could have been really good but this is when WCW was about to close so it's really no surprise.

The final match of the DVD set is a world title match with Jeff Jarrett defending the world title against Kevin Nash.  Man, I don't know what it was, but at this time in WCW it seemed like every freaking world title match had either Jarrett, DDP, Nash or Scott Steiner in it and with the exception of DDP none of the others were worth seeing.  This was a 17 minute piece of crap match.  Jarrett, to me, should go down as one of the worst world champions of all time and after seeing this match I think most people would agree with me.  He just can't work all that well.  Nash was pretty good in this match but still not as good as he could have been.  This was just a bad way to end the DVD set.

The Blu Ray matches were good picks.  They start with a cage match that featured Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA and Baby Doll taking on The Midnight Express and Jim Cornette.  I love the Midnights and was glad to see them in a match because I feel they were sorely missing from the DVD set.  This is a pretty good contest but not as good as could have been expected.  I did like watching anytime TA and Bobby Eaton got into the ring but other than that it was a standard cage match.

The next BR match is from 1988 and saw Ric Flair defend the world title against Lex Luger.  This match was from the actual PPV of the GAB that year and not the tour.  This was a freaking good match.  For anyone who thought Luger couldn't work, they should watch this match.  He was just stellar in this match and had me believing he was going to win this thing and then he got busted open.  It wasn't a bad cut but he bled enough that the Maryland Athletic Commission stopped the match and Flair was given the win.  It was kind of a cheap way to end the match but it kept their great feud going for years.

The next BR match was from 1991 and it saw Sting and Nikita Koloff battling in a Russian Chain match.  This match built for a long time.  Nikita had came back to WCW in Feb. or so of 1991 and had brutally attacked Lex Luger after Luger successfully retained his US title.  Sting took exception to that and then in May at SuperBrawl it appeared that Nikita again was targeting Luger.  Sting moved him out of the way and he took a fist wrapped with a chain around it to his face.  That led to this match.  The 1991 edition of GAB had some really forgettable matches but this one always stood out to me because of how much I wanted to see Sting kick Nikita's rear end.  I was so shocked and still am to this day whenever I re-watch it, that Nikita was able to win.  I was also equally shocked that they never settled their feud on PPV.  They kind of had a blow off match on a Clash of the Champions event.  Still, this is a fun match to watch.

The next BR match is from 1996 and featured Ric Flair and Arn Anderson taking on NFL players Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene.  I remember when this match was signed I thought it was a joke.  I thought there was no way they would have these two football players actually be able to hold their own against two of the greatest of all times.  Mongo and Kevin actually did hold their own but they held it just a little too well.  I didn't agree with that but the match was still fun especially the end when the Horsemen offered Mongo a briefcase and a Horsemen shirt and he took the deal and turned on his partner.  That was classic.  This was a good match but I kind of wish they would have included the Cruiserweight title match with Dean Malenko and Rey Mysterio, which to me, was the match of the night.

The last BR match offered is a world title match that saw Kevin Nash defend the world title against Randy Savage.  I have to say, this match was a let down.  I can remember being ready for a war and what I got was a horrible 7 minute match that ended in a DQ!!  What a horrible way to end a PPV and what an even more horrible way to end a DVD set.

All in all, this is a killer set.  I was a huge fan and still am of the old NWA and WCW matches so I for one am looking forward to more of their collections (here's hoping for a Halloween Havoc and SuperBrawl set).  I think the set represents the GAB very well.  There are some matches I wish was on the set like:  Ric Flair taking on Jimmy Garvin in a world title cage match, Dusty Rhodes battling Tully Blanchard in a Barbed Wire Ladder match for $100,000, as mentioned before the NWA world title finals with Gordy and Williams taking on Rhodes and Windham from 1992, Sting taking on Meng for the vacant US title in 1995, the Chris Benoit/Kevin Sullivan match from 1996 where they went all over the building and even into the bathroom (I know they wouldn't because of Benoit but God it was good), I would have liked to have seen the Madusa/Akira Hokuto match for the women's title and Madusa's career, again I would loved to have seen another Benoit match as he took on Booker T in the final best of 7 match for the TV title in 1998 and finally I would have liked to have seen another Benoit match as he and Perry Saturn took on DDP and Kanyon for the Tag titles in a stellar match from 1999.  There would have been no matches from 2000 I would have liked to have seen.

So, in summary, if you haven't seen this set and you are a big fan of the old NWA and WCW then I would check this one out.  It's up there with the Starrcade set and the War Games set that was released.  One last thing, I am a little surprised that the WWE did not release any matches from their version of the GAB and The Bash.  That was something I was preparing myself for.  Anyway, once again, if you haven't checked this one out, it is well worth the price.",1474588800,,18238,4.040502793296089
