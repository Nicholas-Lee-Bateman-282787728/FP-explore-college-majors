8092112,3,B000BTACIU,It wasn't amazing. I teetered on giving it 2 stars. Very dull movie.,1488326400,,68,4.3076923076923075
8092113,4,B000BTACIU,I remember this from when I was a kid. It's still pretty good.,1456963200,,62,3.8461538461538463

8092115,2,B000BTACIU,"This only shows the beginning of the movie.  Then we go into a TV interview featuring Margaret O'Brien.  There are two reasons I didn't return the disc.  First, it's interesting to see part of a TV version of the far better older movie with Janet Leigh and Robert Mitchum.  The dilaog is the same...but that's where the similarities end.  In the following interview, the image is so blurred that you don't really get to see Margaret O'Brien very well at all.  But O'Brien fans do hear her wonderful voice and get a feel for her charming personality when she was a young teenager.",1387497600,,579,4.572815533980583
8092116,2,B000BTACIU,"This version of Holiday Affair is a 3 act ""play"".  It is about 43 minutes in length (plus 10 minutes of extras at the end...see the end of my review). Film has very poor visual quality - dark, blurry and the film sputters once in a while. The sound is a bit scratchy too.  Looks like it was taped off the TV years ago.  It is a shortened version of the original movie with different actors.  It is a nice Christmas / holiday story for the whole family and we will probably still watch it (or listen to it more like a radio show) each year.  There are vintage commercials at the end, discussions with the stars of the movie, and an ad for a vintage upcoming show (10 minutes).",1262390400,,675,4.161538461538462
8092117,4,B000BTACIU,"I WAS HAPPY WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION OF ""HOLIDAY AFFAIR"". I OFTEN WONDER THOUGH WHY DOES PEOPLE VIEW REMAKES AUTOMATICALLY EXPECTING THEM TO BE VERY DIFFERENT. I DO LIKE CHARACTERS TO BE UPDATED AND IN MORE MODERN SETTINGS, BUT I DON'T LIKE THE BASIC STORYLINE TO BE VERY DIFFERENT OR TO APPEAR AS IF IT IS AN ENTIRELY ""DIFFERENT MOVIE."" IN THAT CASE IT MAY AS WELL BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOVIE WITH A DIFFERENT TITLE.

I AM NOT HAPPY TO HAVE READ THAT THE QUALITY OF THIS FILM IS BAD. I AM HAPPY THAT THERE ARE INTERVIEWS WITH THE ACTORS. IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION, THERE ARE NO INTERVIEWS. NO BEHIND THE SCENES DISCUSSIONS. NO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHERE THE STORY CAME FROM. OR ANYTHING ELSE. AND OF COURSE IT IS IN BLACK AND WHITE.

THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD POSSIBLE STILL BE ALIVE FROM THE ORIGINAL CAST WOULD BE: GORDON GEBERT (TIMOTHY ENNIS)AND HE WOULD HAVE TO BE AROUND 70 YEARS OLD. BY THE WAY, DOES ANYBODY OUT THERE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE MOVIE IS THE WAY IT ENDED. STEVE MASON DECIDES TO LEAVE TOWN TO GO PURSUE HIS DREAM IN CALIFORNIA. SO HE SENDS CONNIE ENNIS A TELEGRAM ABOUT THE MATTER. SO WHEN HER SON TELLS HER THAT SOON HE WILL BE GROWING UP, MOVING OUT, AND GETTING MARRIED, IT JUST SORT OF DAWNS ON HER THAT ONCE HER  ONE AND ONLY CHILD LEAVES HOME SHE WILL BE ALONE. SO SHE SENDS A TELEGRAM TO STEVE AND SHE AND TIMMY BOARDS THE SAME TRAIN HE IS ON AND THE MOVIE ENDS WITH A VERY PASSIONATE EMBRACE.

WHY NOT HAVE STEVE TO LEAVE AND THEY BOTH GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES BUT THEN STEVE REALIZE HE JUST CAN'T BEAR TO BE WITHOUT CONNIE AND HE COMES BACK TO CLAIM HER HAND. NOT JUST TO HAVE CARL DAVIS TO DISAPPEAR AFTER THE ROOMING HOUSE SCENE, LEAVING CONNIE TO CHASE AFTER STEVE. ALL IN ALL THE ORIGINAL VERSION WAS/IS WONDERFUL. I FINALLY BOUGHT A COPY LAST YEAR.

NOW ABOUT THIS VERSION, I WOULD STILL LIKE TO SEE IT. AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS IN COLOR? I HOPE SO. BUT IF NOT I WOULD STILL WANT A COPY. GOOD. BAD. OR JUST SOMETHING IN BETWEEN.

THE STARS ARE FOR THE ORIGINAL VERSION.",1260835200,,2067,4.244274809160306
8092118,3,B000BTACIU,Be careful to look at the actors.  This is listed as Holiday Affair as well.  I have 3 of the same movie but different titles.,1235952000,6,126,4.0
8092119,2,B000BTACIU,"I was looking forward to watching this DVD and adding it to my Christmas viewing collection. The script is very similar to the original 1949 movie; sometimes word for word; though some of the scenes and script were modified and changed for the television broadcast.

The picture quality on this DVD however, is extremely, very poor; and I wouldn't have purchased it, if I had known before hand.

Interviews with the performers and vintage commercials are also on this DVD at the end of this production, which was originally a live broadcast. However, The Truman Show was funny, but this was `for real' blatant, commercial phoniness; constantly conversing about how good LUX soap is and how they didn't use any other brand; and the constant false smile that Otto Kruger wore throughout, looked too painful to uphold.

Many whom enjoy archive viewing such as this, may find the commercialised conversation to be quite amusing and part of the entertainment; and it would be generally recommendable if it wasn't for the almost blurred picture quality throughout this entire DVD.

The sponsorship tooting their whistle at the end of the show would have left me less cynical and more entertained, if it wasn't for the almost unwatchable quality of this DVD which was certainly un-digitally re-mastered.",1195948800,15,1296,5.042056074766355
