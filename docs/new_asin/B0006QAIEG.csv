2191232,2,B0006QAIEG,Poor quality special effects and wooden acting. Not much better than an amateurish school pantomine. Possibly due to dubbing.,1168819200,,125,5.631578947368421
2191233,3,B0006QAIEG,"A little necessary background:

SADKO is a Russian fable about a harpist living in Novgorod who charms the Sea King and winds up rich. He also winds up sailing overseas to sell wares and, during a storm, is forced overboard where he once again charms the Sea King with his harp and is compelled to chose a wife from among the King's maidens before finding his way home to happily-everlasting-ness. (This has been turned into a famous opera by Rimsky-Korsakov called SAKDO.)

KALEVALA (pronounced: kah-lay-vah'-lah) is a Finnish epic poem compiled by Finnish poet Elias Lnnrot. It is at the heart of the Finnish culture and very familiar and dear to them. A few characters crop up thru out the poem. As does the magical Sampo which would spare the owners the rigor of work.

Which brings me to the movies:

THE MAGIC VOYAGE OF SINBAD was a Soviet Union's filming of SADKO dubbed by American Capitalist running dog Roger Corman into a Sinbad story. So now Sinbad is a tall, stocky blonde with heavy fur clothes to keep out the heat. The city of Novgorod substitutes for an Arabic city. But, even more ludicrious is the effort by the Soviet filmmakers, halfway thru the country's failed experiment in Socialism, to turn Sadko into a self-sacrificing proletariat (christians and liberals will be turned on by the message, too).

I can still recommend this film because the cinematography perfectly evokes a fairy tale, and the story can be enjoyable if you manage to put away your sophistication and see it thru a youngster's eyes. I saw it as a young teenager, and the scene with the Bird of Happiness with Rimsky-Korsakov's SONG OF INDIA filling my ears is one I recalled for all these years and caused me to search for the film until I finally found it again.

While the Finnish poem, KALEVALA, has very little plot spread diffusely thruout the enormous length, THE DAY THE EARTH FROZE pulls the threads together. There's something uneven about the plot. It is slow in spots, then engrossing in other spots. It is however, like the movie above, a visual delight, despite the (very obvious) skimpy production values.

I saw part of this film mocked by the Mystery Science Theater folk, but I kept thinking how I'd like to see the film without the intrusive teasing. I was very happy to find it on DVD and see it in its pristine form.

However, the cast credits are a hoot. They actors listed in the movie must be the voice dubbing actors (or they're entirely made up). Curiously, Amazon lists a different and more authentic-sounding cast (altho, they say the story is based on ""Norse/Scandanavian mythology"" -- which would be a surprise to the non-Scandanavian Finns).",1160092800,14,2666,4.755411255411255
2191234,1,B0006QAIEG,"""The Magic Voyage of Sinbad"" was originally a lovely Russian film, based on Rimski-Korsakov's opera, ""Sadko"", which Roger Corman bought for AIP back in the early 1960s and then hired Jack Woods to write a dubbing script which transformed the whole thing into an Arabian Nights fantasy. This in an effort to cash in on the popularity of such fare at the time (""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"", etc.) I was directly involved in the whole process of improving upon the original material. At the time I was an aspiring actor of sixteen and Mr. Woods was my agent. He worked mostly as an editor, but got to know Corman at some point, who persuaded him to go into the dubbing business. He completed a few projects which did reasonably well as matinee fillers and drive-in  make out movies, such as ""Pirate of the Blackhawk"" and ""Atlas"". When he came to ""The Magic Voyage of Sinbad"", I was called in as an editing assistant and dubbing actor. I provided the voice for young Hadabad, who runs away with the famous Sailor on his quest for the ... um ... ""Bird of Happiness"". In the course of my own adventures behind the scenes I met Mr. Corman (he held up his hand to shake in such a way that I thought he meant me to kiss his class ring, which I did), even worked with him directly in the editing room and on the dubbing stage, where he hung out and himself filled in voices for crowd scenes. It is unfortunate that it cannot be distinguished from any of the others, for he had a lovely voice at the time, together with a quite ironed and pressed and neatly parted collegiate look that was then quite the chick magnet (he appears in the same guise for ""Godfather II"", where he plays a member of the Senate Committee). When the film was completed, it was sneak previewed (with ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", possibly a greater work: certainly the lip synching was more believable, and there was this Audry Hepburn goddess in it that bested all the women in our effort), yes, sneak previewed, as I say, at a second run house in West Hollywood, forget the name of the place. But, well, in it's original form, Sinbad comes into town, takes a look around and says, ""I have come!"" This brought on laughter which did not stop for the other 79 minutes of the show. Mr. Corman took Jack aside in the lobby afterwards and said, ""Looks like we have a few problems."" I, myself, by this time had skulked away into the night, trying to change my voice. Later, I guess Corman hired Francis Coppola to pull the thing into better shape because, having recently bought the DVD from our host here and viewed it for the first time in ... what? forty years? ... well, a long time, anyways, I have to say it is not as bad as it was when it first came out. Seems to have been all pulled together with a narration and some of the dumber lines have been removed. Mine, sad to say, remain intact. My salary provided me with the price of a SAG card, which I never needed to use, for I didn't work again as an actor but went on to fail at other things until I finally settled on becoming the great novelist that I am today. Jack Woods subsequently did fine work as an editor for John Cassavetes (""Husbands"", etc.), even did some directing and acting for ""Equinox"", a film that was well reviewed by Rolling Stone ... um, you see, man, at that time it was fashionable to alter the consciousness in certain ways and things which would otherwise look quite ordinary became exceedingly groooooooovy!",1109894400,19,3452,4.427672955974843

Shows how you don't need CGI to make somnething wonderful. Especially love the underwater adventures in the Magic Voyage. By the way, the film is not really about Sinbad.

8042356,5,B0006QAIEG,"If you go into these with the understanding that the films are old and a little rough around the edges--and strangely dubbed--your expectations will be exceeded a hundredfold.  These are really, really good.  I think the Sinbad here is every bit as good as the better-known American versions. Lots of beautiful women and strong-looking men with swords and adventure in their blood.  Sinbad is on a mission to find The Bird of Happiness.  It's hilarious.  There's a totally captivating underwater scene with singing fish and octopus and Nautilis and his wife.  Sinbad escapes riding on a sea horse. The entire film is delightful.

The other film (""The Day the Earth Froze"") has incredible scenes from forests in God-Knows-Where.  Beautiful.  The main character genuinely ""surfs"" a log down a river--you don't see that nowadays!!

Really, both of these films capture scenes from exotic, obscure cultures from somewhere in the former Soviet Union or eastern Europe.  These are treasure troves.  They kind of reminded me of Bollywood films, but no singing routines. The colors and scenery are beautiful, and the sets are extremely creative. The sets also reminded me of original Star Trek episodes--conspicuous but colorfully effective.

I guarantee you that Spielberg and the guy who made Avatar have these films in their collections.",1303862400,,1331,5.221698113207547

8042358,4,B0006QAIEG,"THE MAGIC VOYAGE OF SINBAD was originally a Russian film that had nothing to do with the Arabian adventurer's exploits but the distributors figured - with good reason - that a movie released during the Cuban Missile Crisis era featuring a heroic Commie probably wouldn't generate much box office. So the producers re-tooled the script, turning it into a Sinbad tale. It IS a pretty cool film, featuring some fairly ambitious though uneven visual F/X. The Bird of Happiness is actually a really amazing effect, considering the time in which this film was made. Even though ""Sinbad"" is a blonde here you have to admit that otherwise the story as a whole does fit the mold of the traditional Arabian Knight escapades quite well. Overall, THE MAGIC VOYAGE OF SINBAD is a fine fantasy adventure film.

THE DAY THE EARTH FROZE is a little hard to follow but I suspect that this is more the fault of the sloppy adaption of the script into English and the dubbing. It's a cool fantasy film in its own right, with some truly amazing visuals. A note to younger viewers... these were made long before the age of CGI, so if you're expecting realistic F/X and super-detailed visuals you'll be sadly disappointed. The good news is that these movies require only suspension of disbelief & a good old-fashioned sense of imagination and wonder. If you have these traits then hop aboard... otherwise steer clear!

THE DVD: Even though the price for this single-sided double feature DVD has risen & fallen many times since its initial release I simply could never justify buying it for myself, so one year I asked for it for Christmas. If you must have this DVD then pick up a used copy and save yourself some serious cash as the disc is now out of print (OOP). I had long sought the ""Sinbad"" film and had enjoyed the lampooning of both movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Be warned: the video & audio quality of both films is only marginally acceptable. I'd guess the transfers were ""mastered"" from old late night TV airings or a really beat-up VHS tape. I'm not too sure about Sinbad but I know for a fact that The Day the Earth Froze was originally in some sort of widescreen. BOTH of these English language TV edits are cropped for 4x3 (pan & scan format). If you're hoping for nice 'Scope version of either movie you're out of luck here. That said, these aren't exactly popular movies available everywhere. In fact, the only other source I'm aware of for either is thru Sinister Cinema, where they go for $19 each. This DVD averages $10 - $20 used here on Amazon, so you're getting both films here for the cost of just one of the films thru SinCin. Considering the quality of both films is pretty much the same thru either retailer this double feature is an excellent deal.

One can only hope & pray that some day a company with access to decent film source elements will affect a quality restoration & remastering of these two impressive though lesser-known fantasy pictures. Actually ""The Day The Earth Froze"" WAS recently painstakingly restored in it's original 'Scope format using original film elements. Unfortunately, the restored version was only released in its native country (Finland?), in its original language only without English subtitles), so it's only formatted for Region 2/PAL (I believe), and thus will not play on American Region1 DVD & Blu-ray players (unless you have a region-free player). Google the film title and you'll see a few websites that show a side-by-side comparison of Before & After the restoration. The results are STUNNING! Perhaps someday a releasing outfit, (Hello, Shout! Factory, or Kino-Lorber or Olive Films... are you reading this?? Please?!?), will take that gorgeous restored video and marry it to a cleaned up version of the English dub track. Including a nice set of subtitles would be a real treat for folks who enjoy seeing a foreign film as originally presented. I know I'd gladly fork over the money to see it looking as good (or better) than when it was first released to theaters decades ago. Until that day we have this no-frills DVD to bookmark a space in our collections until something better comes along. 4 STARS",1241913600,11,4162,4.745856353591161
