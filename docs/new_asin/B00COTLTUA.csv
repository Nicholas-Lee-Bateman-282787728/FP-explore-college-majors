5731571,5,B00COTLTUA,"After reading reviews of previous versions, I was a little worried about ordering this set.  I am only on Season 2 but so far everything is great.  I am using the DVD setting on my bluray player.  The color and sound are good and I haven't noticed the blurring mentioned by others.

5731577,5,B00COTLTUA,"Honestly, I haven't begun to watch the collection yet.  This was an awesome Christmas present to me, that I have wanted for years.  Very glad that the price has dropped so much over the years to make them affordable!",1484611200,2,216,4.512820512820513
5731578,4,B00COTLTUA,"I am enjoying watching the series again. There are a few quality issues on some of the episodes - not the discs themselves, but when the manufacturer transferred the original film onto dvds -  blurring and such. But overall, it is a great buy. .... UPDATE: the blurring is NOT the transfer onto the discs - we finally realized it was everytime they shot against a green screen ... LOL ... not meant for 60 inch tv's ....",1483574400,9,420,4.384615384615385
5731579,5,B00COTLTUA,"One of the most innovative of its time. A complex 5-year story line where the characters become more intricate and evolve season by season.

5731581,5,B00COTLTUA,"Purchased with some trepidation based on other unfavorable reviews. Found the product well packaged, in good shape, have enjoyed the first two seasons with no problems. I like that that you can turn on closed captions if you want. Yes, the CGI is a bit rough on a modern wide screen TV but its as good as it was back in the 90s on a tube TV so no real complaints there. If you're a fan you will really enjoy this boxed set.",1525219200,,423,4.108433734939759

5731583,5,B00COTLTUA,"Now I FINALLY have the COMPLETE collection of B-5!  :-) I actually already had Season One, (individually), and Crusade; but, at the time I started the collection the individual seasons were quite expensive!  This new bundle of EVERYTHING was MUCH more affordable.  :-)

Item arrived today, 4-22-2018. Package was in perfect condition. I can't wait to get back into B-5 all over again.  :-)",1524355200,,389,5.015625
5731584,5,B00COTLTUA,"We really enjoyed the Babylon 5 series.  The DVD's were in brand new condition and we had no problems playing them.  There were 2 movies missing from the ""complete collection series"", so we purchased them separately.  The only thing missing was the best order to view the movies within the TV series.  We were able to google this information on the internet; but found it was bit argumentative.",1523923200,,394,4.75

5731587,5,B00COTLTUA,"This is not absolutely correct. The Legend of the Rangers and Babylon 5: Lost Tales are not included in this collection. But, other than that, this is a great collection of Babylon 5",1522108800,,182,4.545454545454546
5731588,4,B00COTLTUA,"One of my Favorite shows. All of the Episodes I have left are on VHS tape, so they are fallible.

Did You like SciFi in the 90's.  did you watch StarTrek and think, this is good, but it need a little more drama and story-arc continuity, do you like cheesy 90's humor, then you are in for a treat, cause this bad boy brings you all 5 seasons (no alcohol necessary) AND the movies ( Some alcohol necessary).",1517529600,3,398,4.293333333333333

The DVD Covers in the Box are well done.
For a DVD is a pleased Quality.
But is not complete at all.
Why they didn't release one of the best Sci-Fi Series on Blu-Ray?
Please do this historical Sci-Fi Series a favour and release it on Blu-Ray.
The Series deserved it!",1511308800,,297,4.228070175438597

5731613,5,B00COTLTUA,"As the kid who was born just before Season 5 got started is heading off to college, my spouse and I are thoroughly enjoying re-watching the series.  Yes, some stilted dialogue, but some brilliant one liners, and Katsulas and Jurasik in particular are still marvelous  actors with delightful characters.  Some nostalgia and sorrow about how many actors have died, and many so early.  I loved this story, and probably always will.",1500854400,,428,4.985915492957746

5731615,5,B00COTLTUA,"Some of the best writing for the screen - up there with the best of Stephen Moffat and the best of the ""Breaking Bad, ""Better Call Saul,"" ""Lost"", and TWD and ""Battlestar G."" reboot crews. The computerized effects look primitive by today's standards - even though the pioneering effects were themselves science fiction at the time the series was made. Consider the effects a unique quirk, just like the stage sets for the incomparable ""I, Claudius."" B-5 has also turned out to be strangely prophetic, of our own times - and watch for a a tipping of the hat to its influence in ""Breaking Bad.""",1498262400,3,591,4.6380952380952385
5731616,2,B00COTLTUA,The audio is very poor quality. But other than that good series,1498176000,,63,4.333333333333333
5731617,5,B00COTLTUA,"Babylon 5 --- This is Sci-Fi the way it SHOULD be made. Complete stories, well told, and characters with depth. Even if you are not a science fiction fan you will still love the character driven stories. Characters here develop over time, not static cardboard cutouts, flawed heroes, changing allegiances, developing friendships and even love among enemies. Humor to rage and everything in between. There is someone here for almost anyone to love or hate or even both at the same time.
  The stories of wars told not as black and white (good guys in white, bad guys in black) but as complex events told from the point of view of both sides. And in some cases third parties involved for their own reasons, intentionally or not, as well. And unlike most all other shows not all battles here are resolved by open conflict, but by the thinking of inspired leaders who create peace without killing the enemy.
  Note this is a thorough well developed universe, you can not watch a single episode and get the feel for the show. In fact it actually takes about 2 full seasons just to know all the major players. So grab you favorite meal, a few snacks and drinks and settle in for the long haul as once you do get into the show you will not want to stop, and will be screaming for more when it does unfortunately end.

  Sadly as great as Babylon 5 is Crusade is not. This show was rushed to say the least many stories contradict each other out right, and as good as the concept was it was not ready to be released and it shows badly. This show looks more like a polished rough draft then a complete ready to air show.",1497398400,,1610,4.4006734006734005

5731624,5,B00COTLTUA,"What can I say.  It's Babylon 5.  Probably the best science fiction series ever on TV in the United States.

I began researching B5 earlier in the year and was surprised by how the team of people worked so hard to produce it.  Michael O'Hare having to leave after the first season because of health problems;  but that didn't slow things and they continued with just minor changes to the story arc that encompassed 5 years.

To the young people who never saw it in syndication over the years;  you need to see this.  The story is very complex and it's a very rewarding experience to see all the little bits come together.",1491350400,13,621,4.433628318584071

5731627,5,B00COTLTUA,"Tried buying the series on VHS in the 90's at $20/tape, one episode each.  I ran out of money and never got to the end.  I STILL haven't gotten to the end, but only because I'm enjoying it from the start and I just haven't had time to finish yet. In season 4 and seeing episodes I've never seen before!

8584153,5,B00COTLTUA,"One of the greatest SciFi Television shows ever produced. The first real example of a TV series with a clear planned story arc. A tv series with a planned ending and a strong progression of stories and foreshadowing all leading towards that tightly scripted ending. Pure SF television perfection. This set gloriously includes nice crisp DVD versions of the 5 seasons of Babylon 5. The full 13 episodes of Crusade and the 5 Primary Movies. In the Begining, The Gathering, Thirdspace, The River of Souls and A Call to Arms. The only B5 universe stuff missing is the horrid Legends of the Rangers.
