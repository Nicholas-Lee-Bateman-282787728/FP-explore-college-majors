8294382,5,B001DNQSIG,"The Brandenburg Concerti, one of the extreme pinnacles of Western music, conducted by one of the most important pioneers in early music performance.

Nikolaus Harnoncourt was the undisputed God of early music in general and Bach in particular, that is at least in the 1960s and 70s. How we saved our pennies and rejoiced to obtain each of the major canons of Bach, rendered by Harnoncourt; how we anxiously awaited each new Bach Cantata album! How we struggled in our faith between Harnoncourt and Karl Richter, so frighteningly dissimilar yet each so alluring in his own way! (Which of the two was the true prophet, which was the heretic, was it possible to believe in both, etc. etc. :)

Well, some gods fade, however slightly ... and probably many including myself started straying from the fold sometime around the early 80s.  The waters simply had to be tested.  Karl Richter had already passed on, and St. Nikolaus was becoming mannered.  (The worst was yet to come, as he would soon start dabbling in Mozart, Beethoven, Bruckner--we wish he had stuck with the Baroque, oh dear.)  There was a new generation of early-music specialists, Hogwood, Bruggen, Kuijken--too many to list, and we usually liked what we heard.

So the world has moved on; Harnoncourt is still highly respected for his lifetime work, although early music nowadays does not sound much like his early promulgations. As to this performance ... we see it on its own island. It is one man's vision, and it is a worthwhile vision, although I doubt many people view it with the same rabid enthusiasm as they did 40 years ago: ""Ah yes, exactly the way Bach intended!!"" (They save that litany for the current God Gardiner, but he too will be replaced in due course.)

Harnoncourt's own vision evolved; this rendering is not much like his stark recording of 1962 (which I still do very much enjoy). He takes a lot of liberties in matters of expression and rubato (take for example the first movement of the 6th concerto). It is a picture of 1983 ... not 2015, not 1962, and not, I fear, 1721.

I will mention the program does run very much like being at a live performance, which I appreciate. That means including the little things, like extended pauses between movements where the performers are getting a few extra seconds' rest, or where Alice is switching from violino piccolo to regular, making little clunky noises; etc. I appreciate those moments and am glad they weren't edited out.

The picture has good color but the density is extremely weak. I do not have a bigscreen TV and even on mine it looks nowhere near as nice as Richter's videos from a dozen years earlier, or anything by Karajan of the same era. I suppose it is because this was videotaped and the others were filmed. If that is the case, it's OK videotape for the era. But there will never be a Blu-ray of this issue--it doesn't even reach DVD standards.

In any event this is highly recommended, excellent music-making with no apologies necessary, and as a time capsule of middle-period Harnoncourt, not to mention timeless Bach, and I'm happy to review it on the 330th birthday of the old boy himself :)",1426896000,2,3147,4.714025500910747
8294383,5,B001DNQSIG,"Superior to Richter's, Abbado's, von Karajan's, and more contemporary performances such as the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra's. Interviews concerning each concerto is a great opportunity to focused on perfomance and learning on the instrument period approach leading by Harnoncourt. The two-DVD set also includes the known Coffee Cantata, Concerto for Violin, Oboe and Orchestra and the Orchestral Suite Nr. 3. For an early 80's recording I would expect a higher definition, even Richter's performance of early 70's is superior on this aspect.",1388448000,4,540,5.679012345679013
8294384,5,B001DNQSIG,"This is a dual-DVD set.  While one reviewer has commented on the Brandenburg Concertos in some detail, it is nonetheless necessary to mention the other disc, containing principally of the rarely performed (today) Coffee Cantata BWV 211.
The drinking of coffee attained an addictive degree in Europe during J S Bach's time, and like most television commercials, this cantata depicts the joy and obssessions of coffee by a young girl, to the dismay of her father.
The piece is a rather short one, with a narrator (tenor), sung here by the great German tenor Peter Schreier (who also 'appears' in this performance.)
The wilful daughter is beautifully portrayed by the beautiful Janet Perry, with a wonderfully rendered Heute noch, with the exception of the imperfect diction.  As her father, bass  Robert Holl is a dramatically effective stern father.

The only quibble one might have with this set is that it should have also included the Peasant Cantata.",1349222400,5,3821,5.052715654952077
8294385,5,B001DNQSIG,"Brandenburg Concertos engross a music-lover forever. What attracts me in this version is its focus on the conversational and relational character of the music. It gives the performance a gripping emotional and erotic charge. The pieces require virtuosic playing, but virtuosity is the medium here, not the goal. These are in a way disciplined performances; the musicians do not get carried away by their abilities. It is a group of people conversing through music, and they do so with eloquence and elegance. Theirs is not a light or bubbly chat, but neither is it ever scripted or turgid. It is a thoughtful, intimate conversation among and for music-lovers; partaking in it makes for an absorbing experience.

The two DVD set also includes several smaller pieces as well as a series of interviews with Harnoncourt about the Brandenburg Concertos. The interviews are quite simply among the most intelligent and pleasurable `bonuses' I have encountered. Here too, the point is not just to add some nice pictures for fans to ogle at--as bonus features often tend to be--it is rather to explore a work of art for an interested audience. A rare treat!",1291593600,12,1148,5.010471204188482
