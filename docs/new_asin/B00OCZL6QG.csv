8683251,4,B00OCZL6QG,"This is a film of two young gangs in Baltimore. There is a female gang called the Tender Trio and a bunch of young kids called The Wolf Pack. Much of the film centers around JD (Branden March), a smart kid who hasn't finished school. He makes his money hustling and has turned to drug dealing. The film includes gangs kidnapping and ransoming members. JD gets caught by the cops and refuses to plea bargain his supplier. JD has dreams of traveling that are quickly dying.

In many ways this is better than other gangster films in that the dialogue is more real (for those who have been to Baltimore). However this film suffers from uneven acting, poor sound quality, and camera angels that could have been better.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Adult themes. Generous 4 stars.",1443398400,,788,4.621428571428571
