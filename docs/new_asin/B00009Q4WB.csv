7992647,5,B00009Q4WB,"If you have any questions regarding the grace, the might,
and the integrity of the African-American conception known
as Jazz, come hear and see this superb concert from one
of the great treasures of the world. That this sterling
aesthetic presentation came through BET's Jazz Channel
is a miracle of no small proportions, and such fortifying
presentations from BET as a whole should be enthusiastically
encouraged.
Ageless in wisdom, bountiful in song, pianist Randy Weston
brings his peerless instrumental balladry to bear in this
2003 live performance for the St. Lucia Jazz Festival. Even
for this amazing artist, going strong across the span of a
half-century plus, LIVE IN ST. LUCIA is a precious moment.

With his African Rhythms Quintet, Weston weaves his
lushly harmonic, polyrhythmic spell, melodies yielding
the irresistible summons of Great Black Music reaching
deep into your soul. The blessings offered by the pianist's
imploring hush and lyrical thunder strike all the deeper
in the company of this robust ensemble.
On African Percussion, Neil Clarke juggles multiple tempos
with searing finesse, as bassist Alex Blake thrums sharp,
soulful litanies which will have many a viewer looking for
the unseen kora player working wizardry through the larger
fiddle! Trombonist Benny Powell nimbly bounces his alluring
round tones up and down and all around each rhapsody, as
Music Director Talib Kibwe (T.K.Blue) unleashes his unique
brand of warmth and spirit on reeds and flute.

Through Weston, this is a quintet to savor and enjoy,
time and again. Listen to the waltzing swing of ""Little
Niles"", the dancing leaps of ""African Cookbook"", or
the ever-steady, oncoming Blues of ""Blue Moses"", and
you know you are hearing sorcery of the most devout
order.
For those who have this exciting concert on CD, the
DVD offers stunning cinematography which beautifully
complements the Music in play. As a further bonus,
the DVD offers a fine interview with Weston himself,
who's never at a loss for words or vision in discussing
his Art, the world from which it comes, and all that's
at stake.

Here is Music and Image in gleeful, determined
human motion.",1115856000,6,2154,5.148571428571429

If you don't know about Randy Weston, he is a great jazz piano player and composer, who incorporates many elements of African music into the composition and playing of his own music, in a seamless organic way, without it seeming like a gimmick.",1060560000,3,378,4.611940298507463
