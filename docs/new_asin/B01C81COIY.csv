8752528,3,B01C81COIY,"Guess I'm old fashioned, but I still want my super heroes clean shaven.  Didn't care for Ben Affleck's Batman.  Plus, the plot strayed from a lot of the details and characteristics of the original DC comics.  I was disappointed.",1470873600,,228,4.794871794871795
8752529,5,B01C81COIY,"Batman V Superman was a fun, well thought out movie.  Yes, a couple of moments it seemed jumbled together.  But it worked.  And I look forward to its sequel.

The performances were great as well.  Ben Affleck was a great Batman.  And Henry Cavill followed up his last fantastic job as Superman, with another great showing.  Jesse Eisenberg was awesome as A. Luthor

I highly recommend owning this movie for fans of Batman, Superman, and the Justice League.",1463443200,,456,4.756410256410256

This movie links locations and current events of our daily life, which can make the movie get too close to the heart to some people and make it too dark.  DCs approach to the universe is new and unforgiving, it challenges the viewers to think and imagine a world in which superheroes live; It challenges fans to open their mind to new interpretations of characters and even geography; and it finally challenges you to imagine been in the shoes of a superhero, concepts of what and how you feel and handle lost, how you cherish the word or the name of a lost love one. Forget what you know or what you think what you know and let this movie guide you in a very interesting and new universe.  While this movie is based on very specific comic book stories, it only takes portions of each to create this new world.  However, even though, I think this movie is great, there are some issues, the character design of doomsday leaves a lot to desire, there are plot holes that are left to be answered by other movies, so in a good portion this movie is a bridge to the rest of the DCU and unfortunately for this movie, the other guys making superhero films have created a standard expectation, so this movie breaks that, which is great for fans like me, and bad for other fans. This movie is in a new category, you can probably compare this movie to Training Day, but you cant compare it to Iron Man.",1460937600,8,1492,4.336917562724015
8752531,5,B01C81COIY,"Batman v Superman is easily by far the best movie ever! .. This is an original movie and NOT a Marvel popcorn flick or an  unoriginal do over Star Wars episode 4 The Force Slumbers by Disney.  It sticks to the comics source materials ,the visual plot self explanatory is amazing and so are the battles,  simply phenomenal. The trailer teasers don't even show close , to what this movie offers. I will say this thou , before you watch this movie 1. See  Man of Steel  2. Know something about the DC comics 3.  Pay close attention and 4.  Enjoy  , preferably in IMAX 3D for the best experience.
  Oh and one last thing , don't listen to the haters . Most of them are Marvel Disney bias. Who work really hard to put DC down.
  And for the record , I was and am a Marvel fan before DC. I'm just not a bias when you see to what's best.

 Kudos to director Zack Snyder, your brilliant ! ..",1460073600,11,883,4.087719298245614
