8431645,4,B004J4T1LM,Live music is always the best; if the musicians are good and these guys are.  Ray was an early influence in my musician husband's life and thus always an inspiration.,1368921600,,166,4.533333333333333
8431646,5,B004J4T1LM,"There are two kinds of folkies in this world: those who remember and loved Koerner, Ray and Glover, and those who are either too young or got no class.  Anybody who was ever lucky enough to see them or hear them had to love them.  They were just that good.  I use the past tense because Snaker is gone, Tony became a great music writer with Rolling Stone, and John stopped playing the music we loved from that time in favor of what I can only call children's music, because I remember it from elementary school, 60 years ago.  And even though it was never done so well as the amazing Spider John does it, and it does have its afficianados, it would never have made him the original and innovative hero we loved.  Sorry John, but blues no more belongs to only black people than opera belongs only to whites.  I still play my old KR&G, and Dave's stuff but I buy the later Koerner albums and listen to them once.  And your Running, Jumping, Standing Still is still outstanding!  Anyway, this is the boys, in the flesh, in their prime, at the kind of low key venue they loved and loved them.  If you know who and what they were, you can have a piece of it, and you will love it!",1362009600,4,1175,4.209821428571429
8431647,5,B004J4T1LM,"Spider J, Dave, and Tony lay down righteously on this must have LIVE video - very good quality Acoustic Rag Rock Blues jamming on this one - if you love real music and want to see and hear some true Americana masters of the craft; you better check this out while you can still get your hands on it. Amazon has the best price with fast shipping - I got my copy days early with free shipping - Thank You Amazon and Dave Ray R.I.P. brother; you layed it down with Truth. I am very happy to have this amazing recording of this historical event: as I said before this is a must have.",1310169600,8,578,4.078947368421052
