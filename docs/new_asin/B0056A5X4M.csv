8459324,5,B0056A5X4M,Well done. Cyborg is clear and concise. He covers the fundamentals of each position and brings out small details as well. I have the more recent NoGi DVDs as well and both are amazing in quality and content. Really good stuff for mobile big guys.,1455753600,,246,4.488888888888889

8459328,5,B0056A5X4M,"Great guard to play in-between the pass and turtle guard for a more complete guard system. very powerful sweep with detailed instruction and fail safe options also works nicely with coss guard

Love cyborg a very flexible big guy fun to watch easy to learn from That being said I would also stipulate that this stuff is high level and before you can implement it properly you need a solid guard recovery system particularly from half guard. blu belt or higher would deffinately beniffet from this set
 The basics cover getting upside down for those of us less agile and coordinated unlike the rubber guard tornado is more universally applicable (not bashing rubber guard love Eddie have the book and DVD use it all the time however we have a small group,of 20 guys,myself and one other guy can use it with any proficiency)
Lastly this review was only about the volume specific to the tornado guard there're also volumes on the closed guard and half guard the set is worth the money for the tornado material alone",1386460800,,1012,4.679775280898877
8459329,5,B0056A5X4M,Great instructional to Cyborg's game. Lots of details YouTube videos can't give you. Worth every penny. Wish I would have bought it long ago.,1376611200,,141,4.916666666666667
8459330,5,B0056A5X4M,"I really enjoyed this DVD set as it goes beyond the tornado and offers much more. Various closed guard and half guard theories. Made me want to learn more from Cyborg, he seems like a great guy too. Easy to learn, drills and warmups included. Highly recommend.",1358726400,3,260,4.553191489361702
