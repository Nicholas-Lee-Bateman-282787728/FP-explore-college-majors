3945627,4,B002LCOHPE,"In the 4th season they had Max and 99 get married adding some much needed new material for the joke and gag writers. And in the
5th and last season they added another new twist to the show. Max and 99 become expectant perants giving even more room for new
gags.
They also did more spoofs of popular movies and such modifing the stories just enough to fit into the existing spy spoof that
Get Smart had been all along.
These new twists were needed. After all, there are only so many ways you can do a good spoof of James Bond type stories, and
even by the 3rd season those were getting a little worn and predictable. The 1st and 2nd seasons were better. Even so, the
5th season is still well worth watching providing lots of laughs.",1261180800,7,731,4.266187050359712
3945628,4,B002LCOHPE,"First came love, then came marriage, and now come baby Smarts in the baby carriage!

And the fifth and final season of the classic spy spoof ""Get Smart"" focuses on that new complication for bumbling spy Maxwell Smart and his new wife 99. The baby focus is a bit tiresome at times (even if it does produce the Chief and Larabee babysitting!) but it's still a pretty hilarious series with plenty of long-running gags and catchphrases, and an endless stream of bizarre conspiracies to destroy the free world. Would you believe...?

Max and 99 are sent to rescue a professor who is being kept under an unbreakable glass dome, but as they're being chased off the premises, 99 drops a bombshell on her husband -- she's pregnant. Max is so elated by this that he not only runs through a brick wall, but blabs his secret identity to a nearby reporter, putting the mission in jeopardy.

And of course, their impending parenthood becomes a part of the new missions -- defeating Ironhand with Operation Baby Buggy Switch, dealing with a bunch of explosive dolls, and Max must even ""marry"" a KAOS black widow on his anniversary. Worst of all, a mixup with some trenchcoats causes Max and 99 to end up heading for a KAOS clinic when 99 goes into labor -- not to mention going up against the deadly Simon the Likable.

Among the other weird cases: the treasure of C. Errol Madre, wounded gangster who thinks he's a doctor, serial killings with banana peels, rapid aging, acid in the Washington water supply, inexplicable weather changes (snow in Miami?), a wax museum with very lifelike residents, a house of crazy gothic secrets, attempting to keep an informer safe from the Exterminator, a devious 99 doppelganger, security leaks via pseudo-Roman spas, spying plants, a descendent of Christopher Columbus who has inherited the United States, and Max going undercover as the worst butler the Bulmanian Embassy has ever seen.

""Get Smart Season Five"" isn't quite the best that the series had to offer, and the baby focus is a bit offputting at times (since it's so far removed from the World of Spies). But considering this series had been running in the same basic groove for four seasons before it, it's still remarkably fresh and funny -- still has plenty of movie spoofs (""Witness for the Prosecution,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""House of Wax,"" ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""), classic running gags, and general strangeness.

Along the way, there are plenty of bizarre plots by the evil KAOS (being attacked by a wax werewolf!) and bizarre puzzles that Max and 99 somehow work out, often by putting themselves in comical danger, ranging from Vincent Price's hallucinogenic plan (""Of course! Everyone will think it's a folk rock festival!"") to very odd plastic surgeries. But there are also some more down-to-earth problems that the newlyweds face, such as Max and 99 having to leave their babies in the care of Chief and Larabee.

And the dialogue and comic relief are absolutely priceless (""That's just what we've been waiting ten years to hear. Larabee, You got your tape recorder?"" ""Right here, Chief. When do you want me to turn it on?""), and the babies don't stop the hysterical physical comedy (Max's inability to buttle).

Don Adams is the heart of the series, with his quirky face, nasal voice, odd body language and confident catchphrases (""And loving it!""), and while he's still a bumbler as an agent he makes a great dad. Barbara Feldon gets to play out some pregnancy cravings and insecurities (""Fat fat the water rat!"") while still sometimes doing some solid agent work (the ultimate working mom! She saves the free world then goes home to babies).

Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering Chief, and Bernie Kopell gets in a last laugh as the delightfully uptight villain Siegfried -- and with Max being more competent, Robert Karvelas' Larabee takes over as the resident clueless weirdo (""Larabee, confiscate that plant."" ""I can't do that, Chief. I'm not a priest!"").

It's the final season and got a bit worn around the edges, but ""Get Smart Season Five"" is still a hilarious spoof-fest. Still Smart after all these years.",1252886400,24,4127,4.857752489331436

Barbra Feldon's role is also a bit more active, as she actually shoots a gun and throws a few punches.  As a spy spoof, it's still a lot of fun, although some of the standing gags got a little stale.

A bit of light nonsense, and good clean fun.  Safe for the whole family.",1406160000,4,411,4.151898734177215

3945659,4,B002LCOHPE,"In its 5th and final season, ""Get Smart"" opened on a brand new network--moving to CBS after being cancelled by NBC--and featuring a new opening credit; well, at least the first few seconds of the opening credits are new, as Max is seen driving a 1969 Opel GT, which he also used in the actual season 5 episodes--unlike the blue Karmann Ghia from Seasons 3 & 4.

Also new to the show was the plot twist that the married Agents, 86 & 99, were expecting a new bundle of joy. Actually, 2 bundles of joy--as Agent 99 gave birth to twins (a boy and a girl).

The baby angle was ultimately not that important of an issue as to the development of the characters given how rarely we actually see the twins after they were born. The show just continued to chug along with Max and 99 continuing to foil the many plots by KAOS to overthrow our government.

One big disappointing angle to the show's 5th season--aside from the fact that the show's quality had definitely dipped in its last year--was the fact that Siegfried and Shtarker only make one appearance in the show's final year--and to top if off, that one appearance was a show that was almost entirely devoid of Maxwell Smart, as Don Adams briefly appears at the beginning of the episode to explain that he and the Chief were stuck in a snowstorm in Miami and Bill Dana steps into the Maxwell Smart role.

An episode of ""Get Smart"" without Maxwell Smart seems unthinkable--but Bill Dana and Barbara Feldon give it the old college try anyways & it's the last hurrah for Siefgried and Shtarker, so I was able to enjoy it--for the most part.

Overall, ""Get Smart"" in its final year definitely seems to fit the pattern of most of the classic sitcoms I'm a fan of, in that the final season is usually the weakest--but that's hardly to say the show is devoid of any laughs, far from it. It's just that considering the high peak the show was at during its first 4 years, Season 5 is a bit of a letdown.

But--if you're a fan of Maxwell Smart--then you probably shouldn't let that stop you from buying this DVD and completing your collection. Thanks for 5 mostly great years Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, Ed Platt, Bernie Kopell, Dick Gautier, Robert Karvelas and King Moody.

3945671,5,B002LCOHPE,"Max and 99 are now married, a plot device that really bogged down the beginning of the fourth season.  In this, the fifth season, that idea is taken to its logical conclusion as Max and 99 have twin boys.

Fortunately, this time the domestic developments are less tiresome.  The babies are for the most part kept in the background...although it does stretch credibility to think that Max and 99 manage to find this endless supply of babysitters while they're out on missions.

At any rate, the comedy continues in top form.  Though the plots are now starting to become the slightest bit repetitive, the jokes are just as funny as they were in the first season.  Some of the episode titles are wonderfully parodic, such as ""House of Max"", ""Smartacus"", and my personal favorite, ""The Mess of Adrian Listenger"".  And in this, the final year, you get some recognizable guest stars which range from the classically silly Ronald Long and Pat Paulsen to the deliciously hammy Vincent Price and Jonathan Harris.  It also looks like CBS/Talent Associates spent a little more money on location filming as well.  Clearly the producers were not coasting.

Even the credits get a facelift, including the music, although whether you'll like them is a matter of taste.  But at the end of quite a few acts, the producers decided that it would be funny for the actors to mug for the camera -- that is, look directly at the viewer when someone else does something funny.  Breaking the fourth wall in this way is not entirely unknown, but it does look odd here, since they rarely did it in any of the other four seasons.  Personally, I can take it or leave it.

This season also contains one other little oddity:  an episode without Maxwell Smart.  Though Don Adams almost literally phones in an appearance in the teaser, he is replaced for the rest of ""Ice Station Siegfried"" by Bill Dana.  (Apparently Adams was unhappy with the quality of the script and he decided to sit this one out.)  Though Dana is no Adams, it says something about the show that it was strong enough to carry this episode with the help of everyone else:  Feldon, Platt, and the guest stars.

One thing you can't say about Get Smart is that the series was going downhill.  With comedy talent like this, Get Smart may have hit a few bumps in the road, but it never jumped the shark.",1341360000,,2336,4.60774818401937

If it was because the show was axed, they should have done a special or at least a season 6 to give it an ending. I know there were spin-offs but it's not really the same. There are tons of extras! And I am glad there is an extra about the passing of Don Adams. Is it just me, or did Agent Larabee really seem to become a strong character in this season? I would have loved to have had a season 6 with more of him!",1308528000,2,537,3.8035714285714284

3945680,4,B002LCOHPE,"The seven Emmy award winning series starring Don Adams as everyone's favourite bumbling CONTROL agent,Maxwell Smart,continues merrily along into Season Four.
This season brings back CONTROL's fave robot Hymie(Dick Gautier) and KAOS's funniest bad guy Siegfried(Bernie Kopell).This is the season also that Max and 99 finally get married. Further,as you watch,you will see the Chief and Agent Larabee not only getting more show time but much funnier lines. In previous seasons the incompetent bumbling was more Max focused,whereas this season and the following one,CONTROL as a whole would be put onto the same bumbling level as Max. Injecting this broader dynamic into the proceedings equalled more laughs.
The writers in season four really got into title parodies with such ep titles as ""The Impossible Mission""(TV show ""Mission Impossible""),""The Tale of Two Tails""(Dickens'""The Tale of Two Cities""),""Absorb the Greek""(book and movie""Zorba the Greek"")
,""To Sire with Love""(movie""To Sir,with Love"") and many more.
As usual Barbara Feldon is on hand to intro all the eps in her usual droll style. The only special features(unfortunately)are just commentary tracks on two eps,one with Feldon and co-creator Buck Henry and another with James Caan. With the latter Caan says little or nothing about what is being shown on screen;an ep he was in. He just randomly reminisces about his relationship with Adams.
Technically the transfer is the same as all other season's. As crisp as the picture may be you seem to be looking through a very fine gauze,which I find perplexing.
Overall this second to last season keeps the proceedings moving on a steady beam. Adams continues to keep his character up to snuff,with the usual inflections of Stan Laurel thrown in every so often for good measure. As I mentioned the Chief and Larrabee get more air time and laughs and Max takes the marital plunge with 99. The lack of special features and the ""funny"" film to DVD transfer gets a good full star taken off its' rating. Otherwise season four will definitely please its fans.",1261267200,,2060,5.1706586826347305

8372509,4,B002LCOHPE,The fifth season of Get Smart turned out to be the last season for it.  By now Smart and 99 were married.  She was still called 99.  This set is just like the others with four discs of episodes and one disc of extras.  AS far as I'm concerned this is still the funniest t.v. show of all time.  And even though this was the last season it was still just as good.,1491350400,,361,3.8904109589041096

8372511,5,B002LCOHPE,"Get Smart has been one of my favorite television shows since I was a kid. As a kid, the fun for me was the antics of comic genius Don Adams. As an adult , half of shows fun is trying to catch all the references to the spy movies and television shows that Get Smart brilliantly satirizes. The other half is still the antics of Don Adams.

Video: The remastering done on Get Smart is incredible. The show is presented in its original full frame 1:33 ratio and looks fantastic. The episodes look clean and bright. The colors are vivid and really pop. It really is a revelation after watching drab washed out prints on television for years.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English 2.0 stereo. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are no subtitles on the set but it is close-captioned in English only.

Extras: All 26 episodes feature an audio introduction from Barbara Feldon.
There is also a commentary track by Bill Dana (Agent Quigley) on Ice Station Siegfried.",1489190400,,2143,4.5718015665796345
