My BF and I both love this series, and I know we're going to have a good time, watching through it again and again. ^w^",1482796800,,249,3.9019607843137254

8673442,5,B00MODCIL0,"I normally don't like humorous anime because they're usually very juvenile and annoying. However, the humor in this particular one is witty and subsequently appeals to my adult sensibilities; the dialogue is filled with modern cultural references and serves as a comedic commentary on modern life.

Additionally, the animation may not be as fluid as that of Attack on Titan or other high-budget animes, but it's good for the dialogue-centric story that this anime tells (though there is definitely action).

As for the English dub, it's great and suffices as the primary dub through which you can absorb the story if you wish; if not, you can choose the original Japanese dub.

Overall, I really like this show and give it five stars.

By the way, in case you haven't noticed, this is the UK import, which is a Region-B BluRay disc. Hence, if you're in the U.S. or any other non-Region-B country, you'll have to watch this using a region-free BluRay player or a computer BluRay drive (and set the region of whatever software you're using to Region B). It arrived in two weeks in brand-new condition as advertised.",1472947200,,1113,4.842105263157895
8673443,5,B00MODCIL0,"Ever since this show stopped streaming on Netflix, I wanted to own this anime series. It is fun, hilarious and very well written.",1472688000,,129,4.6521739130434785
