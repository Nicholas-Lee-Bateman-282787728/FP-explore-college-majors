8239905,5,B00112OC4G,"The Battle of City Springs is a compelling story that shows how determined parents and teachers can overcome the EDUCATION BLOB (as John Stossel calls it) and turn their ineffective schools into a place where all kids can and do learn.  A great misconception is that poor, disadvantaged - mostly black kids can't learn.  That's just not so, and it's proven every day at City Springs (and other schools that don't buy into this ""Touchy-feely""crap that most of our young teachers are getting in the teacher's colleges.

The fact is, and this video shows it, with good tools and committed educators, kids will learn!

This school uses Direct Instruction to teach kids from Kindergarten on as needed to read and read well.  Look at the videos on the Direct Instruction website.  (Google it).

And money is NOT the problem..... As a matter of fact, we spend too much money in education... and it goes to the wrong stuff.... more and more layers of administration and bureaucracy!

But at City Springs, they put their hearts, minds and funds into teachers, kids and supplies.  That's where the payoff is.

I loved this video... and my hat's off to the City Springs folks!",1374969600,,1165,4.78
