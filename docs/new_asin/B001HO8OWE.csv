Yulissa (Claudia Ramirez) is a sweet, virginal schoolgirl who has attracted the attention (and the lust) of the local honcho Ignacio Aguirre (Sergio Goyri). By blackmailing her grandmother, he forces our girl to marry him. This is not an honest and saintly old woman, but one who has lied to her grandchildren, faked ill health and has gone through the family's money, thus putting herself at the villain's mercy.

Our heroine sees her new husband mercilessly beating one of his employees on their wedding day and knows that she will be next. She runs away and seeks shelter at the seacoast, where she is considering suicide. Luis ngel (Luis Jos Santander) a young doctor, saves her from certain death.

We have a vicious, self-centered villain, his greedy (but beautiful) sister, their doting nanny, a crazy bag-woman, and a lusty foreman. And that's just on the ranch.

The villain, played by Sergio Goyri, is overdone as well, though the actor has gone on to many, far more effective roles. This one is too talky, the scenes too lengthy, the heroine too sweet, and the hero is oddly limited: both as an actor and as a character. That being said, you can conclude that I didn't much like this one. My All-Region DVD player from Amazon can handle the Region 4 format, though.",1407542400,,1331,4.724137931034483
