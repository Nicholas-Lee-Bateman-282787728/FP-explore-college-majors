3594102,4,B001G0U2GU,"Now, this is not the actual season one and two you are thinking of.  Yes, you get all the English dubbed episodes of seasons one and two, and they are all legit, don't worry. However. If your like me, you want your anime collection looking all in sequence and nice-like. This duo is not like the other box sets 3-7. They are of a different style, and definitely not as appealing. If all you care about the episodes (which are fantastic) this is perfect for you, it's cheap and you shouldn't have any complaints. InuYasha is a superb show. I would recommend buying this superb show in the single box sets, a little, little, more pricey, but you won't regret it once you get the whole series (which you damn well should). So here you go! I did the work for you.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inuyasha-Season-1/dp/B0002HODKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inuyasha - Season 1</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inuyasha-Season-2/dp/B000ALM4J4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inuyasha - Season 2</a>",1293926400,14,1075,5.98051948051948
3594103,5,B001G0U2GU,"I bought this last week, and the shipping was fast, it got here before the estimated delivery dates. Everything about this is just great, I am a huge fan of the Inuyasha series and I was looking for a great price for it, and I don't think this can be beat. I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes this series or if your just planning on getting it for someone as a gift.",1289520000,4,382,4.1066666666666665
3594104,4,B001G0U2GU,This is a great show and a great product. It was a birthday present for my sister and she loves it.,1252454400,,99,3.761904761904762
8303567,5,B001G0U2GU,it little late but i love inuyasha and and great condition as well,1438473600,,66,4.153846153846154
8303568,5,B001G0U2GU,"Kagome is a normal girl, destiny takes her to feudal Japan where she meets Inuyasha the half demon and together the have to find the Shikon no Tama. Along the way they meet a lot of great characters including the Super villain Naraku. My favorite is Shippo the fox demon. The anime is only in english and some times I like to watch them in thier original language and It doesn't have special features but if what you want is the episodes only its fantastic.",1330387200,,457,4.3882352941176475
8303569,5,B001G0U2GU,"Awesome price! It might not be the original covers, but I'm not too concerned with that. I couldn't beat the price of season 1 and 2 together for such a great price! Well worth it. And the discs play perfectly. There is no cheapness to them. They aren't used. They are brand new (unless you purchased a used set). Can't beat it. Unless you are a serious collector and are more interested in the actual box sets, this is the best deal around.",1325289600,,441,4.325301204819277
8303570,4,B001G0U2GU,"Absolutely cannot beat the price, but my sister and I were slightly disappointed by the lack of subtitles. We are sometimes a little hard of hearing, and we like having subtitles on so we can know what they actually said instead of what we think they said. She was also a little disappointed that the Japanese voices were not available, but for the price we'll get over it. As poor college students, this was definitely the better purchase than the more expensive separate seasons.",1324944000,,481,4.738095238095238
8303571,1,B001G0U2GU,I thought it would be neat owning the american version however it is horrible compared to the voices and talking of the japanese one. Do not waste your money on this like I did just stick with the normal one...,1323388800,,210,4.275
8303572,5,B001G0U2GU,"I'm very pleased with both seasons. It's a terrific show and brings back great memories. As others have pointed out, these are the English TV versions, so they're very basic. The DVD menu literally consist of Play & Scene Selection. No bonus material or options to watch anything other than the English version. which is honestly just fine by me. This is how I seen it first on TV and it's actually slightly nostalgic for me.
Though if you're more of a die-hard fan that enjoys watching it in Japanese or are interested in any bonus content, then I suggest going ahead and springing for the original box sets. :D

But if you're like me and just looking for simple & cheap, this one's definitely a great bang for your buck.",1320710400,6,722,4.511450381679389
8303573,4,B001G0U2GU,"I payed 25 USD for my product, and I must say this is a very good anime set. Anything above 60 USD$ would be ludicrous and not worth it as you could probably find the box sets separate for a cheaper price. But for the price I payed it is very good. Other shows I have had shell out 35 USD$ just for one season. Season One covers episodes 1 through 27. Season Two covers episodes 28-54. It doesn't have many extras, it does include the episode previews at the end of each show, and does not include the Japanese audio therefore I cannot give this item five stars. But this is truly a terrific show and at a price like this it is hard to beat so if your a casual fan such as my self I strongly urge you to pick it up.",1308528000,2,715,3.9379310344827587
8303574,5,B001G0U2GU,"I love love love this show! really good quality, but not in widescreen. Also it is english dubbed and not subtitled so may bother some people who prefer to watch this show in its original Japanese glory, but that wasn't a problem for me as i prefer the english dub ;) would definitely recommend this product to other people!",1306368000,,324,4.508474576271187
8303575,2,B001G0U2GU,"When I made this purchase I was unaware that it was the English TV version, which does not allow you to watch it in Japanese. So now I have to return it. I was so excited to find both seasons for so cheap and no where on your page says it's the english TV version. And of course I can't open it to see if it has Japanese, I had to come on here and research it. So I am extremely dissapointed.",1300665600,3,392,3.792682926829268
8303576,5,B001G0U2GU,"This double pack was not only a great deal financially but the quality was awesome. Everything came prepackaged, unopened, all the disks were there, no scratches and every disk worked perfectly. It was EXACTLY what I wanted....",1294099200,6,227,5.162162162162162
