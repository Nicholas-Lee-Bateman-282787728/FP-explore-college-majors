8759130,5,B01ELKPA2W,"How very remarkable, that this WONDERFUL video, has won the praise of only a single admirer! I find this really fascinating. Joni Mitchell has certainly been one of the most, ( I don't even know how to put it...)OHHH... she has been the single most wonderful influence on my life . Be it musically, spiritually or independently . Knowing the true nature of Joni, coming up in the music industry, and having learned that it was so difficult to find a path TRULY her OWN, and to KEEP to that constant and often rocky path. And so many artists , having that same difficult upbringing in the music industry, faltered, and were swayed.  But how many can say, that they truly carved their path through the stony hearts and minds of the publishing people, and the industry producers that would make life so terribly difficult for a star such as she.
 I admit, that I have written only unintelligible, and really stupid comments here. For certain, I will try again! All I really wanted to say, was, that I admire Joni more than I do ANY other rock artist, musical artist , jazz artist , New Wave musician...and PERSON.  Her breathtaking ability to find a new flow through her music is astonishing, ALWAYS.",1500508800,3,1197,4.610328638497653
