5072810,5,B007ATHNLI,There isn't much I can add to this review that wasn't said by the others who reviewed this. He is genuine & not at all like his 80's persona (although it creeps in every now & then throughout the show) a likable & talented person worthy of viewing multiple times.,1353715200,2,263,4.28
5072811,5,B007ATHNLI,"Awesome video, I've watched it several times and have had friends over to watch it with me. Bobcat is Hilarious. I highly recommend this video!",1350604800,,143,4.76
5072812,5,B007ATHNLI,"Awesome dvd, one of the best stand up discs I own. Also, check out the movies he writes and directs:

SHAKES THE CLOWN
SLEEPING DOGS LIE
WORLD'S GREATEST DAD
GOD BLESS AMERICA",1337472000,,175,4.46875
5072833,5,B007ATHNLI,Bobcat was great. Hilarious!!!,1439078400,,30,6.75
5072834,5,B007ATHNLI,"Bobcat Goldthwait is a uniquely funny and interesting guy, and this stand-up presentation is a great summation of his peculiar career trajectory through multiple genres from the ultra-annoying ""Police Academy"" films through his stints as a well-respected director. Although this show isn't as consistently hilarious as his ultimate stand-up routine, sadly only available in audio only on CD, ""I Don't Mean to Insult You, But You Look Like Bobcat Goldthwait"" (which you should order immediately if you don't have it already), this is still a great representation of Bobcat's live show.

Bobcat doesn't have the smooth delivery and transitions of Jerry Seinfeld or Brian Regan, and some may find his stream-of-consciousness delivery a bit difficult to follow, but I have learned to embrace it and must say that after seeing him live in person he is a true master of adapting content and order of material to the audience at hand. Bobcat doesn't hesitate to mock himself, which is one reason he's so accessible, but manages to bring some big names down to earth in the process as well in a humor style that can't be duplicated: it's manic and at the same time laconic. If you haven't seen Bobcat in a while, give this DVD a try; you'll be glad you did.",1436659200,5,1249,4.863849765258216
5072835,5,B007ATHNLI,Possibly the funniest video I've seen in years !,1420761600,,48,4.444444444444445
5072836,5,B007ATHNLI,Simply hilarious bobcscratch goldfarb!! I love Bobcat and his humor.. Corey,1409961600,,75,5.909090909090909
5072837,5,B007ATHNLI,"Oh, wow.  What a surprise it was to see Bobcat again after all these years.  I was a fan of his weird little self in the 1980s and 1990s.  My bf was watching this special on one of the cable premium channels one night and I came in during the show and ended up sitting on the couch and laughing my ass off.  He recounts some humorous and honest stories with the perfect touch of irreverence and mirth.  It's not politically correct but damn, it's a fun ride.  Especially the airplane ride.  If you're the weird family member who always says the wrong thing at the wrong time, this is the comedy special for you.  Welcome home, my friend.",1395878400,6,637,4.294117647058823
5072838,5,B007ATHNLI,"Bobcat Goldthwait will have you rolling with laughter, this is one of the funniest standup specials I have ever seen.
I watch standup specials on Netflix and only buy them if they are really funny and this standup special is one of the best I have seen.
I would recommend this DVD to everyone. I would also recommend buying Craig Ferguson standup DVD's they are down right funny.
D.L. Hughley standup DVD's are pretty good as well.",1388102400,,431,4.6103896103896105
5072839,4,B007ATHNLI,It's hard to imagine him talking normal instead of his Zed character but he is still funny and  this dvd proves it.,1387152000,,115,4.2272727272727275
5072840,5,B007ATHNLI,I know Bobcat is best known for the Zed style AAAAAAAHHHHH scream but he is truly much more than that. He will make you laugh until your sides hurt from start to finish with his stand up comedy here. And even though none of us look the same you'll still laugh out loud like you did when you were young seen as Zed in the Police Academy Movies and its worth every cent you paid just to even hear the story of the FIRETRUCK. AAA+++,1369180800,2,429,4.0588235294117645
5072841,4,B007ATHNLI,"Gotta love Bobcat!  This is a good show, very entertaining with a number of laugh-out-loud moments.  If you are looking for ""that voice"" and his older material, you won't find much here, but you will find some really good stuff that show that maturity is working for him.",1357171200,,271,4.625
5072842,4,B007ATHNLI,"His current act is definately above the norm.  He seems to still have a sense of humor (that's still funny!)  I appreciate that he's moved with the times . . . directed some movies . . . cut his hair!
No, I'd make it a point to listen.
Also, thank you to AMAZON for hookin' me up for a VERY fair price, and quick shipping!",1356307200,,322,3.9384615384615387
8513567,4,B007ATHNLI,Very Funny.,1509062400,,11,5.0
8513568,5,B007ATHNLI,"Bobcat Goldthwait has grown up and moved beyond his gimmicks of the 90's. This man is so very comfortable on stage and is able to take us from a very serious subject to out loud laughter very quickly. He now has the class of George Carlin or Lewis Black but this is the real man; he's not performing so much as chatting with an audience.

This DVD is wonderful and worth watching over and over. He has aged as we have and matured as we have. His humor is both matured but also self deprecating as he doesn't sly away from his past insanities (setting the Tonight Show set on fire, for example.) by the end he is warm and funny and feels like the guy you'd enjoying having a beer with.",1503532800,,684,4.181818181818182
8513569,5,B007ATHNLI,"Bobcat is absolutely perfect! If you remember his previous material, it's at least at that level. He's matured, and so has his unique sense of humor. However, his true self is also there. Sensitive, caring, totally open minded, outrageous, and just so funny. Wish he was my next door neighbor! The end is perhaps the funniest part, which I won't give away. Buy it. You will truly enjoy it!",1490054400,,389,4.6521739130434785
8513570,1,B007ATHNLI,Mildly funny. Derivative. Washed up old guy.,1484092800,,44,5.428571428571429
8513571,5,B007ATHNLI,Very very funny.,1471564800,,16,4.666666666666667
8513572,5,B007ATHNLI,"It's a softer Bobcat,but no less funny or biting.",1469145600,,49,4.555555555555555
8513573,5,B007ATHNLI,"Yeah, it's funny.",1461456000,,17,5.0
8513574,1,B007ATHNLI,Worst show I have ever seen.  He spent half the show arguing with somebody in the audience and then walked off saying he wouldn't close the show bc of this person,1455580800,,162,4.225806451612903
8513575,5,B007ATHNLI,I loved it.  Much more entertaining than I would have imagined.,1451433600,,63,4.7272727272727275
8513576,5,B007ATHNLI,He may not look the same.  But he's funnier now. Then he ever was before !!!!,1449100800,,77,3.8125
