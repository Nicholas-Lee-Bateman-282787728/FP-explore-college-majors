416380,3,6302035090,"This movie is one hour and twelve minuets long and was released in theaters April 26, 1985. At best the nudity is mild. There are some scenes where the guy fondles the breasts and where the clothes are ripped from the breasts, but no full nudity scenes. The plot is simple. Set in Roman times; Romans sack a village where the prince and princess are to be married that day. The princess survives and sets out with a few of her warriors to retrieve he betrothed. The meet a small village group of resistance fighters and align with the princess to overthrow the evil leader and rescue her future husband. End the end, they overthrow the merciless leader and live happily ever after. The end. Over all it is a pretty lame film with a weak story to it.",1230422400,3,749,4.39568345323741
416381,4,6302035090,"If its the uncut version your after then look for VHS video copies, its not available, or was never put on DVD. The only available versions are the ones that were released by Vestron Video, all the other studios only have the cut version. There was only this one scene that was cut out which lasted about 2 mins and was a torture scene which showed the late  Lana Clarkson tied up to a rack and then scissoring this torturer and pushing him in a vat of acid, and considering the rest of the film features limbs being cut off and breasts bouncing up and down all over the place, why the hell it was cut out is a mystery.

But as i first said the only way of getting the uncut version is looking for a copy for sale that's on VHS tape only (not DVD) and the studio name who released it is Vestron Video. Its rare and not easy to find, but worth owning if you can get it.

416382,2,6302035090,"I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!  Unsatisfied customer.",1042502400,40,629,4.517543859649122
416383,3,6302035090,"There are two forms of the movie on VHS.  The R rated one and the Unrated one.  The DVD is of the R rated version.  The only difference is in the Lana Clarkson bondage scene (which, if you ask me, is the best scene in the movie).  Something is missing in the R rated version.  Benefits to getting the DVD?  Immediately go to your favorite scene.  On top of that, the picture clarity is much MUCH better than your old beat-up tape.
About the movie?  Well, I'm about as big a cinema snob as you can get without being a professional film critic.  I love the classic film-makers.  Kurosawa, Kubrick, Keaton, Ford, Wilder, Hitchcock, etc.  But I really like this movie.  It is one of the best B movies out there.  What's so great about a B movie?  I think it's intent.  B movies are obvious.  They know exactly what they are and what they can do.  They are there for a little action, a little adventure, some blood and guts, some T and A.  They don't try to be anything more than that.  That's why they are my guilty little pleasure.
You want a good B movie?  Get this one, if you can.  But if you have the unrated VHS, you might want to have second thoughts about this purchase.  But then again, it's 10 bucks.  Why not?",1030406400,18,1216,4.213973799126638

7819921,5,6302035090,"What can I say? I saw this movie as a teen in the 80's and fell in love with lana clarkson. When I saw it was on dvd I absolutely had to have it. I don't regret it either. It's actually a great film. It's at most as good as the delaurentis films of that era and at worst as good as the new conan film with mr momoa.
If you love barbarian films of the 80's and you like TnA then this film belongs in your collection.
O the leading ladies do kick ass in this feature. = )",1384300800,3,469,3.7
7819922,3,6302035090,"Barbarian Queen is not the best sword and sorcery film with Roger Corman's name attached to it. As far as I can tell, that would be Deathstalker 2. Still, if it's nudity and violence you want, Barbarian Queen has it. It needed more, though. There are moments where nothing interesting happens, and in a 71 minute b-movie that is unacceptable. But this is a pretty fun movie, overall. It could've been very fun, though.",1334534400,,418,4.662162162162162
7819923,4,6302035090,"In Argentina during 1985, Aires Cinematografica Argentina and Rodeo Products released a 71 minute romp of T & A called ""Barbarian Queen"" with Lana Clarkson, Katt Shea, Dawn Dunlap, Susana Traverso, Andrea Barbieri, Andrea Scriven, Matilde Mur, and Lucy Tiller.  I imagine a few women would enjoy Frank Zagarino in this film, also.  But predominantly, it isn't the sword fighting, it isn't the sets, and it isn't the thespian skills that kept me watching.  The language for the film is English, but that isn't important for this genre.  The story is a raid on a village where survivors are made into slaves, and ultimately back at the castle those slaves and other slaves unite in overthrowing the warlord.  There's raping and pillaging, and some hut burning too.  Lana Clarkson has appeared in many TV hits of the 1970's and 1980's, as well as her fair share of movies.  I like her best in this R-rated film for obvious reasons, as the ""Barbarian Queen.""  Some of the gore and some of the exploitation has been edited, but there's enough here to be worth having.",1332720000,5,1062,4.7650273224043715
7819924,4,6302035090,This was the first of the two Barbarian Queen movies that I saw.  I was not disappointed by either one.  In fact I ordered the second movie after seeing this one.  Please see my review on Barbarian Queen  - the Empress Strikes Back.  Watch both and have fun.,1320192000,3,258,4.291666666666667
7819925,3,6302035090,"Lana clarkson always gave it her all in any movie she was in.  This is not a great movie but a acceptable low budget sword and sorcery movie.
The print looks half way decent too.  Sadly Lana was murdered by Phil Spector the music producer (he was convicted of it too) and is no longer with us; but her earnest performances in this and other low budget movies still survive.  She had enough talent to make this seem like it was more important than it was and she will be missed.",1241222400,2,477,4.21978021978022
