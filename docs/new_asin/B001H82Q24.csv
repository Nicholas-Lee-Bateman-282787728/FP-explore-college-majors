8566288,3,B001H82Q24,Interesting film footage but very choppy editing and not at all what i was expecting.  It's like they took 30 seconds of a bunch of different news reels and put them together.,1527120000,,175,4.46875
8566289,5,B001H82Q24,"I chose the highest rating for this movie because it was an excellent account to the amazing Marines who fought in the Korean War & Chosin Reservoir to Hungnam.  These men fought under inhuman conditions, without proper clothing for the weather conditions.  I am proud to say my Father was a Marine in Korea & the Chosin Reservoir to Hungnam.  We should never forget what our brave men did for the people of Korea.",1388361600,,414,4.5675675675675675
