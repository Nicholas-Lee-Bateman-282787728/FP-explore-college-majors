8557059,3,B00ARVRCKS,"Apache Ambush (1955) isn't really a very good movie, since it isn't focused enough into performing as a solid scripted Western.  I noticed that it re-used a lot of scenes from other Westerns movies, especial, I noticed Arizona (1940) with William Holden.  There's two exciting, but dumb (on the Apaches part) attacks.  They are fast paced and tightly edited, but very grainy and old.  It was obvious that they were making a quick Western and didn't really care about much else.

Apache Ambush has a few USA soldiers that are instructed by President Lincoln to haul cattle shipments from Texas to the North.  They run into problems with a Mexican bandido, who has with him many Apaches for any attack.  Look for ""Iron Eyes Cody"" as an Apache Chief.  A young Richard Jaeckel is also included as a one-arm ex-Confederate States of America soldier, who's a bit of a traitor still.

It didn't really work out very well, but it's not horrible either.  One scene that was hilarious was when someone threw a stick of TNT into the Mexican bandido group and a superimposed special effect created an explosion.  It was actually pretty neat looking.",1451952000,,1137,4.779487179487179

8557065,4,B00ARVRCKS,"Long on my wanted list, this Sony Choice Collection from Columbia does not let me down. An excellent wide screen B/W print means good value (but it is a bit expensive), and the plot about a Presidential ordered Cattle Drive from South to North moves at a frantic pace as directed by the reliable Fred F. Sears. The cast is a good ""Western"" one - Led by Williams, with Ray Teal, Don Harvey, Richard Jaeckel in good roles with a support cast of (unbilled) Clay Moore, George Keymas, Chris Alcaide, Lane Chandler, and.. Tex Ritter in a ""blink and you will miss him"" thankless role, and Ray Corrigan, and I am ashamed to say..I still don't know what part he played!!. My one slight quarrel is that you must forget/overlook the fact that most, tho not all, of the action scenes are stock footage from... Ah that's the question...Is it Jon Hall's ""Kit Carson""? If anyone knows... I loved this good old unpretentious ""B"" Western. I just can't quite manage 5 stars, but very nearly. Western lovers - you can't go wrong with this one. Recomended.",1361750400,6,1037,4.580645161290323
