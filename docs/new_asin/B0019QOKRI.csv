3443210,5,B0019QOKRI,Finally!  The Pilot episode is never shown anywhere.  So glad I found and bought it.  I like Lewis better than Morse....a lot better.,1487462400,,133,4.695652173913044
3443211,4,B0019QOKRI,"Inspector Lewis started out as the down-to-earth, working-class foil for the cultured Detective Inspector Morse. After all, every Holmes needs his Watson.

But when the main detective is removed, can his sidekick become a detective in his own right?  ""Inspector Lewis: The Pilot and Complete 1st Series"" demonstrated quickly that yes, he can -- at least if you give him a well-educated, reserved guy to serve as HIS sidekick, a dynamic that keeps the spinoff from feeling too much like a copy of its predecessor. Instead you get solid mysteries in Oxford, with murderous motives both passionate and intellectual.

After two years in the British Virgin Islands, Detective Inspector Lewis (Kevin Whately) returns to Oxford, and immediately becomes intrigued by the shooting of a young woman participating in a sleep study. The most likely suspect seems to be an erratic, wealthy young student (Charlie Cox) who shortly turns up dead himself -- seemingly the ideal suspect. But with the assistance of the quiet, moody DS Hathaway (Laurence Fox), Lewis is determined to find the real culprit.

In ""Whom the Gods Would Destroy,"" the two men investigate the murder of an Oxford Dean and discovers that he was once part of an elite club called the Sons of the Twice Born. The men involved deny that they were ever involved -- but when a second corpse crops up, Lewis and Hathaway discover that the current murders may be linked to a long-unsolved cold case.

In ""Old School Ties,"" Lewis is called on to play bodyguard to a Nicky Turnbull, a ""rock star hacker"" who has a new bestselling book after being released from prison. However, his job is further complicated when the corpse of a student -- a member of Turnbull's reception committee -- is found strangled near his room, and then Turnbull himself is shot to death.

Finally, ""Expiation"" sees a well-to-do Summertown housewife seemingly having hanged herself, despite having a loving husband, adorable children and a wide circle of friends. Lewis doesn't believe it was suicide, but the only way to uncover evidence to support that is to fulfill the last wishes of a dying Oxford professor. To make matters even worse, he discovers romantic rearrangement and a dark secret that might have inspired her murder...

Considering it's the spinoff/sequel of a long-running series, the first season of ""Inspector Lewis"" is actually a rather smooth, seamless transition. There are a few mentions of Morse in the first two episodes, and hints that he was in some way investigating a suspicious death, but it's made very clear that the spotlight is on Lewis. Furthermore, the dynamic has been flipped -- the cultured, educated man is the sidekick to the working-class Geordie -- and it gives the story a fresh feel.

And the murder mysteries are thoroughly solid affairs -- many of the corpses seem to be suicides or straightforward homicides. But with a little digging or a few clues, they're revealed to actually be more complex and typically someone that you wouldn't initially suspect. Furthermore, the writers wove in some highbrow material worthy of Oxford (perfect numbers, ""Hamlet,"" and so on), but not in a way that takes away from Lewis' unpretentious approach to law enforcement.

Kevin Whately gives a stellar performance as Morse, a good down-to-earth copper who is still grieving the senseless death of his beloved wife (""Sometimes people do just die...""), which has colored his view of everything in the world. Fox's Hathaway seems to be Lewis' opposite in every way -- religious, moody, reserved and rather dry in his humor -- which causes some tension but allows for a good odd-couple dynamic.

Those seeking British murder mysteries can't do much better than ""Inspector Lewis: The Pilot and Complete 1st Series,"" even if they're not familiar with the Inspector Morse mysteries. The best way to attend Oxford: no exams, and lots of murder.",1484006400,,3894,5.013931888544891

3443216,1,B0019QOKRI,"This is still NOT the UK version. I ordered this in September 2016, wanting to see the UK version from the start, and these are USA version, 84-minute episodes, while the original UK version is 93 minutes per episode.  I have written to Amazon to ask them to take off the description of ""Official UK version"" that is on the product website.  Very disappointing, and I have Prime, so I can already view the shortened versions there.",1473897600,,431,4.584415584415584
3443217,4,B0019QOKRI,The only version of the series Pilot I could find anywhere. I had trouble getting the captions to work even though I have a fairly new smart TV. Might have been better otherwise. Love the Lewis series!,1473811200,,201,4.45945945945946

3443222,5,B0019QOKRI,"These are absolutely first-rate British crime dramas.  Intelligent, well-plotted stories; spot-on quality acting by people who look like real people, and not Hollywood cuties; well-developed characters and excellent chemistry between the principals.  The Oxford settings are almost as good as being there in person.  They follow the ""Inspector Morse"" series; the long-suffering Sergeant Lewis has now made it to the rank of inspector, and he has scars from his own tragic backstory.  He treats his sergeant (a fascinating and complex character in his own right) better than he himself was treated by Morse.  What makes this series even better than the earlier one is that there are subtitles for us Americans who may be hard of hearing and a bit unfamiliar with the  ""received pronunciation"" of the toffs and profs and the dialect of the humbler folk.  For years I rented the disks from Netlix and decided that I want them for my own.  I'm watching the earlier ones for the third time now, and they have not lost their sparkle.",1454284800,,1027,4.964912280701754

3443236,5,B0019QOKRI,This was a gift but my friend was nice enough to invite me to watch a program with her and we both enjoyed it immensely. I knew that she was a big fan of Inspector Lewis so when I saw that the pilot and first season were available I knew it was the perfect gift for her. She loves it and it arrived in a very timely manner and conveniently packaged for holiday gifting. I can't recommend it enough for someone who is a fan of the BBC mysteries.,1419811200,,444,4.0

3443243,5,B0019QOKRI,"Certainly one of our favorite series. Always so sorry that the Brits only do a couple of episodes for each ""season"". Of course, it's better to have 5 fantastic episodes than 10 mediocre ones, but always hate when the series ends. Inspector Lewis is well written and great mystery. I hope they decide to do more.",1410220800,,311,4.571428571428571

3443249,5,B0019QOKRI,"I bought this just for the pilot since the others are available on streaming services or iTunes. After watching all of the Morris seasons, there was really something missing between the last Morris and the first episode of Lewis. I felt like an important piece of the story was missing. Watching the pilot, which is so good, really makes the transition from the Morris seasons to the Lewis series much more engaging. It was definitely worth the money just for the pilot.",1406937600,,470,4.7439024390243905

3443251,5,B0019QOKRI,Great quality!  This fills the missing pieces about Inspector Lewis after the death of Morse and his wife.  Of course it changes him from easy going and cheerful  to cynical and grumpy.  I missed the pilot show when it first appeared on PBS.,1405900800,,241,4.534883720930233

These tales are enhanced by Lewis's sidekick, the brilliant and shy Hathaway, in a relationship that's as interesting as the earlier one without the toxicity.  Also fascinating are the wonderful Claire Holman and Rebecca Front as ""Oxford's best.""",1402790400,,342,5.433962264150943

3443255,5,B0019QOKRI,"I gave this five starts tho in reality , i would probably have given it 4.5, because the first program has to set up all the characters and I thought was not quite as good as the other programs. That being said this is one of my favorite series. The writing is topnotch and the two main characters play so well off of each other that I hope I will be writing reviews of season 25. The setting is what puts this series over the top for me. It is set in Oxford. The interplay with the police and the students .professors and even some of the help who seem to think they are far above them make for great drama and comedy. If you want a mystery show with great writing , terrific actors,plots that make you think and go to an encyclopedia from time to time, and a setting that I do not think can be topped this is the show for you.",1400457600,,828,4.024242424242424

3443257,3,B0019QOKRI,Enjoyable. If you like such type of comical detective stories. Set in very modern situations. Sometimes slapstick. Reminds you of Laurel and Hardy.,1398470400,,147,5.434782608695652
3443258,5,B0019QOKRI,"I have long been a fan of Inspector Morse but only recently stumbled across the Inspector Lewis series.  If anything, I like it even better. The parts of Morse that I did not like, particularly his sexism and his behavior towards Lewis and others, is gone here.  Lewis and Hathaway make a great team, even when they disagree. They're very different types and as Lewis says in one episode, the two of them together make a pretty good detective.  The Oxford setting is still gorgeous too and a character in its own right.",1398297600,,519,4.559139784946237
3443259,5,B0019QOKRI,What can't you say about this duo.  It was a great pairing for the Inspector Lewis series.  I have loved and watched this series since it was on PBS.  I plan on purchasing the complete series.,1395532800,,192,4.277777777777778
3443260,5,B0019QOKRI,After watching all the inspector Morse movies we were really pleased to see a series starring Lewis. The mix of personal and working lives of the characters make for interesting plot lines. Kevin Whately and Lawrence Fox are excellent in their roles.,1394841600,,250,4.976190476190476
3443261,5,B0019QOKRI,"Let's face it. If you are a true Anglophile, you'll check out anything British. This series is a beautifully acted and directed series of mysteries, rich with character and meaning. It picks up wonderfully from the Morse series and if I may say so, improves upon it. While I love my MIdsommer Murders (as I do my old Murder, She Wrote), this series is much chewier and poetic.",1386374400,,376,4.544117647058823
3443262,4,B0019QOKRI,"I love the plots. Mr Fox, like all Brits, tends not to open his mouth when speaking. For some reason Brits tend to speak not moving their jaw. I hope the series has not ended.",1383955200,,175,4.0285714285714285
3443263,4,B0019QOKRI,"I liked it but not wildly.  It is very similar to other detective stories with no outstanding merits.  The acting is good but I was not
excited by the stories.",1383264000,,159,4.266666666666667

3443265,5,B0019QOKRI,"The Lewis series is a ""must have"" for anyone who likes the Inspector Morse stories, or anyone who really loves character and plot-driven mysteries.  The writing is top notch, and the casting couldn't be better.  An A+ winner!",1378598400,,225,4.894736842105263

3443267,4,B0019QOKRI,"The pilot and series one are slow starters. If this is all you've seen you may not enjoy the series as one should. Hathaway, Lewis' younger sidekick, is much like a young Morse. Well, not like the Morse of the ""Endevor"" series, but as one might imagine Morse was like as a younger person. His dialogue is written well and quite pithy. He was educated at Cambridge, a theology student, and then joined the police force. We were really quite sad when the series ended. We think the supporting cast is quite good and Lewis' romance nice without being too juicy. Really, see the rest of this series first and then come back when you might enjoy this one.",1376784000,,650,4.470588235294118
3443268,5,B0019QOKRI,It was a god buy and has given my Mom and I many hours of enjoyment.  It was in good shape and was very easy to order.,1376524800,,118,3.3703703703703702
3443269,3,B0019QOKRI,"I quite like British mysteries, usually, and though I never watched Inspector Morse, I was pleased to get this set as a gift.  The acting is generally quite good, and it was a treat to see Gina McKee--quite a wonderful actress--in one of the episodes (in looking her up online, I discovered that one of her first TV appearances as her career was beginning was in an Inspector Morse episode).  I like the interaction between Lewis and his assistant Hathaway, who is a quite interesting character.

What I don't like about the series, and what in fact began to grate on me through the episodes, is its depiction of the faculty and students at Oxford.  Since they're all figuring in murder investigations, I suppose it's to be expected that they not always be nice, but the non-stop run of professors who are loathsome, pompous, immoral, and criminal is only equalled by the series of students who are narcissistic, venal, and, at their best, victimized by the loathsome professors.  Somehow I imagine that there are actually quite a few professors at Oxford who love their studies and inspire their students, and I imagine that there are students who love their academic work and find professors who mentor them.  This series could badly do with a portrayal of scholarship that doesn't make it a freak show.  Maybe later series have done better, but this one left a sour taste and I don't think I'll be watching more.",1375315200,,1415,4.751020408163265
3443270,5,B0019QOKRI,I love watching a good detective series where there isn't a lot gun play and gore as there is in the US programs.  It's nice to sit back and use your brain to solve a mystery.,1373846400,,175,3.861111111111111

3443272,5,B0019QOKRI,Inspector Lewis a reasonable character with a remarkable partner. Like this better than the Morse series. If Lewis retires we would like to see Hathaway become a series.,1368403200,,169,5.071428571428571
3443273,5,B0019QOKRI,Mr. Morse  would be proud of his protege. And Laurence superb actor. Pleasing to the eyes. Its about time that we have someone who was born in the seventies that can act. They work well together.,1368316800,,195,4.416666666666667
3443274,3,B0019QOKRI,Even the Morse episodes were slow moving.  These are molasses.  The only person with any charisma is the DS.  Perhaps they will spin a series off on him.,1366761600,,153,4.392857142857143

Accomplished actor and interesting character.",1366156800,,356,5.086206896551724
3443276,5,B0019QOKRI,I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the British crime drama/mystery shows. Very good casting and writing. I also love the scenery.,1365984000,,145,5.083333333333333

3443279,5,B0019QOKRI,I have several years worth of this series.  I love the characters.  You can watch them more than once and see new things in each episode.  I fell in love with the characters when PBS aired this series and knew I had to own them.  The age difference between the two main characters make this series interesting.  They are dignified characters who grow on you the more you watch them.,1361318400,,382,4.4

I have watched the show on the Knowledge network and it is a good show but this product is useless to me. I have heard other bad reports of products from Masterpiece Mystery and evidently they have the only legal right to record these shows for us.

3443283,5,B0019QOKRI,"These stories are really well-written and keeps the watcher riveted to the TV!  I am buying the whole series bit by bit and I appreciate being able to get these great British stories.  There's a lot ot appreciate about the series but one of the best parts (besides Lewis, Hathway and Dr Hobson) is the setting - Oxford and the lovely river.  The dramas are believeable, the locations are fascinating and I LOVE them!  Keep them coming. Please.",1349481600,,443,4.641025641025641
3443284,5,B0019QOKRI,"First: a confession. I've never watched a single episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morse/dp/B0028LOT7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morse</a>, and so I came into this series knowing only that it was the successor to a popular detective show in which its titular character's sergeant is now an inspector, taking the central role with a sergeant of his own.

As detectives go, Robert Lewis isn't exactly a standout in his field. Not a genius like Sherlock or Poirot, not an acclaimed professional like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frost/dp/B00016MSSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frost</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tennison/dp/B0028AEO0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tennison</a>, and not part of a dream-team odd couple like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lynley-and-Havers/dp/B001D7T6N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lynley and Havers</a>, he is most akin to Barnaby of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsummer-Murders/dp/B002S4AN2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsummer Murders</a>&nbsp;when it comes to British detective dramas. This is a man who achieves results through hard work, thoroughness, and by-the-book police procedure. A dogged worker who is not particularly brilliant or charismatic, and who carries with him a permanent air of loneliness thanks to the death of his wife in a hit-and-run accident. He's a surprising change from the usual police detective in these types of dramas: a man that *isn't* more eccentric than the criminals he puts behind bars. Backing him up is the laconic, implacable and somewhat enigmatic Sergeant Hathaway, providing a clear contrast to the more hot-headed Lewis. Where Lewis is an atheist, Hathaway is spiritual, where Lewis is quick to anger, Hathaway is unflappable, where Lewis provides experience, Hathaway is always ready to explain any scholarly references that might pop up.

They make a good team, though an oddly detached one. They don't have much in common, they seldom confide in each other about personal matters, and it's difficult to imagine them socializing much outside of work - theirs is a cool but complementary friendship. Those viewers who go in search of ""bromances"" may find little to excite them here, but again, this distinction is part of the show's charm. These men are opposites in personalities, yet equally committed to whatever task is put before them.

Also on board is Superintendent Jean Innocent, who oversees all of Lewis's cases (and who butts heads with him on more than one occasion), and Doctor Laura Hobson, the coroner. Each provides a dose of estrogen to the cast, and in the latter case, a possible love interest to Lewis.

In the pilot episode (simply called ""Lewis,"" on the DVD menu) a vivacious American student is found dead in a sleep laboratory, shot to death in one of the sound-proof rooms. All the clues point to her boyfriend Danny Griffon, a young man who is dealing with family problems straight out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamlet/dp/1613820917/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamlet</a>. He insists that his father's fatal car accident was the work of his uncle, now in charge of the car company and in a relationship with his mother, and that his girlfriend's death is his uncle trying to frame him for murder. It sounds too extraordinary for Lewis's down-to-earth tastes, but perhaps Morse himself might have the answers in his old notes.

This is a great beginning for the series, showcasing the distinct strengths of both Lewis and Hathaway, and involving a very clever mystery that is based at least partially on ""Hamlet"" (or is it...?) Right from the start, the show displays its strengths: smooth pacing, interesting suspects, and subtle little hints strewn throughout the episode that only gain their full meaning on second viewing.

In ""Whom the Gods Must Destroy,"" a man is found bashed to death outside his boathouse. Soon Lewis and Hathaway suspect the death had something to do with an old Oxford society: four men who called themselves ""the sons of the twice-born"", a reference to Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and revelries. With each one receiving mysterious phone-calls from a woman calling herself ""Fury"", it seems clear that they are involved somehow, and Lewis realizes that the best way of finding the truth is to play off each man's insecurities and idiosyncrasies.

Possibly the best of the four mysteries, this one deals with an old crime that gradually comes to light as the investigation wears on, and which initiates extensive use of psychology in the way Lewis approaches each suspect and demands, eases or tricks information out of them.

""Old School Ties"" concerns a convict-turned-author's arrival in Oxford to speak to a student group, who is offered police protection due to death threats surrounding the publication of his latest book. Lewis and Hathaway find themselves roped in as bodyguards to the rather swaggering Nicky Turnball, who soon admits that the entire thing was just a publicity stunt. But then why is it that a student is found dead in the hotel room just next-door to his?

This one is a bit slow, with a lot of set-up and a fair bit of padding. By far the most interesting characters are the ambitious and amoral students that invite Turnball to Oxford for ulterior motives of their own, but in the second half of the episode Turnball's wife turns up, and it suddenly grows more interested in exploring her past relationship with Lewis than it does trying to solve the actual mystery.

Finally, ""Expiation"" takes a turn away from academia to focus on a more domestic drama. A housewife hangs herself in her own home, much to the utter bewilderment of her friends and family, who believed her to have the perfect life: devoted husband, beautiful children and adoring friends. Though Lewis is urged to drop the case, he can't help but feel that something is wrong - if Rachel Mallory committed suicide, then why didn't she leave a note? And why didn't she remove her wedding ring?

Probably the darkest of the four episodes (and that's saying a lot considering the content of the average murder mystery!) this one is involved with dark family secrets and deeply troubled individuals. Though it tries to off-set some of the darkness with Lewis's struggles in dealing with public speaking, it's still a rather haunting episode that provides no clear resolution to some of the dilemmas that it raises.

Though I can't comment on the quality of the American DVDs (according to other reviews, it would appear that at least ten minutes have been cut out of each episode, so perhaps it's advisable to purchase the UK editions and watch on a multi-regional player) I can attest as to the value of the show itself. Taking full advantage of its beautiful Oxford setting, the show is beautifully shot in and around the universities and riversides, providing plenty of scenery porn and impetus to visit the place yourself. The mysteries themselves are gently paced, and the viewer gets few clues that are not gathered by Lewis and Hathaway themselves (few things are more annoying than the viewer figuring out the mystery before the detectives simply because the show has revealed too much to them). And Lewis and Hathaway themselves make for enjoyable detectives - not only their droll banter, but the fact that they're both decent, intelligent men.

Basically: great stories, likeable protagonists, and a beautiful setting. That's all I want in a mystery series.",1347148800,,7692,5.525063721325403

3443296,4,B0019QOKRI,"If you were (are) a fan of the Inspector Morse series, you should enjoy this continuation of Oxford based mysteries.  While Robby Lewis is no Morse, and never claims to be, his younger and somewhat enigmatic partner can provide the Biblical and literary quotations, the musical references, and the sense of a refined intellect to go along with Lewis' 'cop' instincts and dogged determination, in order to solve their cases.  They both have a 'Frost-like' relationship with their female superior that is much more confrontational than what we saw in the Morse years, but overall the look and feel of the series, the locations, the other characters, and indeed the plots themselves are very Morse-like.  I personally like that the episodes are only 90 minutes long.  That is enough to fully develop the plot without dragging as there is a strong tendency to do in British mysteries (the P.D.James episodes especially).  I was late to this party, thinking this would be a 'cheap' knock off and a detriment to the Morse legacy, but can now say that I am genuinely enjoying this series--watching Series Two now.",1265846400,,1106,4.924731182795699

3443305,1,B0019QOKRI,"We fans in North America have been duped by PBS video! It was bad enough that we endure a lazy DVD production that is 2 years behind what's available in the UK and simply applies the ""Masterpiece Mystery"" broadcast version of the show onto video. That is to say, one must endure annoying PBS ads; a superficial intro by host Alan Cumming; an unacceptable preview that spoils some surprises for anyone hoping to enjoy the episode freshly; and a cruel removal of Barrington Pheloung's end credit theme music for the show, which I've therefore never heard.

HOWEVER, each of these episodes is missing about 10 minutes of story that has been edited out so that PBS can air the show in its 90 minute time slot. I found this out when I realized that my ""Inspector Morse"" DVDs released by Carleton Video always ran about 1 hour and 34 minutes, and asked PBS if ""Lewis"" should really be longer than the DVDs' 1 hour and 24 minutes. They had the courtesy to admit the truth. Why it's necessary for PBS (which has long publicized itself as commercial free) to edit out 10 instead of 3 minutes is beyond me, but we're missing out on details and texture in the story telling that is available to UK viewers and DVD buyers.

It is one thing if PBS decided to do this for its on-air version, but Shop PBS hasn't had the decency to restore the original footage back into the DVD release; even more supposedly commercial studios like Fox Home Video treat fans better than this!  Yet, what's especially unacceptable about all this is that PBS has made it impossible for a more considerate and honest company like Carleton Video to do the program justice by releasing the full versions of the episodes. This is because, according to ITV America, PBS has acquired exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute the DVDs in North America. So, PBS hasn't just released a bad product for fans of the show, but has prevented other companies from doing a better job. What disgusting and monopolistic behavior for an entity officially dedicated to serving the public. When it comes to Inspector Lewis, it has carried out a willful public disservice!

I ask all ""Inspector Lewis"" fans to protest to WGBH PBS (feedback@wgbh.org) and to write to ITV.",1249171200,,2222,4.675191815856778

The Lewis character had already developed very nicely within the original Morse series, so there was certainly enough to work with for the new one... but this series is more than just a Morse spin-off; it is outstanding in its own right. Kevin Whately does a fantastic job of taking on the role of lead detective, and Laurence Fox is an excellent and very interesting addition as DS Hathaway. There's a Morse feeling to the series, but I think we'll see it develop into something all of its own. I can't wait for more!",1244505600,,751,4.410071942446043
3443307,4,B0019QOKRI,"As a fan of Inspector Morse, I was very eager to watch this new series starring Morse's former partner, and I'm pleased to say that it met my expectations, if not exceeded them. The new Lewis is not quite as we remember him. In the Morse series, it was always Morse himself that we loved, but it was Lewis we liked and identified with, for his boldness, his sense of humor, and his strong sense of right and wrong. The new Lewis is older and world-weary, carrying the burden of his wife's hit-and-run death, a thing that has made him more cynical and blurred the lines of his ethics somewhat. All of this makes him interesting, of course, and Kevin Whately does a magnificent job of portraying this new Lewis while still giving us glimpses of the old Lewis we know and love - it all feels very genuine. During the pilot there were even times that I teared up just watching him, because he seemed so sad.

The pilot was probably the best episode of the four that are included in this set, although each of them has merits that set it apart. I very much liked the ""clue"" left behind by Morse in the pilot - you could almost feel his presence.

The fourth episode, Expiation, was actually a bit of a quandary for me. The story itself was extremely flimsy - even laughable - to the extent that I wondered how it could have gotten past whatever quality controls are in place. But in some ways it was the best, as it was, in my opinion, the first really good episode for Hathaway, and the first time the Lewis/Hathaway dynamic really began to gel. Hathaway has the potential to be a great character, but so far the series has been very Lewis-centric, which is great for those of us who have known and loved him since the late 80's, but if the show is going to be successful on its own, rather than clinging to the coat-tails of Inspector Morse, then Hathaway needs to develop as much of an identity in the series as Lewis had in the original. Happily, episode four left me satisfied that this will happen.

I felt that this series, as much as I enjoyed it, wouldn't necessarily have anything to set it apart from the sea of other British detective/murder mystery series if the viewer wasn't already familiar with Lewis. Morse was superb in every way - and Lewis has the potential to be, but it needs to find a greatness of its own. Its best bet for doing so is to delve deeper into the characters of Lewis and Hathaway and solidify their unique partnership. I think it's heading in that direction, and I can't wait to see series 2!

Kevin Whately (of course) and Laurence Fox are both outstanding, and Morse fans will be very pleased to see the return of Clare Holman as pathologist Dr. Hobson. The series is beautifully filmed, and the original music by Morse composer Barrington Pheloung is fantastic. Unfortunately the DVDs are a bit grainy, and the region 1 DVDs are edited down to 90 minutes (booo!!!!).

Overall, a great start to a very promising series that has left me wanting more. Recommended.",1236384000,,2997,4.461678832116788

I thought the pilot was very good and when we finally got a follow-up I made sure that I set my recorder to capture it. To my great dismay I found the first two episodes impossible to watch because of the incessant, inane music, mixed way too loud,  that accompanied virtually every scene.  It got so annoying that we couldn't get through an entire episode. I'm not sure if this is surprising or not. The music in many of the British mystery series has been on a downward slope - from the absolute high of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Homes series (composer: Patrick Gowers) - for some time. The Morse series was quite good as was Poirot. Not so for Inspector Lewis. It sounds like a kid playing with his synthesizer.

For those of us who were Inspector Morse fans for years it is great to catch up with Lewis. The filming of this is as before a visual treat. The upper class bad guys are great to see. Everyone is so rather polite and nice when first met that one cannot believe what a mess is their private lives. The superintendent Strange has been replaced with one who is Innocent and a woman.
 Lewis is still his down to earth self, but much sadder as his wife has been killed in an hit-an-run. He seems to have returned with some of his mentors habits: making his Sargent drink the orange juice while he has a pint, telling interviewees that it's too bad they must be interrupted but this is a murder investigation after all, and listening to and enjoying classical music. The new Sargent is the educated one. I wonder if he could become a ""Morse"" character as he ages. He might learn some of Morse style behaviors from Lewis.

Fox is sleek as an otter, playing a Cambridge man, an ex-theology student who plays medieval instruments set to contemporary jazz. It's almost a chick lit dream come true.

3443315,5,B0019QOKRI,"I suppose that Inspector Lewis will always be linked to Morse, not a bad thing as that series was brilliant, as were the actors! John Thaw and Kevin Whately made a series believable and never made an character mistake! It was not seen to be acting, they had become the people you knew and trusted.
Now Kevin Whately (DI Lewis)picking up his life after such personal tragedy, and Laurence Fox (DS Hathaway)giving his own stamp on this charming and very likable, though sensitive character, are just right to carry Thames Valley Police and Oxford into this series for a long and gripping run.
An older Lewis is a humble, dedicated man with intense sympathy for the victim. Hathaway has respect for Lewis; though you cannot (see) all of this young man's character at once, you realize that he will support Lewis no matter what!
I am now looking forward to the next releases of ""Inspector Lewis"" and I will continue to collect this series",1222128000,,934,4.701219512195122
3443316,5,B0019QOKRI,"I was and still am a big Morse fan (I bought all of the DVDs when they were $20.00 a pop each). I was really happy to see and buy the Lewis pilot when it first came out and hoped that more episodes would follow. Sooo, It was fantastic when they followed up with the subsequent episodes. They are fantastic. I can't wait for more.

For anyone who is a Morse fan, you will love the relationship between Lewis and Hathaway. The main difference I see is that Lewis is softer and less self absorbed than Morse. Morse was a genius but he acted like the world and Sgt Lewis centered around him. Lewis treats his underling more like a person and he respects his input. I really like this aspect of the show.",1220832000,,699,4.2164179104477615
3443317,5,B0019QOKRI,"More and more great british tv series are making it over here to region one dvd release and that is a great thing.  murder city, blue murder, waking the dead, rebus, touch of frost are now out on dvd in the states.
But the most popular of them all was inspector morse and all the episodes are out on dvd in our region.  This is the followup series that takes place after the death of inspector morse. John thaw the great actor who played him also died unfortunately.  The series is better than the inspector lewis single movie which serves as the pilot here. And that was produced in 2006 and is available as a single disc. make sure you don't buy that one as you get the same movie as the pilot episode here.
the set includes the pilot and three great inspector lewis mystery episodes. the pilot was from 2006 and the first series from 2007.  In 2008 they made 4 more episodes that will be set 2. Let's hope they continue to make the show for years to come as well.  But if you love a good mystery then this series is well worth your time.",1220659200,,1040,4.206030150753769

But this promises to be as good as MORSE, but then after all he was Lewis' mentor!!!!
The pairing with Hathaway is excellent, it's a bit reminiscent of some of the exchanges Morse and Lewis had. Just that now Hathaway is the scholar, anyway I could just go on and on.... get the DVD, you will be happy you did!!!",1218499200,,465,4.235955056179775
3443319,5,B0019QOKRI,"A big fan of the Morse mysteries, both videos and books, I was really pleased when the Inspector Lewis series began and I hope there will be more. Who knew Lewis had so much personality? Totally enjoyable. And his partner Hathaway has some depth, too. A terrifically entertaining series.",1215993600,,287,4.877551020408164
3443320,5,B0019QOKRI,"I have just seen the pilot and three episodes of ""Inspector Lewis"", which I assume comprise this DVD, on my local PBS station and am already considering buying the DVD.  Like so many, I was a huge ""Morse"" fan and have been surprised and delighted at the wonderful job that has been done in developing the ""Lewis"" sequel.  The development of the aging Lewis is compelling and believable; the relationship with his new, younger partner, Hathaway, promises to be as rich as that of Lewis and Morse.  It's not that often that a ""spinoff"" or follow-up is as good as ""Inspector Lewis"" promises to be.  I only hope that there are more to come.",1215734400,,636,4.552631578947368

8275031,5,B0019QOKRI,"Detective Inspector Morse was such a figure in the annuals of Masterpiece Theatre, particularly the Mystery Division. Since his death, DS Lewis his partner has gone through one crisis after another. His wife was killed, his partner died, but on the bright side he was promoted to DI. He is still with the Thames Valley Police Department, and  their turf is still Oxford. His new partner is a junior partner, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox,  who is the epitome of DI Morse! They have the same sort of class rivalry, but it is upended.

In this series, they deal with altered identities and crimes of retribution. DI Lewis is still having difficulty dealing with his wife's unsolved murder, so this is s 'come to momma' series. DS Lewis is much darker and his life is more complicated than the more frivolous Lewis we knew of yore. The murders in this series are incredibly complex, the stories much more updated and modern. DS Hathaway is from public school and Cambridge, so he seems to fit right in with the characters in these episodes. He smokes, was an athlete and once studied for the priesthood. He is tightly controlled , and he does not reveal much if anything of his background.

DI Lewis and DS Hathaway are the epitome of opposites attract, and they make the best pair of detectives. Masterpiece is known as giving us the best in performances, and once again, they deliver!

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-17-17",1489708800,,1445,4.764
