8589366,4,B000007QTV,"Two Brigitte Bardot movies (on one DVD) at a very affordable price!  I'm happy, but here's the scoop on the DVD: (1) both ""Caroline and the Rebels"" and ""And God Created Woman"" are dubbed in English  versions of the movies  (2) the picture/audio quality of both movies is  mediocre at best (both videos are in color but look kind of hazy, washed  out; the audio on ""Caroline"" has some static and the audio on  ""And God Created Woman"" is clear and loud).
Bottom line:  I'm  NOT complaining.  At this price, this DVD is a bargain.  (I happen to like  dubbed foreign movies--I hate reading subtitles on my small tv screen).  Until another company releases pristine versions of these films, this DVD  is just fine.",954806400,25,709,4.620967741935484
