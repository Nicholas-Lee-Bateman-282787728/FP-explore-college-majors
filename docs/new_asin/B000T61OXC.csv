A bunch of olde time strongmen, their friends and family got together for a picnic and some feats peaof strength.  Don't get them confuse with competitors of the sport of strongman.  Not to say that they're not strong, because they are. It's just that their FEATS are geared more towards entertainment.  Example:  You have to be strong to tear a deck of cards but you don't have to tear a deck of cards to be strong.  It's something that most people would have to train for to be able to do.

That leads to the matter of practicality.  These men do a lot of very impressive feats, but most of it I could never see 90% of the population doing.  Another example: How many people would ever need to bend a metal bar in their mouth or lay under a bed of nails while a grown man stands on you?  I love the sport of strongman.  A lot of the events could easily translate over to your everyday life, but this dvd is not about the sport of strongman.  It's about the FEATS of strongmen.  I definitely recommend watching it for the entertainment value.  If you happen to be interested in learning how to do some of those feats, I highly recommend this book<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grip-Master-s-Manual/dp/0926888110/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grip Master's Manual</a>.  It tells you how to train for several different feats.  If you plan to actually compete at the sport strongman, get very strong, or need a good place to start/ continue in the strength world, get a book titled ""Personal Best"" by Julie Havelka.  It's my favorite book on strength training.",1259280000,,1730,4.787162162162162
