6755687,4,B00OL0020I,"You can retire your old tv recordings off of TCM or AMC (back in their better days) with this Universal Vault release. The picture is quite nice for a 70+ year old film and looks the best I've seen. All of Paris is in an uproar when Marie Roget disappears. After ten days she reappears and a few days later she disappears again. Is she the victim of foul play? The Paris police are seemingly baffled.

A good cast, a good mystery and a one hour running time add up to a pleasant film to watch.",1416096000,17,493,4.135416666666667
6755688,3,B00OL0020I,"THE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET (1942)

aka Phantom of Paris (1942)

aka El Misterio de Marie Roget

(Suspense, Black & White, 1 hr 1 min)

Universal - U.S.A.

DIRECTOR:

Phil Rosen

CAST:

Patric Knowles, Lloyd Corrigan, Nell O'Day, Maria Ouspenskaya, John Litel, Edward Norris, Maria Montez (As: Marie Roget)

COMMENTS:

Adapted from a story by Edgar Allan Poe which in turn was based on a real murder.

Montez stars as a Parisian music hall star of 1889 who plots to kill her younger sister O'Day. Norris knows about her scheme, but things go awry when Montez herself is murdered. Another woman is found with her face horribly mutilated. Knowles attempts to discover the identity of the phantom killer.

The song MAMA DIT MOI is the best scene of Maria in this movie (the singer Dorothy Triden dubs Montez in this part), in which she only appears in the first part because her character disappears in the crucial moment of the story.

A year later, 1943, Montez became a famous movie star and this movie had another premiere with the title of PHANTOM OF PARIS, as if it would be about a new film.",1414886400,12,1094,4.606217616580311

8684053,2,B00OL0020I,"This is a sub-par DVD product of a vintage film. There is no menu: the movie just starts playing on automatic repeat until you stop it. The image is very soft throughout. In places, what should be definite edges break up into horizontal lines characteristic of videotape, betraying the fact that it was not mastered from film elements. I am rating it two stars rather than one for the sake of the very enjoyable movie itself.",1532908800,,425,4.605263157894737

8684056,4,B00OL0020I,"The video and audio are top quality and the plot contains sufficient occasions to keep your interest though it has little resemblance to the actual story by E. A. Poe. The setting is Paris 1889. But the director did the sensible thing and did not have actors plodding through the film with French accents. Meanwhile, the accents of Montez and Ouspenskaya remain as usual.
The practiced gestures and grimaces of the reliable Lloyd Corrigan almost make those sharing the screen appear wooden by contrast. Watch for a one minute appearance as a zookeeper by Charles Middleton, Flash Gordons Emperor Ming.",1451520000,,601,5.02
8684057,5,B00OL0020I,I always liked Marie Montez...And it was great to see her ..Instead of somewhere on an island...She was good..,1431993600,,110,4.842105263157895
8684058,4,B00OL0020I,Neat little B film thriller from Universal that fits in nicely with their other genre films of the 1940's. Half Of the cast of The Wolf Man is here with Patric Knowles and Maria Ouspenskaya putting in some good scenes. Maria Montez as the title character has little screen time but you won't notice that in this adaption of Edgar Allen Poe's story.,1430870400,,348,4.5396825396825395
8684059,2,B00OL0020I,The movie has nothing to do with the original Poe story. It is slow moving and the video transfer is poor. You would be better of reading the original story. At least that has some entertainment value.,1428537600,,201,4.45945945945946
8684060,3,B00OL0020I,"A well-made 'B programmer.  I thought the big weakness was that too much of the deduction and crime solving happened off screen, explained by Patrick Knowles after the fact: for example, Knowles relates to Corrigan several conversations he had that were never shown.  As a result the viewer sees the mystery from Lloyd Corrigans character, and his frustration with Patrick Knowles was entirely understandable.  The viewer is never really given the clues need to solve the crime.  Corrigans character was hard to take, as so many of those stock comic relief characters were.  Maria Ouspenskya dressing him down was a nice touch,  (dont you wish you could say sit down and shut up, dope to those annoying comic relief characters?).  I still can't understand Maria Montez' popularity.",1423353600,3,781,5.102362204724409
