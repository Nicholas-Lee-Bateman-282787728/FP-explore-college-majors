8556885,3,B00ARKYT6E,"I've always liked Hugh Beaumont. As a kid who grew up with Leave It To Beaver, Hugh as Ward Cleaver was the warmhearted TV dad who always knew how to solve his sons problems. And of course he adored June, his TV wife. Later on, I found out that Hugh was a real-life minister, outside of TV. He did acting in a series of films and TV shows to support his own ministry in Los Angeles.
Anyway, one of the films he acted in was this drama, produced by the Lutheran Church. It's a sweet little story,  with its heart in the right place, but on a limited budget. The highlights in the film are the performances of Hugh, as a construction foreman, who always comes across as totally warm and sincere, and the delightful Margaret Hamilton, who plays a crotchety, gossipy secretary. Regis Toomey, as the minister in the movie, is just plain awful!
Anyway, I recommend this film, as an enjoyable piece of cinematic history.",1404172800,,913,4.467065868263473
