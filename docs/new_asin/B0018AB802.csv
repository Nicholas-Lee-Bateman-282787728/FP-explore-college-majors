3414004,5,B0018AB802,"The RKO Dick Tracy collection is remarkable.

Consisting of four films, Dick Tracy Detective, Dick Tracy Vs Cueball, Dick Tracy's Dilemna, and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome, each production is digitally restored up to exacting standards. The tones are rich and deep, the soundtrack is clean and clear of any distractions.  Even the Max Allan Collins introduction is far better than most I have seen, mind you Mr Collins has a vested interest in the detective.

To the films.  As a younger viewer, I saw them first during university when a Seattle station presented two hours of classic noir/cliffhangers 5 days a week. I lost sleep, but it was worth it.  I was hooked and part of the reason is Mr Conway and these for films.  Detective is titilating, but my favorite film is Gruesome with Boris Karloff.  It must be the villain in that film.

Special features include two sample chapters, a RKO lobby card gallery, film trailers, and of course, Mr Collins himself.

Viewed from this side of the 1940's, the comic strip/cameo introduction smacks true with many of today's comic book inspired productions.",1290556800,6,1099,4.897297297297297

3414006,5,B0018AB802,"Dick Tracy RKO Classic Collection is on a two disc DVD set and is four hours and eight minutes long. The collection has all four Dick Tracy movies released by RKO Pictures. RKO did not use any of the villains from the comic strip and instead went with their own villains. Each movie is given a brief history by former Dick Tracy writer Max Allan Collins. Below is the list of the movies in the order that they appear.

Dick Tracy, Detective is one hour and one minute long and was released in theaters on December 1, 1945. Morgan Conway is the second person to portray the famous detective. In this movie the killer goes by the name of Splitface; who is not an original Dick Tracy comic strip character. Splitface is killing the jurors who sent him prison. It is up to Dick Tracy to find and to rescue Junior and Tess Trueheart from Splitface. In this B movie, Pat Patton is portrayed as a smart and not a helpless sidekick to Dick Tracy. The movie version stays true to the comic strip.

Dick Tracy vs. Cueball is one hour and two minutes and was released in theaters on December 18, 1946. This is the second of four Dick Tracy movies release through RKO studios. Harry ""Cueball"" Lake has just been released from prison and is being paid to steal uncut diamonds. Cueball kills Lester Abbott the guy who has the diamonds. A quick note; Trevor Bardette who played Professor Starling in the first Dick Tracy makes a cameo appearance as the doomed Lester Abbott. Cueball goes into hiding until he gets his money for the diamonds. Cueball kills Percival Priceless because he believes that he brought the cops in on this and Cueball also kills Filthy Flora for trying to steal his diamonds. Cueball eventually meets his death on the railroad tracks. In this movie Pat Patton is dumbed down and Junior is portray by another child actor and is less involved with the case. Also Vitamin Flintheat is introduced to us in this movie and he provided comic relief in this movie. Another character in this movie that is not from the comic book is Jules Sparkle who is a jeweler and sells diamonds for a living. This would be Morgan Conway's second and last time to portray Dick Tracy. Dick Tracy vs. Cueball is a half a step down from Dick Tracy, Detective but still worth watching.

Dick Tracy's Dilemma is one hour and was released in theaters on May 20, 1947. Ralph Byrd returns as Dick Tracy in this third installment of the Dick Tracy's movies. Ralph Byrd played Dick Tracy in the four original Republic Pictures serials. Junior does not make an appearance in the last two films and this would be Vitamin Flintheart last appearance. Tony Barrett who plays Sam, a henchman, also plays Melody Fiske in Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. The villain this time is The Claw who right hand is missing and has a hook there instead. Him and two other thieves rob a fur store and kill the night watchman. It is up to Dick Tracy to recover the furs and bring the men into justice. The story has a minor subplot. Mr. Humphries, the owner of the furs, hired The Claw and the gang to rob the furs so he could collect the insurance money on them. The Claw meet his death when he raised his hook to kill Tracy; the hook get caught in some live wires and The Claw is electrocuted. This is by some critics the grittiest of all four Dick Tracy movies. Dick Tracy's Dilemma gets an AA++.

Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome is one hour and five minutes and was released in theaters on September 26, 1947 and of the four Dick Tracy's movies, this is the longest one of them all. Also, this movie has some fun with some of the characters names like: Dr. A. Tomic, Professor I. M. Learned, and X-Ray. When Pat Patton is in a taxidermy store, there is a sign on the wall that says Y Stuffem. Also Junior and Vitamin Flinthart are not in this one. The Pat Patton character provides some comic relief, but is not dim witted as in the last two films. Basically the plot reviles around Gruesome, who just escaped from prison and is hooked up with his old crime buddy Melody, a piano player. To make a long story short Gruesome steals with the aide of a scientist formula to freeze people for a short amount of time while they rob a bank. Dick Tracy finds out and tries to save the day. The in the final battle between Dick Tracy and Gruesome is play out like one of the cliff hanger chapters in the Dick Tracy Republic Pictures serials. This movie marks the fourth and final installment of the Dick Tracy movies. Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome gets an AAA+++.

Dick Tracy RKO Classic Collection gets an AAAAA+++++.

The first film hits all the right notes, great noir vibe,  and the best translations of Dick Tracy comic strip characters for that time. RKO Pictures did a great job, as they did with most of the pictures they made in those days. The other films are not to bad either, lots of fun in the final flick with Boris Karloff as the character Gruesome. Each movie has a little intro by Max Allan Collins (who wrote the strip from late 70s to the early 90s), which is a swank little bonus provided by VCI.

The story line and plot, Concerning Gruesome (Boris Karloff) using a gas that puts people into temporary suspended animation to rob a bank, moves at a gallop and is delivered with humor and style --- There's not a dull moment in the film and it's more than worth the vintage B-movie enthusiast's time --- Boris Karloff was a fine actor, we are hard-pressed to offer examples - unless we mean his memorable gallery of monsters, mummies, mad scientists and assorted grotesques --- In this unlikely film can be found one of the best performances of his career: that of a criminal, to be sure, but an ominous character who projects menace rather than horror --- Karloff underplays the ruthless, single-minded social misfit whose manner is close enough to the norm to enable him to move among commonplace types without attracting undue attention, but is at the same time sufficiently glowering to intimidate even his henchmen --- Favorite scene is when Karloff is putting his victims in a huge furnace for safekeeping --- Boris Karloff earns top billing over leading man Ralph Byrd in RKO's final Dick Tracy caper --- Saw Skelton Knaggs listed in the credits--he is a hoot to watch as X-Ray!! Something about this late actor is funny to watch, I don't know if it is his voice or his looks or what, but he is something else in this film.

However, the Dick Tracy movies are ones to hold back for the little ones.  They *are* film noir, the fight scenes serious, murders are abundant.  This is some gritty realism here, along with great lighting and night scenes.

For adults, great viewing.  I loved Boris Karloff as Gruesome in the final film.  As for the two actors in the role of Dick Tracy, I liked Conway Morgan's style and treatment of the character, but RKO went with Ralph Byrd for the last two films, perhaps because he had done the role for the earlier DT serials and was well-liked by audiences.  I really liked the child actor who was DT's son in the first film, not too impressed with the talent for that role beyond that.

Dick Tracy the movie was a good attempt to make a noir story with Dick the hero. Solid B movie all the way. Next was DT vs Cueball story lacked some punch but the criminal was a good creation and would have fit in with the original comic strip.
Next up was Ralph Byrd who protrayed Tracy in 4 serials earlier in his career. He not only acts the part but also looks it with his wide strong jaw and solid build he was definitely more than any other actor to look the role and was the closest to acting the most like Tracey.  His movies were Dick Tracy's Dilemma and DT meets Gruesome which  stars Boris Karloff as Gruesome. The movies were more B than the first two but still worth a look and definite good time fillers.
Karloff always lifts a movie up from the mundane to make it a good viewing enjoyable time. The four movies are fun and at a reasonable price. The films are presented here by VCI and are a solid fun set that look fine and have good sound. I do not have a complaint of any film I have purchased from VCI they do a really fine job at presenting the forgotten films of long ago.",1363219200,3,1245,4.056910569105691

The Dick Tracy comic strip began around 1930 when Chester Gould created it for the Chicago Tribune. Some said Dick Tracy was based on Eliot Ness, the famous Prohibition Agent of the US Treasury Department. Its sought to influence public opinion to support the police in Chicago and elsewhere. Adults liked it because of its clever stories that appealed to them. Its villains were famous for their distinctive features, a belief fostered by some criminologists that is now out of date. It was continued after the retirement of Chester Gould but was later dropped. Comic strips have a limited lifetime.

The RKO film factory ground out low budget movies. Morgan Conway and Ralph Byrd played Dick Tracy in these movies. Its popularity showed it met the needs and wants of its audiences (fighting crime in the city). The comic strip would also have interesting facts and tips for the general public. Crime dramas continue as a staple for movies and television today. For more details view the individual reviews for each movie.

Dick Tracy, Detective (1946) deals with the slashing murders of people. What is the connection? After the Mayor gets a death threat Dick Tracy figures out the solution and searches for the killer Splitface.

Dick Tracy versus Cueball (1946) starts by investigating a murder on a ship. This leads to a stolen jewelry gang. [A small business operation.] Dick Tracy uses a lure to locate the murderer, who makes his final escape in a railroad yard.

Dick Tracys Dilemma (1947) begins with a robbery-murder at a fur vault. They track the connection to The Claw. Dick Tracy pursues The Claw who meets his end while hiding by a high-voltage transformer.

Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome (1947) deals with a bank robbery where a toxic gas immobilizes the customers. Dick traces the gas to a scientific lab, and connects a worker there to Gruesome. Dick catches up to the villain, shots are fired, and Gruesome falls.",1481673600,,1963,4.9154078549848945
