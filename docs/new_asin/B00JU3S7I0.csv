6390116,5,B00JU3S7I0,"Hiromi is one of the artists that you want to watch play her music. She is so expressive and she becomes one her music a true delight to listen to and to watch. I can't say what my favorite song is only because each performance I hypnotized or mesmerized by the audio or the video. Watching her play with Simon and Davis and how they meld into one at times is just incredible. If you are a fan of Hiromi, you have to have this DVD, plain and simple!.",1436140800,,450,4.067415730337078

of her cd's, I urge anyone to try one of her dvd's I suggest MOVE it's the best just beats live at  BLUE NOTE  NEW YORK",1413417600,,257,3.7037037037037037
6390118,5,B00JU3S7I0,"Killer keyboardist and she was smart to hire the guns she did as a rhythm section. No bad songs or moments. My only wish was to have English subtitles for what she said. The other odd thing was no mention of which hall it was in, just Tokyo. Super, a must see for anyone into fusion. There are a lot of melodic spots which are very nice mixed in with typical fusion speed and virtuosity.",1413158400,,387,4.173333333333333

6390120,5,B00JU3S7I0,"I was unaware that this was a Region 2 DVD when purchasing and in fact didn't even know that until I was looking at the product page prior to writing this review just now.  I am in the U.S. and it plays fine on my Blu-Ray/DVD player. I guess I should stop there because already the Region Control Police are probably going to come to my house to confiscate my player for having the audacity to play a region it wasn't intended for. *

Performance-wise, this is another superb performance by Hiromi, Anthony and Simon.  They are such gifted musicians and I sit there wondering just how the heck do they manage to learn the music and play it so precisely and dynamically.  Audio quality for the 5.1 mix is excellent, with instruments sounding natural and the mix being balanced.  I haven't listened to the 2.0 track.  Video is fine, with the camera capturing nice close-ups of Hiromi's astonishing keyboard abilities, along with nicely framed focusing on Anthony and Simon.  There isn't the dizzying back and forth switching from performer to performer that ruins so many other concert videos.

All in all this is a wow performance - great music by hugely talented artists, captured with very good video and audio.

* (By the way - the Amazon product page says this is a Region 2 disc, but I checked and my copy says it is ALL regions)",1407801600,3,1333,4.567226890756302
6390121,5,B00JU3S7I0,"Once again, Hiromi, Simon and Anthony give us another stunning performance, this one perhaps the best captured on video. The sound, camera angles, and the overall mood of the band and audience is captured beautifully in a large hall, this time. From the first aggressive jab of her elbow on the keys, you know Hiromi is eager to play, as always! And, of course, it gets just better and better, from song to song! And you know- when Hiromi sports that cool 'rooster' hairdo, (that she abandoned for awhile, and which which I love, by the way) you know she means business!

There's a lot of soulful, bluesy playing, dynamics and Hiromi's blinding speed, as well as moments of what might be considered 'prog' rock, but without the usual guitar found in most prog/fusion. Bits of cool, funky stuff interweave here and there, and at one point Hiromi even does a cute little bit of funky dancing as she approaches the piano at the intro of one song! Simon Philips does great drums solos here and there, as does Anthony Jackson, occasionally on the bass.

Some songs may have been fairly new at the time, since Simon and Hiromi give each other very gleeful looks, once they've managed to perfectly end some of the more intense and complex pieces. While watching, I couldn't help but ponder as to whether or not Hiromi's hands and fingers twitch uncontrollably while she sleeps with all that incredible activity she exhibits when she zones into what I like to call 'Hiromi World', just killing it, and loving the keyboard and music above and beyond anything else that exists in the Universe! Her timing, phrasing, feel and touch are all impeccable- I could imagine her as a very good drummer, in fact!

Having seen her in Toronto only a couple of weeks ago (playing this album, as well as probably all of 'Alive', her most recent), I was actually more impressed with the sound on this DVD overall! Though they sounded great (we were in the second row), Simon's drums had a bit of a 'ring' to them, and Anthony's bass was a bit muddy in tone. Even Hiromi's piano could have used a bit more treble and volume, but perhaps it was simply the acoustics of the hall (which she had not played in before) and/or the sound man, sound system or whatever. But here on this DVD, we hear the brilliant sound that was somewhat lacking in Toronto, back in late June.
I hope this great trio continues on!",1405123200,6,2380,4.582159624413146
6390122,5,B00JU3S7I0,"This trio's play is always amazing and the music is so nice.

Performance is the best.
Picture quality is very good with very high rate (almost between 8.0 Mbps and 9.0 Mbps) even if this is not blu-ray disc but DVD. The screen size is 16:9 wide.
Sound quality is O.K. 48kHz 16 bit LPCM and 48kHz 448kbps Dolby Digital 5.1.
Hopefully, blu-ray disc and blu-ray audio disc should be released.

I would like to recommend this DVD, CD and SACD to all music listeners. You will find new music world with so high level performance.",1403913600,2,525,4.458333333333333
