8397739,4,B003IWE0OY,"Andy is hilarious. I love his law of attraction material. It isn't always entirely original. Some of it is obviously borrowed from Ester Hicks.

What makes Andy unique is his performance and that is exactly what is in this dvd. Stand up comedy with music/dancing to a metaphysic beat. It could have been filmed soooo much better so I can't give it 5 stars. The message is worth 4. Give it a shot if you are a seeker.",1419465600,,416,4.333333333333333
