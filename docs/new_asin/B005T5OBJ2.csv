4888021,5,B005T5OBJ2,"Two best friends re-live their incredible 25,000 mile journey following
Marco Polo's fabled routes through the east.

They had no crew, no support team, just two guys from Queens, New York
City with a bunch of cameras and video equipment in their backpacks
slogging alone through unbelievably difficult territory, risking their
lives by crossing into hostile countries without visas, or entering
strictly forbidden areas. Sometimes they would get stuck in a location
for weeks before being able to find a way to go on.

But these are two tough, as well as endearing dudes. They seemed to
manage to make friends wherever they went, but also to stare down
Chinese army officers with nothing but a bluff.

It's interesting and effective to see these guys, now ten years older,
reliving the journey in an interview setting, inter-cut with their
video footage and still photographs of the journey. You get both the
immediacy of the events, and the benefit of hindsight and memory.

Even though the film is only 90 minutes, it somehow doesn't feel
rushed, although I could have happily watched hours more. In fact, my
only complaint is that I wish it was longer so we could have seen even
more details. Quite unique, and a lot of educational fun.",1331856000,21,1240,4.862559241706161
4888022,3,B005T5OBJ2,"A little disappointed.  I was expecting a little more on the natural scenery and burden of beast for the travel.  It dealt with a lot of political issues trying to follow the travel routes of Marco Polo.  I want to feel how it was, not what the political issues we are facing now in following the footsteps.",1330214400,,307,4.350877192982456

4888064,5,B005T5OBJ2,Watched this video in a high school geography class.  The students sat on the edge on their seats the whole time and engaged in lively discussions afterwards.  Many thanks to Fran and Denis for sharing these amazing travels!,1386288000,,224,4.868421052631579

4888070,5,B005T5OBJ2,"These two guys recreate the route without using air travel for any segment.  They have to work through visa problems, heat, cold, etc.  They show us parts of the world that I'll never visit (because the regions are too remote, too uncomfortable, too lawless, too inconsequential nowadays).  They do get tired of being stared-at in China - though most other places they get along marvelously with the locals.  Their adventure travelogue (and fortitude) captivated my wife (who is not usually interested in this kind of thing) and myself.",1364083200,6,536,5.056818181818182

It is GREAT to see Denis and Francis and hear them talking about their experiences as well as seeing the actual places they visited.  Having traveled to many parts of our world, this added to our knowledge, particularily these places that are not open usually to westerners.",1362960000,6,423,4.25

4888073,4,B005T5OBJ2,"My kids are learning about Marco Polo and I was looking for ""supplementary"" educational materials, and stumbled on this film.

#1. This movie is about a massive, crazy global travel adventure. It's not really about Marco Polo. However, my kids now have a much better appreciation of the actual route Polo traveled, the distance involved, the hardships, climates, and peoples on the way.
#2. This movie shows a lot about the peoples and on-the-ground life & politics of some very remote places in the Middle East and Central Asia. Watch this and get an appreciation for what it's like in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Iran, etc. though note that this journey occured in the early 1990s, long before 9/11, before the Taliban took over, and before the US invasion of Afghanistan.
#3. This movie is about two young men bitten by a travel bug the size of Manhattan. Many of us enjoy travel, even travel to exotic places with some hardship involved. These guys are off-scale in their fascination with the hardest travel to the hardest places. Makes me think of that book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Young-Pelton-s-The-World-s-Most-Dangerous-Places-5th-Edition/dp/0060011602/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Young Pelton's The World's Most Dangerous Places: 5th Edition</a>.
#4. These guys must have accumulated tons of footage from their 2 year journey. Only 90 minutes made it into this film.  I expected to be more impressed with the imagery and storytelling/editing. It's done competently and was enough to keep me engaged for 90 minutes but it wasn't stupendous.

Overall recommend, and I was satisfied with my purpose of enriching kids' understanding of Polo's journey and also modern geography.",1357171200,10,1744,5.623574144486692
4888074,5,B005T5OBJ2,These two men are amazing.  They began the journey as seemingly lost men with nothing to loose and returned as wise men with everything to gain.  I'm proud of them and wish them continued success.,1348012800,,196,4.571428571428571
4888075,5,B005T5OBJ2,"I saw part of this on PBS. I had to see it all. these two guys are now hero's of mine. I have watched this over and over. I'd love to see the tackle ""in the footsteps of Sir Richard Burton"" and follow his pilgrimage to Mecca.",1345507200,,225,3.8085106382978724
4888076,5,B005T5OBJ2,"It's one of the best documentaries I've seen on PBS. I watch it every time it's on, even though I already own it. It really gives you a feel for how certain things have remained the same from Marco Polo's time to the present; the hospitality of the people, their customs, the food they eat.
It's not a history of Marco Polo so much as two guys following Polo's path, and documenting the similarities and differences in their journey, and the adversity they came across every step of the way.",1342569600,,491,4.466666666666667
4888077,5,B005T5OBJ2,"In a nutshell, I LOVED THIS MOVIE!

I'm a videographer & photographer who loves to travel.  So much about this movie spoke to me.  It's better than any reality TV show or horribly written script.  Dennis & Francis are heroes in my eyes.  So many beautiful images & life lessons.  But, not in a preachy, annoying way.  In an inspiring way.

I was in tears at the end when they arrived in Venice.  I didn't want it to end!  I hope the guys travel again and make another movie.  Their strength, determination, appreciation for beauty, talent and most of all their honesty & openness will always stay with me.  THAT is the mark of a great movie in my opinion!",1338854400,7,655,4.366666666666666
4888078,5,B005T5OBJ2,"WOW! This film was super amazing. I am from New York City as these boys are and I think it was there NY ways that kept them alive & full of helpful strangers to help them on their journey. Just strictly from the standpoint that this trip trip they took was prior- 9/11 and could never be done by two Americans today (even if they balls to do it)  made this film blow my mind! It was about two regular guys from America meeting people & seeing things that 99.9% of Americans will never ever get to see. Places that probably aren't even on a map. The guys suffered the heat, cold, hunger, exhaustion, fear, etc... BUT also soaked in the beauty, culture, people & landscapes and they captured it all on film. I have this on film & book and anyone who thinks this is a 3 star film or below must be blind....I have never seen anything as great as this.

This is a must see for everyone. Highly suggest this for parents to watch with there kids & discus foreign culture.",1336435200,9,964,4.233695652173913
4888079,5,B005T5OBJ2,"In The Footsteps of Marco Polo is a 5 star adventure of the kind you dream of when you sleep or even daydream.
Please be careful because you will want to  devise an an adventure of your own,because this film is so real, so interesting you will get that WANDERLUST, no doubt about that................

ps: the book is good too.",1336435200,,327,4.433333333333334
4888080,5,B005T5OBJ2,"Why look to Hollywood or History books when real life heroes can be found right in New York City!  Who could ask for better mentors for our youth than Belliveau and O Donnell?
Watch their awesome travel adventure and your heart rate will go up when you imagine the stresses and immense dangers they encountered. This is a must see for anyone who wants to experience sensitivity to world issues, grass roots brotherhood and natural beauty brought to us by two brave artists.",1334016000,,473,4.698795180722891
4888081,5,B005T5OBJ2,"I will preface this by saying at 55 I can think of very few events of whatever stripe I have initially witnessed on television that were of this potency, this would make the short list of about 10 of the most momentous things I have ever seen on television. As this is a documentary of sorts I would say challenged only by Burns' Civil War documentary on that list of 10.
While the adventure itself requires very heavy plaudits, (I mean to the extent possible these guys have traced Polo's route and covered it in the manner Polo had in the 14th century)it is the character of these 2 individuals, that I really must refer to as ""freaking guys"", 2 real good old buddies from around NYC, and each with alot of the characteristics I believe the rest of America, and maybe the world, find appealing about New Yorkers.
The predicaments they find themselves in at many turns in these modern times has much to do with what make this so compelling a tale. And for all of the tension involved in much of the area through which they traverse, a marvelous human story ends up being told, with quite some good degree of pageantry and great beauty at many turns. And to me the always heartening real time proof that there are common threads between people of this world of nearly immeasurably different backgrounds. I think that can finally be distilled down to Mother's everywhere love their children, likely not what anyone else will take out of it, but a very rewarding human tale involving 2 guys who I believe all Americans can be so proud of, to say yeah, those 2 are ours.",1333843200,2,1567,4.5017543859649125
4888082,5,B005T5OBJ2,Timeless. Now in my own footsteps & traveling due to this book. Learned a lot about Den/Frans adventures. I couldn't put the book down.,1333843200,,135,4.666666666666667
8485790,4,B005T5OBJ2,My church group is planning a large party with a Marco Polo/Silk Road theme so I picked up this video.  It is follows the gutsy adventures of two men trying to retrace Marco Polo on the Silk Road - very interesting and loaded with exciting cultural information and a great ending.,1526601600,,280,4.490196078431373
8485791,2,B005T5OBJ2,"I do not recommend this DVD.  More than half of it is devoted to a shallow retrospective by the two travelers and what they choose to talk about often had little to do with the countries they visited or the various cultures and customs (like, most wouldn't care a whit about one of the men's Indonesian tattoo experience).  More, it looked like many of the video clips were grabs from other photographers.  Given this, it's pretty hard to believe that they did all that they claimed to do, like ride Bactrian camels through the desert.  The treatment was so superficial that no more than 3-4 minutes were spent on China when Polo spent years living there.  Please don't waste your money!  This DVD was a real disappointment.  Surely there are better ones out there.",1526342400,,765,4.664179104477612
8485792,5,B005T5OBJ2,"This is by far the best video about the travels of Marco Polo and the Silk Road.  Unlike the other videos, this is a real adventure story where they interact with ""real"" people and in the process show us how customs officials work in other countries, especially Afghanistan and Iran.  Most importantly, however,  is that they show us how kind and generous all the people in those far away lands are; and, how difficult their lives are. This video definitely is a 5-star one.",1523404800,,474,4.619047619047619
8485793,4,B005T5OBJ2,"Interesting, but it is mostly about the ""two guys"" rather than Marco Polo (although they keep mentioning his name).",1502064000,,115,5.105263157894737
8485794,5,B005T5OBJ2,"I really enjoyed this - it would be a great companion if you're studying Marco Polo, but I don't know if children would find it as fascinating as I did. Their bravery and persistence is a good lesson as they tracked the steps of Marco Polo. I recommend !",1482019200,,254,4.204081632653061

8485799,5,B005T5OBJ2,"Really enjoyed this after studying a bit of Marco Polo's history. Most amazingly, some legs of the journey revealed that things had not changed that much since Marco Polo's time. It's interesting to have a window into how varied peoples, customs, and lifestyles are in this present day. I admire the authors who took this ""incredible journey.""",1446163200,,343,5.035087719298246
