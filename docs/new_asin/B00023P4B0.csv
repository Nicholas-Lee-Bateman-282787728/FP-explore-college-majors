2059927,5,B00023P4B0,"I just got this DVD 2 days ago and have already listenend to it twice. In one word it is ""awesome"". I have a high end audio system and I was very pleased with the sound on the 5.1 surround sound. The picture quality is also very good and cmaera angles are great. This is what a concert DVD should sound and look like.  Sound Stage has done a good job of mixing. I would put it up there with my best DVDs. At some points the voices are a little low but I can live with that.  Stevie's voice is great after all these years.  Lindsey, John and Mick are equally good.  Great band, Great songs, Great DVD. A must for FM fans.",1087516800,,620,3.975806451612903
2059928,5,B00023P4B0,"Buckingham's hair has a grayish sheen; Nicks, who I have seen several times as a solo act, is clearly a mature woman long past the days of her svelte Welsh Witch; John McVie and Mick Fleetwood lead both of them in age.  Given this, one almost expects a ""nostalgia"" tour, but nostalgia be damned: even in the absence of Christine McVie, this is still one helluva band, and God help recent girl singers and boy bands who might be tempted to sneer: when Fleetwood Mac takes the stage, you get Big Time Take No Prisoners Rock And Roll.

I was fortunate enough to see Fleetwood Mac on this particular tour when the band played Biloxi, Mississippi--and I was even more fortunate to be sitting within arm's reach of the stage, directly in front of the wall of energy the band generates.  While nothing can really duplicate the experience of a truly powerhouse live concert, LIVE IN BOSTON comes very close to capturing the authority of what I experienced that evening, and that says a great deal for both the band and this concert film.

Christine McVie's absence, the loss of her cool blue voice that so perfectly balances out Buckingham and Nicks extremes, the loss of her uniquely beautiful songs--that's regrettable, but I must say the band doesn't let it slow them down any.  From such Mac standards as ""Go Your Own Way"" from the classic RUMORS to picks from the recent SAY YOU WILL, everything crackles with energy.

Nicks' voice, always a delicate instrument, has darkened with time and is no longer as ethereal as once it was, but her richness of tone more than makes up for the loss; songs like ""Landslide"" and ""Beautiful Child"" sound better than ever.  Buckingham's poetry-in-motion guitar playing and electrically eccentric vocals combine with a manic physical energy to create a huge musical and physical presence.  And while the unassuming John McVie fades into the background to work his wonders on bass, Mick Fleetwood is positively demonic in the star drum trap--and the two roll it out like thunder.  It's just a knockout all the way.

The previous DVD of THE DANCE tour is perhaps more technically perfect--but while excellent, that performance was more formal in tone; LIVE IN BOSTON is simply raw rock and roll, ready to blow the roof off.  True, the accompanying CD is weak--but CD or not CD, if you'll pardon the bad pun, is no major question.  This is a concert DVD that will simply blow you away.  Worth every cent!

2059929,3,B00023P4B0,"I bought the DVD the day it came out even though I have the Dance.  Were it not for the 15 or so different songs on this DVD compared to The Dance I probably would have taken a pass. Plus I really loved Say You Will which I think is the best record to come out over the last five years.
After watching Disc 1, I felt there was something missing.  Even with the backup musicians something was still not right. Without Christine McVie the concert seemed flat.  Plus the vocals are a bit low in the mix.  Songs like Big Love were peformed almost identically to the more superior sounding versions from The Dance which created a strong sense of deja vue.  Still, there were many bright spots particularly Beautiful Child, Say You Will and Landslide.  After watching the entire DVD, I would have to say that it is pretty good...but the Dance was better.

Recommended? Yes, with reservations.",1087430400,,886,4.5
2059930,5,B00023P4B0,"The Mac is Back!! Almost 7 years after the reunion tour (The Dance) Fleetwood Mac comes back and shows us why they are concidered on of the best bands around. This is their complete show from Boston and you will be Blown away. Highlights include Come and Im So Afraid- Lindsey just rocks out on his guitar. Along with songs form their incredible new album Say You Will , the Mac also lays down classic hit after classic hit and incredible perfomances  for 2 and 1/2 hours. The CD and DvD are top shelf and recorded in Dolby Digital and its one of the better Music DVDS put out. DO not listen to the nay sayers about going thru the motions or other so called flaws they list or being a waste of money for it is simply not true- they do not know what they are talking about and can be classified as true head cases. The Chemisrty on stage is great and there are lots of touching moments and funny ones as well. A truely great all around Rock Show from the Mac. Pick up the DVD-you won't be dissappointed. It just doesnt get any better than this.",1087430400,3,1043,4.215
2059931,5,B00023P4B0,"the only concert dvd i know of shot in widescreen making the video stunning.  & of course it's fleetwood mac which means incredible singing & playing.  yes, we do miss christine mcvie, but i guess we have to take what we can get.  but the widescreen image alone is worth the price of admission.",1087430400,3,294,4.407407407407407
2059932,4,B00023P4B0,"I saw Fleetwood Mac on the ""Say You Will"" tour in Oklahoma City and Toronto and was amazed how the different the two shows were. The OKC show suffered from horrible acoustics and technical glitches - neither was the band's fault but the Toronto show was first-class. Happily, the Boston show on this DVD is seamless and glitch-free. There are several surprises: Stevie Nicks' ""Beautiful Child"" is wonderfully emotional and beautifully sung, ""Rhiannon"" and ""Gypsy"" both fare better than on ""The Dance""  but ""Silver Springs"" isn't performed as well - perhaps because it is familiar now and it wasn't back in 1997. Lindsey Buckingham's fiery guitar and quirky vocals are one of a kind and he is in fine form here. But Christine McVie's presence is sorely missed: her upbeat, bouncy love songs always countered the darker material from Nicks and Buckingham and her backing vocals helped propel the performances from all the voalists. The accompanying CD is a nice bonus",1087430400,2,965,4.9937888198757765
2059933,5,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac is still a force to be reckoned with.  I was also at this show back in September and was honored to be a part of Fleetwood Mac's long and storied history.  This is by far their best live concert captured on tape.........beautifully done, credit should be give to the producers who captured many nuances between the members.  There is no slowing down Lindsey, and he is amazing on acoustic guitar especially ""Never Going Back Again"" which is re-tooled to perfection!  Stevie is beautiful as expected, but also lets her inner beauty shine thru, most notably on ""Landslide"", ""Beautiful Child"" and ""Goodbye Baby"". Mike Fleetwood's energy is astonishing and is the steadfast and driving beat thru-out this amazing night.  John McVie shouldn't be overlooked either, an important backbone to the band.  All the members filled the gap Christine McVie has left with so much spirit and life.  You MUST see this DVD, not just for die-hard fans, but anyone who appreciates this band that continues to give so much!!",1087344000,5,1017,4.947058823529412
2059934,4,B00023P4B0,"First of all, I wrote a review of THE DANCE that seemed to never get posted.  It wasn't very complimentary.  That show was very lack-lustre to me; it was too polished, too rehearsed, and severely lacked energy.  It seemed more like a recital than a concert.  But that's mostly because it was a one-off, ""staged"" show to record a live ""reunion"" album.
This new DVD is far, far superior to THE DANCE.  The energy level is so much higher, and the performance is much more ""real.""  Part of that is simply song selection, which is much better for this tour.  But also, it was filmed in front of a real audience as part of a real tour.  And it shows.
The hands-down highlight of this DVD is ""Come.""  First of all, this song is one of the best tracks from SAY YOU WILL, and one of Lindsey's best tracks ever.  But the performance of it here is absolutely incindiary.  This reconfirms my notion that he is one of the absolute geniuses of modern rock music.  BUY THIS DVD JUST FOR THIS ONE SONG.  I'm not kidding!
But then, every song here from SAY YOU WILL comes across even better than the original versions.  The music on that album was made to be performed live, and its a shame that they don't do more of it.
Other highlights include a great new version of ""Eyes of the World""; a ""Rhiannon"" that is still pale compared to Stevie's excorcism rituals of the 70s (as Mick once called it), but much better than what was on THE DANCE; a really killer new rendition of ""Never Goin' Back Again""; a mesmerizing performance of ""Beautiful Child"" (this is the first tour this song's ever been included in); a blazing ""Stand Back""; and for me at least (I know I'm in the minority here!), Mick's solo during ""World Turning.""
This is an almost perfect Mac concert.  I honestly can't think what I would have changed about this, other than to include 1 or 2 more tunes from SAY YOU WILL.
So why did I only give it 4 stars??  Because of the accompanying CD.  On the one hand, I'm thrilled that they included a CD with the DVD.  Brilliant move.  But if they were going to do that, why in the hell did they just include repeats of the songs that were on THE DANCE CD????  That makes absolutely no sense.  Out of the 10 songs, only 3 of them (""Come,"" ""Eyes"", and ""Stand Back"") are ""new"".  We still don't have an ""official"" live version of ""Gypsy"" or ""Gold Dust Woman"", and those two sounded quite fine here and should have been included on the CD.  As should ""Beautiful Child"".  We certainly don't need yet another live album with ""Rhiannon"", ""Dreams"", ""Landslide"" and ""Silver Springs"", especially as these versions are in almost exactly the same arrangements as what were played for THE DANCE.  Assinine.  And why only one SYW song?  Luckily, it was ""Come"".  But ""Peacekeeper"" at least should also have been included.
So if I were rating only the DVD, this would get 5 stars easily, and I would wish that I could rate it higher.  But a star gets taken off for making the effort to include a CD, but making it almost pointless.
A lot of people ranked THE DANCE very highly, which I don't agree with.  If you liked that, you will love LIVE IN BOSTON.  And wait 'til you see ""Landslide""...it will make you cry.  No lie.",1087257600,6,3193,4.395904436860068

Stevie and Lindsey are at there best and Lindsey is such an awesome Guitarist and singer and song writer They Rocked The Fleet Center in Boston and This will be a definetly a must own dvd of a legendary band at there best.

2060011,4,B00023P4B0,"The Who - Live in Boston captures The Who in a difficult period, and a period of transformation. The death of John Entwistle the night before the tour  gave Pete more room to experiment, but also could give the music an emptiness, especially given that Pino Palladino, (Entwistle's successor) plays at a low volume, and uses a very smooth, jazzy sound. On this Dvd, Pete takes full advantage of his room for exploration, and goes particularly wild during Sparks and See Me, Feel Me. Roger Daltrey said he had trouble hearing himself at this show, so he over-sang. This is noticeable at some points in the Dvd, when he sounds uncharacteristically strained. Some of this could also be because this was the second-to-last night of the tour. He does better after the first few songs, although he cracks during the Wgfa scream, and ends it quickly. Pino plays well at this show, and mimics John's bass lines very well, even though he is often hard to hear. Zach Starkey is on fire at this show, even though his playing isn't really much like Keith Moon's. Simon Townshend plays some very good guitar at this show, as well as backing vocals, although he takes a back seat to Pete.
The setlist contains all of the hits, plus the extremely rarely played Another Tricky Day and Sea and Sand, the former not having been played since 1981. The performance is very energetic, with My Generation sounding very similar to some of the Moon-era versions.
The bonus interviews with Roger and Pete are nice, and cover a lot of material that is isn't often covered in depth.
Overall a very good, underrated, Dvd. Highly Recommended",1459036800,,1612,4.716312056737588

2060112,3,B00023P4B0,"The concert is wonderful. The band is great.

Okay, now that I got that out of the way;
The CD only has a fraction of the tracks. They could have made this a nice LIVE CD but didn't for some reason.
The DVD, the complete show, was shot in WIDE SCREEN but was encoded for Standard screen format.
In order to view the video on your wide screen television you have to ZOOM into the standard formatted screen. Because of this, the picture quality is poor.
I can't imagine what they were thinking when they made the decision to encode it this way.
Why bring a camera crew to a concert, shoot a wonderful performance and then release it in a compressed format?

But, despite all that, the concert is fantastic.  It would be fantastic on an old Black and White television pulled from the air using rabbit ears.

I hope they re-release it in better quality in the future.",1390694400,,863,4.375

2060142,3,B00023P4B0,"I would most likely consider Fleetwood Mac my favorite rock group and Stevie Nicks favorite female singer.  My music video/concert collection has long included this title as I have most of their releases including the original Mirage 1982 and Stevie Nicks 1983 concerts on LaserDisc.  I attended this performance when their tour was in my local area (not in Boston) and remember the concert with great fondness.  The Fleetwood Mac Live in Boston DVD has been enjoyed on my system countless times since it's release.

With a package that includes the entire concert across 2 DVD's along with a bonus CD of 10 songs recorded during their performance, why a 3 star rating for a title I must truly like?  It all has to do with the potential of what's possible now compared to when this DVD was originally released.  First is the need to zoom the non-anamorphic 16x9 coding so that it properly fills out the display area on modern widescreens each time I watch which results in a further loss of picture resolution.  The 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack generally provides good crowd surrounds to help simulate the feeling of actually being in the audience though the dynamic range is more limited than it could have been.

How do I know?  Most of the time packaged media (i.e. DVD, Blu-ray) is far superior to what is possible via downloads (Netflix; Amazon; iTunes, etc.) or from cable/satellite providers due to the wider signal bandwidths available and utilized.  Recently I was scanning through my cable (Comcast) channels and found this concert being broadcast by Palladia in HD.  Immediately hit the record button on my HD DVR cable box.

Afterwards, I performed an A-B comparison between the version that was recorded from cable and my DVD copies. No question the image even at 1080i/60 has the clarity the DVD simply cannot match.  Much of the concert was recorded under very dark stage environments with many of the FM members also wearing predominately Black.  Instead of being crushed as they are on the DVD, the cable image has much better detailing in the dark portions of the screen.  While the broadcast audio (source ""Direct"" through my receiver) was also 5.1 Dolby Digital, it was easy to hear the much improved bass response resulting in added fullness to the entire sound field.  High frequencies also benefited from not being nearly as compressed with the new found clarity adding much sparkle and life to these same performances I know well.

Since it appears the HD masters already exist, Soundstage/Warner Reprise/WTTW Chicago/HD Ready or whomever has the rights to this program, I'm ready to upgrade to the Blu-ray version of this title.  About the only new coding needed would be 5.1 (or better yet 7.1) DTS HD/Dolby HD Lossless audio tracks and the package would be complete.",1309219200,3,2793,4.89384288747346
2060143,4,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac at their energetic best, this live album is a joy to watch, classics such as Rhiannon, Silver Springs and Go Your Own Way are played with great energy and new songs such as Come and Say You Will are also stand outs. Overall the only thing this live album missed is the presence of Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks just cant cut the mustard on Dont Stop and its missing such classics as Little Lies, Everywhere, Say You Love Me and You Make Loving Fun.",1306713600,,462,4.383720930232558
2060144,2,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac, unless you are a true fan, really puts on a senseless, energy-drained show here that you'll sicken of faster than a can of Gummie Worms at the State Fair. And State Fairs, indeed, are where this group ought to be playing; right next to Whitesnake and Rick Springfield and the demolition derby and blue ribbon goats.

Buckingham gets his ya-yas out a couple times on lead guitar, but other than that, the ladies sound old, the bass player John just stands there (like he has for his entire career). Christine still looks youthful; an unsung MaryAnne next to Stevie's more often photographed Ginger. Christine remains a comely British school marm ready to spank your wrists for looking up her skirt, so that's one redeeming feature. Yet that small pleasure is offset by Mick's still googly eyes and the 1980s vest. Thanks for putting a camera right by Mick so that I can get scared out of my easy chair every time he stares those cue balls at the camera; nice touch for Halloween.

I wish I could say that Fleetwood Mac are rockers, but alas, they are little more than Lawrence Welk on steroids. Sure, Don't Stop pushes the metronome to 40 mph from Fleetwood Mac's usual school zone 20 mph pace, but seriously rip-snortin' rock and roll this just ain't, brothers and sisters. No matter how much Dolby 5.1 Surround and DVD fog-filtered quality you throw at this show, the music remains elevator quality drivel. The passge of time has, in my opinion, shown the Mac's music to be thinner than the veils around Stevie's midsection paunch.

I NEVER miss a concert. The fans were fabulous. I am a Miami girl, so Boston is not my favorite city! LOL!!  You Boston fans were great!

I decided to order it despite several reviewers' comments about the poor audio on this 2004 release.  I received it yesterday and watched it all the way through.  Although the video and editing are fine, the audio quality is just awful!  The sound is muffled and muddy...what a disappointment, especially with the audio technological tools available that could have made this a stellar concert DVD.

I should add that I played this concert through a Panasonic BD55 Blu-ray player connected to a McIntosh MX 136 pre/pro, McIntosh MC 402 amp, McIntosh MC 205 surround amp, balanced Audioquest interconnects (Columbia), Audioquest double biwire Rockefeller and Mont Blanc speaker cables, B&W 803S front speakers, B&W 804s rear speakers, B&W 600 series center, B&W ASW 700 sub, and Panasonic 58"" 850U HDTV.  Compared to other excellently recorded concert DVD's like Diana Krall's ""Live in Paris"" and ""Live in Rio"", Chris Botti, Dave Matthews, John Mayer ""Live in L.A."", and FM's ""The Dance"" concert DVDs, for example, the audio of ""FM Live in Boston"" DVD pales in comparison.

For me, the highlights of the ""FM Live in Boston"" concert include Lindsay B's guitar virtuosity, Stand Back, and Mick's drum solo.

I'm sure all know the story about the Tusk album costing $1 million dollars in production costs, resulting a $19.99 retail price upon release. (I guess it's the record buyer who has to pay for all the drugs.) And even when they performed live, Fleetwood Mac seemed to never get it right. Too remote. Too aloof. Too weird.

I delayed picking this item up for nearly two years but finally decided to take the plunge and I must say that I was not disappointed. The songs here are delivered with passion and energy in spite of the tremendous loss Pete and Roger had so recently suffered. The loss of John is noticeable, yes, and there is no way to replace such a unique player, but I feel the music of The Who is bigger than any one member, even Pete. Townsend and Daltry deserve to go on and their fans are all the luckier for this.

I saw this tour in Indianapolis and enjoyed the show, and I'm glad to see that it translated successfully to video. The camera angles are good, the editing is not too frenetic, and overall the look and sound of the DVD is very good.",1197590400,,845,4.121212121212121
2060167,3,B00023P4B0,"As a few other reviewers have noted previously, it was pretty evident to me that Stevie Nicks wanted to be someplace else other than on stage in Boston.  The body language and a complete lack of facial expressions pretty much says it all.  The contrast is simply amazing if any of you have seen the recent 2007 release of the Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers DVD that was recorded in Gainesville FL. Stevie was very good in that venue and a blind man could tell that she was having a great time and giving the audience what they had paid top dollar for.
I also was disappointed in the recording process of the FM concert. First off, the concert takes 2 DVD's to record the show and I'm not sure why that is.  When your watching the concert, I don't want to have to get up and change disc.  It interrupts the flow of the show.  Secondly, the camera shots are very few of the audience - other than from the back of the Fleet Center.  One does not get the energy from the crowd. I like to see shots from time to time of the audience ""groovin"" to the music.  The concert came across as rather flat to me.  Buckingham was great on the guitar and I think he tried to make up for the lack of energy being displayed by Nicks.  I've read other reviews here that indicated that there were other cities where they played where the energy displayed by the group was much better.  Why they didn't record some of these shows and pick from the best for the DVD is our loss for sure.
I guess the biggest disappointment for me is that this may very well be the last time FM goes on tour and it's a real shame that this could be the last permanent measure of their tours.
I give this DVD 3 stars as FM deserves that for the great music I've grown up for the last 30 years.  This is a group that belongs to a very small club of hugely sucessful bands that have endured, perservered and become a icon in the American music scene.  Very few share this club membership and I am glad that I am at an age where I can say ""Yeah, I grew up with Fleetwood Mac and they're my band.""",1197590400,4,2051,4.138539042821159

Easilly this is Lindsey's finest hour as he performs his epi ""I'm So Afraid"" and boy does that crowd love it.  I have seen him perform it live a few times but this by far has to be my favorite version.  The true master of the guitar and by the most under-appreciated musicians (if ever) is in top form here with a nearly 7 minute solo that is recieved by a minute and half standing ovation.

2060169,5,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac has aged.  Everyone is bearing their gray hairs but it is Lindsey Buckingham who bears the most notice.  He looks gray and almost grim loosing his youthful charisma that we saw last in the Chain.
  Nevertheless, I was pulled right into the obvious sweat and toil they exhibited on stage.  Everyone is trying their hardest to entertain.  They're not technically perfect but it works to their advantage.  The entire show exhibits raw energy.  Lindsey is doing everything he can with the electric guitar and Mick Fleetwood pours on the drums like he's eighteen.  There is a lot of commentary that without Christie McVie their is no band.  I have always enjoyed Christie's toe-tapping stanzas but that's all she gave.  She provided no layers to the songs.  They felt like bubblegum 80's pop.  Lindsey on the other hand is pushing envelopes and trying and experimenting and it grabs you.  Most of his music forces you to hear it a few times to absorb it all.  That to me is true Rock and Roll.  Paul Simon often forced you to do the same thing.  Speaking of which, Lindsey rips off Paul Simon's ""Kodachrome"" in his tune ""Peacekeeper.""

I loved ""The Dance"" as a marvelous comeback tour for a once great band, but ""Live in Boston"" without - Christine, just didn't quite drive the point home as to why they are still out there doing it all over again. Lindsay has an inspiring solo where he simply throws and slaps his guitar around, but he tries it several more times throughout the concert, and it just isn't the same, in fact, its tiring and a bit too despirate of an attempt at getting the crowd excited. Mick has his moments at the front of the stage with a percussionized vest, but what was the point on this long, drawn out ""solo""?

2060175,3,B00023P4B0,"The title of this CD can make it confusing to search for. Why? Because anyone who's a fan of the original Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac knows there already exists the legendary ""Live in Boston"" volume, recorded at The Boston Tea Party in early 1970 (when Stevie Nicks was still drawing faries and unicorns in her notebooks).  I love the early heavy blues Mac, but I can just imagine somebody buying that CD by mistake, expecting ""Rhiannon"", and getting ""The Green Manalishi"" instead. I almost wonder if the current band titled the CD ""Live in Boston"" as a nod towards their predecessors.

At any rate, the DVD here is pretty entertaining, showing that, with the help of some crack side-players, Fleetwood Mac can still deliver a solid and inspired show. Lindsey Buckingham has really not lost a step and is still at the top of his game as a player and singer. He's always been a great and under-rated guitarist, and he shows especially breathtaking skill on ""Big Love"" and ""Eyes of The World"". On the down-side, he can take himself a tad too seriously. He rarely smiles and his between-song banter can get pretty heavy. It's clear that not only does he pretty much run the show, but he's much more passionate when performing his own songs. When Stevie is doing her thing, you get the sense he's bored and just getting through the tune so he can get on to his next big number.

Stevie, on the other hand, has not improved since '97's luminous ""The Dance"" CD and video. Her versions of ""Rhiannon"", ""Dreams"", and ""Gypsy"" are performed by rote. She's pretty much on auto-pilot, and benifets heavily from the support of female back-up singers. ""Silver Springs"" is her best moment on this collection, but disappointingly, the sparkling, magical Nicks does not emerge here.

The absolute treat is Mick himself. Rock's greatest drummer is always the consumate performer, and always the clown. I hate drum solos unless it's a Mick Fleetwood drum solo. The highlight of the show is when he comes out front-of-stage and plays himself! His body has been wired up with trigger-pads, which play drum-sounds when hit. So as he slaps his chest and belly, it sounds like a kick drum, a snare, a conga, etc. Really fun! And of course the crowd goes wild.

Hugely missing from the new version of Fleetwood Mac is Chritine McVie, who retired a few years back. I am a big fan of her songs and her contribution the the band in thier prime. I miss her singing, keyboard playing, and especially her songs, which are completely ignored by Buckingham and Nicks (with the exception of ""Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow""). This is why ""Live in Boston"" often pales in comparison to ""The Dance"", despite being more electric and attempting to rock harder. I'd recommend this DVD/CD set for really hard-core Mac fans like myself.",1168300800,5,2797,4.746913580246914
2060186,5,B00023P4B0,"Even without the magical voice of Christine, this band is still the best on the planet.  Maybe I'm old and somewhat biased, but there's little that appeals to my age group anymore.  But these people have matured so beautifully as musicians and human beings, and the songwriting....well, that is where it all begins and ends.  Few bands share a history like this one.  The chemistry between Lindsey and Stevie onstage - the way they look at eachother - brought tears to my eyes.  Founders of the band, Mick and John, lay down a solid rhythmic foundation, while the additional backing musicians help replicate live, the intricate guitar work that Lindsey is famous for in the studio and the lush vocals.  Stevie has lost her upper range, but makes up for it in the emotion she delivers.  Lindsey's guitar work has to be seen and heard to be believed.  And he is the consumate showman, almost to the point of being a bit of a 'ham', but the audience eats it up.  This is a must for any Mac Fan.",1168214400,8,991,4.4916201117318435
2060187,3,B00023P4B0,"The quartet version of Fleetwood Mac hit the road not long after the release of SAY YOU WILL, and this deluxe set of two DVD's and one CD does a respectable job of serving as a permanent document of these shows.  Although the lovely-voiced Christine McVie will always be missed, the remaining members pull together surprisingly well into a tight, energetic unit.  The concert set is a bit too predictable for my taste, and most of the arrangements do not differ drastically from the studio versions, but this is perhaps to be expected.  In any event, these four individuals (all them well over 50 years old) still put on one hell of a show.

Some of the highlights from the show include Buckingham performing some of his brilliant, rarely-heard album tracks (""Eyes of the World,"" ""Second Hand News"") and Nicks' pulse-thumping performance of her 1983 solo hit ""Stand Back.""  The new material from 2003's SAY YOU WILL is seamlessly incorporated, with the gentle, hushed ""Say Goodbye"" (featuring Buckingham's phenomenal acoustic guitar playing) emerging as the emotional highpoint of the show.  The most pleasant surprise for me was Nicks' wrenching performance of 1979's ""Beautiful Child.""  This song has always been the best composition that Nicks has ever written in my opinion and her impassioned-yet-restrained performance will leave listeners wonder why the complex, intricate song is not considered among the Mac's very best recordings.

On the downside, some of the lengthy tags (which are too be somewhat expected in a concert) seem to go on forever, particularly in ""Come"" and ""World Turning"" - which are drug out far past the tasteful level.  There are also too many numbers that are performed in a manner identical to that of 1997's THE DANCE (""Dreams,"" ""Big Love,"" ""Landslide,"" ""I'm So Afraid,"" ""Silver Springs"") that feels as if the band was trying too hard to capture lighting in a bottle twice.  I would have personally rather heard some more rarely-performed material such as ""Crystal,"" ""I Know I'm Not Wrong,"" ""Storms,"" or ""Can't Go Back"" instead of so many retreads from THE DANCE.  I also didn't care for the lip-synched performance of ""Tusk"" - if the band couldn't effectively perform it without a large marching band, then the number should have simply been omitted.

Aside from these missteps, however, LIVE IN BOSTON is a good recording of a highly entertaining concert with many memorable moments.  The band is largely in terrific form, with Lindsey Buckingham especially in peak condition and finally becoming a fan favorite in his own right.  The sound quality is terrific and the video transfer is fine (although it is irritatingly presented in non-anamorphic widescreen), but the included ""highlights"" CD is disappointedly skimpy with only 10 tracks included.  This DVD/CD combo peaked at #84 on the Hot 200, which isn't bad for a pricey, multimedia package.",1161648000,14,2884,5.080508474576271
2060188,4,B00023P4B0,"Having been born at the end of the baby boom (42' to 63') it is so hard not to remember even now at the age of 42, that time, what it was like to grow up then with Fleetwood Mac. I will share, those unintrested, can skip, perhaps we were unique, because I was in a band, but our friends that used to attend our weekly parties surely have fond memories of the Mac.

I was 15-16 when Rumors came out, and the memories of Saturday nights, heading down to the Beer Distributor (Rumors blaring all the way there and back), buying the avg. 6-8 cases of beer (per person :), heading back to the house, kicking off the weekly Party with 30-50 of our closest friends, and continuing the party playing much of all their music in the weekly Jam session, (yea, along with CSN&Y Southern man, Skinnards Freebird, Black Sabbath, YES) were great memorys, and loss of many brain cells :) It was ALWAYS the Fleetwood Mac songs that everyone would cram in to the room where I was playing Drums, Jon on Lead Guitar, Bill on Base guitar, any of many we could get to pick up keyboards... and this was weekly for about 2 years!)

Now at 42, I saw ""The Dance"" DVD at a friends party. He had it playing on 2 wide screen TV's and a great sound system. That was it. The start of building a home theater to play that disc! 50"" & 42"" plasma later, 800 watts of Amplification at 7.1, fully digital and minus about $15K, it is mind blowing.  It brings back such great memories (The ones I remember :),

the Gas shortage, Paper shortage, Penny shortage, but no good music shortage.  In the 90's they dubbed the 70's era music, verses the 60's music revolution of the beatles as a ""Dead music Era"". WHAT??? Come along the next century, now you see people with bell bottoms, those 70's Jordache bells that were $60 then are $160 now.  Fleetwood Mac was a huge part of the 70's sound.  The Dance is hard to beat as far as capturing a decades old band in high quality video and audio, and the Boston Concert DVD does not make it.

Time. Age. But it is just another part of the few bands that were staples of the 60-70's.  Where the 70's bands referred to Influences from 50's and 60th's, many current bands reflect and poing out 70's bands that were their influencers.  The Boston Live DVD is a MUST for those that grew up

with Fleetwood Mac.  Fleetwood Mac are in that elite group of bands who are ""multi-decade"", but perhaps ""peaked in the 70's"".  Others The stones, The Who, Led Zep, and solo follow-on's, Aerosmith, all mainline bands, while Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, etc. were deemed Heavy metal, while others  Acid-Rock). Fleetwood Mac was always on the radio somewhere.

The Boston Live CD can be equated to the recent ""Yes"" release 35th anniversary.  It is YES, but they are older. I am so glad they survived 35 years and put out that DVD.  While Fleetwood Mac mostly survived,

and Nicks, who everyone had a crush on, is older, it is still Fleetwood Mac. Don't pass this DVD up.  If you have ""The Dance"", this is an automatic ""Must Buy"".  If it goes out of print, you will kick yourself some day.  YES 35 years later release taught me it is O.K. that they can't quite play ""Roundabout"" at the same tempo they could back in 1979, but it is still YES.  This is still Fleetwood Mac in concert, and I have enjoyed every live concert I attended, and I will enjoy this one on DVD having not been there in Boston to attend.

You can feel the sadnes all the way but also you can feel the passion as well. THE WHO (Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend), played with passion and grace for his friend, but they did not played any of John Entwistle s' songs. Why not play ""Trick of the Light""? or ""You""? or let the fans sing to ""Boris the Spider"" or ""My Wife""? I do feel that in the last few years, John Entwistle gave up to insist THE WHO to play his songs. He was not singing other songs other than ""My Wife"" or ""Boris the Spider"",neither he was doing chorus on Townshend songs. He neither gave the other two a new song to record for inclusion on ""Then and Now"". They recorded 3 new songs and released only two on that collection (the other is Roger Daltrey s' ""Certified Rose"").

""Live in Boston"" features THE WHO doing the same songs they have been doing in the last 30 years, with notable exceptions: ""THE RELAY"", ""SEA AND SAND"", ""ANOTHER TRICKY DAY"" and ""ANYWAY ANYHOW ANYWHERE"". The other songs are the overplayed ones, like the 200 version of WONT GET FOOLED AGAIN, I CAN EXPLAIN, SUBSTITUTE, PINBALL WIZARD, 5:15, BABA O RILEY, MY GENERATION, among other ""clasicc"" songs.

On this night, ZACK STARKEY does not sound so inspired as you can hear o see him in other spots on this tour. PINO PALADINO is superb, but he is not JOHN ENTWISTLE, thanks PINO anyway. SIMON TOWNSHEND, is almost inaudible, but he is there. And good old JOHN BUNDRICK is also there but only filling the holes, HE IS NOT JOHN CARIN, who in my opinion is the one they need as a keyboard player and producer.

It is about time also, that THE WHO, change their set list radicaly. Remember that the WHO sold million of albums not singles, after TOMMY, so we- the fans- know every song on the book. They should give a try to MUSIC MUST CHANGE, THE SEEKER, NAKED EYE, GOIN MOBILE, LET SEE ACTION, I AM ONE, DOCTOR JIMMY, THE ROCK, RELAX, SUNRISE, CIRCLES, TRICK OF THE LIGHT, YOU, SLIP KID, I HAVE KNOWN NO WAR, SONG IS OVER, and many many others (includin solo songs).",1140480000,2,2158,4.376558603491272

The band can still rock really hard, and on this performance we are treated to songs that we don't often hear live, like ""Another Tricky Day,"" ""Amazing Journey"" and ""Sparks.""  Pino handles the bass lines rather well, especially on the classic solos during ""My Generation.""  I was very impressed with every aspect this performance, and the video and sound quality are quite nice as well.

The bonus features on this DVD include interviews with Pete and Roger about their feelings on the tour, plus a collection of John Entwistles's artwork.  These are really interesting to watch.

The rendition of ""Tusk"" that they give here is dynamite; I love the happy faces that Fleetwood makes when he plays because those are the same faces I make when I listen to him. And Lindsey going nuts, jumping and dancing around like a loon was priceless.

I give four stars only because of this: I accidentally put in Disc Two before Disc One and was too lazy to get up and change discs.  Disc Two was just so freaking awesome that Disc One was a little disappointing.  But I still watch it - just not as much as the second part of the concert.

Mick Fleetwood is having a ball on drums.  You never saw a happier drummer.  In the first encore, World Turning, he gets the opportunity to shine and be the center of attention.  He's not a polished lead performer but he's having fun.

The concert is a bit too long.  It is broken into two disks, the first being an hour, the second nearly an hour and a half.

But, Ms. McVie did not want to continue touring so she left.  Fleetwood Mac decided to soldier on without her.  What they gave their fans was Say You Will.  The band toured from May 7, 2003 to September 14, 2004 and played more than 125 shows in support of Say You Will.  Two of those shows, September 23-24, 2003 in Boston, Massachusetts were recorded for the official DVD release ""Live in Boston"".

The set list was a combination of old favorites and new songs from Say You Will.  The problem with this is that there was, in my opinion, very little on Say You Will worth playing live.  One of the best songs from the record, Running Through the Garden, was played one time on opening night in Columbus, Ohio on May 7, 2003 and then dropped from the set list.

The Chain, Dreams, Eyes of the World, Second Hand News, Never Going Back Again, Rhiannon, Gypsy, Big Love, Landslide, Beautiful Child, Gold Dust Woman, I'm So Afraid, Silver Springs, Tusk, Stand Back, Go Your Own Way, World Turning and Don't Stop are all old classics while Peacekeeper, Say You Will, Come, Say Goodbye, What's the World Coming To and Goodbye Baby were brand new songs from Say You Will.

Eyes of the World became a peppier and more lively live track than it was back in 1982 which was a nice surprise.  Mick's short drum solo at the beginning is great and Lindsey's opening is fantastic.

World Turning and Don't Stop, two Christine McVie numbers, were a disappointment on this tour.  As much as I love Stevie Nicks, she just couldn't replace Christine McVie in singing Chris' parts on the songs.  Don't Stop was a big hit for Fleetwood Mac which is why I am assuming it was kept in the set list but what was the excuse for World Turning?  It wasn't a hit and the drum solo is just maddening!

Landslide is a song that, unfortunately, will probably remain in every Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks solo concert set list from now until eternity.  This song is so slow and stale now after all these years that it should really be retired and never thought of again (and the Dixie Chicks' horrid remake doesn't help it any).  About the only purpose for this song is to give the audience a chance to have an annoying little ""sing along"".  I must say, though, that Lindsey's guitar playing on Landslide is just beautiful every time.

Silver Springs was a holdover from the 1997 Dance tour.  But on this tour, it seemed to lose some of the passion and heart that it had six years before.  It was no longer the heartwrenching ballad of lost love that it was in 1997.  This time around it seemed as if it was just there to take up six minutes in the set.  All the emotion was gone.

Of the new songs, Peacekeeper, Say You Will and What's the World Coming To weren't bad live.  Say You Will is much better live than on the record because you don't have to suffer through the annoying kiddie chorus on the live version that you do on the record!

Say Goodbye would have been a much better song had they never opted to put any vocals by Stevie on it at all.  With just Lindsey playing and singing it would have been a sweet and delicate number with much more emotional impact.

Come should never have seen the light of day much less been put on Say You Will and played live.  This song is just a disgrace to Lindsey Buckingham's musical legacy as well as to the catalog of Fleetwood Mac.

The real standout in this show is Beautiful Child.  Fleetwood Mac adding this song to their live set list was one of the greatest gifts they could have given their fans.  This song is just purely beautiful, whether it is the Tusk album version or any live performance of it from 2003-2004.  This song was on the Say You Will tour what Silver Springs was on the Dance tour.  It was beautiful, passionate and full of emotion.

Sadly, the performances given by Fleetwood Mac for this show were less than what they are capable of.  Each and every member of the band is, or was, capable of giving a first-rate performance by putting all their heart and soul into each and every song.  It seemed here, though, that they were just going through the motions.  Stevie Nicks especially.  She didn't seem to really have any energy or desire to be there during the shows until she reached Stand Back.  Once that song was finished, her desire to be there seemed to fade away again.

Even Lindsey, who was hailed by so many as being the ""star"" of this tour didn't seem to be really taking it seriously.  His stage antics for this tour and DVD were often over-the-top and too wild to really be taken seriously.  Broken guitar strings (which it seemed he struggled and worked hard to break) and throwing the guitar down to run across the stage and dance wildly about don't make good performing.  This isn't the Lindsey Buckingham I have come to respect as a musician and enjoy throughout the years.  It was almost as if he knew this tour was the last big thing for Fleetwood Mac and he was going to go out in grand style instead of playing the shows gracefully the way he did in 1997.

But despite the lackluster performances and dull Say You Will songs the biggest problem with this DVD is the studio editing that was done to the recordings before they were released.

Instead of releasing a DVD of the performances exactly as they played them (which they should have done) this concert was heavily touched up in the studio.  You can even hear Christine McVie singing on Tusk!  And you don't have to listen hard to hear her.  Vocals from the Dance DVD were apparently laid right over the Boston vocals to ""enhance"" them.  It's a shame that whoever was doing the editing forgot that Christine was no longer a member of the band!

What Fleetwood Mac should have done was release an unedited DVD of the opening night in Columbus, Ohio.  They still had a complete set list and that show was fantastic!

If you're a die-hard Fleetwood Mac fan you will want this DVD to complete your collection.  If you can look past the faults it is a mildly enjoyable show.  But if you want a truly good performance by the band and you want to hear the ""classic"" sound of Fleetwood Mac, get the Dance DVD instead of Live in Boston.  You'll enjoy every second of the Dance and won't be sorry you bought it!",1123718400,16,6694,4.42962356792144
2060213,3,B00023P4B0,Well the two boys are still giving it their all and the sound and production of this DVD are excellent. It's not the same crew but we just need to be open to what is available...and it's damn good.,1123459200,3,197,4.076923076923077
2060214,5,B00023P4B0,"I had trepidations when I purchased this DVD. I wasn't sure if Pete & Roger could pull it off. They are no longer ""kids"" competing in a ""young mans"" rock & roll world. With the recent death of original bassist John Entwhistle, (on the eve of this tour) I wondered if they would be ""just going the the motions"". I was highly surprised and pleased to see they both put on a subperb highly energized concert, and proved your never too old to rock & roll. Something a lot of younger bands could take note on. Rounding out the band was Zak Starkey on drums (yes Ringo's kid) and Pino Palladino on bass, and longtime keyboardist, John 'Rabbit' Bundrik. Over 2 hours of original Who songs, all of which you will know, and DVD extras. All in all this was a good purchase, and a whole lot cheaper than the ticket I bought to see the band. Buy the DVD, you will be glad you did.",1121299200,7,868,4.234939759036145
2060215,5,B00023P4B0,"As Roger explains during his interview on this DVD, John Entwistle died only days before this tour kicked off.  Although this show in Boston was much later in the tour, it is very difficult to believe that he, Pete, and the rest of the band were able to pull it together so well.  I was a little hesitant to buy this at first knowing that John would be absent, but after reading the (for the most part) great reviews, I did so.  I am certainly glad I did.  The many pros outweight the few cons by a large margin:

PROS

-Fantastic sound quality, especially in 5.1 Surround

-Great camera work, with just enough movement from one member to the other without going overboard

-Enjoyable interviews with Roger and Pete, although Pete really seems to take himself very, very seriously sometimes.

-The set list.  Somewhat the same as Royal Albert Hall, but with some wonderful new additions (Love Reign O'er Me, Tricky Day, Sea and Sand--yes, I said Sea and Sand!!, Amazing Journey>Sparks).

CONS

-Intermittent ""swishing"" sound - it took me two watchings before I realized that it was coming from Roger's microphone when he swings it around.  I had never heard that on other videos.

-Roger definitely seems a little down.  Not that one could blame him, but it's still strange to not see him smiling all the time and interacting with the audience.

With that out of the way, I need to emphasize one more thing--the Amazing Journey>Sparks part of this concert could very well be the most explosive, exciting, and emotional performance I have ever witnessed out of Pete.  Although I have only been fortunate to see The Who in concert once, I am the proud owner of every video that I believe they have released (Kids are Alright, Live in America, Tommy Reunion Tour in '89, Isle of Wight, Royal Albert Hall).  Although he is (somewhat surprisingly) very active and enthusiastic during the whole show, Pete is simply out of his head great during these two songs, including what certainly appears to be a completely unplanned but genuine point where he stops playing and just gets into it with the crowd during the climax of Sparks.  Absolutely beautiful.  You need to get this DVD just for that performance alone.",1114732800,20,2206,4.725130890052356
2060216,5,B00023P4B0,"This DVD will send chills down your spine when you hear the band perform some of our absolute favorites of all time.

2060217,4,B00023P4B0,"I finally got my new DVD player over the weekend and this 2002 show from Boston was the test drive.

I saw the Who (finally) in '02 at Hersheypark, and it was a fantastic show.  This performance was the exact same set, so I got a close up look at what I didn't see from the back of the arena!

Daltrey seemed to labor little bit at times, but this was near the end of the tour and pushing 60, I dare anyone to try and do what he did...also he said in the bonus section that he couldn't hear much due to the PA being overridden.  I can understand that.

Townshend's guitar work was nothing short of spectacular.  Enough said.

The backing band was solid, Pino Palladino filling in nicely (though Entwistle can never be replaced);  Zak Starkey, John Bundrick and Simon Townshend all did great.

A good document of what now appears to be a pivotal time for the Who, as they consider new material.  Can't wait.",1112486400,5,906,4.3076923076923075
2060218,5,B00023P4B0,"When I viewed this DVD, I was in tears due to the fact that I had not witnessed such a fabulous concert in so many years.  Frankly, I was shocked at the greatness that was exhibited in an era when music is only about looks and the money.

dditionally, Fleetwood Mac is not nor ever has been my favorite band.

However, after viewing Lindsey Buckingham live I was floored.  The guy is the closest thing to Jimi Henrix I have ever heard.  Obviously, we all know he is grossly underrated.

I would advise anyone who loves music to watch this and see a real player in action.  You will not be disappointed.  His humility in today's society is a rarity which makes him even more awesome.

2060220,4,B00023P4B0,"A solid video of Daltrey and Townshend in transition, trying to recover from the emotional, spiritual and physical loss of the greatest bass guitarist on Earth. Not as explosive as ""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" or ""The Kids Are Alright"" due to the Ox's absence, of course, the new video is a fairly accurate document of the 2002 tour. Yes, Pino is no John, but Pino did an admirable job of not mimicking his predessor. (The Who's second drummer, Kenney Jones, also should be given a high-five for not aping Moon in 1979-1982 and at Live Aid in 1985). And to the guy below who says that Zak ""sucks,"" it's obvious you're not a drummer. Zak doesn't suck at all. He was on fire in Dallas in 2000 with Entwistle. Zak probably reigned in his playing a pinch or two during the filming of the Boston DVD due to a new bassist (Pino) on board for the tour. After all, the Boston gig was pretty early on in the tour schedule. The Who in 2002 was still better than The Stones, although John Entwistle and Keith Moon always will be missed by us long-time fans. I wish they'd release a video of the 2000 Dallas-Reunion Arena show. At least I still have the audio from that stellar show, proving that Zak doesn't stink on the skins.

2060221,3,B00023P4B0,"The Who is my favorite band of all time.  The Royal Albert Hall concert, with Entwistle, is far superior to this retread performance.  That DVD was better filmed and edited, and had the added excitement of some special guests.

This one trots out the same warhorse songs they've played over the last six tours, with some sorry sounding songs from the anti-Who albums ""It's Hard"" and ""Face Dances"".

The boys would do better to mine ""Who By Numbers"" for some songs to play live.

Roger's voice is a bit gravelly.  Pete is okay.  Get ""Royal Albert Hall"" to see the original punks in much better form.  Get Live at the Isle of Wight or The Kids Are Alright to see the best rock and roll bad ever.",1107129600,2,693,4.4015748031496065
2060222,4,B00023P4B0,"I attended a concert on this tour and remember specifically purchasing a ticket in advance to be on the left side of the stage to see Entwistle up close.  Needless to say there was disappointment and sadness learning of his death in Las Vegas at the beginning of the tour.

I don't agree that this was one of the best concerts from that year as I have listened to The Who box set from this tour and/or was at the concert.

My top three concerts from that year were:

1) Grand Rapids  2) New York  3) Toronto

Boston was a strong showing as well, but I got the feeling from watching this DVD that a lot of the dialogue was edited (I happen to like the dialogue between songs, it's entertaining and puts the song into a unique context).

I also agree that the video editing doesn't do justice to the live concert . . . but I really don't think any typical edit is adaquate.  From watching them live I think the best way to shoot them is to just set a panoramic camera somewhere in the center and just leave it. They're up there competing for your attention and having an editor choose for you is annoying.

And what ever happened to DVD support for multi-angle functions...why couldn't they take advantage of this like they did on the Royal Albert Hall DVD?

I was also disappointed that the DVD didn't contain a long Pete solo during 5'15 such as the one he performed at the Grand Rapids concert.  This is a perfect example of how good Pete was playing, and how he was stepping up his performance to keep the concert rocking.  If you watch the Live at Royal Albert Hall DVD, Entwistle gave a jaw-dropping bass solo during 5'15.  At the Grand Rapids concert from this year, Pete gives an incredible guitar solo at the same point in the song when John would normally come in and wow the audience.

Yes there is diappointment because Entwistle isn't there, but as Pete said at the time ""I feel like I'm playing better than I have in years"".  You can tell this by this DVD, and it was even more evident from the live concerts.  For those of us who went to some  of these concerts, this is a worthwhile souvenir.  Even if you weren't there this is a great DVD concert.  Pete and Roger worked great together and Pete's playing and even his voice (as Roger points out on the DVD) were outstanding.  Pino's bass is simple but solid nonetheless, reminiscent of John's early recordings with the Who (esp. on ""My Generation"").  He stands in the corner, plays the bass and plays it well, doesn't do anything showy, and provide great support as a good bass player should.

For those with no interest in the 2002 tour, I recommend Live at Royal Albert Hall for the ""later years"" of the Who.",1105747200,9,2675,4.381338742393509
2060223,5,B00023P4B0,"I love Stevie Nicks as much as the the next fan and she is an integral part of this band, but let's be honest here, without the musical genius of Lindsey, there would be no Stevie Nicks and she knows it so why doesn't everyone else? Actually, there would be no Fleetwood Mac. Period. If you don't think so, consider this: When he left the band in the 80s' they needed TWO guitarists to replace him - and they soon folded like a house of cards. Where are those guitarists now? Do you know? Do you care? Didn't think so. Lindsey is without question one of the most underappreciated musical geniuses in popular music in every conceivable way - and the fact that supposed ""Fleetwood Mac fans"" would write a review and not mention him is scandalously incompetent and insulting. His guitar work is nothing less than breathtaking, whether it's bluegrass finger-picking or screaming electrical chords - and you get all of that on this DVD. The live acoustic version of Big Love is one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen and I'm still picking my jaw up off the floor. On top of that, he's a gifted composer and vocalist. In every song, you hear nothing but exquisite melodies dripping from his guitar chords and he sings like it he means it - with unequivocal emotion. Even Stevie has said that Lindsey is the magic behind her best tunes. Listen to her solo music and then her Mac tunes and you really appreciate his subtle, but fluid guitar work. Christine's absence in this concert is bittersweet. Her smoky voice is indeed missed, but then it gives Lindsey the room he needs to really loosen up and expand. I do wish Stevie had performed more of her newer material like Silver Girl and Illume instead of Stand Back. Both are very haunting and sound like vintage Stevie. But her rare performance of Beautiful Child is a gem that can't be overlooked. I was hoping she too would loosen up more, but sometimes she seems uncomfortable on stage - like she doesn't know what to do with herself.  But that's minor quibbling.  I was fortunate to see this show in Worcester, MA and was blown away by it then. A year and half later, seeing the details and facial expressions that I couldn't see in person and the explosive chemistry between these two performers, I am still blown away. Say Goodbye is a sad and touching duet that will remind real music lovers that THIS is what great music and artistic integrity is supposed to sound like.",1105056000,25,2437,4.548974943052392
2060224,3,B00023P4B0,"The Who's 2002 tour got rave reviews, and their September 28th show in Boston was cited by Matt Kent as one of the highlights.
Sadly, you would never know that by looking at this DVD. The blame must fall with the editors. It seems that they were simply not close enough to the material.
For instance, most concert DVDs naturally focus more on the singer than the players. This works for most bands, but not the Who. The excitement of a Who show has always stemmed mainly from Pete Townshend's kinetic performances. Unfortunately, the editors here spend more time on Daltrey.
Indeed, the viewer misses Townshend's grand entrance on ""Baba O'Riley,"" because the camera is busy following Daltrey. Absent as well are Townshend's ferocious windmills at the end of ""Who Are You"", and his prodigious playing during most of ""Relay"".
When the editors are finally forced to focus on Townshend - during songs like ""Eminence Front"", in which he sings the lead lines, and ""Sparks"", a mostly instrumental number - some incredibly energetic music is captured. The latter includes some very cool ad-lib lyrics, by the guitarist.
In regards to John Entwistle, he is missed greatly, of course, but Pino Palladino is a perfectly competent and even exciting bassist in his own right.
I think the bootleg DVDs of the tour - particularly Candem and the Greek Theatre ultimately hold up better.
It's too bad. This could have been really good.",1104969600,3,1418,4.8879668049792535
2060225,4,B00023P4B0,"At first, I was a little skeptical when I found out that Fleetwood Mac was releasing another live set - ""Fleetwood Mac - Live in Boston"".  There were two reasons for my skeptism:  1) It was only back in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac had released ""The Dance"" on CD and Video.  This was an incredible effort by the band and I thought this was going to be very difficult to top;  2) Christine McVie had departed the band and I just didn't know whether or not the remaining four members could pull things off or not.  The good news is that Fleetwood Mac pulls through once again.  They find a way to carry on without Christine McVie and produce a solid live performance.  In fact, the level of showmanship comes very close to ""The Dance"".

Fleetwood Mac's ""Live in Boston"" is actually a 3 disc set.  Two discs are DVDs and the third disc is a CD.  The two DVDs are actually from a concert done at the Fleet Center in Boston.  This performance was also broadcasted on PBS' ""Soundstage"" series.  The DVDs present the full concert - in its entirety and in the order that it was performed.  The PBS Broadcasts were 1 and 2 hour subsets - each of the subsets are reordered.  You probably will still want this collection even if you have seen the PBS set.  The DVD set provides the continuity and magic that Fleetwood Mac delivered that particular evening.

This would be a 5 star collection if it weren't for the CD.  I found the CD to be a big disappointment.  The CD contains only 10 of the 24 songs.  In 2003, the progressive Rock band Rush released a DVD and CD of their 2002 Rio concert entitled ""Rush in Rio"".  ""Rush in Rio"" was originally intended to be a DVD set, but since the band found some ""magic"" with the performance, they also decided to release the performance on audio CD - in the exact order and flow that was on the DVD.  It would have been nice if Fleetwood Mac had done the same.  They clearly have ""magic"" with the DVD set, but the CD is basically a bunch of live songs.  The live songs have been somehwat reordered and you don't get a lot of the spoken words said by the band members.  While Rush released the DVD and CD separately, the Fleetwood Mac package includes both.  Another note on the CD - they could have clearly fit more than ten songs on the collection.  If you get ""Live in Boston"", get this for the DVD and not the CD.

Since Christine McVie has departed - the playset doesn't include many of her songs that had her vocals.  Therefore, much of the weight on falls on Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, and Mick Fleetwood to make the show go on. (John McVie as always, lays low in the background doing what he does best - playing Bass).  Lindsey is going to provide some incredible guitar work on songs such as ""Come"", ""Big Love"", ""I'm So Afraid"", and Tusk.  Stevie Nicks gets an opportunity to do one of her solo songs - ""Stand Back"".  Mick Fleetwood even gets a chance to do some ""ramblings"" during a drum duet he performs on stage.  The band also gets an opportunity to perform some songs that haven't been done in a long time live - ""Eyes of the World"", ""Never Going Back Again"", ""Beautiful Child"",  and ""World Turning"".  The band also performs several new songs from the ""Say You Will"" album.  These include: ""Peacekeeper"", ""Come"" (definitely the best of the new work), ""Say Goodbye"", ""What's the World Coming To"", and ""Goodbye Baby"".

The highlight of ""Live in Boston"" is going to be the performance of ""Stand Back"".  It was great to see Fleetwood Mac do this.  The song starts out with a two minute percussion intro.  During the concert, Fleetwood Mac brings in a great set of tour muscians.  One of the musicians who really steals the show (especially in the second half of the show) is percussionist Taku Hirano.  Hirano leads the two minute percussion which then explodes into the start of ""Stand Back"".  Stevie delivers the song with lots of intensity and trademark twirls.

""Silver Springs"" was the song on ""The Dance"" that stole the show.  It's back on here.  There was a lot of emotion during this song between Lindsey and Stevie on ""The Dance"".  This time, ""Silver Springs"" has a slightly quicker tempo toward the end.  It doesn't quite live up to what was done on ""The Dance"", but it is still something you'll want to play over and over.  There isn't any loss of emotion between Stevie and Lindsey on ""Landslide"".

""Tusk"" is back and better than ever.  On ""The Dance"", Fleetwood Mac utilized the USC Marching Band and it gave the song a whole new twist.  This time, Fleetwood Mac uses a Marching Band again, but this time uses a pre-recorded track.  However the song has no loss in entertainment value.  Lindsey is going to really steal the show when he goes into a bizarre kind of dance, then will go and do an embraced dance with Stevie.

One thing to note, Mick Fleetwood does an incredible drum duet with Hirano during ""World Turning"".  It features some terrific rambling vocals and Fleetwood even gets out from behind the drum set.  It's great stuff.  Following that song, the band does ""Don't Stop"".  This is the only Christine McVie vocals song included - Stevie Nicks steps in flawlessly and delivers Christine's vocals.

The collection includes some very thin liner notes.  They do list the songs with songwriting credits.  The stage and production credits are included as well.  The packaging is kind of cheap (cardbox box as opposed to jewel case). Overall, it's another solid live set by Fleetwood Mac.  As mentioned above, the CD is the disappointment - but the DVD set alone is worth the price of this collection.",1104624000,10,5564,4.513026052104208
2060226,5,B00023P4B0,"Stevie's performance of Beautiful Child alone would make this DVD/CD set worth purchasing.  Beautiful Child is one of those hidden treasures that deserved to be heard and now it is.

Yes, the band is older.  No, Stevie doesn't twirl as much and can't kick her foot higher than her head anymore...but who cares.  The band's music and Stevie & Lindsey's voices are as strong as ever.

If the band needs to prove anything, they do!  They prove that they can sing their classic songs with older, wiser voices and they prove, with their new songs, they they still have what it takes to touch their audience.

I have only one disappointment and it concerns the packaging of this DVD/CD set.  There is only 1 song on the CD that isn't a classic.  I think the CD should have been filed with the live versions of their newest songs because I'm sure Mac fans have numerous live versions of the classics already.",1104451200,8,901,4.546583850931677

2060228,5,B00023P4B0,"I read a review on here where somebody described Stevie Nicks as ""pear shaped"" and this is so shallow. FYI Ms. Nicks lost over 70 pounds and now weighs 125 pounds. She did this with no drugs, and slowly and steadily the past few years. No liposuction, no diet pills, she has simply remained on the Atkins diet and is healthy, drug free, and nicotine free. She is 5'1, so at 125, she has a little bit of hips, but give the lady a break. She is a singer/songwriter, a rock icon and the only female rock artist that STILL sells millions of cd's and sells out tours for 30 years and counting. Stevie is NOT a fashion model, she is an artist, so passing cruel comments regarding her weight is shallow and has nothing to do with the music, which, obviously, millions still enjoy. Unlike other females approaching 60, Stevie doesn't have that stretched out plastic surgery, or rely on trends to stay popular. Nicks is adored by her loyal fans because of her music. While she doesn't have the range of, lets say, a Pat Benatar, she excells with the most emotional sounding voice in rock. The songs she has written are classic rock staples, her image never changes, and she remains true to herself and her loyal fans. Like it or not, Stevie Nicks has lasted longer in terms of record and concert sales than any female rock star in history(sans Tina Turner, but Tina is not straight-up Rock and roll all the time).If being 125 pounds qualifies a person as ""pear shaped."" then the person who wrote that cruel comment needs to realise Nicks is a singer, and not a model. Besides, she is a very very good looking woman, an amazing singer and writer, has her own style of wardrobe and a hypnotic stage presence. 30 years later, she obviously created a genre of her own that seems to never bore her fan base. As for Buckingham, give him a break--he is an amazing guitarist and producer. As a member of Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks is a potent part of this band. As a solo artist, she proved to be a mega selling artist and one of the few that balanced a popular solo career while maintaining her position as a member of a major band(Fleetwood Mac).Regarding the few negative reviews of this concert, I do not agree. One person says the performers smiles are missing here. I watch this concert dvd over and over and love it and see a LOT of smiling amongst the band, plenty of energy and certainly no evidence of a tired band simply going through the motions. Bad editing? I found the camera work and editing wonderful. The sound qualty is amazing, the set list has new songs, rare songs and classics. Ths is a band who always have been able to combine great rock and roll with great melodies and an animated stage show that does not rely on special effects. And Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are one of the best rythym sections of any band in history. No matter how many people try and diss this band simply because they are older now, it will never stop the millions of fans who appreciate and love this music. If you enjoy Stevie and the Mac, buy this dvd set. It is another classic performance by one of the most succesful rock and roll bands in history.",1103155200,16,3141,4.426597582037997

THEY DID HIRE TOP NOTCH MUSICIANS, PINO PALLIDINO(BASS), A GREAT FRETLESS PLAYER(PAUL YOUNG, DON HENLEY), AND ZAK STARKEY(DRUMS). THE KEYBOARDIST AND SECOND GUITARIST ALSO SOUNDED FINE.

2060230,4,B00023P4B0,"I am a huge and passionate Fleetwood Mac fan. I was lucky enough to see this last 'Say You Will Tour' 6 times throughout 2003 and 2004. My last concert being May 23, 2004 in Jacksonville, FL. where  I had the great opportunity of being front row, and interacting with the band (playing Lindsey's guitar and much more)- technically I actually had 3rd row tickets, but security let the first 4 rows move up front and stand at the stage.

  I was greatly anticipating the release of this DVD set. I purchased it on the day of its release, and  I still love it..in fact I actually watched it about an hour ago.

  I will start off with what I love about this DVD, and later get into what I do not love.

  First off it's just great to have a new DVD since the Dance video. It's also great to have a video filmed from an actual concert, compared to the Dance when the crowd was invite only.

  Lindsey Buckingham is portrayed best here, and his wildness on stage is really shown. I felt it at the concerts and I could feel it watching this DVD as well. He has proved himself to be a musical genius. You really get a sense while watching what he's actually like in concert.

  Stevie Nicks, through all her criticisms that every video performance receives her...shines. She has always been deeply scrutinized, especially when performing live. Some fans and especially critics have it in their heads that this 56 year old woman (55 when this was taped) should be EXACTLY like she was in 1975 screaming her vocal chords out to RHIANNON.. I guess you would like her to still be on drugs as well??

  Anyway...'Say Goodbye' is one of the highlights of the DVD. It is a new song from their SAY YOU WILL CD, and this live performance is much better than the album version. The way they perform it live, is somewhat slower than the album version. Stevie's voice is so delicate in this song, and this is one of the intense moments of the set.

  'Beautiful Child' has been one of the highlights of this tour. Never performed live until this current tour, it is truly a delight to hear. Stevie Nicks sings this tune with such intensity , while watching you feel like you are sitting in her home watching her sing it for the first time.

  Stevie gives her trademark ""GOLD DUST WOMAN"" scream, and wears her trademark gold shawl.  She even breaks out her cream colored high heeled platform boots of days gone by for GYPSY.

  ""Come"" another song from SAY YOU WILL, really shines on this DVD as well. Although Lindsey doesn't play a whole lot of guitar in this song, he focuses much more on his crazed screaming and intense flirting with the ladies in the front row. The backing band really deserves credit for the incredible music in this song. Carlos Rios, and Neale Heywood play some incredible and hard pounding electric guitars in this one.  While Mick's drumming is great, Steve Rinkov's backing drumming is what makes this particular song. Also we cannot forget ""the backbone of Fleetwood Mac"" John McVie on bass, which is very prominent in ""COME.""

  Another highlight is Stevie Nicks' solo hit ""STAND BACK."" I have been reading the reviews her, and I too think her performance was superb. It is a moment within the show that really allows Stevie to rock out. Many of her Fleetwood Mac tunes are not what one would call ""upbeat"" songs, so this solo addition to the site really adds a lot to the show. You get to see her do her classic twirls, here. During Stand Back she probably twirls about 10 consecutive times, gives a few kicks and does all that famous dancing Stevie Nicks is known for, love it or hate it!

  Stevie dedicates ""LANDSLIDE"" to her former lover and band-mate Lindsey Buckingham, and she performs a memorable rendition of this classic.

  ""TUSK"" is another musical performance which the backing band deserves much credit. This is another tune which Lindsey plays little guitar, opting for another crazed vocal and stage performance instead. The USC Marching band is not here, but their horns are nicely sampled in via today's new technology. A video of the USC Marching Band is also shown in the background during the song. You get to watch Lindsey yell ""TUSK"" ""TUSK"" and then chase Stevie Nicks around the stage as they perform a mock boxing match.

  Now, my disappointments with this set. The editing, the editing, the editing is all that needs to be said. This show was filmed over two consecutive nights - Sept 23 (with an invite/winners only crowd of 1000 lucky fans) for closeup purposes as well as audio, as well as the actual concert on Sept 24 - both at the Fleet Center.  This is all fine and dandy, except those who edited failed to do a great job in putting this all together. Once in ""RHIANNON"" Stevie's vocal continues for about 1 sec after her face is away from the mic. This is a problem caused by filming over two nights, and not watching little mistakes like that.

  I agree with a previous reviewer that there is too much camera cutting in certain songs, that are not even fast songs. In slow songs the camera should be a little more ""Steady"" and focus on one thing, rather than jumping all over the stage. It makes it have a much less intimate feel. I agree also that there is not much point in all the long distance shots. We KNOW they draw a huge crowd of 20,000 + and a couple of nice crowds shots would have done it. It seems as if the editers wanted to remind everyone of the size of the crowd, except in THE MIDDLE OF SONGS.

  The sound is great, except sometimes it seems to fluctuate. In slow songs like ""SAY GOODBYE"" Lindsey's guitar seems to get louder in some parts, where it really doesn't do that in the actual concert. I feel the need to turn the tv down a little in certain parts. However, overall the audio mixing is great and the sound is pretty tight.

  Another little problem I have is this being 2 DVD's. Certainly it could have all fit on one DVD, as did the Dance video which still had superb quality (I would say a little better quality than  this DVD)..Was the purpose so the price could be jacked up? Well, I dunno that's for everyone to decide. Regardless, it's pointless for this to be a 2DVD set...it kind of interrupts the show if you are watching the concert in its entirety to have to change discs in the middle.

  Overall I was quite satisfied with this DVD. I strongly recommend it to those who love this great band. It has it's technical problems, but the band is superb. The sound is incredible for the most part, the video is the only rough part at times. The packaging is nice...although most of the pictures in the booklet are not actually from THIS particular concert, that's ok.  I would say even without Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac managed to really shine. This tour was the 3rd highest grossing tour of 2003, and there's a reason. THEY ROCK!",1101600000,97,6820,4.480551053484603
2060231,4,B00023P4B0,"Overall this is a quite enjoyable concert film.  It is very ""watchable"" vis--vis the manner in which it was filmed, camerawork, etc.  You feel like you are watching an actual live concert, rather than some overproduced two-hour music video.

Pete and Rog are in good form, as is the rest of the band.  Bassist Pino Paladino does a good job playing the songs, but John is still sorely missed, of course.  If you try to think of it as a ""Daltrey/Townshend"" show and just enjoy it on the same level as Zeppelin fans would a Page & Plant show, John's absence might be a bit more bearable.  The bass could stand to be a bit louder in places, too.

The song selection is good, albeit not radically different from the 2000 tour.  For what it's worth, some visuals shown on screens during the concerts are not apparent on the DVD, but the band's performance is certainly enough to carry the show.  Interesting interview segments and a gallery of Entwitsle's artwork also make this one worth getting.

""Live in Boston"" is a worthy addition to anyone's video or Who collection.  For anyone who finds John's absence too distracting, get the John Entwistle Band Live DVD and watch that one too.",1099526400,4,1182,4.607655502392345
2060232,5,B00023P4B0,"There is truly nothing like The Who LIVE. My first concert ever (I'm only 18) was to see The Who perform at the Tweeter Center on September 27, 2002 where this DVD is from. It was one of the greatest moments in my life to see Roger and Pete onstage! I do wonder however what it would have been like with Keith and John up onstage too. Probably unbelievable!

Anyways this Concert DVD is amazing! I remember seeing the show live and I was blown away. The sound quality is wonderful and Pete sure can play his guitar! I really enjoy this DVD because I think the Who is one of thee best live bands out there and if you never of had a chance to see the who live, then purchase this DVD and watch it! For any Who fan you should at least watch this DVD to ""experience"" the live who. Also the interviews with Roger and Pete are worth the entire price of the DVD.",1099526400,3,855,4.089285714285714
2060233,5,B00023P4B0,"This concert is one of the saddest Rock and Roll events I have ever witnessed. Not because the band is not playing well- they are. But every moment is tinged with the sadness of having lost a great friend, and our realization that a wonderful rock and roll personality has been removed from the world. John  Entwistle died from taking cocaine, and by all standards that was a stupid act of selfishness. Leaving his mates in the lurch in the middle of a tour- John, John, John, defintely bad form at best. The pain, the sadness is evident in every closeup, between the songs, and in the music itself. Listen to Townsend's tortured guitar licks and Daltry's strangled singing and you will know this is a group of friends in deep mourning. The music though is fantastic, even though they occasionally get out of synch, particularly Zak Starkey, but it doesn't matter. Anything on this night that might be a mistake is forgiven by their fans, and at times the music soars and reaches the heights seen and heard by Who fans in years past when the sound of The Who roared like a lion in the jungle. And like the Lion, The Who are still the Kings of The Rock and Roll world, and even in death will continue to reign.",1099094400,16,1209,4.445945945945946
2060234,4,B00023P4B0,"It was a difficult decision for Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend to carry on with The Who's 2002 Summer tour after John Entwistle died on the eve of the opener in Las Vegas.  The shows became, in part, a tribute to the late bassist.  Roger and Pete carried on despite their loss of their friend, and the Boston show on this DVD proves that ""The Two"" can still make some powerful music together.

I think it'd be a mistake to review this DVD song by song; the concert itself is wonderfully paced and builds momentum as it goes along.  Roger's vocals are quite good, and Pete's guitar playing is inspired.  The rest of the band (John ""Rabbit"" Bundrick on keyboards, Pete's brother Simon on guitar and backing vocals, Pino Palladino on bass and Zak Starkey on drums) are tight.  There are a couple of exchanges between the band and a fan who's getting under Pete's skin; this adds a bit of tension to the air.  For me, the concert's high points are ""My Generation"", ""Amazing Journey"" and ""Sparks"".

It would have been nice to have had a video tribute to John on this DVD (there is a series of his drawings presented as a bonus feature), and wide screen would have been nice.  The Who released CDs of this summer tour straight from the sound board in 2002; if you bought one or more of these, you will be pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed in the concert.",1098576000,4,1403,4.4453125
2060235,5,B00023P4B0,"In 1982, a video came out called ""The Who Rocks America,"" which documented the band's farewell tour.  This film was shot twenty years later, and the Who can still rock.  Pete does more of his classic windmill in this performance, and the band as a whole still sounds just as exciting.  The inclusion of ""Just Another Tricky Day"" was nice; it is great to see oddities as well as old favorites.  Pino Palladino is a good bass player, though he will never replace John.  I've always loved the Who, and this film is a great addition to any Who collection.  Also recommended is the Royal Albert Hall DVD.",1098403200,9,599,4.5
2060236,4,B00023P4B0,"One nitwit wrote that there was no energy.  What?  What planet were you on?  I saw them early in their tour in San Diego, and I was blown away by the power and emotion.  Lindsey was a wildman he had so much energy!",1098403200,5,214,3.9069767441860463
2060237,2,B00023P4B0,"This DVD shows the Who to be a shadow of their former selves. The same old songs are wheeled out yet again, but this time the absence of John Entwistle really shows the band to be a spent force. One can't blame them for taking the opportunity to make money if they can, but the fact that there is no creativity whatsoever evident is saddening. From rock pioneers to a golden oldies act, what a shame. There is the promise of a new album, but as Daltrey makes plain in his interview this will at best result in 4 new songs in the golden oldies set.

It is a pity that the band doesn't release some good archive footage,as per last year's Led Zeppelin package, to remind the world what a great band they were in their day. As with the band's own Encore CD releases of every concert performance of recent years, this DVD serves only to document a band well past it's sell by date. If only the marketing effort was put into releasing classic era material. Serving up ever diminishing quality performances on video coupled with repeated greatest hits audio releases will only damage the band's reputation further.

For completist's only - for all others I recommend buying The Kids Are Alright or 30 Years Maximum R&B DVDs. For those keen on the more recent outings of the band, I recommend the Royal Albert Hall concert from 2000. The Who was always about the interplay between the musicians and each person's unique style developed as a part of the whole, which always exceeded the sum of its parts. Had Entwistle not been a virtuoso bass player they might have managed to overcome his loss. However, without the dynamic between Townshend and Entwistle it no longer really makes much sense as the pieces don't fit. If they put half as much energy into being creative as they do pretending to be the act that they once were, we might have something to look forward to.",1098057600,10,1864,4.528189910979228

  It is so sad about us not hearing your input in THE

WHO's ""LIVE IN BOSTON"". You were ""The Quiet One"" behind your booming bass, a steadfast Ox, lionized by rock fans and critics, and you proved that THE WHO's mighty ""Success Story"" could be graced with humility surrounded by anarchy and millions of pounding dollars. Your loss has almost turned your fans into

""WHISKEY MEN"" as THE WHO fiddle about half-assed on this average

live album - by their numbers' standards. ""IT'S HARD"" to take.

  Now,""It's Your Turn"" to be the focus of THE WHO's latest eminent front line battles: but unlike Keith you slipped innocent as a kid through this ""Heaven And Hell"" into (as Townshend once said) ""beyond the beyond.""

  We know you had not ""Had Enough"". If only someone had

been coming earlier we would still have the Hendrix of bass guitar players. Still waters run deep in this ""Dangerous"" world and you anchored the flying WHO even when they'd spent everything like your character ""Silas Stingy"" many decades ago. Your spirit and bass had progressed with THE WHO's magic in each generation's eyes. You were better you bet than any other bass

player - so when this album's songs were over, I was left with

only tears. Even this album's ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" version

didn't move me. Probably because this new WHO sounded strange

and its cobwebbed 60's songs lacked energy.

  Now like ""Boris The Spider"" you've been silenced beneath life's hard knocks and like Pete's guitars our hearts were broken, but the only lonely consolation is that you are with Keith, in a lifehouse where nothing is everything and you are still, still playing your bass. Down here, ""LIVE IN BOSTON"" is ""Melancholia"" as the rock world misses one of its truly

great artists on what should have been your 60th birthday. Rock is dead they say; now it's up to Pete and Roger to make it live today. John you were ""One Of A Kind"". May ""Love Reign Over You.""

Whoever decided to put this out should have picked a better concert to market.  It is wonderful to have a memento of the concerts that I enjoyed over the last two years.  I think what drags this package down is the CD.  Come on, it's the same songs marketed over and over again.  Is this a marketing ploy to sell many?  Most of the people that would consider buying this are probably going to be people who are true fans and wanted to hear songs other than what shows up on every greatist hits and compilation CDs!  The gang played plenty of songs in the concert that would have been suitable for the companion CD.  Too bad the 2004 concert song list didn't make it.  I Know I'm Not Wrong would have been awesome.

2060240,5,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac still kick major portions of ass, I'm lucky enough to have witnessed this in the flesh during their recent tour. I have to say, I think Fleetwood Mac are at a definite high point in their career right now, particularly Lindsey Buckingham. Thank God for Lindsey's return! It seems that he has become the star of the recent Fleetwood Mac shows to some extent (no disrespect to Stevie, who, more often than not, can still put on a very good show). Do not listen to the naysayer's and miserablists out there who mistake charisma and showmanship and TALENT for an inflated ego. This is quite simply not the case. But then, some people are cursed with a rather limited capacity for music appreciation and for not being bitter and twisted. I know it's the popular thing to dis any band more than 20 years old for being washed up or whatever, but the creative energies of Fleetwood Mac have plenty of vitality left.

I have to say that the sound of the DVD is pretty good, the stereo mix just right, but the performance is just a little subdued (given the circumstances, that's understandable). Roger and Pete give it everything they've got, but I wish Rabbit would just play tambourine during some of the early numbers instead of keyboards, Zak is good but not as dynamic as on the ""Concert For New York (2001)"" DVD, and Simon Townshend is kind of a fifth wheel you don't notice much (""Along for the ride"", as Pete puts it in his interview). Not bad, but stick with the Royal Albert Hall DVD if you want live later-day Who. The best thing about this DVD is the John Entwistle art-gallery with great drawings of the band, plus his buddies such as Ron Wood, Eric Clapton and Bill Wyman.

The fiery emotions that drove Rumors to be the 3rd best seller of all time was still there - and yet the long overdue healing had begun... I saw FM in Portland and it was a fine show. I so wished they'd all be there but 80% of FM is better than none...

That said, I have to say the DVD of the Boston performance is not quite what I'd hoped for. They should have done SMILE AT YOU and THROWN DOWN from the new CD. And it would have been nice to hear STORMS. For me I thought BEAUTIFUL CHILD and LANDSLIDE where Stevie finally, FINALLY told the whole story about the origins of the song, etc., was wonderful.

In the on going evolution that is FM it is well worth having the DVD...

For someone who remembers listening to Rumors that fateful Summer so long ago... And all the attendent memories in conjures... Well, as she says in Landslide... ""I'm getting older too"" It will never be the same folks... But there are still moments, where they share a look, where Stevie's eyes flare with anger...

Townshend is on fire here, and Roger Daltrey does a very good job (despite singing virtually blind, so to speak, as he was unable to hear himself in the stage monitors), and talk about a great song selection. My faves are 5:15, Love Reign O'er Me, the revised version of The Kids Are Alright, and the mini-Tommy numbers, but overall a fine showing all-around from a band that chose to keep going in the face of tragedy and in the process re-invented and re-invigorated itself. And Ringo may have been a good drummer, but Zak Starkey is a great one. The interviews with Pete and Roger are brief but fascinating, and the subtitles are nice for lyric referencing.

The problem I have with it is not only the editing that others have mentioned, but the lack of 2 happy faces (Stevie and Lindsey) on stage.  They know they are being filmed for a  big concert release package that will be purchased by many of their fans, yet the performances are so lackluster.  Very few smiles, low enthusiasm, and hardly any audience give and take.

His background vocals are missed as well, especially on ""Another Tricky Day"". Pete's voice was a little weak on that one.  I could hardly hear any bass in any of the songs.  It's almost as if they don't have a bass player.  Roger as usual was awesome. The guy never ages!  And, his voice keeps getting better!

The repetition is painful, especially watching Stevie do her silly hand motions during EVERY chorus of Say You Will or Lindsay's song Come, which grinds what little energy there is to a halt. Fleetwood Mac has such a wealth of material to draw from, it's a shame that they stuck with the same songs they've been doing for 30 years, with virtually no variation. They could have challenged themselves by letting Stevie sing You Make Loving Fun or bringing back old treasures like Sara or Blue Letter, but instead they merely repeat their performance from the Dance.

2060253,4,B00023P4B0,"Pete is in good lead guitar form, Roger is in very good voice. This well-filmed, fairly well-recorded show suffers chiefly from the fact that the band play certain over-tired, musically weak hits every time out, and repeat them in this show. (Please, no more My Generation or Can't Explain, ever. Eminence Front is their worst ""hit"" and one of the worst songs on the underrated ""It's Hard album, which offers several much better songs, including two of Entwistle's best, one of which they could have played as a tribute.) I wish they'd dig deeper into their catalog for the many great songs rarely or never played live. ""Relay"" was the one exception played in this show.

No other big complaints, aside from the unavoidable fact that Zak is no Keith and Pino is no John, and that the drums are a bit soft/muddy, and the bass too far back in mix. Finally, what does Rabbit Bundrick add to the proceedings, other than useless organ backdrops and a lame, tacky vibrato on the synth in ""Bargain?"" Hell, just have Simon play the piano part to ""Baba,"" and put Rabbit out to pasture.",1095206400,2,1076,4.633507853403142
2060254,4,B00023P4B0,"It is a good DVD set. The absense of Christine McVie is compensated by more energetic performance of the rest of the band, presenting the material with more ""rockier"" approach.

Lindsey guitar playing is just amazing - outstanding performance! John's bass as solid as ever, while Mick's drumming is pure fun - especially his solo with ""drum vest"". Stevie Nicks is in good form and her voice is still clear and powerful. Four original members of this line-up (there was Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, remember?) are backed up by several good background musicians and for almost three hours present old classics and some songs from their new album ""Say You Will"".

Though I already have their ""Dance"" DVD (which is great, BTW), this concert is also definitely worth watching. More than this, it's a must-have for any Mac fan (and for any lover of good rock also!).  Don't hesitate - go and get it!",1095120000,3,893,4.785714285714286

Unless of course watching Lindsey just GO CRAZY on his guitar, John and Mic kick ass, and Stevie do her thing (yes, she's ""getting older too"") isn't for you, then skip it.",1094688000,10,452,4.54320987654321
2060265,5,B00023P4B0,"I have to say that I liked this DVD. The only bad thing is the fact that Stevie Nicks did not steal the show like she did in the Dance.  I have to say that because like most people relize, Stevie is the biggest star in the band.  This was one of Lindsay Buckinham's best porformances.  I never seen him get so into a show before.

I have to agree with a lot of the reviews with the fact that they should not have played so many of the same songs as they did on the Dance.  That is why I like Stevie's solo performances.  She always swiches her sets around with hits like Edge of Seventeen, Stop Draggin My Heart Around, Talk to Me, and many others. Fleetwood Mac has a lot of other songs they could have played like Sara, Seven Wonders, and Monday Morning to name a few.

Stand Back, if I had to pick a favirot, would be it. They are playing the song like Stevie dose in her concerts - with so much energy.

Rhiannon was a whole lot different then the Dance.  The ending is one of the best I have ever heard in a long time. Say You Will and Goodbye Baby were nice to hear to bad they were the only two new songs she played off the new album!

Don't Stop and World Turing were both great only because Stevie replaced Christen McVie in vocals. And I have got to say who ever it was who sayed she was missed on keyboards needs to be slaped in the face!! I don't understand were your mind is.

Some of Lindsay Buckingham's songs were pretty good I loved the harmony between him and Stevie on Second Hand New. Eyes of the World, Come,  and Peacekeeper were good as well.

Some songs like The Chain, Dreams, Go Your Own Way, Gypsy, and Lanslide were the same thing as in the Dance. Hopefully you will find my review helpfull.",1094515200,9,1719,4.110778443113772
2060266,3,B00023P4B0,"I was greatly anticipating the release of what seemed to me like the ultimate Fleetwood Mac DVD. Having jumped on the bandwagon too late to see any of the live shows from the most recent tour, I had hoped that this DVD would fill the void until the next tour, should there be one.

Having loved the 'Say You Will' album, I was expecting this DVD to be better still than 'The Dance', especially as I had never been the biggest fan of Christine McVie's input other than 'Everywhere' and 'Little Lies', and was looking forward to seeing Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham get more time to perform more numbers.

I was, however, to be severely disappointed. This DVD is far from perfect and overall only falls into the 'average' category. There is so much to criticise here.... firstly, the technical aspects... the sound is particularly muffled. For whatever reason, the dolby 5.1 option is a waste of time because it makes the whole thing virtually unlistenable, and shrouds everything in heavy bass, drowning out nigh on all else.

Also, considering that this is a modern recording and I think itis on digital cameras (although I'm not certain) the picture is quite grainy and some shots are even a little blurry.

The performances are equally as patchy. I can only hope that this was an 'off' couple of nights, because if it wasn't, I'm glad I missed the chance to pay to see the live shows. Lindsey's vocals throughout are at best just passable, at times tuneless and off key, and at worst nearing awful. In fairness he redeems himself on 'Big Love' and 'I'm So Afraid'. 'Peacekeeper' is also not so bad. Everything else you have seen or heard him sing a lot better. Conversely, his guitar work is superb throughout, absoloutely amazing at times!

Stevie doesn't get away without criticism either. Some of her vocals are very very low key on this disc. I appreciate that she is getting older, but some of the vocals are pretty awful here. 'Rhiannon' fails to sparkle, as does 'Dreams' and 'Gold-Dust Woman'. Why people are raving here about her performance of 'Stand Back' is a mystery to me, because it kills the song to me. She is practically barking the lines towards the end, hoping that speed and intensity will gloss over the below par vocals. 'Gypsy', however remained a pleasant experience, and still gave me goose-bumps. 'Beautiful Child' was excellent, and this might be the best ever performance I have ever seen Stevie do of 'Landslide', also 'Say You Will' and 'Say Goodbye' were pretty good. 'Silver Springs' was passable, although, to me the vocal power that made it such a powerhouse performance on 'The Dance' is missing here. Also, I know it isn't that big of a deal, but the twirling in this show sucked. I wish that if she wasn't really able to do it properly, that she hadn't bothered at all.

Also, I actually missed Christine here, because it might have meant a few more songs and less cringeworthy moments of pure ego and indulgence, like the Mick Fleetwood 'Oooh he's drumming his chest! AGAIN!(Yawn)' half hour... at least it felt that long. I assure you I shall never re-watch that segment!

Aside from that, Mick and John were great, as always.

So overall, a so-so performance from the mac. I just hope that it was a blip and not what we should come to expect.",1093824000,6,3291,4.671848013816926
2060267,4,B00023P4B0,"If you're in concert withdrawal or if you just missed Fleetwood Mac's Say You Will Tour (2003-04), then Live in Boston is definitely what you need.

Taped over two nights in Boston (you'll notice different crowds: 1) a sitting front row (?!?) and 2) fans all up against the stage rocking out) this DVD is really a highlight for fans.  I'm glad to say the latter is actually what happens at the shows.  Why? Because even though the media likes to continuously point out that the youngest member of the main band is 53 (when filmed in 2003), they clearly still put on an amazing show.

The whole show features 24 songs, the bulk of which runs like a greatest hits compilation but what kind of Fleetwood Mac show would be complete without the older hits?  It also features six songs from the 2003 studio album ""Say You Will"" -- and an awesome version of lead singer Stevie Nicks' ""Stand Back"". It's really difficult to pick a favourite part of the show--it really is almost 2 hours of continuous music.

As for the DVD in itself, I thought it contained a few too many unneccessarily close close-ups of the beautiful Stevie Nicks during a few of the songs.  Otherwise, you get a great view without someone standing in your way, or binoculars in your hands.  I've heard of problems with playing this in a Sony Playstation--apparently if you leave the DVD running (at the end) it freezes up; something to that effect.  They appear to be isolated incidents however, and play very well on computers and regular DVD players.

If you're a Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks/Lindsey Buckingham fan, this is definitely a must-have.  Right up there with ""The Dance"".",1093737600,4,1645,4.677083333333333
2060268,5,B00023P4B0,"In the words of Kate Bush - ""Wow!"". I was lucky enough to attend one of the Mac's concerts when they were down in Australia this year and am over the moon that this nigh on re-creates that fantastic night for me.

The clarity and sound on this DVD are exceptional and they capture Fleetwood Mac, live and raw like never before. I have looked back at my other Mac concerts (from Mirage, Tango & The Dance) and the energy of 'Live in Boston' is double any of these previous concerts. The star of the show is Lindsey Buckingham, who breathes new life into many of his older songs (Eyes of the World, Second Hand News) but also displays blistering rage on guitar that would put most of his younger counterparts to shame, especially on Come. However his best performance is on the spare, lovely ballad Say Goodbye, as he finally lays to rest the remnants of his love affair with Stevie Nicks. As for the delightful Ms Nicks, while she is overshadowed slightly by Buckingham, she nevertheless produces her own highlights on the rarely performed Beautiful Child, the now concert-staple Silver Springs and particularly on a rocking version of her solo hit, Stand Back, where her voice is as strong as ever and by the middle of it, she is whirling like a dervish. And of the great rhythm section that lend their name to this band, Mick Fleetwood is as mad as ever and goes completely bonkers on World Turning while John McVie stands in the shadows, dependable as ever on bass but still thrilling with his ""monsters are coming"" bass line from The Chain.

This is a must-own DVD for both Mac fans and music fans - a truly stellar concert that long lives on my DVD player.",1093564800,7,1660,4.511627906976744

I mean, I personally like the fact it's a filmed performance of my fave tour last year as it allows me to re-live the show over and over. Also, it's cool to see versions without Christine just for the fact it's different. Besides, I imagine, the majority of people who purchase it would be disappointed if songs like, ""Landslide,"" ""Rhiannon."" ""Dreams,"" etc. were not included. I would, as I never tire of the vintage hits. Besides the DVD contains perhaps the best filmed live version of ""Stand Back,"" )Stevie's smash solo song) with intensity, great vocals and tons of rapid twirls!!!!"" Not only that, but we get ""Never going back again,"" ""Eyes of the world,"" ""second hand news,"" ""Beautiful child."" Plus new tunes such as ""Say you will,"" ""Peacekeeper,"" ""What's the world coming to."" ""Say goodbye,"" ""Goodbye baby,"" and ""Come.""

Hey, that's a LOT of songs normally not presented on a Mac DVD/Vhs concert(Sans ""Eyes', as it was on the ""Mirage"" concert video). I don't think this is the same ole' set-list. Of course the Mac is gonna play ""The chain,"" ""Dreams,""""Landslide,"" ""Go your own way"" etc etc. It's fun to hear the huge hits. But this time, we not only got some cool vintage stuff we don't usually get, we also have six new tunes, and something Stevie never has played until this tour, ""Beautiful child.""And to top it off, it's filmed in wide-screen!!!I think this is an excellent release! It's the Mac peaking once again, and proving they are not a nostalgia band and still have fresh and new things to say. Lindsey's guitar performances are as slick and blistering as ever. And, wow, Stevie Nicks is still a sexy lady at 56! And what a cool voice! She's still the reigning queen of Rock and a total icon!",1092355200,11,2042,4.688022284122563
2060271,4,B00023P4B0,"Being a longtime member of the online Fleetwood Mac fan community, I have come in contact with some of the fans who were in the audience for this performance. The audience was only about 1,000 if that, but they sounded like a full arena. And, seeing two stops on the tour, I can tell you that Fleetwood Mac definitely turns up the intensity when they're performing for a potentially huge audience.

 Making a song-by-song comparison of the songs on The Dance or any prior videos to Live in Boston would take much too long, so I'll just throw in some highlights.

 ""The Chain"" was better on the Mirage concert video and it was better on The Dance video. There was practically no communication at all between Stevie and Lindsey. In The Dance, Stevie's glaring at Lindsey during this song. In the Mirage video, they're both glaring at each other.

 ""Rhiannon"" has become very tame in concert lately, but Stevie seemed to display more intensity for this version than she did on The Dance. However, it still pales in comparison to her earlier days when she was a dervish on stage for this song. There's just a different kind of intensity now, more of the smouldering variety.

 ""Gold Dust Woman"" was at its very peak on The Dance, so there was no topping that here. The Tango In The Night video was also not nearly as good as The Dance version. ""Gypsy"" just loses too much live. The Dance version was marginally better than this one or the Mirage video version because it was recorded live in a studio.

 ""Eyes Of The World"" was better on the Mirage video because Christine was there, but you can tell it's a fun song for the band and Stevie is having a blast with that song. It was interesting to hear Stevie sing Christine's parts on ""Don't Stop"" but I've wanted Stevie to play a larger role in that song anyway.

 One of the few songs that was dramatically better on this video than on any previous video was ""Stand Back."" Stevie has not performed that song with as much energy as she has displayed on that video in over 20 years. The Live in Boston version of that song easily beats the Tango In The Night version or the Live at Red Rocks solo version. No question.

 As for the CD, it's ridiculous that they only included 10 songs and they picked mostly the ones that every Fleetwood Mac fan already had many times over. The only songs I was really excited to get on the CD were ""Stand Back"" and ""Eyes Of The World."" Not only that, but the editors spliced in Christine's vocals in some songs and replaced the end solo in ""Go Your Own Way"" with the version from The Dance CD.

 ""Stand Back"" and ""Eyes Of The World"" give this CD the four star rating.",1091750400,14,2648,4.417695473251029
2060272,4,B00023P4B0,"Unfortunately, it is impossible to review this set without comparing it to The Dance (TD). TD was not only FM's magnum opus, it was a show that set a new standard for concert videos. What keeps me from rendering 5 stars is not the performance or the quality of the sound or picture, it's the choice of material. There are 24 songs in this set. Twelve songs are duplicated from TD. Of the remaining 12 songs, 5 are other FM songs not on TD, 1 is a Stevie solo (Stand Back), and 6 are from their new Say You Will (SYW) CD. My disappointments are: 1) Why duplicate half of the material on TD? FM has a vast body of work to draw from, and none of these versions trump the ones on TD; 2) Why a song from Stevie's solo career? Why not Sara, Sisters of the Moon, or Seven Wonders?; 3) Only 6 songs from SYW? There are 18 songs on SYW! I expected them to draw more from it since this version of FM is w/o Christine McVie. But having said that, watching this group of musicians at the height of their powers is always rewarding. Stevie and Lindsey are a bit more energenic here and even old Mick gets a turn to show off his unique percussion abilities.

But if you already have The Dance and were hoping this would rival that concert, I believe you will be disappointed. Although good, the band, at least the two most prominent members Stevi and Lindsey, seem a bit disinterested and somewhat haggard (again, as compared to The Dance). Lindsey's timing seems a bit off in some songs and his vocals not as intense. Christine McVie is absent and although I regard much of her music as melodic bubblegum, she certainly has a few tunes that would have added to this concert. Of course this is also in a stadium or arena type setting so the sound quality is also not as good. All in all I would rate this higher than say The Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" but in light of the stellar performance of ""The Dance"" and the fact that they cover many of the same songs I would only recommend this to the biggest of Mac fans, i.e. if you find yourself in an either/or decision it's no contest.

There is so much energy and emotion in these songs it's amazing!  Second Hand News, a good song but one I never cared for too much, is now one of my favorites.  Lindsey starts playing and singing the beginning and then the spotlights hit Stevie and the sing out this great song together.  During Tusk they hug and you can see all the bad feelings are gone; they have a look of pure contentment!  But that's not all the great songs, far from it!  Stand Back is performed perfectly in this DVD.  By far my favorite version of the song so far.  The new ending to Rhiannon is perfect for the song.  It truly captures the feeling and atmosphere of that great, moving song.  It is true that Christine isn't here and the DVD lacks Everywhere, Say You Love Me, Songbird and all her other wonderful songs, but the rest of the group does there songs without a hitch.  Eyes of the World is a song I've never heard before live and I have to say it's so fun to listen to.  The only thing I don't like about this DVD is that I heard the live concert lasted three hours and this is only two.  If you even somewhat enjoyed any of the pervious DVDs (The Dance, Tango in the Night etc.) then you'll love this one!  It's Great!",1089331200,5,1341,4.088122605363985
2060278,4,B00023P4B0,"As well he should, for he is the true creative force in the band and is, for me, the only reason to like Fleetwood Mac. When I first saw The Dance back in 1997 I was completely mesmerized. Not by the blonde in the chiffon gown, but by the curly-haired man in the black suit. He had this certain thing to him, a combination of relentless energy, sex, and immeasurable talent.
However, after having the priveledge of attending three of the shows on the Say You Will Tour and seeing this DVD, I no longer find The Dance even really worth watching. There just seems to be something missing. Watching it now the band seems almost sedate in comparison.
A previous reviewer described Christine McVie as the ""glue"" that held the band together and talked about Lindsey Buckingham's ""off-putting weirdness"" as if it's a bad thing. Personally, I don't miss Christine at all and Lindsey's weirdness is what makes him great. The absence of Christine McVie in both the Say You Will album and the tour has allowed the sound of Fleetwood Mac to change. It has allowed them to drift from their status as a pop band and slowly begin to ease into that label called Rock. This is a very good thing.
Stand out performances include the always wonderful ""I'm So Afraid"" and the truly orgasmic experience of ""Come"" (where Lindsey's weirdness- read greatness- really shines through). As for Stevie's offerings, ""Gold Dust Woman"" and ""Beautiful Child"" were wonderful.
Complaints about the DVD and the show in general: not enough Lindsey footage (there can never be enough), Stevie's obnoxious hand gestures during ""Say You Will"" (I can't decide if she's going for ""I'm a Little Teapot"" or if she's trying to rope somebody in the audience), too much footage of percussionist Taku Hirano, and the inclusion of Mick's ego-stroking drum and vest solo during ""World Turning"" (thank goodness for the fast forward button).
When it comes down to it, this DVD captures only a tiny fraction of the magic that is a Fleetwood Mac show, which is the reason why it receives only four out of five stars. However, it allows those fans who were not able to attend a concert to gain some idea of what the experience was like, and allows those who have had the priveledge of seeing the show to relive that experience to some degree.",1089331200,7,2287,4.691542288557214
2060279,4,B00023P4B0,"This DVD, although lacks the glue of the band - Christine, is a solid performance from one of the world's greatest rock groups.  Yes, it's true, Stevie's voice has dropped even more (hell, she IS 56 years old!) but who cares - she STILL IS the Queen of Rock.  The DVD contains a lot of great songs, but it would have been great to have Christine back with ""You Make Loving Fun"" and ""Say You Love Me"" - and who could forget ""Songbird""!  But overall, the DVD is fantastic.
As in ""The Dance"" you have better vocals, but not as good performance.  Stevie really shines in this one because she twirls more and dances (just watch ""Stand Back"" and ""Tusk"")  Lindsey and Stevie seemed to be very happy these days singing with each other-regardless of what others, ahem, say :).  It would have been great to see ""Sara"" and ""Storms"" added to the list, but eh, maybe one day, right!  The strongest 'Stevie' performances are ""Stand Back,"" ""Landslide (WOW!),"" ""Gypsy (she even throws in the ancient ""...I still see your bright eyes...""), and ""Goodbye Baby"".  Lindsey's bests are ""Go Your Own Way"" and ""Tusk"".
Yes, yes, yes, Christine is truly missed and the entire ""Say You Will"" album IS NOTHING MORE than a Stevie and Lindsey solo albums entwined.  But Stevie, Lindsey, John, and Mick (along with their team of backup performers, Sharon and Jana) do a TERRIFIC job at keeping the Mac alive.

2060282,3,B00023P4B0,"I am a diehard Fleetwood Mac fan who attended five concerts in Australia and watched this DVD three times over 96 hours. Despite my fanatical tendencies, I can still be critically objective about Fleetwood Mac.
I am ambivalent about this DVD at best. One the one hand, it is great to have a DVD recording from the current tour. It allows you to relive the concert and to reconnect with idiosyncracies such as the boxing sequence in 'Tusk', to Stevie's 'Say You Will' dance, and Mick's drum solo. There are beautiful moments captured from the acoustic delicacies of 'Say Goodbye' to the epic 'I'm So Afraid' or the spellbinding 'Gold Dust Woman'. Musically speaking - whether you attended a concert or not - you will enjoy the music. Not only is the music superb but the performances are great. Some fans will miss Christine but they should also look at it as an opportunity for the band to head in a different creative direction - and therefore offer us something different as well.
Lindsey is the most active member of the band in this concert. You really get the sense that it's his moment to take center stage. The dialogue between Stevie and Lindsey (whether staged or not) really comes through. The sound and lighting is stunning.
The problem remains in the visual presentation of the concert. I found it alienating and and lacking in emotion. For starters, the editing is too rapid. This makes the concert's pace very snappy. That pace is fine for faster songs but Fleetwood Mac songs are often hypnotic and packed with emotional fibre - that a camera shot would be better to sit and pause for a while to capture that emotion. The film does not know when to be still. Compare any song to 'Silver Springs' from 'The Dance' DVD and look at how the camera sits on Stevie for a while before cutting away to a different band member. In short, the editing is not always appropriate and doesn't allow the audience to engage with the emotion as much as it could.
Secondly, there are too many long shots which creates further alienation between the band and the viewer. Again, this is an editing issue. The idea of a film concert is to bring the viewer closer to the band. It is awful to have Stevie sing a slow song only to cut to a long shot from the back of the Fleet Center. Nicks' fans will hate the fact that you hardly see close-ups of Stevie's face. That may have been a conscious choice on her part but that adds to the alienation as well.
Therein lies my ambivalence: I cherished the DVD because the music is superb but I was disappointed by the visual presentation. I don't mind rapid editing but I think it should be appropriate for the song. Hopefully one day, it will be re-edited. In the meantime, I'll listen to the DVD rather than watch it. That said, it's still a worthwhile purchase.",1088899200,93,2799,4.533596837944664
2060283,5,B00023P4B0,"I have not seen this Dvd yet but I was in the front row in Concord,Ca. The show rocked. When Stevie sang Beautiful Child She dedicated it to Vanessa Carlton. And Lindsay dedicated a song to his Brother Fred for getting him started in music. Mick and John were terrific. Especially on World Turning. Rhiannon was awesome and Stevie rocked on Stand Back. Lindsay is so awesome on guitar he let the audience play it. And after world turning Stevie Came over and took My nephews Headband from me that he made, And she shook my hand. she made my night. The Mac is Back!!!",1088640000,3,566,4.4
2060284,5,B00023P4B0,"I saw the ""Say You Will"" tour twice in Los Angeles, and this excellent 2-DVD set(plus extra audio cd) is an AWESOME way to re-live this tour over and over.
Comparing it to ""The Dance"", is difficult.
While ""The Dance"" is amazing, it was shot over a couple of days before a private audience on a sound stage in Burbank, Ca. The best performances were picked and edited into one show. But this, is a complete 2 hour and 25 minute concert, shot in front of an audience of over 15,000 in Boston. The result is a hard rocking, terrific performance, shot in HD wide screen, with amazing audio and filmed beautifully. The MAC does not hold back,either! Stevie Nicks sounds great, looks beautiful, and twirls like a maniac during her solo song, ""Stand Back."" Mick's drumming is fast, furious, and kicks the show into high gear on the third song, ""Eyes of the world."" He could put a drummer 30 years younger to shame. And his trademark solo during ""World Turning"", is still crazy and entertaining, like a demented cheerleader gone psychedelic. Lindsey Buckingham's vocals sound sharper than they have in recent years, and his guitar playing is just amazing. And, let's not forget John McVie, keeping perfect bass with Mick's manic drumming! Without Christine Mcvie this time, the show is edgier, harder rocking, and although she is missed, I kind of like this version of the band for a change. Stevie's ""Rhiannon"" sounds fresh and edgy. Rare songs such as ""Beautiful child"" and new ones like ""Peacekeeper"" and ""Say you will"" rock! I cannot praise this DVD enough! It is nothing short of perfect in my eyes! I will watch this over and over and cherish it! The bonus audio CD included is a very cut down selection of songs from the DVD. Nice to pop into the car stereo with the sound turned way up! This DVD set is a very welcomed addition to my vast Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks video library.",1088640000,4,1880,4.631736526946108
2060285,3,B00023P4B0,"I saw Fleetwood Mac on this tour 3 times and let me tell you - while most bands don't live up to the quality of their past, Fleetwood Mac is like fine wine: getting better ALL the time. This DVD is a great example of their 2003-2004 Say You Will World Tour. It showcases all of their great hits and treats you to a few special moments. The sound of the band is great, the DVD sound quality is superb, the picture is crystal clear. My personal highlight is ""Stand Back"" because Stevie becomes ""solo Stevie"" with her trademark dancing and spins that she only does on her solo tours. Absolutely awesome. At 54 she's still the queen of rock. If you're a Fleetwood Mac fan or not, BUY THIS DVD.",1087862400,10,689,4.267175572519084
2060286,4,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac performed live on the Today show out in the street last fall when this tour started. They didn't sound good, they didn't look good, Christine was sorely missing, even the backup singers didn't sound good. I generally buy a new concert DVD almost every week for the past two years if there is anything remotely good, I now have over 120 concerts, all classic rock. Last week I knew this was coming out, Fleetwood Mac is one of my favorites, so I thought, let's give it a try. I went to Suncoast Video in the Mall because I didn't want to wait, it cost the full $32.99 but they had 6 in stock, Best Buy didn't even list ""Live in Boston"" on their website. I emailed them and asked if they thought Fleetwood Mac had fallen so far that they didn't need to stock it. Best Buy replied that they were not stocking it at this time, I guess their concert DVD buyer must be a 20 year old kid. Anyway, get the DVD, it's a double DVD plus a 10 song live CD, so that's why it's so expensive. Yes, there are times that you wish Christine McVie was there, but overall the performance, the sound, the audience and the video clarity are all excellent, it's well worth having and you'll rewatch it just as much as ""The Dance"". Without Christine they managed to slip in a Stevie song, ""Stand Back"", which is one of the highlights. BUY IT NOW, but don't waste your time going to Best Buy.",1087776000,2,1381,4.2748091603053435
2060287,3,B00023P4B0,"well... i took the weekend to watch the long-awaited concert dvd ""live from boston"" from the big mac... my overall impression: although there are a few good performances on here, i wasn't all that impressed... first of all, what's with no dvd extras????... i was hoping for some interviews or music videos or SOMETHING... but we didn't get a thing with this package... and with the concert taking up TWO dvd's, you'd figure they'd either put everything on one disc or pack two discs full of bonus material... yes you get a cd in the package, but it didn't cover even half of the audio on the dvd's... overall, just refering to what i paid for it and what i got, i left really jipped...
the concert perfomances themselves were okay... yes, it did containt some songs that weren't on ""the dance"" dvd (""stand back"" and ""say you will"" i really like alot), but ""live in boston"" really seemed like a rehash of ""the dance"" dvd... ""tusk"" was missing the energy of a marching band... ""come"" and ""im so afraid"" are too long and too over-the-top...
i saw the mac when they came to chicago early on in the tour last year... at that show (and at other shows i've read about on nicksfix.com), the band actually showed their more spontaneous sides by chatting and making jokes with the audience... i personally like to see that side of artists when they're on stage... you didn't get much of a feel for that here...
i love the mac, but i have to say, this dvd could have been something really great... instead, it's run-of-the-mill... sorry guys...",1087776000,3,1533,4.578181818181818
2060288,3,B00023P4B0,"I Think sometimes people forget when writing a review, that people want to know the actual quality of the disc. Not just the performance. I have been anticipating this concert since the tour started. When I found out that it was to be recorded in Hi-Definition I was thrilled. When it was released however, I found myself disappointed. When a show is filmed in widescreen, it ultimately is meant to be viewed on a widescreen TV. I happen to have a very expensive 65"" widescreen Sony. Filming in Hi-Def is a waste of time when you don't bother to format the Disc to Anamorphic. By the time the image is zoomed to fit the screen, the quality of the recording is compromised. Not to mention, the stage shots are soft to begin with! If I was watching a football game in Hi-Def...and it was only sharp in the closeups, I'd be more than a little annoyed. I paid $28 for a show that had the potential to be 3 times as good as it was. People, don't be so fast to praise because you're a fan. Review the actual quality of the DISC. As for the content, well, like others have said, it's all Mac! The show is good if you're a fan. But if you try to watch it with a large widescreen system, it becomes difficult to get 'lost in the show' for all the DVD's shortcomings.",1087776000,5,1257,4.2635983263598325
2060289,4,B00023P4B0,"Fleetwood Mac performs two-dozen songs with spectacular energy and drive.  Christine McVie's absence is noticeable, but the band still has it together.  Although Stevie Nicks voice is a few octaves lower and she doesn't spin around the stage as much, she still has confidence in her abilities.  Mick Fleetwood is a crazy man, as ever, never missing a beat and throwing himself into his percussion with open mouth fervor.  John McVie has never been a showcase performer, but his bass guitar runs perfectly with Fleetwood's drumming.  However, the show really belongs to Buckingham, who loves the spotlight and does things with his guitar that can be startling.  Literally, grabbing at his strings with both hands in a seemingly random manner, he livens up the show whenever he solos.  The performance is top notch and feels better than ""The Dance"" which was somewhat more cold and calculated.  The light show surpasses ""The Dance"" as well with variations and enhancements not seen before.  The only complaint I have is that this wasn't released in DTS as well.  The sound is that good.",1087776000,5,1084,4.972222222222222
2060290,5,B00023P4B0,"I purchased this DVD the day it came out! It was worth the $30! In my opinion it's even better than ""The Dance"" video (which was also a GREAT buy!!)! It's like being at the concert again...and I've already gone twice! Now I can see it over and over again! There is so much energy from the band members on this DVD! I would say the highlights are ""Say You Will"", ""Rhiannon"" (which surprised me...it was almost as spectacular as it was in the 70's!), a rocking version of ""Come"", ""Landslide"", the lovely ""Beautiful Child"", ""Tusk"", and definately ""Stand Back""!!! The sound quality is awesome! Don't miss this one!",1087689600,,610,4.605504587155964
2060291,5,B00023P4B0,"FLEETWOOD MAC ROCKS THE ROOF OFF! Short of a decade later, Four Fifths of the superstar ""fab-five"" MIGHTY MAC RUMOURS era remain happily reunited and youthfully enthusiastic exactly thirty years after joining forces to become OUR beloved FM, circa 2004. Namesakes Mick Fleetwood and John McVie maintain their savagely hypnotic hard driving rhythmic pulse and propelling forces of the band, almost 40 years on! The ""diamond"" in the band's crown, Christine McVie, has flown solo(new album is due in 2004!), but, FM have reinvented, reenergized themselves successfully as a powerhouse rock band and carried on. Stevie Nicks, remains the ""pearl"" and one of the band's vocal and visual staples. The ""ruby"", and most brilliant gem in the band's crown has always been LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM, and on this LIVE IN BOSTON Dvd, he shines onstage brighter than all the band's parts as a sum. FLEETWOOD MAC embrace their star musician, guitarist god, arranger, producer and pay tribute to his immense talents and contributions throughout the ongoing 2003-04(possibly beyond?) SAY YOU WILL Tour. LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM takes charge onstage with all his boundless cosmic energy and dramatic vocal abilities. He explodes with 'gusto' all over the stage playing his frenzied guitar solos, one sweat drenched impassioned performance after another, like a bronkin' buck bursting with the mighty spunk of a teenager whipping the audience into maddening enthusiasm throughout the show. LINDSEY BUCKINGHAM is FM's star entertainer and he comes on like a hurricane throught this LIVE IN BOSTON show! Hard to believe FLEETWOOD MAC have been around since 1967, with all this energy onstage! If FLEETWOOD MAC ever does a ""Farewell Tour"" that drags on in CHER-like proportions, CHRISTINE better jump back onboard or maybe even tour as the ""opening act"" - a ""Farewell Tour"" without Christine is NOT a true goodbye. Note: Lindsey & Stevie perform ""DON'T STOP"" quite well as the ""encore"" here.",1087603200,2,1955,5.269230769230769
2060292,5,B00023P4B0,"Lindsey's hair is grey, Stevie looks like she's lost some weight since ""The Dance"" (looking good)but her range of voice isn't nearly where it used to be. And we're missing Christine McVie.
All of this might give you the impression that this is going to be just another live album by a burned out band...NOT! Mick's perfect drumming, and Lindsey's powerful guitar really rocks this show. There's a seriousness to the perfomance here that blows away the Dance concert. This live album set just goes to show what a real great band Fleetwood Mac still is after all these years. The best way to feel the power of this concert is by listening to the CD alone without the visuals of the DVD.  Excellent job!",1087603200,2,700,4.6
2060293,5,B00023P4B0,"The first thing I noticed watching Fleetwood Mac ""Live In Boston"" was the superb sound quality. There are additional musicians (two guitarists, a keyboard player, another drummer and several female backup singers) alongside Stevie, Lindsey, Mick & John. The additional musicians are top notch and this is one reason for the outstanding sound. Whether this dvd has been overdubbed is anyones guess. But I can say that the band puts on one hell of a show - no mistake about that. They run thru their classics such as ""The Chain"", ""Dreams"", ""Rhiannon"", ""Go Your Own Way"", ""Tusk"", ""Gold Dust Woman"", ""Silver Springs"" and ""Don't Stop"" to name a few,as well as newer songs such as ""Say You Will"", ""Say Goodbye"", ""Peacekeeper"", ""Eyes Of The World"", ""Come"" and ""What's The World Coming To"". But the big surprise here is Stevie singing ""Stand Back"" (from her solo days as a recording artist) which is full of energy like I've never heard nor seen before. Longtime Fleetwood Mac member Christine Mc Vie's absence is noticeable here and her songs and voice gave the group a certain appeal that is sorely missing. This 2-dvd set also features a cd which includes a collection of songs from the two dvd's such as ""Eyes Of The World"", ""Dreams"", ""Rhiannon"", ""Big Love"", ""Landslide"" and ""Stand Back"" plus  four more. If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan then this is a must have! Highly Recommended!",1087516800,,1377,4.810126582278481

8021481,5,B00023P4B0,"I've been a Fleetwood Mac fan for quite some time. The Rumours album more or less solidified my attraction to the band. Having said that I would be remissed if I don't point out the fact that watching these musicians grow and improve upon their individual talents as professionals was certainly one of the highlights in following them and being called a fan. In my opinion, they, as a whole or individually have been underrated for most of their career. Lindsey Buckingham is one of the finest guitarists you will ever have the pleasure of listening to or if you are lucky witness play live on stage. ""Live in Boston"" is a phenomenal CD/DVD package. You get the best of both worlds-a definite must purchase if you ask me. There are several reasons for this. You get to listen to these great tunes over and over again with the CD. Then you get to watch and witness an incredible show by some extremely talented individuals over and over again with the 2-DVD disc included. Now here comes the kicker...there is one track, both on the CD as well as on the DVD that is worth the cost of this CD/DVD package by its lonesome self. It is titled ""I'm So Afraid"". I have listened to it and watched it more times than I can count. Even after all that, every time I watch Buckingham perform his guitar solo as part of that tune the hair on my arms stand. Saying it is one-of-a-kind, phenomenal, incredible beyond belief doesn't begin to do it justice. I know this following statement I am going to put out there for all to read is going to get some harsh responses. I am willing to live with that. However, before the trashing begins please watch it first and be honest with yourself. OK, here goes...I sincerely feel it is even better than Page's ""Stairway..."" solo. I never had my arm hair stand because of that solo. Anyway, for what it's worth, this is a great CD/DVD package worth including into your collection.
