If at all, the only thing that it mildly accomplishes is provide advertisement for Reg Pridmore's motorcycling school - which by judging from this video leaves a lot to be desired in terms of structure and true hard-core motorcycle coaching.  Lucky for all of us serious sports motorcyclists there are excellent options out there... if you know what I mean !",1272412800,,462,4.987012987012987
8166870,5,B000M7FRUE,"Hello, I recommend this DVD to any serious rider as a complementary to reading Nick Ienatsch's book cover to cover and on sale on Amazon.com. I have a personally signed copy because i went to his school. I just got this DVD today and it is awesome. But, his book is the real thing if you do not want to spend $3000 on the real school. The book by Nick Ienatsch is a repeat read for us all. It may save your life and make your riding so much better. This book is my personal guarantee to you that it will be so much worth more to you than some 20 bucks it sells for here. I met Nick through the Freddie Spencer's school.",1242691200,,619,4.0
8166871,4,B000M7FRUE,"A very engaging introductory video on the sport of motorcycle road racing.  I found it to be informative about the basics of the sport and many of the how's and why's of sportbike design and function and riding skills.  Introductory is the best word for this video, however.  If you want a more detailed or advanced instructional video you will find this one a bit lacking but it's a great way to keep your spirits up on a cold wintry day.",1232841600,,439,4.395061728395062
8166872,5,B000M7FRUE,"I bought this dvd and am exceedingly pleased. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys motorcycles. This video is great for all riding skill levels. The dvd isn't only about racing, but how a motorcycle works and reacts.",1176249600,2,224,4.769230769230769
