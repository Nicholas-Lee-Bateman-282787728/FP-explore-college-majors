8530038,4,B008RCIYRY,"This TV series reminds me of a Shakespearean comedy.  The use of memory loss and disguised identity are standard fare in both Shakespeare and Hallyu dramas.  Fondant Garden is done with flair and charming humor, thanks to the comedic talents of Park Jung Min, who shows that he has more than a fine voice in this TV series.  The memory loss plot is worked with several unique elements concerning the heroine's restaurant 'family' and the rival love interest's family.  Both second leads have their own story, which is not resolved until the final episodes.  Actually, there is no real resolution for them; and this might be a flaw in the plot.  What to do with them at the end?  Just put them together without much explanation or justification, and everyone will be happy.  Since this tv series is fluff anyway, it didn't matter to me.  There was enough comedy and delightful characterization that I didn't mind.  There are no hard-core, irredeemable villains here, just annoying spoiled and persistent love rivals, and a cruel grandmother who finally sort-of comes to her senses.  Beyond that, I'll be writing spoilers, so I won't go any further, other than to say that I did watch this just for Park Jung Min, but enjoyed it much more than I expected to.  Comedic fluff yes, but enough conflict to make it interesting, and very likable characters.  Even the spoiled girl's obnoxious father becomes likable a few scenes in--another skillful development of both comedy and characterization.",1472947200,,1490,4.93574297188755

He should do more TV dramas. This drama has great views, great cast, great story. It is about this rich korean guy who doesnt want to be the succesor to his fathers company and also don't want his marrige to be decided for him so he runs away to taiwan and finds there his true love and true self. I highly recomend it is full of fun youll never regret it.",1350172800,2,518,3.9903846153846154
