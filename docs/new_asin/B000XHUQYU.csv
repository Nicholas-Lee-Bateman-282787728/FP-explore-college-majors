3002475,2,B000XHUQYU,"I feel a warning is necessary to anyone who is even thinking of purchasing this dvd set.  This complete first season has only 6 episodes, yeah that's right, six 1/2 hour episodes.  The makers of this set spread out these 6 episodes onto 3 discs.  They crammed some ""extras"" onto it no doubt to make it look fuller and to justify the price they're charging.  However the extras are nothing more than some bios of the workers, still-frame pictures, and online interviews.  So all in all what you've got is a lot of stuff that could fit onto one disc.  This is pathetic.  This season should not have been sold solo, but combined with season 2 or heck maybe season 3 as well if there are only 6 episodes for those seasons as well. This dvd set was marketed to the suckers like me who bought it without really looking at, but to my defense I've never experienced a 3 disc set with only 6 episodes.  This item is grossly overpriced for the content and not worth it.  So heed my warning and avoid my mistake.",1234483200,44,1001,4.338709677419355

Give me a break!!!  Is this a cooking show?  All you see is this fake, contrived drama occurring between the bakers as if such a thing would actually happen.  ""OH NO, we ran out of icing!!  You were supposed to order it yesterday!!  I forgot because I was watching True Blood and got caught up.  Now we can't make our cup cakes!!  What should we do!!!""

8228283,5,B000XHUQYU,"With only 6 episodes, I was only willing to pay so much for this DVD set.  When the price came around, I purchased it.  I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $8-$10 (at the most) including shipping!  But at that price, seeing the premiere of Duff and his team is worth it.

I suppose I could have done without, but after getting season 2 through 5, I was so curious about the beginning.

This is one of the few reality shows I've ever liked.  They don't get into all kinds of fake drama and such.  It is closer to a documentary I think, but the crew is still super funny and likeable.  When I watch them, I feel like I'm right in the bakery with them!

Now I only wish they would release the rest in Region 1, or the price would come down for the overseas release.

8228284,5,B000XHUQYU,Lots of fun to watch what goes on in his bakery and life. His staff are hilarious and I'll buy more seasons if they have.,1389571200,,121,3.88
8228285,5,B000XHUQYU,The show is great and I couldn't find it on Netflix so I had to buy it :) Came in great condition and got it at a great price.,1378339200,,126,3.3793103448275863
8228286,5,B000XHUQYU,I love this show. I wish it was still on the Food Network. I like this better than Cake Boss,1378252800,2,92,3.65
8228287,1,B000XHUQYU,"Duff is an artist, in his own way, but this show is so poorly written that I couldn't watch it. They focus WAY too much on the lives of the people that work there (who go on and on about not knowing anything about cake), than they do about the process of the cakes they make. If I wanted to watch the drama of a workplace, I'd definitely pick a different. When I want to enjoy watching a show about artistic, and elaborate cakes, I always turn to the Cake Boss.",1371168000,,461,4.076923076923077
