6402658,5,B00K31RCNO,You probably won't like this unless your a fan H. B. Halicki or unless you like car flicks. However; if you are a fan this type of film then this 3 movies in one is the way to go. You cant beat it for the price. The original Gone in 60 seconds held the record for most cars destroyed in a film. You got to see that if for no other reason!,1478476800,2,338,3.7083333333333335

6402660,3,B00K31RCNO,"Bought this to see the other Halicki movies. Already have the original Gone in 60 seconds. For the most part, these three additional movies are essentially Gone in 60 Seconds warmed over, except Junkman which does have new footage. Some amazing stunts in Junkman including a car jumping an aircraft in flight, which I don't think has ever been repeated (live, NOT CGI). They just don't make movies like this any longer. Too many lawyers in Hollywood. Political incorrectness at it's zenith. Many of the bystanders are real citizens that live in the area and are not actors or extras.",1462060800,3,583,4.84
6402661,3,B00K31RCNO,"Pretty fun movies.  I mainly got the DVD because I own a Bricklin and it's fun to watch one in action in 'Deadline Auto Theft"", but the shows are entertaining with lots of nice old cars and wrecks, including Corvettes and even a '70 Javelin, which I also own one of.",1455753600,2,266,4.215686274509804
6402662,5,B00K31RCNO,"I think H.B. was cool for what he did on such a grand scale on such a low budget. Of course, some say it could have done with a bit more polish and known actors but the concept and execution of his ideas were great. I recommend these movies including his super cool ""Gone in 60 Seconds"", a big thank you to his wife for getting his last movie put together in its shortened but great car chase sequence in which he tragically died.",1441670400,2,430,4.130952380952381
6402663,1,B00K31RCNO,Would give it zero stars. Total crap,1440460800,,36,4.285714285714286
6402664,5,B00K31RCNO,"This guy is ""BONKERS""! I have the utmost respect for his filmmaking. Besides the fact, like Steve McQueen, he did his own stunts. He was way before his time.",1439251200,3,157,4.448275862068965
6402665,5,B00K31RCNO,"I've been a big fan of H.B. Halicki since seeing the original Gone In 60 Seconds. I have been looking for these three movies for a long time. So glad they've finally been released on this DVD compilation. If you're a fan of vintage movies with killer car chase scenes, these films are for you.",1421193600,3,293,4.345454545454546

8655617,5,B00K31RCNO,"This deserves every star!!!  If you loved the original "" Gone in 60 Seconds"" you will definitely enjoy "" The Junkman""!  While looking for "" The Junkman"" I found this three pack that is the cheapest one of all I found available & ironically it has the most extras!!!  "" Gone in 60 Seconds 2"" is a 30 minute car chase & because H.B. "" Toby"" Halicki  tragically died during the making of  it  this independent short film was his last.  But he had purchased over 400 vehicles to deliberately crash putting this short film in the Guinness book of world records & makes it worth adding to your movie collection!  "" Deadline Auto Theft"" is a bizarre amalgamation of "" Gone in 60 seconds "" & "" The Junkman"" fusing the two movies together & adding b roll film from both films with a few added scenes filmed with Hoyt Axton.  I would have been upset paying for a theater ticket to see "" Deadline Auto Theft"" but as a beautifully restored bonus for purchasing the cheapest available version of "" The Junkman"" which is worth every penny I paid!!!  Every film on this D.V.D. is beautifully restored so getting the Guinness world record breaking short film ""Gone in 60 Seconds 2"" that was previously unavailable along with "" Deadline Auto Theft"" & the bonus material makes this hands down the most awesome way to add "" The Junkman"" to my collection!!!  With C.G.I. , political correctness, Insurance insanity I don't think any of these records will ever be broken because They Just Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore!!!  And never will again!!!",1532217600,,1528,4.536496350364963
8655618,3,B00K31RCNO,"Junkman to me is the best one of this collection despite the horrible end to a nice Vette'. Gone in 60 seconds II the unfinished movie which was finished was a bit boring and Gone In 60 seconds,and Deadline Auto Theft was slightly better with the wacky Bricklin .",1530316800,2,263,4.387755102040816
