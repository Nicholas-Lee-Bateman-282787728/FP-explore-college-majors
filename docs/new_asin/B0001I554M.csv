8013135,1,B0001I554M,"Cheap dvd I picked up for Halloween. My kiddos watched the first few minutes and then walked off to go play with their toys. I watched some of the movie, wasn't impressed. Seeing a young ""Juno"" play the role of a young girl who downloads a ghost wasn't as entertaining as I expected it to be.",1417824000,,292,4.232142857142857

8013137,4,B0001I554M,"My son is 5 and loves this movie.  We rented it and he didn't want to take it back so i bought it.  There are costumes and ghosts, but it is not scary.  I think it showed my son that he shouldn't be scared at halloween because there are just people under all those costumes.",1190764800,3,274,3.9454545454545453
8013138,5,B0001I554M,This is a very cute movie.  I decided to rent it at Blockbuster because I have the Movie Pass thing.  The cover of the DVD looked cute and the story reminded me of my middle school years being obsessed with making haunted houses in our neighborhood woods with the neighbors.  The story line is a lot more than you would expect and its very cute.  I would definitely recommend it!,1119571200,6,379,4.371428571428571
