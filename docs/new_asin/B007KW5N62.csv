5094054,5,B007KW5N62,"I have been hoping to see this movie on home video since I saw it on the ""Z"" channel in Los Angeles 30 years ago.  The transfer is excellent, the mono sound is very good and the drama is as I remember.  There are fine performances all around.
And the MUSIC!  This is a haunting score by David Raksin, who gave us ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" among other classics.  The jazz is played by the top studio guys of the era.  The voice given Stella Stevens is also remarkable.
Thanks to the distributors who have given this minor classic a new life.",1360713600,2,542,4.223300970873787

First of all I never understood why John Cassavetes kind of disowned this film. I believe it is excellent. The film is made with a great deal of discipline which Cassavetes ""more personal"" efforts mostly weren't. His skill at directing actors was always wonderful and it is no less true of this film. Everyone in it is at their peak. Some have asserted that Bobby Darin was miscast here but I don't agree at all. The real standout in a grand cast is Stella Stevens. Recently Tim Lucas (of Video Watchdog)opined that Jerry Lewis MUST HAVE SEEN THIS FILM before casting her in his own THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. I never thought of that before but the similarity in the roles template is reason to wonder at the very least. And she is not only one of the most beautiful women to ever exist but QUITE a grand DRAMATIC as well as comic actress.

So many of the other performances (for that matter co-writer Cassavetes had more discipline in the script here than ever)are super. Everett Chambers wonderful lizard like performance turning on dime from smiling glad-hander to back-stabber, Bobby Darin playing a jazz musician (someone whose musical tastes AND OUTPUT was ALWAYS broad in real life)who is basically a self-centered egocentric (MANY would assert not far from his REAL personality)is always convincing and never a caricature. Nick Dennis is always a ball to watch and see (Everyone remembers him in Aldrich's KISS ME DEADLY...""Pretty POW!""). Vincent Edwards (when he was doing almost NOTHING but villains before BEN CASEY too him to stardom) isn't convincing as an IRISH person, but is effective as a drunken bully who beats tiny Darin up and humiliates him in front of his friends/bandmates and girl (Stevens)...In addition the parts of the band are played by real jazz players and they are all extraordinarily effective...as is Lionel Lindon's cinematography and David Raksin's score. SEE IT!",1347753600,5,2151,5.30791788856305
5094056,4,B007KW5N62,"The Raksin theme (aka A SONG AFTER SUNDOWN) is the real highlight of the movie and gets TOO LATE BLUES an extra star.  John Cassavetes directs what's generally regarded as a failure, albeit one with potential and some curiously good moments.  The biggest problem is that the film doesn't concentrate enough on the music, or the beat-generation mentality, that defines it.  It's too mainstream, and there was little freedom to explore, with any detail, the psychosexual connection between a hooker and an impotent musician.  Darin and Stevens are obviously discombobulated by the Cassavetes knack for improvisation, and weak editing only compounds the problem.
The Olive Films' blu-ray looks sterling.",1343174400,10,700,5.394495412844036
5094057,5,B007KW5N62,"This was the second film directed by John Cassavettes, and it suffers from his quirkiness, and terrible editing job. It was originally 4 hours long. Although I'm a fan of JC's anyway. With a character as complex as Ghost, and a back drop of the world of jazz musician's trying to make it, he could've had a classic, gritty film about the subject. He almost does. But what saves it and makes it worth while for me is Bobby  Darin. He lives, breathes, and is Ghost Wakefield. Darin easily shows great emotion with his communicative brown eyes, and his pliable, handsome face. He's a natural, and it's a shame his health robbed him of the opportunity to do more film work. He has a dymanic presence on screen, sizzles with sexual undertones. Darin would only have gotten better and better as he matured.

Why I rate it high is because it belongs in any retrospective of the legendary, uncompromising director, and it gave Bobby Darin one of the most multi-talented entertainers of all time, a chance to shine. I'll be forever grateful to Cassavettes' for casting Bobby in this role.",1341360000,19,1079,4.673684210526316
5094058,4,B007KW5N62,"An uncompromising jazz musician (Bobby Darin) holds firmly to his artistic convictions not to sell out for money and fame. But when he falls in love with a sad and wounded wannabe singer (Stella Stevens), he feels humiliated and ashamed when he can't physically defend her from a drunken thug (Vince Edwards) and he turns against her and his bandmates. After the critical success of his indie film SHADOWS (which won the Critics award at the Venice film festival) in 1959, director John Cassavetes second directorial effort was for a major studio, Paramount. Yet it doesn't have the feel of a slick Hollywood studio movie, it feels improvisatory and spontaneous (Cassavetes co-wrote the script) while retaining an authentic jazz milieu. Only the ending feels like a mainstream Hollywood film but I don't know if it was Cassavetes' idea or a compromise. The acting is excellent with both Darin and Stevens showing great potential that was never fully realized in either's acting career. Stevens, in particular, seems a major actress about to bloom. The nicely rendered B&W photography is by Lionel Lindon (MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) and the minimal underscore by David Raksin (LAURA). Fine supporting work by Everett Chambers as Darin's mean spirited and spiteful agent, Cliff Carnell, Seymour Cassel, Nick Dennis, Rupert Crosse and Marilyn Clark as rich matron who makes Darin her gigolo.

The Olive DVD is a crisp B&W transfer in an anamorphic 1.85 aspect ratio.",1339977600,11,1458,5.151898734177215
8519159,2,B007KW5N62,"I am not a fan of Cassevettes first couple of movies. I am mainly talking about shadows and too late blues.
Too Late Blues feels like it is completely commercial and unfortunately falls into the same complaint category as Shadows. What i mean by this is the leading male actor. In Shadows the lead looks comically just like Lou Reed and he tries to be way too tough making the performance cringe worthy.
Some directors like Roman Polanski just have it from the beginning. Roman Polanski's student films remain some of his best work. For Cassevettes it took some time for him to create his own style and wow did he get it eventually.
This film has the same leading male problem as shadows. The lead is so dull it make character development hard in the sense of the audience caring about the character. This film looks like any other mediocre film from that time period.
Even for historical significance it seems irrelevant.",1522454400,,922,4.662576687116564
8519160,3,B007KW5N62,"I had not seen this film for a long time and was disappointed when I did recently.  Bobby Darin was an outstanding show and saloon performer, but he is simply not for the big screen. He doesn't photograph well for the part and is just not an accomplished actor. Stella Stevens is always stunning, but her character certainly would not be introduced in a Dior or Del La Renta gown. Call this discriminatory, but she is just too glamorous to portray the down on her luck character. Again, both Stevens and Darin seem stymied on their lines, when they have them, and there are not many good ones at that. There is also a lack of character depth which leaves the viewer in an often confused state of ""how did they get there?"" The Greek bar owner was a silly stereotype which may be offensive to many. The best performer was Steven's agent and members of the band. It is a real artistic blunder when secondary characters are more than the stars! I have never liked Casavetes as a director/writer because of his continual dark attitude, but that is OK in some situations. In Too Late Blues the script has an annoying direction when the dialogue is between actors. Often the lines for two could be  better served by being said by one. The viewer often knows exactly what a response will be to a line because the second actor is just a written extension of the first. Again, there is not a clear enough definition of each character to make a difference between lines. Finally, the script is too preachy and moves into ""telling us what to believe"" rather than letting the message naturally emerge. The film batters us with moral messages and that's not art - it's politics but I would never advise not to see the film. What one does not appreciate, another may.

8519162,4,B007KW5N62,"Bobby Daren was a cool actor who had a lot of potential to get even better.  He plays a jazz musician whose group hasn't made it past playing for free in the park and nursing home gigs.  As you would expect with this director some scenes feels like you are there watching them in real life but in a good way.  To me, Stella Stevens was doing a sad Kim Novak doing a sad Marilyn Monroe imitation and I did not get why Bobby's character was so attracted to her.  I love small, dark, jazz movies and this is one of the best.",1390435200,4,521,4.029126213592233
8519163,5,B007KW5N62,"The story shows struggling musicians and their struggle to 'make it' in the world of jazz.
Bobby Darin carries the movie. He was wonderful in his part. He could have become a major star on film as well as in music.
The film is by John Cassavettes. I believe it was his follow up to Shadows.
The movie takes itself very seriously.
Still I'd recommend it.",1387843200,,353,4.363636363636363

8519168,5,B007KW5N62,"Bobby Darin displays his acting genius in this film, and it was his first.  Cassavetes's directing is brilliant, and his first, too.  I had not heard of this film before;  it's a treasure.  Stella Stevens is so good--and so young--it's too bad that she didn't make many more movies.  Vince Edwards has a small role, but also does a fine job, and he, too, was then a novice.  While it is rather dark thematically, it's an artwork worth seeing.  The story will not lift you up, but the sense of appreciation of the acting and directing certainly will.",1363824000,2,549,4.540816326530612
