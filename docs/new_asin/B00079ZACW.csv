2207023,5,B00079ZACW,I am delighted to have this hard-to-find film! It played like a charm! Thanks for the fine service.,1128988800,7,99,4.555555555555555
2207024,3,B00079ZACW,"While Gregory Peck heads the cast, ""The Purple Plain"" is a British World War II film, produced in 1954 by the J. Arthur Rank Studios (and presumably distributed by MGM). So far reviews seem to fall into two camps--people who love it and people who are unimpressed with it. I find myself somewhere between these two extremes. Unlike at least one other reviewer, I will try not to reveal too much of the plot for first-time viewers.

Mr. Peck plays Squadron Leader Bill Forrester, a Canadian pilot and veteran of the Battle of Britain, now assigned to the Asian theatre of the war, specifically Burma, against the Japanese. Having lost his young wife in the London blitz, Forrester feels he has nothing to live for, and flies his Mosquito missions accordingly. He is reckless, even suicidal, much to the chagrin of his navigator as well as the people on the ground.

The kind Dr. Harris (a ""pre-M"" Bernard Lee) tries to help Forrester out of his depression by involving him with some of the local Burmese people, including a lovely young woman, Anna (Win Min Than). Forrester becomes captivated with Anna, and slowly regains his self respect and will to live. His survival instincts are soon put to the test. On the next flight, his plane crashes in very harsh, and Japanese-held, territory. Forrester survives the crash along with his young navigator

(Lyndon Brook), who receives nasty burns, and an older scientist, Blore (Maurice Denham). With limited water, and the blazing Burmese sun, the three men face a harsh fate, with a questionable chance of survival. Can Forrester return to the woman who has rekindled his interest in life, and redeem a tattered reputation with his compatriots ?

Mr. Peck delivers a compelling performance--he remains one of the most watchable actors in movies. I should also mention that fine British character actress, Brenda De Banzie--her role is small, but she leaves an indelible impression as Miss McNabb, the indefatigable Scottish missionary.

The full-screen picture exhibits effective colour--the sound is mono--don't look for extras.

""The Purple Plain"" may not be one of Gregory Peck's most famous films--nor can it be considered one of the classic films of the fifties. At the same time, I found it an absorbing drama, well-acted by Mr. Peck, Ms. Than and a fine British cast--there is action, romance, suspense and important, universal themes are explored. I am pleased to add this DVD to my collection.",1116979200,89,2449,4.9755501222493885
2207025,2,B00079ZACW,"World War II is soon to end. We're in hot and humid Burma where you can count on one hand the number of scenes in which people aren't perspiring or wearing sweaty clothes. This becomes noticeable because the characters and narrative, in their cliched predictability, don't hold your attention. Brenda de Banzie has a lively turn as a Scots missionary, and Gregory Peck is convincing as a daredevil flyer who connects with an educated beauty improbably helping out in a jungle village. There's no doubt whatsoever which men in a plane crash will survive the long trek back to base. You have seen this movie many times before. You might possibly enjoy seeing it again.",1116720000,5,666,4.8
2207026,2,B00079ZACW,"Bought on the strength of other five-star reviews, I expected this film to be extraordinary. It is anything but. I found the story exquisitely dull. Troubled flier finds love in Burma, accidentally crashes plane, walks out of desert, carrying navigator across his shoulders. Deserts in Burma? This looks as if it were filmed in Arizona! There is no subplot to speak of. The direction is flat and linear and uninspiring. Peck is wooden. The Burmese actress is interesting but not fascinating. We're supposed to be up to our necks in danger, Japanese behind every bush, but apart from a tiny skirmish at the beginning, World War II could be happening a thousand miles away. Eric Ambler wrote the script and it is surprisingly uninspiring. The DVD picture quality is very good and the colors are bright and clear. Heaven knows it doesn't cost much. But I am simply mystefied how the other reviewers awarded this movie such a galaxy of stars. When supporting actor Bernard Lee ('M' in the early Bondflicks) is the most interesting character in the film, you know you're in trouble. Sorry to be the skunk at the picnic, but I just cannot see what all the fuss is about.",1116201600,8,1164,4.738916256157635
2207027,5,B00079ZACW,I love this film.  Peck was never better.  The sense of someone finally finding one's self is real.  War is presented in a different light.  Highly recommended,1114819200,7,159,4.777777777777778
2207028,4,B00079ZACW,"The silly lawsuit filed against MGM about nonsensical framing issues shouldn't lead to greet all MGM DVDs with suspicion. I didn't see this movie in theaters, but obviously it wasn't shot in any anamorphic aspect ratio, and widescreen movies in UK were not shot in 1,85:1 at the time. True, the DVD image seems a bit cramped at times, so my guess is, what we have here is an slightly reframed open matte version of a movie with an intended theatrical aspect ratio of 1,66:1 or maybe 1,75:1. But then, it's always difficult to check the exact aspect ratio delivered by a DVD because of the overscan inherent to most TV monitors (give it a try on your PC DVD drive, there's no overscan there)",1114387200,6,690,4.528
2207029,4,B00079ZACW,"It was unfortunate that the now-defunct MGM (Sony currently owns it) put the ""modified to fit your screen"" text at the beginning of ""THE PURPLE PLAIN"" DVD, as it simply was not necessary.  Based on my knowledge of aspect ratios, the full-frame (1:33) presentation is likely the most accurate framing for this film.  To my eyes, nothing was missing and no panning-and-scanning was to be seen.

According to an online review at DVD Talk, ""although the main titles appear to be composed for 1:66, a 1:78 crop-off is too much.  Released in 1954 and shot by an English crew, it could have easily been planned as a 1:37 release."" So enjoy this film and tell your friends and family about it.  It truly is a lost classic and this DVD is a long-overdue treasure.

The Scoffer has spoken...again!",1114300800,4,787,4.666666666666667
2207030,5,B00079ZACW,"This is it, the movie I've been waiting for.  No longer do we need to buy the old video store copies off Ebay for $50, we finally get it on DVD.

I cannot wait until Apr. 19, I can only hope that they do this marvelous film justice, however at this point any DVD version will be greatly appreciated.

2207062,4,B00079ZACW,"Excellent WWII movie with a love story. This movie has excellent air battle scenes, and reflects the role of Burma in WWII fairly well. The men find themselves trekking across Burma in an attempt to survive an unplanned event. Solid characters and acting. Gregory Peck has serious mental problems from a broken heart due to a casualty of war. He is hopeless, reckless, and does not trust anybody. However, the odd doctor who he's assigned to after he freaks out a few too many times, introduces him to a woman who gives him a new lease on life. But can he make it back to her? Redone in HD, this is a must see for any WWII movie lover, as well as showing the more exotic venue of the war and the beautiful community it tears apart. 4.5 Stars, highly recommended.",1486166400,4,762,4.411347517730497

2207238,4,B00079ZACW,"The Purple Plain stars Gregory Peck as ace Canadian squadron leader Bill Forrester in this World War II drama that takes place in Burma. Having lost his bride in a Luftwaffe air raid, bomber pilot Forrester has become a tortured soul who suffers from nightmares. His men and commander (Anthony Bushell) believe he is dangerous to fly with because he takes far too many risks and appears to have a death wish. However, his courage and flying skills are exceptional. The squadron physician is assigned to determine the embittered pilots fitness for duty.

Filmed in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to substitute for Burma and released in 1954, this nearly forgotten Technicolor production combines traditional war drama action with a psychological portrait. Peck offers a solid performance as Forrester. Director Robert Parrish presents a sympathetic perspective on Forrester and Pecks star power gets the viewer in his corner, but the movie explored the collateral effects of war well before the medical profession had a fuller understanding of wartime trauma. Forrester fights his interior demons without seeking help and, in the process, endangers human life  his own and others. A romantic relationship with a Burmese woman (Win Min Than) gives him a new outlook on life.

The screenplay is by Eric Ambler (A Night to Remember, Topkapi), who wrote several scripts for such early dramatic anthology shows as Climax, Kraft Theatre, and Suspicion.

The new love helps him recover from the suicidal attitude he took in air missions he flew. It also helps him, despite  impossible odds, to find his way back from a plane crash, with one of his two passengers. An enjoyable movie.

I will tell you that this is not the best performance of Peck's that I have seen, but it is more than adequate for this movie. The models used in some of the scenes were not very unconvincing. The direction was not the best. Overall, I would say that this movie failed Peck, rather than Peck not meeting the needs of this film.

I thought Mr. Peck's acting left much to be desired in these two movies, and his chemistry with Ava Gardner in On the Beach was non-existent.  She looked kind of worn. Part of the problem with the movie may be that the scenario in 1959 does not play well in 2014.",1389657600,,490,4.09375

2207336,4,B00079ZACW,"Pork Chop Hill along with Twelve O'Clock High showcases Gregory Peck's immense talent in portraying men dealing with the extreme stress of making life and death decisions.  Instead of just your typical ""war"" films, they center on the almost impossible difficulty of making decisions that will result in men's deaths during the stress of combat.  Few actors are capable of doing this believably but Gregory Peck is outstanding in these roles.

Pork Chop HIll is a true story and Peck is playing a real combat commander caught in an impossible situation in trying to re-take a hill in Korea that was over-run by the Chinese right at the end of the war.  It is a hill that on the surface is worth nothing, especially dying for.  How do you lead men effectively under these difficult circumstances.  Gregory Peck and the real soldier he plays provide the answer better than almost any other combat film made.  In much more recent combat films, Saving Private Ryan and Tom Hanks well acted role probably come closets to capturing this difficult dilemma of leadership.",1388275200,,1062,4.866666666666666

Unlike TOH The Purple Plain has virtually no combat, but it is similar in that it examines how men under pressure cope, or fail to cope.  The irony of this story is that Forrester (Peck's character) loses his reason for living and tries very hard to die, which as he points out, should be quite easy in a war, but instead gets medals for reckless bravery.  When he finally finds a reason to live, he crashes his plane and has to struggle to survive and to keep his navigator and passenger alive in impossible circumstances.  Some excellent acting all round from Peck and the British and Australian cast.  The beautiful Win Min Than, in her only film, played the female lead and gave a very believable performance.

2207397,4,B00079ZACW,"Assam in Eastern India, 1944. Squadron Leader Bill Forrester (Gregory Peck) is a Canadian serving in Royal Air Force and flying a DeHavilland Mosquito - a twin engine, two seated, very fast and VERY powerfully armed fighter-bomber. Because of his skill and agressivity, he is a real life legend amongst allied pilots serving in India-Burma-China theater - but nobody really likes to fly with him (or next to him) and his superiors consider him a liability rather than an asset.

Why? Because Squadron Leader Bill Forrester is suicidal! It is not a secret that he wants to die - and that he was trying to do so for the last four years (the reason will not be explained here, to avoid spoilers). But the Grim Reaper has a particularly nasty sense of humor and sometimes, when somebody looks for him very hard, HE very skillfully avoids him. And so, even if many have fallen on his left and more have fallen on his right, Squadron Leader Bill Forrester always survived, just getting more medals, promotions, scars and hangovers...

His commanding officer, Wing Commander Aldridge (Anthony Bushell) orders finally his medical officer, Doctor Harris (Bernard Lee, of 007 fame...) to either heal Forrester depression or find a medical reason to reform him and send him back to England. Doctor Harris will attempt to help Forrester by ending his isolation. As Forrester has no friends and no hobbies, doctor Harris will encourage him to give some time to assist a local shelter for displaced people (mostly Burmese refugees). The manager of this place is a formidable Scottish lady Ms Mac Nab(Brenda De Banzie) widow of a missionary, who spend almost all her life in Asia and in large part ""went native"". It is not possible to remain depressed anywhere near Ms Mac Nab, as she has more energy, character, wits, guts and spirit than even a dozen living bodies could contain.

And so Bill Forrester will start his convalescence - greatly helped in it by him meeting a delicious, young, adorable Burmese Christian refugee, Anna. This character is played by a Burmese actress, Win Min Than in her only cinema role (she later became a buddhist nun). Win Min Than played Anna in an absolutely perfect way and she is at least as much the star of this film as Gregory Peck.

All of this covers basically the first quarter of the film. But as it was already said, the Grim Reaper has a particularly nasty sense of humor - and now, that Bill Forrester have found again that life has a sweet taste, the shadow which avoided him for the last four years, will come back... And if it is not always so easy to catch with the Grim Reaper, HE usually has no trouble to catch up with us... Especially, when somebody flies almost every day dangerous missions over Japanese occupied Burma, where Zeros prowl the skies and flak can hide behind any bush. Burma which includes fertile rice fields, lush jungles, but also (it is less known) some hostile, red hot plains, covered with thorny shrub, where during the dry season water is scarce but where poisonous snakes slither by bushels...

I liked this ""oldie but goldie"" (made in 1954). It is not an immortal masterpiece, but a good, very honest, interesting and touching film, in which you really are concerned for the two main heroes, especially in the second part of the film... Do not expect a lot of military action, but survival scenes in the most hostile part of Burma wilderness are very strong. Scenario is very solid and logical and actors are GREAT. Gregory Peck was a real giant amongst actors and his young, exotic partner gave an exceptionnal performance. Bernard Lee and Brenda De Banzie are perfect as second roles.

I spend a nice moment watching ""The Purple Plain"" and I recommend it warmly. Enjoy!",1339545600,3,3738,4.743076923076923
2207398,3,B00079ZACW,"I adore Gregory Peck! So I do not come to this movie unbiased. This is a British film that I had never seen before, and as a matter of fact, I'm not sure I'd even heard of it before. But it starred Peck, so I bought it. Awfully glad I did.

Peck plays Forrester, a Canadian fighter pilot who is flying for the RAF. He lost his brand new wife in a London bombing, and it left him bitter and reckless. He admits he was trying to get himself killed ever since. Problem is, nobody wants to fly with him anymore. The navigator who was with him when the film opens in Burma was wounded because Forrester decided to go below the ack ack shooting when his orders were to get above it. Instead he managed to bomb the gunner nest where it was coming from. So he's a hero once again, but the wounded navigator is glad he was wounded: he won't have to fly with Forrester anymore.

The doctor and the commanding officer think he is cracking up, so the doc takes Forrester with him when he goes to visit a missionary and her Christian Burmese assistants, and meets the beautiful and soft-spoken Anna, played by Win Min Than (sounds Vietnamese to me). He is utterly charmed. He goes to see her again just before leaving on what is to be a routine mission, and she gives him a Burmese ruby ""to keep for me."" He promises her he will come back.

So he and his new navigator, and Blor, who had been his tent-mate and was headed for a new assignment, are packed into his little Mosquito plane to fly over Japanese-held territory to (a) deliver Blor and (b) give the new navigator, a very young kid, a chance to fly with him and get to know the routine. No big deal, until one of his engines catches fire, the extinguisher fails to put it out, and they have to ditch. The navigator's leg is burned by the fire as they are escaping from the plane, which then bursts into a huge flame when the fuel tank blows.

So there's the three of them, about 20 miles inside Japanese-held territory, with one severely injured and only a little water. No food, and not much else. Blor has Forrester turn out his pockets, mentioning that anything, however trivial, might be useful to their survival. So Blor sees the ruby, and comments, ""Don't tell me you've been buying those, too. They're all fake, you know."" (He's wrong there; Burma is a source of quite a few precious gems, including rubies.) Forrester does not comment, but just stuffs it back in his pocket.

Blor wants to stay with the wreckage (ashes, mostly) of the plane, and wait for rescue. But Forrester points out that they are in Jap territory, and may be found by Japanese before the RAF can locate them. And in fact, the RAF concludes that they burned up with the plane and aren't even looking for them. So Forrester insists they must walk out of this desert to the river which is about 20 miles away, and he and Blor will have to carry the navigator. Blor complains and argues all the way, but Forrester outranks him, so he cooperates for awhile.

I'm not going to spoil the ending, but let's just say Forrester kept his promise to Anna. He came back to her.

It's a good movie, mostly because Peck and Than make such a sweet couple, and because I adore Gregory Peck. He gives a superb performance in this movie, but then he always does. But it's not a great movie, so I can only give it three stars.",1337126400,3,3333,4.331730769230769
2207399,3,B00079ZACW,"Set during the Burma campaign in 1944, Gregory Peck plays a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force, ""Squadron Leader Forrester,"" fatigued by the war, still traumatized by the death of his wife in a London bombing.  His healing begins when he visits a Burmese village with his squadron's doctor, and meets ""Anna,"" played by Win Min Than.

While the film received good reviews when it opened in 1957, other films better treat PTSD, combat fatigue, escape and evasion, intercultural affection, missionary devotion, and the Burma campaign.  There are some good scenes with the de Havilland Mosquito bomber, but there are better aviation films.

Still, Peck's performance is a good one.  There's a moving scene of the unchurched ""Forrester"" joining missionaries and Burmese Christians singing an Easter hymn.  Agreeably, Win Min Than's portrayal of an Asian woman does not play to stereotypes.  Brenda de Banzie's performance as a Scottish missionary is striking and engaging.  Filmed in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), there's some fine scenery.  Interestingly, Win Min Than never made another film.

In the film, Peck was put to the test when his aircraft crashes behind Japanese lines.  Those interested in crisis leadership and survival can compare Peck's leadership with the behavior of another officer in the group -- positive and dysfunctional roles, if you will.

Not a home run, but a good solid double.

2207400,5,B00079ZACW,"Gregory Peck stars as a man who lost his wife in a London bombing raid on the night of his wedding.  If that wasn't bad enough, he even failed to kill himself, taking on risky missions that earned him medals rather than death.

We meet the man as he is stationed at a far Burma air strip working with the English towards the final years of World War II with Japanese incursions in the area.  He meets a woman, Anna, played awesomely by Miss Win Min Than.  That Hollywood would use an actual Asian actress was amazing in itself, but also to hint at an interracial romance was also quite a major breakthrough, especially for 1950s filmmaking.  So happy to see this change.

Several themes in this war film:  once having had a major tragedy, you can either give up or find a reason to live.  Squadron leader Forrester (Peck) has had a major tragedy, but through the help of the beautiful Anna, finds a reason to live.

When he crash-lands inside enemy lines, his passenger Bore, confronts his tragedy through suicide.  He has something to live for, yet fails to deliver and gives up.

Memorable Moment:  Anna says that the Burmese bury their dead in the earth, not in their hearts.  This had the expected effect on Forrester -- maybe he has lived with this burden for so long that it has poisoned his life -- that not giving up and having something to live for is the answer.

Per IMDB, this was Miss Win Min Than's only Hollywood film, which is really too bad.  She was excellent.

DVD:  Only scene selections and language selections.  No commentary, no nothing!

Bottom Line:  I was quite impressed with this film.  The ending was not expected and I thought was sweet.  Except for a bomb or two, not a lot of battle scenes; quite character driven.  Recommended.",1310860800,5,1760,4.517460317460317

Peck must then find a way to get them out of Japanese territory to their own lines. Survival in Burma during the Summer months is grueling and makes their treck back all the harder. The Bombadier was badly burned in the crash and requires the other two to carry him. This is not a well known movie but I think worth at least a rental. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.

Yet another hero saved by a good woman. The story and the characters just lack depth. You can't get into his sorrow over his wife because you don't know her. After he agonizes over her to the point of mental disease, he becomes a new man after meeting another woman for about a total of 3 hours. It just doesn't add up. On the other hand, the acting is very good across the board.",1233360000,,542,4.122641509433962

The characters are, well, characters, in the ""British"" sense. That means, that they are drawn with clearly delineated strengths and weaknesses, and are each rather eccentric in their own way. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Peck's acting and might have missed this one.

2207405,4,B00079ZACW,"In this enjoyable wartime yarn (set in WWII Burma) the Royal Canadian Air Force would have been proud of Gregory Peck as the angry, deeply troubled pilot who literally battles 'through adversity to reach the stars' (or in this case star - the enchanting Anna played by actress Win Min Than). Peck as Forrester is haunted by the loss of his wife killed during a German bombing raid on London. Through a series of nighmares, flashbacks and some atmospheric use of sound while Peck lays soaked with perspiration in his tiny tent, Director Robert Parrish brings the H E Bates novel and Eric Ambler's screenplay to life.

Memorable performances from British screen stalwarts Maurice Denham (Blore), Bernard Lee (Dr Harris)and Lyndon Brook (Carrington)together with Ambler's racey pacey script keeps audiences guessing to the end.  Brenda De Banzie's wonderful performance as missionary 'Miss McNab' and Win Min Than as the beautiful, gentle 'Anna' are just what the doctor ordered for the brooding Forrester as he battles behind Japanese lines when his Mosiquito fighter-bomber crashes on a routine mission.

Released in 1954, when the British War movie genre was in full flow, Parrish manages moments of Hitchcock in a taut psychological drama of Peck against the elements driven by duty, personal pride and the beautiful Anna who waits anxiously in a Burmese village. It might not be a classic (whatever that might be) but The Purple Plain nevertheless captivates and entertains through tragedy, love and action-packed drama. Well done Greg! And well done cast, crew and writers! Chocks away chaps!",1147996800,23,1595,5.174418604651163
2207406,4,B00079ZACW,"The Purple Plain is a winner, a handsomely mounted WW2 drama set in Burma where the Japanese are never seen: the enemy is the hostile landscape and the memories that cripple its hero. Gregory Peck's damaged pilot is still suffering from a bad case of 12 O'Clock High after the death of his wife in an air raid on their wedding night until he falls for Burmese girl Win Min Tan. (This being 1954, they may share an inter-racial romance, but they never actually kiss.) Naturally, as soon as he rediscovers a reason for living he's shot down behind enemy lines and has to make it back with not one but two crippled comrades. It's not much of a plot, true, but it's handled extremely well thanks to Robert Parrish's direction, which is surprisingly strong, direct and imaginative when called for, but still knows when to be unobtrusive as well. Great last shot too.",1143417600,9,861,4.597402597402597

Hot Toasty Rag, August 24, 2017

Without Gregory Pecks wonderful actingand handsomenessThe Purple Plain would be a pretty lousy movie. Theres nothing particularly spectacular about the plot; its a story of a shell-shocked pilot in WWII. There are a couple of tension-filled scenes where Greg and his fellow soldiers are up in their airplanes, but in general, the film felt like it didn't know what it wanted to be. Is it a romance, a war story, a survival adventure, or a racial lesson? Theres a little of each element in the story, but not enough of the writing was invested to make any of them very believable. If you really love Gregory Peck, you can watch it, since he does do a very good job, putting extra nuances into his lines that other actors wouldnt. But if you're looking for a good war movie, this isn't it.

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie is not your friend. Gregory Peck has a flashback, and the camera gets a little fuzzy and shaky, so be on the lookout. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1503532800,,1084,4.49746192893401
