3764928,5,B001QFYJZU,"I was utterly blown away by The Road to Fondwa.  As someone who has worked with both development scholars and filmmakers, I am amazed at the skill of Brandon, Schnorr, and McElroy to bring the statistics of development to life in an engaging story that is visually magnificent.  The Road to Fondwa has profoundly impacted my impressions of Haiti and is a true testament to the incredible impact that can be made by a few dedicated individuals.  After seeing this film, I contacted the filmmakers to set up a screening and would encourage everyone to do the same!",1239408000,5,562,4.714285714285714
3764929,5,B001QFYJZU,"We see and feel challenges all around the world...  We are experiencing momentous growing pains...  Wanna see some people choosing empathy, community, and problem solving as you take a journey through an involving and vibrant viewing experience?  Jump on ""The Road to Fondwa.""",1239408000,2,276,5.372093023255814
3764930,5,B001QFYJZU,"I'm a huge fan of this film. Amazing colors, panoramics, sounds, words, a rocking soundtrack ... and a message that both makes you want to be more involved in development and also makes you believe in the power of the human spirit to work together for change. Kudos to the filmmakers - I think they were wise to realize that the movie wasn't about them - the real story is the strength of the people of Fondwa. They're on a ""konbit,"" and it's awesome to see.

The filmmakers take you up close without seeming invasive, they inspire you to do something without feeling like the first world is evil, and they are hopeful about Haiti's future without being disingenuous about the challenges. In my view this is the gold standard for a new type of documentary about the developing world. You have to see it!",1239408000,2,803,4.537931034482758
3764931,5,B001QFYJZU,"Wow!  Incredibly uplifting to see how people with so little can have so much!  Must've been fun to make, too.",1237852800,,109,4.4
3764932,4,B001QFYJZU,"I was fortunate to see this film at a screening in Los Angeles. The documentary is a great window into the life of those living in Fondwa and the major cities of Haiti. It focuses greatly on the daily struggles Haitain's encounter. It has an uplifting message, urging people to help those in Fondwa not through monetary gains, but by teaching them crafts and farming techniques that will improve their life. As one wise interviewee states, ""Do not give me a fish, but teach me how to fish."" The documentary goes further to illustrate how the people of Fondwa are trying to improve their lives by creating a university and organizing community groups. Definitely give this documentary a viewing.",1237766400,,694,4.840336134453781
3764933,5,B001QFYJZU,"""The Road to Fondwa"" provides a unique window into the struggles and aspirations of Haiti, an impoverished nation rich with potential and human spirit.  Perhaps the greatest message of this film is that self-empowerment is the most effective method for addressing the numerous crises facing the developing world.  With a specific focus on rural development and education ""The Road to Fondwa"" paints a graphic picture of the daunting challenges that face the island and its people.  The filmmakers eloquently capture the incredible resilience and hunger for change that define the Haitian people, ensuring that viewers emerge with a sense of optimism and possibility.  I would definitely recommend this documentary for anyone who wants to learn about Haiti, or the process of development more generally.  Congratulations on a job well done by Dan Schnorr and Justin Brandon.",1237766400,,873,5.389705882352941
3764934,5,B001QFYJZU,As a frequent traveler to Haiti this film is excellent at showing hope and possibility which is not portrayed in the international media. BRAVO to the makers of this documentary in showcasing how education can break the cycle of poverty.,1237680000,3,237,4.95
3764935,5,B001QFYJZU,"Finally, a documentary that shows Haiti's potential and the potential within us all.  As a Haitian it made me proud, and as a human being it made me want to dance!",1234483200,2,163,4.258064516129032
3764936,5,B001QFYJZU,"This film shows the struggles and triumphs of the town Fondwa, in Haiti, a country only 600 miles from our shores. The directors have done a fantastic job of portraying the stories of Haitians who are doing everything they can to not only get by, but to succeed. After seeing the new school built for the children and the struggles to build roads and housing, you will be moved to action, to stand up for Haiti and help.

I just checked out their website: [...] where they have more info.

Great film! Help support Haiti by buying this film and sharing it with your friends!",1233100800,6,574,4.457142857142857
3764937,5,B001QFYJZU,"I was fortunate to attend a packed San Francisco screening of the ""Road to Fondwa"" hosted by the documentary's director and producer, Justin Brandon. In his second documentary- Brandon and his team tell the amazing story of a marginalized nation and its people, who, in the face of all calamity have banded together as a community to create their own infrastructure, amplify their own education, and ultimately, to realize their full potential as Haitians and as humans.  The word ""konbit"" in Creole signifies that when we all put our efforts together the work is lighter - it's a sentiment of coming together for a greater purpose.  This documentary offers a window into the opportunities of community.  It is vibrant, lyrical, poignant and touching.  Using his lens as both a kaleidoscope and a paintbrush, Brandon underlines the larger themes of human potentiality.  Yes, this film is about Haiti, but so too is it about something much larger, something far more elemental.  We have seen how the hyper-connectivity of modernity links us tighter together.  John Donne taught us that ""no man is an island,"" and as Americans separated by only the briefest sliver of water from our Haitian brothers, it would be wise to remember that as global citizens we learn a lesson in camaraderie and common purpose that ""The Road to Fondwa so eloquently provides.  The documentary shows that when we act as one, anything is possible.  The only insurmountable adversity is the one we create in our own solitude.",1233100800,8,1499,4.9879518072289155
3764938,5,B001QFYJZU,"I saw a screening of this film in South Bend, Indiana.  Rather than shocking viewers with multiple shots of squalor and despair, this film shows a community that is taking an active hand in its own development.  It's nice to see another side of Haiti!",1240099200,,251,4.555555555555555
3764939,5,B001QFYJZU,"I have lived and worked in several developing countries and this video was inspiring for its message and its promotion of a replicable example that comes from the ground up.  In Catholic Social Teaching, subsidiarity, involving those at the most basic levels, is one of the chief principles.  The people of Fondwa exemplify this principle and show that it can work.  More importantly, while aid from others is important, it shows that an internal change can steadily grow to create wonderful things.  I highly recommend this film for those with an interest in Haiti, but also for all of those that have a desire to learn more about developing countries and ways to connect with those who live there.",1240012800,,699,4.848739495798319
3764940,5,B001QFYJZU,"I just attended a screening today.  This is a very well done documentary that shows the positive change being made by a local community to bring themselves out of poverty.  With all the negative images we see of the developing world that only depict starving children or dirty streets, it was nice to see a film that focuses on the joy and hope found in a community facing the challenges of extreme poverty and their extraordinary efforts to pull themselves out of it.  Well done!",1239840000,,480,4.623529411764705
3764941,5,B001QFYJZU,This documentary is such a powerful and inspiring film.  There is an amazing depiction of God within the Haitian people.  They truly are our brothers and sisters who need our attention and help in order to live in solidarity.  This movie opened my eyes to the type of poverty in Haiti and excites many ideas of how to love and help our neighbors in Haiti.,1239840000,,355,4.430769230769231
3764942,5,B001QFYJZU,"The Road to Fondwa was screened last night to a packed house in South Bend, Indiana, at Saint Mary's College.  The cinematography was beautiful, capturing the Haitian people sharing their struggles, aspirations, and hopes.  Despite the challenges Haiti faces, director Justin Brandon revealed a side of Haiti that is not often shared in the mainstream media - the efforts of people to empower themselves to bring change to the country.  As a community Fondwa is amazing in helping to promote development that is initiated and maintained by the people themselves.  Brandon is a master storyteller - we become involved and engaged in the lives of the people he introduces us to.  I am grateful for the experience of having seen this film and it inspires me to find ways to learn more about Haiti's challenges and ways I might help support the efforts of those in Fondwa.",1239840000,2,868,4.877551020408164
3764943,5,B001QFYJZU,"This documentary is essentially a local vignette. It keeps things local but its impact is global. It focuses on an educational project in a small town - how villagers can create a knowledge community. For those unfamiliar with Haiti (or too familiar with the negative press), this is a refreshing look at how a small community can make a dramatic impact. The documentary is full of homespun villagers that make you feel as if you were trekking through the town on barefoot. I recommend anyone to trek to the closest screening to watch this film. I was blown away by the high quality production and story telling ability of the documentary makers.",1239753600,2,646,4.776785714285714

The Road to Fondwa is a beautiful film made with incredible heart.  It's a documentary that doesn't try to shock or sadden its viewers with scenes of extreme poverty.  It's picture of Haiti is real.  It shows the hardships but it also focuses on the beautiful countryside and the unrelenting spirit of the Haitian people.  The shots of Haiti were absolutely beautiful and made me fall in love with the country even though I've never set foot there.  It's truly a great piece of work and highly recommended!",1239580800,3,660,5.894736842105263
3764945,5,B001QFYJZU,"""The Road to Fondwa"" is an amazing documentary, created by a truly gifted young filmmaker named Justin Brandon. I would not be surprised if this grassroots project makes it all the way to the Academy Awards podium. This is brilliant storytelling, coupled with vibrant imagery, showcasing the color and beauty of the Haitian people. Watch this film and change how you think about Haiti forever.",1239408000,,393,5.061538461538461
3764946,5,B001QFYJZU,"So often we only see the unfortunate tragedies of Haiti. ""The Road to Fondwa"" brings to light the incredible spirit of the Haitian people. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",1239408000,,183,4.75
3764947,5,B001QFYJZU,"""If the purpose of The Road to Fondwa is to make viewers aware of the natural catastrophes that strain Haiti's ecological system and result in horrific living conditions - then this documentary gets two thumbs up. What makes it all the more splendid is that it demonstrates how the inhabitants there pull together to create churches, schools and other organizations to better their society. Despite the challenging living conditions, the Haitians in the film are dedicated to working hard and are evidently grateful for the little they have. What touched me the most was their ability to wear such genuine smiles among the chaos.
SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!""",1239408000,,653,5.11214953271028
8335603,5,B001QFYJZU,"After having returned from doing medical relief and working at the clinic in Fondwa I was happy to see this film.  The message of sustainability, job-creation, and Haitian-led action for the country was refreshing.  Very hopeful, very accurate.",1298678400,,244,5.394736842105263
8335604,5,B001QFYJZU,"I have been working to help develop a school in the NE of Haiti for the past 25 years. This film was the first to really capture what it feels like to be in Haiti.

I thought the DVD was impressive in the way the film showed both the nitty gritty of life in Haiti but yet caught the positive spirit of the people. Not an easy thing to juggle.

The one interview with the woman toward the end really brought that out--how all images of Haiti in the media are negative and disastrous. The whole film balanced that out nicely.

Don't think twice: buy this film and invite a group of friends over to see it!",1252281600,3,603,4.136752136752137
8335605,5,B001QFYJZU,"This is a very touching documentary. Aside, from portraying the daily struggle of the people in Fondwa, it also captures what every Haitians want to do, which is the pursuit of their own progress.

I am glad to have seen the whole documentary, and I strongly believe Haiti needs more Road to Fondwa to show to the rest of the world that Haitians are seeking their own solutions to Haiti's illness.

Thank you so much for this documentary, and I would recommend with no reserve to anyone interesting in Haiti and its people.",1247011200,,523,4.612903225806452
8335606,5,B001QFYJZU,"I attended the seattle film festival and caught the Road to Fondwa...wow!

I could not help smiling and inspiration as I leaned forward in my chair taking in the good news that is going on in Haiti.  A key line in the movie was when a haitian lady said the international media has a negative view of haiti...they never show the beauty, hope and courage of the people. Right on!  I highly recommend this film for youth groups, rotary clubs, etc,

8335607,5,B001QFYJZU,"After 3 years of paying close attention (i.e. obsession) to news and media about Haiti (and 4 trips to Leogane), this film is the best depiction of the country I've seen.  It gives Haitians voice--subtitles, not voice-dubs.  Honest about the country's desperation, but hopeful because the solidarity Haitians feel with each other underlies the whole film.  A must see.",1242691200,,368,5.203389830508475
8335608,5,B001QFYJZU,"Thank you for making a documentary about the beautiful people of Haiti.  It is so important that we take a look at the everyday life of  haitian.  Haiti has so much to offer, and so much beauty.  Your documentary gives people a glimpse of the everyday struggles that they face.  It is nice to see people that love haiti, and have given the haitian people a voice.",1241654400,,363,4.358208955223881
8335609,4,B001QFYJZU,"This is not your typical boring doco but a true sneak peek into the real lives of every day people struggling to meet challenges you and I will never know. It's short, to the point, wonderfully done and charming, all while revealing a fantastic culture made more beautiful by its hardship.",1241481600,,289,4.686274509803922
8335610,5,B001QFYJZU,"Wow! I was so impressed by The Road to Fondwa. This film really captures the humanity, creativity and resilience of the Haitian people, challenging my stereotypes of people in poverty-stricken nations. I was especially fascinated to learn about the University of Fondwa where people cooperate to learn the skills needed in their (mostly rural) communities. The students' education is focused on developement and returning to give back to their own people - so important in a country where rural populations are loosing population, food shortages are common and cities are becoming overcrowded with slums. The students speak with gratitude and a sense of identity and pride in having something concrete to offer in the struggle against poverty. I purchased a copy of this film and I plan to share it with anyone interested in developement, education, rural revitalization, or HUMANITY in general! I highly recommend it!",1240704000,,918,5.294520547945205
8335611,5,B001QFYJZU,"There is something beautiful and lasting about The Road to Fondwa.  The music and cinematography immediately grab hold and pull you into its world.  A world that is visually stunning and musically alive.  What remains with you long after your journey is the vitality, spirit and resilience of Haiti and its people. It is evident that the filmmakers are incredibly talented, not only because this documentary skillfully captures the vivid beauty of Haiti but more so because as storytellers they embraced the spirit, love, and hopes of the people they meet.  Fondwa is so engaging I stopped relating to myself as an audience member at all. Instead I found myself caring more deeply for my fellow man, not with pity but with inspiration. The Road to Fondwa reminded me that the effort to empower yourself and bring change to your country is not only noble but also possible.

I highly recommend seeing The Road to Fondwa!",1240185600,,919,4.865384615384615
