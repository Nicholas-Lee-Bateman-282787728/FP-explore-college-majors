8321912,1,B001MVFE4S,Old movie that could have benefited from enhancement software. So hard to see ANY detail that the story line and imaging were pretty much completely lost. Kept it in hopes of finding a user friendly software format that I could use to at least bring the video portion back to a viewable stage.,1432598400,,293,4.547169811320755
8321913,1,B001MVFE4S,"Story was good for a ""B"" movie.  What was disappointing was the quality of the video. Very blurred copy of film.",1398038400,,112,4.333333333333333
8321914,5,B001MVFE4S,I chose this rating because like others I remember it from over 60 years ago and I have never forgotten it. I tried in the past to find a copy to no avail. Now it looks like I will eventually be able to see it again.,1377993600,3,216,3.717391304347826
8321915,2,B001MVFE4S,"I bought this movie because I remembered seeing it at the age of six when it first came out.  The message I got from it then was that if there was a war, I could use that as an opportunity to kill all the people I hated. Not a very good lesson for a six year old kid.

Some are touched by the heroism of the main character, and yes, one could say he was heroic, but what is heroic about a tough little guy full of anger?

The stars.  Why two stars?  The story was pretty skinny, I mean, not much substance, not much history told.  I really was expecting more.

The price is way beyond what it was worth to me.",1328140800,3,609,3.902439024390244
8321916,5,B001MVFE4S,"This movie is nostalgic for me. As a young boy I watched this movie often on TV. There are a few blemishes due to the condition of the original tape, but overall this is a treasure in my collection!",1304294400,4,198,4.102564102564102
8321917,4,B001MVFE4S,my husband had seen this movie when he was a youth and we had look for it often and were always told it was not in print.  I was pleased to be able to get a copy for him for Christmas.  The quality of the actual footage is not great but the basic story of the young boy and his dedication to the Flying Tigers still comes through.  It is worth a watch for Flying Tiger fans!,1295395200,4,374,3.831168831168831
8321918,5,B001MVFE4S,"This movie was moving, inspiring, and it made you cry. A little piece of history. These children are amazing in the fact that they were brave enough not to let the enemy take control of there lives.",1239926400,8,198,4.378378378378378
