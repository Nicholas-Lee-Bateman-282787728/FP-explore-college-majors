8254007,5,B00141VKD0,"I would recommend Ammy customers who are interested in 1800s era history purchase this double feature package, because both movies are exceptionally well-done, not a bit boring, and thoroughly entertaining at a grand combined total of 6 hours.

Buffalo Girls is the story of Calamity Jane and her search to find her child years after giving it away to a barren couple in the aftermath of Wild Bill Hicock's murder.  It's also about her true friends Dora and Blue who endure a tortured love affair, wise Native American No Ears, and the explorers Jim and Bartle Bone.  There are highlights of Little Big Horn, the taming of the frontier, a nasty blizzard, and plenty of tear jerking moments all around.  Anjelica Houston is fabulous as the lead character Calam, and she brings authentic grit and vulnerability to the role.  Well-casted all around.

True Women shows that back in the day women could do a whole lot more than cook and face the difficulties of childbirth.  When best friends Georgia and Phemie are are separated by Phemie's father's death, and she is sent to live with her sister Sarah and her brother-in-law, the movie begins a long multi-decade span of the adventures both girls experience before meeting again years later.  From the Texas-Mexican revolution to battling with the Comanches and the aftermath of the Civil War, there is a lot going on, and it manages to be dealt with well in a mere 3 hours!  Sarah has taught Phemie to hate Native Americans, yet despise slavery while Georgia has discovered her Native heritage and has several slaves.  Both women discover how to come to terms with this, and all three women become staunch supporters of women's sufferage.  With Angelina Jolie as you've never seen her, Annabeth Gish, and Dana Delaney as tough, admirable Sarah, there are a few tear jerkers in this story too, but I won't spoil the big moment.  I cried, though, when Phemie gave Tarantula (Michael Greyeyes) her horse.  An excellent package, it's hard to figure out which of the two movies is best.  One thing is certain though; it's worth both the money and time because the return is great!",1296604800,,2123,4.81267217630854
8254008,5,B00141VKD0,"Both films feature top female performers in some difficult roles and situations. All performances were excellent. They honored the women of fiction and fact from the past with grace, dignity and humor while staying as true as possible to historical understanding.",1257292800,4,263,5.439024390243903
8254009,5,B00141VKD0,Like reading a good book without all the garbage in it.  Both are good movies with a little touch of history. Women are strong in both of the movies and has a flair or western.,1243296000,6,176,4.0285714285714285
