6787825,5,B00P69WUEE,"Cheers! An exceptionally moving and brilliantly acted human drama featuring a cast of the screen' s creme de la creme. Young pre.  Titanic. Leo di. Caprio is electrifying stealing scenes with aplomb from. De. Niro and. Streep. The great. Diane. Keaton is heart breaking as the tragic. Bessie whose generosity and kindness propels the drama. Broadway legend. Gwen. Verdon is a delightful scene stealer. A brilliant gem. Have a box of tissues handy. An unforgetable experience! Luv, diana",1462752000,3,486,5.230769230769231

8686510,1,B00P69WUEE,I just bought this DVD and open the package to play the DVD and the DVD was skipping. Was waiting for it to stop but it kept skipping parts so I got mad and took it out of my DVD player. It is sad that you pay for something only to find out the product does not work.,1522108800,,267,3.6206896551724137

8686512,5,B00P69WUEE,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  I ordered this edition to replace my original copy.  Just want to add that the description of the film on the back cover is inaccurate.  It states that Lee left behind Bessie to care for their father, Marvin, but that's not the case.  Lee left, but it was Bessie who stayed behind to care for their father.  Also, the front cover choice is somewhat confusing.  I see why they'd want to show a beach (given one of the scenes), but why show the four unknown people walking on it, who have nothing to do with the movie?",1512432000,,556,4.247619047619048
