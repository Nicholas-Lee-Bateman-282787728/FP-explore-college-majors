613638,3,6303265774,"A decent sequel to Hellraiser. It gets a little muddled and vague in parts and doesn't have a particularly strong climax or ending, but it builds on Hellraiser's lore in interesting ways and the characters are unique and memorable.

I loved seeing the blood soaked mattress and Julia who gets to come back to play with (Snow White) Kirsty who was called that in the movie.

613745,5,6303265774,"Hellbound: Hellraiser II managed to do something that is often missed with recycled movies.  It actually polishes it up and makes it better than the original Hellraiser.  This is a deeper darker more mind bending movie.  Yes, the blood and guts and gore we've come to expect are still there and yes, the awesome Pinhead (Doug Bradley) is still kicking ass and taking names.

Hellbound is a serious mind game.  It's a maze of the mind.  There seems to be no correct turns.  Everywhere something out to get you.  The Cenobites are real and it only gets ugly when you meet them.",1464220800,,575,4.568627450980392

I don't know anything about encoding, I don't know if it has to do with the source material but the encoding its lame.  If you have the 20th anniversary DVD and a bluray player with a decent upscaler,  stay with it.

613911,4,6303265774,"The movie opens with a something of a highlights reel of the best and grossest scenes from part 1.  Continuing immediately from where Hellraiser (1987) ended, we find Kirsty (Ashley Laurence; Hellraiser, Warlock III) in a mental hospital where her account of what happened to her father, uncle Frank and stepmother Julia (Clare Higgins; Being Human) is received as more than a little hard to swallow.

Whereas Hellraiser (1987) delivered credible character reactions to an incredible evil force, Hellbound takes a nosedive into bonkersville in terms of plot believability.  I, in no way, mean this as a complaintI LOVE this movie.  But this ""movie"" is the point in the franchise when we stop using the word ""film.""  Clive Barkers infernal art and brilliant storytelling are behind us now.  It seems that perhaps our new director Tony Randel (Amityville: It's About Time, Fist of the North Star) was trying a little too hard to fill Horror Master Clive Barker's (Nightbreed, Hellraiser) shoes.  The gore--which was already heavy, sloppily gross and pleasurably unique in part one--is now turned up to an ""11"" and the plot elements seem to have shifted from credible to nonsense.  Almost every event in the story evidences this manianot that the horror genre is known for its storytelling.  In fact, as bonkers as it is, this story is told more eloquently than most horror (especially in the late 80s).

Now in a mental hospital, the doctor in charge of Kirsty's case just happens to be an amateur expert and collector obsessed with all things occult, especially the Puzzle Box and its history.  In other words, coincidence has been pushed to the extreme as Kirsty's caregiver has been waiting for this!  After Kirsty warns police to destroy the mattress on which Julia died in part 1 (because Kirsty somehow understands exactly how coming back from Hell works all the sudden), Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham; Hot Fuzz) somehow gets the police to deliver this murder case evidence to his private residence with the intentions of summoning Julia.  For a blood offering he checks out a deeply disturbed patient from the screaming basement ward of his mental hospital--it's what you'd expect from an 1800's mental hospitalin a horror movieon steroidsand then more extreme!!!  Dr. Channard seems to frequently bring disturbed patients to his home without restriction.

So clearly, this movie has gone to comicbook lengths to bring something crazy to the screen.  But you know what?  It remains crazy awesome!!!  I haven't read Clive Barker's books (on which this is based), but I think we can safely assume that these actions were all much more carefully explained and tactfully justified in his detailed pages.  Meanwhile, in Hellraiser movieland, no one seems concerned with the disappearance of several patients.

It may sound like Im slamming the plot.  Im not.  In fact, overall the story itself remains elegantly unique. After all, whatever liberties this director took in making this film, it is still based on Barkers refined writing.

After Julia's ""resurrection,"" she sexually beguiles Channard--even though she hasn't any skin--to help fully restore her with more victims.  He obliges and we get to enjoy a room full of life-drained corpses.  But this isn't enough for Channard.  He wants to know and see the secrets of the Hell that is The Labyrinth.  So he brings a mute patient with a knack for puzzle-solving to open the gate to Hell with the Puzzle Box.

Things get yet crazier as Channard and Julia wander the corridors of Hell.  He gets transformed into a Cenobite himself (simply referred to as ""the Channard Cenobite"") by the God of Hell Leviathan and is for some reason way tougher than Pinhead and his Cenobite gang.  He kills loads of people with his stop-motion bladed hand tentacles, so Kirsty gets Pinhead to see his inner child and wears Julia's skin as a suit.  A lot of cool stuff is happening, FOR SURE!

Whereas part 1 was entirely based on illustrating one mans escape from Hell and the temptations required to accomplish the task, this sequel addresses that component just in the first act and then moves on to exploring the Labyrinth and witnessing various personal Hells while being swiftly introduced to how Barkers Hell works and is ruled.  Despite the busy plot of this movie (it does cover a lot), it remains very dark and creepy and, more importantly, the plot makes sense.  We cant say that about a lot of horror.  Its gore-pleasing effects are abundant, the story pushes the Hellraiser franchise into a new dimension, and we learn more about the background of the Cenobites and the mythology behind Barkers Hellish Labyrinth.

This movie is buckets of cool and one of the more interesting horror installments (along with part 1) of its decade.

613965,5,6303265774,"So, there are a lot of questions that arise when watching this movie. For instance, I'd like to know why Pinhead and the others fight like such pansies when they take on the doctor; also, I'd like to know why they even do it in the first place. I just didn't believe that it was a natural reaction to being shown the picture. Regardless, this movie is so weird, and it does a lot of things they just don't normally do in horror movies.

I suppose that I give it five stars because this was my favorite Horror movie as a child, and still to this day I enjoy it. For me, there is nostalgia in this film. The old school special effects add to the bizarre feeling that the movie instills, and the acting is what you would expect from the genre and time of its making. Hopefully fans of Horror will give this movie a chance. I still believe it's one of the few movies out there that I can actually call scary. There's some surreal enviornments that will get into your head, and I'm sure you'll enjoy a nightmare or two after watching it.",1432425600,,1032,4.238578680203045

614063,2,6303265774,"Please be aware this review is for the USA (Region 1) ""Midnight Madness"" Blu Ray release by Image Entertainment. The score is for this particular release, NOT the movie itself which is a 5 star horror movie classic!!

Now that that's out of the way, BUYER BEWARE!! It's a damn shame Anchor Bay (long time rights holder to the New World Cinemas back catalog) did not get around to releasing this on Blu Ray before they farmed the rights for the Hellraisers out to Image Entertainment.

Unfortunately the picture quality of the 1.78:1 image on this release is not a huge step up from the Anchor Bay THX Digitally Remastered DVD. I'm fairly certain it's the exact same master transfer, simply AVC encoded at a higher 1080p resolution. This in itself is an upgrade, but it's all the upgrade you get, and it's frankly not an overly noticeable difference from the DVD upscaled unless you have a larger TV. There has been no dirt removal or cleanup on the image so dirt specs and print damage pop up every now and then, unlike the cleanup Anchor Bay did on the Hellraiser I Blu-Ray transfer (again, huge shame they didn't do this one too). Thankfully, this also means there has been no DNR applied. If there's a silver lining to be had, it's that the image does sharpen up and look pretty crisp for the most part after the opening recap of the previous movie and once they get out of the hospital. Truth be told, there's no denying this is the best Hellraiser II has ever looked but on the flipside, when compared with what Anchor Bay did for Hellraiser I on BluRay and what could have been, it's a travesty.

Audio comes in the form of a DTS 5.1 Master Audio track which is honestly the best thing about this release. Audio sounds full and surrounds are good considering the source.

And that's about it, really. There are no extras on this release, save for the theatrical trailer. No commentary track, no features or image galleries, not even a single page chapter list insert. Another reviewer said Image put ""absolutely no effort whatsoever"" into this release. Sorry to say folks, but this guy was giving them TOO MUCH credit.

If you currently own the aforementioned Anchor Bay THX Digital Remaster of Hellraiser II: Hellbound on DVD, I can't think of many reasons for wanting to pick this up unless you've got a larger TV and just HAVE to have that little extra bit of definition offered by the increased 1080p resolution. Even then, you're going to want to hang on to your THX DVD for the commentary track, two-page foldout trivia note insert, and extra features. If you don't currently own the movie, and don't already own Hellraiser I and III on BluRay, you may want to consider importing the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser-BluRay-Box/dp/B00509S7Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser BluRay Box</a>&nbsp;set instead of supporting this release. The advantages of the set are the first three movies in one place in a uniform matching set, a nice box with English titles on the face and spine that fits perfectly and looks great on your shelf amongst your single titles, a hi-def transfer of Hellraiser II either identical to or comparable to the transfer on this release, and last but certainly not least a great looking 1.78:1 hi-def transfer of the elusive Hellraiser III which is not otherwise available on Blu Ray individually in the U.S. at this time. The only drawback of the box set is the high price point at the time of this writing.",1416009600,2,3512,4.8369384359401

614065,4,6303265774,"Hellraiser II is a nicely scripted sequel to Hellraiser that delves further into the twisted world of the sick and perverse demon known as Pinhead.

The film opens with a nice background for viewers, starting somewhere in the 1920s where Elliot Spencer, British Army Captain solves the puzzle box in his Nissen hut. Expectantly, upon his solving of the box, chains emerge from it and dig into his flesh. The arm of the entity inside the box rises from the box and carves up Spencer's head before hammering nails into the wounds; turning Spencer into the legend known as Pinhead.

The movie then cuts to Kirsty Cotton who suddenly awakens in the Channard Psychiatric Institute, where she's being held, following the events of the previous Hellraiser. In addition, she's also questioned about said events that include the fiery destruction of her home, the murder of her stepmother, Julia, and a bloody mattress. While Kirsty tries to explain to police and staff workers, her story, she suddenly becomes the main interest of Kyle Macrae; the assistant of the head doctor; Dr. Channard.

Meanwhile, Kirsty befriends a young girl named Tiffany, who's also a patient at the institute and is semi-catatonic. Later in her room, Kirsty finds a message on her wall in blood saying I AM IN HELL HELP ME. Believing that the message is from her father, Larry, she enlists the aid of Kyle to help her by telling Dr. Channard about the Cenobites. However, Dr. Channard already knows everything, unbeknownst to Kyle and Kirsty both and goads a patient into killing himself on the bloody mattress that Kirsty mentioned earlier, where the corpse of Julia is brought back to life and consumes the patient before taking the form of a woman.

From there, the movie takes twist after twist as Kirsty with the help of Tiffany open the puzzle box and enter the depths of hell in hopes of searching out Larry Cotton and defeating the vile team of Dr. Channard and Julia",1413590400,,1945,4.81437125748503

I am a pretty big fan of the original and was told this is the best sequel and some have said it's even their favorite one. I have two words to say about this one, bad writing. The movie starts off pretty well and has some effective moments but I wish the plot was more coherent and they were a little more creative with the set pieces. I imagined the whole ""labyrinth"" thing would've been scarier and the cenobites in this one straight up suck as they aren't as scary and take on human like qualities. It was cool at first going into the backstory but it was totally a missed opportunity. The movie even has a short fight between the villain and the cenobites and it's a total fail.

614165,5,6303265774,"I've seen all of the films in the Hellraiser series and enjoyed them all on different levels even the last one in which they had a new actor play Pinhead. As a kid for some reason these films never appealed to me, I'm not sure I can say why now? It was few years ago that I decided to buy the complete collection and watch them all. Money well spent! I will likely get to reviewing all of the films in this series in time I chose this first because I recently heard a great interview with, Barbie Wilde, on the Full Circle Movie Talk podcast hosted by indie filmmaker Sean Weathers, I bought 2 of Sean's previous films that I liked and decided to check out his podcast online.

Being a fan of the original film, the first sequel to the never ending series, ""Hellbound"" is a both a fascinating watch and a frustrating experience. The film tries to expand on the mythology but it makes absolutely no sense and despite repeated viewings, there are far too many plot holes and too many questions that are left unanswered. Yes, I give credit to the film-makers for trying to recreate a nightmare on film and this film does have a rather hallucinatory, dream-like tone, even more so than the original, however I am unable to turn a blind eye to a nonsensical plot, mindless characters and  ridiculous turn of events.

Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), the survivor of the original film, returns (and looking as gorgeous as ever) and is in a psychiatric ward. The doctors and detectives are having a difficult time trying to understand (or believe) her story. Kirsty discovers that the bloody mattress her evil stepmother Julia (Claire Higgens) died in is being inspected and demands it be destroyed, fearing that Julia may be resurrected through it since it has her blood stains all over it (however I fail to see how she would know this since she was not present during Frank's resurrection in the first film). Anyhow, one of the doctors in the hospital is the evil Dr. Phillip Channard (Kenneth Cranham), who has a fascination with the Lament Configuration puzzle box and all things involving it and has quite the collection in his house. He executes a plan to resurrect the dead Julia (who is now more evil than ever and looking far more ravishing than in the first film) and to enter hell, I guess because it is every evil man's desire to go to a plain of existence we are all unfamiliar with and where evil, destructive entities reside *rollseyes*. Meanwhile Kirsty receives a message from a skinless (yes, skinless) man who writes on her bedroom wall using his own blood ""I AM IN HELL. HELP ME"". She assumes this bloodied messenger is her dead father Larry whom she believes is now in hell and yearning for her help so she decides to book a first-class ticket to hell to save him, even though her first experience in that realm and its creatures nearly caused Kirsty her life (first with that hell creature that chased her down the long, narrow tunnel and then with the Cenobites who nearly claimed her if it hadn't been for her quick thinking and sent them all back to hell via the puzzle box). So I pretty much have to believe this young girl is so fearless, she is going to hell, unprotected, to save her daddy from an eternity of torment? Shouldn't she have consulted with someone beforehand? I mean, going to hell is a big, freakin decision and one that should not be taken lightly and should not be decided upon without at least consulting with your neighborhood Priest. Anyhow, the evil Dr. Channard convinces a semi-catatonic patient, Tiffany, who is a master in solving puzzles, to open the lament configuration and in doing so, opens the portal to hell, releasing the leather-clad Cenobites however realizing Tiffany did not open the box out of selfish desire (she was tricked into doing so) they leave her alone and retrieve back into their hellish realm. But the sloppy demons leave the door to hell open so Kirsty, Tiffany, the now rejuvenated Julia and Dr. Channard all decide to take a day trip to Hell and this is where the film falls apart.

I understand this film has its legion of fans however I am unable to look past all of its weak points and kind of ridiculous plot twists. The original film was not perfect but at least it had structure and a story that (kind of) made sense and the characters were nowhere near as ridiculous as the characters in this film. In this sequel, all logic goes out the window. There is no rhyme, no reason, it is just one quirky, mad-cap, insane scene after another and the horror is pretty much lost as the film, despite having scenes of explicit gore, becomes an over-the-top fantasy extravaganza. The film starts off great, with a brief summarization of the original and a brief scene showing the origins of pin-head. Although not much is explained, we at least see a humanization of the infamous demon. Julia's resurrection scene is splendid and is so over-the-top disgusting you need to ensure you are not eating anything during that particular scene. The make-up effects is far more grisly here than it was in the original and there is somewhat of a buildup but the film reaches its peak once Tiffany opens the Lament Configuration and Pin-head and the Cenobites enter the picture. Once the action is moved to hell, the film goes down-hill and the new Cenobite that is introduced looks rather silly (I thought clay-mation went out of style in 1981).

Visually, there are moments it delivers the goods- the repulsive gore, gruesome make-up effects. I liked how it tried to expand on the mythology; its vision of hell and the Gods, creatures that live there but the film is messy. As a horror piece- it is inconsistent, at times too cheesy, nonsensical and, as mentioned previously, not at all scary. Bradley's Pin-head is effective but has very little screen time and the climactic showdown is actually anti-climactic. The praise this film has received from the fans may be explained by simple nostalgia; aside from some choice moments, there is more to criticize here than to praise. Considering some of its ideas, this could have been much better. It is light years superior to the sequel that followed it, ""Hell on Earth"" and fans of the genre should see this, if you haven't already, but count me as one of the disappointed. I thought hell would have been far more horrifying than what was presented here. The film is colorful and hallucinatory but exhausting and rarely does it answer its own questions.

614171,3,6303265774,"Hell is a nasty place, and we see that more in this sequel, which is easily the nastiest, cruelest and most disturbing of the entire series.

 Kirsty, from part one, is now in a mental institution following the events that led to her family's death, but boy did she land in the wrong place! The head doctor Chanard has a morbid curiosity for the darkside and has studied the box for years. When he hears her tale he sees his chance to make dark dreams come true, and ends up resurrecting Julia through a graphic, horrifying scene. The other key player is a young girl who nevers speaks, Tiffany, who may be troubled enough to be locked up but is a whiz at puzzles. The Dr., always the sly one, uses Tiffany to open the box and views whats going on through his window glass. But the cenobites are anything but stupid, and everybody - Kirsty, Tiffany, Julia, Chanard - are brought into the Leviathan configuration itself.

 The first half deal with a semi-okay buildup. In the hospital Kirsty receives a message from her father saying, I am in hell - help me. So she's trying to figure out a way to save him. Listening to her story is a doctor who hasn't had much experience and doesn't know her true nature. We get to see a live brain surgery and the ressurection of Julia through an unforrunite mental patient who thinks he has bugs all over him (a scene I hated).

 The second part, in the Leviathan, is much better. Long hallways, mysterious doors, and all sorts of nasty surprises await. Kirsty is the main character and battles not only the demons, but Julia and the now-turned-evil doctor.

 One good thing is the cenobites are seen more often and are still as dark and delightful as the original. They even have a more human side at the end that makes sense and creates a good wrap up. These scenes that focus on them are the highlights. Their dialogue is still tasteful, the directing when focused on them is clever, with hooks coming out of nowhere, and the camera spinning when focusing on their heads. Their personality made more sense. They were allowing Kirsty and Tiffany to explore as they knew they didn't actually open the box but pretty soon they become impatient and want to ""play.""

 The ending with the doctor pissed me off. He was goofy and ridiculous and the way the cenobites and his fight went down was a let down. He was weakness in the film in many ways -- his obsession with the box was interesting and he obviously was off his rocker but why everyone gets so captivated with Julia I'll never know. His metamorphis was unpleasant to say the least, and when he ""rose"" he sported off silly one liners that would make Freddy cringe, and killed in rather silly and off-the-wall measures.

 In some ways the film improved upon its predecessor and in some ways it absorbed more fault. There were many plot inconsistencies. Why would the police reliquish the mattress to the doctor? How could Kirsty's father ( or the man she thinks is her father ) have had the ability to appear to her? Why did Julia get such a high recognition in Hell? Why did the leviathan (Lord or the Labyrith) have the doc be so powerful when battling the cenobites? How did Julia come out of her skin with makeup on? And on and on we go.

 Clive Barker's directing is as good as in the first and this one is full of even more special effects and a more unique setting. Christopher Young again does the score but it's even more stunning than the first, particularly at the intro. The acting is better; Julia is more pronounced as the darker role, Kirsty has had experience under her belt from doing the first and comes on the set more confident, and the Dr. (although I hadn't seen him in other roles) acts superb.

 As in the rest of the series this one is not mainstream and not for the kiddies (Well, except part three, which completely changed where the series was heading.) Perfect duo with part one; it's hard not to watch them together. If you hated the first you may not be keen on giving this one a chance, but if a fan of the original you should watch this ASAP as many fans feel it was better than part one.",1379635200,,4112,4.43368700265252

The only negatives I saw was the jumpy campy graphic movement of the Mad Doctor Cenobites Arm weapons.
Also I loved Chatterer. Besides Pinhead I like him as the second best cenobite on the 9 films despite the fact he never spoke because he just looked so epic. So I was Mad that they killed off his character (a fake wannabe shows up in the Awful Hellworld (movie 8) but he is different and I believe it listed the official name for that cenobite as ""melted face cenobite""

614235,3,6303265774,"Whats wrong with me? Why do I continue to watch these sequels when I know damn well they are nowhere near as good as the original? I guess its because compared to a lot of the other sequels out there they hold up better than they should do to lack of effort of the rest of the moviemaking world. I think its probably the visuals that redeem this particular effort. And I don't put effort in quotes because its obvious that for this time period the crew turned out a pretty good movie. Just not one that is up to par with the original. If perhaps Clive Barker wrote and directed this one it would have been, but the original ended on a note that I feel needed no further explanation. You can basically make up alternate stories in your head of other people happening onto the box, or seeking it out like Frank Cotton. But instead here we have taken a turn for the cheese. Stone walls in hell apparently are painted sheets of paper glued to plywood walls. They rewrite the rules a bit. Like Julia gets her skin back just as it was whilst Frank needed to steel someone elses skin in the original. Note: when you throw a sheet on a candle in hell, it makes the room explode into a napalm burst. The result of which your skin will be burnt off leaving your somehow juicy wet muscle exposed. Oh and it will ignore your clothing. This movie really ruins the feel of the first and unless your like me and feel the need to expose yourself to countless crappy sequels I'd stick to the original movie. Hell, Clive Barker is only tied to this as producer that should say enough. The way this series could have prospered is if the sequels were told through a Tales from the Crypt style. No I don't mean some cenobite host, but rather a series of stories revolving around the box. Sometimes the cenobites show up at the end, sometimes its just a story related to the box. Ya dig? Pretty sweet right? what am I doing writing a review? somebody fund me and I'll make it happen. The sequel that comes closest to what I'm talking about is Hellraiser: Inferno. Watch that one to see the only really worthy sequel. Again the second movie has its merits, like some great visuals. But its ruined by other factors.

""Hellbound: Hellraiser II,"" is a true expansion of the first film, & is actually gorier than the it's predecessor. It also has one of the most memorably disturbing scenes in horror! A deeply scarred schizophrenic man is used as bait by his doctor to draw Julia out of the bed he's sitting on, back from the dead. He see's maggots crawling all over his wounds, all over his body. He yell's, ""Get them off me,"" several times, & the doctor who wants to bring Julia back to life gives him a strait razor. What happens next is a hard watch for many indeed, as the man slices & slides the razor repeatedly across his body, in close up, digging & slicing the maggots out of his skin! He bleeds all over the bed that Julia is imprisoned in, & in a fantastically brutal scene, she comes back to life crawling out from inside the bed, grasping at the bleeding man. The man crawling away for his life in a bloody trail of mayhem, with Julia gradually crawling on top of him. A real life & death struggle, filmed unflinchingly, as the man finally succumbs to Julia. The accompanying soundtrack, further adds to this genuinely mesmerizing scene of survival at it's most feral level of predator & prey.

Yes, the first half of ""Hellbound: Helleraiser II,"" matches the intensity, the morbidity, the unflinching sharp straight edged horror of the first film. Gloom & doom, by the dreadful bloody buckets full, done in a very intelligent manner of methodical madness! Then the second half begins as Julia & the Doctor finally open up the portal of hell through the hands of a young girl, who solves the puzzle of the ""Lament Configuration Cube."" Therefore releasing ""Pinhead"" & his minions onto the world again, & opening hell to those who would venture in, & here is where the film starts to fall a part in it's over ambition. It becomes fragmented, loses it's singular objective, by trying to throw everything it can at the viewer. It fails admirably though, trying to bring the world of Hell & the Cenobites to the screen. Just not enough time here for a task so large, & hell it's self, is really overshadowed by the Hell that was the first half of the film. It was for a lack of a better word, anticlimactic.

In the long run, the second half, though inferior to the first, is worth the watch for the first half alone. This is a film for the serious horror lover, who can appreciate the baser side of the human condition, & all it's horrors, if not embrace it.

614329,3,6303265774,"Hellbound: Hellraiser II (Tony Randel, 1988)

I went to a rather excellent show tonight, and behind a few of the performers, the venue showed portions of Hellbound as a backdrop. I hadn't seen it since it came out; I saw both 2 and 3 in the theater, and I have since spent my time thinking that the first three Hellraiser movies were the ""good"" ones, and everything after that was terrible. Intrigued by the images, when I got home, I dialed up Hellbound to see if it held up after all these years. The short answer: no. Hellbound is far more in line with the rest of Tony Randel's awful output (Ticks, Amityville 1992, et al.) than I thought it was.

Plot: Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence, reprising her role from the original film), following the events of Hellraiser, is institutionalized. Of course, no one believes her... or so she thinks. Turns out the head of the facility, Dr. Channard (Hot Fuzz' Kenneth Cranham), is obsessed with the puzzle box, and not only that, but he's managed to procure the blood-soaked mattress on which Julia (Clare Higgins, also reprising her role) died... and proceeds to bring her back in the same way Julia resurrected Frank. Meanwhile, he has puzzle-obsessed inmate Tiffany (Dreamchild beauty Imogen Boorman, in her second and last feature appearance, she would continue working in television until 1993, then faded into obscurity) honing her skills until she's ready to open the infamous box and introduce him to the cenobites...

NOTE: the rest of this review can be considered to contain major spoilers for the film. If you have not seen it yet and are planning to, read no further and instead just know that I am not recommending it, for the most part, unless you're an obsessive fan of the original who wants to know what happens next.

On the upside, the movie is chock-full of arresting images; no one who's ever seen it will forget their first glimpse of Leviathan, or the revealed human form of the teeth-chattering cenobite. On the downside, Randel's direction coupled with Robin Vidgeon's cinematography makes the film look as if it were shot deep underwater, with the murk factor painfully high at times. (And that vignette where Spencer confronts Pinhead? My god, people, what were you thinking?) The acting, even by experienced folks like Higgins and Cranham, is often atrocious, and as has been pointed out by more than one critic, the Channard cenobite is the exact sort of bad-guy stereotype that Barker was trying to avoid by creating Pinhead--floating around spouting stupid one-liners like some sort of antigravity-enabled Freddy Krueger circa Dream Warriors.

If you can get past all the bad--and I do suggest doing so at least once if you're even a casual fan of the first film--it's worth watching once simply because despite all of the movie's flaws, both major and minor, Randel did manage to do some very interesting things with the mythology (thanks in no small part to Barker having a decent hand in the writing of the film). On the other hand, it's not worth watching more than that, and in fact, I can tell you from personal experience that coming back to it again twenty-five years later was quite a mistake. ** ",1358899200,,3182,4.818681318681318

The Tiffany character... Sorry, but I HATE characters like this.  It's never plausibly explained why she couldn't speak (or at least didn't for much of the movie); and, worse, she never really seemed frightened or confused by anything she experienced.  Just seemed totally unrealistic to me.

Kirsty... Terrible, TERRIBLE, actress...probably the worst out of everyone in the entire film; and yet, she's our protagonist.  This is where the visuals came in handy.  One could concentrate on the awesome effects rather than the horrific acting.

614396,3,6303265774,"HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER 2 is one of those sequels I like most as it picks up the narrative of the previous movie, and continues on. Unrelated sequels always leave me feeling less invested as I'm dealing with a whole new set of characters and oftentimes an entirely different situation (see LEPRECHAUN). But HELLBOUND did it right by opening with a very brief recap of the last few moments of the previous film then picking up there.

In this case ""there"" is with Kirsty Cotton having been brought to a mental institution in the wake of her father's death and the destruction that ensued in his house. Kirsty unravels a tale for the police and her doctor, Dr. Channard, about demons and puzzles and her uncle Frank returning from the dead. The police scoff, of course, and Dr. Channard gives her the ""hmm, that's very interesting,"" face. But Dr. Channard knows more than he's letting on and he has the blood-soaked mattress from the Cotton home, the one Julia had been chained to at the end of HELLRAISER, brought to his own house where he brings a mental patient from the institute over and lets the man kill himself, spilling tons of blood and allowing the hellbound Julia to return from that realm.

With the good doctor's help, Julia drains the blood of half a dozen victims before agreeing to then help Dr. Channard with his quest: opening the box and enjoying all the pleasures of Hell. To this end, he brings in Tiffany, a ""semi-catatonic"" girl with a penchant for puzzles, to help him open the doorway.

Unbeknownst to Dr. Channard, however, an intern, Dr. Kyle MacRae had snuck into his house and witnessed Julia's return. Kyle broke Kirsty out of the institute and together they returned to Channard's house where Kirsty hopes to use one of the many puzzle boxes the doctor has on display to get back into Hell and free her father.

Channard's plan goes off without a hitch except that once they get into Hell and Julia takes him to meet her god, a giant floating ""lozenge-shaped"" object she calls Leviathan, a doublecross is revealed and Julia, that harridan, gives Channard over to become a Cenobite.

Kirsty, meanwhile, is searching Hell for her father, with Tiffany in tow so that when they get out she can close the box. Instead of her father, however, Kirsty runs into Uncle Frank, then Julia, before she and Tiffany flee again into the maze of Hell. But just when they think they've escaped they realize Hell has begun leaking over into their world and the Dr. Channard cenobite is coming for them.

Kirsty finds allies in a strange place thanks to her own kleptomaniacal tendencies and her quick thinking and in the end ""Pinhead"" and his soldiers make a very brief but ineffective stand against their new enemy.

As sequels go, HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER 2 is a success. But as a movie in an of itself . . . well, let's just say it's a pretty good sequel and leave it at that.

There are questions from the first movie that go unaddressed in the sequel, questions I'd hope would be answered--like what was with the derelict and why did he turn into a giant dragon-skeleton at the end--plus there's the matter of the transition from one to the next. See, at the end of HELLRAISER Kirsty and her dorky boyfriend toss the box into the fire, but at the beginning of the next movie, Kirsty is in the hospital and her boyfriend has already talked to the police and been let go, never to be seen again. So, how did they get from the fire to the hospital, what meltdown, what arrest, what voluntary surrender did we miss?

And for me the biggest question I had going from one movie to the next was where the hell are we? In HELLRAISER, American Larry Cotton tells his very British wife Julia she should be happy to be back on her ""old stomping grounds"", which we assume means London. And while the weather seemed to bear this out, Julia seemed to be about the only Brit who came to the Cotton house. But I figured well, Larry knows a lot of Americans living abroad. However in HELLBOUND, the cop who talks to Kirsty is American. Kyle MacRae is American. Tiffany (played by an English actress) speaks with an American accent. Only Dr. Channard, Julia, and the lead cenobite have British accents (is this a subtle hint that Americans are good and trustworthy while Brits just want to send you to Hell? Well, we did relieve them of their colonies; may some wounds just never heal). The movie was filmed in England, but that doesn't mean anything. So I'm left confused as to just where of this is supposed to be taking place because I thought I had a grasp on it from HELLRAISER, but HELLBOUND makes me think otherwise. In the end it may seem like a small detail and one viewers might not have picked up on a year later.

HELLRAISER was written and directed by Clive Barker, author of the original novella ""The Hellbound Heart"", but for the sequel he's handed scripting duties over to Peter Atkins while Tony Randel directs. Randel, who worked as editor on HELLRAISER, would make little name for himself as a director while Atkins would drive the HELLRAISER franchise even further into the ground with HELLRAISER 3, but in 1988 I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were really trying their best. Like I said, as a sequel, HELLBOUND succeeds where most part 2's fail. It continues the original story, even builds on it to add more layers to the mythology, and opens up so many interesting possibilities for future stories. But as a separate entity, there are problems galore with this production.

Ashley Laurence's acting hasn't improved much from one movie to the next--in fact, a lot of her reactions seem a bit over the top like when Kyle is taking her out of the hospital and tells her to get dressed. She goes to the closet in her room but finds her clothes are gone and responds with a pretty harsh ""SHT!"" Jeez, calm down, I highly doubt some missing acid washed jeans merit the overkill, but she said it like she'd just found out her winning lottery ticket was in fact off by one number. And for the most part, this is how Laurence made her way through the movie. I know she is the human face of this franchise, that no matter how many sequels with how many different lead actresses, Ashley Laurence's Kirsty Cotton is the Nancy Thompson of the Hellraiser universe. But being the poster child doesn't excuse bad acting.

And once again we have to mention the effects. HELLBOUND obviously had a bigger budget, and I wish to God that meant the effects would have been better, but I detected in the Channard cenobite, in 19frigging88, was that . . . CLAYMATION??? I think it was. And stop-motion claymation in 1988 horror movie is not a good thing for anyone involved. It didn't work in EVIL DEAD and it's not going to work in HELLBOUND. I don't care what your budgetary constraints are, do not use claymation.

I felt the pace could have been picked up just a bit as well. At 94 minutes, it's nearly 50 minutes in before the cenobites make their first appearance, and isn't that really what we came to see?

There's mood and atmosphere to spare in HELLBOUND, and that's good; the production definitely has its own unique look, not just sticking to that of the original, but building on it and going even darker. Although the script is weak, the plot is strong.

I don't think HELLBOUND: HELLRAISER 2 is ever going to be a strong movie on its own, no one watching it is going to say wow that was awesome, but I think if seen immediately after the first movie, the focus may be more on the overall narrative arc, which pays off in the end here, I think.

So what have we learned? Despite many flaws that weaken the movie as it is, HELLBOUND stands up to many other sequels by virtue of its close ties to the source material, and, much like the Wonder Twins, when paired with HELLRAISER, it's a much stronger movie. If only the ones to follow had stuck to this formula...",1343779200,,7892,4.539381153305204

After escaping her perverted Uncle Frank and the Cenobites, Kirsty wakes up in the 'Channard Institute' for the insane. No one believes her crazy story except Dr Channard, who is fascinated with the box and the labyrinth beyond. Channard gets the mattress Julia died on, resurrects her with the blood of a mental patient, and with the help of a young mute patient (who is good with puzzles) opens the gateway. Kirsty, convinced that her father is in hell enters the gateway in search for him but Kirsty's pants browning nightmares have only just begun.

Is it any good?

In my opinion the best in the franchise, like an 'Alice in Wonderland' on bad acid. We see more of Pinhead's backstory as well as the box, fast paced action, great special effects and a grim vision of Hell, with it's dark creative underworld maze. Kenneth Cranham is charismatic as Dr Channard but also extremely evil at the same time. Ashley Laurence is such a strong heroine alongside the Tiffany character and the gore comes thick and fast.

I won't give the rest away but there is some great cinematography which I felt had been improved upon, and it is somewhat slow in the beginning but anyway it is easy to follow and it is not at all dull even if it does seem slow at times, in fact I dozed off at some point and had to go back and watch again, unusual because of the way it moves at such a fast pace once it gets going.

614403,1,6303265774,"I originally ordered the two midnight madness blurays of both Hellraisers, but luckily I was able to cancel the first and get the now OOP Anchorbay version.  I'm not really going to review the actual movie here (I definitely prefer the original, but I think the second will require more viewings to appreciate), but will focus solely on the midnight madness bluray of Hellraiser II (the one star is for the bluray).

Anyways, I came home and first watched the Anchorbay version of the original Hellraiser, the quality was better than the DVD, I first saw and while not pristine, it was an improvement (everyone should buy that while they still can over this company's version).  Last night I put this bluray on and was instantly disappointed, for the first 15-20 minutes the video is just plain bad, I'd describe it as somewhere between a VHS and a first generation DVD-5, after that the video improves a bunch but even then its not much more than a glorified DVD (if even that) and the picture remains subpar and at poor DVD level quality.

As for the sound, I don't see what everyone here is so happy about, I found the sound maddeningly disappointing.  Sure parts sounded great, but the volume was so out of control I was just pissed (not sure if the original movie was this way).  Parts of the movie were so quite I could barely hear what was being said, so I'd turn up my volume only to have the next scene blaring at a far too loud level so the entire movie was spend adjusting my volume.

In final, I'll never order another bluray from this company without first previewing it or reading the reviews.

614405,2,6303265774,"First of all let me say this review is of the blu-ray itself and not the movie. The movie Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 is a 5 star movie....one of my favorite horror films of all time actually. Image Entertainment really put no effort into this release at all. No extras at all except a very grainy trailer. The picture quality alternates between very grainy and muddy to almost quite nice..literally the entire movie. Certain dark scenes are very bad and then other dark scenes are almost HD showcase quality. Light scenes tended to look better then oddly became grainy and muddy but still watchable. Skin tones also seem more red than they should be.

I know that this is a 20 year old movie but with blu-rays it's kind of expected that a remastered HD transfer is in order(...or else why upgrade?) and i understand this isn't Star Wars, so millions of dollars aren't going to be spent on the remastering process but i would have expected a better end result from Image.

I could actually forgive the image quality because i love this movie so much. What i can't comprehend is the lack of extras. The 20th anniversary DVD from Anchor Bay, which i also have, has audio commentary, interviews and tons of behind the scene footage. Even plenty of new interviews with the cast and crew. Image Entertainment saw fit to include NONE of that.

Sound quality is very good though. For the source material Hellbound sounds better than it ever has. Dialogue is clean and loud scenes will give your subwoofer a slight workout. Being a Hellraiser fan and owning all of the movies on DVD. Even Hellraiser: Hellworld..not something i'm proud of:-) i can say that i am happy to have this on blu-ray and being a sucker for anything Hellraiser related...if Image Entertainment decides to get their act together,i would buy a Hellraiser:Hellbound special edition again on blu-ray with a better HD transfer and extras.

If you haven't bought this yet. RENT IT and buy Anchor Bay's 20th Anniversary DVD. Most Blu-ray players upconvert DVD's anyway and the picture quality sadly will be the same as this blu-ray.

It appears that the upcoming Blu-ray release is also the unrated version; however, only time will tell if the transfer is at least suitable.

If you are new to the series and relatively unfamiliar with the characters, ""Hellraiser"" and ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" are MUST-SEES above the other films (two or three of them being direct-to-video releases). Pinhead is at his best in the first two films, and his accompanying cenobites are the most memorable as well.

and....Hellraiser 2 is one of those rare sequels that is just as good as the original (not a easily done feat).

the story picks up right after the first film ends, so there is a continuity of plot.  Kirsty is now hospitalized in a psych unit, because she keeps trying to warn others about the Cenobites.  Her doctors think she is delusional.

Also some of the principal actors from the first film and here in the second one; ""Pinhead"" of course, and the other Cenobites.  Also here is the ""evil"" step-mother, played by Clare Higgins, who was in the first film.  I really enjoy watching Clare Higgins.

The first film had the Cenobites escaping Hell and entering our world, the earth.  Here in the second film Kirsty and her psychiatrist enter Hell.  Kirsty goes there because she wants to find her father, who was killed by the Cenobites in the first film.  Her doctor goes there because he is curious about the ""box"" and the magic and powers it produces. (He has done extensive research on the subject we find out).

** WARNING! SPOILER ALERT! **

In Clive Barker's vision of Hell, those who rule it do so a bit differently than we see in most of the cinema -- the ""Cenobites"" have ethics. Morals. Not the evil cackling and brain-dead chortling of most Hell-ish horror movies -- at least, not as much -- the movie eschews the banality of evil and gives us rulers of Hell who are not just subject to the occasional technicality: they are also subject to moral quandaries.

The subtle intelligence of this premise is easily lost among those buckets of blood I mentioned earlier, but there IS more to this movie than all the blood and guts that first meet the eye.

The film suffers from some seriously unrealistic reactions by characters who find themselves in Hell. Not truly predictable, has both original and interesting ideas, with some entirely predictable segments -- there is plenty hear to make you groan, and also plenty to enjoy.

With her is a new friend she made in the mental ward, Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), a mute with convenient puzzle-solving skills. Hot on her trail is her arch-nemesis and step mother, Julia (Claire Higgins), who has seduced Kristy's doctor and turned him onto the wild side of life (read: Hellraising good times).

While the film lacks the vision and focus of the original, it's certainly a worthy successor with more than a few creepy elements at play. First and foremost, the visions of Hell are unique and unlike anything seen in film before it. Also, there's plenty of bloodshed and elaborate special effects and make-up work to go around, making this one almost as visually unsettling and disgusting as its predecessor. Director Tony Randel doesn't work the same sort of magic behind the camera as Barker (it doesn't help that the script is a bit bloated) but is more than up to the task of delivering an intense and visually striking follow-up. It's also worth noting that the film lets us in on a bit on the origins of the lead cenobite from the first film, Pinhead, as portrayed by Doug Bradley, in one of the film's most imaginative and intense sequences.

While it's certainly not a patch on the original, for what it's worth, ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" is miles above and beyond the myriad of sequels that would follow in its wake. Fans of the first will appreciate the fact that it attempts to take things one step further, and although it stumbles along the way, in the end, it's a gruesome and grueling experience that more than lives up to its name.",1282694400,,1902,5.132258064516129

This was not so much as bad 80s fashion updating tired zombie-wear, but an entirely new look and conception of what exactly the demons of hell are all about.  Gone were the picthfork-poking horned hobgoblins and fire-illuminated cave walls, traded for BDSM-looking, leather-clad, hell-science modified ministers of eternal torture--ultimate and enduring evil by way of the Borg meeting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B000OPPBEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>.  It was revolutionary and incredibly powerful, with Pinhead leading the way as the new face of modern horror.  Things were looking up for the genre.

And then it all went off the rails with this awful sequel, the first in an increasingly pathetic and lame series of just plain bad schlock-horror attempts.  The way was lost.

This movie's vast promise, and its so original horror images are completely compromised by a spirallingly nonsensical plot and lame effects.  The cenobites lose their dark luster as unquestioned and unquestioning minions of the Beast and become impotent, pathetic victims in a ridiculously one-sided hell-demon smackdown. Hell is unleashed on the world, but then it's all okay and things get all cleaned up.  By the end, it's almost like we're watching just another movie of the week, concluding with a trite and contrived setup for the next bad sequel.

The start of the film is promising, with a stark Euro design feel to the film, the interiors close and dimly lit, with the crimson of the blood, when it finally comes, as a powerful visual contrast.  But then we start the slowly mushrooming bog-down in getting Julia's body back together, with no understanding of why she's back, how she's back, etc.  The bloody chain-mattress is inspired, but its power is forgotten and lost.  Then we get the puzzle box, solved and opened, and hell creaks into our dimension once more, and the cenobites arrive.  And they're so talkative now (not Butterball or Chatterer, though), engaging in polite debate with the idiotic Kirstie, with lame dialog about ""knowing your flesh.""  I mean, they're the demons of hell, and they're somehow bound by the esoteric strictures of formal rhetoric?  There appear to be some kind of rules, but no one says what they are, or how they work, or who pays attention to whether they're followed or not.  What exactly is the meaning of a red card in hell?

And we descend into the labyrinth, with its idiotic representations of the damned.  There are laughing clown graphics, like something out of a late-stage Night Gallery rerun.  A guy juggles eyeballs into blood-filled palms, which to me looked like something out of a bad Billy Idol video.  There are naked women under sheer cloth, with and without blood, root-encrusted dark passageways, jingling chains, etc.  It's just so cheezy, so weak, so low-budge and ultimately it just doesn't make any sense.  The evil doctor is betrayed by Julia--duh--and then he comes back as the baddest of the bad cenobites.  Wait a minute--this newbie, this cenobite rookie--all of a sudden is more powerful than the demons who have been there for decades, even centuries?  How, and why?  Then a gigantic maggot-head-tail-thingy with some kind of spinning brain gurgler zaps the doctor, and he floats around at the end of this thing--what the in the hell is that, and what's at the opposite end?  Then the ultra-cheeziest of the effects come, with the Ray Harryhausen stop-motion claymation effects of the doctor's evil, evil hands/tentacles.  It's just plain bad.

In the end, the girls get out, hell seals up, the beast is put back (safely) into hell, the doctor gets his, Julia gets hers, etc.  The epilogue is the evil doctor's house being packed out, and one of the movers just happens to stumble upon the bloody mattress.  No, wait: the still-wet bloody mattress, in a room and house filled with boxes; the packers have already been there, and we have to figure the authorities have done whatever they're going to do, and all of them just, like, didn't notice or chose to leave this undeniable thing in the middle of the room? ""Uh, we're going to pack up now.  We'll just leave this bloodstained suicide/homicide mattress alone, m'kay?""  It's just absolutely, unforgivably stupid, a hollow and contrived ending to set up the next bad sequel.

Bottom line: See it for the cenobites, and for the early mattress scene.  Watch it once, so you can say you've seen it.

614542,4,6303265774,"I like Doug Bradley, and I like the strange place the idea for this series of movies came from. There are certain very memorable lines in this movie; a doctor obsessed with the occult finds himself in Clive Barker's Hell, horribly disfigured, and looks about the twisted, grim landscape with something like eagerness and says, ""to think I hesitated"" [to come to Hell]. There's also a self-mutilation scene which is absolutely horrible, and therefore really great.",1244332800,,463,5.105263157894737
614543,3,6303265774,"After Clive Barker's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser/dp/6305972001/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser</a>&nbsp;made a substantial amount of money at the box office and introduced a new horror icon in the form of Pinhead, a sequel was inevitable. The sequel, which is only executive produced by Barker, boasts increased production values, more blood, and more Pinhead. Unfortunately, it also has a weak plot and an embarrassing new cenobite.

The film opens with a quick recap of how #1 ended, before we see (briefly) how Pinhead came to be his nail-studded form. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) from the first film is now in a psychiatric hospital after the carnage is discovered at her father's home. Kirsty tells the police and staff what happened, but not believes her of course. Soon, however, the malevolent Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham) who runs the hospital has succeeded in resurrecting Kirsty's step-mother Julia (Clare Higgins), who (like Frank from the first film) has no skin. Also along for the ride this time is Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), a patient at the hospital with a talent for solving puzzles. And, of course, Pinhead and his fellow cenobites have much more screen time.

Pinhead's entrance is so grandiose; it's almost comical...But, a worthy (second) introduction to the character.

Now, the makeup effects are much more gruesome this time around. Julie does look frightfully grotesque. I advise you not to eat while watching this movie. Seeing her does make one's stomach churn. Although, it's worth noting that nothing about this movie is disturbing, but much of it is disgusting.

There is some pretty good imagery in this film though and the set/art direction is certainly more finely crafted. Some of the visual effects are, however, incredibly 80s and as such have not aged very well.

As for the character's, Channard is a caricature. He has a foreboding voice and is instantly untrustworthy. When he appears in cenobite form, I shook my head a little. He looks like a cross between a Power Rangers villain and a creature from Beetlejuice.

With that said, I still find the cenobites to be some of the more unique creations to emerge from 80s horror. The fact that their whole existence is shrouded in mystery makes them all the more fascinating...And what makes it so disappointing that they had to dig deeper into the Pinhead character. He was such a menacing presence in the first film; I think the decision to expose his humanity wasn't very wise. It doesn't bring much depth to the character and succeeds only at making him less frightening and therefore less effective.

Overall, it's the plot that breaks this film. While the direction by Barker prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Tony Randel is even-handed, Peter Atkins' tedious, extraordinarily weak plot struggles to fill its 96-minute running time. While not a complete failure it doesn't succeed as a sequel or even on its own merit. Yes, parts will satisfy the gore-starved horror fan of America and much of it looks pretty cool but all-in-all it's pretty inferior to its much better predecessor.

GRADE: C",1240272000,3,3137,5.26
614544,3,6303265774,"This is one of those rare occaisions where a sequel actually holds up to the original, and where it can't be a hit every time, understood, too many times the sequels only cash in on the original's success.

Where the first installment in this series tells a story, with some very dark visuals, this one focuses, and relies heavily on nightmarish imagery. Yes, there is a story, and it picks up right where the first one left off, but this installment seems to want mostly to throw a whole lot of bizarre and scary images at you. I have stated elsewhere, I don't enjoy gore for gore's sake, but where it's warranted, why not do it right? There is a segment early on, which is SO horrible to watch, so controversial, so gratuitous, I get uneasy when it's on. This, of course, is the mental patient who is wearing the straight-jacket. The intent, obviously, is to upset and unbalance the viewer, and it does so, in spades. You gotta feel for this guy, even knowing it's just a movie.

A large part of the film takes place in another realm, and it flows like a fantasy film, which is, in its own way, what it is. This takes the edge off, because this, and the first installment, have some intense graphic violence. There is something in people, they have a morbid fascination with seeing pain and suffering. And where films like this aren't mainstream, they have a very loyal following nonetheless.

An enjoyable feature, for me, anyway, is the extras. There is a plethora of interviews with the people involved in the making; the director of this, and the first one, some of the actors, and various people who made it what it is. But, to its detriment, this takes the covers off, and the movie no longer has its aura of mystery. One of the fun things about watching a weird movie, is thinking, ""...how did they do that?..."" Of course, it's nice to have the answer at your disposal, but looking behind the curtain, it's often disappointing to see the little, unassuming man pulling the levers.

The first two are the only ones in this series I bother with, as I saw and didn't like the third, or fourth. I have seen little clips of the others, and as can be expected, they drove it into the ground.

There are a few minor continuity issues between this installment and the first, but it does follow the first fairly smoothly nonetheless. Not seamlessly, but pretty close.

Again, not a bad sequel per se.

A brilliant and macabre sequel to the 1987 classic horror-fantasy from Clive Barker! Tony Randall whom made his debut of directing does a fantastic job and Clive Barker who is the creator of ""Hellraiser"" serves as excutive producer. Here is a sequel that delivers the goods in terms of atmosphere, story and graphic torture and gore sequences! in fact the film is so gory that it nearly got an ""X"" rating but got an R as it was cut then later finally uncut with all the graphic footage on video in 1989 in a unrated version. The film offers plot twists and really cool creatures with nice effects for it's time especially the origin of everyone's favorite nail-headed demon Pinhead, the music score by Christopher Young is chilling as always and the film is a satisyfing follow-up to a masterpiece that delivers.

614591,4,6303265774,"I like horror movies.  Almost too much.  Let's not go into the reasons why.  There are too many.  And some of them aren't pretty.

But I also like plots, character development, and complexity.  After watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-first-Hellraiser/dp/6305972001/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the first Hellraiser</a>, I began to suspect that the series was created as an excuse to watch people get tortured with hooks.  If you're not aware of the basic mythology, it is this: there is a box (called the Lament Configuration -- but you only know this if you've read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-book/dp/0971024928/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the book</a>) that, when it is opened, unlocks the gateway to another dimension filled with grotesque creatures called Cenobites who's only purpose is to inflict an eternity of endless suffering and pain on the person who opened the box.

I began to wonder early on why on earth anyone anywhere would ever create such a box, let alone open it.  See,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/all/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">all</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/of/dp/B000CRR31U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">of</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the/dp/B000LC3ID8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B00105303S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/movies/dp/B001AV9CHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">movies</a>&nbsp;operate on the same basic principle -- ""Let's kill a bunch of people in graphic and horrifying ways!"" -- but the deaths are (at least partially) connected to a larger theme: cherish your life.  The Hellraiser films are like the exact opposite.  They function as visual sadomasochism, inviting you to cherish death.  Or not even death, because the victims of the Cenobites never really die.

It's complicated, and I'm going somewhere with this.  HELLBOUND picks up right where the first film left off.  It even offers you a completely nonsensical recap at the beginning.  This turns out to be unnecessary, because young Kirsty from the first film now finds herself in a mental institution, and she kindly spells out every little detail of the first film to her creepy psychiatrist, Dr. Channard.  Channard, who is a closet Hellraiser junkie, is intrigued by her story and sets in motion events that will open for him the gates to the Cenobite world.

Why on earth?  Why would someone do that?  Is he mad?  Yes, he is.  But he is more than that.

When Channard finally visits the ""fourth dimension"" and sees it for what it is, he is horrified.  Naturally.  But then he begins to understand, and the nature of that world is made painfully clear.  Why do I like horror movies?  Why do insane psychiatrists insist on opening the gates to hell?  It's really the same question.

This sequel succeeds in ways that the first could only dream of.  Barker's sadomasochistic universe is lovingly realized, and captures not just the essence of Barker's twisted brain, but also the twisted essence of why horror movies exist to begin with.  Whether you like a little spank with your sex, or enjoy the ""burn"" of an extra hard workout at the gym, or simply can't look away when you pass a particularly nasty car accident on the street, the basic point is that pain is almost never without pleasure.  Pain releases endorphins, it fine tunes the mind, and Barker is fiddling with that visceral clarity that comes from watching something horrible happen to someone else.  Horror movies, after all, are the result of a little sadomasochism in all of us, and HELLBOUND takes that point and expands on it until you have an entire universe built on the pleasurably painful line separating life and death.

It's not an easy movie to watch in many respects (and not just because both Ashley Laurence and Kenneth Cranham are some of the worst actors I've ever seen), but it finally answers some niggling questions and becomes more than just an excuse to watch torture.  In fact, if you haven't seen the first film, I suggest you skip it and start with this one.  If you like horror movies, you've got no excuse not to.",1227052800,2,4435,5.9730586370839935

614595,4,6303265774,"The blood, gore, ""the box"", and the cenobites continue. The movie picks up right were the first one ended. Kirsty made a deal with Pinhead, who is the leader of the cenobites, to give them Uncle Frank (he escaped them) in exchange for her. After they took Frank, the female cenobite goes after Kirsty until she is able to use the box to send them all back to Helll. Her father's home then gets destroyed....

Kirsty is now in a psychiatrist's hospital. Dr. Chinnard is fascinated with the mind, the brain, and the other dimension. He was able to take the bloody bed with the chains in it from Kirsty's house. He also has the box which summons the cenobites. Chinnard unknowingly helps Kristy's stepmother Julia to escape the cenobites as she comes out of the bloody bed the way Frank looked in the first Hellraiser (all blood, bones, muscle but no skin). Together the conspire to get Julia back her skin and in return, Julia would show Dr. Chinnard, the other ""place"" including her god, the lord of flesh and desire; Leviathan. But she has other plans for him as well.

Kristy is hell bent (sorry for the pun) on trying to get her father out of hell as she sees a message in blood in her hospital room. With help from Chinnard's assistant, Kristy is able to get out of the hospital as Chinnard's assistant, Kyle was able to see that Kristy was telling the truth about the box and the demons it caries. Kristy learns that Pinhead as well as his cenobites use to be human. She finds a picture in Chinnard's house of Capt. Elliot Spencer (played by Doug Bradely) and belives it is Pinhead himself. Earily, one of the cenobites is a little child (I'm not going to give up the whole plot). Kristy, even though she didn't open the box, runs into her old ""friends,"" the cenobites, who let her explore as Kristy and a mute girl who loves to solve puzzles are being chased by another demon (not going to give it away) with alternate plans. Pinhead is looking to ""play"" with Kirsty and get to know her flesh. He also stops his troops from killing her mute friend as Pinhead says,"" It is not curious hands that summon us, it's desire."" As he points to Chinnard's secret room because Chinnard was using the mute girl as a gineau pig. This leads to the ultimate showdown between Pinhead and his troops against the other demon. Will Julia be able to do what Frank couldn't? Escape!

Julia had a great couple of lines when she faces off with Kirsty. ""Come on Snow White! Take your best shot!"" Who would of thought you would hear the words, Snow White, in Hellraiser (Hellraiser 2 to be exact)!

I thought Hellraiser was slightly weaker than the first one, third one (Hell on Earth) and the fourth one (Bloodlines). I was a little disappointed towards the end (not going to give it away). Don't get me wrong, it's still one of the best horror movies back in the time when horror movies relied more on acting than on special effects/CGI. Pinhead once again shines as the angel/demon of mercy looking to explore peoples flesh and desires while taking their souls. The way to dial his number is by solving the ""box"" which is known as the Lament Configuration. The boxes history is explained in more detail in Hellraiser: Bloodlines.

I would give this movie a 4.5 but still a great addition to your horror collection. The picture is great and no extras that would make you go, WOW!",1209081600,,3362,4.504918032786885

Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is now in an insane asylum after her involvement with the Cenobites in the first Hellraiser movie.  There's evil afoot in the asylum, in the form of Doctor Philip Channard (Kenneth Cranham).  Instead of throwing away the mattress Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins) died on, Dr. Channard brings it to his home along with a mental patient, for the sole purpose of spilling fresh blood onto it.  The fresh blood brings Julia back from hell, and she's thirsty for more.  ""All we need now ... is skin.""

Meanwhile, Kirsty is receiving messages from her father, written in blood on her walls, telling her he's trapped in hell.  Together with an autistic puzzle-solver named Tiffany (Imogen Boorman) Kirsty uses the Lemarchand's Box to enter hell, trying to save her father.  But Tiffany has been used by Dr. Channard, and the good doctor finds his own hell.

While the movie focuses on Kirsty, Tiffany, and Dr. Channard's trials and travails in hell, it in no sense of the way becomes boring.  The doctor wins over Pinhead in sheer grotesquerie, traveling through hell from a large gooey worm attached to his head and snakes with different talents extending from his palms.  Julia shines as the evil temptress she is, unveiled in her hellish realm.  At the center of hell is a diamond shape oracle, emitting a hellish negative-light that is fantastically frightening.  Kirsty reveals insight into Pinhead, and Pinhead faces off with the good doctor.

614652,1,6303265774,"This is the first time I delved into the HellRaiser series, and I have to admit, I kind of regret it. The film opens with a collage of disturbing images, I guess to get my attention, but there is no real reason for them to be there. From there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next. It all looks perfectly twisted, but who really cares. Clive Barker, as he did in ""Night Breed,"" shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs. Of course they are all very self-indulgent, but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way. Had this film showed up at a modern art museum I would have labeled it pretentious. But since it showed up in movie theaters I have no choice but to label it crap.

I would love to describe the plot to you, but it didn't make a ton of sense to me. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is in a mental hospital and is convinced that her dad is calling out to her from inside hell, and thus she must go save him. Meanwhile her evil step-mom (and speaking from experience they are all evil) is reemerging from hell with the distinct disadvantage of not having any skin. Upon her return she uses her bloody pulp of a body to engage in a sexual act with another evil doer. I'm sure that gets laughs every time from the children who are watching, but to me it was silly and unnecessary. She goes on a quest for skin which goes off without a hitch, and from there a battle ensues between Kirsty and her step-mom over the soul of a little girl named Tiffany (or so everybody calls her). The whole point seems to be that our minds make up our own personal hells, and that is an idea I can get on board with. One overview shot of hell has it looking strikingly similar to an M.C. Escher print. With dead ends and trap doors and boogeymen we all travel through the labyrinth of our mind on a daily basis. But I cannot get on board with this film. It is sensational for the sake of sensationalism, which is fine with me, but not when it is mixed with a brain dead plot. What do I, or anybody for that matter, get from watching a man carve himself up with a knife? I guess that at least it is not soft like modern horror movies, but this one does not earn its gore.

For those of you who demand nothing out of your movies other than the experience of a bad dream where nothing makes sense then this is your film. For the rest of you this is failed storytelling of the highest degree. I still have ""HellRaiser"" on my shelf to watch and I must say it won't be hard for that one to top this mess. I may never understand why people think atmosphere is enough to create a scary movie. It is the major flaw of this film and Japanese Horror in general, but I want a story to go with my scares. What this one is selling is a chance to be grossed out of your mind or bored stiff. . .or both. I hated this movie, and no I don't care how realistic it looked when the characters were peeling the skin off of their faces. *1/2",1162684800,,2961,4.12998266897747

Kirsty becomes his latest patient at his psychiatric hospital, and after hearing of the events that took place in the first movie, Channard decides to reanimate the evil Julia. He agrees to bring her victims so she can continue regenerating, and in exchange she will be his guide in the labyrinth that is Hell.

Christopher Young's music is awesome. Loud, dramatic, and ominous - the movie's theme during the opening credits lets the viewers know what they're getting into. His music is also very significant during the scene when Tiffany solves the puzzle box. The music conveys Tiffany's childlike innocence and her sense of wonder as she handles and studies the box. The tone and speed of the music (as Tiffany manipulates the box) raises the tension to a fever pitch. Then, after a deafening silence, the movie's theme erupts as the gateway to Hell is unlocked, and the cenobites are once again freed to walk the Earth. Their spectacular entrance in this scene was even more impressive than in the first movie when they appeared after Kirsty solved the box. This scene is also when Pinhead delivers the most important line of Hellraiser II: ""It is not hands that call us - it is DESIRE."" But you need to hear Doug Bradley's delivery of that line for it to have any affect on you. That line may look laughable, but it is powerful and so significant because it speaks volumes about the nature of the cenobites. It seems the cenobites will not slaughter someone who solves the box UNLESS that person has a desire to see what happens when the box is solved - even if that person DOESN'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN when the box is solved. That would explain why they wanted to torture Kirsty in the first movie. And since Tiffany wanted to solve the box simply for the sake of solving the puzzle, she was spared. She had no idea anything would happen when she solved the box. That raises questions about the nature of the game - since the cenobites obviously knew it was Channard who called them, why didn't they go after him? Or did they think it was Kirsty who called them?

Channard has no qualms at all when he has people killed, and yet he is a timid man. It is clear that he expects Julia to protect him from whatever unknown terrors are lurking in Hell. Channard ultimately finds what he is looking for - and pays a painful price. There is a cenobite battle in Hellraiser II, which was disappointing because it was so one-sided. There is a reason for this though, and in case you don't get it when you watch the movie, it's explained on the audio commentary.

The DVD has an audio commentary by Ashley Laurence, director Tony Randel and writer Peter Atkins. Their commentary was very descriptive and informative. They gently poke fun at their mistakes, and this makes the commentary more enjoyable. Lord knows there were some glaring mistakes. But did anyone besides me notice the hostility that seems to exist between Randel and Atkins? The thought of them sharing a mutual dislike of each other and grudgingly doing this commentary together gives me perverse pleasure.

I LOVED this movie up until Kirsty's reunion with Frank. From that point on this movie goes to hell (in a manner of speaking). It would have been nice if the script had dropped the dumb subplot of Kirsty looking for her father - even if that left no reason for the Kirsty character to be in this movie. It's near the end of the movie when Pinhead delivers his infamous line ""Your suffering will be LEGENDARY - even in Hell."" But even Pinhead's wit can't uplift the last half hour of this movie. But it was pretty funny to see the patients tearing the hospital apart - and just how did they get their hands on all those puzzle boxes? A different actress plays the Female Cenobite in Hellraiser II - she is less menacing in this movie, but is still entertaining. I was glad to see that she still had the bloodlust that was so evident in the first movie. But I would have preferred it if she didn't sound so nonchalant when she was talking, and I missed the wide-eyed stare of the actress from the first movie. The Chatterer has a different face at one point in Hellraiser II, which confused me until I heard the audio commentary. Personally, I preferred the Chatterer's original face. It was a real surprise when the Chatterer's identity was revealed. Without giving away too much, it involves a shocking scene - the murder of a child. The ending of Hellraiser II made no sense whatsoever, but I'm guessing that the filmmakers wanted to wait until the sequel to explain what's going on in Hell. And yes, as of this writing I have only seen the first two movies in the Hellraiser series.

Hellraiser II also reveals Pinhead's background. Needless to say I was disappointed - I preferred to think of the cenobites as having Lovecraftian origins. I even dreamed up a whole history and mythology for the cenobites after seeing the first movie! But I loved the look of dread and despair on Pinhead's face (right before undergoing his `surgery') toward the end of the movie - you know that if someone like him is fearing for his own safety then he must be in serious danger. How the mighty have fallen. Buy the soundtrack and this DVD so that you can properly savour the first two-thirds of this movie.",1155168000,3,5535,4.609533468559838

The Cenobites have taken her father to the depths of hell and she must get him back. Of course, nobody believes her. But the gateway to the Cenobites' domain may be closer than she thinks. Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham) is the head doctor at the institution, who is immediately a suspicious mystery. As it turns out, he has been searching for the answer to the Lament Configuration -- the tool one must use to open Hell -- for all of his life. Between the horrific story of Kirsty and the puzzle-solving talents of mute patient Tiffany (Imogen Boorman), he plans to solve the configuration and finally see for himself the fantastic wonders and warped pleasures of Hell. But, as always, such a desire comes at a price. After resurrecting Julia (Clare Higgins) -- who also was taken by the Cenobites in the first film -- history repeats itself as his naive greed allows him to help Julia get whatever it is that she wants. What she wants is nothing he could ever wish upon his worst enemy. Regardless, the blood-lusting doctor submits himself to her plans and winds up in a world of pain. He himself is transformed into a gruesome Cenobite. But trouble comes-a-callin' when the original gang of Cenobites crash the party. Kirsty and Tiffany find themselves trapped in the middle of the chaos, unable to find their way out of the dizzying corridors of Hell. And when the leader of the Cenobites Pinhead (Doug Bradley) realizes who she is, Kirsty is in even deeper trouble. Luckily, Kirsty has learned from her experiences and has a few tricks up her sleeve, with the help of Tiffany. But even if they manage to escape the clutches of Pinhead and his group of flesh-ripping demons, can they overcome the power of the Laviathan, Lord of the Labrynth?

Hellbound: Hellraiser II is by all means a worthy sequel. A sequel that stayed true to its origin, and at the same time escaped the boundaries of it. The first movie was in every way classifiable as horror, bringing the audience into a terrifyingly unfamiliar yet enchanting world of misery and mystery. Hellbound, on the other hand, reaches beyond the limits of horror. And that's actually a good thing. I found that many of the scenes took on a more fantasy-like feel. An incredibly dark fantasy, that is. One thing that helped the story along was the way that the viewer got a much better glimpse into the world of Hell and the characters of the Cenobites. We even get to see Captain Elliot Spencer's transformation into Pinhead! Not to mention the birth of a new Cenobite -- Channard. The return of most of the original characters -- including Kirsty, Julia, and Frank -- was a good call, but any new characters with extra appeal always helps fill a sequel out, and Channard definitely did that. Coupled with the almost Elfman-like score, I also felt that the sense of a grim fantasy pulling through in the script and set appearance was a hauntingly beautiful touch. It goes deeper than just a few scares. It's almost an artistic approach. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of blood and shocking thrills to be found. But it's quite easy to see past that and appreciate Hellbound for what it truly is, and what most other sequels have come to lack: an engaging and moral-based story about greed, lust, and the darker side of human nature that is delivered in a thought-provoking yet completely entertaining way. If you liked Hellraiser, Hellbound: Hellraiser II is a must-see. Few sequels live up to the originals, and when they do it's a wonderful find.

614827,5,6303265774,"HELLRAISER is one of the greatest horror films to grace the screen, thanks to the presence of its director, Clive Barker, who also wrote the story it was based on, The Hellbound Heart. Thanks to its success, it established its evil nemesis, Pinhead, as a cult favorite. He along with his cohorts, the Cenobites, established themselves as the ultimate terror. You don't want to cross paths with these creeps.

HELLBOUND picks up where the last HELLRAISER left off, as Kirsty (once again the pretty Ashley Laurence) awakens in a mental hospital, where a detective explains that her boyfriend has been sent home, but that he has more questions for her about what went on in ""daddy's house"". However, Kirsty has little idea that her therapist, Dr. Channard (played on-the-mark by Kenneth Cranham), is about to unlock the gateway once again due to his unnerving obsession with the history of the puzzle box, and of the story that Kirsty has told him. He decides to try something, as he puts a patient on a bed with chains with a nasty blood stain (from the first movie, it was Julia's) and, to his shock, a rather skinless Julia (the delicious Claire Higgins) emerges and sucks the life out of the patient. She explains herself to some degree, and Dr. Channard agrees to help her (you will see the similarities between what happened with Frank in the first movie and with Julia in this one, but they end to a certain point). One of the patients in the hospital, a mute, is given a puzzle box and she unknowingly unlocks the gateway to hell, and so emerge the Cenobites with their fearless leader Pinhead (Doug Bradley, nuff said!). But Pinhead says they were not summoned by hands, but by desire, and so now they're after Dr. Channard. Julia is brought to life after a series of murders by her resurrect her back to normal human state. After such, she tricks Dr. Channard, who ultimately becomes a force to be reckoned with in hell. He becomes a Cenobite, but wants to run things his way, so he tries to massacre the Cenobites (yes, that includes you Pinhead) and briefly takes over things after the diabolical Julia devised a plan that, well, backfired on her. It's up to Kirsty to help her and the mute, Tiffany (played cleverly by Imogen Boorman) escape the clutches of the evil Dr. Channard. Once again, the ending leaves the  door wide open for the next chapter of HELLRAISER, titled HELL ON EARTH. After Julia is finally rid of, and Channard and cohorts are sent back to hell, someone else is going to find the puzzle box...and ultimately become the next hapless sap to open the gateway.

This sequel almost nearly matches its predecessor, and is one of the most satisfying sequels in recent years, although I've yet to see how SAW II matches its predecessor.

614830,3,6303265774,"After watching the masterpiece known as Hellraiser and seeing that the first sequel would continue where the original left off, I was expecting a little more than what the final product offered. I'm not a fan of sequels and this proved that I should keep sequels in the proper perspective - to squeeze more money from a proven formula.

The first half of the movie could have served as the beginning for the original - Kirsty going through flashbacks (some scenes are shown and others are not) of how her uncle Frank got caught up in his quest for the ultimate pleasure with the Cenobites, how her ""beloved"" stepmother Julia helped Frank along so she could have him and how her father wound up as the finishing touch to a killing spree that would bring Frank back to life and evoke the wrath of the Cenobites for having escaped them.

The mental hospital background had, by 1988, become quite predictable in horror movies (having been done in the form of a teen mental ward the year before in Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, to give just one example). And we find that Kirsty and Julia continue their long-standing loathing of each other as Kirsty attempts to stop her from coming back (by trying to have the mattress she died on destroyed before anything can happen) and by doing everything she can to destroy her once she does come back.  We also see that Frank continues the quest to seduce his own niece - to him, incest being the ultimate pleasure.

Pinhead and the Cenobites begin their downfall in this installment by having their ""human"" sides (and faces) exposed. Leave it up to Hollywood to completely destroy the credibility of a scarier than hell character. We are also introduced to a new monster here (thanks to Julia offering up Dr. Channard for sacrifice) who kills the Cenobites but you know he's not dead when, at the very end, he feeds on the flesh of one of the movers who are dismantling Dr. Channard's flat.

614831,4,6303265774,"I had already become a huge fan of Clive Barker's short stories by the time the first ""Hellraiser"" film came out, and I had very high hopes for it. After all, I thought, if Clive Barker can somehow translate his ghastly literary style onto the big screen, this could be a superlative horror film.

Well as it turns out, being a good horror writer doesn't necessarily make one a good film director. I didn't find the first ""Hellraiser"" film particularly scary at all, and I like my horror to be scary and, first and foremost, SERIOUS. ""Hellraiser"" was a mixed bag, but if anything it provided a showcase for Clive Barker's sense of the very, very weird.

If sheer, unadulterated WEIRDNESS gets your attention, you should take a look at ""Hellbound: Hellraiser 2."" As a sequel it's superior to the original, with a bigger budget, better special effects, and a gleeful amount of gore. Like the original, it's not particularly frightening, but there's something extremely ghastly about parts of this movie that gets under your skin and makes your eyes widen. The film essentially consists of a series of extremely bizarre set pieces, strung together by a so-so plot about an evil psychiatrist who wants to see something beyond the ordinary world we live in, and a young woman who has seen a bit of that mysterious world and now wants to rescue her father from it.

It's the aforementioned set pieces that make this film worth viewing. One in particular, in which the wicked Dr. Charnard finds himself getting a bit of a makeover in a strange Cenobite machine, is for my money one of the most seriously f*cked-up sequences in the history of horror film. I just kept watching it over and over and over. And at a time today when an overreliance on CGI in horror films ends up diminishing the impact of the special effects, the visceral impact of ""Hellbound"" is all the more refreshing.",1115251200,2,1877,4.699088145896656
614832,5,6303265774,"I'm a big fan of the Hellraiser series, so my opinion is bias! Hellbound is the only movie I ever went to see in a Theater more than once. I was hooked on Pinhead and the Cenobites immediately after seeing Hellraiser, and Hellbound clinched it for me, I became a loyal fan. Hellraiser is my Star wars! Loyal fans of Star wars can really talk about it, philosophically, technically and are militant about it. Any person who is a fan of SW will sit a put the movies in order of greatness and tell you why, in extreme detail! I'm like that with Hellraiser and I would put Hellbound slightly above the original. The first movie was a great horror movie, no doubt, but what grabs me about hellbound was the exploration of who the Cenobites were and the place they come from. The movie's explanation of what Hell would be like; a tailor made nightmare that you never wake up from. Yet, they show that the darkest of evil can have a soul, even if it is buried and just about forgotten. You have the same cast of Cenobites from the first movie and I must say that I like the female Cenobite and missed her in the movies that followed Hellbound. The female Cenobite seemed to have as much dialog as Pinhead, and I felt was just as enjoyable. She seemed to be almost an equal to Pinhead and yet has dissapered from the rest of the movies. We are introduced to Kenneth Cranham's character, Dr. Philip Channard, and evil surgeon who's curiosity of the occult had taken him down a dark and sinister path. His performance was brilliant and I was sorry that he was destroyed and would have loved to have seen him stay on as a continuing character. Cranham's performance was one of the best, right along with Bradley's. His character was believable and you felt his evil, right down to your bones. Like the first movie, and the really bad one that came after this one, most of the actors were poor, especially Ashley Laurence! God she is the worst! Everything from her weird facial expressions to the lifeless delivery of her lines, she is bad! Maybe if she was hot it would be tolerable but... Thankfully her performance doesn't take the movie down! Imogen Boorman's deaf girl character is worth mentioning. I thought she did a decent job portraying the deaf girl and it was essential that her character was in the movie, not for what she ends up doing, but to really show how evil Channard was. When he realizes that she is a prodigal problem solver (puzzles) and could help him in his quest, he snatches her, kills her mother (it's implied) and basically keeps her around for one thing, just in case it comes around, to solve the puzzle box. That's how cold and evil he was, and that's another endearing quality of this movie and something that the others have lacked. Hellbound would be top 2 to any Hellraiser fan, but I feel it is number 1, slightly edging Hellraiser. Also, when it comes to the horror genre you can't go wrong with this movie! In fact, you don't even need to see the first one; they reference all the key parts. So you can have a full understanding of what is going on. As far as horror sequels go, it is head and shoulders above any of the other series sequels, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween...

It picks off right after the end of Hellraiser with Kirsty waking up in a psychiatric hospital under the care of Dr. Chanard.  And this other doctor guy who she sort of likes.  On a sneak visit we find a dark side to the doctor.  He has a collection of the puzzleboxes, corpses, and even takes the matress with Julia's blook on it (from the first movie).  He eventually brings in the psychotic mental patient who sees maggots on his skin.  The doctor gives him a knife and in probably the scariest scene of the movie, the man screams and cuts up his body.  The blood ressurects Julia who grabs him and drains his blood.  Julia pretty much takes up what Frank was in the first movie.  The seducer.  The doctor eventually falls for her.

He brings this mute girl who Kirsty meets, who does nothing but solve puzzles to his house to solve the Lament Configuration.  The girl does and is freaked out when the cenobites show up.

And the doc and Julia are exploring the labyrinth of hell and so does the girl out of curiosity and eventually Kirsty in search of her Father, but instead has a run in with Frank and with Julia, while the doctor gets what he secretly wants when he meets Leviathan (who appeared as a giant puzzlebox, but as true fans of the comic books know, is really satan), he is made into a cenobite and starts terrorizing patients.

There a many cool things throughout the movie such as the individual hells, the labyrinth of hell, the humanity of the cenobites, and the fight between the cenobites and the Dr. Chanard cenobite.  Really good and really gory movie.",1091404800,,1804,4.428571428571429
614915,4,6303265774,"I really feel that the Hell Raiser ""tale"" should have been left on its own. Pinhead and Clive Barker's work is too precious to me, but then again, you can't help but want more!
 So from what I understand, the lady that helped Clive with the original Hell Raiser movie, which is based off of the book: Hell Bound Heart. Was given premission from Clive to continue on with the Hell Raiser story (can't blame him, easy money). What she came up with Hell Raiser 2-4. The effects all seem to be from the same effects artists, at least for part 1, and 2. And the story, while dragging it out a bit too far, and into somewhat comic book proportions, including some failure to explain small details, like how Pinhead came back from death, since he was slain in hell, and if he could come back, then why couldn't he ressurect his minions, rather than slaughter a dance club, and create some kool, yet some what gimpy cenobytes such as CD Man.
 Hell Raiser II remains most true in for to the feel and look of the original, with only a dash of comic book, and some VERY delightful creatures, beautiful women (pt 4), and interesting story line. The gore of course is great in the uncut version, and the show down is wonderful! ""The Doctor Is In"".
Bottom line, as much as I feel that the original should stand on its own, I am still very happy with the 1st 3 sequals. It is NO WHERE near as bad as the Candy Man sequals! :)
I'd give it a 5 star if part 1 did not exist.",1087344000,,1456,4.21505376344086

The cenobites are the best character demons ever made for a movie. They are truly evil. I think this one was better than the first one only b/c it explores the unimagainable. it lets us into there world and we don't want to leave without seeing what happens. I mean lust, sex, violence,we are all interested in a certain way. This movie explains that the greatest treasure is not always what you may think. I think that 1, 2, and 3 are the greatest gore movies of all time. Storyline is terrific. I like the way these movies make you feel guilty and downright weird. They make you feel like PINHEAD is your neighbor. The scene on the bed and the doctors patient is the most disturbing deathe scene of all time.

614917,5,6303265774,"Before I even begin my review, I will just state that the first film, ""Hellraiser"", is the best one. ""Hellbound"" however, is almost as brilliant as the first one. Of course there is gore galore; it's based on a Clive Barker book! How could you expect anything else?! I also thought that the story was brilliant; especially how Doctor Channard becomes the most poweful Cenobyte and how Pinhead, Chatterbox, Female Cenobyte and Butterball all sacrifice themselves to defeat him and, in doing so, redeem themselves and find solace in death. Now, normally my review would end here but I have to bring up one thing that REALLY cheesed me off... HOW IN ALL THE NINE HELLS IS A THIRD HELLRAISER EVEN POSSIBLE?!?! If Pinhead was freed by his sacrifice, there should not have been a third one at all!!! He was no longer Pinhead!!! Yet all of a sudden he magically appears in Part III?!?! I DON'T THINK SO!!!

614918,4,6303265774,"Firstly, Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 is not just a second-rate sequel, but expands on, and perhaps even betters it's original.  Now with Hellbound there's really two ways to approch it. #1 is to sit there, wracking your brain, and trying to make sence of the whole thing. And #2 is to put your chair right infront of the T.V., turn the lights down low (to create the horror movie atmosphere)press play, settle down and stare at the screen for a hour and a half.
 I chose the latter, which was probably for the best, because otherwise I'd probably be up all night. But don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this movie is confused or that it doesn't make sence or anything. What I mean is that I think they just tried to fit too much into one movie. There's enough matirial for two movies. But, hey I love it. Let's take a look-see: The new characters (Dr. Charnard, Tiffany) are both interesting (perhaps a little disterbed, but who cares?) plus Kirsty returns but Steve managed to slip out of it. But here's the part that trips me up: Dr. Charnard lets a mental paceint slice himself up royaly on the mattress containing Julia's soul,(very nasty) thus resurecting her. Resurecting Julia. Who in their right mind would do it? Well  Dr. Charnard falls in love with her,(and makes out with her) even though she's a skinned corpse (nice, hey?).
 Anyway off they all head down to hell. Actually I found the concept that everyone has their own, personal hell very intreiging. That was heaps interesting. So anyway everyone's there and basicly all hell breaks loose, thus the expression. Dr. Charnard gets turned into a Cenobite, who's linked directly to Levithan. And so there's another who's trying to kill Kirsty and co. Also Julia gets hers back on Frank for killing her in the original. But I think the best part of all is when Kirsty confronts the Chatterer, Butterball, Pinhead and She-who-must-not-be-named with their own humanity. But God knows how she managed to reconise Pinhead from the picture of Elliot Spencer. But then, God has no part in this flick. Also, I really liked the part in the beginning when they showed us how Elliot Spencer solved the dreaded box and was transformed into the delightfuly nasty demon, Pinhead. A painful and traumatic process, but not half as painful as watching TVSN from 7 til 12, but that's a different story.

 So it really is quite a good movie with some killer moments. And as for the gore, well there's a (...) load of it. Come on, let's face it; this movie can't go more than 1 minute without spearing, killing, sliceing, diceing, cutting, gutting, you get the idea. But here's the thing with splatfestival movies like Hellboud: they are compleate gross-outs at first, but after a while one just get so used to the grossness of it that the gore just washes over one. That's what I think of that aspect of Hellbound. But hey if I didn't want, dicapitation,skinning,throat cutting and dismembering I should've rented Bambi instead. Am I right? or am I right?

This is, without a doubt one of the nastiest, most sadistic movies I have ever witnessed. Infact I wouldn't even call this a movie, it's more like an experience.

 So all in all I really loved it, delightfully gory. It may even be better original and Hellraiser 3. So I recomend it,(if you can take it) your suffering will be legendary even in hell!",1080864000,3,3350,4.674023769100169

Anyone who doesn't like this film just isn't a horror fan & must spend the rest of their life watching Sesame Street! (and more disturbingly, liking it!).
It might not be the goriest movie ever (it is bloodier than the first), but it does has it's moments, the acting is as good as you're going to find in this type of film & the characters are awesome.
Pinhead is without doubt THE horror icon. Only Freddy, Jason Vorhees & Michael Myers come anywhere near Pinhead, but it terms of visual presence and downright creepiness they aren't even fit to lace old Pinhead's boots (assuming he wears any).
This movie really deserves 10 stars! Only the original Hellraiser beats it & it's well worth watching the 2 back to back as they fit almost seamlessly.

614920,5,6303265774,"There are few horror films that produce truly great sequels. Hellbound delivers this greatness in full realization. The gore level was turned up a notch, (which is saying quite a bit), the screenplay, though uneven, is witty and creative, with many dark, sadistic touches. The directing is top-notch and visionary. Nobody, save Clive barker, could have done a better job than Tony Randall. On the dvd's featurette ""lost in the labyrinth,"" Randall explains his mental demeanor at the time the film was made, and he believes that his outlook on life was quite bleak and pessimistic. These attitudes carry over beautifully to this disturbing, unsettling picture. Hellbound boasts, hands down, some of the most bizarre and nihlistic images in film since Salo. The image of the woman with her skull cracked open as she receives a labotmoy from Dr. Channard, the scene where a delusional man takes a razor to his skin, and over his groin, spilling blood in every direction, the image of the reborn Dr. Channard in cenobite form, the cracked out funhouse that is hell...I could really do this all day.
Hellbound doesn't have the grand scope nor does it have the finesse and style of Hellraiser (which is, in my opinion the greatest horror film of all time), but it surely delivers some very genuine originality and flash. if only all sequels were this spellbinding.",1076803200,3,1358,4.934497816593886

614955,3,6303265774,"This is a truly disgusting film, even eclipsing the first in terms of in-your-face gore and nastiness. It is also a complete muddle in terms of acting and plot, and makes relatively little sense. What saves this movie is its undeniable charisma. Like a certain sinister-looking golden puzzle box, it has a way of hooking you and dragging you kicking and screaming down its twisted path whether you want to go or not.
""Hellbound"" tells two stories which more or less intertwine as the movie goes on. One is the attempt of Kirsty, who survived the original movie, to resuce her dead father from hell. The other is the attempt by an evil doctor/psychiatrist named Chennard to open the door to hell without paying the going rate for it (in other words, he wants to let other people get ripped apart by fish hooks while he explores the mysteries of What Lies Beyond).
Of course, both attempts go awry, leading to a lot of blood-splattering, skin-filleting, screaming, and general unpleasantness. It turns out that Kirsty was summoned into the Outer Darkness not by her dead father Larry, but by his evil half-brother Frank, who as you may recall murdered Larry and stole his skin in ""Hellraiser I."" (family reunions with this bunch must be fun) But Frank ain't the only dead person to show up here: Chennard, using a technique that might be called skin grafting without anesthetic, ressurects Kirsty's wicked stepmom Julia, who was also offed by Frank in the last movie. Neither Frank nor Julia has much in the way of redeeming personal qualities, though I would give Frank the edge in the contest of who suffers more at the hands of the screenwriters: by my count he was ripped apart by fishooks twice, had his skin burned off once, and finishes up with his heart ripped out. Hard cheese, old chap!
It is of course, not Kirsty but the Cenobites who are the real stars of the film. They are only too eager to lay their hands on Kirsty, who outwitted them once before; but they lay off Chennard and Julia, because as it turns out, hell as a special plan for the doctor. Just as it has a special plan for the Cenobites themselves. Any guess to whether or not it involves something painful and disgusting?? (Hint: just about everybody in this movie gets double-crossed)
""Hellbound"" spends a good bit of its time in, yeah, you guessed it, hell. It explains something of the mythology of the Cenobites (how Pinhead came to be, for instance) and the box, but ends up posing more questions than it answers. It is undermined by the bad acting of Ashley Lawrence, who plays Kirsty, and by the fact that the producers sometimes seem more interested in making the audience gag than making the plot make sense....that scene where Chennard hands that crazy guy the straight razor is one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen in my entire life. And I've actually been to autopsies.
""Hellbound"" is a deeply flawed movie, like most horror pics. But it has an undeniable ability to grip the viewer despite those flaws. Clive Barker's universe, expanded here by director Tony Randall, is a fascinating, if really disgusting, place, a triumph of imagination. I would recommend this movie to any real fan of horror/macabre films.

I love the original movie, but this sequel is even better in so many ways.  It essentially picks up the story from the end of the first movie (providing almost too many flashbacks to make sure you are up to speed), where Kirstie (Ashley Laurence) has seen her uncle return to life sans skin to team up with her wicked stepmother to kill her father, and she has somehow survived two encounters herself with the Cenobites.  Little did she know that her troubles were really only beginning.  We find her in a mental hospital run by the cold and calculating Dr. Cannard (played to the hilt by Kenneth Cranham), who, as luck would have it, has been secretly delving into the secrets of the puzzle box himself.  He manages to get the bloody mattress upon which Julia died and brings her back to life with the help of some of his most insane patients.  He and Julia use a young girl unable to speak but gifted at solving puzzles to call forth the Cenobites and enter their world to satiate the mad doctor's deep need to ""know.""  Kirstie and the mute girl follow them into the infernal labyrinth where they encounter Kirstie's old friend Pinhead, who allows Kirstie time to explore because, after all, ""we have eternity to know your flesh.""  When Julia takes Dr. Cannard to Leviathan, lord of the labyrinth, god of flesh, hunger, and desire, he becomes a new force for evil in that realm.  Before the movie ends, there are some very dramatic events that add much depth to the entire Hellraiser series.
This is a gory movie; make no mistake about that.  If you don't want to see the human body mutilated in a number of fascinating ways, this is not the movie for you.  As a horror fan, I love the blood and guts, especially since it seems necessary rather than gratuitous to satisfy the requirements of this story.  Some of the special effects are a little cheesy toward the end, but one must remember this movie came out in 1988.  The original movie seemed pretty limited in scope, providing just a peek into the Cenobites world.  This sequel broadens that scope immensely and leads us on a visual journey of wonder and horror through the labyrinth which the Cenobites call home.  While the first movie naturally made one wonder where the Cenobites came from, this sequel provides many answers.  We learn much about Pinhead in particular, getting visual evidence of the manner in which he earned his nickname.  There are aspects about the movie's conclusion I did not particularly care for, but these issues are less important for those who are not hard core horror connoisseurs.  This is not a slasher film; those who squirm their way through a Jason or Freddy movie may find themselves unprepared for the extent of the horror in this movie.  Those of us who like our horror bloody and disturbing, though, will use this as the benchmark by which we compare all future gory movies.",1030060800,28,3147,4.648014440433213

615058,5,6303265774,"Hellbound is a gothic, bloody, gory, gloomy film that might be more Hellraiser than Hellraiser.  If that makes sense.
Though not directed by Clive Barker, it has his input, and the makers of this film made this a real horror sequel, continuing the story of Kirsty and family and coloring in the Cenobites further.  We even get a little bit of insight into the origins of Pinhead which will be further explored in Hellraiser 3.
Is this film incoherent at times?  Yes.  Is the plot addled?  Yes.  Is there A LOT of gore including head drilling, skinning, maggots, decapitation, throat slashing, and brain sucking?  Yes.  But if you're looking for more gloom and gothic atmosphere a la the original Hellraiser, then you'll enjoy this.
Hellbound is darker and has a more cynical tone than original film.  Here we find the outre Dr. Channard heading up his own psychiatric institute where Kirsty Cotton has been brought following the events of the night in the original Hellraiser.  As shes goes on and on about boxes and demons and her father in Hell the hospital medicates her.  But it turns out not only does Channard believe her, but he's been waiting for this his whole life.  He's a closet Hellraiser fanatic, so to speak, owning 3(!) boxes, having studied the mind as a labyrinth, and searched for the pleasure the Cenobites offer.
It's not long before the Cenobites are summoned and Kirsty, Channard, and a newly resurrected Julia from the original are running around Hell's garish-set hallways.  All 4 Cenobites are back again, though a different actress plays the slashed-throat female, giving her a decidedly different expression.  Pinhead gets more screen time (of course) and we even get his origin, making him more than a boogeyman.
Just remember, this is a gory film, even by today's horror film standards.  A lot of skinned bodies, a lot of hooks in flesh.  A long and extended scene of a fan slashing himself slowly to death.  But it all serves some twisted material which will definitely help you get in touch with your dark side.

now..in 1987 when the first hellraiser was shown i was to young to go see it..(i hate my mother for that..hehe)
well..i guess 3 is too young..*lol*
back to hellbound:
i like it..i like the acting,the monsters,the make up is cool(as always) and i like Pinhead who still gives me the creeps..he's well played be doug bradley...i respect that...
well..see it if you havn't allready..it's worth a look or 2",1026172800,,711,4.884297520661157
615139,3,6303265774,"This is the only true sequel to the original Hellraiser. The cenobites return and all the main characters are back. In this movie, Kirty Cotton travels to hell along with a muted young girl by the name of Tiffany in an attempt to rescue her father's soul, yet finds a nice surprise waiting for her in hell in the form of the Cenobites, her stepmother, Frank, and a crazy doctor.
Full of vivid and violent imagery, Hellbound:Hellraiser 2 takes further in the world of hell by offering the ideas of Leviathan and the creation of the cenobites. It is not as gruesome or as fun to watch as the first Hellraiser, but it is as good as many horror sequels can get. The ideas brought forth in this movie have been with heated debate among Hellraiser fans. This is definitely the most involved into the inner workings of Hellraiser mythology.
Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 is indeed not for those with a weak stomach and I suggest it for fans of the original and of the series only. The atmosphere of this movie and the feel is one that cannot be denied. After this, the series went into a slump until regaining steam with Inferno. This remains a classic along with the original. It is certainly not as entertaining and perhaps a bit tedious, but that does not stop it from being a worthy horror sequel.",1022457600,,1288,4.5085470085470085

Some people say this movie was way too gory and sick, but thats the way it was sapposed to be. Do you really think that there would be a film being made like this that would have pink bunnies and feathers instead of hooks and chains and Cenobites? Didn't think so. Speaking of Cenobites, those people(and/or demons) kicked [butt]!...though I would never enjoy becoming one...pins, hooks and chains tend to hurt a bit...

The sequel brings back Kristy Cotton(Ashley Lawrence) as well as Pinhead(Doug Bradley) and his cast of cenobites. We learn in the sequel how the Cenobites were created and where they come from.

The reason why I gave Hellraiser 2 four stars is  because out of the franchise Hellraiser 2 is the closest one to the all around goodness of the first Hellraiser.  Hellraiser 2 is the last to feature the original cast of Cenobites (which also happens to be the best) as well as the origin of the head cenobite, Pinhead, played by Doug Bradley.  Ashley Laurence, the actor who Portrays heroine Kristy Cotton, returns but her acting is cheesy, possibly due to the editing which makes a lot of her statements sound strange and out of place.  However the best part of Hellraiser 2 is the creation of a new Cenobite (which is somewhat shown) Dr. Channard, which is one of the coolest Cenobites ever and has some great lines.  All in All Hellraiser 2:Hellbound is a must see and a must have for any Hellraiser fan, what is seen is Hellraiser 2 is only briefly repeated in Hellraiser 3 and not very well.",1009929600,,1079,4.62303664921466

Clive Barker has proven to be a superior writer when it comes to horror, although it seems his tactics are to upset your stomach rather than frighten you. Don't get me wrong, Pinhead is a fantastic character, one of the best to come out since Freddy Krueger. I do recommend this movie.
But the DVD ""claims"" to offer both full-screen and wide-screen, but this it does not. The wide-screen is nothing more than the full-frame presentation with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, giving the illusion that it is in wide-screen. (Check it out for yourself, go to chapter 9 on the DVD and look at the elevator buttons, in full-screen, you'll see a button above the basement and maintenance ones, then watch it in wide-screen, and it is no longer there. Try it, you'll see.)

True, true, true... The blood and gore truly piles up, and you begin to think of ALL humans are nothing more than a means to see blood. It is, however, still fresh and original, despite tedious moments, and Clive Barker keeps it darks and brooding.
Hospitalised following her last misadventure, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) implores authorities to destroy a bloody bed at the carnage scene, but the enigmatic Dr. Channard (Kenneth Cranham) brings an addled patient there and unleashes a dread Cenobite instead.
The patient's bloodshed is truly gruesome, as the doctor purposely lets the man cut himself. But, as the movie convention goes, he is quickly and resourcefully tortured in the depths of the Cenobite hell. Clare Higgins returns, and she doesn't have any skin. Luckily, once she gets it back, Kirsty, at some moment, puts it on and has it slip off.
`Nuff said. It isn't meant to be groundbreaking - just a throwaway second part, letting us watch some great effects and watch the makeup artistry.

Big mistake. Instead of the cenobites going after her, they go after Dr. Channard.

615208,5,6303265774,"This film is even more complex than the first one. It is a voyage inside the brain, not the individual brain of one person but inside the collective brain of humanity. The brain is a labyrinth and it is entirely dominated and controlled by desires. But this film transforms death into a fourth dimension of life because death is just a permanent imprisonment in this labyrinth facing a permanent non-satisfaction of one's desires that are thus perverted into suffering or the inflicting of suffering to new visitors or arrivers.

But this film gives an explanation of whom the cenobites are. They are men, and eventually women, who made other humans suffer when they were humans themselves. Thus Pinhead was a colonial soldier who enjoyed torturing people. Julia becomes a guide in this labyrinth after her rebirth because she was a killer, a criminal, an assassin in real life. But a new cenobites is born in front of our eyes. The psychiatrist is transformed into a torturer because he was such a man in real life, using scalpels and saws to manipulate and mutilate brains.

The twist of this film is that the cube produces a new shape, a double trihedra that is the very symbol of desires, of the flesh. And it is another victim of the psychiatrist, a young girl who was locked by her mother in the hospital of that man, who is able to solve the puzzle of this double trihedra in order to close the cube again, and it closes the labryinth of desires and the brain.

This film is a metaphor, an enormous metaphor, of society, if we consider the brain as a representation or a mirror image of society, and it is. Hence Clive Barker reaches here a social level that is not always present, in such a complexity, in his work. Very often, the flesh, the desires, the feelings, the blood of life are more in the limelight. We must think that the reason is simple : this film is not based on a book. In other words it is purely and firstly visual ; not semantic or linguistic.

It's basically  plotless, using an unexplained inceidence to lure Kirsty Cotton back to  hell to try and rescue her father.  It turns out the the doctor at the  mental hospital she's in, though, is a typical mad-doctor.  He's been  collecting and studying all kinds of occult stuff for years, and has  aquired four of the puzzle boxes.  He's the kind of guy who does open brain  surgery on his patients, etc...  Well, he lets one of his patients kill  himself over the mattress where stepmom Julia from the first film died, and  the blood brings her back...she starts killing everyone and drinking their  blood to get her skin back.  Kirsty gets to hell, and it devolves into a  stupid bad-special fx spectacle.
But it gets worse -- This movie ruins  the appeal, the mystery, and the allure of the cenobite by making them into  squabling idiots.  There is one potentially good scene, a confrontation  between pinhead and the mad doctor, but it's made horrible by the  ineptitude of it's realization and it's unwatchably bad special  effects.

Apart from the major continuity error, and plot oversights (which  seems to be a major trademark in ALL of Clive Barker's movies and books),  like how come London has all of a sudden been magically transported in to  America?  When the little girl opens the box, (the same goes for Kirsty in  the original) how come hooks don't jump out and start tearing her apart.
But apart from that, it was a cool movie, it was one of many rare horror  movies in the nineties (before Scream made it cool again), amongst all the  Big Budgeted no brainers, it was cool to see a good horror movie like: In  the Mouth of Madness, The Prophecy, Death Machine The People Under the  Stairs.
But I get the feeling now, that horror films such as Scream are  becoming like a scooby doo senario, I'm just waiting for the killer to say,  'and I would of gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you pesky  kids.'
