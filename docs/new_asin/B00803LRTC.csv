5115510,3,B00803LRTC,"First of all, My Little Pony, Frienship Is Magic is a clever, cute, fun, and just plain awesome. My only problem with this show is that not all episodes are excellent, and though this DVD has some good episodes, there's really nothing spectacular about it. Here are reviews of the episodes on the DVD:

A Canterlot Wedding, Part 1 and 2: The ponies go to Canterlot to attend the royal wedding of Shining Armor and Princess Cadence, but the wedding because chaotic when the bride-to-be reveals her dark secret. Creative plot, yes, but seemed rushed and disappointing to me. (2/5)

Hearts And Hooves Day: Applebloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo try to find their teacher Cheerilee a special some pony, but once they use a love potion on Cheerilee and the perfect stallion (Applebloom's brother Big Macintosh) the two ponies can't avoid looking in to each other's eyes! Can the foals turn Cheerilee and Big Macintosh into normal before it's too late? A hilarious episode that contains the catchy song 'The Perfect Stallion'. (5/5)

Sweet and Elite: Rarity's stay at Canterlot is disturbed by stuck-up Canterlot ponies who threaten to ruin her friendships back at Ponyville! I remember I used to dislike this episode, but It's grown on me with it's good and suspenseful plot. (4.5/5)

The Best Night Ever: The ponies go to The Grand Galloping Gala in hopes of fulfilling their hopes and dreams, but it's not how they expected. A cute episode but not as funny as I thought it would be. (3.5/5)

If you like the episodes listed above, you should defiently buy this DVD. if not, you probably should just continue watching My Little Pony, Friendship Is Magic on television.",1342483200,6,1666,4.852112676056338
5115511,5,B00803LRTC,"""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"" needs no introduction. It has become a cultural phenomenon, being an example of truly great and accessible television that anybody of any gender, race or age can sit down and enjoy. It's fandom is one of the most welcoming and kindhearted in recent memory, and it has singlehandedly changed the way companies and fans interact. If you've never seen this show, go on Netflix and make the time to watch the first two seasons. You will not regret a moment of time spent with this show.

Now, this DVD's cornerstone is a set of two episodes that are indisputably some of the best in the series. Series protagonist (and huge bookworm) Twilight Sparkle discovers that her estranged brother, Shining Armor, is getting married to a princess who happens to be her old babysitter, one Princess Cadence. She and her five best friends are invited to be bridesmaids at the royal wedding, but the always cynical pony feels that something is amiss. Indeed, her suspicions prove correct, and soon the protagonists find themselves battling the forces of the Changelings, the queen of which has taken the place of the real Cadence in order to gain control over the land of Equestria. The ensuing battle is compelling, brimming with both action and laughs. If you think I've spoiled much, don't worry, there are plenty of other little twists along the way to keep you compelled.

In this critic's opinion, the two Royal Wedding episodes are the very embodiment of what made fans fall in love with ""MLP:FiM"" in the first place. There are an abundance of catchy songs, several bizarre comedic moments (many courtesy of personal favorite character Pinkie Pie), and an overall sense of warmth and kindness behind the show. That last aspect is important, because as you know, ""My Little Pony"" is based on a long-running line of toys by Hasbro. But this show definitely escapes the trappings of tie-in shows. Never does the show stoop to trying and pawn off toys to children; in fact, I've only seen one commercial for the My Little Pony toys during my whole time spent watching this show. In place of commercialization are good messages, strong morals, excellent role models, and great writing. To top it all off, the animation is top-notch, especially in the second season, no doubt thanks to the show's massive fan support.

If you have kids, get them this show. If you want to watch a good show, watch this for yourself. ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"" is one of the most excellent animated creations to ever be released in any format in the history of animation. It is smart, funny, touching, thrilling, and, most importantly, fun. Watch this phenomenon without delay, for it will surely be a cultural television touchstone years from now.",1338508800,7,2763,4.84957627118644
5115512,5,B00803LRTC,"My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Most people of the world, when faced with this show, or even the title, think of a girly girl show with flat characters, boring plots, poor animation, and no motivation other than to sell toys. I mean, it's a show about PONIES that have names like Twilight Sparkle, Princess Celestia, Pinkie Pie, Sweetie Belle, and forget the fact that these ponies come in every color of the rainbow. (Some even sport the entire rainbow.)

So why, pray tell, would a cartoon aimed at little girls between the ages of 4 and 8 be getting all of the attention and popularity, most of it coming from men between the ages of 13 and 35? It's not very complicated: the show, simply put, is good. It's a show that's not about selling toys, and instead focuses on delivering a well-thought-out story with memorable characters, delightful humor, enjoyable music, stellar animation, and not a sign of commercialism in sight.

There are several main characters in My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. The main protagonist is an anti social bookworm named Twilight Sparkle. There's also the hardworking Applejack, the hyperactive Pinkie Pie, the fashonista guru Rarity, soft spoken Fluttershy, and the competitve Rainbow Dash. Twilight also has a baby dragon named Spike who acts as her assistant. These characters are all exceptionally voice acted, and have actual character flaws and strengths that interact and mess with the situations and others around them. These characters all live in the land of Equestria, and are ruled by Princesses Celestia and Luna. Twilight comes to know all of the other ponies when Celestia sends her to Ponyville to make some friends during the opening episode. At first, she ignores the suggestion, but the personalities behind each of the five ponies who never seem to leave her alone grow on her. The characters are well-rounded, and any and everyone can relate to at least one of the characters, because they are so different.

The show's creator, Lauren Faust, can be remembered from working on the PowerPuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. Faust was quick to show audiences that just because a show is for girls does not make it cheaply made and full of rainbows, roses, pink, and nothing but happy sparkles with no problems in life. The stories that make up the My Little Pony phenomenon are well written and have several references added in for older audiences. These references are subtle, and engage anyone watching the show, because they are included in ways that simply work well. For instance, in one episode, a character jokingly calls Spike 'Huffy, the Magic Dragon'.

Unlike the past couple of versions of My Little Pony, there are several different kinds of story lines, but each and every one is unique and inviting. There are adventures in which a manticore, hydra, Ursa, the physical incarnation of evil and discord, dragons, and changelings all make appearances. There are other episodes where the focus is two characters who have to learn to get along and accept each other's differences. Each episode has a lesson to take away, but, unlike several shows, the lesson isn't shoved down the viewer's throat with little to no relation to the episode's story, but instead relates to the story, and is a true and honest lesson that has no limit to how old you need to be in order for it to apply to you.

Another appealing thing about this show is the music. The score is gripping and really helps set the mood for what's happening on screen. But the true gem can be found in the songs. Two of them have been nominated for an Emmy. What's refreshing about the songs are that they aren't random with no point or relation to the story. (For the most part. But, whenever a song like that does come up, the show is smart enough to point out such annoyances. Several times, Pinkie Pie has performed a song seemingly out of no where. Every time, a character has made a remark about the song, be it a sherrif and tribe leader saying it was ""The worst song [they'd] ever heard."" to ""Tell me she's not [singing].)

In all reality, the secret behind the phenomenon is that the show is simply good. It's a show that takes itself seriously and does not talk down to the audience. It exists because it's been able to appeal to such a large audience, and there's a reason it has. Yes, it's a show about ponies. Who have weird names, cutie marks, and come in a crazy amount of colors. But the characters are solid, the storytelling is fluid, the flash animation used works well and flows well. The music is enjoyable and will staying with you long after you hear it, and you just might find out that it does not bother you that such a song is still in your head.

I highly recommend this show to any and everyone. Because of this show, people have begun to embrace new art forms, and is that really such a bad thing?",1338422400,13,4873,4.6857476635514015
5115513,5,B00803LRTC,"According to a fan wiki, this DVD contains the two-part season 2 finale ""A Canterlot Wedding"" along with ""The Best Night Ever"" (season 1 finale) and ""Sweet and Elite"" and ""Hearts and Hooves Day"" (season 2). It's a strange mix of episodes mostly focused on the setting's upper crust. As with the show in general, this set is a mix of fantasy adventure and more laid-back, slice of life episodes. Also see the ""Friendship Express"" DVD for another odd mix.

If you haven't yet discovered this series and are at all interested in fantasy or cartoons, watch this one. Can't vouch for any previous MLP incarnations, but this is not the stupid, girly toy commercial you might think it is. The writing is fun and will respect your intelligence. The characters and stories are memorable. The show is up on YouTube, but if you've seen it you'll hopefully join me in supporting the show by buying this collection.

Would a bad show feature romance, singing, and a massive brawl with dueling gods and shapeshifting abominations in the same episode, and make it work?",1337385600,7,1054,4.754098360655738

This show is a throwback to many genuinely great cartoons back in the 90s. Its simply a treat to watch. The humor isn't stupid its smart! Do yourself a favor add this dvd to your cart now. Long Live MLP:FIM!

Edited Comment: New Review: Update!

My first comment was shallow at best, and this show deserves a better review so I decided to write a better composed review. This show deserves it even though its 12 midnight now. lol

I'll start my review with a little background about me and how I realized the awesomeness that is My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (MLP:FiM).

First a little bit about me, I am a college student studying electrical engineering at SDSU and cute shows like MLP:FiM help me unwind especially since course work is getting harder. I am senior for pony sake! I am an avid anime fan that loves in particular very ""moe"" ,extremely cute, anime. It is an acquired taste : ) Some examples of shows I like would be Mahoraba ~ Heartful Days ~, Strike Witches, Ore No Imouto ga Konnani kawaii wake ga nai, Working!!, Ruby Gloom, Pokemon, Azumanga Diaoh, and Yuru Yuri. I also like plenty of cartoons shows back from the 90s such as, Dexters Laboratory, Johnny Bravo, Ed, Edd and Eddy, the Flintstones, the Jetsons, Hey Arnold, etc... All shows are awesome in their own right, but I have to say that My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic steals the top spot in my list now. I can't believe it, but it so rightly deserves to be so. It takes everything about anime I like, it takes everything I like about cartoons and disney I like, melds them together perfectly. Ask yourself is that even possible?

I first realized My Little Pony Friendship is Magic during one of my study sessions at college. I was finished with homework and I decided that I deserved a break so I did what I usually did I looked up some information on the latest Anime coming out from Japan. I'm a big anime fan all the way back since Pokemon. Anyways, as I was surfing around on the internet on my favorite website animeph.com which by the way is the best place to go if you like cute animation like MLP:FiM. I get all my ""moe"" anime fix there. If you like the adorable eyes of the ponies and you like anime that website would be heaven for you as well. On one of the forums, I noticed some people chatting about  My Little Pony, as I continued to read their chats it intrigue me. Are they talking about the little girl's show back from the 90s? Why would teens let alone boys like it? Isn't too girly? So I decided to investigate myself and I looked around for the first episode and from there I was hooked, and the cuteness meter in my head blew up! So 52 episodes later, I became a bonafide fan. I couldn't get enough of it, and I'm anxiously waiting for the third season.

Why is My Little Pony Friendship is Magic so awesome? Well all have their own reason to like the show, but for me I think what won me over was the ""90s-esque"" cartoon dialogue in combination with the cute art style. That is the combination that practically gave me an awesomeness overdose. It is no surprise to me why this show has a older audience following for one it is reminiscent of the cartoons in the 90's were dialogue and jokes were smart and witty unlike today's cartoon's were most jokes are dumb and/or just plain weird. One other main aspect that sets this cartoon apart is the awesome voice actresses that really give all the characters depth, voice alone! It is a treat just to hear them talk, it blew my mind and it can only be witnessed when you watch the show. To top it off, since MLP:FiM is an all family show it is compatible with any age group! Great dialogue, characters, awesome musical shorts, and an educational value puts MLP:FiM above all the rest of this generation cartoons. MLP:FiM is simply a treat to watch.

The DVD that you are preordering: My Little Pony Friendship is Magic: Royal Pony Wedding is the best investment you'll ever do. It includes all the episodes the following episodes which are coincidentally some of my favorites:

With well over 40 million people in the United States who speak Spanish to some degree, it makes sense that many children and adults would benefit more from this program by watching it in the Spanish language dub commonly heard in much of Latin America.  40 million is more than the total population of some of these countries.

We'd never seen any of this my little pony series, but after these episodes, I am looking into buying season 1.  I will say that my 6 year old was very scared during the wedding movie, but she was fine if I was there. My 4 year old says she was not scared. I think it is scary, but exciting.

Shining Armor was a great remedy to this oversight.  This is a fairy tale story woven into a little girl's dream world.

5115609,5,B00803LRTC,"My Little Pony: Friendships is Magic is a great series to watch, well written plots, fun characters and surprising twists. This dvd was quite exciting, Cadence and Shining Armor are good characters to the show; As well as Chrysalis and the changelings. And of course I enjoyed all of the other episodes too involving the CMC, and the gang at the Gala. So just to sum up really quick, love this series and hope they never end",1350691200,,424,4.51948051948052

Only problem I found is that, because it's imported, it doesn't play on Xbox! Luckily I got my girl a portable DVD player for her birthday too and it works fine on that!",1350345600,,297,4.228070175438597
5115611,5,B00803LRTC,"These are five episodes that leave the mane cast's usual stomping (stampeding?) grounds of Ponyville in favor of the royal capital of Canterlot; well, except for the one set on 'Hearts and Hooves Day'. For some reason they're done in reverse order, with the final episodes of season 2 (the Royal Wedding) done first and then running back through Hearts and Hooves (the Cutie Mark Crusaders try to set their teacher up with Big Macintosh and discover that messing with magic potions is a bad idea); Sweet and Elite (Rarity tells a few little white lies about her friends to get in good with Canterlot aristocracy; what could possibly go wrong?); and The Best Night Ever (the Mane Six attend the Grand Galloping Gala and find out the hard way they dreams may not measure up to reality).

Great, fun, well done and entertaining for kids and adults alike, this is a very fine introduction to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.",1347062400,,924,4.703703703703703

5115614,5,B00803LRTC,"This DVD contains the epic two-part season finale and three great episodes. The episodes in question contain some of the most beloved songs in the series to date. The only issue I have is that it's not HD, I believe.",1344643200,,216,4.425

5115616,5,B00803LRTC,"Being brony may be one of the most fascinating fandoms of 2011,2012, and onward to 2013.

I think it what Faust created could be a start of redefining what a man is (or isn't), not being afraid to admit you enjoy a cartoon about marshmallow coloured horses intended for girls opposed to some brutal, violet, proud, and muscular macho man. I think it also might help close some gender gaps too, oh all girls have to be quiet, nonoffensive, and obedient beings.

Maybe I'm thinking too hard. I could go on and on about being a brony but here isn't the place. Eh, either way, nothing wrong with supporting a show you like, which is why I preordered  in the beginning of May and I have to say it is a good decision.",1344556800,,711,4.330827067669173

8523527,5,B00803LRTC,"Out of all the Friendship is Magic DVDs Hasbro dished out, they actually got this one right. We get the 2-part Season 2 finale ""A Canterlot Wedding"" which is one if the greatest stories in FiM, the Rarity episode, ""Sweet and Elite"" which carries on the celebration theme, celebrating Twilight Sparkle's Birthday, ""Hearts and Hooves Day,"" a Cutie Mark Crusader episode that still shares the wedding theme of trying to have a couple hook-up, and finally ""The Best Night Ever,"" the great Season 1 finale which is as good as ""A Canterlot Wedding"" and also shares the celebration theme. Not many special features. Just 2 sing-alongs and coloring sheets.

I will point out the only two 1 star reviewers here. Uh, just what part of these episodes is dark and violent? There's not even any blood in this and its no darker than a Disney Movie. You crazy, sensitive parents have a really warped idea of what ""scary"" and ""violence"" really is, smh. If you can't even expose your children to a TV Y rated batch of episodes, what do you expose them to? Give me a break.",1486944000,,1055,4.611702127659575
