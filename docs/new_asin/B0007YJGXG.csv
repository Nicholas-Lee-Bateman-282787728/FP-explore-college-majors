8054104,1,B0007YJGXG,"I ordered this dvd from the UK, believing that I was purchasing a yoga dvd that also provided explanations & links between the asanas & ayurvedic dosha constitutions. However, throughout the 3 practice sesssions there is no mention at all of ayurveda - in fact it is much like any other yoga dvd available. As I am studying ayurveda & its links to yoga I thought this would provide useful information as well as a practice suited to the doshas - it does not. The mantras cannot be clearly heard as she talks over them & there is no practice sheet included as mentioned on the packaging. Most dissapointing & not suitable for yoga beginners. I am tempted to return it as I believe it is falsely advertised.",1297036800,,705,4.515625
8054105,4,B0007YJGXG,"For me the wonderful thing about Sarah Tomlinsons' Ancient Ayurveda Yoga Series is that here is a yoga sequence that  challenges us to slow down and observe the inner workings of our bodies. The calm and mindful presentation of this DVD reflects the quiet mindfulness with which we are invited to practice. Resting between each of the first 7 postures gives the practitioner the chance to internalize and notice the bodily sensations, a chance to move with awareness into the more complex postures that follow.

I have found it very easy to follow and practice with the DVD. With the musical quality of Sarah Tomlinson's voice acting as a soothing guide I have even found myself able do some of the more challenging postures, like Swan, that I was previously unable to do. I also find it fascinating the way each posture is connected with a beautiful Yantra and Mantra.

Here at last, is a mature yoga DVD that gets away from the frantic 'aeroba-yoga' fanaticism of recent years. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a soothing yoga experience.",1118275200,5,1053,4.806629834254144
8054106,5,B0007YJGXG,"In sanskrit, Ayurveda means the study of life. According to ancient Hindu texts, all healing systems stem from Ayurvedic medicine. This Ancient Ayurveda series dvd, led by Sarah Tomlinson with clarity and insight, provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana, symbol and metaphor. Tomlinson, acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths. To effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds, we must change habitual patterns in the body. The poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements, and Tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit. Filmed against a simple, soothing background, Tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles. Instead, the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master Gandharva,directly relates to the series in it's use of each of the planetary mantras.

Tomlinson's has a great depth of knowledge about ayurveda, and she weaves many subtle suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into the practice. This dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced student: beginners will feel supported and encouraged, as well as exhilirated by the practice, and more experienced students will appreciate the multi-level aspect of Tomlinson's class.

8054107,1,B0007YJGXG,"This is the worst yoga tape I have personally seen. The production value of this tape is horrible. First problem, the entire tape was shot with one camera. The whole time you just get a side view of the instructure. For thirty dollars I would like multible angles. There was moment I thought she was going to stop her pose to adjust the focus. Secondly, it looks as if the whole tape was shot in the instructures bedroom. And a small bedroom at that.

There is nothing new as far as the routine goes. There are no new poses, or an ancient mind, body practice. The insructure seems bored with the routines as she is talking, very monotoned the whole time. And her voice is very nasal and just shall we say not soothing. This is just a badly done yoga routine that is horribly overpriced. If you want an excellent yoga routine try Shiva Rea or Baron Baptiste. STAY AWAY from this routine. It is the first Yoga tape I returned in three years!!!",1117670400,16,941,4.377142857142857
8054108,5,B0007YJGXG,"this is a must have!!  the dvd combines both the spriritual and physical aspects of yoga, bringing this ancient practice to the present time.  Sarah mindfully approaches this yoga series with valuable information that will not only heighten your current yoga practice, but will allow you to relax and connect with yourself mentally and physically.  in addition to a beautiful practice, the dvd package includes a chart combining the poses, chants and yantras in an accessible form.  the Ancient Ayurveda Yoga Series should be a part of any regular yoga routine!",1112486400,5,561,5.131868131868132

8054110,5,B0007YJGXG,"Finally, the relation between Ayurveda and Yoga are realized in this one beautifully produced DVD.  Body, Mind and Soul are all addressed in this miraculous Series of poses so elegantly demonstrated by Sarah Tomlinson, whose voice transports you to another level of consciousness.  The effect after doing the Series is an awakening unlike any other... there is a liberation in the breath, in the spine that is dramatic.  And tension is gone!  The healing potential of doing this practice on a regular basis is tremendous - healing on every level.  I would recommend this for any level Yoga enthusiast.  And be sure to turn on the Mantra background to listen to the magnificent chanting of Gandharva.  Great graphics as well - a chart which makes it so easy to understand the relationship between asanas, planet and yantra that go together.  This is NOT to be missed.  Buy it for all your friends, they'll thank you!",1111276800,6,915,4.851612903225806
