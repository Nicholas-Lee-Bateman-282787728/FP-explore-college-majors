7870748,5,6304414692,"Hello, this is for fans of the 1991 Dark Shadows series. We all know it was a sad, regrettable thing that NBC pulled the plug on this show...with time who knows how much more interesting it could have become (it also would have been nice to give it a little time to gain a large, steady audience).

This special, ""Dark Shadows Resurrected"" is only available on VHS; it was released in 1996, the 30th Anniversary of Dark Shadows, and 5 years after the cancellation. It is hard to find!!! I did locate my copy on Amazon. I do not actually know if this program ever aired on television, but it is released by MPI, as are all 12 of the Dark Shadows episodes.

I enjoyed watching it, and if you are a big fan of '91 D.S. then you would want to see this and add it to your collection. If you did not prefer the 1991 series, then you most likely will not care about this. I do not think it was spectacular in any way,  but it was nice to ""revisit"" the show. There are some insights into the behind-the-scenes goings on of the show. This tape features: some bloopers, outtakes, interviews, and some scenes. There are interviews that appear to be circa 1991 when the show debuted. However, it seemed from the way in which they spoke that Barbara Steele (Dr. Julia Hoffman), Barbara Blackburn (Carolyn Stoddard) and Joanna Going (Victoria Winters) have some interviews which took place after the show was off the air. Not every cast member is here represented in interviews however. Notable appearances are the three I just mentioned, plus Dan Curtis himself, Jim Fyfe (Wille/Ben Loomis) and a few others, like Julianna McCarthy (Mrs. Sarah Johnson).

There is also a clip from one of the fan festivals (conventions) where you'll see Adrian Paul (Jeremiah Collins), and Lysette Anthony (Angelique).

You may also desire to obtain a copy of ""Dark Shadows Resurrected"" the book, by Jim Pierson - hardcover & softcover available. It was published in 1992 by Pomegranate Press, as are the other ""official"" Dark Shadows publications. This book contains detailed episode summaries, interviews, lots of photos, all the Victoria Winters voice-over intros to the episodes, complete Cast Listing (characters/actors) and some other items.

If you are really in withdrawal for 1991 Dark Shadows, you can visit/join ""Dark Shadows revival series 1991"" on Facebook!! We'd be happy to see you there.",1271203200,,2373,4.789731051344743
7870749,5,6304414692,"If you,like me,enjoyed the 1991 DARK SHADOWS mini-series,you'll love this! Great behind the scenes look with cool interviews with the actors and,of course,the man himself-Dan Curtis. Includes bloopers that show the actors' sense of humor and interesting MAKING OF clips. It's a shame the show wasn't allowed to grow. Thank you MPI VIDEO for keeping this stuff available!",997488000,6,370,5.396551724137931
7870750,5,6304414692,too bad this show ended so soon. i figure it might not have been cut short if the gulf war hadn't happened because dark shadows started just before the war broke out and all those bullitens.,977875200,,190,4.305555555555555
