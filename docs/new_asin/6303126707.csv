570487,5,6303126707,"This is one of the better programs I have seen on TV, and it is a great overview of the training and flights of U.S. astronauts up through the Moon landings.  It includes stunning film of astronauts in space, and the very  haunting story of the 3 Apollo men who were killed in 1967.  There also are  some interesting clips of Soviet cosmonauts.  The narration and the  statements by former astronauts and other NASA employees are excellent,  including a lot of common sense and a good sense of humor.
It is good to  see the astronauts who put their lives on the line get a chance to speak  for themselves in ""Moon Shot.""  They describe many dramatic  incidents which were little known at the time.  Their opinions of the  silliness of bureaucrats and loony academics are worth the price of the  video alone.
One of the most heartening parts of the video is the message  given by the Apollo 8 astronauts back to Earth as they were orbiting the  Moon in 1968, while, at the same time the world was undergoing much  turmoil.
Overall, it is a very moving story about the heroism and  dedication of the astronauts and others in the race to the moon.",930614400,5,1144,4.470873786407767
570488,5,6303126707,"Moon Shot is educational as well as entertaining.  The movie is an excellent and necessary supplement to anyone interested in space travel and astronomy, and it serves as a good introduction to space/astronomy  newcomers.  Many are unaware that the Mercury and Gemini programs were  essential to ensure man's trip to the moon and ""safe return to  Earth"" during the Apollo program.  WELL DONE!",913680000,2,392,5.142857142857143
570602,5,6303126707,"As others have said, it's just shocking that this has never been released on DVD or blu-ray.  This was the BEST documentary ever made about the Space Program, and there have been hundreds.  The only reason I keep my LaserDisc player from 1994 is that I have the LaserDisc copy of this.  In the wake of Neil Armstrong's death, maybe someone will remember this fantastic production and get the process started.",1346112000,,408,4.71830985915493
570603,5,6303126707,TURNER HOME ENTERTAINMENT!!! PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD or BLU-RAY SOON. There is a lot of people that want to own this!,1345939200,,120,4.5
570604,5,6303126707,"Just to reiterate what others have said. Where's the DVD? I keep coming here time to time looking for it to finally be available on DVD. You cannot even find this program airing on TNT, even at 3:00 in the morning. Many many folks out there do not know what they are missing since it's virtually unavailable. You may say that you could find a VHS copy somewhere, but someone who has not heard about this great program wouldn't know to even look for it.

This program was long enough to cover a lot of things, yet short enough that it leaves you wanting more.",1311811200,,558,4.314285714285714

570606,5,6303126707,this is the film that really got me excited about space flight at a kid. it was great to see it again.,1269302400,,102,3.6818181818181817
570607,5,6303126707,"There are many documentaries made of the United States mission and race to the moon. Turner Broadcasting developed this special for the 25th anniversary of the moon landing.  This production interviews the original surviving Mercury astronauts and all other astronauts who helped get us to the surface.

It is told from the perspective of Deke Slayton.  He passed away during the making of the series, so Barry Corbin (who played the astronaut on Northern Exposure) narrates it with humor and warmth.

This is the untold story from the men who were there.  Footage of astronaut testing, Russian films, and interviews make you relive the feeling of our accomplishment all over again.

It's the most entertaining four hours, and you will feel a sense of awe and pride with the courage and determination of the people involved.

This should really be made into a DVD, as I have nearly worn out my original VHS copy.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!",1250726400,2,936,4.879746835443038
570608,5,6303126707,"I was fortunate enough to see this on its original TBS broadcast in 1994 and have just finished re-watching it for the first time in several years in honor of the fortieth anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Having not seen it in so long and having been highly impressed with then, I was intrigued to see this again and wondered if my wonderful memories of it were still true. As it turns out, the memory didn't cheat on this occasion. Moon Shot was a fantastic and personal look at the Space Race from its beginning in 1957 to effective epilogue in 1975.

This documentary series is based upon the book written by astronauts Deke Slayton and Alan Shephard (both of whom are now deceased). The series is told from the point of view of Slayton in the form of narration from actor Barry Corbin. Corbin proves to be a perfect choice for the voice of Slayton (who died during the making of the series in 1993). As Slyaton, Corbin brings a wide range of emotions to his narration rather then a possibly monotone form of narration and by the end of it one could be convinced he is Slayton. Corbin though is the tip of the iceberg.

The series is also full of interviews as well. These range from other astronauts (including the book's co-author Alan Shephard) plus various individuals such as those who worked for NASA or reporters who covered NASA in this period. The interviewees each bring their own personal perspectives and allow for a much fuller version of events to be shared. The interviews also present a rather interesting historical document in themselves as many of the astronauts interviewed including Shephard, Wally Schirra and Stu Roosa to name a few have since passed away (Roosa passing away just months after the original broadcast). The interviews represent both a fuller picture of events and an interesting historical document rolled into one.

The series also makes extensive use of archive material as well. Much credit goes to the filmmakers in successfully bringing nearly twenty years worth of events into a just over three hour package which is entertaining, tense and informative even to someone who has spent their life studying the space program. Whiel there is a considerable amount of mixing and matching of stock footage which can become noticeable at times if you know enough, I suspect that the general viewer will remain oblivious to much of that (as I did until my most recent viewing). All in all though it is program that counts and the fact that this is as fascinating to watch today as it was fifteen years ago should speak to the success of the filmmakers.

Moon Shot isn't just another documentary on the Space Race. It is that familiar story told from the perspective of those on the inside of those events ranging from Deke Slyaton (in the form of Corbin's fine narration), interviews and archival footage in a from that is never boring but entertaining, tense and informative. As a result, Moon Shot (like its literary counterpart) takes a fascinating period of history where man first reached out into the night sky come alive again and, as someone who was born well after the fact, offers an amazing gateway into the past. I highly recommended this series along with the films For All Manking and In The Shadow Of The Moon as the best programs to watch about the Apollo missions.",1248048000,2,3330,4.726333907056799
570609,5,6303126707,"Great documentary of the drama of the Apollo Project as told by those who were there.  Everyone should see this video, and hopefully they will put it out on DVD soon as my VHS is getting rusty...",1226880000,,195,4.27027027027027
570610,5,6303126707,"I have used this documentary in my physics classes for the past 8 years during our unit on planetary and satellite motion, and they always LOVE it.  The ""storytelling"" presentation really pulls them into the film, and they get so attached to the Mercury Seven that we have to pass around the tissues when Gus dies in the Apollo I fire.  It also serves as a springboard into a great historical discussion of that era - one that many students never make it to in class.  And, of course, we follow it up with a field trip to the Space and Rocket Center in nearby Huntsville, AL.  Now if I could just get this on DVD . . . my tapes are starting to wear out!",1198454400,,653,4.158730158730159
570611,5,6303126707,"Moonshot is an excellent documentary. It is over 3 hours long, and I wish it was longer. I went to amazon today intending to get a DVD of this. I already have a VHS copy.",1193184000,,170,3.8857142857142857
570673,5,6303126707,"Fantastic history of the space program, narrated by Barry Corbin (voice of the late Deke Slayton), but featuring interviews with the men who were there, including Adm. Alan Shepard, first American in Space. They have some of the most amusing stories about those early missions that you could ever hope to hear. The companion book is also terrific, goes into much more detail than the movie could ever hope to, even across the best part of four hours.

I have to add to my voice of agreement to many others who would like to see this movie re-released on DVD (or better yet, Blu-Ray). (12/21/14)",1170720000,,594,4.6571428571428575
570674,5,6303126707,"This has got to be the best documentary ever made about the space race.  It's absolutely nerve racking even though you know what is going to happen.  I've watched this film and read this book over and over and everytime i do i find myself biting my nails.  Right now i'm looking for the DVD version to add to my collection.  I already have the book and vhs movie.

This movie/book really gives you the details of what these heros actually went through, their thoughts and the guts it takes to be an astronaut.  These men really have nerves of steel and after reading this book it gives you a real appreciation of what it took not just from these men but the supporting cast!  If There was a task that needed to be done that no one thought was possible I'd turn to Gene Krantz and his team, cause if it was humanly possible they would be able to figure it out and accomplish it.

Thanks again to these men for taking us to another level and also for an enjoyable book and video to watch.

Thanks

570675,5,6303126707,"This is the definitive account of manned space flight from the selection of the original Mercury 7 astronauts to the moon landings. Excellent use of first-hand narratives by the astronauts themselves and refreshingly free of the public relations hype that seems to permeate earlier attempts at these stories. Moonshot tells its story with accuracy and grit, allowing the real drama of the events to speak for themselves.",1158019200,,420,5.2835820895522385
570676,3,6303126707,"The footage in this two-tape series is stunning, but I have to admit that the narration by Barry Corbin makes me wonder if I ever want to see this again.  To me, his voice is inseparable from the character of Maurice Minnifield in Northern Exposure, the sarcastic and difficult former astronaut on that TV series.  His ""colorful"" phrases like, ""That went over like a turd in a punch bowl"" really caused the film to lose its appeal to me.  Compare that with the ""colorful"" language of Pete Conrad in ""From the Earth to the Moon,"" which was an accurate representation of how Conrad really talked, and therefore worked much better in that film.  Moon Shot is a documentary, but with the way they handled the narration, it seems too contrived to me.",1122508800,,745,4.621212121212121
570677,5,6303126707,"This is probably the most lively and interesting story about the US space program made. This show is narrated by Barry Corbin (who played fictional astronaut Maurice Minnifield on Northern Exposure) in the person of Deke Slayton,the most forgotton of the Mercury Seven,America's first group of astronauts. Set against the glory days of the space program,the dialog is based on Slayton's book and is rife with his colorful dialog,describing the events from a more human and emotional perspective rather then the normal cold war era space story,full of wonder and worship. This story has alot of drama,human insight into a then unknown and often scarry possibility of space travel told by a real fly boy. And Slayton often steps out front with his wit and charm. Also instead of gathering historians and experts the story is assisted with the help of surviving Mercury astronauts and engineers.

  The most notable section (and the most frightening) is Corbin's dramatic reading of Slayton's graphic description of the events leading up to the Apollo 1 dissaster in 1967 when one his his fellow Mercury seven was killed in a flash fire resulting from poor hardware and an overly anxious NASA's need to meet JFK's goal of a man on the moon by 1970. And in the end,after years of suffering from a heart fribulation that cost him much of his astronaut career Sleyton succombs to his affliction before the memoirs were completed. But considering the touching statement made by Slayton beforehand it's clear he still felt like 'one of the luckiest men on the face of the Earth' until his final days. For those who want to know the inner mental workings of an astronaut who need go no further.",1115769600,,1685,4.884615384615385
570678,5,6303126707,"I really liked the personal and intimate commentaries by some of the early NASA astronaut veterans. I enjoyed seeing and hearing Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Jim Lovell, Frank Borman, Buzz Aldrin and Gene Cernan to name just a few. Also, thought the overview of Project Mercury through Apollo was very insightful and educational.

The VHS video and sound quality is excellent, but, still would love to own a DVD copy.",1113523200,3,414,4.914285714285715
570679,5,6303126707,"The many behind-the-scenes videos made this a wonderful video.  The current interviews with surviving astronauts was a good touch.  I was saddened that Deke Slayton did not live to this project's completion.
The video was much better than the book.  For text, I recommend FLIGHT by Kraft or DEKE by Slayton.",1041465600,,307,4.980392156862745
570680,5,6303126707,"Using Deke Slayton's homespun (and salty!) language filtered through the earthy voice of Barry Corbin, Moon Shot is the definative history of the NASA Space program.
This documentary uses an ocean of archival footage and stunningly accessible, honest, humourous and illuminative first person narratives of all the key players to tell the complete story from Mercury to Skylab and all the journeys in between. As great as Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff is, Moon Shot is even more complete.
Clocking in at over 3 hours in running time, Moon Shot flies by in a second as it is filled with fascinating insights and visions of the brave men (and the women who supported them) who took us into the final frontier.
The moon landing is one of man's greatest achievements and this inspirational documentary caputures history in a manner befitting a classic epic film.

A strong narrative that also features many of the original U.S. astronauts of the Mercury 7, Gemini, and Apollo eras (great companion to the book).  A good way to get an accessible and entertaining review of this exciting time in our nation's history, one that inspired many Americans (including myself) to pursue engineering and science careers.  In retrospect, the fact that we landed 6 pairs of astronauts on the moon (in spite of the perilous Apollo 13 flight) seems extraordinary and something clearly from a different era.",1515456000,,590,4.9393939393939394

Narrated by actor Barry Corbin, it is lively, dramatic, even fun--it's also chock full of great historical film and video clips from the period. It is especially touching and special in that it shows one of the last informal assemblages of six of the seven then living Mercury astronauts (the Mercury astronaut gathering shown was recorded in the 1990s). If only the producers would assemble all the footage of the roundtable gathering shown only in bits and pieces here. ""Moon Shot"" is based on the book of the same title.
