4847389,5,B005NGKJW0,"I think what I most enjoy about this DVD is the fact that Coach Nicole is a real person, not some perfectly sculpted Hollywood trainer promoting a body image and program that's completely unrealistic for normal people. I also think the ability to kick it up a notch, or dial it back, depending on your level of fitness, makes it something that people of just about any level of fitness can do.",1325808000,17,393,4.472222222222222
4847390,5,B005NGKJW0,"I love this DVD for so many reasons. Coach Nicole is so personable and encouraging. Her ""back-up"" girls have ""real"" bodies -- something you don't find very often on workout DVD's. The 28 plan on the DVD is awesome -- just click on the day you are on and it automatically starts the workout. So cool! I haven't seen any other DVD's with this feature. Finally, there is a count-down clock on the screen so you know how much time you have left, which definitely helped me stay focused and motivated!",1325808000,42,496,4.461538461538462
4847391,5,B005NGKJW0,"This DVD has so much variety--it's not just your basic curls and squats that you've seen 100 times before. Coach Nicole has created fun and unique exercise combinations that are interesting to do and you really feel them, too! I love the 28 day workout calendar on the DVD menu, and the plan itself has so much variety to keep you from getting bored and help create ""muscle confusion"". The 28-day plan starts with shorter workouts to ease you into exercise and progresses you gradually over four weeks to harder and longer workouts. The 30 Minute Challenge routine is the best--it uses dumbbells like a kettlebell and you really work up a sweat. I was skeptical that a single DVD could really show so many intensity levels as it claims to (""three intensity levels for every exercise""), but it really delivers!",1325808000,64,809,4.74468085106383

Coach Nicole, I wouldn't weigh 210 and be joining a 28 fitness boot camp for beginners if I knew what a mamba was or if I was able to do a new exercise move every ten seconds. Wish I hadn't spent 12.99 on another dust collector.

Coach Nicole offers an easy to follow work out, and I especially love that the workouts are laid out in a monthly format so it's easy to keep track - you can just pick the day of the week you're on and start working out! It increases intensity as you go thru the month, but they are all really good workouts! I've been recommending it to my friends as a good alternative to some of the other fitness routines out there (I have Jillian Michaels 20 minute workouts and to me she is not motivating rather more demeaning, Coach Nicole is more inspiring to work out with).",1440374400,,595,4.274336283185841

4847416,5,B005NGKJW0,"More motivating than 30 day shred, and much more variety in the moves which keeps it way more interesting. I first tried 30 day shred and the tone of that dvd is a harping "" give it all you can so we can get outta here"". With JM's constant verbal reminders about how hard it is, how its only 20 minutes so its gotta be hard, look how hard the girls are working etc etc.. it always made me feel like I just wish it was over already.

Not so with this one, Coach Nicole gives off such a different vibe about working out that is pleasantly motivating. Though it is hard, I don't find myself wishing it was over as I am doing it. And even though the dvd has a clock countdown on the screen, which I love, somehow the clock helps with the motivation. I just finished the 28 day program and was not bored at all...and a few of those days are 30+ minutes. I also love the days off and I plan to do this video again a few times, since several levels are presented throughout and my goal right now is to get in better overall shape.

I also finished 28 days injury free thanks to her reminders on what to focus on. As far as the fancy footwork complaints, I don't like grapevine either so I substitute a move I loved from 30 day shred, the "" skater' move. It's cardio, she often tells you that also, so ...anything you do to get your heart rate up ,in good form, is going to do the job. The boxing arm/ footwork is really hard for me to coordinate,  but I really want to learn that so I keep trying and just keep moving and laughing at my uncoordinated mistakes.

Lastly, here's what i have learned over the years about protecting my knees and back..in case this helps someone else. Though I have always had a physical job I never was athletic and over the years I hurt myself most every time I tried to work out.  The fine points of form can be subtle if you are starting, or, if like me, you are overly enthusiastic about giving it your all.

First, if you don't have a lot of strength be careful not to do moves by throwing your weight around, its really important to pay attention to form and control so you will gain strength in your muscles. Also, you want to use your big muscles to protect your knees and back. I used to squat and lunge by pushing my body down which threw the weight forward on my knees; I have learned to push back and down to use my leg muscles and protect my knees. On the ab work on the mats I am learning to really focus on feeling it in the abs, not the neck, shoulders, arms. etc..

All in all I like this the best of any exercise video and after a few times through I will be looking for others by Nicole. For the curious, I did not magically lose any weight on either program, but then again, I did not change my eating or scotch habit either :-)) My current goal is to get stronger and in better physical shape, then I will work on the 15 or 20 pounds I'd like to lose.

Edit 2/15 I completed this tape again and went back to 30 day shred. I found Level 3 of that to be the perfect transition after two rounds with this video.",1419120000,,3052,4.075

4847439,1,B005NGKJW0,"Bought this for my wife and all I can say is that she is very coordinated and works out with any one of her approximately 15 different workout DVD's she currently owns. When she tried this one she got so frustrated that she turned it off before it was even over. The instructor goes very fast and doesn't explain the moves or techniques very well before she starts doing them. She moves from one thing to another with very little guidance or instruction, leaving it completely up to the individual watching the DVD to figure out for themselves how to do it.

Would not recommend this to anyone, even for $8",1390953600,3,606,4.45945945945946
4847440,5,B005NGKJW0,"I collect workout DVD's, and this is one of my favorites! Coach Nicole is very encouraging and motivating. There are three levels shown on each workout...beginner, intermediate and advanced...so it works for everyone. You will need dumb bells and a yoga mat. You can follow Coach Nicole's 28 Day plan, or mix and match the workouts to suit your needs. I really enjoy the variety.",1389225600,,379,4.846153846153846
4847441,4,B005NGKJW0,"I would recommend this DVD to someone who has been doing low-grade exercise like walking around the block but isn't ready to go to a group exercise gym class, or doesn't have access to a group exercise class.

I would NOT recommend this DVD to anyone who has knee or joint issues.  For me personally my best next step after walking was to seek out water-based exercise because it was kind to my joints.  (I have knee arthritis)  At 300+ lbs although I could walk a few miles for exercise, I would not have been able to keep up with these workouts and would have found them extremely frustrating.  Had I tried, I would have probably injured myself.  Now, 180 pounds off, four years later, I still can only do the ""easy"" lunging or jumping options.

I would also NOT recommend this DVD for someone who is already training for particular sports or doing dedicated lifting with a trainer.  They will have specific needs and goals that the DVD will probably not address.

Hints for getting the most out of this DVD:

1) Print out a copy of the calendar to help keep track of where you are in the workout.  You can cross off the days as you do them.

-Google for ""28 Bootcamp"" (without the quotes) and find the link titled ""28 Day Boot Camp DVD - SparkPeople""
- Find and click the button that says ""Already bought the 28 Day Boot Camp DVD? Get tips to help you get the most from your 28 day program! START NOW!>""
- In the upper left there is a section titled ""Boot Camp Tips & FAQs.""  Click ""Get Started"" in that section.
- You can right-click on the picture of the calendar and choose ""Open image in new tab.""  Then print it.

2) Use the calendar on the DVD to play the workouts even if you're not specifically following the 28-day plan.

On the DVD you can play the workouts from the 28-day calendar or from a list of workouts.  On the computer when I select an individual workout the next one on the DVD starts playing immediately after, which is inconvenient.  The best way to use the workouts seems to be to play them from the calendar, because that plays just the desired warmup, the workout, and the cool down, in the right order.  Having a printout of the calendar can help you plan ahead which workout option you want to use.

3) Have a variety of weights available

I found it helpful to have a variety of dumbbells available, depending on the exercise.  For some of the high-rep shoulder exercises it's hard for me to go above 5 lbs without losing form.  For the squats, a pair of 10s is just fine.  For the curls 8s were good.

About strength training:

I don't really consider the workouts on this DVD to be about strength.  Although there are dumbbells involved, these workouts are primarily about burning calories.  High reps with small weights is not the most efficient way to build muscle.

I think it's of more metabolic benefit to build and maintain muscle efficiently using low reps and high weight so that I'm burning more calories all the time. This is why I do high weight, low reps, with a barbell these days for my strength workouts.  I prefer to leave the cardio to spin classes and such.",1388620800,,3108,4.411247803163445
4847442,5,B005NGKJW0,"I am trying to lose weight. And I was going to gym to do cardio workouts. After a while I heard that cardio workout itself is not enough for weight loss. I had to to strengthen my muscles as well. I didn't know what to do and searching throughout internet for workouts which would be best for a beginner like me. At some point, I found sparkpeople.com, which is full of workout videos (and also hundreds of articles on healthy life style, food, exercises etc.). I watched several workout videos and loved the way that Coach Nicole teaches.
28 Day Boot Camp has a 28 day workout program, where you can start with short cardio workouts and gradually work more on muscles. I think this is perfect for a beginner. You can also mix and match any workouts you like in the DVD. You don't have to follow the program.

Exercise moves involve a variety of movement patterns that challenge strength, balance, and coordination, as well as incorporate cardio. Some simple equipment required, but one can manage with a mat or towel on the floor and filled water bottles as substitute for the dumbbells. More advanced individuals can make the exercises more challenging by following the modifications suggested, and by using heavier weights.

4847455,4,B005NGKJW0,"I do not like to exercise. But I am aware that it's necessary. I don't want to shell out money for a gym membership and I'm not a runner. I need to have some options for when I'm short on time. A friend recommended this DVD and I thought I'd give it a shot. I have followed the initial 28-day ""boot camp"" plan and liked it as much as I can like any exercise regimen. I like that there are variations given for beginners and those more advanced. I like that there are some kickboxing aspects to a couple of the workouts and that it combines cardio and weights in most of the workouts. And I really like that I can choose a workout based on how much time I've got to devote to it. I can do a short 12-minute cardio routine, a 30-minute Total Body Challenge or the entire DVD for a 64-minute workout (or a number of other variations). Coach Nicole gives good cues and options for basic and more advanced viewers. She doesn't bark orders like some instructors and isn't overly perky either.

I do wish there were some way to combine a few workouts from the main menu to play together in the way that a couple of them are combined for some of the Boot Camp workouts but as far as I can tell, that's not an option. You have to choose each one individually, which isn't terrible but it does necessitate going back to the main menu in between workouts briefly. That's my only complaint, though.

Edit: I wanted to add that, as at least one other reviewer noted, this workout can be tough on your knees. There are A LOT of active lunges in these workouts. I started having some knee problems last month that worsened after I worked out with this DVD so I had to lay off for a bit. I haven't stopped using it but I do have to modify it to the point where I'm barely doing anything for some sections of the workout that are almost entirely dependent on lunges.",1369872000,,1849,4.235127478753541

4847457,5,B005NGKJW0,"Coach Nicole really delivers with this work out dvd.

In general, I dislike exercise videos. I get annoyed by cheesy routines that usually make me feel like a lunatic bouncing around my home office.  I get tired of the perky, fake attitudes of the instructors.

But this routine is different!!

This dvd gives me plenty of variety to keep me from getting bored. I can change up my routine whenever I want, and not feel like I'm messing up my exercise regimen. The flexibility keeps me motivated.

And Nicole's personality keeps me motivated, too! She comes across as down-to-earth and friendly, not condescending or aloof like I've seen on various different exercise videos.

I appreciate the different levels of challenge to choose from. You can start out with minimal exertion and work your way up to some very challenging moves.

Personally, I started seeing exciting results quickly. I was very out of shape after having two kids--not obese, and no one would have even called me fat, but I knew I wasn't looking or feeling the way I should.  Even just the warm-up routine bested me the first time I did it. At one point Nicole says, ""We're not working out yet,"" and I just groaned! But soon I noticed improvement, and with persistence, now I'm able to handle any of the routines without feeling like I'm dying. I am really proud of the results I'm seeing physically--toned muscles and decreased weight. But even more importantly, I'm excited about the major increase in energy and mood improvement I'm enjoying.

I can't say enough good about this dvd and sparkpeople in general. As a devoted reader of amazon reviews, I'm hoping this little review I've written will encourage you to meet your fitness goals using this dvd. I haven't been disappointed in the least.

What I started out needing to modify, I can now keep up with the normal versions with even a few advanced moves. I did the Total Body Workout today and it kicked my butt.

Coach Nicole is able to be spunky and enthusiastic at the same time she's telling you it's okay to go your own pace, and going my own pace is definitely something I need, because right now I can only dream of moving as fast as she does, especially when it's getting up and down.  No matter how many times I work out with this DVD, I work up a sweat.

4847486,5,B005NGKJW0,"I'm finishing up Week 4..

First of all, I definitely have not gotten bored with the 28-day plan! I started with the lowest-impact and by Week 4, I find myself doing almost all intermediate and some of the advanced moves. Speaking of which, I'd like to sincerely thank the creators for providing 3 levels of difficulty for just about everything in the videos. Some moves I can easily do the advanced, others I'm SO grateful for the beginner moves!  I've had issues with my knees and hips, but as long as I make sure to use good form and perform the most appropriate moves based on my fitness level, there is no problem or pain.  (And DO NOT skip the cool down or you WILL hurt later.)

I am also a Sparkpeople.com member and I stick w/ my Spark plan of eating and other cardio, so I am seeing some results in weight loss and loss in inches. And I'm definitely noticing increased strength.

Workouts - even the longer combined ones - go quick. You're never waiting too long for the next move and I love when multiple moves are combined to really make the time pass fast! My favorite part of all the workouts is the kickboxing/martial arts jab-cross-hook-step-kick section...makes me use my brain as well as my body. I wouldn't mind doing less squats - but I wouldn't mind eating less broccoli too. Point is, they work and they're good for you even if they are not the most fun.  (Exercise is called ""working out"" for a reason.)  Another plus is that Coach Nicole is positive - in all of her videos - without being pushy, gives good instruction, and gives good reminders to breathe and to STAY at the level you are comfortable with.

This is a program that's easy to stick to because it can be modified.  These are good workouts that you can push hard without killing yourself.  I'm looking forward to doing another 28 days and seeing if I can work up to more of the advanced moves!",1341273600,6,1880,4.438953488372093

Coach Nicole is easy to follow and I feel like I was working out with friends, not impossible models. The routines are challenging, but the modifications provided are great for beginners. You don't get bored doing the same thing over and over if you follow their 28 day plan, and the workouts get progressively longer as you go on, so your body is challenged the whole time.

I definitely recommend this DVD! I've already loaned it to my mom!",1341187200,7,688,4.3671875

I am also trying to follow a clean diet to help with the weight loss and toning. Coach Nicole makes exercising really fun, and her assistants in the video are real women, not some super thin cut models...so that makes me feel more confident that I can do the workouts. The workouts start out very do-able and she works you up to the challenging  moves very slowly and the warm ups are fun. I have been pleasantly surprised at how much I'm sweating at the end of a 22 minute workout...She knows her stuff, and I am able to stick with her instructions really well.

4847491,2,B005NGKJW0,"While I enjoy the sparkpeople website and all it offers, this video does not have the same punch. Coach Nicole performs the exercises too fast, which is dangerous when using a hand weight. She appears to use a 3 pound hand-weight for the sculpt exercises, which is fine, however does not perform enough reps throughout the exercise for those of us who can use a 5lb weight, so your muscles are not thoroughly challenged. What I found interesting is she does not tell you which muscles you are working and how those muscles function. I think it is important to briefly explain the physical (and mental) benefits of pushing a hand weight over your head and not just tell people to grab a dumb-bell and follow the movement. She quicky moves on to the next exercise with no stretching in between.

The Cardio segment is a joke and not challenging what-so-ever! Even when the exercise changes to TEMPO, your heart-rate does not elevate much. If I continue with this 28-day workout it would take me two-years to lose just 15 pounds!

The best home fitness trainer for sculpting your body at any level, in my opinion, is Cathe Friedrich. She focuses on your muscle fibers and explains to you which muscles you are working, how we use them everyday and stretches you after each exercise. Her moves are slow, controlled, precise and mostly, you feel challenged. I am going to purchase Cathe's home fitness DVDs and if you want to be challenged and educated about physical fitness, you'd do the same.",1337385600,7,1490,4.704980842911877

4847496,5,B005NGKJW0,I purchased this dvd because the price was right and I needed to add some variety to my workout.  I have completed the first 2 weeks of the bootcamp.  I found both the cardio and toning portions that I completed to be suprisingly challenging.  Some of the cardio moves were difficult to follow and there is a learning curve but I just kept moving even if I was struggleing with a specific move.  The toning porions are interval training so it provides a mix of cardio and strength training.  I love the 28 day callendar on the DVD and am excited to complete it.  I like that the people exercising are real people and that there is no infomercial promising that you will lose X amount of weight in X number of days.  This workout uses some of the same concepts as the insane programs on the infomercials but without all the hype and a much better price.,1335744000,6,852,4.3544303797468356

Her down-to-earth personality comes through and her instructions are easy to follow. She's very encouraging but not overly perky like some instructors can be! So I was happy to buy her first full-length exercise DVD. I really enjoy the format; the different segments make it easy to customize the length of your workout. I also like that there are three different levels for many of the exercises -- beginner, intermediate, and advanced -- so you can work your way up as you build strength, endurance and balance.

I tend to get bored with DVDs quickly and need to rotate them around quite a bit, but I think this one will be in my rotation for quite awhile.  I especially like the 30-minute full body challenge as it's different from anything else I've ever done. I am a veteran of exercise DVDs so it wasn't hard for me to follow along.

It is pretty easy to use and I believe you will see results if you follow the plan.  The moves in the videos are pretty basic too so you don't have to be up on the latest hip hop moves or a professional dancer to do them.  I would reccommend using 5 pound weights with it though.

It looks like a regular calender with 28 little boxes.  So, if you click the box for day 1, the cardio burst workout will appear for you to work out for about 22 minutes.

Here is the calender plan from day 1 to day 7.

Day 1  (22 minutes) Cardio burst
Day 2  (22 minutes) Short cardio-sculpt
Day 3  Rest (or cross train with another workout)
Day 4  (22 minutes) Cardio burst
Day 5  (22 minutes) Short cardio-sculpt
Day 6  Rest (or cross train with another workout)
Day 7  (22 minutes) Short cardio-sculpt

From day 8 to day 28, the workouts increase in intensity and variety.  Times are approximate for this above section.

~~~

If don't want to follow the calender, you may customize your own workouts from the following list.

Warm up (6:14)
Cardio burst (12:24)
Short cardio-sculpt (11:56)
Tone & burn (21:12)
Total body challenge (31:12)
Cool down (4:44)

You may also play all (87:42) to work out for about 88 minutes.

This DVD seems designed to help people lose weight, with modifications for beginners and intermediate.  This DVD is probably not intended for experienced exercisers.

For me, this was a basic, calm, easy, and almost sedate exercise workout when I did the ""play all"" workout which was about 88 minutes.  (I have been exercising for a long while).

Coach Nicole instructs and works with two other young ladies.  She explains clearly, with one lady showing the basic moves and another lady showing the more advanced moves.

A pair of light weights and a mat is needed for this DVD.

4847510,5,B005NGKJW0,"This is a great exercise DVD for all fitness levels, in my opinion. Nicole gives choices for each level, and you can start small and go more intense, etc. But the thing I like the most about this video, is that I can do the MOST in the shortest amount of time. She is very creative in using one move to stregthen a few muscles at a time. I like this because for me personally, being a full-time Mom of 2 active little boys, I've got to work out fast while I can!  ;)  I walk away after the workout, feeling like I worked many muscles simultaneously. I love that!!
One more positive point is that she gives you a 28 day workout plan, so you literally go to that screen on the DVD and press the day of your workout and it brings you right to it. That's another plus for busy exercisers...And if you don't like that, you can obviously make your own plan.
I don't have a con for this video, other than some might initially look at the DVD and think of it as simple(that is, before you do the workouts!) I will admit that it is not a high budget video in technology, but for what it lacks in that way it makes up for it by far in fitness technique. And I think that this is what most of us are looking for right??",1333497600,5,1208,4.029166666666667
4847511,5,B005NGKJW0,and I LOVE it! I can feel myself moving away from the beginner workout to the more moderate workout. I also love that for the whole video you can choose who to follow. So it is great for beginners and advanced people. The exercise plan included has been working perfectly for me. Great video from a great company!,1333411200,,313,4.413793103448276
4847512,5,B005NGKJW0,This is a great video to get started with exercise.  It not only starts out on a low level but increases your workout.  It is very easy to follow!  I am 64 years young and even I can do it.  It's a great buy!,1333324800,,208,3.659090909090909
4847513,5,B005NGKJW0,"I'd consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser-I do some Jillian Michaels, I do some running. I'm not hard core but I'm not a beginner.

That said - I really enjoyed this DVD.

Pros
Coach Nicole starts you out with a slowed down version of each move and then takes you up to speed. For the chronically uncoordinated and klutzy (aka me) I find that helpful as it gives me a chance to get my flow going before I try to ramp up the pace.

She does a great job showing different levels of modification for all the exercises. There's usually 3 different levels to work at.

Quick pacing-I'm not at all good at doing one exercise for a long time-I get bored, I get whiny. I have the attention span of a 3 year old. You move through things quickly enough that it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing forever.

Calendar format-if you're following the 28 day plan you just click on the day and it cues everything up for you-no messing with the menu or stopping to load up the next session.

Tracking-if you're a sparkpeople member and track your fitness minutes these are already inputted into the list and you just have to plug in the minutes you did-very quick and easy.

Coach Nicole-I just really like her-she's positive and encouraging without being sickeningly sweet. I think she does a great job of cuing and reminding you of the proper form (like the reminders to not let your shoulders creep up by your ears.) It helps me keep that good form throughout the workout.

Cons
Cardio-for me-at my fitness level I don't feel like the cardio is enough to really get my heart rate up. I tend to modify things - like when you do the burpees and speed skaters-instead of doing them at the slow pace I bust them out at full speed the whole time.

Footwork - some of the footwork is tricky. I'm not really coordinated and the box steps/diagonal steps stuff-there's a definite learning curve. Sometimes I try hard and follow along-other days-when the brain is cotton candy and I'm fumble footed I just do some jumping jacks and call it even. I like the challenge and I'm slowly getting better at it but it's not effortless.

Squats a lot-there's a lot of squats-they don't hurt my feelings but if you have knee issues they might hurt yours.

I've done a lot of Coach Nicole's free videos on Sparkpeople and basically bought this one because I like her freebies so much. Overall I'm really pleased with it-I find myself looking forward to doing it which isn't something I can say for a lot of videos. Frankly anything that gets me excited about a workout is worth 5 stars in my book.",1333152000,7,2583,4.474468085106383
4847514,3,B005NGKJW0,"I began the 28 day boot camp this morning and I knew I was in trouble before the warm-up was over. I am pretty active - I do at least 1 hour every day of some type of cardio (mostly Leslie Sansone or Zumba). However, I have had knee surgery on the right knee, torn cartilage on the left knee and a broken right knee. Coach Nicole seems partial to squats and lunges. While she says that your joints should be getting warm, my knees feel like they're on fire and the noise coming from the left knee can't be good. Even trying to follow the modified version doesn't work. I would not recommend this workout for anyone who has chronic knee issues. Otherwise, I believe it would be a highly effective workout for anyone with good knees.",1332892800,34,731,4.304347826086956

4847516,5,B005NGKJW0,"Simply put, this DVD is great for all fitness levels. I am personally between a beginner to intermediate exercising level. Probably about 80% of my strength lies in my legs and I can tell you my legs were feeling the burn after the 12-minute Short Cardio Sculpt workout. Yes, it doesn't have all the 'bells & whistles' but that doesn't make it a bad DVD. Coach Nichole keeps you moving and your body burning. I recommend you to not only check out this DVD but Sparkpeople.com as well for up-to-date information regarding nutrition, health issues, recipes and trackers (nutrition, food, fitness and measurements). You can't go wrong with this. :)",1331683200,2,645,4.872727272727273

Coach Nicole made sure that it was varied and have 3 levels of workout ability in each routine. I believe that doing this program helped me get stronger and I lost some weight also.

If I had to rate it I would give it 4.5 stars (lost a 1/2 star because of those dang burpees!) and I would recommend this to anyone - beginner or experienced. I want to mix it up for a few weeks, but I plan to do this again in a month and use a little heavier weight or focus doing more of the things Lindsay does.",1329955200,4,697,3.874125874125874
4847518,5,B005NGKJW0,"I am a member of the Spark Community for 4+ years now, and I love Coach Nicole's videos - I have them all.  I was so excited to hear that a bootcamp video was coming out, as I love trying to complete the Spark Official 28-Day Bootcamps that are held online in the Spark community.

At first I thought this DVD would only be bootcamp videos (which would have alone made me happy), but then I put the DVD in and hit ""play"".

First of all, there are options! Yes, you can have your cake and eat it too. You can follow the 28-day plan which is in a cool calendar format (for those literal people like me), or you can pick from different timed segments - 12, 20 and 30 minute workouts. GREAT for busy moms like me, too.

I love that the cardio plus the boot-camp style circuit training burns more fat in less time (again, busy mom here!)

I LOVE the cardio intervals.

There are three different intensity levels so you just pick your own speed and go with it.

I really enjoyed the 30-Minute Challenge Routine. This is like one of those combos at a Mexican restaurant. It's all in there and it's all so GOOD! Not just curls and squats, this mixture of cardio and ST will have your heart thumping and your body rocking. My husband did this one with me and he was dying! I had to encourage him to keep going.

The other women in the video do modify for you, too. The girl on the right is a lower intensity. I've read some reviews saying that beginners can't do it, but my hubby is a beginner and he was fine with the modifications - and a little reassurance from me.

Get your copy today, your body will love you for it.",1329696000,2,1613,4.17741935483871
4847519,5,B005NGKJW0,"I have really enjoyed adding this workout DVD to my rotation.  The instructor is easy to follow, with cueing being right on the mark.  I like that you are shown three different levels so that you can modify as necessary.  I recommend following the 28 day plan laid out for you.",1329350400,2,277,4.392156862745098
4847520,4,B005NGKJW0,"I had the opportunity to try this DVD as a free giveaway from SparkPeople.com and then offer my review/thoughts. As a relatively fit person (been exercising consistently 3-6 times per week since April 2010), I found a combination workout of the Cardio Blast and Tone & Burn to be a decent workout, although not as intense as other fitness DVDs I have tried. The warm-up portion didn't really get me ""warm"" so much, so I will probably stick to jogging in place or a few jumping jacks to get warm rather than marching in place to begin. Some of the moves were a bit challenging to follow at first (a little mamba/salsa dance steps thrown in, but not many) but easy to get the hang of for the most part. For absolute beginners (going from ZERO exercise experience), I would suggest watching a few of the segments before actually trying to hop in with your first workout; watching and trying to follow the footsteps slowly will make the experience more enjoyable when you're ready to break a sweat. For more seasoned (especially at-home DVD watchers or aerobic class-goers) exercisers, you should be able to get a grasp of the movements relatively quickly.

The DVD is nicely organized, and Coach Nicole is very pleasant and encouraging, and demonstrates ALL the exercises (and continues them all the way, which can be rare in these types of DVDs). It offers some great options for beginner to intermediate exercisers, but probably would not prove to be a very intense or challenging workout DVD for most advanced athletes or people looking for a dramatic program. The ""start slow"" aspect with simpler modifications fits very well in the overall mission of SparkPeople, to help people adjust and build long-term healthy habits in their lives. For those with well-established habits, it can be a nice fall-back option for at home workouts, but probably not a main-game for improving fitness if you are already fit.",1329091200,3,1909,4.837920489296636
4847521,5,B005NGKJW0,This DVD really delivers a great workout! I love that it has so many options. Short on time? That's ok. You can select a specific workout based on how much time you have. Want to do the 28 day challenge? The DVD offers a calendar and you can select the workout for that day. You can also do a 30 minute challenge which is great! I love that Coach Nicole starts with a move at a low intensity and then modifies it to be a higher intensity. That way you get the gist of the move before the intensity is raised. She is really easy to follow which is also very helpful. This DVD has options for all fitness levels? In great shape? Use heavier hand weights and add in jumps. Just starting out? That's fine too. Some of the workouts use hand weights and some don't. Just user a lighter weight and don't had in the hopping and jumping. You can make this fit your fitness level.,1328832000,2,870,4.184523809523809

The moves got me sweating, however the cardio didn't get my heart rate going as much as I would have liked.  I felt like she spent too much time on the ""boxing"" moves which allowed for too much rest.  The moves can be a little confusing, especially if you're uncoordinated like I am.

4847524,5,B005NGKJW0,"Hi all!

I wanted to post a review for you of the new SparkPeople DVD - Coach Nicole's 28 Day Boot Camp.

First of all, let me say that I think its pretty awesome that SP would want members to try out workout videos and post what they think. They know we are an opinionated bunch...so to request our honest opinions is a pretty honorable move if you ask me.

I was excited to try out Coach Nicole's new video. I had not watched any of her videos before, but had heard about them.

Here is what I LOVED about the DVD:

*Coach Nicole's voice is not annoying - she is very calm, even tempered, did not yell at me (like some trainers) and seemed to enjoy the workout herself. She even did just about the whole thing, which you almost never see.

*I saw some moves I had not seen in workout videos before that were very good. I have bunches, I mean bunches of at home workout videos. Everything from Leslie Sansone to Weight Watchers walking to Billy Blanks Tae Bo and Biggest Loser. I liked seeing somethings I had not seen before and it was an unexpected surprise.

*Good music, not too distracting, and pleasant, happy looking participants.

To put my review in fair perspective, I've lost 101 pounds total on my journey (since August 2009). I started out by just walking, but today my workout schedule today looks like this:

Sunday: 3-4 mile run
Monday: 2 mile run plus 1 hour Zumba (gym/studio)
Tuesday: interval run in the morning
Wednesday: 1 hour Zumba, 1 hour Boot Camp (gym/studio)
Thursday: rest day
Friday: 3-4 mile run
Saturday: 45 min workout video (Tae Bo or Biggest Loser with weights) plus 2-4 mile run

That said, I'm pretty active. I tried out a few different workouts on this DVD, and thought they were good, but overall a little light on the intensity for me and the amount of sweat I need to burn the calories I need to burn to reach my goal (another 25 pounds to lose).

THIS DVD IS PERFECT FOR YOU: If you are just starting out, or have any issues with knees, ankles, hips, anything that keeps you from working out super intensely like I do. If you are recovering from an injury, or at the starting line, then this would be the perfect video for you. It has a good plan attached to it to take you through 28 days, and there are even some workouts that can be done in just a few minutes when time is short. New Sparkers should definitely give it a try!!!

I will definitely use different parts of this DVD in the future, as I do like variety and enjoyed Coach Nicole's presentation of the workouts very much.

Hey, fyi, SparkPeople members will get 250 SparkPoints for buying your DVD at Target stores, and you can get a $3 off Target coupon at [...]

I received this DVD for free from SparkPeople and did not receive any form of payment for my review.

4847525,5,B005NGKJW0,"I hate most exercise DVDs but this one saved my exercise routine from winter weariness.
I normally run outside but stopped with the cold.  This DVD is a great option for me to use instead and offers a great way to build in strength work as well as cardio.
There are two reasons I would suggest this DVD versus others available -
First the options to mix and match workouts and use it to build up to a full intense workout.
Second is Coach Nicole's personable style.  She and the two other trainers make it seem like you are working out with them in your own home instead of with polished, perfect, pretty people.  Don't get me wrong Coach Nicole is very pretty but in this DVD she's a reachable professional.  Yippee, now I run, bike, workout with Coach Nicole and walk my dog Mac.  Having an option that includes strength training is a boon to my intention to be hale, hearty and healthy!",1328140800,,889,4.396341463414634
4847526,5,B005NGKJW0,"I really enjoyed Coach Nicole's 28 Day Boot Camp DVD.  The routines were pretty easy to follow.  I am pretty much out of shape, only doing some walking, and so I found the workouts challenging.  However the adaptations really helped!

The music is not obtrusive.  It has a decent beat but it is not loud or overpowering.  The set is not distracting (I wish I had such a wide area to work out in).  I just love the trainers.  Coach Nicole leads the workouts and does the intermediate level.  On the left is Lindsay, so does the higher level and on the right is Jewel, who does the lower level.  I really appreciated having Jewel demonstrate adaptations for the routines where I could not keep up with Coach Nicole.  I didn't feel bad because I couldn't keep up.

I really like the fact that there is a clock in right hand corner that counts down each routine.  It helped to know how much longer there was - when it was really hard I felt like ""I can do this for just 4 more minutes"".  I think without the timer I would have quit on some of the routines before they were done.

I guess this might not be intense enough for hardcore exercise DVD users, but I found it really challenging but not to the point where I felt like quitting.  I really like the fact that you can mix up the workouts and choose shorter ones on days when you don't have a lot of time but still want to get in a workout.  I think it would be a good workout for the ""lighter"" days for those at the highest levels.

I would recommend it for anyone!",1328054400,2,1517,4.190311418685121
4847527,4,B005NGKJW0,"I really like this video for variety and ease of use.  Pop it in, choose a day, and it plays all the videos that are associated with that day.  You can choose to follow the 28-Day Plan, or do the segments separately on their own.  Knocking off a star only because it's not as hardcore of a workout as a Zumba or Pilates class that you would get at a gym, but for an at-home option, it's a really decent use of your time and burn potential.

The package also contains a couple of other workout segments from other people published by the same DVD company that are useful, and some great recipes from the new SparkPeople Cookbook.",1328054400,3,628,4.296610169491525

4847529,5,B005NGKJW0,"This is a great workout DVD to add to my collection. The DVD contains a total of 84 minutes of workout set up as follows:

a. 6 minute warm up
b. 12 minute cardio blast
c. 12 minute strength and cardio
d. 20 minute tone and burn
e. 20 minute Total Body Challenge
f. 4 minute cool down

Further, the DVD lets you select the workout or workouts you want to do, but it also has a 28 day pre-planned workout that you can follow. I enjoyed the workouts because there were fun, and there are 3 levels shown for each exercise which made it fairly easy to do each workout, but also provided more challenge for later on. The format setting with the 3 trainers made it easy to follow whichever level you want to work out at.

I enjoyed the variety of the workouts and the exercise modifications. The variety and modifications are a great way to incorporate exercise into your schedule even if you have only 22 minutes, yet it gives you the flexibility to combine the workouts so that you can do a longer workout if you wish and have the time. Also, the exercise modifications allow you to continue using this DVD for a longer period of time while continuing to strengthen your body by doing the more challenging version.

I think following the 28-day Boot Camp plan included on the DVD, or any other combination of the workouts on the DVD, will help people get good results.

My favorite aspect of the DVD was the wide variety of workouts available by combining the different exercises as well as the varying levels of each exercise.",1327881600,4,1523,4.425
4847530,5,B005NGKJW0,"I absolutely love this DVD! The exercises are easy, but work. I workout almost every day and even 22 minutes of this DVD (Day 1 of 28 Day Program) made my legs sore. The studio is beautiful and cozy (it looks like a large apartment living room) and the girls are so ""normal"" looking, opposed to other women you see on exercise DVDs who look like they work out for hours and hours a day. Each move is modifiable and each exercise shows you Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced versions. I'm so glad I added this DVD to my repetoire and I would definitely recommend this to use alone, or to supplement.",1327881600,3,600,4.414414414414415
4847531,5,B005NGKJW0,"I thought I was an intermediate exerciser.  Coach Nicole has set me straight.  She gives you choices to make your exercises tougher and also to pick what you want to do that day.  I am not following her 28-day plan because I am currently already in a plan, but I am definitely considering switching after using a couple of her workouts as fill-ins for rainy days when I can't walk.  She will make you feel like you exercised.
I would recommend this for a beginning exerciser that is looking to ramp up their exercise strength.  Some moves are quite hard, but she does everything in steps and often lets you know at what point, how many more current reps, before it changes.  That helps you keep up with her.
I would also recommend this dvd for advanced exercisers, as the moves are challenging and varied.
The background trainers are easy to follow as well with them doing the easier and the harder versions of each set of moves.
Kudos to Coach Nicole and her easy to follow, well articulated workouts.
I must add that I was chosen to use and review this dvd free of charge and I am not being paid by anyone to do so.",1327622400,2,1117,4.371980676328502
4847532,5,B005NGKJW0,"I started using this DVD  right after Christmas. I took my measurements and stepped on the scale on January 1st wanting to commit to making this year the year I adopt a consistent workout schedule. Since experts say a new habit can be formed in 21-28 days I opted to follow Coach Nicole's 28 Day Bootcamp plan.

A few minutes into my first 'warmup'..I realized just how out of shape I was! Even though she said this was 'not the exercise portion but ONLY a warmup, it felt like a full exercise session to me! Still, I pressed on and completed Day one and made up my mind to complete the entire 28 Days Bootcamp.

In addition to Coach Nicole who I assume is doing an 'intermediate' level workout, there are two other ladies you can choose to follow. One is doing modified steps and exercises and the other ADVANCED!....Well, I had to modify things even further to keep up at times but this is what I like about this program. You can easily simply march in place if you are unable to follow steps or do a certain exercise then jump back in when you can.

There are any number of ways to personalize this program and it has the added bonus of online support at Sparkpeople.com!

I plan to keep using this DVD at least until I am able to complete a full 28 day cycle keeping up with Coach Nicole. I highly recommend this to anyone at any fitness level!

P.S. Since Jan 1, I have lost 4 lbs and 5 inches overall!!!

4847534,5,B005NGKJW0,"I started using this DVD just after Christmas and I absolutely love it. I especially like all the different options you have for working out. You can follow their 28-day plan or you can choose from all the different workouts to create your own plan for cardio and strength training. You also have options within each workout to take the exercises to a more difficult level or to stay at an easier level until you're ready for a more challenging workout. This is so nice as I've bought DVD's in the past that were too difficult for my fitness level. The best part is that I'm already starting to feel results. I love to hike for exercise, and in the few weeks I've been using it I am already becoming a stronger hiker. It is definitely helping to strengthen my quads and hamstrings allowing me to sail uphill and downhill with greater ease than I have in many years. I went hiking with my 28 year old son this morning who was impressed with how much stronger I've become. Thank you Spark People and Coach Nicole for a wonderful DVD!",1327363200,4,1031,4.431578947368421

Coach Nicole starts out with a beginners modification and she tells you when you feel you are ready you can progress to the intermediate, and when you are ready move to the next level, the advanced workout. It is all up to you. You always see a person in this DVD demonstrating your fitness level in the DVD.

The total workout is 84 minutes but you get to pick and choose if you want to do the entire workout or just a few components. The components consist of a 6 min. warm up, 12 min. Cardio Burst, 12 min. Cardio Sculpt, 20 min. Tone and Burn, 30 min. Total Body Challenge, and a 4 min. cool down.",1327363200,3,703,4.169117647058823

Each one is presented with three different intensity levels and exercise modifications; therefore, it's simple to customize your workout for your specific fitness level while also making it work with your time schedule. Also, the only equipment needed is a pair of hand weights and a mat. In addition, the DVD includes a warm-up and cool-down segment.

The DVD workouts are enjoyable and easy to follow, but also sufficiently challenging. Each workout segment is different, rather than being just longer versions of the same thing. Also, it helps that the trainers are energetic and encouraging too.

Though her movements may seem simple, she definately gets you moving.  With the customizable plan, you can choose from a 28-day plan or 12, 20 or 30 minute segments. With 3 intensity levels, you are able to exercise at your own personal level.  I have been using the 28-Day Boot Camp video for the last 3 weeks, along with healthy eating, and have lost 10 pounds. Try it...stick with it...and you will be pleased!",1327276800,4,554,4.924731182795699
4847538,2,B005NGKJW0,"Background info: I am a certified group fitness instructor, but have always gravitated towards teaching strength classes/spinning as opposed to highly choreographed classes. This is also the first fitness DVD of this type that I have EVER done in 11+ years of exercising, with the exception of P90X and various yoga videos. Used 10 pound dumbbells.

Warmup: I could not do the high impact version of any of the exercises, due to sleeping people in my house. I liked the dynamic strength moves, but the aerobics moves did not get my heart rate up one bit. Normally when I work out, I do not warm up at all so this was a change for me.

Tone & Burn: Perhaps it was the heavier (relatively speaking - in my gym workouts I use barbells and dumbbells between 18-100 pounds) weights I was using, but the pace was far too fast to perform the moves in a controlled manner. So I did a few less reps than prescribed. One of the ""secrets"" that I learned as a group fitness instructor is that unfortunately you have to assume that participants are never going to use weights challenging enough (or appropriate weights simply are not available) so in order to counter that, the instructor has to do high reps in order to get something out of the workout. My biceps are burning. I don't do bicep curls or any other isolation exercises regularly, and this workout was full of isolation work and I felt it was a little too heavy on the bicep curls and therefore somewhat unbalanced. The ""compound"" moves were difficult to follow - again, possibly due to my heavier weights and the fact that I am simply unaccustomed to moves like that, I prefer basic compound exercises, low reps, heavy weight. I followed the beginner level and still had trouble completing all the reps. For someone with an extremely high level of cardiovascular fitness, the ""cardio bursts"" didn't get my heart rate up in the least, however, I did not add in the high impact moves.

Cooldown: mirrored the warmup. Good job stretching all the major muscle groups, I wished each stretch was held a bit longer.

I would recommend this workout for intermediate exercisers, who don't have heavier weights available, but I think you'd get more results learning to use heavier weights/low reps/compound exercises. I personally did not like this DVD, due to the fact that what I know works well for me is completely the opposite of the exercises presented in the DVD.",1327104000,9,2412,4.681603773584905
4847539,5,B005NGKJW0,"Coach Nicole makes it very easy to follow along, giving warning before changing moves (unlike many other DVD instructors I've seen).  I'm able to follow along without getting flustered when something changes.  But that doesn't mean this is an easy workout; it challenges me and makes me sweat!",1326931200,2,293,5.083333333333333
4847540,5,B005NGKJW0,"I really love it...it has a good variety of aerobics and at different intensity levels that you can follow. From step in place to mat work and even the use of dumbells. Easy to follow along with and Coach Nicole has a great video presence, as do the other 2 women. You feel like you are with some good friends having fun while exercising! For those with bad knees like I have, it is manageable-that is why I like to follow along with Jewel who does the beginners level. They even include some good recipes from the new cookbook from Sparkpeople and other bonus features! You can also get access to free meal plans and Sparkpeople.com's online boot camp club!
Highly reccommend.",1326672000,4,677,4.557377049180328
4847541,5,B005NGKJW0,"I would consider myself an ""advanced exerciser"" I feel I can also benefit from this DVD - I can do the high impact version and it's still a fun workout - and I can sure use some toning in just the right places.  I saw a lot of the basic, fundamental exercises being performed on this DVD  - YES, basics and fundamentals do WORK !!!!  And I won't lie.... my thighs were pretty sore the day after (I haven't work those muscle groups in a while), which means I did it right, lol.

I recommend this DVD to everyone - get yours today, and share with your friends.  It can easily be added into your current fitness routine or it can be used as a solitary program, your choice.

A great workout for the beginner as well as the advanced fitness guru's.",1326672000,4,744,4.204225352112676
4847542,5,B005NGKJW0,"Lovelovelove this dvd. I've always been intimidated by other workout dvds due to the models - I mean instructors - as well as their seemingly endless energy and shouting.

In Coach Nicole's DVD, all of the instructors are beautiful and fit, but still look like real women I can relate to and not feel intimidated by. They represent 3 different workout levels so you can follow along at your own pace and have an instructor to watch who is doing it right there with you so you don't feel like you're being left behind by a dvd.

The workouts are fun and the choreography isn't too complicated. You may get tripped up the first or second time on any workout, but that's to be expected. Just keep moving and catch up when you're ready! Would definitely recommend.",1326585600,6,760,4.54014598540146
4847543,5,B005NGKJW0,"These workouts can be followed individually, meaning that you can choose from each individual workout, or you can follow the 28 day plan, which includes alternating cardio and toning as well as rest days. There is an interactive calendar in the DVD menu that you can click on if you are following the 28 day plan. It's a great feature to have.

It's a great program for anyone starting out or those looking to add variety to their existing workout program. Coach Nicole's cues are easy to follow and encouraging. Certainly, it may take time to get used to some of the moves but I think that after the second or third time you will feel comfortable. It is also a very effective program. I am not new to exercising but was looking for something that provided a good workout. I also run, do pilates and yoga, dance, and try other activities as part of a healthy lifestyle. This is a great addition to my routines and I'll be using the cardio and circuit training to get a quick and efficient workout.

SparkPeople.com is a great, free website that provides support for anyone looking for food tracking (customized calorie recommendations), fitness ideas and trackers, and motivation. Coach Nicole is the resident fitness expert and she will answer questions on the team message boards for the 28 day bootcamp. What other fitness program offers that feature?",1326153600,3,1354,4.757446808510639
4847544,5,B005NGKJW0,"I have been a fan of [...] for over 2 years. The community and website were instrumental in my losing over 80 pounds. I am an avid user of workout DVD's. Most of my collection are FIRM workouts bought over the years. I decided to try Coach Nicole's DVD to shake things up a bit. Although I consider myself intermediate/advanced, this workout was a challenge! I cannot believe how sore I was the next day. There are some interesting moves that are just slightly different from what I'd been doing... that difference MADE a difference.

I love being able to work at my own fitness level. Some of the moves I did with Nicole (intermediate) and others I did with the other two cast members (advanced and beginner). I tried to push myself to the advanced level, but it was nice to be able to drop back when I needed to.

As others have said, it is also nice to see real women working out. DVD's with extremely cut and/or skeletal cast members intimidate me. I love the healthy, fit women in 28-Day Boot Camp!

The cueing is excellent. Coach Nicole always counts down to a new move after explaining it, and I like the add-on style. You do a basic move first, then add more components.

I highly recommend this DVD. First-time exercisers may want to preview it first, but anyone who has done a workout DVD will be able to jump right in and get up to speed pretty quickly. I look forward to progressing with this DVD and moving up to heavier weights as I do to keep it challenging!",1326067200,18,1473,4.384615384615385

And when one level gets too easy, guess what, it doesn't stop there--there's another challenge waiting to be achieved. So if you don't have time to travel to the gym, pop this in to the DVD player and you are one step closer to AWESOMENESS!",1325894400,6,597,4.245614035087719

There are far too many great DVD's out there for less money, offering much more motivation with moves & exercises that will challenge the body-mind-as well as give the incentive to look forward to doing the DVD another day.

I have bought many different exercise tapes through the years, but this is one of the most organized and clear programs I have seen.  There are several great features about it.  Foremost, Coach Nicole's instructions are crystal clear, and easy to follow. She has a very pleasant voice, and is very positive, which is very motivating rather than intimidating. There are several levels of difficulty demonstrated during the same exercise, so that one can follow at the level best for them.  The clock in the bottom right hand corner is very motivating.  It feels great to watch the time tick by, knowing that you are almost through the workout.  The warmup and cooldown segments are excellent.  Once I get more familiar with all the exercises, I plan to listen to music while doing the workout. There is music on the DVD, but it is softly playing in the background. I look forward to doing the workout each evening, and then being able to track it on my Fitness Tracker on the Spark People website.  The tracker tells you exactly how many calories you burned, and keeps a tally going for the week.  Being able to complete the workout and log it on the website encourages me to work towards fulfilling my weight loss and fitness goals.

4847552,5,B005NGKJW0,"This review is based on my first 6 six days.  Day 7 begins tomorrow ... WooHoo!

I am loving this 28-Day Bootcamp!  This is what I wrote about my Day 1 experience on Sparkpeople.com ""This was a little tougher than I thought, but a very good workout! Although I will admit the warm could be a workout [in] itself. I had to be careful with the grapevine/mambo turns as I was working out on carpet, so the turns were a bit of a challenge.  I like the idea of clicking the day on the calendar that takes you to the workout. I originally thought I had to click the warm/workout/cool down separately. Nice feature.""

I disagree with one of the posts that this dvd is not for beginners.  Beginners can follow this fitness routine - Jewel, featured on the right, does an excellent job at the modifying the moves. And the moves can be modified even more.  I have a shoulder/back injury so I'm limited with some of the moves.  If you have never done a particular move before, of course it will seem difficult at first, but keep going, keep moving.  If you find that you have two left feet, take your time, you WILL get it. If you work out on carpet, the mambo turns will be a challenge or just don't turn. I weigh 219, and consider myself an advanced beginner/intermediate exerciser.

I have nothing negative to say about this dvd.  Coach Nicole's positive attitude upbeat attitude keeps you going and her cuing is excellent. The 28-Day Calendar is by far, the best feature I've seen - well structured!  More fitness dvds should be like this.  Just click and your right where you need to be to get started!

And Ditto on Exercise Junkie's review ....

EDITED TO ADD:
EDITED - On 1/28/2012 I completed the 28-Day Boot Camp dvd. I am happy to report that I successfully met my two goals.

The first was committing to ALL 28 days. Other than adding in a little cardio on rest days - I accomplished what I set out to do from the start, complete the program - no excuses, no distractions.

My second goal, which was to release 5 lbs.  I was super excited when I finished Day 28 - the feeling that I accomplished is beyond words - it was a great feeling.

Sunday morning, 1/29/2012 - I stepped on the scale for my final weigh-in.
Start Weight - 219.4
Goal Weight 214
End Weight - 213.8
TOTAL RELEASED - 5.6LBS WooHoo! I did it I did it!!!

Although I did not take measurements, I can definitely feel a difference in my clothes. They fit just right, not snug or hug my body like before starting bootcamp.

Coach Nicole was easy to follow and her cuing was superb. I teetered between watching Jewel for modifications and toward the end of the 28 days I would try a few of the advanced moves. I was aiming for Progress NOT perfection.

Currently I am following another program for cardio, but incorporating the 28-day boot camp strength training. Although the strength training kicked my butt, it was just what the doctor ordered. I can see the definition in my arms and legs. Thanks Sparkpeople, Coach Nicole, Linsey and Jewel ... you ROCK!

I'm sure that most people look forward to the last day of any boot camp and I'll admit I was, but I am looking forward to Round 2 in March!",1325808000,100,3163,4.396907216494846
