8283959,4,B001934SQO,"This is one of the better psychological horror films I have seen in a while. It is good, because it doesn't take itself to seriously. Alteast that is the feeling I got. There is some funny moments, but some really good jumps. Not a ton of gore, but enough. The acting was good as well. I was into it. You should check it out.",1223942400,,325,4.09375

8283961,3,B001934SQO,"Good Horror has been lacking the last few years being that we are in the age of remakes, but this low budget horror film had some meat to it. I give the filmmakers credit for trying to do something a bit different and succeeding. There was a colorful feel to the beginning which became darker and darker until horror overtook the film. It was very interesting. The descention from suburbia to horror. The cinematography was good and the acting was decent for this kind of film. Could have maybe been a bit better, but this was not drama. Compared to most horror the actors deserve an academy award. There was some good scares and I agree that the film does leave you thinking. Some may not like that, but i did. Peace.",1223856000,,718,4.446969696969697
8283962,4,B001934SQO,"Grabbed this film on the urging of a friend of mine and I have to say that I was glad I did. It has everything, good script, creepy ambiance, fine acting, trippy scenes, gore, heart pounding scares and a TWIST i never saw coming. Check it out this film is a bit different that most horror films, leaves ya thinkin, but good nonetheless!",1223683200,,336,4.349206349206349
