8650556,1,B00JFH8HM2,"This documentary is terrible. It's just bad cgi, a bunch of stock footage, and ADD editing. It's supposed to show a ""shark battlefield"" off some Pacific island, but shows footage from the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, the eastern tropical Pacific, the Bahamas, and South Africa. It even shows fish lice in a little cgi clip as some kind of insect, even though they're parasitic crustaceans that don't look anything like the animal they depicted.",1491177600,,446,5.123287671232877
