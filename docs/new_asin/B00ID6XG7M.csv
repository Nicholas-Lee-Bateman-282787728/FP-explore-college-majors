8640987,5,B00ID6XG7M,"I love movies from the 50s so much anyway.  I saw this movie with legendary buxom bombshell Jane Russell and Hunkier than Hunky Jeff Chandler many years ago and it has remained one of my absolute favorites.  What's not to like, there is eye candy from both leads that you don't often see in today's movies, an interesting plot, a sexy love story that will keep you entertained from start to finish.  I recommend this movie highly for romance lovers and movies made in Hollywood's Golden Era with  actors that could honestly be called stars.  Watch it on a Friday or Saturday night when the house is quite.  Curl up on the couch with a throw across your curled up legs while holding a big bowl of hot popcorn and prepare to be entertained.",1393200000,6,738,4.470149253731344
