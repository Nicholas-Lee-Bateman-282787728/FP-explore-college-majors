It bothered me that all the scenes where there were windows they covered them with black drapes. I couldn't figure out what the deal was, but I guess it was a matter of lighting during the filming of all indoor scenes. The acting of many of these actors looked stiff, fake, weird. I felt at one time that the most natural while acting was the waitress in a restaurant scene.

However, the plot is good, the idea is good, and they still pull it off ok. The fact that this lesbian woman gets all these ladies to read the novel she picks and get involved in it is good. They open their minds to new horizons, while they get in touch with their own sexualities, fantasies, etc. You can also get a glimpse of what intolerance and double moral principles looks like in a small town or city. The ending seemed to me possible, but unlikely to happen. At least in my perspective. It's deffinitely not one of the best lesbian movies I've seen. There are many great lesbian films out there, but it's ok if you want to spend some time watching this kind of films. It's the kind of movie I would have rented instead of buying, but it wasn't that expensive either so I don't regret spending that money. And I think it's good to see what is being done out there with this subject, good, not so good, and even bad movies.",1268179200,2,1449,4.2690909090909095

I wasn't expecting much when I first ran across the title.  No big names, no real budget, probably just another wanna be film maker with a video camera.  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.

The story revolves around the out and proud, Kate (the lovely Cicely Mendoza) and her straight crush, Hannah (Jami Horner).  Kate has fallen for Hannah, but isn't willing to make the first move.  She'd rather stay friends then get rejected.

The real fun begins when Hannah invites Kate to join her book club.  Pushed to suggest a new title for the club to read, Kate suggests a period piece without mentioning the book is about a lesbian pirate named Raven.

My personal highlights from the movie included- The book store scenes when the ladies of the book club went to purchase the book.  Kate's blind dates.  The bar scene when I realized that Kate's feelings for Hannah might actually be reciprocated.

So give this little independent flick a try.  You'll like it!",1226793600,7,1014,4.661016949152542
