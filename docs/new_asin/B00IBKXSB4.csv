6256586,5,B00IBKXSB4,"This wonderful two-disc DVD set on the Athena Video imprint (distributed by RLJ) is a must watch program for anyone who loves live theater and essential for anyone who is involved in theatre arts, whether an actors, stage manager, usher or the carpenter who builds the sets. Its a brilliant project conceived by writer, director and, yes, cameraman Chris Terrill, in which Terrill followed a 2009 production of Samuel Becketts Waiting For Godot at the historic Royal Haymarket Theatre in Londons West End (built in 1720!), which sold out all 192 performances and is the most successful production of the play, from the rehearsals through the closing night. The cast was a dream cast of British actors with Sir Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart as the leads and Simon Callow and Ronald Pickup (plus four young boys  each rotating through a role) filling out the cast.  Terrill is also there as the next production at the theatre (also directed by Sean Mathias) begins rehearsals and opens a month after WFG leaves the theater. That play was a stage version of Truman Capotes Breakfast at Tiffanys starring Anna Friel and Joseph Cross. (Terrill says many times in his narration that this was the first stage version of BAT but, in fact, there was a musical version, titled Holly Golightly that was staged in 1966 but closed after just four performances on Broadway. I was able to see that in its out-of-town tryout in Philadelphia.).
What makes this series of eight episodes  each running a fast-moving 25 minutes  that aired on SkyTV arts network  in the UK so interesting is that Terrill is holding the camera at all times and asks the right questions of whoever he is filming, whether it be the actors, the creative team or  my favorites  the father and daughter team of plumbers who are renovating the rest rooms in the theater and need to get it done before the opening. Oh yes, then there is the new female usher (an aspiring actress) who is captured as she is assigned to serve intermission tea to Dame Maggie Smith. Another wonderful moment of many.

You don't need to know much about Waiting For Godot either  though I learned a lot. Terrill, and even the actors in the play  oh, did I mention the understudy who sits night after night waiting for his turn?-  admit that  the play is ambiguous and hard to understand.  Theres even a lively original score to the series that keeps things moving.

I could go on and on about the wonderful moments but that would spoil the fun.  Ill add a few more comments about the set and an update on the story. The DVD package includes a nice 12-page Viewers Guide which was written in 2014 that gives some background on the London theaters and major productions, though there is a major error in the authors attributing the hit musical Les Miserables to Andrew Lloyd Webber.  (He wrote many shows but not Les Mis.). There are also brief bios of the actors and the creative team of the two shows profiled in the series. What is odd is that there is no bio or info about filmmaker Terrill, something I would have liked.) Its also noted in the Guide that the production of Godot did not, in fact, end in London. The same cast took it to the US in 2014 and it is actually closing the week that Im posting this review.

I was able to receive an advance screen or this DVD from the distributor and it will not be released until May 13, 2014. But I urge every theater lover and educator to seek out this package (it can be pre-ordered). It belongs in every High School or University theater department library and may be the best , and certainly the most entertaining, course on the theater arts ever produced. It took five years to get to home video release.  But now its here for all to see and enjoy.
I hope you found this review both informative and Helpful.

6256587,5,B00IBKXSB4,"A MUST VIEW for theater fans and would-be actors. A university MUST OWN. See the business of stage production up close and personal with some of the truly great British stars. This DVD documentary spends time with candid cameras rolling through the entire process of a production at London's West End district, specifically the nearly 300-year-old Theatre Royal Haymarket, although the current building is a mere c200 years young. The theater is amazingly restored and cared for. Viewers get to personally meet not only the stars, but all involved including carpenters, plumbers, ushers, bar maids, director, well everyone, even the notorious theater's ghost.

This presentation follows the progress of the 2009 stage drama of ""Waiting for Godot"", Samuel Beckett's masterpiece with the 4 characters being Sir Patrick Stewart as Didi, Sir Ian KcKellen as Gogo, Simon Callow as Pozzo, and Ronald Pickup as Lucky. 6 episodes reveal the fun and fears and friendships behind the curtain of ""Godot."" The next production that followed was the first theater production of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". The Capote play starred Anna Friel as Holly Golightly, and the DVD gives glimpses of the work done prior to the first curtain call. Sadly, only small bits of the actual plays are preserved in this educational and entertaining footage.
If you have never had the chance to be backstage or involved in any way with a theater presentation, this DVD will show you what it is like. Warning: watching this may give you the urge to run right out and join a local community theater production.

6256588,5,B00IBKXSB4,"Needless to say, having Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart in this thing guarantees success, but it's even better than one might imagine.  The living theater has so many moving parts, and it's fun to get a peek around.",1330992000,4,216,4.684210526315789
8640691,5,B00IBKXSB4,This is a great video which shows all aspects of putting on a show. Highly recommend and of course all the actors are tops in their field.,1509753600,,138,4.148148148148148
8640692,3,B00IBKXSB4,"Honestly, I thought people giving this a negative review were just upset to find that this wasn't a video of WAITING FOR GODOT. But no, they're right - this is a poorly directed, poorly edited series that proclaims to bring us backstage at a West End theatre and, if you stick to the true letter of the word, they do. But for all the shots of fixing toilets, there's no historical background to the building's history. Multiple interviews with plumbers and an usher that go nowhere and illuminate nothing, and a tease of a first episode making you think we'll see something of the creative process of the theatre when no, this is a crappy thrown-together piece lucky to have some A-list stars caught on film.  Get Kevin Spacey's NOW instead.",1471996800,4,741,4.656488549618321
8640693,5,B00IBKXSB4,"This is as close as I'll get to seeing these two theater geniuses working on Becket, and the show is grand.",1440892800,,107,4.142857142857143
8640694,1,B00IBKXSB4,"I was so hoping to see much more of the production itself--or at least more details on the set, etc. Instead, there are only occasional glimpses of WAITING FOR GODOT with Sir Patrick Steward and Sir Ian McKellen. After constant picture of a pair fixing a bathroom--or of interviews with an usher--I finally fast forwarded most of the rest. The last two episodes weren't even about GODOT, but rather BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S.

I directed plays for 12 years as a teacher and have enjoyed theater all my life. I'm not sure what the goal of this DVD was--but the only really touching moment was when Patrick Stewart commented on his friendship with McKellen. The quality of the filming was very poor, and jumped around too quickly.

Very disappointed.",1426809600,4,745,4.8125
8640695,2,B00IBKXSB4,"This British documentary series about the Haymarket Theatre will be of interest only to the most devoted fans of British Theatre.  Though Ian McKellin and Patrick Stewart loom large in the publicity for the DVD, the viewer gets only snapshot-like moments with these two eminent actors.  Much of the series focuses on the maintenance problems of the historic theatre, the staff who keep the building up and running, and the installation of a complex set for one of the two productions taking place during the filming of the series.",1420848000,2,530,4.943820224719101

8640698,4,B00IBKXSB4,I am hesitating buying this documentary because I want the complete performance recorded for dvd. In other words I want to watch the play. Is this the only option to de McKellen and Stewart in Godot?,1409270400,,199,4.555555555555555
8640699,5,B00IBKXSB4,"Superb documentary for anyone who likes theater, the craft of acting and/or Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. I saw them in New York in Waiting for Godot and it was fantastic to see the backstage part of the London production. Maybe a bit too much of the plumbing work.",1404604800,,269,4.510204081632653
8640700,3,B00IBKXSB4,"Great documentary for everybody who loves theatre.
On the other hand, we'd like to see a little more of the actors, director and of the irk that actually goes into a production like this, and maybe a little less of the people fixing the toilets.
The documentary divides its time equally between on stage and off stage. If the ""off stage"" segments were about lighting, set, costume designers, then it would be interesting. Unfortunately we're shown people fixing toilets and mending roofs... absolutely politically correct, but very, VERY dull.
So, the three stars instead of five, is because of this. The rest is great and Stewart and McKellen are both quite sweet and very good.",1403222400,5,679,4.913043478260869
