8651850,5,B001LXIDSQ,"I bought several of the different HIT Favorites DVDs.  Out of all of them, this is the kid's favorite.  They love this particular FiFi and the Flowertots and the Barney tale the most. My two and three year olds and I watch together and they always ask to play it again and again.  It is hard to find the FiFi DVDs in the US Region.",1397174400,,331,4.061538461538461
8651851,4,B001LXIDSQ,"On this DVD you get Barney, Thomas!, Bob the Builder, Fifi, Fireman Sam and Kipper.  The episodes are:

o  Barney - Barney's Big Garden
o  Thomas and Friends - Thomas Sets Sail (have to admit I thought I had seen ALL the Thomas', but I don't recall seeing this one before)
o  Bob the Builder - Roley's Flat Garden
o  Fifi and the Flower Pots - Flowertot Rainbow
o  Fireman Sam - Fit for Nothing
o  Kipper - The Butterfly

I sort of like these Hit Entertainment DVDs where they offer a variety of shows to choose from.  I think it sort of reduces the boredom factor.  Plus, if you have a child that doesn't like ""Fifi and the Flower Pots"" for some reason, you can cajole them into waiting a few minutes with the idea that something they will like will be on next.

I give this DVD **4 Stars** for it's usefulness on rainy days.  And because it offers adults a chance to preview shows they might not have seen before.  It didn't get 5 Stars because there are no additional features, which is pretty much de rigueur these days.
