The series tells the story of Mildred Hubble attending Cackle's Academy for witches, and given her clumsy nature and talent for getting into trouble, she is quickly known at the school as ""the worst witch."" Although she is the worst witch in the school, Mildred also has a talent for quick thinking and bravery, always saving the school from evil witches or whatever else may threaten the school and it's inhabitants. The cast in this series are first rate from the staff to the students. Notable performances are given from Kate Duchene as Deputy Head Miss Hardbroom, Una Stubbs as Miss Bat (she's hilarious!) and Clare Coulter as the Head of the School Miss Cackle. The series is delightful, though hard to find on DVD for a decent price, with some searching it can be done. I highly recommend picking up any of the volumes on DVD for a fun escape to the world of Cackles Academy!",1338163200,,1005,4.620111731843576
