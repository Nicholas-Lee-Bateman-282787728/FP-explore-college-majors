532605,3,6303022936,"Honestly, I can't stress enough that this movie, while not particularly good on the surface, is much smarter than it appears.  The entire cast acts under the hazy impression that rising zombies aren't that out of the  ordinary.  Seeing a high-schooler chastise his undead friend for eating  another student with the line ""Colleges look at this sort of  thing!"" is indicative of the type of humor at work here.  Take it for  what it's worth.  No, this isn't Oscar material, but 20 years from now,  this will be a cult classic.  I laughed all the way through at the concept  of a zombie's (living) parents gleefully assisting in his cannabalism.  But  hey, that's just me.",923702400,21,670,4.721739130434782

532738,4,6303022936,"In 1993 it grossed a not so much $3.3 million in the domestic box office.  A film with such a solidly American appeal was never released overseas but it probably should have seen farther shores.  When we think of the horrible Zombie flicks the Europeans have sent us it would serve them right to have a sweet American teen film about Zombie love sent to them.  They might even like it.  I did.
 Lets start with the stuff that we like.  First of all, the film makers had the backing of a major studio.  This is a full on studio production with all that means in terms of the production values, the sound, lighting and what not, that come across poorly in low budget Zombie flicks.  No problems there.  Director Bob Balaban has accumulated more than 25 directorial gigs but we recognize him as a frequent character actor with some 102 gigs. You would recognize him at once.  So the direction is solid.  Ditto the writing.  This makes writer Dean Loreys first time at bat and he presents a credible if not exactly original script.  He borrows from hither and yon including from Heaven Can Wait.  These guys depend upon frequent dream sequences for much of the action which seems to zig and jink the flow of the story to my view.  Minor quibble this.  Lorey went on to have a strong career as a writer and producer in Hollywood.  He and Balaban-along with many cast members-are still active in show biz.
 Side note-writer Lorey came to earth two years after director Bob Balabans first acting role.  Balaban has been working in Tinsel Town for 50 years.
 The cast must make up one of if not the most impressive cast of any Zombie movie ever filmed.  Four future Oscar winners went on film for this light hearted teem romance with a Zombie as the leading man.  Director Bob Balaban has an Oscar nomination, so he must be pretty good too.
 A nice but unpopular kid (Andrew Lowery) has had a crush on Missy (Tracy Lind) since 1st grade.  She is only peripherally aware of his existence.  On the eve of the senior year prom, he stages a fake robbery at the connivance store where she works only to have an real robber come in and shoot him dead.  Well, he stays dead long enough for the funeral, then comes back.  This kid gets Zombied not from comets, serum, gas, or virus but from a clerical error in Heaven.  The boy is an earnest if very ordinary guy, the girl a spectacular knock out.  He did die for her, which makes him special.  He also came back from the dead.  Not many high school girls can claim a suitor with such determination.  I found it all rather sweet.
 But the cast make this thing work.  They take a silly sort of teen romance and play it with dead pan seriousness even when the unlikely Zombie theme enters the mix.  The boys mom and dad are played by Edward Herman, a familiar face with 131 credits and Mary Beth Hurt is hilarious as the helpful, protective mother.  Both are still working.
 Lowery and Lind do fine.  Lind was 25 when she played the younger school girl but both did fine and Lind was just scrumptious.  I did have to stifle my laugh reflex when she over used the ling Eat me with no innuendo offered, simple smut served with the very thin Zombie theme fig leaf.
 Also in the cast are Oscar winners Cloris Leachman as the wife of a previous Zombie mix up, Matthew McConaghey as Guy 2 in his first big screen role and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as a lumpish teen bully.  Oscar winner Rene Zellweger was also filmed for the movie as a girl preparing for the prom in the local beauty shop but she ended up on the cutting room floor.  All these actors, save the late Mr. Hoffman, still have active careers.
 The occasionally helpful local doctor is played by funny man and now very experienced actor Austin Pendleton.  You will recognize him from his 133 roles.  His best line was We usually don't see this much activity in a dead person.
 I recommend My Boyfriends Back for the enjoyment factor and as an example of a studio effort of the era.  It carries a mild PG-13 rating with mild eating mostly hinted at, ditto for teen sexual themes.  More is hinted at then shown, no skin reveled.  There is a running gag about specific body parts rotting away which comes about as close to an outright sexual reference as we get.  It runs one hour and 25 minutes.  Three and a half brains for this star filled teen romance.",1443484800,9,4348,4.406289308176101

533023,5,6303022936,"Growing up I would classify myself as a ""pure"" slasher fan. I didn't enjoy comedy mixed with my horror as I found that more often than not it diluted the effectiveness of the scares. That's not to say that I didn't ever enjoy the comedy-horror subgenre. ""Night of the Creeps"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"" were two of my favorites from the subgenre growing up. Maybe it has something to do with zombies. I never was able to take them very seriously so they seemed to mix well into the comedy format for me. All of this brings me to one of my favorite horror-comedies from the early 90's, the sorely underrated ""My Boyfriend's Back."" Hilarious from beginning to end with some of the driest dark humor to come out of the 90's, the film was a box office bomb on initial release making less than $4 million on a budget of $10 million. With an all star cast (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Matthew McConaughey, Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, and Matthew Fox all appear in small roles) let's dig into this film that deserved to be a hit.

The film starts in a flashback as we meet the young Johnny Dingle at the age of 6, he has been in love with beautiful Missy McCloud for as long as he can possibly remember. For a 6 year old, this is a very, very long time. It is Missy's birthday and he plans to give her a heart shaped locket with the pictures of the two of them enclosed. This is the day where he finally is going to get up the courage to tell her how he feels. What do you know...he chickens out and keeps the locket safely tucked away in his bedroom closet. Someday will be the day, right?

We flash forward ten years to high school where Johnny is still in love with the still beautiful Missy but Missy has a boyfriend: the typical jerk jock boyfriend played with swarmy perfection by Matthew Fox. Johnny finds out through the grapevine that the two have recently broken up so he decides to make his movie in the most drastic way possible. She works at a convenience store and he plans to have his friend Eddie ""rob"" the place while he heroically saves her. She will fall madly in love with him and they will live happily ever after. The plan doesn't go well and Johnny dies right after Missy says she will go to the prom with him. What's a guy to do? Come back from the dead for his girl of course.

This results in some of the most delicious dark comedy I've ever seen in a wide release horror comedy as the town doesn't seem to react much to the fact that Johnny has come back from the dead (well, besides the ones that want to burn him at the stake but...). With a game cast and some off the wall humor, it just puts a smile on my face. I hope it also puts a smile on yours.",1342656000,3,2670,4.221135029354207
533084,4,6303022936,"That one is a banquet of bad taste but of good flesh. It eats at everything and bites at the rest. Cops are not swift in their authority and uniforms. The jocks are not very intelligent since they only have muscle in their skull. The bullies just get what they deserve, an axe in the head. I don't see how they don't get an Indian in the head of some of the local bigots.

But don't think parents are going to be better. They are just infatuated with their dear genial children, sons or daughters, who are the acme of chicken-guano and bull-pie, and these children actually are just that, guano and cow-pie. With whip cream on top and a cherry to crown it off. A la mode and with style.

And the doctor is of course a mad scientist who only thinks of one thing: to make money from the dead flesh of the zombie. Money money money. Yum yum yummy. Cosmetic surgery without the surgery. Doesn't it sound fine and attractive? The dead have to collaborate and bring some added value to the living after all. The State could even have a Value Added Tax on the dead. Perfect indeed.

School teachers and other school personnel are just what they are a school of cold fish that stink high heavens like rotting salmon in a polluted river. And I will not say what happens to the trout in the lake. Dead fish can also be zombies. But then they do not have fish bones in their bodies, rather perambulating decaying radiations, like in nuclear radiations. Don't touch. It burns.

So the poor Dingle who is a dongle in life and a zombie in death will be revived by some miracle worked out by Saint Peter himself after his severe mistake and a fit of anger which should be directed onto himself but is mis-directed onto the poor Johnny. It is not easy to dangle between life and death, between the morgue and the grave, between the insanity of the saints and the sanity of Satan.

The film is funny, though of course not as funny as Michael Jackson's rewriting of the Night of the Living Dead. It is true here we have the Prom of the Living Dead mixing with the dead living. That sounds more romantic than terrifying. But it is horrifyingly gross at times and Shakespearian at other times; They even have the balcony scene of Romeo and Juliet revisited for young zombies with decaying muscles. I just wonder where the three weird sisters are?

Ah! Ah! Ah! Three times of course.

533085,5,6303022936,"This movie was absolutely hallarious! I was about 10 or 11 when I saw this movie for the first time, so it wasn't exactly the way I remember it. But you all know how it is when you see a movie when you are little and remember it being really scary or completely different when you watch it when your older. For some reason I thought that this movie was about a boy who started dating a girl and they fell in love. Some way or another he ended up dying and coming back to life, and his body parts started falling off, lol. And they just wanted to wait until they could go the dance together before he went and crossed over. Well that is not at all how it happend, lol. It is about a boy who has this huge crush on a girl and thought that by being really brave and protecting her from a robber that she would accept his invitation to go to the dance with him. Well in an altercation to him protecting her from the robber he gets shot and dies. Then he comes back to life and for some reason she can't resist him and absoulutely has to go to the dance with him. Well his body parts do start to fall off and for him to last long enough to go to the dance he has to eat living flesh. So, it happened a little differently than I remember, but it was still a great movie and had my sister and I laughing up a storm.

533157,4,6303022936,"This TV film revolves around the somewhat unwilling reunion of a female musical group that was a teen sensation. It's most famous hit song was ""My Boyfriend's Back""--the title of the film. The film stars Jill Eikenberry of LA Law fame, Sandy Duncan of TV's Hogan Family, and Judith Light--who skyrocketed to fame as closeted prostitute & doctor's wife, Karen Wolek, on the ABC Daytime Drama One Life To Live in the late 70s-mid 80s, and then, found primetime sitcom icon status with ABC's Who's The Boss? and now Ugly Betty. I originally watched this film debut on TV and had enjoyed it very much. When I saw it again on Amazon, I was hit by a wave of nostalgia. It was even better in some respects than I  remembered. I have to say that the major draw for me at the time & still is Judith Light. I have been a fan since her phenomenal days on OLTL and then on WTB. I am so thrilled she is back on primetime again with Ugly Betty.

The film touches on some great dramatic issues and all three ladies have great comedic timing. And, it's a chance to hear all three sing, which is worth the time.",1207353600,5,1094,4.305825242718447

After many ups and downs...the three ladies are able to come to terms with their issues and become friends again.

He comes back as a zombie and begins to live life as if nothing ever happened. Of course, there are certain body parts that fall off and stuff, but that's to be expected from a rotting corpse. There are a few jokes and gags in here that are genuinely funny, in a sophmoric way. The best come from chacrter actor Austin Pendleton as a nutty doctor.
