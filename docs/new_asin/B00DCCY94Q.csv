5788946,5,B00DCCY94Q,"Watched this great film several days ago, and i have to say that i really liked it. It takes place deep down below the streets i believe it is somewhere in germany or berlin. There are several really cute girls and guys who hire a tour guide to show them the deep dark tunnels deep below a dance club. The storyline was alright, and the filming was okay... but i found the lighting to be so dark that you couldn't see much of anything. most of the film shows these unlucky adults getting picked off one by one, by a really warped, insane, disturbed man who lives in what looks like to be a abandoned bomb shelter. As the girls and guys are picked off they are drug to a freezer department where they are prepared for the madman;s next meal. when the tour guide falls and breaks his leg two of the girls go to seek help. (it is never fully explained... but i think that there is a sexual relation between the two girls). What is a little confusing... the girls just disappear and it is never explained as to what happens to them. Later in the film there is a unclothed body and head that may have been the remains of the two... (i wonder if maybe 10 minutes of their demise that hit the cutting room floor). Was hoping that the ending would have been a little better... with some of the girls escaping... but it didn't end that way. I get the impression that the killer will come back to life for another later film. Overall this film may be liked by more guys than gals... there was alot of blood and gore in it that was very creepy.",1382400000,3,1533,4.217687074829932
5788947,4,B00DCCY94Q,"Originally titled ""Urban Explorers"" The Depraved was slow getting to the meat but the characters and actors who played them were good enough to keep me interested until the good stuff happened.
A German guide and four young explorers decide to tour the tunnels and bunkers hidden underneath Berlin and all is well until the guide Kris played by Max Riemelt falls down a deep hole and massacres his leg, bone sticking out and in dire need of help.

Help comes in the form of a big man that looks like something you would see in a nightmare but they accept his help because what other choice do they have?He promises to help them by bringing them to his place so they can call for help. This is where the good part begins.his place is really somewhat of a Torture chamber and little do they know he is a cannibal and all he see's when he looks at them is food.there are some very tense, gory and frighting scenes, then ensues the fight for survival thousands of feet underground in a foreign country and no one can her them scream.

who will survive? you will have to watch and see.the gore is well done,not over the top but a nice amount is given to us slasher lovers. The last 40 minutes or so are action packed and well worth the wait.",1374624000,3,1236,4.346320346320346
5788948,2,B00DCCY94Q,"Originally released under the title ""Urban Explorers.""

Four foreigners hire a tour guide (Max Riemelt) to explore the tunnels and bunkers under the city of Berlin. Things don't go as planned as one might surmise from the cover and the title.

The underground aspect of the film was interesting. The capture, fight, and torture doesn't start until late in the film. While it was gory, the plot was light, formulaic, and the bad guy was incomplete. The meaning between the various tales and the bunker with our torturer didn't connect too well.

5788949,2,B00DCCY94Q,"Terminally horrifying content, with probably no redeeming social or artistic value. Are the producers of these pictures trying to develop endemic PTSD, among a wide swath of the movie-going public? I'm not sure someone should have not indicted and shot (perhaps eviscerated) the movie-makers on this one. (As a strong proponent of Free Speechand artistic expression--I mean this metaphorically, of course, but much of this content I find very alarming, even appalling). Now the present film was probably not as bad as the one with students on a train traveling across Eastern Europe, with a sociopath pursuing the passengers (and even dissecting a living human being, on one car). Maybe ""The Hostel""  (or ""Hostel: Part II"")? Nope, it was ""The Train.""  Fatally sick stuff....with intense suspense, violence and gore (and a thin plot)...do not a superior film make. I find some of these films immensely disturbing, and I DO include ""Saw"" and Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" There is a kind of ""psychological enormity"" surrounding and infusing this dramatically Dark and shocking genre.

Let me end this by sharing with you that I find myself chuckling about my teenage years, when the Roman Catholic Churchs Legion of Decency, issued ridiculous proclamations about the dangers of pictures like The Carpetbagers (and comics like Lenny Bruce). Yet, the slasher type of films today are exponentially more horrifying than ANYTHING available in the mid twentieth centuryeven as the DefJam style of comedy, in recent years, is embarrassingly crude and profane.",1434153600,,1548,5.310204081632653
5788950,3,B00DCCY94Q,"Despite its weak structure, with a slow beginning and a shrug of an ending, a cast with mixed acting levels and the fact that it's not sure whether it's a movie mostly about urban legends or a straight slasher film, it's still more than averagely entertaining...I'd give it 6 out of 10 stars. The tunnels under Berlin are a great setting for a horror film and I kind of wish the sequel to As Above So Below might be filmed there. Speaking of AASB, if you liked that movie already, this one is along the same lines, but is more likely to disappoint.",1430006400,,548,4.330097087378641
5788951,3,B00DCCY94Q,"There is everything a horror buff would seek- blood, entrails, carnage, cruelty, evil, violence- but the one thing it lacks is a storyline. I like my horrors bloody with a side of substance, someg to hold on to and take away, this film fails to present anything more than visual and audio stimulation that only lasts as long as the scenes. It wasn't a complete let down, but lacking a developed plot is a deal breaker for me. I expect horror with intelligence, I'm not simply in it for the splatter.",1421193600,,499,4.4945054945054945

5788953,1,B00DCCY94Q,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

I just don't get it. This movie had a great start. Terrific setting, great atmosphere, good directing and cinematography, good acting...introduces really creepy sadistic killer...then becomes yet another mind-boggling presentation of abject stupidity. Would you sit outside a door for several excruciating minutes as your lover was being repeatedly suffocated and brutally tortured, while the whole time the killer is distracted and you have a deadly weapon? Would you then try to trap the sadist by making noise, luring and  locking him in a room, then leaving only a FORK in a lock to hold him at bay when you could have killed him a second time? Then fired warning shots instead of killing him? Then not bashed his head in despite the pleas of the girlfriend when he is helpless? Then repeatedly separated from her, then left her and tried out cell phones (with no idea where you are miles underground) oblivious to the killer hunting you...etc. etc. etc. She escapes, then stops running for no reason at a train station. Then unwashed, grimy, supposedly bullet-ridden and bloody killer is believed by rational locals to be a ticket collector despite her being obviously traumatized and terrified, and making repeated pleas that he will kill her...really? WTF? BTW-these are supposed to be ""urban explorers"" here; experienced, survival-focused, daring adventurers. The script writer created characters who are so stupid you wonder how they can eat breakfast cereal without killing themselves.

You have the budget, the setting, the actors...why not a good movie? So easy to make minor changes to make believable. This movie is a travesty. If you like movies which have initial potential but which become mind-explodingly stupid (I'm looking at you, ATM and Crowsnest), or like to watch mentally challenged people get tortured, then have at it.

5788955,4,B00DCCY94Q,"I'm giving it the four stars because of the good acting, but there are other movies about horrors beneath a city. I saw little wisdom in any of the character development, especially when they experienced incidents that should have told them to get out of there. The bad guy is really repulsive and believable. There is a lot of violence, but what the heck? That's the norm of horror movies. There were scary scenes, so I recommend it.",1398384000,,434,4.576923076923077

5788957,4,B00DCCY94Q,"This film doesn't try to be pretty. Not your standard 'entertainment' fare but a serious horror offering. Its not over the top, though. A couple of kills are pretty brutal but its not one of 'those' movies. The movie was reminiscent of another film  (Creep- an excellent movie) but its not another Creep. There are more differences than similarities. Its just a feeling I had while watching it. You know how I feel about those reductive comparisons by now... The premise was creative: a nazi experiment created people highly resistant to pain and hard to kill that are rumored to live in the tunnels our 'urban explorers' are exploring. We do not see a community but 1 man and he is enough. The film was well done, though I was a little frustrated that there weren't any subtitles for the portions of dialogue in German. Still, it wasn't that much and it doesn't actually prevent you from knowing what you need to know, The rest is a struggle for survival. Its a dark, claustrophobic, and gritty film.  :)",1392595200,4,1005,4.640449438202247
5788958,3,B00DCCY94Q,"A stereotypic, done many times before, plot of young adults continuously making dumb decisions in an underground environment while being chased by bad person (s). Cheap to make - just need abandoned or little used dark corridors/rooms with a few cheap to hire ($100/day) actors and a few prosthetics with the usual associated torture props. This one added a tiresome and almost pointless Nazi backstory. Slight variations between all these nearly identical films coupled with a not discerning audience results in enough profit to keep this sub genre in business. Three stars because this film accomplished it all a bit better than most in it's field. No special features and no subtitling for hard of hearing and for a dialect of english, although quite good, was still difficult to follow at times.",1392422400,3,799,5.0606060606060606

8591682,3,B00DCCY94Q,"The Depraved begins by showing two female friends sitting at a restaurant table.  When taking a picture of herself on her phone intended for her boyfriend the one woman says her boyfriend commits to the side.  Her Asian friend says ""Suicide?""  She replies ""Yeah, that one!""  A man and her boyfriend wait outside for a man to show up.  When he does, well, he's a tour guide named Chris.  Chris says what they're about to do isn't legal.  They all head into a nearby club and party.  In the basement the two girls at the restaurant and this boyfriend named Dennis and his girlfriend head to the basement of the club to await Chris.  He mentions a 2-hour walk underground and mentions a bunker with Nazi drawings.  He opens the door and says ""Welcome to the dark side of Berlin!"" They encounter bats, a Nazi shooting gallery, the border between east and west Berlin and the place where slave workers used to stay.

An angry man with a dog appears. He throws Chris down because a woman in the group took a picture of the guy and he's camera shy.  The Asian woman smacks the man's dog with a stick which upsets him more.  He throws her into a wall.  The men then walk away.  The tour guide thinks they were criminals.  The group continues the tour through a sewer as the two friends tickle each other.  A sewer isn't an ideal tickling spot.  They climb to a classroom with desks and chairs and have coffee.

Dennis asks how a piano got here.  Chris the tour guide says a commercial.  Chris also mentions a Nazi space ship.  The Nazi's were obsessed with conquering space along with the world.  The space ship had the best crew and the power of the coming race.  They were subjects to terrible experiments like strengthening life spans, building tolerance to pain and combining their genes with human strengths.  Many died, and those who didn't die turned on the doctors.  Some say they're still down here roaming the tunnels.  The piano was used to cast spells over people and transform them with German classical romantic music which would turn the people into slaves.  The tour guide says there's many blank spots in the tunnels of Berlin.

A woman panics when a cockroach climbs out of her spilled coffee.  The groups finds themselves having to walk closely on a high beam in order to get across.  One slip and it looks like they'd face hundreds of feet down.  When one woman almost slips the tour guide says ""Hey, you wanted to go to special places didn't you!""  They crawl to deeper locations and see very well done drawings on the wall.  Chris the tour guide says these are symbols of Germans protecting family, friendship, industry and agriculture.  The Asian woman and her friend almost kiss during a moment of quiet time.  When the woman snaps a picture of Chris it catches shim by surprise and he falls somewhere below.

Oh, I guess it wasn't hundreds of feet below that high balancing act like it looked like.  Dennis climbs down and finds the guy laying on the floor with broken bones.  His girlfriend is a nurse so she has to climb down and check on him.  Dennis needs the Asian girl and her friend to get help.  The girlfriend determines Chris has internal bleeding and is in bad shape.  The Asian woman and her friend get lost trying to find a way out.  While waiting the girlfriend thinks the creeps got the Asian girl and her friend.

Dennis and his girlfriend see a flashlight above and then an old man appears.  He can't speak English.  Some of his words are English so I think he's lying.  Dennis interprets what he says.  He said he's going for help so the group can send Chris to the hospital, and that Chris won't make it if he has to stay here.  They climb out of this area and with the help of the old man, carry Chris out of here.  They carry him to a room where tomato soup is boiling on the stove.

The old man injects Chris with a shot.  The girlfriend asks why he has all this hospital stuff.  The old man explains his story in German.  He pretends he fires a machine gun and pulls out a knife.  I can't believe the boyfriend isn't translating this information to his girlfriend in English so we can understand it.  The girlfriend asks how many people he shot at the border and the old man gets upset, so apparently he can understand English.  Just can't speak it.

Dennis tries to continue the conversation with the old man in another room but the old man quickly turns around and injects something in his throat.  Dennis wakes up in a room chained to a bed and handcuffed.  He's able to unscrew and untie himself.  Just then the old man appears and walks in his room.  Dennis leaves the room with a bat in his hand and walks around slowly.  He picks up the phone but the line's cut.  He hears screaming in the other room and a ""Help me!"" from his girlfriend.

Dennis finds his girlfriend chained to a chair and being tortured by the old man.  The man wraps a bag around her head then lets go.  He's just teasing his victim I guess.  He places the bag over her head some more!  The old man takes out a blow torch and lights her hair on fire.  Frustrated and scared, Dennis knocks over a metal cabinet outside to get the old man's attention.  He hides in a dark room and waits for the old man.  When he arrives he stabs the man in the eye and runs to his girlfriend.

The old man flings the door open ready to stab someone.  He comes up to the girlfriend and cuts the side of her head while the boyfriend cowers again.  Dennis then pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot the old man.  The old man gets the upperhand and punches Dennis while he shoots all over the place.  Just then Dennis shoots the old man!  He then smacks the old man repeatedly with a metal stick because a gunshot to the chest isn't enough!

The boyfriend and girlfriend run away.  Dennis sneaks back and grabs the key from the dead old man... and apparently he isn't dead based on the way Dennis is so hesitant.  Just then the old man jumps up and shoots at the two.  Dennis foot breaks as he falls down the stairs.  Now is NOT the time to have a broken foot!  In preseason football maybe, but not here.  Just then the floor  opens and the girlfriend hangs onto Dennis's hand.  What the!  Dennis releases his grip and she only slides 2 feet down, lol.  He tells her to stay put while he deals with the crazy old man who should be dead but isn't.  Yes, leave the girlfriend in a hole so the old man can climb down and kill her.  Makes sense!  Dennis tries to reach for her but she's a few feet too low for this to happen.  He tells her to stay put while he goes back for a rope.

Dennis finds the Asian girls head in a refrigerator and determines the tomato soup she had earlier with his girlfriend had her body juices in it.  This part is lame!  Would've been better if the Asian girl and her friend had been written out of the script.  Dennis tries to call for help but the old man grabs the phone, talks to the person on the other end then smacks Dennis around before shooting him in the foot.  He takes Dennis shirt off since it's easier to stab his stomach that way.  The good news for the old man is that he cuts Dennis near the kitchen sink so his blood drips in the sink.  The old man picks up a handful of salt and tosses it at the stomach wound making Dennis scream.  The old man mentions Mickey Mouse as we cut back to the girlfriend hiding in the hole.  She crawls through the mud and leaves the whole underground area.  Meanwhile Dennis is trapped somewhere with rats crawling over his wounds.  His hands are tied together so he's not having a good time at all.

The girlfriend collapses near a subway train and begs a man for help.  She asks the man to make a phone call and call for help but he can't press the button in time.  A man sneaks up behind him and gushes open his neck with a rope.  Yup it's the old man again.  He somehow got to the surface just as easily as the girlfriend.  He probably climbed through the same hole she did.  The girlfriend gets on a subway train and somehow knows the old man is out there despite the fact she shouldn't have these worries.  She should assume Dennis is trying to track the old man down in the underground area.  On the subway train the old man sits is one of the seats and pretends he's a normal passenger.

The old man says this girl is the fashion type.  A man who speaks English interprets what the old man is saying.  He says the girl has to be taken off the train because she doesn't have a ticket.  The old man is clearly pretending he's a cop.  The man immediately thinks the old man is honest despite the girl screaming for help.  Weird!  The old man grabs the girl after they walk off the train.  He tries to shoot her in the back of the head but he doesn't have any bullets.  so he simply snaps her neck.  I guess that religious necklace the girlfriend was holding didn't work.  He drags her away while the boyfriend crawls out of the hole he was in.  The old man throws her body with the other dead bodies and then returns to the subway to clean up the blood.  He does a good job moping the floor but makes the phone button bloodier with his cloth.  The boyfriend tries to climb out of the hole but drowns.  The old man brushes his teeth.  Dennis might be alive actually.  I think we hear him breathing when daylight comes out.

Given the story with the Nazi's that Chris mentions earlier i expected a bigger more elaborate storyline so I'm surprised it's simply about an old man who goes around killing a boyfriend and girlfriend.  With that said, this is some pretty good suspense.  It's not a particularly great story though, and there's holes everywhere.  The characters aren't anything great either.
