7833841,4,630296993X,"The setting is pre-history. The villain of the story, an egotistical and homicidal brat named Vood, driven from his tribe for murdering their chief / his own father, accidentaly stumbles upon, in the aftermath of a ferocious volcanic eruption, the secret of iron.  He then returns to his tribe with this discovery and rouses them into a ruthless hord armed with swords fashioned from molten iron and bent on empirical expansionism, subjugation ( of neighboring tribes ), and even genocide ( slaughtering a race of sub-human ape-like creatures called ursu ).  Their reign of terror is ultimately quelled when one plagued and tyranized tribe invents bows and arrows, thereby uping the ante on them ( so to speak ) and kicking their asses .
Overall, I like this flick alot and do consider it to be pretty good.  Sure, it does have the superficial elements which would characterize it as ""shlock"" or ""grade B"" and which cant escape criticism.  Specificaly some ludicrus dubbed voices, some corny comic-book like dialogue, typicaly campy cave-era costumes ( men clad in loincloths and bone & claw necklaces, fur bikinis for the womenfolk, .. very reminiscent of One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch in other words. Not that I'm complaining ), and some actors who don't look too pre-historic ( the hero and heroin looking particularly out of place among the otherwise earthy looking cast.  Respectively resembling a hair-metal rocker and an 80's glamour-girl with perms and mascara ).  The makers of this flick surely weren't going for arrant realism like they did with say Quest For Fire.  However this flick does also have it's good qualities which, in my view, do triumph over it's flawes and render it an engaging and enjoyable viewing experience. It has a good story and concept ( a sort of prehistoric parable on the arms race )with some good developments( particularly the villains transition from mere punk fugitive to truely sinister and menacing meglamaniacle despot adorned in a frightening helmet fashioned from the head of a slain lion,.. or ""Ra"" as it's called in the film ), a good musical score( featuring very efective and memorable use of a sitar ), some very good actual locations( which stand very convincingly for prehistoric ), a sincere message, some likeable characters, and is even rather touching at times.
There is even some occasional bits of inspired and thoughtful dialogue, such as when one character, an elderly peace loving sage, sayes ""There are times when man developes the instincts of the wild beast !  There is an evil side to all of us !  We must combat this violence with wisdome and with persuasion from the heart !"" or when the vanquished head villain ominously intones ""You have defeated me, .. but in time there will be another Vood !!"" ( think Ghangis Kahn, Atilla the Hun, Adolf Hitler, Osama Bin Laden, .. does ring true ).
Something that always struck me about this film is that it was rather untimely. It seemed to have come a bit too late ( by about a whole decade ) for it's own good.  It's anti-war theme would've been perfectly resonant during the late 60's / early 70's hippie era, and I think that it might've been a more sucsesful and popular film , posibly even a potential cult-classic, had it come out during THAT era instead of the more cynical minded 80's ( in which that theme seemed outmoded and irrelevant ).

 If taken as a kinde of cinematic comic book, with a certain degree of thematic substance and inteligence, rather than a serious history lesson, then Ironmaster can be a quite enjoyable viewing experience.",1300233600,,3577,4.826797385620915

When we recieved it we were so suprised it was in English and were totally pleased. Thanks to this seller this VHS was in perfect shape and more than we expected!",1297814400,,302,4.315789473684211
7833843,1,630296993X,"I bought this movie because part of it was filmed in South Dakota. That part was interesting to me, but overall the movie is pretty bad. If you like this style of film, stick with Conan the Barbarian.",1233619200,2,200,4.2894736842105265
7833844,5,630296993X,"This movie will not appeal to most viewers. However, I don't hold ""most viewers'"" opinions in very high esteem, and this movie is a good example of why. It was shot on an obviously tiny budget (check out those 'elephants'!) and has quite a thick layer of cheeze; in fact I originally picked up the VHS for $0.99 at Blockbuster thinking it looked like something that would fit perfectly on MST3K, and undoubtedly it would. I wasn't, however, prepared for such a fun and engaging movie! Almost everything about the movie, from the dialogue to the ""special"" effects to the costumes (one notable exception being the gorgeous locations, it was filmed in Custer National Park in South Dakota) is laughable, but is, like Lenzi's direction, none the less endearing. If you're seeking an antidote to the high-budget, star-studded, multi-million dollar pieces of crap that are floating around the toilet bowl of modern main-stream cinema then I recommend picking up Ironmaster. It's a beautiful, entertaining and engaging work in spite of all its many 'flaws'.",1160697600,6,1050,5.040229885057471
7833845,2,630296993X,"Ever wonder how man discovered iron? Well it's pretty certain it wasn't this way.
In this dreadful Italian-made ""epic,"" an evil caveman is exiled from his tribe, but discovers iron in the aftermath of a volcano.  With the help of a strange mystical woman, he learns to fashion it into a  weapon, with which he raises an army and attacks the tribe. The hero winds  up in a village of more advanced prehistoric people who presumably  represent goodness and culture. Events of course lead to a climactic  showdown and a moral lesson.  There are no real surprises in this except  how remarkably lame the script is and how bad the acting is. The fighting  scenes are occasionally interesting, but it's really hard to imagine  watching this whole movie for such a small payoff. Searchers for that  great, groundbreakingly good caveman movie need not stop here. People who  love chuckling at ""spaghetti epics"" will find some  satisfaction.
I have seen three other movies, ""2001, a Space  Oddysy,""  ""Quest For Fire,"" and ""Caveman"" (and I'm  sure there are others) which have mined similar territory (prehistoric  humans or pre-humans make a technological breakthrough). Two of them,  though pretensious, were done seriously and the third was a total comedy.  They were all done well enough to be taken on their own merits. This movie  does not have the quality to be taken seriously, yet does not have the  humor to be taken as camp.",960768000,,1425,4.858333333333333
