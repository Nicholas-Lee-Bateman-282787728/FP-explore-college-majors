3116170,4,B0013LPRR6,"When I was a child growing up in New York City, one of the programs I just loved was The Goldbergs.  I suppose it reminded me, to some extent, of my own family; the closeness, the trial and tribulations, the joy in sharing happy moments and yes, even the smell of mom's cooking.  Gertrude Berg was an innovative lady for her time and she brought the warmth of the family unit to the screen.  This series, although not the original programming set in New York City, takes the Goldbergs to the suburbs of New York.  Once again, we get a glimpse of family life and with it the feeling of nostalgia and a time gone by.  Even if you're not a New Yorker, anyone can relate to this series and walk away with a good feeling.",1242259200,5,716,4.235294117647059
3116171,5,B0013LPRR6,I have just finished watching this complete set and wish that there was more.  I do hope that additional episodes are made available in the near future.  I do have a copy of the full length movie - Molly - and cherish it and guard it.  It came on the American Movie Classic station 10 years ago and luckily I made a copy for myself.  I watch it from time to time when I yearn for a little bit of Molly's nurturing. It would be wonderful if the earlier episodes in The Bronx were available. I have never seen them and they must be gems.,1241308800,5,535,4.066666666666666
3116172,5,B0013LPRR6,"I wasn't familiar with this series before renting it, but was intrigued by the idea of an American TV show from the 40s and 50s about a Jewish-American family from New York that moves to a white suburban neighborhood.

It turned out to be a quiet, sweet, smart comedy that also happens to have been created and written by Gertrude Berg, who stars as Molly Goldberg and who was an innovative and successful trailblazer in radio and television even before Lucy came on the scene.  There's no slapstick here, a la I Love Lucy, but rather quiet day-to-day comedy about Molly's life with her husband, two children, and Uncle David, as well as their friendly but eccentric neighbors.  Molly charms her new neighbors with her cooking and advice, serves on a jury, and becomes convinced through psychology that she secretly hates her family.

Without a laugh track, and with the old-fashioned feel of the series, it's easy to miss some of the very smart and modern humor.  In particular, I loved the humorous mistakes Molly makes in speaking English.  There is no sense of ""making fun"" here, but rather (at least in my opinion) a surprising awareness of and empathy with the immigrant experience.  That said, the jokes are sometimes hilarious, as when Molly, who has left coldcuts on the table for her husband's lunch, tells him she's ""laid you out cold on the table"", or when she instructs her daughter to hang a new dress by telling her to ""go hang yourself in the closet"".

No doubt, the show isn't for everyone, with its quiet domestic concerns that might seem slow-paced to some and its wordplay that requires careful attention.  But I was surprised and pleased to find such a smart and well-written series that I'd never so much as heard of before.",1229299200,13,1746,4.717105263157895
3116173,2,B0013LPRR6,"The radio series, which I used to follow, was far superior to this uninspired television series.  The humor and the intelligence just aren't present.  Sadly, even the low cost of the DVD is not worth it.",1223769600,,203,4.611111111111111

3116175,3,B0013LPRR6,"The stories are solid, the picture quality as you would expect it to be but good stories make up for it.  I was disappointed that Molly and family are in the suburbs, not hanging out the window of the old neighborhood, so to me some of the flavor isn't there, but that was my disappointment and doesn't take away from the ups and downs of the Goldbergs.",1217462400,7,353,4.268656716417911

3116178,3,B0013LPRR6,"I ordered this DVD with great anticipation of renewing old and fond memories of a TV series of my childhood. The series primarily took place in a part of NYC not far where I grew up and I related to many of the characters in both my family and personal life. Sadly, both discs present episodes from what must be nearly the end of the run where the family was trying to assimilate and moved to the suburbs - kind of ""The Jeffersons"" in reverse. Most of the charm was gone, though it was nice to see the actors again. I wish the description of the contents would have made clear what was being presented. However, for the price, not much $$$ was wasted.",1209340800,62,651,4.258064516129032

3116185,5,B0013LPRR6,"Before listening to an NPR expos about Gertrude BERG, I had neither heard nor seen the radio/TV show, ""The Goldbergs"".  It was the radio clips that I listened to that caught my attention...the realness of her voice and the way she delivered the lines.  It was as if she wasn't even acting.  By the end of listening to the expos on the radio, I made a quick dash to my laptop to look her up online, and read more about her and the show.  Once I finished there, I went onto You Tube, and found a video.  I was, in a word, HOOKED!  My next stop was Amazon.com to find whatever video I could.  This was the only one available, and for the price, I couldn't pass it up.

It was like eating a potato chip, I just couldn't stop at one.  I watched all 10 episodes..beginning to end!!  The little nuances from each character made me want to get to know them personally; so the only logically thing to do, was to keep watching.  There is so much good wholesome comedy in this little series of episodes, I quickly became a fan!  From ""Molly's"" endearing mix-ups of common idiomatic expressions, to the loving tone of her voice, I wished I had a family member or a friend like her.

It's amazing the insight you get into the Jewish culture just by watching ""The Goldbergs"".  It doesn't delve into the faith, not by any means, but there's a quiet spiritual undertone that binds this family together.  The accents of ""Molly, Jake, and Uncle David are also endearing, it makes you want to listen to them for hours.

I highly recommend watching this series of episodes, if only to bring a smile to your face!!  Enjoy!!!",1254096000,2,1603,4.379661016949153
3116186,4,B0013LPRR6,"The Molly Goldberg and family that you see in these segments are a good taste of what the lost episodes must have been like.  As the series progressed, she did hang out and ""Yohoo!"" for her house-next-door neighbor, but it was not the same as Mrs. Bloom. I do appreciate that we have at least this, and there is still the charm of the Goldberg family and her wonderful take on the English language. These are also a good slice of the American pie as it was in the 'burbs that grew up after WWII. Molly is always charming, kind, gentle, creative and wise in an understated way. One of the strange things you realize after awhile is that there is no audience participation, no laugh track: a very eerie experience that also makes it more intimate and genuine. For all of this, the price is still right.",1253836800,4,800,4.405405405405405

It was with mild trepidation that I ordered these episodes of The Goldbergs.  I cannot attest to whether these episodes are as good as those that took place in the original setting of the Bronx, but I can say that the first episode alone, though utterly predictable, is thoroughly charming.
