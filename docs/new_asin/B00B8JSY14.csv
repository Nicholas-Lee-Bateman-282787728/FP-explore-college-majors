Bird On A Wire documents Leonard Cohens 1972 tour of Europe and Israel, giving viewers an intimate look at all of the madness, both on and off-stage, that most touring artists with a good-sized following experience on the road. Youll see Cohens world as a constant stream of managers, interviewers, groupies, backstage hangers-on, concert promoters and other assorted creatures. If anything, Bird On A Wire is a precursor to Radioheads Meeting People Is Easy, which also shows the frustrations and absurdities of life on the road as a touring artist. Cohens interpersonal dealings are mildly interesting to watch, but the real draw for me is the concert footage, with no less than fifteen Cohen classics getting an airing before a live audience. As a visual performer Cohens no Iggy Pop, but theres something captivating about watching him wrestle with the solemn beauty of his best songs in front of a live audience. The film is a mixed bag, but definitely worth checking out for Cohen-lovers.",1452297600,,1063,5.252941176470588
