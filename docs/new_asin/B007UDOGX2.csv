8521944,5,B007UDOGX2,Absolutely wonderful and relaxing. I am thrilled with the content and already feel the benenfit after doing the yoga for a couple of days.,1504828800,,138,4.791666666666667
8521945,4,B007UDOGX2,"This is worth the purchase in my opinion, but it's not super high quality, but it does give a really relaxing vibe when you need it... there is no music, just Dr. Lam speaking and guiding you through. As usual, like on his website, he gives an indepth explanation as to how this can help your adrenals and overall stress response... then he begins the guided breathing. I found it difficult to follow at first as I'm so used to breathing short and shallow, but once I've started getting the pattern down, it's extremely relaxing. I've been diagnosed as HyperPOTS (syndrome where to the best of my understanding, my Fight or Flight is in essence stuck ""on"" from AutoImmune, or Viral damage or environmental factors???) either way, it's too early to say much other than I enjoyed it and it seems to help me ""chill out and relax"" a bit easier. I'll try to post an update once I've been practicing a bit more... I also bought the Yoga and am about to try that next.",1494460800,,961,4.465909090909091
8521946,5,B007UDOGX2,"I'm so glad I took a chance on these DVDs and ordered them from the US. Now on session 6 I'm finding finally a way to heal my body and grow stronger without the risk of reaching a certain point and then crashing back to square one. Dr Lam has been spot on for me so far in his advice and information about AFS and I will continue to access his guidance as I progress, either about diet, herbal supplementation or exercise. Feeling hopeful again. Highly recommended.",1485475200,4,465,4.35632183908046
8521947,5,B007UDOGX2,Great product!!!,1464048000,,16,7.5
8521948,5,B007UDOGX2,"How could I ever recover without this video series.  From complete adrenal exhaustion to session 3 in 8 months.  It may seem like a slow progress, but I was nearly dead.  I think the advice to not move on until the current lesson is easy for you is great advice.  It may seem very redundant, but the disappointment of pushing yourself into a crash, by moving forward, is so very difficult to deal with when you already feel so low.",1459296000,9,431,4.35
8521949,5,B007UDOGX2,"Finally an exercise program I can actually do, after years of causing adrenal crashes after exercising in the wrong way! I am already seeing differences in my health after just a few weeks.",1437523200,9,189,4.757575757575758
8521950,5,B007UDOGX2,"Excellent so far but just finishing session 4 of the first of the 4 DVD's. I've taken it slow but have been consistent at it every day, as I've been in a semi crashed adrenal state for a month. Definitely seeing improved health! For myself, I move on to the the next session when the current session is easy to do. You have to crank up the volume for sure!",1433980800,9,356,4.1
8521951,5,B007UDOGX2,Excellent program. Each session builds on previous sessions. I stay with a session until I have mastered it and them I go on. Dr Lam's voice is soothing and helpful with explaining the moves.,1412640000,5,191,4.647058823529412
8521952,4,B007UDOGX2,"The concept seems very simple, but why then don't we just do it ? I wish I could hear the narrator more clearly, but his tone is wonderful. This seems really simply, but it's not easy. I love popping them in the player & concentrating on something so important for myself.",1380499200,9,272,4.352941176470588
