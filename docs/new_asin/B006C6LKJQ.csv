8496350,1,B006C6LKJQ,"This series is all about stealing as much material as possible. The first half of the first episode is lifted directly from a history website, and the second half is--I kid you not--lifted word for word from the Wikipedia article on Saddam Hussein. You can read along! Fun for kids! And copyright lawyers!

Plus, all the music is lifted from feature film soundtracks. God help the producers of this series if John Williams ever gets whiff of it.",1386806400,,445,4.705128205128205
8496351,2,B006C6LKJQ,"Wars against Saddam at first started out historically great in delivering accurate information on Mesopotamian and Muslim history right up to the Iraqi Bath Party. I thought wow this is going to turn out to be a great series. Sure it was a little dry at times but what history isn't at certain segments. They were covering things I learned at the University and Mastered plus reading other historical references. Then it happened; the (New) left wing revisionist history started regurgitating bias history, political propaganda slants, and perceptual lies for political recruitment and seedling indoctrination. Any ""historian"" who decorates President Carter with Middle East honors in foreign policy...well frankly, is ludicrous or distorted themselves. And that is what the producer communicates in the first DVD during ""America held Captive, Path to War"". Plus any historian who attempts to diminish President Reagan's precedence and very honorable terms in office...well just because Reagan was a republican and a conservative who turned the Nation around out financial crisis and brought down the Soviet Union...are sadly chomping at the democrat far left wing social communist of marxist historian bit. Pull your cart of B.S. back to Joe Klein stupidity. Unfortunately this is what the Producer Edward Feuerherd and Dr. Rodger Payne, a University professor from Louisville Kentucky who has a personal Blog site but not listed in Wikipedia, pamphleteer in the first DVD (of 5)...strange both Producer and Professor come from Louisville Kentucky. There is no acknowledgement of President Reagan's accomplishments. I will give Wars against Saddam a half point for the `Producers' having Dr. Charles Ziegler share a couple of his historical discernments. Between the narrator and tag teaming Payne (also the name of a well known pamphleteer) the story is sided.  But if Disc 2 starts regurgitating new left wing historical crap/slants/propaganda/bias or revisionist history, we all can assume that disk 3,4, and 5 will no doubt suggest that it was all the United States fault, even 911...or its all the Republican's fault and everything is President Bush's fault.

  I'm giving it a two star just because of the historical footage...but not for the cinematic quality. I could have created a better historical documentary on my Sony laptop using a basic video editor. Oh yah, and there are a lot of grammatical and some reference errors in this DVD package. It was like they rushed to get it out...their side of the story.

  I may slush my way through this series and if they get off the left wing historical political world view I may raise War against Saddam an extra Star. Oh yah, I was there for most of this war.

Disk 2:
  Charles Zielger is turning out to be a ""I think this was that...not sure of the exact date...as I recall it,"" historically wishy washy while Payne, promotes his book `""Bush ""The War on Terror,"" the mouth piece and authority of the subject. Oh and Payne mistakenly says that Iraq bought almost all of their military weaponry from...Saudi Arabia??? I think he meant to say the Soviets. Truly Payne, it can be observed, just too in love with himself and promoting his personal views on history.

  The only interesting things on disk 2 are the interviews, reflections and personal histories from the soldiers of the first war on Saddam. One interesting history being from Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert, both soldiers in the war, who couldn't get married, in the desert, in Saudi Arabia because it would be a Christian Marriage, and only Muslims can get married in Saudi Arabia, so they got married in Bahrain. For the personal histories of soldiers I'm rasing it to 2.5 stars.",1332979200,,3694,5.055921052631579
