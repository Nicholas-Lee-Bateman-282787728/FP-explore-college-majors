8515262,4,B007EG9IZQ,"I went in expecting a travesty based on the 1 star review below.  But sound and video quality are not TERRIBLE by any means, though nor are they blu-ray quality.  It's about TV level quality.  In some cases if you pay attention closely you see the film is of low digital pixel quality.  However i didn't find this horribly distracting for the most part.  I've seen worse bootlegs.  And the sound is fine basically, again as long as you're not expecting some super hi-def audiophile production.  This 2006 Latin American concert is a picture of Waters at the time.  He's rolling through some of the great Pink Floyd material here.  In fact 10 of the 12 songs presented here are Floyd numbers, many of which he still pulls off, and in others he leaves some of the higher octave work to the backup singers.

Waters' words today are as poignant as they ever were, if not more.  From 'The Gunner's Dream"":

""A place to stay
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud about you doubts and fears, and what's more
No one ever disappears, you never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax
On both sides of the tracks
And maniacs
don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore..""

Or how about the Fletcher Memorial Home:

""Take all your overgrown infants away
Somewhere
And build them a home
A little place of their own..
The Fletcher Memorial, home for incurable tyrants,
and kings

They could appear to themselves every day
on closed circuit TV
to make sure they're still real..
It's the only connection
they feel

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Reagan and Haig
Mr Begin and friends
Mrs Thatcher and Paisley
Mr Brezhnev and party
The ghost of McCarthy
The memories of Nixon
And now, and in color, a group of anonymous Latin American meat-packing glitterati...

Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?

They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles
and amuse themselves playing games for a while
Boom boom, bang bang
Lie down - you're dead

Safe in the permanent gaze
of a cold glass eye
Their favorite toy
They'll be good girls and boys
In the Fletcher Memorial Home For Colonial Wasters of Life
and Limb
Is everyone in?
Are you having a nice time?
Now, the final solution can be applied""

Needless to say, Waters' performance on these two Final Cut classics are spellbinding, and also still well within his range in this 2006 performance so he covers them well.  Hard to believe Gilmore ever dissed on this album, one of my all-time Pink Floyd favorites, and I know I'm not alone in this.  But it's amazing how well these songs hold up to today.  Somebody needs to create that Fletcher Memorial Home.  ""Fletcher"", according to Wikipedia, was written in honor of Waters' father, Eric Fletcher Waters who died during the 2nd World War.  Fletcher was also the maiden name of Eric Waters' mother.

Incidentally, the songs that follow are solo Waters numbers which I'd never heard before ""Perfect Sense"" and ""Leaving Beirut"".  Both really good.  And of course, ending the show on ""Sheep"" is a perfect close.",1497398400,,3413,4.595041322314049
