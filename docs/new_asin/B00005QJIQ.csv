7950835,4,B00005QJIQ,"This movie is interesting.  It's not as serious themed as other asian movies like black magic but it does deal with black magic.  It's more of a dark comedy and erotic themed movie, than a serious movie about black magic.  Overall not a bad movie.",1351641600,,247,4.444444444444445
7950836,3,B00005QJIQ,"I have to admit I don't really understand the appeal of HK cinema.  There have only been a couple I have really enjoyed, and this isn't one of them. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be a sophmoric comedy, a horror show, or some soft-core erotic flick. To some people this jumble might be an exciting show, to me it is a boring mess. It is decidely different from anything you'd get from Hollywood, so that must be at least part of the appeal.",1189296000,,448,4.209302325581396
7950837,4,B00005QJIQ,"Most Chinese ghost stories have rather lame plots. This movie is one of the better written ones. A more appropriate translation of the Chinese title would be ""Southeast Asia's 10 Evil Spells"". Or Thai Black Magic.

Strange things happen to a group of friends in Hongkong. One killed his entire family. The luckier one suffers from impotence. His frustrated and beautiful girlfriend questions him and realises that they have offended a voodoo practitioner while they were on a trip to Thailand not too long ago...

The subplot brings us into the exotic world of Thai black magic. A kind-hearted voodoo practitioner uses his skills to fight the evil practitioners. He meets and befriends the group from Hongkong. He invites them to his house and his younger sister becomes infatuated with one of the men named Pong. She plans to cast a love spell on him but accidentally gets the other men afflicted. They rape her and she commits suicide. The men flee to Hongkong. Blaming his sister's death on the callous men, the voodoo master goes to Hongkong with revenge on his mind.

Back in Hongkong, Pong and his hairstylist girlfriend (played by Ellen Chan), are worried what the Thai voodoo master would do next. True enough, Ellen's brother (one of the men in the group) gets killed. Another member eats himself alive. The taste of revenge makes the orginally kind-hearted voodoo practitioner more and more bloodthirsty and lustful, hungry for Ellen's body.

One of Ellen's clients at the salon happens to be a Thai withcraft practitioner herself. She finds out about the situation and offers to help. What follows is a battle between the 2 Thai masters. That's when things get really bizarre and unbelievable, but I guess the audience waiting to see Ellen Chan naked would not complain too much.

Overall, it's quite a well-done horror flick. Low budget special effects but watchable by Hongkong mass market standards.

Don't anger their voodoo people - you just might come back with something missing, if you come back at all, that is...Three stars!",1170374400,,250,4.790697674418604
7950839,4,B00005QJIQ,"~After being chased by gangsters, four Chinese tourists in Thailand take refuge with a Thai voodoo master.  They have a good relationship with the voodoo master at first; however, things change after the voodoo master's sister falls in love with one of the four: Pon, who is engaged to a woman back in Hong Kong.  She asks her brother for a love potion to give Pon, but the other three drink the potion by mistake.  The love potion makes them go crazy with lust, and they gang rape her. The voodoo~~ master then follows the four back to Hong Kong where he targets them, one by one, for gruesome death.
  After the three rapists are down, the last of the group, Pon, gets help from his fiancee's Thai witch friend.  The Thai witch vows to defend Pon, and, of course, we end up with a battle between the Thai witch and voodoo master.
  The film is highly entertaining and certainly not boring.  I would recommend it to anyone who thinks my description above sounds interesting.~",1081123200,42,976,4.531428571428571
