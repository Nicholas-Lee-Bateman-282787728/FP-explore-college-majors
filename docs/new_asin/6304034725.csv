TRUE story of how this guy Meier was SHOT at and almost killed for telling the TRUTH, also shows actual pictures of the UFO ships and people (who looks exactly like US). This is an excellent video, i would recommend to anyone.",1320451200,,335,4.25
7861810,5,6304034725,Twenty years ago I heard of Billy Meier and his story. I recently re-acquainted myself with it and purchased this volume to give myself another look and see what I made of it from the position of an interested observer. I heard somewhere that the Pleiadeans gave the unbelievers an out by making their demonstrations refutable. This was given in fairness and care as to not frighten those not yet ready to accept the truth. I happen to believe this story is true. I also respect those who don't believe it. Personally I cannot see why a man of intelligence and empathy for others including his wife and family would go ahead and put them through such stress in passing this information on to the public if it wasn't true. This experience has basically consumed Billy Meier's whole world. I don't think he's lying. That's my opinion.,1304294400,,832,4.666666666666667
7861811,5,6304034725,"If it was not for the investigative team that consisted of Wendelle Stevens, Lee and Brit Elders, and Thomas Welch, the rare footage contained in this video set would likely not have ever even made it here to the United States.  That, in itself, makes the ability to see these videos on one's own television something very unique and special.  What is contained in these two video tapes is footage of alleged alien visitation to a contactee named Billy Meier.  Much scientific investigation and analysis has been conducted on the photos and videos contained within this film and published in other works that are very rare, hard to find, and often very expensive.  Watching these videos brings the story and evidence much more to life than by just reading about it in the other works that have been published on the case.  It gives the viewer a chance to get a stronger feel of what kind of man Billy Meier is, having the ability to assess his character and demeanor as he is interviewed, as well as the credibility of the investigative team that was put on the case.  This is the best means that the average person will ever have of examining the photographic and video evidence of alleged alien spaceships surrounding this controversial case.  Viewing these videos first-hand, as opposed to just reading about the opinions of others who have examined them, should give the viewer a much better stance of determining whether or not the photographic and video evidence produced by Billy Meier truly shows that of extraterrestrial visitation or that of a very elaborate hoax.  Considering what these videos are currently selling for as of 2/4/08, anybody interested to learn more about the Billy Meier case who does not already have these videos should not pass these up.",1202083200,3,1770,4.837748344370861
7861812,3,6304034725,"This video tells the story of Pleidian contactee Billy Meier, which is somewhat interesting if you can get past the poor film quality. If you have a short attention span then this two-cassette VHS is not for you. There are some informational gems here and there, but it takes quite a bit of patience to watch it all the way through. The videographer should have taken a class in storytelling before attempting this one.",1025740800,,419,4.675675675675675
