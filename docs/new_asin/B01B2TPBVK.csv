7621540,4,B01B2TPBVK,"Powerful compassion and empathy from someone who has no one to care for him other than his own patients.  He carries a deep and torturing secret of something he does not regret doing, but moans the need to have done it.
I got this from my local library, but it is well worth owning.  If I am ever on either end of end-of-life care taking or car giving, I want Tim Roth's portrayal to be a guiding example of the giver.",1490140800,,418,4.148148148148148
7621541,1,B01B2TPBVK,"I've been a caregiver for a terminally ill person so I get it, but this movie is simply depressing. It barely explains anything, and the ending was, well honestly, I don't even have the words for that ridiculous ending.",1489708800,,219,4.641025641025641
7621542,4,B01B2TPBVK,"If you have ever taken care of someone or contemplating doing so, who has a terminal illness, this makes sense. Powerful performance by Tim Roth.",1489104000,6,145,4.84

I think maybe both.",1480809600,,154,4.310344827586207
7621544,4,B01B2TPBVK,"David( Tim Roth) is a homecare nurse for terminal patients. He moves from one to the other, when the preceding one has passed away. We see him at 1st with Sarah, who is wasted away with Aids, hes bathing her (she cant wash or feed herself). There is no voiceover, no back-story, we deduce gradually, that he might be some kind of nurse, as he bathes her body, in a very close, intimate way. Its a case of show, don't tell, certainly Davids responses, play things close to his chest. Hes seen attending a funeral, its of Sarah, but he avoids getting too close to her relatives, plays it coolly, is mysterious, impassive. Why does he tell two strangers in a bar, hes just lost his wife, Sarah from Aids? Later he tells a bookshop assistant hes an architect, like his stroke patient John. These two fictional falsehoods make us wonder about his motivation. Is he a sociopath, or is the tension of doing such daytime work with the dying in need of such an emotional release? Franco, the Mexican director, is of the minimalist school, treating difficult, uncharted territory in film language. David has no life outside of the work for which he shows great empathy and dedication. Roth seems to be not acting at all, but performing an authentic role. We see him in close up side-on in his car, or jogging the streets. David seems to be hiding from something in his own past or life. He shows genuine emotion when reconciled with his college-age daughter. Is he atoning for something that happened to him? He comes to grief with Johns family (whomJohn cant stand) by allowing him to watch pornography, or spending too much time with him. Johns family sue David for sexual harassment. His next patient is cancer sufferer Martha, who wants to end her chemotherapy as her cancer has spread. She seeks his help in ending her life. She vomits and messes herself.

David is the introverted loner, awkward outside his work. It seems he needs his patients as much as they need him; he appears to transgress boundaries between himself and his patients, that make for uncomfortable viewing. There is confusion between drama and a documentary approach to the subject matter. The mortality we will all face starkly is up against acute character observations, which is resolved in a most unsatisfactory way, as if the director had lost his nerve and hastened the end. Comparable to Haneke's Amour. This is Roths best work in ages. Winner of the best screenplay award Cannes 2015. Beautiful illumination of interiors with natural light, superb use of static framing to
show scenes loaded with meaning for the characters in each scene.",1463702400,8,2613,4.755506607929515

8749160,5,B01B2TPBVK,"""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""The Hateful Eight"" and other movies starring Tim Roth are exciting to watch, since you never know what his character will do next. The Actor is as unpredictable as Angelina Jolie or Robert De Niro. This film is not different. The direction reminds of Michel Haneke or Lars von Trier. Very subjective, the viewer feels la little bit like a voyeur, not being able to understand what exactly is going on and whether one should root for the main character. Bit by bit we learn more about Tim Roth's character and his motivation. ""Chronic"" offers also a priceless examination of the business of health care. If you are a fan of Sir Alfred Hitchcock or Brian De Palma, you will enjoy this film to the (very surprising) end.

8749162,3,B01B2TPBVK,"It was nominated for best picture and best lead actor, along with winners - Moonlight and Casey Affleck, for Independent Spirit Awards, and did win best screenplay at Cannes (with hardly any talk, and most just mumbling). I do like psychological character studies, thus it did hold my interest, but more out of what the heck is the film's message, than anything else.",1497139200,,367,4.841269841269841

8749164,2,B01B2TPBVK,The worst crappy senseless ending I have watched in a long time!  Hospice and care givers are very special people and the only way you find this out is when you are confronted with this in your real life.  These wonderful people don't do it for the money because the pay is not worth it for the pain and stress they go through!,1493596800,3,327,4.174603174603175
8749165,4,B01B2TPBVK,"Interesting movie about care of end of life patients. The care provider has some baggage from his life that makes him a pretty sad guy, but his most compassionate care for his clients is pretty incredible. Movie moves slowly, but that seems to fit perfectly with the subject matter of people wrapping up their lives, waiting to die, with dignity. The main character provides that kind and compassionate care during the bridge between life and death. Not a movie for everyone, but worth watching if you fear not about death. The very intimate care of body and mind of his patients is powerfully good.",1492128000,3,599,4.769230769230769
8749166,5,B01B2TPBVK,"Tim Roth delivers a quiet, nuanced performance; one that will stay with you for quite awhile. As someone who is now in the position of helping my parents more and more as they age, I found this to be a very powerful movie and I have a newfound respect for anyone who does this on a daily basis. Five stars does not do it justice.",1491091200,2,329,4.076923076923077
8749167,1,B01B2TPBVK,This movie is offensive and degrading to the terminally ill and their families. Copy-catting the Ghost Writer ending and the death scene from Million Dollar Baby was in very bad taste. I would advise intelligent and sensitive people to steer clear of this boring false portrayal of life's end.,1490572800,,293,5.0
