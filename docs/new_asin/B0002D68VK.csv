8026494,4,B0002D68VK,"Ken Hackathorn talks about 2-stupid mistakes commonly made by those who carry concealed handguns and what he calls short term and long term modes of concealment for carrying a handgun concealed.
He also mentions 3-recognizable visual signs that might indicate that someone is carrying a concealed handgun.

Several concealed carry holsters and methods are shown and Ken Hackathorn talks a little about each one: inside the pants, pancake holster, Bruce Nelson #1 holster, shoulder holster, fanny pack holsters, pocket holsters, ankle holsters, paddle holsters and belly band holsters.

Ken Hackathorn demonstrates some methods of drawing the gun from concealment: sweep draw and snatch draw.

The process of drawing the gun is broken down into simpler component actions for the concealed handgun owner to practice.

The instructional part of the video is 80 minutes long or 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Afterwards there are some video promotions of other gun videos produced by Lenny Magill.
