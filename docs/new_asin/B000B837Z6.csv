2407754,3,B000B837Z6,"Season 4 was a bit of a change in pace after the breathless pace of the previous seasons. While brilliant and better than almost every other cop show it fails to reach the brilliance of previous season for a few reasons.

Antwone Mitchell's character as stated in various reviews is a total failure. The guy simply is not upto par with the previous baddies such as Amadeo and Margos which the Strike Team has encountered. Things are also not helped by Anthony Andersons lacklustre performance and lack of subtlety. The actor simply does not have the chops to convince as a hardened drug dealer or community leader. Vhing Rhames or Micheal Clarke Duncan would have been brillaint in the role and more upto the task of going toe to toe with Micheal Chiklis.

Lack of intensity. After previous seasons's breathless storyline which involed the Armenian mob, Aceveda's rape, Shane's girlfriend and other brilliant storylines this season was simply flat. It picks up in the middle with Shane seemingly out to take out Vic but once the Strike Team in re-united there simply aren't enouhg obstacles in thier path.

All in all a disapointment but save as ever by Micheal Chiklis and this year Glen Close. I hope the writers learn from thier mistakes and give the Shield the proper season 5 and finale it deserves.",1134604800,4,1304,4.786666666666667
2407755,2,B000B837Z6,"The Shield's fourth season was disappointing on a number of levels. After the shake-up that left the strike team broke, angry, and distrustful at the end of Season 3, I expected something different for Season 4. Instead, Chiklis & Co. just spent half a season working back to the status quo. Glenn Close's addition to the cast provided some much-needed media attention, but it also shoved the better actors on the cast (CCH Pounder, Benito Martinez, Jay Karnes, and Michael Jace) onto the sidelines.

The focus on Walton Goggins' increasingly tiresome Shane was unwelcome. Here's a guy who gives even rogue cops a bad name. And Anthony Anderson, although he displayed great range, played a character whose storyline was needlessly padded to fill out the season.

Even a lesser season of the Shield is more intense than most cop shows on TV, especially in the procedural-heavy times. But I think the show may be approaching its expiration date. Ultimately, the Shield can only end one way: With Vic and the strike team paying in some way for their crimes. Vic, especially, needs to pay for the undercover cop he murdered in the first episode. I think that with Chiklis getting more accustomed to wearing the latex Thing suit, he will be pursuing more film work. They seem to be preparing us for the possible endgame in Season 5. If so, that's fine. Just no more running in place like season 4. Go out with the bang we know you're capable of.",1134518400,7,1440,4.733067729083666
2407756,4,B000B837Z6,"I still believe that this show is the best thing on TV and I can't wait for Season 5. Unfortunately it is not always possible to improve on things that begin so well, and Season One was a hard act to follow. The first three seasons managed to sustain the impact and quality of the first and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. It is obvious that they tried something different with this season, and let's be honest, if they hadn't wouldn't we be thinking they should? For me, I thought Rawlings was a good character and that Glen Close did a great job. Antwone Michell, however, was a pretty weak choice and he certainly didn't deserve a full season. I felt the Season could have benefitted from a few more influencial bad guys. I was bored and unaffected by Antwone by the end. Shane should have done the deed in the cell and made way for more interesting characters... but then I'm not a scriptwriter and I have faith that they have learned from the few flaws in an otherwise perfect show and will make ammends. Of course we miss the Strike Team of old but life does go on. I'm sure there will be a return to the upper realms of greatness next time. I'm still buying this as it beats most of what else is out there.",1133222400,4,1217,4.318777292576419
2407757,3,B000B837Z6,"I agree with a lot of the other reviewers. Sadly, hollywood did invade the mean streets of L.A. and the dirty halls of Farmington, and I agree that we should always focus on the regular characters, not an entire season of two people who won't even be back this season. It is weak, even as it is sprinkled with good moments.

I liked the Shane arc; interesting, believable and intense, it just kicked home how inept Shane is and unable to stand on his own two feet, considering his proclivity to racism and underhanded remarks, I wasn't sad to see him fail.

Could have done without the Aceveda/sex shame/rape story line, I think he could have been better used another way, though it was interesting, character wise, to see how he chose to deal with the events.

I missed the days of the Vic/Claudette hate, and there was not nearly enough of Claudette, her arc barely surfaced.

Antwon Mitchell had good moments, but like one reviewer said, some subtly was in store. He's a good actor, but overplayed the part to some degree; I believe Antwon would have been a lot cooler all the time, even when caught.

I do miss the old Strike team when they were stealing drugs, hording money, bitching drug dealers, and being a close knit group of friends. Honestly, I didn't really like the arc of the stolen money being marked, but it made for very raw and intense moments within the group, like Lem's breakdown and Shane making a remark about Vic being a weekend dad.

Chiklis is fantastic and why I watch the show, I love him, despite his corupt ways, I root for him always. I hope season 5 goes back to old, I'm not sure what they were thinking for S4. I'll probably buy it to have a set, but it is by far, the weakest most wasted talent season.",1132790400,6,1738,4.432601880877743
2407758,2,B000B837Z6,"This was probably the weakest of the four seasons.  They tried to make it work with many many subplots, but it just didn't mesh this year.

Wasn't a big fan of Antwan Mitchell either.  Not the greatest villian in the world.  He had nothin on Armadillo (arm-a-dee-o) from season 2.

I've just become so used to havin those ""OHHH DAAAMN"" moments watchin this show, this season just didn't produce any emotion from me.  Maybe two or three episodes at most.  Hopefully they'll recapture the magic of season 1 & 2 next year.  Btw, people bash season 3, but I liked it.  Good storyline, good actin, good action.  What more do you want?  Anyway, guess my order goes 2-1-3-4.

Also, I agree that Tony Soprano is the best character on tv.  He just has so many layers it's great.  Then Vic Mackey, then Jed Bartlet.  That's my two cents.",1132358400,8,827,4.493243243243243
2407759,5,B000B837Z6,"At the end of the third season of FX's the Shield, crooked cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) and his strike team split up.  As the fourth season opens, the Farmington precinct meets their new captain in Monica Rawling (Glenn Close), and it's not long before she makes herself noticed.  With Aceveda (Benito Martinez) on his way to political office, Rawling makes her presence felt re-organizing the force with Vic as her right hand man, and they both put their sights on charismatic drug dealer Antwan Mitchell (Anthony Anderson).  In the meantime, Vic's ex-partner Shane (Walt Goggins) works vice, and gets in way too deep with Mitchell, which leads to the reformation of the strike team in an effort to save Shane, and themselves, before it's too late.  Sub-plots throughout the season include Aceveda discovering a dark side he never knew he had, Julian (Michael Jace) looking to be transfered as he opposes Rawling's approach to the seizures, and Dutch (Jay Karnes) finding romance with Vic's ex-wife (Cathy Cahlin Ryan) while trying to get both his partner (CCH Pounder) and himself out of the doghouse with the DA.  Many agree that the third season was a step down compared to the landmark first two, and the fourth season delivers firing on all cylinders.  Glenn Close is perfect casting as the no-nonsense new captain, while Michael Chiklis is excellent as always as crooked cop Mackey, who this season, appears to be searching for redemption.  The Shield is back on track, and it's once again the best original drama on cable TV.  By the end of the season, there is a big change for all the main players, and it will leave you salivating for what's coming next.",1126656000,82,1669,4.831578947368421
2407760,5,B000B837Z6,"This season was not my favorite but it was still good the way the strike team was separated. Vic is the best character on tv next to Tony Soprano. I love this show but Glenn Close was a little scary in it. She did very well in her role. I thought she was going to suck but there was good tension between her and Vic. Also, I think DutchBoy is the most annoying and him teaming up with Vic's wife was a great way for me to see what a tool that guy really is. But I think they could have found a prettier wife for Vic. She is not really that cute. He usually finds better looking chicks. Well, I think that this show deserves 4 stars but I am giving it 5 because of the rules they break in every episode. The language and sexual content is shocking at times because it is on regular cable but that's why I love it. If you are easily offended, this might not be the best show for you. But if you like action, tough guys, cops kicking butt, or just great writing, start with 1 and work your way through. I guarantee that once you start you will not want to stop. Not for kids though, make sure they are asleep for the night.",1125964800,4,1120,4.004464285714286

My review:
Well, that Vick sure has himself in another mess. His new boss is counting him to fix up some troubles, but she knows he's not to be trusted. I've got a sneaking suspicion that Vick and the new boss will get intimate.

And what about that hillbilly guy, Cletus Van Dam? He's gonna get his butt in a situation he can't fix and then Vick will have to bail him out. Cletus is too mean and stupid to run a successful scam for long.

It is not as if I was expecting her to be bad.  I expected a good performance.  She still managed to exceed all of my expectations.

This season of The Shield was fantastic, as usual.  I just discovered this show 1 month ago and I have already completed the series.  In a very short amount of time the show and its' characters have staked a claim on my heart.

2407984,5,B000B837Z6,"The TV Series ""The Shield"" (8 seasons -  each better than the last) is undoubtedly the most innovative, captivating, and addictive
film production ever filmed for the entertainment of the public!  LA Detective renegade Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis)
leads  the special 4-man ""Strike Force Team,"" all members of which are outstanding actors, and the secondary
cast of about a half-dozen other officers and detectives also are fantastic.  The realistic 45-60 minute plots (thank goodness for Amazon Prime which eliminates any commercials which would destroy the flow) generally consist of 2 or 3 unrelated but interwoven stories (intertwined with other episodes) involving the LA detectives and officers  outsmarting and convicting (by intellect and/or deception) the criminals (organized groups and individuals) who commit (or perhaps don't commit) unspeakable atrocities against humanity.  The focus  and most interesting aspect of the series, however,  is the  shifting  and continuous loyalties and betrayals among the staff,  with  it being left up to the viewer to determine  who are ""the good cops"" and who are ""the bad cops""  -  not an easy decision. Each character is multi-dimensional, displaying  extreme virtues and vices,  just as in real life.  Watch ""The Shield""  in the order filmed, and even people such as myself who "" watch no TV""  will watch every episode of every season.  Just think of the best  dramatic book or best  dramatic movie you have ever enjoyed, and ""The Shield""  will challenge it as ""the best  drama""  you've ever enjoyed.",1409443200,,1553,5.288065843621399

2408027,1,B000B837Z6,"The Strike Team is always committing more crimes in order to cover up the crimes that they have committed in the past.  It is a never ending spiral from bad cops to worse cops.  And the guys chasing them are as bad as they are.  There are a few good guys in this series, but it only makes the crap that the Strike Team is doing appear even worse.  No redeeming features in this show.",1401667200,,383,4.066666666666666

2408031,3,B000B837Z6,"I especially enjoyed Seasons 1 to 3 of The Shield, but I found myself losing interest in the series during the 4th season.  The plots didn't make me want to watch each new episode--that I think was the gist of my feeling.  I enjoyed Glenn Close's acting.

2408040,4,B000B837Z6,The Shield is the second best cop show ever. Its like the rated R version of Law and Order. Michael Chikilis is a bad ass. Don't watch if you are a pussy. You really need to watch seasons 1 thru 3 to really get it.,1397260800,,214,3.7777777777777777

2408047,5,B000B837Z6,"This has got to be the epitome of detective/police shows. Lots of action, some pretty graphic, and never a dull moment. Its difficult not to take sides watching this show, and those sides can change as the real intentions of the individuals are revealed and the show progresses. Lots of good cop, bad cop, and some perceived reality of the pressures that police work under politically, budget wise, and in the field. Plenty of use of socioeconomic conditions and how they might affect crime and the quality of life in the precinct. Different from cutesy and humorous whodunit detective shows, even those with mild to full violence, as this shows the police fighting back using the criminals own tactics, and a little self-interest that comes from being underpaid and overworked when temptation overcomes their core values. Highly recommended!",1396137600,,842,5.108695652173913

2408054,2,B000B837Z6,"Initially I started watching the Shield out of boredom. I like some of the characters,but by season 4 the plot line for me is redundant. I can't stand Chiklis' role as Vic MAckey. He is arrogant and narcissistic, not to mention violent. I don't like the constant screaming and bloody scenes. Other police stories have made their point without all that . On the SHield it's as if the plot never changes. Like a soap opera I could stop watching, then pick it up again and not have missed anything. Some people love this show and I respect that. I am just not one of them. I prefer shows with a bit more sophistication and less vulgarities and blood.",1394755200,,647,4.445378151260504

2408056,5,B000B837Z6,I stumbled onto this show while unemployed. This has to be one of the best shows ever. Period. It ranks up there with Breaking Bad (and in my opinion a lot more gritty/realistic). The documentary-style camera work makes the show feel fresh and gives the viewer a fly-on-the-wall look at Vic Mackey and his crew. DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW. IF YOU CAN WATCH IT.,1394150400,,355,4.476923076923077

2408064,5,B000B837Z6,shows the world as it is-very thin line between good and bad...cops and criminals are very much alike in a lot of ways,1392681600,,118,4.173913043478261
2408065,3,B000B837Z6,"First, the good news: by the end of this season, Mackey and the boys are back doing what they do best. And really, any of The Shield is just good television.

The bad news: after a phenomenal first three seasons, the fourth is comparatively leaden and single-minded. For me it was a shock. The fast-paced formula juggling the Strike Team, Wagenbach/Whims and supporting cast is mostly absent for the first ten episodes. It makes sense: Glenn Close is heavy freight, and it seems as if her character took most of the oxygen from writing and blocking, leaving the balance for Mackey and almost nothing for side stories on rank-and-file. That's a problem if those features are exactly what've kept you coming back, shaking your head and saying, ""Wow"" every fifteen minutes. Pacing is slow, and at a few low points characters follow motivations only because they're following the script.

But don't worry. Nobody running the show lost control. The season arc follows the path you might've expected when the Strike Team's luck nearly ran out in S3; it also chronicles the bold experiment carried out by Close's Monica Rawling, who at least twice gazes into the abyss Mackey long since swan-dived into. Just don't be surprised if Season 4 hits you differently, and in the wrong way; and don't give up, either.",1392508800,2,1303,4.864864864864865

Trying to save them mostly from people who like himself pray on weakness he schemes and acts on these often ill advised plans without caring who may be hurt in the long run. Is  Breaking Bads Walter White patterned after this character? I see some real similarities which would put this show in the upper stratosphere of tv history. Good acting and writing cannot be beat. Great show.,1379030400,,531,4.589473684210526

2408310,5,B000B837Z6,"The Complete Fourth Season of the Shield is in retrospect kind of painful to watch, knowing how the whole thing ends.  But Glenn Close and Michael Chiklis have great chemistry, as Monica Rawling (Close) arrives at the Barn with a few agendas she is determined to push through, even at the cost of her own career.  (In this sense, she's not unlike Vic.)

One of these agendas is to put Antwon Mitchell (one of the most evil characters I've seen in any television show) in prison for the rest of his life.  Anderson does a superb job of playing this specimen, who pretends to be a community organizer by day and is a vicious drug dealing  gangster by night.  Most of the villains in this show really aren't worse or necessarily as bad as Vic, when you take a close look, but this guy cuts the cake.  His execution of a young girl with Shane and Army's weapons is probably, along with Dutch choking the cat out, the most graphic scene in the series.  (Or was it Ronnie being taken away to prison?)

Rawlings has a personal history with Antwon, her deceased husband (also a cop) promising to piss on the scumbag's grave but having gone to an early death because of cancer.  It's clear that as smart as Vic is and as acutely aware of any threat to ""him or his"", the Strike Team or his family, Monica Rawlings is using Vic as much as he is using her.  First, she provides the motivation Vic needs to put a rapist out of commission, and quite colorfully at that.  Then when Shane screws everything up (as always) and thinks he can tax Mitchell on the street, the Strike Team becomes divided and caught in some mighty sticky situations.  Vic needs Monica to put Antwon behind bars to keep everyone--especially himself--safe from Antwon's street reach.

This is one of the few times in the series that you see Vic Mackey really take care of business for the right side of the law.  He's still doing corrupt things of course and indirectly encouraging others to do them, but a lot of what he does here is straight police work.  Rawlings warns him towards the end of the series that he better take a good look at where he's going in life and that she never really got to ""finish"" something she had started with him.  Mackey understands on some level of what she's trying to do, but is unable or unwilling to finish that work himself.

A must if you love ""The Shield"".  I could not stop watching every episode and like another reviewer here would become sleep deprived in order to do so.  As compelling as ""The Wire"".",1363132800,,2505,4.439824945295404

2408315,1,B000B837Z6,"I bought The Shield Season 4.  I had already bought Seasons 2 and 3.  I had been very happy with the purchases,however, when I got ready to watch the third disk of Season 4 it did not work.(It had not been removed from the case until I put it in the player.)  I even took it to a video store and had the disk polished to remove any scratches.  It still did not work.  I am very disappointed.",1342915200,,391,3.9615384615384617
2408316,4,B000B837Z6,"This season starts off somewhat slowly as we discover that the Strike Team has been splintered as Vic & Ronnie work together on detective duty while Lem & Shane have transferred out to other divisions.  Aceveda finally begins his tenure on City Council and his vacant position is filled by a new female captain, Monica Rawling (Glenn Close) whose controversial ideas shake up the community and divide the officers at The Barn. Vic had hoped to secure a high profile position in another division but a damaging assessment letter from Aceveda tanks the transfer so Vic scrambles to get himself into the good graces of Capt Rawling who has researched the Strike Team and has great reservations about Vic.

Another new character, Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson) returns to Farmington after a 13 yr prison stint and almost immediately we discover the deep animosity between him and Capt Rawling due to their past dealings.  Anderson was terrific in this role as he initially portrayed himself as a reformed convict who just wanted to do good works in the neighborhood and then flipped into a convincingly menacing gang leader.

I read a previous review in which the person stated that a more imposing actor such as Ving Rhames or Michael Clark Duncan would've done the Antwon Mitchell role more justice.  I respectfully disagree - although both Rhames and Duncan ARE more physically imposing than Anderson and arguably would've been terrifying personas, the fact that Anderson is not as muscular of a man makes it more believable that he was someone who could be ""punked"".

Shane & his new partner are running wild in the streets as they shake down gang affiliated pimps and ultimately try this ploy with Antwon Mitchell with tragic consequences.  The danger that Shane faces brings the Strike Team back together to save him.  I have to give the actor portraying Shane (Walton Goggins) mad props for his performance this season.  Although I despise the Shane character, Goggins portrayal runs the gamut from a cocky Vic wannabe to a desperate cowering man begging for help from his friends to get out of a dangerous jam (AGAIN, remembering the Tayvon incident).

The supporting characters' storylines include: Aceveda's obsession with a prostitute as he tries to work out issues stemming from his assault; Dutch & Claudette are blackballed by the D.A.'s office and put on less high profile cases as a result and Dani & Julian clash over the controversial asset forfeiture program instituted by Capt. Rawling.

One thing I also must comment on was the overwhelmingly negative portrayals of Black women this season.  We had a shady A.D.A. who blackmails Dutch so that he and Claudette can work on better cases; an uncaring Children Protective Services supervisor; an AIDS infected prostitute, etc.  With the exception of Det Wymms, there was not one positive portrayal of a Black woman this season and that bothered me greatly as I watched this 13-episode season in basically one sitting.

On the positive side again this set contains tons of extras including episodic commentary from the cast, creator & writers; deleted scenes, a documentary on the making of this season and featurettes.",1327708800,,3185,5.018975332068311
2408317,5,B000B837Z6,"This Los Angeles Police Department is rotten to the core, not by rotten cops but by politics especially since the ex-captain of the precinct concerned here has become a city councilor and he took over there the job of some kind of political supervisor of the police's work. Since he was a mediocre cop he has reached his Peter's Principle's level of incompetence and that shows. What's more he is unfaithful with his family and violent with the prostitute he uses for his services and these are extremely necessary for him to just mentally survive because in the previous season he was orally raped by a criminal and he has not yet been able to negotiate what has to come next.

He is replaced by a woman as captain of that precinct and she wants to implement the new policy of seizure of all that is financed by drug money. She runs into various social services and political bodies because she shows how corrupt and incompetent these social services are and how hypocritical and careless these political bodies are. She uses the special unit of the precinct to reinforce the hitting power of the police department but the drug dealers will hit back and hard: two cops will die.

But the mayor and the chief of police give little damn if not no damn at all about that. They just want to put their hands on the boss of the Salvadorian drug network and they are ready to negotiate a deal with the rotten preacher who has commandeered the killing of the two cops to release him if he gives names and details. The police precinct goes just faster than the rotten information given by this rotten preacher to the just as rotten politicians and capture the Salvadorian drug lord before he even can clean up his stable.

But politics are what they are: a rotten bag of vultures and living dead or dead duds and they always manage to have the last word or the last head. They nevertheless have to yield and give the rotten preacher to the police for his arrest on the count of being responsible for the killing of the two cops but then they have the head of this female captain that is stirring their cesspool and disturbing their peaceful dealing with criminals as if they were decent citizens.

Apart from this strong denunciation of the political side and very short shortcoming of police work in Los Angeles, which is the originality of this series as compared to all other crime scene series in Miami, New York or Las Vegas and Washington DC, apart from Dexter that also deals, a little bit, with politics, this series is not really innovative. The crime dealt with in the series is gang crime essentially having to do with drugs, but also weapons and the Russian or Armenian or other post-KGB Eastern European mafias. So it is action and violence first of all.

The personal context of these cops is not original either: divorce, children to take care of with one side note on two kids that are autistic but remain totally marginalized, sentimental connection or disconnection, sexual deprivation or violent compensation, prostitution and crime money, corruption and putrefaction, and racist and sexist relations within the police itself, not to speak of racist oriented attitudes of both some blacks and some whites, to the point of slowing down or trying to block the work of the police itself.

2408320,4,B000B837Z6,"This season introduces two movie stars to play the new captain and the new ""gone clean"" gangsta phony. The series protagonist Vic Mackey takes a back seat in this season while Shane gets himself cozy with the drug dealer villain and then gets in deep and needs to get out of it.

There are plenty of twists and turns and the first four eps set up the remaining ones that revolve around a pair of cop killings that is a four ep long mystery that is in retaliation for a controversial now home / land / auto censure. Sell drugs and get caught and sold. The cops look like the bad guys, the bad guys look good.

The lines are totally greyed in this season. Watching it the first time was amazing, but the second time was not. The sub plots seem very off the beaten path, like detective Whims & Dutch struggling to get un blacklisted. Councilman Aceveda deals with post trauma stress by hiring a street walker and the officers have issues with job vs morals.

For those who have followed the Strike Team for 3 seasons, it's splintered. Suspension of disbelief is required as some elements are introduced into the season's plot. During the first few episodes, Anthony Anderson's bad guy Antwon Mitchell seems like another textbook ""drug dealer hiding behind his fake community leader"" facade. Glass Half Full Review: Glenn Close is good in her role...very, very good, and it showed no small amount of risk taking for creator Sean Ryan to ""cleanse the palate"" after Benito Martinez's Captain Aceveda's ascension to city council by introducing a strong female lead. The strength of The Shield lies in the fact that every character, from the most noble to the most evil, is flawed in some way (just like real life). Rawling is no exception. By splintering the Strike Team, Ryan has plenty of free space to peel back the layers of each character. Everyone evolves, including the Dutch-Claudette dynamic, Dutch's awkward blind date with Claudette's friend (caught on a surveillance cam and savored in the Clubhouse by Vic & friends), Dutch asking Corinne out on a date, Julian's refusal to break down the doors of a church stocked to the rafters with black tar heroin, and Aceveda's visit to...OK, that's enough teasers. The events of Season 5, particularly the Lem-Shane dynamic, pack a MUCH greater punch when you allow Season 4 to set them in motion for you. And Antwon? You'll find out that the hype surrounding this character is no hype when you hit Disc 2. Glass half empty, glass half full...a transitional season with no apologies, and still one of the best...if not THE best...shows on television.",1176508800,4,1807,4.966996699669967
2408339,2,B000B837Z6,"I am a big fan of the Shield. The first three seasons of it are some of the greatest trash television I have ever seen. The drama is gripping, the characters wonderful and the tired premise of ""cop show"" is ressurected with Frankensteinian vigor.

But Season 4 is very very bad. The first thing that goes wrong is immediately apparent in the above picture ... Glen Close. They went and got themselves a famous actress. But Glen Close is the exact opposite of what you want in a show like this. What the heck is she supposed to be? She looks like she should be selling Oil of Olay or fancy pillows in a boutique somewhere -not playing hard boiled police battleaxe. She's too much of a girlie fussbudget to be a cop, and brings about as much intensity to the role as a bland piece of white toast. I mean, Sally Struthers would be about as convincing. At least she's big and fat and looks like she could slap the cuffs on someone. Glen Close looks like she wants to cry. I know what they were thinking; she played the psycho lady in ""Fatal Attraction"" - so she can bring ""intensity"" to a cop role. Nonsense; ""psycho woman spurned"" and ""Police chief"" have nothing in common. The quality and nature of the intensity of a Police chief have nothing to do with spurned neurotic ex girlfriend acting twitchy.

All the character motivations in this season have gone haywire.

Claudette versus  DA lady: what is that? In real life they'd be all high fiving each other and calling each other ""sister,"" and figuring our how to get one over on the man, rather than being randomly nasty to each other. She was one of my favorite characters in the earlier episodes, the way she had a mom thing with nerdy serial killer boy, and how she had no life. Now she's just an uptight creep with a pose. And, all of a sudden, in season 4, Mackey is a weakling. In every other episode, he pulled out his chest hair like a character in a spanish opera, and pistol whipped whoever else thought they were in charge like some kind of street smart Nietzschean superman. I mean, he SHOT some innocent cop for no good reason in the early episodes. Now when Oil of Olay poodle lady emits a high pitched whine at him, he rolls over and promises to be a good little boy. Shane the redneck was always kind of an unsympathetic character, but he wasn't as silly as he is being. ""Oooo, I got baby now: I think I will start living really dangerously."" The surfer and computer hacker dude seem even more lost than usual because Mackey has lost his mojo. None of these things make much sense, though they seemed to have consistent and interesting characters previously.

Finally, season 4 is all preachy and social commentary. You know what? The last thing the world needs is leaden social commentary from the types of dullard who write for TV shows. ""Ooo, maybe property forfieture is bad, even if it does mean Detective Mackey can finally make use of a proper toilet bowl at work."" Or, ""golly, maybe porn is bad because it causes gang warfare."" You know what? That isn't very interesting. Character development and plot is a lot more interesting than attempts to redeem the audience. If I want to be morally saved, I'll go watch PBS or a Michael Moore ""documentary."" The cool thing about the show in seasons previous to this one was that it was amoral and wicked, like life. Life doesn't provide  General Foods International Coffee thoughtfulness on difficult social issues of the day. Life hits you in the head with a lead pipe.",1175817600,9,3487,4.500789889415482

2408342,5,B000B837Z6,"Glenn Close is one of my favorite actresses.  ""The Shield"" is my favorite show.  Why, oh why did I approach Season 4 with such fear and trepidation?  Close immediately rattled things in the Barn and presented her Monica as a tough-as-nails, no nonsense, Captain who would not allow the wool to be pulled over her eyes.  One of the best things this season was watching seen-it-all/ know-it-all Mackey develop respect for his new captain, and try - as best as he possibly could - to piece together loose ends he's left, and fight his perpetually tormenting demons.  Chiklis and Close.  On paper Chiklis and Close seem the most unlikely of duos - and yet, perhaps even because of this, become, instead, the most riveting screen partnership imaginable.

C.C.H. Pounder simply earns props for creating - and staying - one of the best damn, most straightforward, steadfast and honorable characters in any series history.  She's taken an unglamorous role that in most hands could easily have become part of the scenery (and still earned Emmy nods) and instead has given us a complex, brilliant detective that can take off the gloves and go toe-to-toe with anything and anyone.  She makes us care and she just rocks.

I mean no slight to the rest of the company: Goggins, Martinez, Karnes, Cahlin Ryan, Jace, Dent, Johnson, Snell, and company - I've merely run out of time.  I will say ALL of them, perform - nay, LIVE their roles and do so at the highest level to make this ensemble one of the most formidable casts on television. As with the premiere season, Season 4 of The Shield takes television drama to an inspired level.

If you're one of those who needs their dramas nice and neat, with squared-off camera angles and movie score soundtracks, The Shield will wake you up as to how raw, powerful and soul seering television drama can be.  While there have been other series that can stand alongside The Shield, none of them surpass it.  It's as good as it gets.",1169683200,9,1960,4.692982456140351

2408352,3,B000B837Z6,"...season 4 was it.  ""The Shield"" is my favorite show on television, ever, easily.  That said, Season 4 is by far the weakest of all the seasons aired so far.  It stands as a kind of buffer between the excellent storyline/arc of seasons 2-3, and the masterpiece that is Season 5.  That said, it still puts it miles ahead of anything else on television.",1160092800,5,352,4.453125
2408353,5,B000B837Z6,"Aside from its first season, the fourth go-round for ""The Shield"" is the most independent season: you don't necessarily have to have watched the previous seasons for it to make sense (although it certainly helps and makes for more drama when you know what's going on between all the characters and their history).

Glenn Close is a wonder as the take-charge female captain in the Barn, and I think it's very interesting how Mackey works to earn her trust as she works to earn his respect.

But the real ""womano a mano"" relationship is between Close's Capt. Rawling and Anthony Anderson in his brilliant, chilling turn as LA gang leader Antwon Mitchell. From the opening episode, where he makes a crack about having figuratively sent her former partner  -- and lover -- to the grave, it's clear that she is out to get him, at almost any price.

The political ramifications of her asset forfeiture program also add a social-commentary element to the show: is it fair to essentially repo someone's house because they can't PROVE it WASN'T bought with drug money?  Probably not. The fact that Rawling really legitimately wants it to work -- and consequently represents the best possible scenario for what is widely considered a controversial-at-best program that breeds corruption -- makes it all the more devastating when her first repo decision just obviously isn't going to turn out well.

But it's the ruthlessness of Antwon Mitchell that casts a large pall over the entire season: his ability to convince his community that he's going good and his oddly ministerial speech pattern make him all the more menacing, especially in the oft-touted ""Tarbaby"" episode, which quite honestly contains one of the most horrifying endings I've seen on cable TV. Not gory, necessarily, just shocking and frightening.

And Anthony Anderson gets to deliver the best line of any villain, EVER. I can't print it here, though.

Ultimately, Antwon's actions -- and the ramifications of his involvement with a member of the Strike Team -- set up Vic and the boys for the catastrophic developments of the fifth season.

This is the greatest show on cable TV. Period.",1159401600,,2145,4.952646239554317
2408354,5,B000B837Z6,"Often considered the worst and most disliked season in the series, season 4 is seen as the weak link in the chain. For a long time I agreed with this view point. But recently, after re-watching the season, I have been forced to change my mind.

Taking a different path than the rest of the seasons, season 4 really focuses on the rebuilding of the strike team's friendship and trust, after the controverial path that Lem decided to take in season 3. The majority of the season revolves around Shane and his newly acquainted partner, Antwon Mitchell. Shane slowly begins to go down a dark path that he can't seem to find his way out of.

This season really stands out as a showing of outstanding performances by all of the actors. This season was really Walton Goggins moment to shine as he portrays the troubled role of Shane. Glenn Close adds an incredible force to the show that was very note worthy. Kenny Johnson, Lem, and Michael Chiklis, Vic, also really have some of there best moments on the show during this season.

Season 4 is a much more slower paced season than the other seasons. This season instead tries to focus more on the characters and story development.

It's very highly recommended on my part.",1147046400,4,1216,4.589861751152074

Standouts would have to be Anthony Anderson, just watch his face when Close tells him about his son during the interrogation scene late in the season, and Glenn Close.  What she does with the character of Rawlings from her first appearance to the final moments of the season is acting of the highest order.  That final episode is one for the time capsule.

2408361,4,B000B837Z6,"Every season of The Shield has been filled with more tension, drama, and excitement than an NCAA basketball tournament, and season four is no exception.  Unlike FX's other flagship shows, Nip/Tuck and (to a lesser extent) Rescue Me, The Shield rarely stoops to sensationalism, instead relying on its own mix of humanity, humor, and gritty, you-are-there realism to tell its stories of crime, depravity, and cops on the edge.  And in spite of scattered criticism, the show was still going almost as strong as ever in this, its fourth season.  To put it bluntly, any claims that The Shield has somehow ""Gone Hollwood"" are indefensible.  Yes, the uniqueness of the show's look has been muted a bit, and more of the events and dialogue come off as somewhat contrived, but this season still contains some of the show's messiest ambiguities, deepest compromises, and most violent happenings.

Of course much was made of the show's bringing in two well-known movie actors in Glenn Close and Anthony Anderson, but they're integrated easily into the Shield's ensemble precisely because the show has always relied so heavily on its whole set of layered personalities and complicated interpersonal dynamics.  The show's stable of memorable characters-Strike Team leader Vic Mackey, Detectives Dutch Waggenbach and Claudette Wyms, beat cops Danny Sofer and Julien Lowe, and scheming ex-captain David Aceveda-are still just as important as ever; there are just a couple new cogs in the series's well-oiled machinery this time around.  Close plays greatly against type as new captain Monica Rawling, but she makes a nice anti-Aceveda: tough, determined to the point of being stubborn, and almost painfully unaware of the political consequences of her actions.  Anderson, apparently afraid of being typecast in nothing but ""fat crazy black dude"" roles for the remainder of his career, takes an even bigger leap, throwing all of his considerable bulk and highly developed glowering skills into the role of Antwon Mitchell, a vicious drug dealer posing as a remade community activist.  It's not really made apparent at first, but as the season progresses it becomes evident that Antwon is not only highly intelligent and calculating but also PURE AND UNMITIGATED EVIL, and he eventually proves to be as big a problem for the Strike Team's members as any of their nemeses from previous seasons.

Even though season four starts with the Strike Team dissolved and Vic & Co. assigned to regular detective duty in the wake of season three's whole money train unpleasantness, it doesn't take them long to find themselves embroiled in a whole new set of messes, thanks largely to Vic's old rednecky pal Shane's involvement in Antwon's drug business.  Whether working with the Strike Team or with his new Latino partner Army on Vice, Shane apparently just has a knack for getting himself into trouble.  Naturally, it's not long before Vic and the rest of his old Strike Team crew find themselves knee-deep in allegations, double-dealings, and questionable loyalties, not to mention constant threats on their lives.  And even more than before, Vic has to watch his step as the people upstairs take an active interest in him and his sketchy rep.

The political intrigue is definitely stepped up a notch on the whole here, with Aceveda continuing his Machiavellian machinations from his new seat on the city council, and Monica instituting a new set of controversial policies in his place.  The Shield has never been the most topical of shows--I remember someone on a commentary track for a season three episode remarking that Shawn Ryan tries to avoid ripped-from-the-headlines plots--but here the show delves into the controversial topic of police seizures as Monica announces a new practice of seizing the assets of drug dealers and users, not to mention cracking down on the fraternizations of gang members.  If you've read about the War on Drugs, it's no secret that aggressive seizure policies have led to abuse and corruption on a massive scale, a fact the show (to its great credit) doesn't shy away from mentioning.  Thus it's no surprise when Monica finds herself fending off both the complaints of disenchanted locals and Aceveda's dilligent efforts to undermine her when people start getting their stuff taken left and right.  Monica's troubles are indicative of a major theme running through the season, as we regularly see characters paying a heavy price for taking stands, beginning when Claudette and Dutch find themselves frozen out by the DA's office after Claudette's efforts to overturn some doubtful convictions at the end of season three, continuing when Julien feels the pull of divided loyalties as he sees the effects Captain Rawling's new policies are having on the local minority population, and culminating in the avalanche of blowback Monica faces over her actions.

As it rockets toward yet another harrowing and unpredictable conclusion, The Shield leaves its usual trail of dead bodies, but the violence that takes place never overshadows the human drama that makes the show so compelling in the first place.  At bottom, The Shield is a show about flawed people trying to do their jobs under incredibly trying circumstances, and witnessing the stresses police work puts on the characters' lives has always been as crucial to the show as its testosterone-laden action and dialogue.  What occurs in this season's (relatively) quieter moments, like the respect that gradually develops between Vic and Monica and the strained relationship between Dutch and Claudette, actually makes for some of The Shield's best viewing.  At a point when most shows are running out of ideas if they haven't already, The Shield remained on the short list of TV's best shows precisely because it doesn't neglect the human element.",1143331200,,5812,5.147558386411889

Captain Aceveda still haunted by his rape nightmare scenario is now on the city council. Dutch wagenbach is at odds with partner cluadette over her refusal to give into the D.A Over past cases. One of the strong highlights of season 4 is bringing in Anthony Anderson as

Antwon Mitchell- former gangbanger turned activist who is still in the drug trade, in a brillant performace. As well the arrival of Glen Close as the Barn's new police captain. It took a while at first to see Close in the role and beleive she had the power and credablity to pull it off but once you gave it a shot she was masterful in the role. Amazing dialouge, shocking scenes, viloence, humor all laced with sheer realism and itensity.

2408408,5,B000B837Z6,"The Shield is one of the most gripping shows on television and Season 4 is no exception!  It was so tempting just to watch all the episodes in one sitting - I don't know how I manage when I have to wait for the new episodes to air on TV!  There are plenty of other cop shows on TV but the thing that stands out to me about this show is the character development; shows like Law & Order are so episodic and really neglect to delve into the main characters, but in The Shield the characters seem more real (instead of archetypes) and the longer plot line is way more compelling than an episodic format.  Furthermore, the writers challenge social norms and might even make you question our own opinions regarding law enforcement.  This show has everyting - action, depth, and a killer plot!

The best part about Season 4 was without a doubt the introduction of Glenn Close as Captain Monica Rawlings.  Who would've known she could succesfully take on this kind of role?  A pleasant surprise!  Having Monica and Vic work together was an unexpected but really interesting story arc, and definitely my favorite part of Season 4.  Shane's misadventures in the vice unit will also keep viewers riveted.

2408409,5,B000B837Z6,"Season four is yet another amazing season for ""The Shield.""

Don't rely on the low ""average"" of stars as listed above...it's clear many of the reviewers have issues with things besides the show itself...(the letterbox thing, etc.)

From start to finish, this season was as good as any of the others, and in some ways better.

The obvious difference is Glenn Close. She brings a new vital energy into the mix, and stays away from all the cliches you'd normally expect. Don't prejudge her here.

The cast remains one of the best on TV, present or past. Chiklis has created a character for the TV Hall of Fame, and he is matched in every way by his castmates.

The season-long bad guy is played with startling menace by Anthony Anderson. As Antwon Mitchell, this actor primarily known for comedy will impress you beyond belief.

The season begins with a dissolved Strike Team, a demoted Mackey, and the new Captain (Close).

The old captain, played by Benito Martinez, is dealing with all sorts of personal demons.

The two detectives, played by Jay Karnes and CCH Pounder, deal with being in the D.A.'s doghouse. While it would be easy to go unnoticed when sharing the majority of your scenes with someone as powerful as Pounder, Karnes really has a breakthrough year here.

The two lead cops, Danny and Julien, fill in side stories that weave into the grand tapestry of the whole season.

I must single out Walton Goggins, who's Shane character dares you to take your eyes off of him. You can't. His manic desperation, cocky bravado, and the ability to make the most creative, livid, insulting lines of dialogue sound like poetry are hypnotizing. He has the ability to engender sympathy towards a character so clearly defective in so many mental processes.

The plot and dialogue are again the best in the business. The labyrinthine plot demands careful attention; I almost prefer watching with either the headphones on, or English subtitles, to catch every word.

There are incidents that refer and recall those from seasons past. Sometimes trivially, often not. If you are familiar with the previous three seasons, watch the episodes by first skipping the ""previously on The Shield"" recaps that start them off. It increases the shock value. It also increases the number of times you'll say ""No way"" to your TV screen.

This show forces you to examine your own beliefs on crime, punishment, race, religion, law enforcement, poverty, drugs, sex...

My DVD set is fine. No problems with playback. The video quality is sterling, as is the sound. One episode is 16:9, and it looks terrific.

The hour long documentary at the end is a fine way to end your viewing experience.

I understand that this upcoming year of The Shield, beginning soon I think, will be it's last. It will be missed, but gloriously so.

This show is riveting.

I was unable to stop watching it.

When one episode ended, I immediately started up the next one.

I polished the box off in two days, all while being the in-house trauma surgeon at a busy urban hospital on New Year's Eve. I'd pause the show while I went to go take care of a gunshot wound victim, then return to the show when my work was done...so on and so forth until I finished the last episode New Year's Day.

When somebody says they would rather watch a TV show than sleep, that says a lot. Now whether that says something about the show, or the individual I leave to you.",1136160000,45,3409,4.686241610738255

I went back to exhange the product for a new one and found out that ALL of the copies in the store had two copies of Disc 3 and no Disc 4. Other stores in the area had the same problem.

Take this as a warning, this problem is most likely not isolated. You may not receive a complete product. I would advise waiting if possible (I know Season 5 starts 1/10) to prevent being disapointed.

I also noticed a glitch with the playback features repeating the introduction/last episode recall where it would play it twice before starting the episode.
