8368179,2,B002EP8FBU,"We purchased this DVD for my son's 4th birthday in hopes that it would be a fun/ educational show for him to watch.  It was so bad we stopped it before the end.  We were very disappointed and would like to point out several issues with this show.

1. There was at least one very disturbing movie-clip of Satan.  The fact being presented was how a specific jungle flower was used to ward off evil spirits.  That was the last straw for us, we turned the show off.

2. There are several other instances of information presented that are inappropriate for children.  One part is talking about the idea of the 'Tree of Life' being connected to the Mayan culture.  It goes on to explain differing views of this legend in Christianity and Buddhism, and presents a long shot of Adam and Eve naked.  Another explains a legend of how the tribal people believed that at night dolphins turned into handsome men who seduced women and caused 'unexplained pregnancies.'

3. This DVD is filled with evolution talk.  While I do not necessarily think that micro-evolution is contradictory to Divine Creation, the way they speak of it is not how I want my children learning it.

4. We were expecting more animal footage, but the majority of the footage was just the camera swirling around an artificial 'palm room' at some conservatory in Britain.

5.  The 'educational' facts given were done in such a fast pace and seemed disconnected from what else was going on, that I'm not sure how kids are supposed to learn anything.  The clips jumped around so much that it was difficult to follow.  Thankfully our kids lost interest quickly.

We were not impressed and will not be buying any more of these DVDs.",1357776000,3,1685,4.619528619528619
