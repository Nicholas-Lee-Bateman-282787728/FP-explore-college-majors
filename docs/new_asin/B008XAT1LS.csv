5188666,4,B008XAT1LS,"Two decent thrillers for the price of one.  Neither film will change your life, but they serve their purpose as entertainment.",1425081600,,126,5.0
5188667,2,B008XAT1LS,"After reading the positive reviews by others, my initial reaction was are they watching the same movie?  Color of Night has its pluses but cannot recommend it unless you are seeking gratuitous graphic sex and violence.  The only reason I give it two stars is because the cast and production are quite good.  Even with that going for it, I will never view this movie again.  A very predictable script and storyline that lacks any plausibility makes this a waste of time.",1420070400,,469,4.682926829268292
5188668,3,B008XAT1LS,"I bought this Blu-Ray for Color of Night and thus, will only speak of the quality of this film. I remember the buzz about the film's nudity and can assure anyone who is looking for this movie to catch a glimpse of Bruce Willis' penis that the scene is intact as I remember it from theatrical and home video releases in the early-to-mid 1990s. Now that I have that out of my system, I can honestly say that the film still holds up as an enjoyable (although predictable) thriller. I had no desire to watch Playing God but for less than $5.00 I was able to get an enjoyable movie that brought back some old memories in only two days, thanks to this title's availability through Prime. :-)",1413417600,,685,4.359375
5188669,5,B008XAT1LS,COLOR OF NIGHT/PLAYING GOD IN MY OPINION THIS MOVIES ARE GOOD,1412899200,,61,4.636363636363637
5188670,5,B008XAT1LS,"It's not quite in the category ""It's so bad It's good"" but it's close. But I happen to enjoy those movies. I also like Scott Bakula and Bruce Willis, so this was a no-brainer. As for Playing God, I haven't seen it since 1999?!? when it came out on VHS, but I remember liking it. Color of night is the US Directors Cut and stars Bruce Willis and Jane March in a Psychological thriller. If you are squeamish about nudity, then you should probably look for something else.",1411344000,,469,4.340909090909091
5188671,2,B008XAT1LS,"Color of Night is very raw and violent.  Plot line is poor.  Do not recommend at all.
Playing God is okay.  Of the two it is the better movie.
My wife and I expected more from both movies considering they starred Bruce Willis and David Duchovny respectively.",1410048000,,258,4.446808510638298

5188673,5,B008XAT1LS,Love these movies and wish it haven't taken so long for them to get out on blu ray for us,1403049600,,89,3.5
5188674,2,B008XAT1LS,It was all so obvious from the beginning. This girl character Rose was on of the worst acting I've ever seen. This is for Color of Night,1388620800,,136,4.074074074074074
5188675,3,B008XAT1LS,Old plot with an attempt at a new twist on the end. What I did like was the chemistry between the Jane March character and Bruce Willis character. The freedom they exhibited sexually would be something I wish I could duplicate.,1381104000,,227,4.560975609756097
5188676,5,B008XAT1LS,I had been waiting an waiting for a copy of Color of Night to come out on Blu-ray and this did not disappoint. Loved it.,1379116800,,120,3.84
5188677,5,B008XAT1LS,This Blu-ray Was Really Good both movies had a lot of action and color of night was what I call a great thrill ride all the way to the end and playing god was straight action all the way threw,1379116800,,192,3.825
5188678,3,B008XAT1LS,Decent movie if nothing else is on.  I think that the movie is simply a vehicle to allow Jane March to appear in as little clothing as possible.  Or none as the case may be.,1367366400,,173,3.914285714285714
5188679,3,B008XAT1LS,"Hey, for $6.99 or less, what can you lose?  Well, $6.99 to start with and four hours of your time, but honestly it is worth $6.99 or less, nothing more.  Both movies are loaded on one side of one disc.

The Color of Night is a sexy and twist-filled noir-like who-done-it that will keep you watching.  The acting is fair at best, with the exception of Jane March who steps it up a notch.  The video transfer varies noticeably during the film but never gets unwatchable, just grainy at times like you see in the first scenes.  For most of the film though the transfer is sharp digital that never quite rises to Blu-ray perfection.  I enjoy the movie though and will probably watch it once a year or so.

Playing God?  Wow, what can I say.  On the positive side the transfer is significantly better than Color of Night.  Unfortunately the movie is so bad it is actually fun to watch......once.  The plot kind of works, but the acting, action, scene detail, and soundtrack are.....well.... laughable.  After your first viewing it is an ideal candidate for a ""Bad Flick"" party night with friends, booze, and lots of popcorn snacks you can throw at the screen.  That's when it will next appear on my big screen.",1366156800,2,1205,4.518518518518518
5188680,3,B008XAT1LS,- was an erotic thriller alwright - Jane March was lovely as expected - the twists were there but by todays standards - a bit dated!,1365465600,,132,4.115384615384615
5188681,4,B008XAT1LS,I consider Color of Night a very interesting drama mystery with a considerable amount of sexual situations. I remember when it was released that Bruce Willis strongly fought to keep male frontal nudity from being cut from the movie. He won.,1360713600,,240,4.878048780487805
5188682,5,B008XAT1LS,Only wanted Color of Night.  One of Bruce's Best Films.  He really has to act.  The supporting cast is a standout.  Really Jane March steals the movie with her dual roles.,1358899200,,171,4.419354838709677
5188685,5,B008XAT1LS,"Color of night is a great movie if your a Bruce Willis fan, was happy to see it out on blu-ray finally!",1358467200,,103,3.727272727272727
5188686,4,B008XAT1LS,"Never boring. ""Color Of Night"" is a camp classic. ""Playing God"" is well fun. Enjoyed them both. Take a chance",1357776000,,109,4.5
5188687,3,B008XAT1LS,"Unfortunately neither of these films are in 5.1, which spoils the experience somewhat. Otherwise the picture is sharp and clear, the colour depth quite nice.",1356393600,,157,5.32
5188688,4,B008XAT1LS,"I'm not a Color of Night fan but a BIG Playing God fan. I bought this on sale for $5 because my DVD copy isn't optimized for 16:9 HDTVs. The picture quality of this Blu-ray release is a definite improvement over the DVD release ... you get the full 16:9 frame (instead of a black border around it) and crisper details and better contrast. Sadly this film flew under the radar, so this may be the best transfer treatment it will get.",1355529600,,432,4.280487804878049
5188689,3,B008XAT1LS,"These are two not particular successful moves but both are interesting and original. Color of the Night is not the ""R"" version not the ""UNRATED"" one; it is something in between.  The movie has a decent but sometimes difficult to believe script  Playing God is interesting with not fully developed story; it could have been a classic but never gets deeper into characters and motivations.",1355097600,2,387,4.938461538461539
5188690,4,B008XAT1LS,"Color of Night
An ""erotic thriller"" that lives up to the adjective but not the noun. After his colleague is murdered, psychologist Bill Capa (played by Bruce Willis) helms his deceased colleague's therapy group in order to help the police find the culprit. However, when Rose (Jane March) mysteriously enters the picture, things get more convoluted. Though not as suspenseful as one would hope, the movie moves along briskly despite its long run time (139 min), thanks to good acting, some good car chases, and Jane March, who's red-hot sexy here, both in and out of her clothes.

The Blu-ray picture is on the soft side: colors are a bit muted and grain is present throughout (the latter is not necessarily a drawback: many viewers appreciate the look of natural film grain). There are also streaks and specks, inherent in the film source, but the image is generally clear and there are no distracting artifacts. Audio is English DTS-HD MA 2.0, which is clean but unexceptional.

Playing God
Entertaining action flick involving a pill-popping former surgeon (played by David Duchovny) who gets entangled in organized crime by performing rough-and-ready surgery on wounded mobsters and who gets involved with the ringleader's girlfriend (Angelina Jolie). There are well-choreographed car chases, violence in abundance, and Angelina Jolie, who looks sublime.

The Blu-ray picture is excellent. Contrast is high, colors are vivid and natural, and detail is razor-sharp. The English DTS-HD MA 2.0 is clear but unremarkable.

Conclusion
This title is a great bargain. Although there are no extras (only trailers of the films in question), you're getting two decent movies on one disc in high def, definite upgrades from the DVDs, at a price of $5 or $6. It's nice to see that Mill Creek Entertainment is releasing more double features at this price point.",1354752000,,1851,5.119205298013245
5188691,5,B008XAT1LS,"Color of Night: A very intriguing tale involving multiple personalities, a stressed out therapist, an interesting group of patients, murder and great sexual scenes.  This was one of my favorite movies when it came out, and now, in blu ray, it is even better.

Playing God: A twisted tale of arrogance gone wrong.  A doctor, hooked on himself and drugs, falls low enough to get involved with some real bad characters.  A good movie all in all.

This double feature rocks!",1353974400,6,470,4.753086419753086

5188693,4,B008XAT1LS,"I haven't watched Playing God, but I did watch, The Color of Night.  I owned the previous Directors Cut, and it appears to have the same content.  This is the extended version.  A previous reviewer stated that on cable showings, there is more to be seen.  Since, I've never seen it on cable, I cannot comment on that, but if you are looking for the previously released Director's Cut, it's here.  The video content is improved over the DVD.  It's a pretty clean print and I did not find anything wrong with the video.  It's not as pristine as a newer release, it looks more like an upconverted DVD, but I'm sure it's the best it's ever looked.  Audio was average...nothing to write home about.

For the price you really can't go wrong.  If you are on the fence, I'd say go ahead and buy.",1352160000,23,787,4.36551724137931
5188694,3,B008XAT1LS,"Video quality of Color of Night is poor. It is very grainy, which is very odd, and probably is the result of misoperation of the equipment used to convert from film to digital format. Additionally, the scene with Jane March and Bruce Willis in the pool is tamer than either of the two different versions that I've seen on cable. Although, it is the same as the Director's Cut that was released on regular DVD, and the quality is much, much better, owing mainly to the fact that that DVD release was so poorly done as to be barely watchable.",1351641600,10,540,4.41

8531837,4,B008XAT1LS,"When I worked in the video section of a department store for a couple of years back in the 90s, I remember seeing COLOR OF NIGHT on the shelves and dismissing it as a cut-rate version of BASIC INSTINCT, etc. due to the racy cover photo. Flash-forward twenty years and I picked this up at the Dollar Store of all places on a two-fer Blu-ray.

Im not quite sure what effect the producers were going for back in 1994, but two decades later COLOR OF NIGHT plays like a delicious over-the-top black comedy (a la SNAKES ON A PLANE, etc.) that features capable performances from various character actors as were used to seeing them (Scott Bakula as the studly but relatable good-guy; Lesley-Anne Warren as the loveable ditz; Brad Dourif as the quirky, twitchy red-herring). When I saw one my all-time favorite character actresses (the sadly underused) Kathleen Wilhoite fellating the end of a pistol and looking like a demented drag queen in the opening scene, I knew this was going to be a fun ride. Theres violence (but so over-the-top its hard to be disturbed); theres sex and nudity (you see the tip of Bruces willie in a pool scene); theres rattlesnakes in mailboxes and theres a twist ending (though I admit while I had it figured out within the first half-hour, it didn't dampen my enjoyment).

Not quite as lovingly bad as something like SHOWGIRLS, but COLOR OF NIGHT still entertains and is best enjoyed with a few good friends and lots of wine.
