2796637,1,B000OIOS92,"This yoga ""class"" consists of the guy doing the pose with no spoken instruction, then the camera freezing on the still picture of him in the pose for a while. I expect more. Ditto to all the ""yoga for health"" series. I tried a number of them and they all did the same thing. Not very helpful.",1388534400,,292,4.140350877192983
2796638,5,B000OIOS92,"Omg.
Spine is eased.
Pain diminishing.
Keep at this and I guarantee and stand behind the fact that you will be surprised. With your results.",1386374400,,140,4.64
2796639,1,B000OIOS92,"This video is NOT for beginners. There is no instruction whatsoever! No talking at all minus the ""om""s at the beginning which I found annoying.

I watched this video because I have lower back problems and have done yoga in the past that has helped. If that is your reasoning DO NOT WATCH OR PERFORM THIS VIDEO. The instructors (and I use that word lightly) are SUPER flexable - I'm not sure they HAVE a spine. I could only go part of the way for all the moves and there is no adaptation for people who are not gumby. My back, although slightly stretched is KILLING now and I was having a great day! NOT for people with lower back problems as they have you hold odd and semi painful positions.

EXTREEMLY unhappy with this video.",1381881600,2,728,4.345588235294118
2796640,1,B000OIOS92,"First the cover of this video and the actual video are nothing alike. The cover has a girl in exercise clothes in a nice location. The video is a guy in a polo shirt with a very distracting background. There are no words or helpful tips on the poses, just the guy doing his practice.

Other reviews have commented that the practice is good, and the instructions for the poses are in another video. I did not finish the video, so I won't comment on the quality of the practice. But, the video was useless to me. Personally I like to look at the screen only when I need clarification for the pose, not every time a new pose comes up. Perhaps this program has good benefits, but the format was so bad that I will be going elsewhere for a yoga video.",1373587200,7,746,4.216783216783217
2796641,2,B000OIOS92,"I love yoga. This video would have been better if they told you when to change positions. I was streaming it from Amazon Prime, perhaps the quality might be different it was on a DVD though. The video was strange because they would show images of the positions, not video (else I would have been able to see the performers breathing with their chests rising and falling).",1372982400,3,371,4.552238805970149
2796642,5,B000OIOS92,"Yoga Mind Body Connection TEACHES the poses. It's the first video.
The other videos in the series PRACTICE the poses.

This is a DVD set and the first video in the series is the one to start with. The first video thoroughly instructs and explains each and every position. See my review, it's just an overall fantastic starting point. But in summary the first video sets itself apart from other instructional methods as it contains that information which helps you move beyond just imitating yoga poses, to being in the correct pose having moved into the position in the correct manner and for the right reason.

The other DVDs are the practice of those positions. So if you don't first watch the ""Yoga Mind Body Connection"" video, the others will seem lame as some of the comments suggest. But this is a video of an actual session meant to address a specific area of the body. This actual session is a video of a person using the poses learned in the first video in a specific sequence with specific timings for each pose. There is a polite bell that sounds indicating transition time and then shows the transition and pose.

While the other videos in the series are just a guide and series of positions, it's the first DVD in this series that really makes it a winner. The other DVDs make it solid and follow it up such that you can easily progress from beginner to intermediate with an excellent guide that builds your knowledge of each position and your use of them in sequences.

If there's a downside it's that you don't know the whole sequence ahead of time. A short summary of some kind would be nice but it could be easily written from a single watching.

Following along a with the video is nice as it keeps you in a sequence of poses, shows transitions to each pose and with the polite bell allows you to focus on the practice and not on the video while giving just enough visual instruction to allow you to be effective quickly.

The director of this series nailed it ... just an overall excellent instructional aid that can be used multiple times.

It's clear the actors aren't just acting, but actually assuming these poses with the confidence of long practice. Excellent physical form and position are displayed throughout.",1370736000,14,2237,4.605527638190955
2796643,1,B000OIOS92,"These people are completely mute. They provide absolutely no instruction, and expect you to just look and follow along. I would be nice if they at least tell you when to change position, etc.",1367539200,4,191,4.647058823529412
2796644,5,B000OIOS92,Awesome! Word-free easy yoga with soothing background music for beginners focused on releasing tension in the back. Perfect for silent meditation.,1367107200,,146,6.0
2796645,1,B000OIOS92,"While the poses were ok, they did not flow well and there was no instruction at all.  The music was enjoyable, but that was the videos only redeeming quality.  I would return this video if it were possible to do that.",1332288000,5,217,4.2682926829268295
2796646,4,B000OIOS92,"The video looks nothing like the beautiful cover photo and it was shot in a studio. I was going to try to return the rental because the visuals aren't anything like the cover shot. However, I decided to give it a try since my back was really bothering me.  Wow!!! After the last pose I stood up from my yoga mat and I felt so much better.  The backbend and strengthening poses I think really helped.  For me it is a plus that there is no talking and the music is a lovely, soothing flute.  I will keep this and I can't wait to do the routine again today because I've felt so much better all day and want to keep it going.  Maybe the makers of the film will shoot a yoga video someday in a setting similar to the one on the cover photo!!",1324944000,4,736,4.013698630136986
8185217,1,B000OIOS92,"Very low budget and poor production values, and people with true spinal problems should never do most of the postures in this DVD - I know from over 20 years experience doing yoga with a spinal injury.  Can't believe anyone would watch this more than once.",1482969600,,256,4.565217391304348
8185218,2,B000OIOS92,"FORM: This video is simply a man and his female assistant demonstrating poses silently. They go into the poses, and then you are literally looking at stills while you hold the pose. I suppose it would work if the exercises were good for me. I've just never seen a video exercise program demonstrated this way before. The cover is unrelated to the actual content.

CONTENT: This is not ""yoga for spinal problems""; it's ""yoga poses for your back."" As in, an already healthy back. I have a lumbar compression fracture, traumatic-onset degenerative disc disease, and poor spinal strength and mobility. There's no way I could get into some of these poses, and if I could, they'd probably exacerbate my condition. When the video opened with a man in full lotus position, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be the right video for me.",1478822400,,826,4.696551724137931

8185220,4,B000OIOS92,"While not a beginner video, this DVD had some great yoga moves to release the tension in my back. Watch the demonstrator and then use your common sense to adapt it to your needs. I enjoy this line of videos because there is not any rambling instructor, so I find it easier to just relax and focus on clearing my mind.",1445990400,,317,4.213114754098361
8185221,5,B000OIOS92,"Even when in pain, I was able to do these asanas without a problem and it felt better than a massage.  I hope with continued practice that the pain will diminish.  Will report back.",1438387200,,181,4.294117647058823
8185222,5,B000OIOS92,"Reviewer B. Ogatiy nailed it, so I will just tell you to look for B's review, rather than repeat it.  I'll just add my encouragement to B's - this is one video is a SERIES.  The first video in the series (Yoga:Mind Body Connection) is about 2 hours long and teaches the asanas (postures or poses).  The rest of these short videos combine various asanas in a recommended session to address the problem that is the topic of the particular video.  There is NO instruction given, only a (wordless) demo to follow along that presumes you have already made yourself familiar with the demo'd asanas, or have that first video on hand to refer to.  And can I just say...best yoga series I've seen.",1427068800,2,688,4.516129032258065
8185223,1,B000OIOS92,"The video cover is completely misleading.  All of the poses were done in a studio back room by two totally silent practitioners.  There was absolutely no guidance on achieving proper form, or cautions for safety.  These were just presentations of a handful of asanas that I could have learned from a book!  I do not recommend this video or anything from this producer.",1416787200,3,368,4.7936507936507935

8185225,1,B000OIOS92,"I watched this video, and I can deal with no verbal instruction... but I chose this video specifically because it said it is for ""Spinal Problems"".  However, I could not do many of the poses where you have to bend backwards as I am in chronic back pain.  So I need to look for another yoga video.  Perhaps something like Yoga for chronic back pain! ;) The search continues...",1390608000,,375,4.405797101449275
8185226,1,B000OIOS92,"This video has no flow or guidance of any kind. There were no modifications if you were unable to complete the pose. It was two people, silently stretching, with soothing music.",1388966400,,177,4.741935483870968
