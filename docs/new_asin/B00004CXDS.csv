The notes on this KINO VIDEO tape describe ""The Whispering Chorus"" as being one of the more inventive films of the silent era, and DeMille's most unconvential work - mainly for the way it tackles the subject of the conflicting thoughts we have in difficult situations: the voices in our heads - the whispering chorus of reasonings which lead us to certain decisions and actions. DeMille accomplishes this quite simply yet very effectively, and right from the start we are made to feel sympathy and understanding for the man who is torn between conflicting thoughts and motives. Poor John Tremble, suffering from work dissatisfaction and a low wage, listens to the voice that tells him his boss won't notice if he pockets some of the company's profits. Next thing we know, he is on the run and wanted for murder, although innocent of this latter crime. The lives of his wife and mother are also well portrayed in such a light that we feel for all the characters involved, and can see the tragic story from various angles as it unfolds. The story is unpredictable and exciting, and the characters so real that we feel for them, especially John Tremble. To add further emotional impact, there is an excellent musical score by Rodney Sauer, and while some of the colour tinting may not be to everyone's taste, the picture quality is excellent. I found this film to be very satisfying for its psychological drama and suspense, as well as for the story's irony and overall depiction of how our thoughts, our conscience, guides us - for better or for worse.",1098489600,3,1727,4.76
