8280794,2,B0001XAKTW,"......... SHUT UP! For one thing, these are NOT SHAW BROTHERS

FILMS! Get it through you're thick heads! These are movies with

ex-Shaw Brother actors, Jimmy Wang Yu, Lily Li, Lo Leih etc....!

And as you look in the back of the DVD case, you'll notice the

words ""in Shaw tradition""! Meaning the movies fight scenes are

like Shaw Brother films, DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE SHAW BROTHER

FILMS! Any of this seeping into your brains! I thought not! Well

anyways, this is a collection of movies which were poorly

transfered from video! And as stated by other reviewers, the

picture for each of these films are horrible, but in there own

special little way! But since I've been into kung fu films for a

long time now, I can get used to the crappy picture, the lame-

a$$ english dubbing and generic DVD designs! So pretty much I'm

saying I still enjoyed these films! Well at least The Loot and

Gallant Boxer! 800 Heros (of course they spelled it wrong) and

Deadly Roulette was crappy! The picture problems for Gallant

Boxer, Deadly Roulette and 800 heros is that... well they were

unwatchable! I mean I see things better if these movie were

pitch black! There are lots of scratches, bleeps, white

stuff ... you know the usual! The Loot's picture was actually

good, BUT when the picture movies it looks jagged! Maybe

something do with speed delay!

SO, is it worth $18!?! Well maybe if you paid me the $18 dollars

and let me have the DVD! Word to the wise, DON'T BUY THIS unless

you are the ultimate, mega-hardcore, super ultra advocate of

kung fu cinema! And 800 Heros is a war movie more or less!",1116201600,13,1606,4.512195121951219
8280795,1,B0001XAKTW,"... a bootleg with very poor picture- and soundquality!
Recommendation: Don't buy this crap !
Save your money and then get the DVDs from IVL/Celestial.",1087257600,8,151,5.08
