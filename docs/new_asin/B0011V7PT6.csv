F the disc would play correctly I, and my art history husband/expert could enjoy it no end. We saw it part way and then it STUCK...WOULD NOT MOVE ANYWHERE ELSE on the disc. We received it on the 24th, watched it on the 25th, only to find out that I had to be returned by the 24th. You have a real problem when I look at the first review of this product and find EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION.",1524700800,,555,5.202247191011236
8242555,5,B0011V7PT6,"This is a wonderful segment within this distinguished series.  Three paintings are studied: Renoirs Dance at the Moulin de la Galette, van Goghs Sunflowers and Seurats Sunday on La Grande Jatte.  As always, the issues selected for discussion are those most pertinent to the work.  With the Renoir we learn about the Moulin de la Galette, its political and class clientele and the sheer joy of the image which contrasts, in some ways, with the locales historical realities.  This theme appears again with the Seurat, though a great deal of attention is devoted to the pointillist technique.  Technique is crucial for van Gogh, of course, but the most striking historical note is the fact that his work, largely unappreciated in his lifetime, now commands kings ransom prices.

I particularly like the x-ray segments in which we can trace the development of the images.  The famous monkey in the Seurat, e.g., was a later addition to the painting.  I also liked the identification of the people in the Renoir and the account of the multiple sunflower paintings by van Gogh and the multiple images of the Grande Jatte which preceded Seurats masterpiece.

These programs are unfailingly interesting, informative and entertaining.",1504569600,,1225,5.115577889447236
8242556,1,B0011V7PT6,There is a problem with the reproduction of this DVD and I can't believe they're still selling it because I notified them of the problem. Only a very short portion of the DVD will play. We exchanged the DVD and had the exact same problem. DON'T BUY THIS!,1478304000,3,254,4.3125
8242557,1,B0011V7PT6,I have the whole series and LOVE IT! But this one disc (The Impressionist) got damaged. I've tried twice to buy the single disc as replacement  but both times the new disc wouldn't load. I didn't even try returning it a second time and just threw it away! I guess I'll just have to replace the whole series which sucks!,1472774400,3,319,4.316666666666666
8242558,1,B0011V7PT6,"I just received my DVD and it does not load.
I tried it on 2 different DVD readers as well as my computer.
I am very disappointed.
I posted 1 Star because is could not post 0",1424217600,2,174,3.72972972972973
8242559,3,B0011V7PT6,"This program devoted to an important work by each of three famous artists, Renoir, Van Gogh and Seurat, meets the high expectations of the excellent documentary series, ""The Private Life of a Masterpiece,"" with several important insights on the artists and their work. Unfortunately, the Renoir segment of this DVD is defective and will not play through. It freezes at a certain point and returns to the beginning and there is no way of bypassing this recording glitch. Luckily, there is no problem with the Van Gogh and Seurat segments.",1382832000,7,537,4.977777777777778
