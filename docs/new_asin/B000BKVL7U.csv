This one is very much dated in appearance.  Lots of talking heads of historians with use of old old photos and footage of the wall as back drop.  All the same this DVD is informative but this is not one I'd like to watch over and over again and I'm a person that loves to watch good ones over and over.",1154736000,20,442,4.176470588235294
8088328,5,B000BKVL7U,"The Great Wall of China is an excellent overview of both Chinese history and its relationship to the Great Wall.  Topics covered include the origins of the Great Wall during the Warring States Period, Chinese philosophy (Taoism and Confucianism), the first emperor, the terra cotta army, the invasions of various foreigners (the Mongols, Manchus, and Japanese), the Communist Revolution of 1949, President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972, and the Great Wall and its significance in China today.  The video points out that there is not one great wall but rather many great walls built by many different people over a long period of time.  We also learn that it can be difficult to distinguish between what is fact and what is legend when it comes to stories about the Great Wall.  The transformation of the Great Wall as a symbol of suffering to a symbol of national pride is an underlying theme of the documentary.  Animated maps do a good job of showing the growth of China.  At about 50 minutes in length this video is ideal for classroom use or for anyone seeking a concise and informative video on both Chinese history and the Great Wall.  Highly recommended.",1491004800,,1170,4.791044776119403

8088334,4,B000BKVL7U,My husband and I viewed this video with our grandson.  He was interested in the content which was both informative and entertaining.  The historical facts about the wall were enhanced with information about the culture of the Chinese over the span of years when the wall was built.,1223424000,,281,4.833333333333333
8088335,5,B000BKVL7U,"This DVD revealed what the Great Wall of China was all about.  Why it was built and who used it.  Because I had never seen the Great Wall, I had some misconceptions about it, as many others do.  Get the true story in an intresting way.  Great pictures too.",1222646400,,256,4.163265306122449
8088336,5,B000BKVL7U,"The Great Wall of China is known as the longest construction project on earth, though neither its total length nor route are known.  This is because the wall is actually a series of walls, built and rebuilt over 2,000 years.  Originally the wall was built in B.C. between the various states of China, and then in 210 B.C. rebuilt to keep out the barbarians from the North.  (The original rebuilder was also responsible for the terra cotta army recently found buried near where he supposedly is buried.)

Folklore has it that most of the original workers were conscripts, prisoners, and defeated armies, and that 70% of the one million workers died (starvation, etc.) during construction.  Thus, it became known ""the longest cemetery in the world,"" and was seen by the Chinese as a symbol of oppression, rather than an item of pride.

Regardless, the wall never was successful as a defensive measure, and the Tatars under Genghis Khan in 1210 A.D. overran China and rule it for about a century until driven out.  Centuries later the Manchurians did likewise - largely let in by those sent as caretakers for the wall who had become their trading partners.

Chairman Mao ordered considerable amounts torn down as part of his repudiation of China's warlord past.  The ""good news"" is that Western visitors post-Nixon soon convinced the Chinese that the wall was something to admire, and reconstruction has again been undertaken.

Bottom Line:  ""The Great Wall of China"" provides good backround on the wall, as well as a number of photos of its current appearance as well as areas of extensive deterioration.",1214956800,4,1602,4.9182156133829
