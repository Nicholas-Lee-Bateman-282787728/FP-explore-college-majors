If you're at least an intermediate player, you can appreciate the content. If you're an Albert Cumming fan, the video introduces you to a down-to-earth guy who loves the blues and vents that mojo through his strat.",1509321600,,344,4.655737704918033
8469809,2,B005F9RFGS,"I love Albert Cummings's playing, so I eagerly anticipated the arrival of his DVD. Unfortunately, this DVD does very little to help you play like Albert. Very little tab and what tab there is is of a few simple licks you already know. Albert's obviously a nice guy with a great attitude, but leaves a lot to be desired as a guitar teacher. This DVD is almost entirely Albert giving his thoughts on pedals, playing style, gigging, etc. No tab of his cool runs. Only the most beginning player will benefit from the limited tab here, and only advanced players who like to learn without tab will benefit from watching Albert play a little on the DVD. Kind of like YouTube but for $20. Albert, you should hook up with TrueFire and do a real instructional video with accurate tab. Anyway, I'll keep buying your tunes on iTunes.",1326499200,7,821,4.554054054054054
