6388636,4,B00JPQ1II8,"I love this movie. It's pure Grade B junk & it works like crazy.  The first time I saw it I thought ""who in the heck created this piece of lunacy??!""  But it grows on you.  Despite its flaws, Ghosts of Mars is a very interesting and entertaining sci-fi film. If you are a fan of science fiction or of John Carpenter, then definitely check this out. You should have a good time if nothing else.",1430265600,,393,4.144736842105263

6388642,1,B00JPQ1II8,I feel like anyone that left a positive review was either paid or used a different one than me. The few small drain holes get clogged with seeds and won't drain. I like my 2-tiered sprouter much better,1481846400,,201,4.315789473684211

8653043,2,B00JPQ1II8,"Oh boy. I'm a huge Carpenter fan, but this movie is terrible. I'm not sure if Carpenter was working with a very small budget and/or was checked out, but you'd be better to skip this movie.",1515110400,,188,4.25
8653044,3,B00JPQ1II8,"Mars has unwelcomed visitors set on terraforming the planet to suit themselves.  The job is almost done when Dr. Arlene Whitlock (Joanna Cassidy) opens an entryway that shouldnt have been disturbed, releasing a red mist of disembodied spirits intent on regaining their planet through possession.
Lieutenant Ballard (Natasha Henstridge) is in charge of a doomed mission to transport a difficult prisoner (Ice Cube as Desolation Williams) to stand trial.  The only thing between them and the perfect escape is a band of murderous lunatics.

The plot is disjointed, told from the point of view of several characters.  The story backtracks several times before heading off in various directions.  They wasted twenty-eight million on this film, though goodness knows where!  They reaped little reward at the box officea measly fourteen million.  This was intended to be another Snake Plissken movie, Escape from Mars.  This movie supposedly killed John Carpenters career.

And now you know what to do with red food dye.  Add it to white gypsum and call it Mars.",1509667200,,1056,5.195266272189349
8653045,2,B00JPQ1II8,"This review and rating is for the 2014 Mill Creek Entertainment DVD release.

The film is presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.40:1 (according to the DVD case). The only audio track is ""English Dolby Digital 2.0"" There are no available subtitles. I didn't notice any problems with the picture or sound while watching.

This kind of bare-bones release is almost unheard of these days. If you only want the movie for a cheap price, and you don't care abut the 2.0 audio or lack of subtitles, this will suit your needs. If you like your DVDs with all the features that are usually standard (multiple audio options, subtitles), and some special features, you have to track down one of the earlier releases.",1506556800,,715,4.712
8653046,3,B00JPQ1II8,"a bit hoaky and long winded.  but, makes for an inexpensive night's entertainment.",1499299200,,82,5.3076923076923075
8653047,5,B00JPQ1II8,As advertised.,1497744000,,14,6.5
8653048,5,B00JPQ1II8,"Ghost Of Mars is a Carpenter Cult Hit. The action is great. The actors are great. Ice Cube one of his better roles. Pam Grier nice part. Lots of great actors in there. It feels like a real old school Carpenter film with the atmosphere and suspense. When released in 2001 they called it a bomb but here we are in 2017 and the reviews have changed and the film continues to have life and grow more and more legs with each new generation.

  Perhaps we were too quick to call John Carpenter washed up and done as his movies age well. The mark of a great director. Cheers and Enjoy!",1492473600,,578,4.1891891891891895
8653049,5,B00JPQ1II8,One of my favorite movies.  Thank you!,1492300800,,38,4.428571428571429
