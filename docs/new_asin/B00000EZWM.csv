7906248,5,B00000EZWM,"I absolutely adore these Colegate Comedy Hours dvds ( hilarious comedy action) unfortunately the contents can be duplicated on other Colegate dvds, As a lover of Lewis and Martin it means I have spares if needed. Fabulous entertainment especially when they fluff their lines or sketches go awry, if a dvd of their bloopers could be made I'm sure sales would rocket GREAT STUFF !!",1408838400,,379,4.846153846153846
7906249,3,B00000EZWM,"I purchased this seven episode set to compliment some other Colgate Comedy Hour episodes I have which feature other hosts (Abbott and Costello, Gordon MacRae).  Although I thought the concepts behind the comedy skits were brilliant, the silliness often went too far (bordering on extreme slap stick), almost to the point of stupidity, because of the antics of Jerry Lewis.  Lewis, although quite a clown and, in some cases, an excellent actor, was too mantic most of the time.  Dean Martin was the casual friend who tried to balance Jerry's wild antics, but it just didn't work.  I had hoped that the special guest stars would make each episode more enjoyable, but most did not get much time to perform and all of the special guests, except for a choral group that performed with incredible harmony, were mediocre.  Dean Martin, of course, sang a song in each of the seven episodes, but he was not terrific either; he certainly was capable of better singing.  Some folks may enjoy this almost slap-stick style comedy, but it didn't really satisfy my tastes.  Tape quality was good; all episodes are in black-and-white because they are from the 1950s.",1374278400,,1150,4.866666666666666
7906250,4,B00000EZWM,"Colgate Comedy Hour: Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis Show (7-tape boxed set) [VHS]
I enjoyed the shows. The quality was good for shows of this age.",1353974400,,141,4.461538461538462
7906251,2,B00000EZWM,"I was never a fan of Jerry Lewis and after watching all 7 tapes I know why--don't like his type of humor, he seemed to be in every scene and he upstaged Dean whenever he was on.  On one of the shows Lewis hurt Martin by stretching his mouth (Lewis got carried away with himself as he seems to do on all of these shows).  The only stars I'd heard of before on the tapes were Rosemary Clooney, Bob Fosse, Polly Bergen and a walk on by Jack Benny. They were not in any of the skits. They performed a couple numbers and disappeared. Couldn't figure out why Jack Benny bothered to show up, he didn't say anything. Maybe back in the day it was a privilege just to get him on a show.

By the end of the 7th tape of more of the same I'd had enough. I don't know why it took Dean Martin so long to leave Jerry Lewis. Thank heavens Sinatra took Martin under his wing.  He gave Martin confidence and respect and Martin showed us how talented he really was. On the Martin & Lewis Colgate Comedy Hour I saw a very vulnerable Dean who had more to give if he had been given the chance.

Pros: Filmed before a live audience which gives the comedy hour a sense of electricity; the last 5 minutes of each program where Lewis & Martin are tired. They seem to finally warm up to the audience and each other.",1235001600,,1287,4.091269841269841
7906252,5,B00000EZWM,"These videos are well worth the price for all the enjoyment they have brought. Altho it's been years since we have seen these two guys together, they still have that ""certain something"" when it comes to timing  and how to get everyone to crack up.  If you are looking for a lot of  ""nostalgic"" silliness and laughter, you have to include these  videos in your library.",943315200,3,368,4.53030303030303
7906253,5,B00000EZWM,"This boxed set is really worth watching. It will make you laugh uncontrollably,at least that's the effect it had on me. Just knowing Jerry Lewis is coming on stage is enough to start the laughter. The segments at  the end where they sing with the band are my favorites.",937526400,3,269,4.489795918367347
7906254,5,B00000EZWM,"Here's a great look at Martin and Lewis unrestrained by movie scripts and endless takes. This is live tv and amazing stuff, even 50 years after it was made. Lewis is manic, scarey, mean, vicious and hilarious. Martin is  himself - laid back, funny and with that beautiful voice. The lowlight is  seeing Jerry's Dad sing. What a ham and it's a great laugh to hear Martin  intro him and say he's on not because he's Jerry's Dad, but b/c he's a  talented singer in his own right -- yea...right! Anyway, each show ends  with a great short version of what I can only imagine was the insantiy of  their stage show. Brilliant, but seven hours is toooo short.",931824000,5,651,4.428571428571429
