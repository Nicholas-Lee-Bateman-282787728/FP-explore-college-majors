2397275,5,B000AYELME,"When Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling came into existence just under 6 years ago, it came into the world with the goal to finally give the WWE something that it had not had since WCW went out of business: competition in the world of wrestling.  Over the course of the years TNA has done things to innovate and revolutionize the business such as:

Being the first company in the history of wrestling to use a six-sided ring (and adapt it to become a six-sided steel cage), the first company to hold an ENTIRE pay-per-view inside of same cage (TNA LockDown), the first to ever do a King of the Mountain match, the list goes on and on.

However, within the company there is one group of superstars that many TNA fans would consider the crown jewel of TNA Wrestling and they are the superstars of the X Division, which would be referred to in the WWE as Cruiserweights.  However, there is one major difference between WWE's Cruiserweights and TNA's X Division stars: where the WWE stars seem limited to doing things in the ring, the X Division stars can break out with amazing and stunning moments at ANY time in the match.

The Best of the X Division, Volume 1 showcases the skills of many of the stars that symbolize the X Division, including the ""Phenomenal One"" AJ Styles, who holds several accomplishments in his run in TNA, including being the only person to pull off the Triple Crown in TNA twice. Just to clue you in, the Triple Crown in TNA is to have been the NWA Heavyweight Champion (now the TNA World Championship due to TNA separation from the NWA in 2007), NWA Tag Team Champion (TNA Tag Team Championship) and X Division Champion at least once in their career.  Styles has won the NWA/TNA Heavyweight champ twice, NWA/TNA Tag Team champ 4 times and the X Division a record-setting 6 times.

The 2 DVD set shows several matches over the last few years that are showcases of the X Division, including a 20-Man Gauntlet match for the Super X Cup from 2004, a 4-Man Xscape steel cage match from TNA LockDown where the first 2 men have to be pinned or submit to be eliminated, then the final two literally have to escape the cage by climbing out.

But 2 matches showcase the pinnacle of matches in the X Division, known simply as Ultimate X.  In Ultimate X, four steel pillars are placed at what would normally be the default corners of the ring if it were a regular ring.  Then 2 steel cables are arranged above the ring to form a giant X, with the X Division championship belt in the center of the X.  The goal is to climb up any pillar, traverse the cable and pull down the belt to ultimately win the match and the title.

Match 1 is a triple threat match between Petey Williams, Chris Sabin and AJ Styles from TNA Final Resolution 2005.  Petey Williams, who is a member of the faction in TNA known as Team Canada, possesses the sickest finisher seen either in TNA or in any federation, a flip piledriver known as the Canadian Destroyer. To see him pull it off would make you think it is impossible for someone to be able to pull it off.  The second Match is the first ever Ultimate X Challenge featuring the ""Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Ron ""The Truth"" Killings, and Styles.  Imagine 3 matches (Tag Team, Triple Threat, and Ultimate X 1 on 1) in one giant match in and of itself.  The match starts as a tag team match, then when one member of the tag team is pinned the match then turns immediately into a triple threat match, then when another wrestler is eliminated the match becomes a 1 on 1 match with Ultimate X rules.

If you want to see what the WWE can't do or seemingly won't do, check out TNA: The Best of the X Division Volume 1.  And you can only imagine what Vol 2 is going to be like...",1129420800,3,3736,4.397677793904209
2397276,5,B000AYELME,"unlike some people giving there reviews i have watch TNA from day one,it is a superior brand to WWE.the x-division is what wrestling should be.guys giving there heart every week.tna has guys like rhino,jeff jarrett,jeff hardy,raven and many more.

this dvd is a small showcase of what TNA is.

P.S WWE SUCKS.",1126656000,3,308,4.903846153846154
2397277,5,B000AYELME,"TNA is the best thing going in pro wrestling today! They have something to prove and I think that in the next few years they will be major competition for WWE. I know that WWE can play the game(if they'd get some writers who actually know wrestling) and it'll be interesting to see how far TNA will go to become the top wrestling promotion. If you have any doubts, watch this dvd or if you can, watch Turning Point '04. The Triple X vs. AMW cage match is the best match in the past few years anywhere!! And to the guy who doesn't even have the gonads to put his name on the bad TNA reviews, I'm sure WWE would hire you as a writer.

P.S. If TNA ever has a diva search, I will quite watching American wrestling.",1126656000,9,710,4.107913669064748
2397278,5,B000AYELME,"It cracks me up when people get on here and review TNA material, compairing it to the WWE. The same WWE that is refusing to allow the Dudleys to use there names and have horrible writing and never has any decent wrestling. TNA is the answer to the prayers to everyone who wishs for a better product. Check out this company. Awesome, just awesome.",1126483200,9,346,4.421875
2397279,5,B000AYELME,"O,k

So incase your new to TNA maybe you want to know why it is unique. Answer: The X division.

The x division is no limits high flying AND technicly sound athletes. No wieght limits( Amazing red- 175 pound, Samoa Joe- 285) Its all about skill.

And in this DVD you will see some of the greatest matches in TNA history, including several 4 star matches  one or two 5 star matches and some very good ones. Not a bad match on this dvd.  Trust me, its a great buy.

And to the kid reviewer: Obviously you have never seen TNA because wwe is much more of a ''porno fed'' than TNA.",1125792000,,576,4.098214285714286
2397280,4,B000AYELME,"If you love high flying, no limits wrestling action, the TNA x division is the way to go. Many amazing superstars like AJ Styles, Christopher Daniels, Sean Waltman, Sonjay Dutt, Shocker, Michael ""Matt Bentley"" Shane, and Chris Sabin i believe are featured on this great dvd, so check it out!",1125619200,4,291,4.84
2397281,1,B000AYELME,"OK lets get this strait  STEVEN ""STEVO""  TNA is not all that, and even if it was, the WWE would buy it like they did WCW, and ECW. They will hire ur preshious AJ Styles, and then put him in the IC divishion, and he will suck. WWE has been going for over 25 years, and isn't gonna fall to a joke like TNA.",1140220800,,304,3.734375
2397282,5,B000AYELME,"First off, I must say that this is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the best wrestling DVD I've ever purchased that wasn't published by WWE, and, as most will agree, it's better than 90 percent of them(of course I don't have to tell anyone who actually bought ""He Buries Them Alive"" that). Not to quote the obvious, but Styles is simply anazing, and his matches are no exception. But as you'll read below, and, enevitably, above, many people think that TNA is better than WWE, that its wrestlers are superoir, and that it could overthrow Vince McMahon's promotion easily with the right exposure. While everyone is of course entitled to their opinion, I MUST take the risk of getting whipped to death with wet Team Canada jerseys by angry marks everywhere to voice my opinion and disagree. I'm going to try to compare the two companies, and no, there won't be much reviewing when it comes to this amazing DVD on my part, so I won't feel at all bad if you say that my review wasn't helpful.

Obviously, TNA has spectacular athletes in its X Division, guys who can either get on the mat and wrestle, or get in the air and fly. But the sad truth is that in professional wrestling,in-ring ability is only part of what it takes to be a great. As Ric Flair once said ""the key guys in this sport are the ones who can talk and wrestle"". A prime example of this is JBL. Let's face it: nobody mentions JBL and Rey Mysterio in the same breath when it comes to actual wrestling technique. But while he's not a technical genius, he is fairly competent in the ring. Bradshaw's saving grace is without a doubt his microphone skills. And while you think it's hard enough watching him on Smackdown! every week as he is, imagine Bradshaw if he had the poor mic skills of, say, A.J. Styles(ouch! I can feel the stinging of a jersey already!). Of course I know that Styles is fifty times the athlete JBL will ever be; none doubt that. But while JBL can't exactly run a one-minute mile, A.J. Styles isn't exactly a millionare on Wallstreet.

  Many will argue that TNA is better because of the educated assumption that since all WWE's wrestlers seem to be going there, it must be the better federation. Sorry, but despite the wrestlers' respective cries of WWE being lame in most promos, with the exception of Christian and A.J. Styles, most of the WWE alumni you see in TNA were fired by WWE, and in most cases, against their respective wills. Christian was a rising star in WWE who respectfully left because he was tired of waiting for a main-event push; this is in stark conrast to Billy Gunn, who was booted out of WWE while in rehab. Yes Styles left WWE in his early career, but not for TNA. His reason was that he wasn't getting paid enough to help his wife pay for college.

My final comparison is this: many TNA advocates praise TNA for being unafraid to push the envelope and provide over-the-top matches every week. Hello? What company that was ever successful DIDN'T bring something new to the table in the way of matches? Which brings me back to my earlier point: since most TNA wrestlers are never interviewed, they never can practice their career-prolonging rants (there's a reason Ric Flair is the only 56 year old wrestler you've seen lately). Once the shock of the Canadian Destroyer loses its, well, shock, what will Petey Williams have to fall back on? Are Eddie Guerrero, Steve Austin, and The Rock remembered only for their finishing moves? Uh-uh. We of course remember them for the historical and wonderfull events they were apart of inside the ring and out.

Well, that's it. Don't get me wrong, TNA could be the next ECW. But right now, though, it's in its infant stage. With a loyal fanbase, superb wrestling, and solid announcing, all of which are subliminally showcased on this DVD, TNA can, and most-likely will, go far.",1138406400,3,3822,4.5641399416909625
2397283,4,B000AYELME,"If your like me & was a fan of the crusierweight style action that you saw back in the mid to late 90's in WCW and quite frankly are disappointed in WWE's pathetic attempts at that same division (Jacqueline, Chavo Classic, Funaki...and everyone else stuck on Velocity) then this DVD is for you because this is a throwback to that style of wrestling with a little twist...there is no weight limits here which makes room for a guy like Samoa Joe to leave people with their jaws dropped.

There are some flaws here as there isn't a AJ Styles vs. Johnny Devine match which they advertised on the cover.  Also, there is also only 1 match with Styles vs. Williams vs. Sabin & that's the Ultimate X match...there isn't another 3 way dance between the three.  However all the matches on here are from the latest stint of TNA where they have the six-sided ring & are in Universal Studios in Flordia.  If your looking for X Division during the time in Nashville, check out TNA's website for the two DVD's they have in that era.

1. Victory Road - 20 Man Gauntlet Battle Royal
The format is similar to the Royal Rumble except only 20 guys & short time interluded.  You'll see old favorites like Spanky, Psychosis, La Parka, Hector Garza along with TNA regulars like Matt Bently (with Traci), Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt and others.  Fun match.

2. Victory Road - X Division Champion Petey Williams vs. AJ Styles
Unfortunally, this is one of the flops of the DVD because this match was really short (about 10 mins.) and it's constant interfearence from William's manager Scott D.  It would have been better to put the match from the Turning Point PPV with Williams vs. Sabin.

3. Impact - Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin
Nice overall match but it's clipped.

4. Final Resolution - Ultimate X Match: Williams vs. Sabin vs. Styles
If you never seen an Ultimate X match, it's really something to watch because high spots put off in this match are really something that will keep your guys on the ring.  Watch AJ get kicked off the top & flipped inside out.  The ending was something I didn't expect but it creative.  Great match.

5. Against All Odds - Ironman Match: Daniels vs. Styles
This match specifically is for those who say the X Division & TNA in general is full of ""car crash matches & high spots"" as they give you their high flyin' along with great mat wrestling for a full 30 mins.

6. Destination X - Ultimate X Match: Daniels vs. Styles vs. Primetime vs. Killings
The rules for this match was different than usual as you have to eliminate two participants in first a tag then triple threat match before the Ultimate X match actually starts.  Long match but with the stiputlations, it never really gets boring.  Teh ending was a real screwjob but what would you expect from the lead heel in the X Division at that time

7. Lockdown - Ultimate Xscape Match: Shocker vs. Matt Bentley (with Trinity) vs. Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt
Similar to the previous match, you gotta elimate two other participants before the actual match starts.  To win, you gotta be the first to escape the cage.  It was a photo finish in the end & overall a great match but the real show stealer was Trinity's moonsault from the top of the cage.

8. No Surrender - AJ Styles vs. Sean Waltman with Jerry Lynn as the guest referee
It was a average match for me but the best Waltman has looked in years.

9. No Surrender - Samoa Joe vs. Chris Sabin
Unfortunally the only Joe match on here but perfectly shows that X Divsion is about no limits, not weight limits.  Joe's style is similar to that of the ""shootfighting"" that Taz & Ken Shamrock used to do with the stiff kicks & punches.  Great match to showcase Joe.
Note: Also available on the Samoa Joe DVD

10. Interview with Jerry Lynn
Just a basic interview with Lynn talking about the beginnings of his career, how he got into the business, his favorite fueds, ect.

Bonus
In the bonus section, they have two matches from Impact featuring Triple H (Daniels & Primetime) vs. Amazing Red & Sonjay Dutt and also a six way match with AJ Styles vs. Kid Kash vs. Amazing Red vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelly vs. Kazarian.  Both of which are clipped & nothing really special.

Again, if your a fan of the old school crusierweight division of WCW...this is definately for you.",1138406400,12,4290,4.499354838709677
2397284,5,B000AYELME,"This is the kind of wrestling the world has been crying out for. Not just the x-division, but TNA in general. People you don't get any better than this. I don't know why TNA doesn't just put a two hour show on monday nights, take wrestling back, and give WWE the finger. Not only for brainwashing people into thinking that what they're selling is actually good, but also for that guy with negative zero talent that ""beat"" Kurt Angle(yeah right)...I can't remember his name...it's not important. Anyway, this dvd is serious, so buy it. Later.",1135987200,,541,4.705263157894737
2397287,5,B000AYELME,"The Best of the X-Division really is a treat to see, guys like Christopher Daniels, Chris Sabin, AJ Styles, Matt Bently, Petey Williams, Sonjay Dutt, and Samoa Joe make this division really exciting and show what high flying action really is with this great DVD set:

Victory Road Gauntlet:

Nice way to show the match, twenty men come out between one minute intervals and fight to throw all their opponents over the top rope onto the floor. Highlights include a tower of doom involving 6 or 7 guys, and great crowd interaction. Hectar Garza wins after pinning Kazarian. [The last two men had to pin each other to win.] 9/10

X-Divsion Championship

Petey Williams [Champion] vs. AJ Styles:

Sort of weird to see them fight one year later with the tide turned so that AJ is now champ. This was a great fast paced match. The Canadian Destroyer vs. The Styles Clash. Scott D'Amore interferes and allows Williams to hit the cool looking flip piledriver for the win. 8.5/10 [Should have been given a little more time]

X-Division Championship

Ultimate X Match

Petey Williams [Champion] vs. Chris Sabin vs. AJ Styles:

One of the best top three matches in this entire collection. 20 minutes of all three men using high flying moves and death defying manuevers. Cool part when Sabin kicks AJ while AJ was hanging on the cord above and Styles gets flipped over in mid air and lands with impact! Both Sabin and Williams were holding the belt when AJ jumps off the ropes and grabs the belt from their hands to get the win. 10/10

X-Division Championship

30 Minute Iron Man Match

Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles [Champion]:

Great technical battle, both men work so well together. The action was a wrestling clinic and the first pin went to Daniels after 10 minutes went by. Styles then gets a pin and so did Daniels again as the time went by. Then at the last second AJ ties the score and doesn't submit as Daniels desperately tries to make him tap out. The match then goes to sudden death and AJ gets the pin. 10/10

Six Sides of Steel X-Scape Match

Chris Sabin vs. Shocker vs. Matt Bently vs. Sonjay Dutt:

Pretty unique match. The first two men who were pinned were eliminated, then the last two would have to escape the cage. The match was fast paced and all guys took punishment with the cage. Trinity [who accompained Bently to the ring] climbs the cage and moonsaults off the top onto all the men! Sonjay is the first to go, then Bently. Shocker and Sabin fight to escape the cage and Shocker's feet hit the ground first. 8.5/10

X-Division Championship

Ultimate X Match

AJ Stlyes [Champion] vs. Elix Skipper vs. Ron Killings vs. Christopher Daniels:

Another unique match as the first two matches were a tag team match and then a triple threat match after one of the men was pinned. The last two men standing would climb to grab the belt. Killings is the first to go thanks to Skipper, then Daniels climbs to the top of the X and moonsaults onto both other men!

Skipper is the next to go after Daniels turns on him and rolls him up for the pin. After that both Aj and Daniels fight with some high flying moves as they grab at the belt. The ref is knocked down and AJ pulls down the belt. But Daniels hits the Angel's wings and steals the win! 9/10 [Smart ending]

Chris Sabin vs. Samoa Joe:

Strength and power meets speed and agility as Samoa Joe used big man moves against the speedy Sabin. Highlights include Sabin using drop kicks onto Joe on the outside and Joe hits the railing with impact! Sabin repeatedly tries to hit the Cradle shock but Samoa Joe powers out and hits an incredibly painful looking musclebuster onto Sabin and puts him in a submission move and Sabin passes out. 9.5/10

There are more matches, but these are the best ones in my opinion. The other matches are:

AJ Styles vs. Sean Waltman [Special ref. Jerry Lynn]

Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin

and a three way match between AJ, Sabin, and Williams.

A great DVD, buy this one if you really want an A+ DVD",1132272000,2,3997,4.52924791086351
2397288,4,B000AYELME,"This is a 2 disc set of matches featuring TNA's X Division. The disc is hosted by Jeremy Borash with match play-by-play by Don West and Mike Tenay. The following are my reviews of the matches based out of 5 *****:

Disc One:

1) 20 Man X Gauntlet - This is TNA's version of a Royal Rumble. There are 20 wrestlers, and they enter the ring in 60 second intervals. Wrestlers are eliminated by being tossed over the top rope onto the outside floor. The final two wrestlers have to win by either pinfall or submission. The first two wrestlers in the ring are Frankie Kazarian and Sonjay Dutt. Some notable wrestlers in this match are Chris Sabin, Hector Garza, Matt Bentley and Sonny Siaki. There is a pretty cool ""Tower Of Doom"" done by about 8 wrestlers! There are some great individual moves by various other wrestlers. The ending is lame.

Rating - *** (26min 30sec)

2) Petey Williams(C) w/ Coach D'Amore vs AJ Styles - There is a nice display of chain wrestling in the beginning of the match. AJ lands one of the most beautiful over the top rope flip-dives you will ever see. Interference from D'Amore interupts a fantastic match. Which wrestler is able to land thier finisher first? A decent match but way too short. Rating - **** (10min)

3)  Chris Sabin vs Christopher Daniels - This match is clipped as it was shown live on Impact! TV. The audience is WAY into the match and this helps bring an already great match to the next level! The beginning has some fine chain and counter move wrestling between the two. The Fallen Angle lands an incredible ""Death Valley Driver"" onto Sabin! A great match but needed to be longer, or shown completely. Rating - **** (10min)

4) Petey Williams(C) w/ Coach D'Amore vs AJ Styles vs Chris Sabin - A 3-Way Ultimate X Match. The first person to pull down the X-Champion Belt that is suspended above the ring becomes the X Division Champion. D'Amore interfered in the beginning of the bout, but he gets tossed from the ringside by the referee. This is a frickin' GREAT match! Three of the best wrestlers in the world put on a true clinic! The crowd is bonkers over this match, and chants of ""Holy Sh*t!"" and ""This is awesome!"" fill the arena! You'll be chanting the same thing after seeing this one! Petey lands an incredible ""Canadian Destroyer"" on AJ! You also have to see the hurricanrata Petey does! Awesome! The ending is lame, but it doesn't ruin the fantastic performance these three men put on. Rating - ***** (20min)

5) AJ Styles(C) vs Christopher Daniels - 30 Minute Iron Man Match. The wrestler that gets the most pins or submissions on the other in 30 minutes wins and is the X Division Champion. This is the first meeting between these two and they put on one of the best (if not THE best) Iron Man Match ever! There is some superb chain, mat, counter-move wrestling in the beginning. The action does not subside for a second. AJ bleeds a river and The Fallen Angel revels in AJ's blood! The best match on the disc! Words can not do justice to the greatness of the performance of these two wrestlers. Watch this and become a TNA fan for life (or a AJ/Daniels fan for life)! Fantastic!

Rating - ***** (33min. That's right, 33 minutes. Just WATCH IT ALREADY!)

Disc Two:

1) AJ Styles(C) vs Primetime vs Christopher Daniels vs Ron Killings - Ultimate X (Endurance) Match. The match begins as a tag-team match with AJ and Killings vs Daniels and Primetime. The first person pinned is eliminated and the match then becomes a Triple Threat Match. After the next wrestler is pinned, the match becomes a Ultimate X Match between the final two for the X Division Championship. This is another GREAT match! Primetime lands an incredible ""Sudden Death"" power-slam on Killings. The Fallen Angel does an awe inspiring Moonsault! Best Moonsault Ever baby! The ending is lame but the match as a whole is tremendous! F'n great! Rating - ***** (25min 30sec)

2) Chris Sabin vs Matt Bentley w/ Trinity vs Sonjay Dutt vs The Shocker - Iron Cage Xscape Match. The match begins as a 4-way tag match until two men are pinned. The match then has to be won between the final two by being the first to climb over the cage and reach the outside floor. There is some terrific group wrestling and spots. Trinity does the craziest moonsault you will EVER see! Trinity's spot makes this match!

Rating - **** (16min)

Pre-match interview with Jerry Lynn done by Shane Douglas.  Jerry is the special referee for the following match:

3) AJ Styles vs Sean Waltman (better known as XPac in the WWE) -

This is another superb, excellent match! Sean is a tremendous performer and his in-ring psychology is fantastic! AJ gets his nose and mouth busted open big time by Sean when Sean does a top-rope back flip to the outside of the ring onto AJ! This is a classic! Sean gets the crowd stirred into a frenzy! Great! Rating  - ***** (15min)

4) Chris Sabin vs Samoa Joe - This is a pretty decent match. Samoa Joe is the Samoan Submission Machine and there is good reason for it! He is frickin' incredible! Sabin fights his heart out! Rating - **** (14min)

There is then a 20 minute ""shoot"" interview with Jerry Lynn as he talks about his career and other wrestlers and organizations. A nice addition and informative interview.

Bonus Matches:

1) Amazing Red vs Chris Sabin vs Kid Kash vs Alex Shelley vs Frankie Kazarian vs AJ Styles - 6-Way Impact! Match to be the #1 X Division Contender. This match is clipped as it was shown on Impact TV. An OK match. Nothing special. Rating  - *** (6min)

2) Triple X (Christopher Daniels & Primetime) vs Amazing Red & Sonjay Dutt. Impact! Tag Team Match. This is clipped as it was shown on Impact! TV. Nothing special about this one either. Rating - **1/2 (6min)

Beware! The back of this disc says that there is a match between AJ Styles and Johnny Devine, as well as a SECOND 3-Way Ultimate X Match between AJ,Sabin and Petey Williams, BUT these ARE NOT on the disc! At least I could not locate them on the disc. What's up with that? Come on TNA. If you want to gain more fans and a bigger audience, you have to be MUCH better with your editing and quality control! There is NO reason to have a such a blatent F-Up! Also, the disc packaging is very cheap. The plastic disc holders break easily and there is no inside booklet or table of contents. I expect MUCH better as far as qualtiy and editing is concerned with any future DVDs.

Overall, the matches on the disc are great. You WILL become a fan of TNA after seeing this! Beware WWE!",1130630400,5,6498,4.499575191163976

2397291,4,B000AYELME,"The X Division is an incredible division in TNA, much like the Cruiserweight division from WCW, not the WWE. It showcases what is considered some of the greatest wrestling of all time, and with the matches from this DVD, I can't argue

Victory Road - 20 Man X Division Gauntlet - Terrific match from TNA's first 3-hour PPV, with all the men in the ring it can get hard to focus sometimes, but that's the only complaint. Terrific performances from Jerrelle Clark and Kazarian, and an awesome tower of doom. 8/10

Victory Road - AJ Styles vs. Petey Williams for the X Division Championship - Once again from TNA's first PPV, this match was probably the most hyped TNA match ever at the time, and it did not disappoint, first time viewers will see how awesome AJ's offense is only complaint is that it was a little short, and Scott D'Amore played too big of a role, great match 7/10

Impact! - Chris Sabin vs. Christopher Daniels for a spot in the Ultimate X Match - Not one of my favorite matches of all time, I remember it being better, this was probably the start of Daniels' singles push, great for an Impact main event, but that about covers it 6/10

Final Resolution - Ultimate X Match for the X Division Championship - One of the greatest X division matches of all time, each man sells their injuries and fatigue fantastically, awesome hurricanrana from Petey and a sick bump from the top of the X by AJ Styles that has to be seen to believed, great ending 10/10

Against All Odds - Christopher Daniels vs. AJ Styles in an Ironman Match for the X Division Championship - Possibly the greatest Ironman match I have ever seen, these two just have that rare chemistry, always have, AJ does a splendid job of selling the fatigue while Daniels plays that arrogant a-hole so well, not a bad thing wrong with this match 10/10

Destination X - Ultimate X Match for the X Division Championship - Awesome, but not as good as Final Resolution, I think it has to do with the X not really being a huge factor (other than an awesome moonsault and a reverse hurricanrana spot) until the final two, the tag team and triple threat stipulations worked fairly well, but were kind of throwaway because everyone and their brother knew the final two were going to be Daniels and Styles, like I said awesome, but not as good as Final Resolution 9/10

Lockdown - Xscape Match - Great tag team match that turns into a sloppy triple threat match and a mediocre cage match. When Dutt was eliminated first I knew we were in trouble however Sabin and Bentley did offer a few cool spots, that whiplash into the cage just looked plain brutal. Shocker never did it for me as a wrestler, so I wasn't real happy with the ending. Trinity's moonsault has to be one of the best woman spots I've ever seen. Good tag team match, but that's about it. 6/10

No Surrender - AJ Styles vs. Sean Waltman - A good match with great ring psychology and having Jerry Lynn as referee only made the whole experience sweeter. Typical good spots by AJ and Waltman also brought his A game. AJ's first Clash looked sick and I'm surprised that Waltman didn't have a neck injury afterwards. AJ's bloody nose is pretty sick, but the show must go on. A damn good match 7/10

No Surrender - Samoa Joe vs. Chris Sabin - The first time I ever had a chance to see Joe in action, and I have to say he impressed. Sabin did a terrific job of withstanding Joe's brutal offense. That Muscle Buster was just awesome, and so was the Kokhia Clutch. Sabin looked stronger after taking Joe's offense and then dishing out some punishment of his own. Joe really flew in this match for being such a big guy. Great match 8/10

Impact! - Sonjay Dutt & Amazing Red vs. Triple X - What a great tag team match, seeing as it was only 5 minutes long. A pretty creative ending but we all knew who was going to win, about ten times better than your normal Impact opener, but I don't know how much that's saying. One of Triple X's last matches as Daniels and Primetime were forced to go single at Turning Point. Good match 6/10

Impact! - 6 Man X Division Match - About ten times better than your run-of-the-mill WWE cruiserweight battle royals, as every man is made to look like they could have won it. Rather short at 7 minutes, but I can't complain because of all the action that was shown during that short period. Very funny spot when Red goes to pin someone and all four opponents come in and break it up. This was to determine the #1 contender for the X Divison title at Victory Road. A classic Impact!

8080610,5,B000AYELME,"First of all, I just want to state that I am a true wrestling fan who doesn't really care which organization whether be WWE, TNA or even ROH in which I just look forward to great quality wrestling no matter who showcases it. Anyways, I am a little late in picking up this DVD recently so I have seen the majority of these matches beforehand & it reminded me why I loved watching wrestling & one of the reasons was the X-Division as I always felt this division was very similar to WCW's cruiserweight division except this division, was no limits meaning a big man like Samoa Joe can get involved in the action as well.

20 Man X Gauntlet. This was a battle royal that was very similar to the way the WWE would do it's annual Royal Rumble with the only catch being that when it's down to two wrestlers, its a regular wrestling match. This was a fun match to watch with many exciting sequences with Kaz putting on a great performance for being the longest in the match along with memorable faces like Spanky, Psichosis, La Parka, Hector Garza along with regular TNA wrestlers like Chris Sabin, Matt Bentley & Sonjay Dutt.
(Victory Road '04)

X-Division Champion Petey Williams vs AJ Styles. Honestly, I enjoyed their match at Genesis after this more (which is on AJ's second DVD release) as this match ended when it was just getting better but also the constant interference from Scott D. was really becoming annoying to the point that it took away from the match. Again, their Genesis match easily topped this one.
(Victory Road '04)

Chris Sabin vs Christopher Daniels. This match was exactly what you expected it to be & that it was non-stop action right from the opening bell with two underrated performers. The only negative thing is that this match is clipped.
(Impact)

Ultimate X Match: X-Division Champion Petey Williams vs AJ Styles vs Chris Sabin. This was a very special match for me since this was the first one that I saw & till this day, this match still blows me away & words really don't do it justice. One moment that really gets me is the part where Sabin springboard dropkicked Styles who was hanging from one of the ropes & flipped inside out.
(Final Resolution '05)

Iron Man Match: X-Division Champion AJ Styles vs Christopher Daniels. Before they would go on to have classic battles involving Samoa Joe, they started here in what I still consider to be my favorite encounter between these two & the match of the night of this PPV as they put on an awesome performance. Just thirty minutes of great mat-wrestling with the high-flying coming into effect many times before going into sudden death.
(Against All Odds '05)

Ultimate X Match: X-Division Champion AJ Styles vs Christopher Daniels vs Primetime vs Ron ""The Truth"" Killings. This was actually much different than the previous X match as this match started off as a tag team match with the person losing the fall being eliminated. Once that happens, the match becomes a triple threat & when one more person is eliminated then the X match begins. I won't give away what happens but I will say that even though this was a long match due to all of the rules, this match didn't disappoint & just like the last X match, the ending was very creative & unique.
(Destination X '05)

Ultimate Xscape Match: Mexican Shocker vs Chris Sabin vs Sonjay Dutt vs Matt Bentley. Just like the previous match, two participants needed to be eliminated in order the Xscape match to fully begin. Another great match as everyone was given a chance to shine at one point & another but the real highlight of this match was the moonsault that Trinity did off the top of the cage that got the crowd the loudest they have been throughout the match.
(LockDown '05)

AJ Styles vs Sean Waltman w/Special Referee Jerry Lynn. For those that don't know, Jerry Lynn has a history with both of these men making him the wild card in this match but he really didn't become a factor in this match. This was the best performance that I have seen from Waltman in a long time while we all know that Styles never disappoints in the ring. It wasn't a classic but a really good match to watch as both men meshed well together.
(No Surrender '05)

Samoa Joe vs Chris Sabin. This is the only Joe match on the DVD set. I remember during this time that Joe was squashing all of his opponents but this was the first that I remember seeing in which someone took the fight to Joe which is what the underrated Sabin did. A really competitive match with Sabin pulling off some offense on Joe that nobody had done during this time while Joe showed signs of his future greatness with his stiff ""shootfighting"" style of stiff kicks & submission holds while at the same time showing that for a man his size is still capable of moving quickly & do what the other X-Division wrestlers can do as well.
(No Surrender '05)

The final clip is an interview with Jerry Lynn in which he talks about his wrestling career, his worst injuries, favorite matches, the difference between working an independent market as opposed to a major wrestling promotion like WWE or WCW, his favorite moments (including winning the ECW Title) & what he wants to be remembered for in his career.

Overall, if you are a huge fan of cruiserweight action then this is one DVD worth going out of your way to see,",1263513600,,5300,4.539267015706806

TNA- Best of the X-Division Vol. 1
If you are looking to get into TNA or to relive some of TNA's amazing X-Division action, this is the DVD for you. It has amazing Ultimate X matches, Ironman Match, and Steel Cage matches. The X-Division Stars are some of the most talented wrestlers in the world and this DVD shows why. There is plenty of hard-hitting, high-flying action packed in this DVD for anyone to love. This DVD only featured matches from the TNA 3-Hour PPV Era, at least from the first year of it.

-Disc 1-

Victory Road 2004
20 Man X Gauntlet
This is a fantastic choice to start off this DVD. You get to see 20 different X-Division stars fighting it out for the World X Cup. Big names like Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt, Psychosis, L.A. Park, Kazarian, and so many more are in this match. The match features stars from TNA, Japan, and Mexico. There are too many great spots to name. This loses a point for the ending being weak.
RATING- 9/10

Victory Road 2004
X-Division Title Match
Petey Williams(c) VS AJ Styles
This is a great X-Division title Match from TNA's first ever 3-hour PPV. These two put on a great show. There was a lot of interference, which is never good in a X-Division contest. Some say the match is too short, I feel that it had a perfect length. The ending features one of the sickest Canadian Destroyers I've ever seen.
RATING- 8.5/10

TNA iMPACT!
Chris Sabin VS Christopher Daniels
This is more of a lead-in to the next match. They are fighting for a spot in the Final Resolution Ultimate X match. They put on a decent match with its good spots. Still, not that long and you knew who was going to win anyway.
RATING- 6/10

Final Resolution 2005
Ultimate X Match- X-Division Title
Petey Williams(c) VS AJ Styles VS Chris Sabin
We have reached our first Ultimate X match on the DVD, and now you can see why it's such a big deal in TNA. AJ gets turned inside out and falls 15 feet, Sabin dropkicks AJ while on the turnbuckle, and AJ gets hit with one of a devastating Canadian Destroyer. There are just too many sick spots to name. The ending is insane, as you didn't see it coming at all.
RATING- 10/10

Against All Odds 2005 (Match of the DVD)
30-Minute Ironman Match- X-Division Title
AJ Styles(c) VS Christopher Daniels
This is our second match in a row that scored a 10. This is why this DVD is 5 stars. It is packed full of great matches. This is my second favorite match of all-time. These two put on one of the greatest Ironman matches ever. It's not like others you've seen; it's extremely fast paced. The match is incredible and the ending is even more incredible.
RATING- 10/10

-Disc 2-

Destination X 2005
Ultimate X Challenge- X-Division Title
AJ Styles(c) VS ""Primetime"" Elix Skipper VS Christopher Daniels VS Ron ""Truth"" Killings
The way this match worked was through a series of 3 matches. It started as a tag match between Styles/Primetime and Daniels/Killings. The person who gets pinned is eliminated and you move on to a triple threat match. Then after another elimination, the Ultimate X match finally begins. The rules of the match make this one very interesting. It's cool seeing the interaction between former Triple X teammates, Daniels and Skipper. Christopher Daniels hits one of the biggest moonsaults ever. Also, Styles pulls off an awesome shooting star press.
RATING- 10/10

Lockdown 2005
Six Sides of Steel- Xscape Match
Chris Sabin VS Matt Bentley VS Sonjay Dutt VS Shocker
I'd like to start this off by saying Shocker sucks. He is sloppy and can't wrestle at all. At least that's what he shows in this match. Sabin does a very good job in this match and does one of the best Liger Bombs I've ever seen. Trinity does a huge Moonsault off the top of the cage...yes, Trinity.
RATING- 7.5/10

No Surrender 2005
Special Referee- Jerry Lynn
AJ Styles VS Sean Waltman
The crafty veteran faces takes on the new young force. Waltman uses his dirty tactics to get the advantage on Styles, but Styles keeps getting up. Waltman hits a sick flip dive to the outside and busts Styles nose and lip wide open. The ending is really cheap and badly done.
RATING- 8/10

No Surrender 2005
Chris Sabin VS Samoa Joe
There had to be at least one Joe match. Samoa Joe dominates most of the match until Sabin hits a wicked dropkick on Joe that sends him into the guardrail. Sabin, yet again, hits an insane Liger Bomb. If you have ever watched TNA though, you know how this one ends.
RATING- 8/10

Extras Include-

AJ Styles VS Alex Shelley VS Kid Kash VS Amazing Red VS Kazarian VS Chris Sabin
Nothing much here, but a fun match to watch.

Triple X VS Sonjay Dutt & Amazing Red
Just used to show that Triple X was once a team. Average tag team match.

8080612,1,B000AYELME,"Plain and simple this DVD is not worth more than 10 bucks. These matches are all from the past year and a half and should not all have been on this DVD. They had nothing from the Tennessee Era, which was a big disappointment, and was an even bigger mistake. The best thing about this DVD is a pretty lame interview with Jerry Lynn, it might have been boring but at least it was something you never seen before.

The 2 bonus matches are terrible and they don't even edit out the commercials from the broadcast, how freaking low budget is that?

TNA really dropped the ball on this DVD, I hope Volume 2 is much better, but with most of the DVD featuring matches from Impact I highly doubt it. If this truly is the best of this division, then this is one sorry division.",1163721600,,767,4.2465753424657535
8080613,5,B000AYELME,"Let's face it TNA Wrestling has strive for your attention by giving you the best althletic and exciting wrestlers outside the WWE Wrestling box.

TNA's X Division is AWESOME and one of a kind.  You having witness anything until you have seen an Ultimate X Match (which is included on this DVD).  Hell in a Cell? What is that compared to an Ultimate X match?

The WWE tries and tries again by giving you their cruiserwights as reinvented.  WWE Cruiserweight action exclusively on WWE Smackdown...where we push The Great Khali (yes! the actor on the Adam Sandler DVD, The Longest Yard, under special features viewed as a gentle giant but now in the WWE he's vicious...no really he is. Why didn't you want him before the movie came out). Come on WWE it didn't work with ""Tiny"" Lister (aka Zeus) in 1989 why would you do it know? Oh and we push Fit Finlay, wait a minute don't get me wrong Finlay is a great wrestler but wasn't he a road agent one year ago? Wait let's push Mark Henry I mean we've only been trying since 1996! This is the Smackdown brand...are you kidding me?  We should rename it WWE Letdown!

TNA's X Division is only one piece of the puzzle to TNA Wrestling more dominate product.  TNA is a dominate product it's a better style and entertaining program than WWE. TNA wrestlers actual wrestle!  WWE Cruiserweight competition fails because the WWE signs guys like Kid Kash, Jimmy Yang and Tajiri and then don't let them wrestle in the style that got them noticed in the first place.

TNA X Division wrestlers wrestle a very active high flying match and I see them return week after week.  WWE is afraid their cruiserweights will over do it and injure themselves all the time.  Well then why call them high flyers? Call them Gravity Grounded Underweights!

TNA X Division wrestlers are aware of the risk and do get injured but they seem to differ from WWE brainwashed cruiserweights as they don't forget what the fans what to see out of them. Highflying dare devil moves that drop your jaw in AH!  This DVD will prove to you that organized independent high flyers deserve to a national showcase and demand your respect night in and night out.  If you liked the No Holds Barred, bust my but wrestlers of what ECW use to be. Then you will love the TNA Best of the X Division DVD.  I hate to compare them to anyone because they are not the second coming of anyone but the first coming of something original.

And speaking of the ""New"" ECW product...WWE your messing up already it takes more than Kelly stripping at every show (pathetic attempt to attract viewers mind you), more the Sandman just welding his cane at everybody & anybody and more than Sabu's return. Why did you go Sabu? TNA was a perfect fit for you. Now your stuck in a 3 year contract in a WWE product that will fail worse than any World Bodybuilding Federation or Xtreme Football League product ever will. It's only a matter of time when ECW fans relize that the goosebumps aren't there any more and the only true way to relive it is to watch old ECW shows. The new ECW product is decent at best but not good. ECW was about the innovation of violence and bloodshed. Now when I see ECW wrestlers bloody I think about how WWE cringe because they think I hate the bloodshed but I have to give the fans what they want. It's not the SAME! and NEVER will be. You can't replace Bam Bam Bigelow with Big Show, Taz with Tazz, Shane Douglas with Kurt Angle (although Angle is a great wrestler), Justin Credible without the Impact Players posse.

The WWE should have signed new talent like Jimmy Yang, the Spanish Announce Team (Jose & Joel Maximo), Bryan Danielson and Chad Collyer. Thrown contracted wrestlers in Paul London, CM Punk, Gregory Helms and Kurt Angle. Left Sabu where he was (in TNA mind you), Kid Kash where he was on Smackdown and the rest left in retirement or doing independent house shows. Keep Paul Heyman as the mastermind, Tommy Dreamer booking not wrestling, Tazz away from ringside...Joey Styles is a lone commentator he needs no partner! This would have an ECW feeling. Wrestlers who bust their buts because they want you to watch.  You could've of had this and let guys like Balls Mahoney, Terry Funk and Stevie Richards making special cameos. Then if the fan support was there keep them on.  ECW was about creating superstars not stablished ones and NOT about trying to relive old memories. The product was not about who's on the roster put what the roster was all about. Guys earning your respect! I hope your reading Vince and Paul because you messed up already!

Anyway Buy the TNA Best of the X Division Vol. 1 because its very cool, exciting and at the least original wrestling!",1151107200,5,4679,4.533254156769596
