952563,4,6305020310,"Oh, I expected to see a little bit more of Jackie Chan in this movie.  He is maybe in about one qurter of the movie.  I did very much enjoy his acrobatics, besides the martial arts segments.  I was happy to see that Yuen Biao had a brief appearance.  And yes, I know it is mainly Sammo Hung's movie and the crew was charming.  The movie had some martial arts segments, but it's more of a con-comedy.  And a scene where about 50 old cars got smashed seemed oh, way too many.",1097884800,3,473,4.086956521739131
952564,4,6305020310,"JACKIE IS NOT THE STAR! This film is silly but nice silly, you know? It is about a group of ex-cons who try to go clean after being released from prison.",1037059200,2,153,3.967741935483871
952565,5,6305020310,"The ""Lucky Stars"" crew which includes Sammo Hung, Richard Ng, Jacky Chan, etc. show what Kung-Fu Comedy is all about.  This is one of my all time favorite Kung-Fu Comedies, I liked it better than ""My Lucky Stars"" one of my other favorites.  Sammo and Jacky display their fighting skills (although Jacky had a minor role) and Richard Ng is hilarious especially in the ""invisible"" scene.  Their fight scenes (again Richard splits my sides with his ""rope-a-dope"" boxing) and scams just made me keep rewinding and laughing.  This is definitely one to add to your Martial Arts Collection.",1019520000,6,583,4.918367346938775
952566,5,6305020310,"Ok, so Jackie Chan had a background role in this film and most of the humour was immature.  However, I really liked it, especially the invisible scene.  Unfortunately, the subtitled version is now out of print.",1008633600,,210,4.805555555555555
952567,3,6305020310,This movie had some great stunts and fights. especialy the ones with jackie. I didn't like the humor it was just immature.,958262400,,122,4.590909090909091
952568,3,6305020310,"I am a new Jackie Chan fan, and I still enjoyed this film.  Sammo Hung, and his gang of ex-cons/house cleaners are very funny.  The background music also reminds me of a Chinese street performance.  There are a few  good stunts, and good fight scenes in the film, but don't expect great  action. It was made in the 1980's, and it is obviously old.  This film is  much more humor, and less action.  Jackie Chan only has a small role as a  cop, but his scenes are good.",948844800,6,467,4.215909090909091

7881159,3,6305020310,my customer was very happy to get this movie for a decent price. Too bad I had to double ship it (and therefore double price on shipping) to get it where it needed to go.,1370822400,,170,3.8857142857142857
7881160,4,6305020310,"You can't go wrong with an old 80's movie. This movie has it all smart, funny, action, and awesome stunts that will make you say WOW!!
It might not show Jackie Chan allot but he sure does some cool stunts.",1322956800,,205,4.15
7881161,4,6305020310,"Though I purchased this assuming it was going to be a martial arts film, or at least be mostly fighting, it turned out to be a refreshingly funny comedy about 5 ex-cons who try to go legit but get pulled back into crime unbeknownst to them. Jackie Chan isn't even the main character, but his screen time is well spent and the movie overall has opened my eyes to a genre in Chinese comedy.",1229904000,2,388,4.256756756756757
7881162,4,6305020310,"Winners and Sinners (aka Five Lucky Stars) is a film that I liked better the second time I watched it. After shaken off all expectations of a ""Jackie and Sammo"" film and accepted the uneven and scattered nature of this ensemble movie I enjoyed it more. This movie was more important though when it came out then it is considered today. Jackie had a recent flop in Dragon Lord, though I did enjoy the movie, and Golden Harvest had been in a bit of a slump. Producer Leonard Ho got the idea from Cannonball Run (which Jackie Chan and Michael Hui had parts in) to create an assemblage of popular Hong Kong stars to star in this film. Winners and Sinners was a success spawning several sequels and reunited Jackie with Seven Little Fortune alums Sammo and Yuen Biao (who helped with martial art choreography; though his cameo as a fellow CID officer is less than a minute as a quick fight versus Jackie.)

The Five Lucky Stars are cons who after spending their time in jail take a straight job with a cleaning company led by Curly aka Jack So (played by real life democracy advocate John Shum) who was framed for instigating a crowd to do harm in a parody of his real-life exhorts. The other four are Ranks aka Larry (Stanley Fung), Teapot (Sammo Hung who also directed this) as a cat burglar, Vaseline (Charlie Chin) a slick thief, and Exhaust Pipe (Richard Ng who performance was nominated as Best Actor for the Hong Kong Film Awards) who is bad at thieving automobile parts. They all live with Jack's sister known as Sis (Cherie Chung.) Unfortunately they spend way too much time trying to get her attention, leaving a lull in the early parts of the film. However there are some great gags such as Richard Ng thinking he is invisible with Wu Ma's great response to shatter his misconception - ""...pretty good vision even when it comes to small objects"" and a blind couple playing a Rod Stewart song at a carnival.

There are some great stunt and fight scenes led by 7086 (Jackie Chan) a bumbling CID officer who beats up wrong suspects, kills his superior's turtle and accidentally throws a kid's ice cream away. When he is not destroying everything in his path he is part of an awesome stunt scene involving skates (at least he learned something good from The Big Brawl though he is doubled on some of the trickier roller tricks) and part of a good fight scene in a cafeteria with a little person with horrific teeth. The ""ouch factor"" is quite high in one scene where a villain gets kicked out of a window and lands on a concrete ledge than falls to the ground. I have the highest respect for these stuntmen who kill themselves for our enjoyment. This film definitely deserved the Hong Kong award for best Action Choreography.

The story is mostly non-existent until the boilerplate briefcase full of counterfeit bills makes it's appearance. It belongs to Chan Chiu (James Tien always good as a cigar chomping villain) who is head of a triad gang. He was going to trade it to another triad gang led by Ho Man but it got intercepted and eventually and unknowingly in the possession of the Five Lucky Stars Cleaning Company. Of course, Agent 7086 wants this briefcase too.

But this film was not made for the plot. It was made to be a crowd pleasing mixture of comedy and action, both of which it does very well. It parodies the more serious films with scenes such as Charlie Chin and Fung Hark On doing a martial art pose-down fight and the final action scene that blends comedy and stunts takes place in a warehouse which gets me thinking on how many films I have seen that have the last fight scene in a warehouse (rhetorical thought of course). There are some problems with the film besides the inert beginning including he abysmal electronic soundtrack that is eerily reminiscent of Heart of Dragon's soundtrack and the misuse of Lam Ching Ying as Chan's butler Chan. Overall this is an enjoyable film that is fun to watch that showcases several outstanding Hong Kong comedians and several outstanding action performers.",1197936000,,4024,4.600278551532034

7881164,5,6305020310,"Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan... You Bak Guis didn't get it, did you? This was a Sammo Hung movie and if you were brought up in the 60's, 70's and 80's with the genre you would know that not all Chinese movies are about Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan... I am a Jackie Chan fan but I can open my mind to other types of these movies and enjoy the heck out of them.
This movie paid tribute to many of the kung fu fighting movies by making a farce of the fighting. Did you guys hear the tribute to Wong Fei Hung. Oh, sorry... Who's Wong Fei Hung?
Pick it up, sit down, shut up and enjoy the ride. You'll love this movie.",1124150400,4,631,4.015873015873016
7881165,4,6305020310,this is a good look at the precursor to that kind of humor.  You can see how it influences such movies and has some smart writing (even if its sometimes predictable... you must remember it was a new style at the time).  Overall its a fun movie with one great scene (clue: have you ever wanted to be invisible),1122336000,,309,4.220338983050848
