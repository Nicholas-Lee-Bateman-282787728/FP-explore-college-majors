8025497,3,B0002B55UM,"I was rather disappointed with this purchase.  The movie does not live up to the description that it's a ""rousing action adventure"". This is a gross overstatement and deceptive advertising.  I was waiting to see the ""4 Little Fortunes"" do their thing...""exercise their skills and martial arts ""as the description states, but it turns out that they are just 3 regular kids  and one ""kung fu kid"", Sik Siu-loong from Dragon From Shaolin.  Even his martial arts performance is mostly limited  to the final fight.

The real martial arts skills are demonstrated by the adult main characters. a young man and the kids teacher-guardian.  But I didn't buy this dvd because I wanted to see adults fighting adults.  I bought this dvd because I expected to see ""four young fighters"" combat the Japanese.  This movie spends more time on the storyline and less on the action.

If you want to see a teenager demonstrate incredible martial arts skills in a real action-packed movie then buy THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE to see 18-year old Jet Li do his thing in his movie debut.  'This movie was filmed on location of the real Shaolin temple on the Songshan Mountains. The roles were all played by famous martial arts masters and mistresses in Mainland China.'",1252972800,,1235,4.805687203791469
8025498,5,B0002B55UM,"The newer HK kung fu flicks suck these days, but this one is really good.  The fighting is top notch like the movies from last decade, HKs golden era in action flicks.  I was entertained and the story is like the typical Chinese vs. Japanese revenge story.  Also features some cool ninja warriors.",1086739200,,297,4.566037735849057
