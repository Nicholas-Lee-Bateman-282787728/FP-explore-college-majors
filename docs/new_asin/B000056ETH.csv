7931863,5,B000056ETH,"Thank god for this DVD. It features 3 incredible episodes, starting with a swimsuit competition! The group lands on a planet needing to repair the ship. They decide to enter a swimsuit competition in order to win 1 million Jurai as the prize. I don't know what the exchange rate is, but a million of anything is a lot. While the competition rages a new challenger enters...Nagi is back and she's really hot for a change. The prize money may be a lost cause. On a more serious note we get a shocking revelation about Grandpa's past, and the identity of the fake emperor. In episode 22 a duo of Knights that serve the true Royal Family join the heroes to reclaim the throne. This is the beginning of the great conclusion. It's not one you wanna miss out on.",1353024000,,755,4.4

A second outing of a popular show always meets with criticism. The OVA 1 and 2 were/are extremely well made series and very highly thought of (I love them too!) But whilst the OVA has veered off into DragonballZ/impossibly powerful character-world and mass-bigamy on a grand scale, Tenchi Universe is a compact, believable plot which doesn't put unbelievable power on the head of any one character.

This show is not about high powered battles, although there are space encounters, conflicts and the culmination of Tenchi's fight with the series villain to take into account. It's about, pure and simply, PEOPLE.

Tenchi Universe also draws on and develops the character of Kiyone Makibi, whose inclusion puts the series points ahead of anything involving the insufferable Noike. The OVA's continued exile of Kiyone can only be seen as a weakness, as the chemistry between her and Mihoshi is always a source of entertainment. There are also other strong Universe-only characters, such as Nagi, the bounty hunter, and Ken Ohki, her loyal cabbit ship.

The Time and Space Adventures are classic - throwing the cast into humorous situations and even inspiring two characters to make a surprising development in their relationship (no spoilers, but Sasami has some odd ideas!) There is also the relief that not everyone who meets Tenchi is automatically in love with him (thank goodness), which allows the characters some breathing space to become something other than his ""harem"". This series is strictly Ayeka and Ryoko vying for his affections, although Sasami might be thinking about it, if she were older.

Whereas the OVA draws a fine line between the major writing no-no of info-dumping on occasion (especially in part three), Tenchi Universe skirts clear of all of the heavy background baggage and instead focuses on the here and now - the problems, trials and tribulations that all these unlikely allies overcome in order to clear their names and ultimately triumph over the universe's major evil. In short it's a series that's moving constantly forward, and rarely looking back. When information is needed, it is explained, but no uneccessary data is heaped into the plot, allowing it to develop character relationships without too much explanatory narrative.

There is a nice balance between humour and tragedy that runs through this series, with events such as the swimsuit competition and Tenchi dressing up as a girl adding a light touch to other more serious undertones. It's also a nice touch that the guardians have proper roles and purposes, instead of just being Ayeka's floating logs (which always bothered me in the original OVA).

I will agree with one reviewer who said that it's a shame there is no Tsunami in this series, although it's fairly obvious that there's more going on with Sasami than is ever fully explained. There are also a couple of continuity blips - one moment when Ayeka talks about Ryoko being imprisoned in a cave for 700 years, for example. However, those things aside, the show is great. The series villain is probably the best Tenchi villain of all, and the handing over of Tenchi-ken is much more effectively handled. There is some sexual innuendo/vulgarity but nothing like the lengths to which the OVA occasionally goes and certainly nothing too extreme. (Very little bathing nudity, even!)

Previous reviewers who criticise the dub must be listening to a different audio track from me, because the VAs all do a good job and are very believable. Petrea Burchard is (as usual) fabulous as Ryoko, (her absence from the newer Tenchi series is a huge loss to the show as a whole and English dub fans mourn). It would be nice if there was more consistency with the suffixes (or if they were actually detailed on the subtitles more often, too). One thing that did bother me was that Kamidake began calling Tenchi ""Tenchi"" instead of Lord Tenchi at one point...while on the Japanese dub he's calling him ""Tenchi-dono"" which makes more sense. Occasionally, therefore, the translation doesn't seem exact - although with dubbing that's probably never 100% possible. (At least Tenchi's mother isn't called his grandmother by mistake...)

If you're a die hard OVA fan, or you're a purist who sticks like glue to the official version as laid down by the original creator, Tenchi Universe is probably not for you. But if you like the characters and want to see them in a slightly new light, this is a great compact series to watch (plus the two spin off movies are worth the effort also, particularly the second!). For some reason this series often seems unpopular with Ayeka fans - but I think there is plenty to enjoy and amuse for fans of all characters in this offering. Definitely my favourite Tenchi continuation, because it recognises so strongly the value of human (alien?) interaction over the development of hugely destructive power.

In my view, more than worth the watch. (Especially episode 24...)",1164672000,2,5018,4.984468339307049
7931865,5,B000056ETH,"The first episode is a swimsuit episode, which is pretty normal for anime, so no surprises there.  The plot is that, once again, the gang needs money.  The ship needs some repair work done and the fastest way to make money, besides the jobs they've taken, is a swimsuit contest in which the winner gets one million Jurai dollars.  Everybody decides to join.  After all, with so many pretty women ONE of them has to win.  Even Nagi joins the contest!  The ending of this episode is no surprise, but it is kind of funny.  I won't give it away.
The next episode is just as funny, even if it does bring us back on track to the main story arch.  Tenchi and the gang need to get past the outer defenses of Jurai space.  So they pretend to be a school group to get through the checkpoint, one of the many space stations that encircle that area of space.  Tenchi even cross-dresses to be a girl!  I don't want to give too much away, but the episode is not just funny, it shows us that not everybody is against our Heros.
The last episode is somewhat serious.  While being chased they enter a sector of space that is forbidden, a sacred place to Jurai.  The shock is that Katsuhito is the one that directed them to fly into it!  He knew it was there and he has brought them to it for a reason.  He has come to uncover two Knights of old, Knights who would awaken to help the Jurai Family in time of great need.  So they land on a planet within the region to find the Knights.  But things don't go as planned.
This last episode can be very confusing but it reveals alot about almost everybody!  Who Katsuhito really is, how willing Sasami is to make friends, so on.  This DVD is a must to understand and enjoy the last DVD in the series.",1087603200,3,1727,4.194528875379939
7931866,5,B000056ETH,"This is the seventh installment of the 8 disc Tenchi Universe series. If you have not seen the prior episodes, many of the events seen in this disc may be somewhat confusing, but that's probably obvious to all.
No Need For Swimsuits showcases the stranded heroes on a refreshing beach paradise planet, and a great way to earn a cool 1 million Jurai: A swimsuit contest! All the girls, excluding Sasami and Washu, dawn their suits and compete for the gold!
No Need for Checkpoints is when Tenchi and the gang must penetrate the Jurai checkpoint in order to continue their journey to planet Jurai itself. Quite comical seeing Tenchi in his disquise, but also it shows a bit into the past of a certain Uncle of Sasami's who tries to aid them in their escape.
No Need for Knights is quite possibly the coolest twist of events in the series, or any Tenchi series for that matter. The gang travels to a planet in the Jurain ""Forbidden Zone"" where they attempt to resurrect two mummified soldiers of Jurai's past. This episode is a must see!!!
This disc, in my opinion, is the best one in the Tenchi Universe series for it's story line continuation. Many new and shocking events come upon the Masaki clan, as well as many comedic moments. The animation quality is excellent, dubbing is also very great in that it doesn't change drastically from the Japanese version, and the user interface is quite easy; cut and dry with no hassles. A must buy for any fan of Tenchi or of good action and comedy.",1020297600,,1489,4.559701492537314
7931867,5,B000056ETH,"Welcome to some of the greatest TV shows of all time. Of all the Tenchi series, Universe is the best, and in these episodes toward the end of the series, it really starts to pick up the pace. I don't know what I'd do with out Tenchi universe. The animation is top-notch, and It's good subbed or dubbed. Pioneer really brought a masterpiece over here stateside, and did a good job localizing it, but also keeping true to the original. If you like anime, and haven't seen this series, you've got to pick this one up right now. As for the extras, it's just like all the other Tenchi Universe one, but still fun to check out. Nothing extraordinarly though.",982281600,4,652,4.441666666666666
