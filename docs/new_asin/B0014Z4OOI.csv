3136126,2,B0014Z4OOI,"Note: This is more of a review of the DVD quality and not the plot, voice acting, or music. I give the movie 5 stars animation wise and 4 Stars for the story. If this is re-released with much better quality I will definitely give a full five star review to this.

DVD Quality Review:
I bought the NTSC version that is available and was disappointed when I found out that there is no widescreen version available. It would have been great if Viz media had the option to choose between the two. Unfortunately, I found out this seems to be a problem with Viz Media and some of their DVD releases.

When you change a Widescreen feature into NTSC you cut 30%-40% off the entire movie.

The results are characters being cut off from the edges and messing up the composition and feeling of entire scenes. There's also some grain to the film when you watch it. Also, watching fullscreen conversions on widescreen displays can result in jagged lines around the characters and pillar boxing on the sides if you don't stretch it to fit the screen.

Special Features:

There's absolutely no special features. You'd expect them to include at least a movie trailer.",1420675200,,1151,4.595121951219512

3136129,3,B0014Z4OOI,"Like the other pokemon moives, this one is just not that exciting. Palkia the ruler of space and dilgia the ruler of time met. They started to attack each other. One attack after the other. Palkias pearls on its shoulders stared to glow. Dilgias diamond on its chest stared to glow. Palkia unleashes a pink energy band that was heading towards dilgia. Dilgia shoots a blue beam from its moth. The two attacks hit each other and a explosion of energy went everywhere. Palkia uses the same attack again. Dilgia makes a blue bubble to Protect itself from the attack. Dilgia then used the same attack it used. Palkia used its pearl as a shield. But the pearl cracked. Palkia was in pain and more mad then ever. It flew off, but dilgia went after it. In almos town ash, dawn, and Brock were trying to capture darkari. Darkai was using a attack that made pokemon and people to go to sleep. Ash thought that darkai was trying to hurt everyone. He went after it. Darkai said go away like if wanted to warn ash with something. Ash got hit with the attack. He had a dream. He saw palkia. He was scared. Pikachu was in his dream too. They fell into a hole. Pikachu used thunderbolt. Ash woke up. It was all a dream. Still he wanted to get darkai. Later darkai returned. He put everyone to sleep. Ash told pikachu to use a thunsderbolt on darkai. He got it. Pikachu then used bolt tackle. Darkai used a double team. All the sudden the sky turned Gray. People tried to leave almos town, but when they on the bridge they come right back to almos. Ash tried it, but he came right back. Then tonyo, there friend showed ash and his friends palkia. Palkia was in almos town. Ash saw darkai use his attack on palkia. Palkia woke up from sleeping. It attacked darkai. Ash and his friends saw palkias broken pearl. Palkia was probably in a lot of pain. Palkia attacked darkai. All the sudden a bunch of rocks came down from the sky. It was dilgia. It came, ready to fight palkia. The two powerful pokemon tackled each other and flipped each other over. Then palkias pearls stared to glow. Dilgias diamond stared to glow. Palkias pink band unleashed from its body. Dilgias blue beam unleashed from its body. The two attacks hit with increbitacbe force. Darkai went to stop them. He tried to put the two pokemon to sleep, but a pink bubble protected palkia and a blue bubble protected dilgia. Ash was shocked. Palkia and dilgia hit darkai with a hyper beam attack and a aura sphere attack. Ash and his friends went to help darkai but it went to save almos town. Whenever palkia or dilgias attacks are going to hit the two towers the space and time towers, darkai protects it. Tonyo had a idea. He wanted ash and dawn to get ocrosin, a song that can clam pokemon down. So ash and dawn went to the space time towers and got a cricle that plays the song ocrosin. They ran up the stairs as fast as they could. Almos town was in danger because palkia and dilgias attacks were destroying the town. Brocks pokemon tried there best to help. Palkia and dilgia were going to use there strongest attacks again. Tonyo said that if they do it, almos will be done for. When there attacks almost hit each other, darkai went in front of them. He hold them together. Ash and dawn were almost to the top. Darkai couldn't hold it any more. A huge explosion went everywhere. Darkai disappeared from almos. Ash and dawn quickly put the tape in. But the power was gone. Pikachu used its thunderbolt attack to give it power. Before palkia and dilgia were going to use there strongest attack, the song went on. They stopped. Everyone heard and listened. The towers grew wings. Palkia and dilgia calmed down. Palkias pearl healed. The music stoped everything. Dilgia and palkia looked at each other and dilgia left. Palkia looked upset about what it did. Ash asked palkia to turn everything back to normal. Palkia did and almos was safe and sound. Everyone was happy but darkai was still gone. Ash said he was sorry for not believing darkai. But darkai was back and ash and his friends were happy.

That would've been more interesting. Better yet, I wish this movie was actually about Darkrai, because Darkrai is a more interesting Pokemon than either Palkia or Dialga. Still, this movie is better than many of the previous Pokemon movies. At least it has some really powerful Pokemon going at it. Hopefully the next movie (Arceus and the Jewel of Life) will be good, because the one after that (Phantom Ruler: Zoroark) is supposedly pretty bad.",1292025600,2,608,4.970588235294118

3136174,3,B0014Z4OOI,"Pokemon: The Rise of Darkrai is the tenth film in the Pokemon franchise, and it's the final Pokemon film to be distributed in the United States by Viz Media.  The Rise of Darkrai is a decent Pokemon film, and it tells a good story.  However, it felt like there were more attempts to integrate CG animation than in previous films.  Compared to the other films that utilized the computer graphics, the CG in this film sticks out even worse than in the previous films and draws way too much attention to itself.

Unlike the previous two Pokemon films, The Rise of Darkrai was a single disc DVD release.  On the disc, you can watch the film, you can use the setup menu to set your audio and subtitle preferences, and you can choose where in the film you want to start watching.  For audio options, you can choose either 5.1 Surround or Stereo.  For subtitles, you can choose either English or Spanish.  When I put this disc into my Blu-Ray player, my player automatically put the English subtitles on the screen.  Since there is no option for turning off subtitles in the set-up menu, I had to use the ""Subtitle"" menu on my Blu-Ray player's remote to turn off the subtitles.  However, when I later put this disc into a computer DVD drive, the English subtitles did not automatically appear on the screen.

The Rise of Darkrai is the first DVD release of a Pokemon film to not include any kind of special features.  When this film was first released on DVD, it cost about the same amount as a DVD that contained bonus features.  However, over time, the price has come down to something that is a little more reasonable for what you get.  If you can find a copy of The Rise of Darkrai that's selling for under $15, I would recommend purchasing it.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1286841600,5,1846,4.4523809523809526
3136175,5,B0014Z4OOI,"This movie is one of the stranger pokemon movies, but it was still a blast to watch! I was kept on the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the next movie!",1280880000,,152,3.6363636363636362
3136176,4,B0014Z4OOI,"`Rise of Darkrai' represents the point in the Pokemon movie series when the production quality took a dramatic upswing. Many of the previous movies featured bland, simplistic plots, uninspired animation and simple bubblegum pop music. They were geared towards kids and generally kids were the only ones who would enjoy them while adults merely endured them. The Diamond/Pearl trilogy is in my opinion the current pinnacle of the Pokemon series. The character animation is a huge improvement with more detail and fluid movement and the backgrounds are often quite gorgeous. Many of the earlier movies featured excessive padding that often grew quite tedious. By contrast, even the downtimes in `Rise of Darkrai' are ok because the visuals and music are so beautiful that the viewer can just sit back and enjoy.

This movie begins a battle between the Pokemon gods of time and space, Palkia and Dialga, that will span the next two movies. The unfortunate city of Alamos Town manages to get swept up in an initially unseen conflict unbeknownst to its citizens. Meanwhile the nightmare inducing Pokemon Darkrai is being blamed for strange happenings in Alamos Town. Is the black and tattered Darkrai a villain or a hero? When Alamos Town begins to literally crumble to dust Darkrai might be the only thing standing in the way of complete obliteration.

The plot is much tighter in `Rise of Darkrai' than prior Pokemon movies with less cute scenes and a somewhat more mature plot. A lot of the previous movies tended to be rather vapid and forgettable but this one might just stick with the viewer a bit. It's the first Pokemon movie I've seen where adults might actually get into the story rather than zone out while the kids watch it. In fact an adult might possibly even watch this one without a child just for pure enjoyment sake. Now don't get me wrong. This isn't Miyazaki and the animation still cuts some corners with the classic statue figures with the moving mouths but I found it very pleasant visually and the music has a deep cinematic feel to it. I previously review `Giratina and the Sky Warrior' and gave it five stars but this one isn't quite as good so I'm giving it four stars. I think viewers who haven't seen this movie will be pleasantly surprised by the work the animators did in creating Alamos Town which is based on Barcelona Spain and possesses a very dreamy ethereal look. It contrasts well with the dark realm in which Dialga and Palkia do battle. These kinds of movies definitely show that the Pokemon series has plenty of life left in it.",1277337600,,2564,4.7725225225225225

In spite of the general premise that the Pokemon are used to ""battle' each other, which I was initially uncomfortable with, the stories of the TV show and this movie in particular tend to leave the children watching with a positive message. Darkrai is fighting to save the town he calls home while Ash, Brock, Dawn, and others mistakenly assume he is one of the bad guys. In the end they realize they were wrong about Darkrai and feel regret and a deep sense of loss at Darkrai's selfless sacrifice on their behalf. But, not to worry, the movie ends on a happy note. Let's just say the title says it all. Any Pokemon fan will love this movie and those coming to Pokemon for the first time will enjoy it just as much.",1222732800,7,823,4.248407643312102

Usually, this dvds come loaded with extras, as short movies, more content, etc. but in this case ONLY THE MOVIE...not even Japanese Language (I like the original voices).",1212192000,,268,4.702127659574468
3136196,5,B0014Z4OOI,"I'm an avid DVD collector who loves collecting series.  I got ""The Rise of Darkrai"" because one of the series I collect is Pokemon.  Both the movies and the series (in order up to Orange Islands now).  This DVD is welcome being that it is a movie.  There is no special features.  I am entirely grateful for it.  However, I dislike the fact that I'm forced to sit through a Mystery Dungeon preview every time I put the disc in.  I can't skip it.  No fast forward, no rewind, no chapter ahead, nothing, you have to sit through it.  Kinda cruel considering there are no special features.  It makes me think they release this DVD just to market Mystery Dungeon.

EDIT:  I think it's funny that during the end credits when they are giving the music credits, they spell Darkrai wrong.",1212019200,3,778,4.439716312056738
3136197,3,B0014Z4OOI,"There is some good news and some bad news with this DVD. First off, it's a 1.85:1 Widescreen presentation, video is nice and clear. Comes with a 5.1 Dolby Digital (if I recall correctly) track as well as normal stereo. English and Spanish subtitles. That's the good news. Ok, on to the bad news. For the folks looking for the Japanese audio track, DO NOT PURCHASE as it doesn't have one. Kinda disappointing. There are also no special features on the disc, none at all. Is a preview of Movie 11, or a commentary track to much to ask for. Seriously, the only real reason I bought this is because I love Pokmon so much. The widescreen is a plus, but the lack of special features, commentary, and a japanese audio track kinda defeats the purpose of it being on DVD. I'm still hoping for the day when VIZ and PUSA (Pokmon USA Inc. for those you don't know) announce/release remastered special editions of all the movies and an uncut (that means all the banned episode included too lol), remastered version of the show. Seriously it's time they started treating this series with some love. I know Pokmon is still marketed mainly towards kids, but what about us 20-somethings that watched this show from the very beginning. Anyway hope this review helped and sorry it kinda turned into a mini rant. :D",1211846400,3,1295,4.586206896551724

DVD Quality Review:
I bought the NTSC version that is available and was disappointed when I found out that there is no widescreen version available. It would have been great if Viz media had the option to choose between the two. Unfortunately, I found out this seems to be a problem with Viz Media and some of their DVD releases.

When you change a Widescreen feature into NTSC you cut 30%-40% off the entire movie.

The results are characters being cut off from the edges and messing up the composition and feeling of entire scenes. There's also some grain to the film when you watch it. Also, watching fullscreen conversions on widescreen displays can result in jagged lines around the characters and pillar boxing on the sides if you don't stretch it to fit the screen.

Special Features:

There's absolutely no special features. You'd expect them to include at least a movie trailer.",1420675200,,1151,4.595121951219512

3370626,3,B0014Z4OOI,"Like the other pokemon moives, this one is just not that exciting. Palkia the ruler of space and dilgia the ruler of time met. They started to attack each other. One attack after the other. Palkias pearls on its shoulders stared to glow. Dilgias diamond on its chest stared to glow. Palkia unleashes a pink energy band that was heading towards dilgia. Dilgia shoots a blue beam from its moth. The two attacks hit each other and a explosion of energy went everywhere. Palkia uses the same attack again. Dilgia makes a blue bubble to Protect itself from the attack. Dilgia then used the same attack it used. Palkia used its pearl as a shield. But the pearl cracked. Palkia was in pain and more mad then ever. It flew off, but dilgia went after it. In almos town ash, dawn, and Brock were trying to capture darkari. Darkai was using a attack that made pokemon and people to go to sleep. Ash thought that darkai was trying to hurt everyone. He went after it. Darkai said go away like if wanted to warn ash with something. Ash got hit with the attack. He had a dream. He saw palkia. He was scared. Pikachu was in his dream too. They fell into a hole. Pikachu used thunderbolt. Ash woke up. It was all a dream. Still he wanted to get darkai. Later darkai returned. He put everyone to sleep. Ash told pikachu to use a thunsderbolt on darkai. He got it. Pikachu then used bolt tackle. Darkai used a double team. All the sudden the sky turned Gray. People tried to leave almos town, but when they on the bridge they come right back to almos. Ash tried it, but he came right back. Then tonyo, there friend showed ash and his friends palkia. Palkia was in almos town. Ash saw darkai use his attack on palkia. Palkia woke up from sleeping. It attacked darkai. Ash and his friends saw palkias broken pearl. Palkia was probably in a lot of pain. Palkia attacked darkai. All the sudden a bunch of rocks came down from the sky. It was dilgia. It came, ready to fight palkia. The two powerful pokemon tackled each other and flipped each other over. Then palkias pearls stared to glow. Dilgias diamond stared to glow. Palkias pink band unleashed from its body. Dilgias blue beam unleashed from its body. The two attacks hit with increbitacbe force. Darkai went to stop them. He tried to put the two pokemon to sleep, but a pink bubble protected palkia and a blue bubble protected dilgia. Ash was shocked. Palkia and dilgia hit darkai with a hyper beam attack and a aura sphere attack. Ash and his friends went to help darkai but it went to save almos town. Whenever palkia or dilgias attacks are going to hit the two towers the space and time towers, darkai protects it. Tonyo had a idea. He wanted ash and dawn to get ocrosin, a song that can clam pokemon down. So ash and dawn went to the space time towers and got a cricle that plays the song ocrosin. They ran up the stairs as fast as they could. Almos town was in danger because palkia and dilgias attacks were destroying the town. Brocks pokemon tried there best to help. Palkia and dilgia were going to use there strongest attacks again. Tonyo said that if they do it, almos will be done for. When there attacks almost hit each other, darkai went in front of them. He hold them together. Ash and dawn were almost to the top. Darkai couldn't hold it any more. A huge explosion went everywhere. Darkai disappeared from almos. Ash and dawn quickly put the tape in. But the power was gone. Pikachu used its thunderbolt attack to give it power. Before palkia and dilgia were going to use there strongest attack, the song went on. They stopped. Everyone heard and listened. The towers grew wings. Palkia and dilgia calmed down. Palkias pearl healed. The music stoped everything. Dilgia and palkia looked at each other and dilgia left. Palkia looked upset about what it did. Ash asked palkia to turn everything back to normal. Palkia did and almos was safe and sound. Everyone was happy but darkai was still gone. Ash said he was sorry for not believing darkai. But darkai was back and ash and his friends were happy.

3370671,3,B0014Z4OOI,"Pokemon: The Rise of Darkrai is the tenth film in the Pokemon franchise, and it's the final Pokemon film to be distributed in the United States by Viz Media.  The Rise of Darkrai is a decent Pokemon film, and it tells a good story.  However, it felt like there were more attempts to integrate CG animation than in previous films.  Compared to the other films that utilized the computer graphics, the CG in this film sticks out even worse than in the previous films and draws way too much attention to itself.

Unlike the previous two Pokemon films, The Rise of Darkrai was a single disc DVD release.  On the disc, you can watch the film, you can use the setup menu to set your audio and subtitle preferences, and you can choose where in the film you want to start watching.  For audio options, you can choose either 5.1 Surround or Stereo.  For subtitles, you can choose either English or Spanish.  When I put this disc into my Blu-Ray player, my player automatically put the English subtitles on the screen.  Since there is no option for turning off subtitles in the set-up menu, I had to use the ""Subtitle"" menu on my Blu-Ray player's remote to turn off the subtitles.  However, when I later put this disc into a computer DVD drive, the English subtitles did not automatically appear on the screen.

The Rise of Darkrai is the first DVD release of a Pokemon film to not include any kind of special features.  When this film was first released on DVD, it cost about the same amount as a DVD that contained bonus features.  However, over time, the price has come down to something that is a little more reasonable for what you get.  If you can find a copy of The Rise of Darkrai that's selling for under $15, I would recommend purchasing it.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1286841600,5,1846,4.4523809523809526

3370673,4,B0014Z4OOI,"`Rise of Darkrai' represents the point in the Pokemon movie series when the production quality took a dramatic upswing. Many of the previous movies featured bland, simplistic plots, uninspired animation and simple bubblegum pop music. They were geared towards kids and generally kids were the only ones who would enjoy them while adults merely endured them. The Diamond/Pearl trilogy is in my opinion the current pinnacle of the Pokemon series. The character animation is a huge improvement with more detail and fluid movement and the backgrounds are often quite gorgeous. Many of the earlier movies featured excessive padding that often grew quite tedious. By contrast, even the downtimes in `Rise of Darkrai' are ok because the visuals and music are so beautiful that the viewer can just sit back and enjoy.

This movie begins a battle between the Pokemon gods of time and space, Palkia and Dialga, that will span the next two movies. The unfortunate city of Alamos Town manages to get swept up in an initially unseen conflict unbeknownst to its citizens. Meanwhile the nightmare inducing Pokemon Darkrai is being blamed for strange happenings in Alamos Town. Is the black and tattered Darkrai a villain or a hero? When Alamos Town begins to literally crumble to dust Darkrai might be the only thing standing in the way of complete obliteration.

The plot is much tighter in `Rise of Darkrai' than prior Pokemon movies with less cute scenes and a somewhat more mature plot. A lot of the previous movies tended to be rather vapid and forgettable but this one might just stick with the viewer a bit. It's the first Pokemon movie I've seen where adults might actually get into the story rather than zone out while the kids watch it. In fact an adult might possibly even watch this one without a child just for pure enjoyment sake. Now don't get me wrong. This isn't Miyazaki and the animation still cuts some corners with the classic statue figures with the moving mouths but I found it very pleasant visually and the music has a deep cinematic feel to it. I previously review `Giratina and the Sky Warrior' and gave it five stars but this one isn't quite as good so I'm giving it four stars. I think viewers who haven't seen this movie will be pleasantly surprised by the work the animators did in creating Alamos Town which is based on Barcelona Spain and possesses a very dreamy ethereal look. It contrasts well with the dark realm in which Dialga and Palkia do battle.

In spite of the general premise that the Pokemon are used to ""battle' each other, which I was initially uncomfortable with, the stories of the TV show and this movie in particular tend to leave the children watching with a positive message. Darkrai is fighting to save the town he calls home while Ash, Brock, Dawn, and others mistakenly assume he is one of the bad guys. In the end they realize they were wrong about Darkrai and feel regret and a deep sense of loss at Darkrai's selfless sacrifice on their behalf. But, not to worry, the movie ends on a happy note. Let's just say the title says it all. Any Pokemon fan will love this movie and those coming to Pokemon for the first time will enjoy it just as much.",1222732800,7,823,4.248407643312102

Both the movies and the series (in order up to Orange Islands now).  This DVD is welcome being that it is a movie.  There is no special features.  I am entirely grateful for it.  However, I dislike the fact that I'm forced to sit through a Mystery Dungeon preview every time I put the disc in.  I can't skip it.  No fast forward, no rewind, no chapter ahead, nothing, you have to sit through it.  Kinda cruel considering there are no special features.  It makes me think they release this DVD just to market Mystery Dungeon.

EDIT:  I think it's funny that during the end credits when they are giving the music credits, they spell Darkrai wrong.",1212019200,3,778,4.439716312056738
3370694,3,B0014Z4OOI,"There is some good news and some bad news with this DVD. First off, it's a 1.85:1 Widescreen presentation, video is nice and clear. Comes with a 5.1 Dolby Digital (if I recall correctly) track as well as normal stereo. English and Spanish subtitles. That's the good news. Ok, on to the bad news. For the folks looking for the Japanese audio track, DO NOT PURCHASE as it doesn't have one. Kinda disappointing. There are also no special features on the disc, none at all. Is a preview of Movie 11, or a commentary track to much to ask for. Seriously, the only real reason I bought this is because I love Pokmon so much. The widescreen is a plus, but the lack of special features, commentary, and a japanese audio track kinda defeats the purpose of it being on DVD. I'm still hoping for the day when VIZ and PUSA (Pokmon USA Inc. for those you don't know) announce/release remastered special editions of all the movies and an uncut (that means all the banned episode included too lol), remastered version of the show. Seriously it's time they started treating this series with some love. I know Pokmon is still marketed mainly towards kids, but what about us 20-somethings that watched this show from the very beginning. Anyway hope this review helped and sorry it kinda turned into a mini rant. :D",1211846400,3,1295,4.586206896551724

Also the first D/P movie and usually the first film in a new region is wonderful. This film also features more types of pokemon than anyother movie before it to help celebrate the 10 year anniversary. This is a must see for all pokemon fans.,1205884800,24,400,4.276315789473684

8256652,3,B0014Z4OOI,"Summary of the movie (warning spoilers)

The Beginning of the movie is confusing. It starts with a battle between Palkia and Dialga.  It doesn't explain why they are fighting, but they expect the audience to not ask too many questions. Fleeing, Palkia ends up in the town that Ash and his friends are visiting for a Pokmon contest. He brings havoc in his wake which initially gets blamed on Darkrai. Ash and the others battle Darkrai but soon discover Palkia's presence. Chasing Palkia, Dialga appears and the entire town begins to collapse into another dimension.  The creator of the town, Cody, dreamed this would happen long ago and built a speaker to play a soothing melody which apparently no one knows about except one girl, Alice, who plays it on a leaf instrument. Darkrai risks his life to protect the town while Ash and Pikachu race to play the music. They make it with seconds to spare.  The two legendary Pokmon stop fighting. Ash pleads for Palkia to put things right.  Palkia and Dialga go back home. Darkrai goes from feared to celebrated.

Problems:

No explanation for why Palkia and Dialga are fighting which is the driving action of the entire movie.

Darkrai is living in Alice's garden because of her grandmother Alisha who saved his life once upon a time. Again no explanation other than sweet girl meets helplessly misunderstood Pokemon.

Cody, the creator of the town, built the towers that house the clock and music player because of a nightmare he had. Was this due to Darkrai?  It's alluded that this may be the case but why?  What is Cody to Darkrai?  Was Cody his Pokemon master, friend, pet, boyfriend?

Now for the worst part...Ash running up the stairs to the top of this Eiffel Tower building.  This was probably a third of the movie and while he is doing this, Darkrai is risking his life. As they make their forever way up, they stop intermittently to watch their dying friend. Finally when he does ""die"" they decide that they should move quicker or they will be no more. Seriously, count how many times they say ""Look, watch Darkrai!""

My daughter and I were yelling at the show and Ash and wishing that Darkrai had better friends.

All in all, worth watching, but why didn't they just fly their balloon up and play the dang song on the leaf instrument.  Considering that they were close enough to be hit by these legendary Pokmon.

Conclusion:  Poor Darkrai. Humans are so disappointing.",1501459200,,2424,4.701421800947867
