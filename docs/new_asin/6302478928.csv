468438,3,6302478928,"CAPTAIN SINDBAD IS GUY WILLIAMS AT HIS BEST!!!  In between his roles as tv's ZORRO in the late 1950s and as Professor John Robinson on tv's LOST IN SPACE in the mid to late 1960s, Guy Williams took his family to Europe in 1961 when he went to make 3 movies, the third of which was 1963's CAPTAIN SINDBAD, made in Germany.
CAPTAIN SINDBAD'S story is simple:21 year old German singer and dancer Heidi Bruhl plays the beautiful Princess Jana, who is about to be forced to marry the evil El Karim, who has seized control of the kingdom of Baristan from her father.  The villain El Karim is played by sensational Mexican character actor Pedro Amandariz, who went on to play someone with a very similar name--Kerim Bey--the same year with Sean Connery in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.
CAPTAIN SINDBAD is supposed to be a b movie for kids, but there are some good adult scenes with Williams as Captain Sindbad, his German costar Heidi Bruhl as the Princess Jana, and Amandariz--especially an unusual dream sequence with Bruhl and Williams-- that make it an interesting romantic fantasy.
CAPTAIN SINDBAD'S music and choreography are terrific too, but the star of CAPTAIN SINDBAD is Guy Williams, better looking than Clark Gable, taller and more rugged than Tyrone Power, and unlike Sean Connery, American, and with a unique ability to use his v shaped torso, his beautiful hair, his height, his unbelievably handsome face, his mannerisms, and his distinct speech patterns to project himself as THE ULTIMATE LEADING MAN OF ACTION!!!  When Guy Williams appears on screen for the first time in CAPTAIN SINDBAD, there's something about him that jumps out at the screen and says, ""Everything's going to be all right!!!""  He seems to convince Heidi Bruhl, too, because in CAPTAIN SINDBAD she looks and acts as if she is really in love with Guy Williams!!!  (And an interesting real life subplot is that the very next year, Heidi Bruhl married an American actor Brett Halsey, who looked very much like Guy Williams, and once even was in a 1950s movie with him!)
Director Byron Haskin also does a terrific job of showcasing Williams' strengths and covering his one physical flaw, the same flaw that kept Guy Williams from becoming Hollywood's #1 leading man, and the same flaw that keeps CAPTAIN SINDBAD from being a great movie, since we just don't get to see enough of Guy Williams, but even so, CAPTAIN SINDBAD IS GUY WILLIAMS AT HIS BEST!!!

This movie has to be THE absolute, corniest movie that I have EVER seen!! The fake 'creatures' that Sinbad (Williams) has to deal with are laughable. The story in general is rather pathetic.

I was lucky enough to witness this epic at the theater, in all of its titanic glory! What was so special about this movie for a 9-10 year old kid? Monsters! Magic!! Adventure!!! I sat mesmerized as Sindbad (Guy Williams) led his men on their quest to defeat the eeevil wizard, El Karim (Pedro Armendariz), and his gauntlet of killer creatures! These include a multi-headed dragon beast, and a gigantic, disembodied hand! Our heroes must fight their way through these formidable freaks, in order to destroy the disembodied heart of El Karim, which is kept in crystal, at the top of a dark tower!  Like many bored teens, I played DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS in high school. Having never forgotten this film, I incorporated (ok, I stole many ideas!) much of the atmosphere and monster / battle action in my dungeons!

468681,2,6302478928,"I understand the power of nostalgia, and the many attractive qualities of Guy Williams, but these 4 and 5 star reviews of ""Captain Sindbad"" leave me scratching my head.  The movie is molasses-slow and almost unwatchable, which is a great pity, since the costumes and sets are quite serviceable, and Guy Williams, Pedro Armendariz, and Abraham Sofaer can be wonderful when given a proper script.  That's what kills this film: a really bad screenplay.

To begin with, the movie is called ""Captain Sindbad"", but apart from Sindbad coming home from a voyage, very little actually takes place on the sea.  The film would have been more properly titled ""Sindbad and the Usurper"" or ""Sindbad and the Deathless Tyrant"", since the whole story involves his efforts to overthrow and slay the magic-ring-possessing usurper of Baristan.

Misleading titles aside, the story just C R A W L S, despite the amusing antics of the good sorcerer and some charming special effects.  Even the game Guy Williams seems bored, apart from the rousing climax: a five-minute tower ascent and duel with scimitars.

I love Guy Williams in the Disney Zorro TV series -- he's simply splendid there -- but this Sinbad is just plain bad.  Do yourself a favor and save your pennies for much-superior versions such as ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"", ""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"", and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s wonderful ""Sinbad the Sailor"".  Even Kerwin Matthew's ""Jack the Giant Killer"" is much better, if you like old-style special effects and fairy-tale type stories.  The first half-hour alone is worth the price of admission.",1356566400,2,1628,4.996296296296296
468682,3,6302478928,"I really love Sinbad movies they're full of excitement great story telling and fantasy. This one though was a little disappointing to say the least. What makes this one so bad is the special effects. There also is some pretty lame acting on this film. Guy Williams is a pretty decent Sinbad,but the rest of the actors were just short of terrible. I'm glad I bought the movie to see it for myself,but not completely happy with it. The movie is very clear and very colorful so I don't have any complaints in that department. I would only recommend this movie to a Sinbad completist, for anyone else, you might want to pass on this one.",1345161600,,633,4.4655172413793105
468743,1,6302478928,What can I say? A truly sad movie. Special effects suck out loud. The acting is just as bad. Why oh why did I spend good money on this P.O.S. Even Eye Of The Tiger blows this away. The animated Sinbad Of The Seven Seas is leaps and bounds better than this crap. Avoid this movie at all costs unless it's for a 5 year old.,1339632000,,321,3.878787878787879

There is nothing wrong with this movie because it has a definite Sinbad tale to tell with Guy Williams playing strong in the lead. There are some fine ideas involving a magical side drinking magician who is under a tyrants curse, and later helps Sinbad accomplish his quest to save the life of a condemned princess.
This movie is actually in a class all its own, and does not try to overshadow the great effects of cinema. What it has is true high spirited heart, fine costumes, and outrageous monsters to give the imagination all it needs.

468775,3,6302478928,"Finally, Captain Sindbad now exists in the fairer medium.  It still contains special effects that are just short of special - but they're digitally enhanced, much clearer, and in Widescreen!  This is one of those fun, innocent movies, that contains a wild romp to stamp out evil - if your kids haven't seen it, they should.  The soundtrack evolves around Borodin's magnificent ""Stranger in Paradise"" - highly appropriate for this film.  Casting is wonderful with Guy Williams of ""Zorro"" and ""Lost in Space"" fame taking on the evil El Karim, played by Pedro Armendariz, Sr.  Beautiful Heidi Bruhl is cast as Sindbad's love interest and Abraham Sofaer is cast as the magician, Galgo.

TRIVIA: If you look really closely, you'll find an actor who somehow got lost in Europe during the early 60's and managed to make an appearance in almost every film made there during that period, including - ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""The 300 Spartans"", and an uncredited role in ""The Longest Day"" - that actor is John Crawford.

TRIVIA:  Byron Haskin, who directed this film, and actor Abraham Sofaer would work together the following year (1964) on an episode of The Outer Limits also staring Robert Culp and Arlene Martel - written by Harlan Ellison - ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" - probably one of the finest science fiction episodes ever made.",1243728000,3,1329,4.875555555555556

It is a total shame and a waste of good quality, although very differect from the other Harryhausen Sinbads, family entertainment in the history of the one screen movie theaters, and some plays in the early days of television, that the studios have left it to the waste side. Please, with all your resources and technoloy, if there is a copyright problem, please fix it, and if there's another problem, please fix that also. This movie is definitely worth the modern price of a quality dvd with perhaps Sinbad cartoon extras to add meat to the package.

468778,5,6302478928,"First let me say 'I never saw a Sindbad the Sailor movie I didn't like.'.

So lets' get to it--just a short review.

PROS:

  1.  It's a Sindbad move...that's a star right there.

  2.  Look at the face of his crew when they speak to him--

  they can actually act.

  3.  The cutie is a cutie,though I did not like the sound of her

  voice very well it passes.

  4.  Special effects--force scale ok, mechanical rooks--who cares

  Models ok.

  5.  Story idea and story line--five stars.  A standard girl in

  trouble, obducted by the bad guy, good guy (sorry for the pun}

  comes ashore and spots the trouble ""well, that's it for him!""

  and he goes after the bad guy with a sword.

  PS  A side note here--the cutie.  I don't give stars for cuties

  being cuties but listen to this short story.  You remember

  the group of females who cornered the woman in Forbidden Planet?

  They ask her how she keep her dress from riding up when she

  bent over and woman answered ""Pins and safety pins--you could see

  the blood running down my legs....""  Well, another group related

  to that group of girls did a Hollywood search for 'any' movie

  showing a girl being stripped down to her skin who showed any

  dignity what-so-ever.  The cutie in Captain Sindbad was stripped

  and shrunk to the size of a bird--she won that award.

  I have closely watched that scene and I agree, that cutie is the

  only female in all moviedom to take it all off for the cause

  with complete dignity.  Look at her pose...such beauty.

  7:  Guy Williams stars as Captain Sindbad; thats' a star.

  8:  Heck...even the bad guy could act--watch him close.

  9:  The dream sequince is great--even the music.  I guess this is

  the kind of dream girls have for their wedding night, if so

  then I can understand why they used to wait all their life

  for their own white knight.

  10: The arena scene:  It couldn't have gotten much better.  Sindbad

  strolls out to the cheering of the crowds calling his name andthe

  'hero' music is right on target.  Yes sir, in those old movies

  they knew how to treat the hero...there wasn't any doubt Sindbad

  was the hero.  Not since the closing scenes of Star Wars have

  I seen it done like that.  Even the low life captain of the guard

  seemed to have a moment or two of remorse because of what Sindbad

  was about to face--alone--unarmed--and its invisible.  He even

  says when asked what it was ""...It is better you do not know..."".

  I think had I been that guard captain I would have given him

  my sword.

  11. All in all, I love this movie from the good ol'days of hero's.

  The hero is a good 'guy', the cutie is a cutie and good girl.

  There is a bad man needing dispatched--lets go get him!

CONS:

  1.  It could have used another five million in production.

So there it all is:  To Sindbad the Sailor, Guy Williams, ""Zorro"" and

all the good cuties (even though I don't drink) for all you do...this

Buds' for you!",1175990400,,2986,4.354838709677419
468779,4,6302478928,"Don't even compare this flick with any of the Ray Harryhausen special effect movies, because it won't work. And I didnt, when I first saw this, a long time ago. And I am very picky with Sci-fi movies.
Sci-fi movies do not garner a five star rating with magnificent special effects, if the storyline is uninvolving. Fortunitely for this movie, it gives Mr. Guy Williams, of Lost In Space TV series, to brush up on his handling of making the ridiculous, seem real. Even threatening.
You know you're in trouble with the believable special effects when the giant like buzzards hover over Sinbad's ship, to drop boulders, and you see mechanical crow feet. But the storyline believes in itself, and makes no excuses for the special effects team production. It moves briskly, with no apologies. Even the obvious scene where the magicians head is made to spin on his shoulders by the uncaring ruler's manipulative magic ring, is an obvious look at bad special effects. But who cares, again the story continues on in spite of itself, and moves on with the plot. That scene, by the way, made me laugh. . .I liked the guy who played Galgo. A ""nipping on the side"" magician confidant.
The final scenes where the exploring men seek the hidden heart above the tower, go through a very colorful, yet still phony swamp. Again, this works for the movie, but it stays on the same continuity. By the time you get to the several headed dragon, get over it! It's the icing on the cake of pure fakery, but the actors go along with it as if the seriousness does indeed exist. That's what makes this movie a magical journey for Captain Sindbad. (They need to really consider DVD availabilty).",1171065600,,1668,4.638513513513513
468780,3,6302478928,"This movie, made on a cheap budget, is perhaps one of the most colorful movies ever made.

I saw this movie 24 times in afternoons (Kent theatre, Saturday prison for kids, 6 hours of movies to keep them off the streets) over a few years from about 1964 to 1966. It is a kid's movie, no doubt. Therefore all the talk about bad special effects, etc. don't really register because as a child I never noticed them as much as just watching the action. I believe today's kids are more aware, but in the 60's a movie of this type was very successful as a Saturday matinee lead. Guy Williams role as Captain Sindbad is actually very good. He should have been given more opportunity than ""Lost in Space"" and ""Zorro"" because I think he had talent. We know El Karim, Pedro Armendariz, was a bigger actor, involved in of all things, a memorable role before his death in ""From Russia With Love"" as Bond's contact in Turkey. But he also does well as an evil leader here. The plot is the classic quest. But what really stands out are two things. One is when Sindbad is condemmed to fight in the arena in what turns out to be the invisible beast from ""Forbidden Planet"" , scary, that one! The other is the incredible dream sequence provided by Abraham Sofaer that turns the tables on reality. These two sequences are worth the price of admission (in my case in '63, 25 cents). So, don't go modern and down this movie because of cheap special effects. Nearly all kid's movies back then were just as cheap, badly plotted and acted but not as colorful! Yes, it isn't Harryhausen, but it IS something unique about a period not well covered.",1170547200,,1853,4.485207100591716
468781,3,6302478928,"Here's one for the books.  With wonderful character actors like Guy ""Zorro"" Williams, new-comer Heidi Bruhl, and the legendary Pedro Armendariz - who despite cancer, provided a stellar performance as the evil El Karim, even Abraham Sofaer's magician character can't pull this rabbit entirely out of the hat.  The storyline is very good and the film score is memorable.

With Byron Haskin at the helm, I'm certain that there were great expectations for this picture.  It came out at roughly the same time as ""Jason and the Argonauts"" - a Schneer/Harryhausen classic, yet the two movies are set apart vastly by special effects, i.e. budget.  Simply look away when the wire-guided alligators attack the hapless crew as they search for El Karim's heart that is locked away in a tower.  Tie a pillow to your head when you see the ""hydra-like"" Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon that guards the tower so you don't bat your head against the floor.  DO NOT compare this particular special effect to the astonishing hydra in ""Jason and the Argonauts"". Look for actor John Crawford as he runs around in the same sandals he wore in many similar genre movies in the early sixties - like ""The 300 Spartans"" - and yes, ""Jason and the Argonauts"".

As a kid, I really liked this movie.  It's fun to watch regardless of the special effects.  Guy Williams was the best Sindbad.  Now, it's time to see this on DVD!",1157328000,,1399,4.739669421487603
