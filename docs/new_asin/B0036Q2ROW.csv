8390136,4,B0036Q2ROW,"Great advanced pole dancing techniques. Great for a 2 1/1 or 3rd year student. This is by a stripper for strippers, the DVD came out in 2003, before the big boom in pole dancing at home, for exercise. If you're offended by a topless teacher, this isn't for you. If you are inspired by climbing and doing splits on the pole in 10"" heels, then this is for you.",1443052800,,358,4.202898550724638
8390137,4,B0036Q2ROW,We bought this with the beginners video.  It is advanced goes kind of fast.  You have to know the basics before you get started.,1301270400,,128,4.291666666666667
8390138,1,B0036Q2ROW,"I just bought this DVD along with two others; Leigh Ann's Advanced Pole Dance Workout and Sedusa Studios Advanced Pole Dancing.  This one was by far the worst.  The dancer is topless, pierced, and tattooed all over in a lot of the scenes, a man is narrating it, and it keeps skipping from advanced to beginning to advanced to intermediate.  It's just not good.  Leigh Ann's was must easier to follow and worth the extra cost.",1301011200,4,425,4.552631578947368
