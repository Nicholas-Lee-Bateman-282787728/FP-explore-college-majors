8140020,5,B000HJFS1U,"This is an excellent Praise DVD.  It reminds us to Praise God on the Mountain as well as in the Valley experience.  In fact, Praise is how we come out of our valley experiences with peace and comfort.

This DVD is well worth the purchase.  I have already purchased 2 and plan to purchase more as gifts.
