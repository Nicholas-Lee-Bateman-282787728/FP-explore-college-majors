Every so often, I go to a movie that would probably seem like an odd choice for someone who loves films. When I tell others about the film I have recently subjected myself to, their immediate response is ""You saw that?"" I frequently go to silly action films because I enjoy watching the preposterous stunts and action scenes the filmmakers come up with. Usually. Most of the time, these films aren't any good. But I also feel like you need to see the bad in order to fully appreciate the good.

And then there are films like ""Crank - High Voltage"". I remember actually enjoying ""Crank"" because is was an incredibly fast-paced film (most of the story is revealed in grunts as Jason Statham's Chev Chellos barrels through the story) and was strangely ""off"". All of the characters were more bad than good and everyone was looking out for himself.

But now, after seeing ""High Voltage"", I am wondering if I am remembering the first film too fondly.

Picking up where the last film ended, literally, we watch as Chev drops out of a plane and hits a car on a Los Angeles street. The guy he was fighting with lands on the pavement nearby, dead. Chev is still alive, but barely. Then a van pulls up and a bunch of Chinese gang members pull Chev inside. Later, he wakes up in a brothel with Chinese doctors standing around him, admiring their handiwork. They have removed his heart and replaced it with an artificial model that runs on a battery, which they have conveniently strapped, to his chest. He makes an escape and soon learns he needs to constantly re-charge the battery, so he applies jumper cables and the like to his tongue. But he also wants to find the Chinese gang leader who stole his heart and begins to battle his way through the streets, following leads and working towards his goal. A group of Latino gang members are also on the hunt. And Chev runs into (Amy Smart) who is working at a strip club. She rejoins him for part of the ride.

""High Voltage"" is such a waste of time I find it difficult to adequately explain why.

And I really am beginning to wonder what I found so 'fun' in the first film.

In ""High Voltage"", the filmmakers take no time to explain who Chev is, so I guess they are assuming only people who have seen the first entry will spend any money to see this second installment in the saga of Chelios. Honestly, I forget what Chev is, so I didn't have a clue as I sat there watching Statham careen through one set of bad guys after another.

Because Statham is always moving, it is all but impossible for him to do anything but grunt or shout. When his new artificial heart begins to slow down, he pauses, and looks groggy for a few seconds until he spots some new source of electrical current.

Amy Smart appears for about twenty minutes, entering the story on the weakest of pretenses, hanging on Chev's arm as he tries to outrun the current crop of bad guys and then disappears, popping up again for no specific reason.

Clifton Collins Jr. (""Capote"", ""Sunshine Cleaning"") pops up at the end of the film in a role that is such a ludicrous caricature I am surprised we haven't heard from any Latino Rights groups. But maybe they are doing the smart thing and standing by the sidelines, letting this film die a quick death. If they were to protest, they would only bring attention to this film and lengthen the life of this piece of trash.

Dwight Yoakam returns as Chev's friend, a disgraced doctor who helps Chev navigate the treacherous waters of his newest ailment. His character is depraved and clearly enjoys his newfound status as an outcast of society. In ""High Voltage"", he spends much of his time licking, touching or caressing the near naked buttocks of an African American prostitute.

David Carradine also makes an appearance as a Chinese gang boss. Honestly, his appearance is more laughable than anything else as he is made up to look like his character from ""Kung Fu"" but as a senior citizen.

Just rehashing all of this has left a bad taste in my mouth.

Consider yourself warned.",1241308800,5,4037,4.512328767123288
3793623,5,B001TRDQIQ,"Although I have never been high or drunk before, this movie made me feel like I was stoned while watching an action film, I don't really know how to explain that, but it was an awesome feeling. I also thought it was extremely hilarious and it was a really good sequel. After three months, Chev Chelios is back, and tries to find his heart before he dies. Doc Miles tells him that the Chinese gave him an AbioCor Artificial heart, and he must keep it charged, or he will die. He has jumper cables helping him, rubbing up against an old woman, makin' sweet love to his girlfriend, Eve on a horse race track, and grabbing electric wires. I highly recommend CRANK: HIGH VOLTAGE!!!",1240617600,,676,4.459677419354839
3793624,5,B001TRDQIQ,"I just got back from seeing this awesome movie, and I must say it made the great guy's night out. I remember seeing the first movie on DVD and thinking it was good but not amazing, yet seeing the trailer I was pumped for this movie. Anyways tonight me dad and I decided to go see this movie, and boy what a great movie this is. It's the ultimate guy flick for sure.

Taking place 10 minutes after the first movie, Chev Chellios, the guy who died in the first movie, actually didn't die. You'd be amazed the distance he fell and lived. Anyways, he is taken to the chinatown hospital, where his heart is replaced with a battery-powered artificial heart, meaning he has very limited time to keep himself energized. And he has the most uncanny ways of keeping himself jolted, including wearing a doggy collar, grabbing multiple high voltage boxes, and so much more.

This is a GUYS movie, so a lot of women will be tuned off. Don't expect Shakespeare here, this movie is just a good round of action-packed fun. This has lots of action, and boobs, even a hilarious sex scene. There's LOTS of blood and gore in the film, all which comes as expected. The movie is gorier than the first for sure. Oh and the Chevzilla scene was HILARIOUS!

And in general, this is just a great movie. If you loved the first, see this without a doubt.",1240531200,4,1325,4.4
3793625,4,B001TRDQIQ,"Like a car crash - in this case something like an oil tanker colliding with a school bus full of baby kittens - Crank: High Voltage is disturbing to an intense degree, yet it's difficult to look away. Topping its predecessor in every manner of excessive vulgarities, Crank's acknowledgment and subsequent self-reflective mockery of its own escapist anti-realism produces a highly engaging exercise in both parody and hurdling over the boundaries of good taste. Wholesome entertainment this is not. But it's entertainment nonetheless.

For relentlessly revenge-driven and eternally enraged hitman Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), not even death could slow him down. After being poisoned, beaten, shot, and falling several thousand feet onto unforgiving pavement, Chelios is alive and well, save for having his indestructible heart stolen by Chinese mobsters and replaced with a mechanical one. Now forced to re-energize his ticker with bursts of electricity at frequent intervals, the bitter killer must hunt down his assailants while simultaneously fending off nearly limitless enemies from his past. On his side is vitriolic girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart), maniacal ex-doctor Miles (Dwight Yoakum), spastic ally Venus (Efren Ramirez) and an unquenchable thirst for vengeance.

Crank: High Voltage finally recognizes the shortcomings of the original and uses them to its advantage. Realizing that an attempt at serious hardcore action gave way to unrealistic, hyper-stylized, implausibly frenetic chaos and unintentional humor allows High Voltage to break free from its restraints and fully embrace the over-the-top humor that Crank reservedly craved. The utter nonsense that surrounds this fast-paced sequel that refuses to take itself seriously oozes with bloodthirsty violence, overdoses of risqu sex in very public places and crazily callous cursing.

""Fatal"" means nothing to the seemingly invincible Chelios or to the wide assortment of oddballs that frequent his odyssey. It's crude, cruel, coarse, and off-color and perhaps the best brainless escapism to bombard the action film scene in much too long. From the opening scene in which Vang smugly flicks cigarette ashes onto Chev's exposed ""strawberry tart"" during open-heart surgery, to Doc Miles' reminiscing about the loss of a medical license due to his wife's failed vaginal rejuvenation procedure in the basement, to Venus' untimely full body Tourette Syndrome attacks, Crank: High Voltage quadruples the action, fatalities, old lady defilement, random nudity, and unbelievably twisted villains, and even has time to throw in a John Woo homage or two and opera music for good measure. Just watching this film will get you high.

3793627,4,B001TRDQIQ,"How much abuse can one body take? When we last left Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), he had fallen from a helicopter, bounced off a car, and landed on a street in the middle of Los Angeles. And this was after being injected with a toxin that stopped the production of adrenaline. Now he finds himself in the middle of an operating room, his still-beating heart removed from his chest and replaced with an artificial version that's hooked up to a battery. When the battery gets destroyed, he's left with only an implanted backup generator, and in order for that to keep working, he must keep himself electrically charged. Sometimes, that involves sticking his finger into a car socket. At other times, that involves clamping jumper cables to his nipple and tongue, at which point the person behind the wheel hits the accelerator.

The original ""Crank"" was shameless, high octane fun, and so is ""Crank: High Voltage,"" a film that doesn't know the meaning of the word ""excessive."" There's not a trace of humility to be found in any one of its ninety-six minutes. It's an unabashedly crude crime caper that uses four-letter dialogue as if being paid by the letter. It's an in-your-face assault on the senses, a hyperactive video game that never makes use of the pause button. Normally, these would be the hallmarks of a God-awful film, but in this case, they're the hallmarks of a stylish thrill ride that's just as funny as it is shocking. It's a movie so audacious in its insanity that I pretty much have to recommend it; it may not be the most edifying thing you'll ever see, but it certainly will be the most unforgettable hour-and-a-half you've had all spring.

The story: An Asian gangster named Johnny Vang (Art Hsu) is somewhere in Los Angeles with Chelios' heart, which is said to be indestructible and therefore perfect for harvesting. Chelios, with only a weakly powered artificial heart to work with, goes on a frantic search, stopping every so often to recharge. Along the way, he meets a number of ... interesting people. There's his old flame, Eve (Amy Smart), who now works as a stripper. There's a Chinese prostitute named Ria (Ling Bai), who clings to Chelios like a dog in heat and uses language that would make a sailor blush. There's Venus (Efren Ramirez), who's on a mission to avenge the death of his twin brother, Kaylo. Chelios has an occasional phone conversation with Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), who was once a heart surgeon before losing his license.

The movie is filled with unbelievable moments, but there are three in particular so priceless that I have to describe them. The first takes place at Hollywood Park, where a horse race is being held. Miles tells Chelios that, in a pinch, skin to skin friction will generate enough static electricity to keep his battery going. When Eve learns of this, she and Chelios begin creating their own ""friction""--in the middle of the racing track to a cheering crowd of thousands. The second takes place in a power grid. Chelios and Vang start fighting, at which point the scene turns into a cheesy Asian monster movie, complete with unconvincing miniatures and makeup effects. The third is a strange flashback sequence revealing Chelios as a child (Billy Unger). He and his mother are on a talk show discussing why he became such a juvenile delinquent.

None of this has any real bearing on the story; they're nothing more than excuses for the movie to be ill-mannered and/or goofy. There are, of course, many other instances of these extremes, but they're all so over the top that I probably wouldn't be able to describe them anyway.

I leave it to you to see what happens at the end. Let it suffice to say that the shot before the end credits perfectly sums up everything the filmmakers set out to do. It would not be enough to say that this movie is bizarre; it's so outlandish that it pretty much defies the conventions of genre. Comparisons can be made to ""Shoot `Em Up,"" Michael Davis' no-holds-barred, brilliantly original action film from 2007 that made use of stylized violence and a delightfully sick sense of humor. Both films also feature a British leading man. This leads me to why ""Shoot `Em Up"" is the more successful film: Clive Owen gave us a performance we hadn't seen him give before. Jason Statham, on the other hand, has starred almost exclusively in extreme action films, so there's very little he can do to surprise us.

Nevertheless, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this movie, and it has everything to do with how far it goes. There's a difference between a movie that goes too far and a movie like ""Crank: High Voltage""--the latter goes so far, it actually surpasses offensiveness and becomes entertaining. This is cinematic decadence at its most potent, an unbridled foray into the mind-numbing depths of action, comedy, and yes, even sex. One of the earliest cues is given by John de Lancie, who plays a TV anchorman; he describes the events of the first film as implausible. No, he doesn't just say the word. He pauses momentarily before accenting the word, as if to let the audience know that they're in store for yet another round of sheer lunacy. The writing/directing team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor could have made a tamer film, I suppose, but like Chev Chelios, they're hearts just weren't in it.",1240358400,25,5314,4.733261339092873

3793629,5,B001TRDQIQ,"Crank 2: High Voltage

For those that did not see the first one i will warn you. this is not for someone that is looking for a deep plot with a thick story line and developing characters. the plot is Chev Chelios (statham) had his heart taken from his body by the chinese and replaced by a fake battery powerd heart. to keep himself alive he has to electroffy his body to charge the battery to keep his heart running or he will die. so Chelios has to fine his heart to get it put back in his body by killing everyone that took it from him. the plot does not get much better then that, but this is what makes this movie what it is. Crank was not made to have a deep plot it was made to be stait forward and fun.

For fans of the first one, this one is almost identical. Amy Smart comes back as Eve, Chelios's girlfriend from the first movie. The chemistry between the two in this one is a lot hotter then before. and as you would suspect there is alot more gratuitous nudity, violence and gore.

For parents, this earns a hardcore R rating. there is full frontal female nudity and you see Stathams butt a few times. there is also extremely simulated Sex, the F word is also used well over 100 times throught the movie. there is also alot of violence, shooting and killing of people. if you are not sure if your kid should see this, do not show it to them, this is every bad part of a R rated movie rolled into an Hr and a half.

If you have not seen the first one i would recomend to rent it before you see two, though Crank 2 is very entertaining to watch on its own, if you have seen the first one you cna catch all the little inside joke and returning themes from the first one. Over all if you are over 17 and you want to watch something that is going to be very entertaining see this moive. If you are looking for something that after you watch it you want to change your life forever this is not you film, unless you are a retired asassin trying to get your heart back from the Chinese.",1240185600,2,1991,4.0585241730279895
3793630,3,B001TRDQIQ,"I enjoyed how unique the first Crank film was and this sequel is even more wild, but I liked it a lot less. Crank: High Voltage is a roller coaster ride that last 85 minutes and features some really gross scenes. For example, a guy getting a shotgun rammed up his rear end isn't even in the top three weird moments in this flick. There was one scene where a guy had to punish himself for letting his boss down, which I had to turn my head and look away (I can't remember the last time I did that). There is almost zero realism here, much like the original, only multiplied by a hundred. Jason Statham is the main action star in the business right now and he is pretty good at what he does. He went all out here and I'm sure he has nothing but bruises and a nice paycheck to show for it. The large supporting cast was better than average and Amy Smart was especially yummy. If you liked Crank (2006) you will probably enjoy this one well enough, but I think they should put this series to rest. Judging by the ending during the credits, I'm sure we can expect Crank 3-D: Zombie Chev in the near future.",1240012800,3,1101,4.173708920187793

Don't get me wrong, I like Jason Statham, but I wasn't expecting an Oscar contender, if you know what I mean.  Something maybe like The Transporter...some explosions, a car chase or two, done.

This movie is The Transporter turned up to 11...and hooked up to a 700 foot tall Van De Graff generator which has just been struck by lightning shooting out of Zeus' eyeballs while he is riding a 700hp lawn mower through Chernobyl during a full moon...on fast forward.

Feed someone you would describe as a, ""spaz"" high grade crank and asked them to write a series of movie scenes that are, ""awesome"".  They don't need to be related in any way.  Voila!  Crank 2 is born.  It's explosions, and car chases, and strippers, and the asian mafia, and UFC fighter Keith Jardine, and porn star strikes, and gun fights, and face tattoos, and numchucks, and old ladies saying ""the S word"" on the news, and lusty psychiatrists...should I keep listing?  Because that list covers a total of like 5 minutes of screen time.  Literally EVERYTHING happens in this movie.

I've never seen anything like it.  Imagine how many times you think a director could cut during a 10 second long action sequence.  Now quadruple that and have a naked stripper spray it with lighter fluid, light it on fire, and jump a car over it.

This is Bevis and Butthead's favorite movie, but not in a good way.  Imagine if Bevis and Butthead were real kids that you actually went to high school with and suddenly it wasn't so funny anymore and was actually kind of sad...this is the movie they watch over and over again.

Maybe this is making it sound like you should watch this movie, like watching a car crash.  You shouldn't, though.  It's not just a fun action movie, it's, ""what the hell is this, is my TV broken?""

If you pay attention to all the situations and scenes - they are absolutely hilarious (perhaps, with a dark sense of humor).  This movie has a very witty plot for a comedy and great acting, pace, cutting, music, etc.  If I am not mistaken, this is the first Action Comedy Mr. Statham has done - a very GOOD one.  Reminds me of Arnie's action comedies of the 90-s.  For a reference, there is a movie Shoot 'em Up (with Clive Owen and Monica Bellucci):  clearly made as a comedy, but acted so very ""serious"" that even accelerates the comedy quality of the movie.  I only wish that Jason Statham lifts up to his full comedy action hero potential and make more of similar spectacular films.  Eagerly awaiting...

3793793,3,B001TRDQIQ,"The redeeming factors of this film is that it stared Jason Statham and that it was filled with action, chases, shootings, fist fights, and the like, but the story is strange and it is filled with unnecessary pornography and indecent language. The plot is that Stratham's heart was stolen by a 110 year old Chinese gang leader who needs the heart of a strong man to keep on living. Stratham is captured, operated upon, and given a replacement mechanical heart that needs to be energized frequently. Stratham goes in search to reacquire his heart and needs to reenergize himself from time to time, indeed frequently. The film shows humorous ways that he does so. The film ends in a way that suggests that this second film on the subject will be continued with a third, which will not be to the liking of many viewers.",1421884800,,815,4.627586206896551

I must say Statham gets unfairly criticized for not being a good actor, that he is only an action guy. I totally disagree. Watch some of his other films, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Bank Job, Snatch and many others. He has the acting chops to go along with his badass persona.

Amazon sent me another copy the next day, which was surprising, and that one didn't work either; so that was returned and Amazon gave me my money back. which is great, but it would be even better if they stopped selling this blu-ray movie or put a warning on the page about it, seeing they've known about the problem for sometime.

3793907,4,B001TRDQIQ,"I know it's farfetched but just in case my heart ever is ripped out of my chest and replaced with a battery-powered mechanical pump, I am furiously taking notes as I watch this sequel. I admit that whoever came up with this screenplay had to have been sipping from the goofy juice, the narrative is that loopy. I could've sworn there was no way to resurrect rugged paid assassin Chev Chelios after his mile-long plummet from helicopter to unforgiving terra firma, but survive he improbably did. CRANK 2: HIGH VOLTAGE demonstrates the how. Also, one peek at the film title should present a quick clue that this movie isn't about Jason Statham's character knitting in a rocking chair all the live-long day. Jason Statham is a trooper, to take on some of the insane stuff he's asked to do here.

CRANK 2 picks up moments after the first film leaves off. We revisit Chev Chelios' seemingly fatal plunge from that helicopter in downtown Los Angeles, his harsh caroming off a car roof and face planting onto cement - that's how CRANK ended it. But, in the sequel, seconds later, Triad hoods pull up and spatula Chev Chelios off the pavement. Three months elapse during which Chelios undergoes massive surgery, and it's at this stage that his highly coveted heart is removed and the Avicor Artificial Heart System - basically a battery-powered artificial pump - is implanted into his chest cavity. Upon learning that there are plans to harvest even more organs from his body, a frantic Chelios escapes captivity and begins his odd quest to reclaim his heart. His target is Johnny Vang, him what carries around a suspicious ice cooler. But Chev has to go thru a gauntlet of Triad goons and Mexican mobsters, overzealous cops and incensed porn stars on strike (look for real-life porn stars Ron Jeremy and Jenna Haze in this throng screaming out slogans like ""No dough, no blow.""). Our heartless hitman also finds himself fending off the unwanted attentions of a wacked-out Asian prostitute (Bai Ling). For now, Chev Chelios has to make do with the artificial pump, and what sucks is that he has to keep electrically charging the pump's battery. At least long enough for him to retrieve his ""strawberry tart"" (which is cockney slang for ""heart"").

And that's the film's primary hook, really, Chelios unearthing all manner of messed-up ways to keep the pump device topped up. It's crazy how he applies jumper cables and tasers on himself. In one instance, he even puts on an elecric dog collar and continually shocks himself. But maybe the funniest bit is when Chelios is at a horse-racing track and begins to rub himself against complete strangers, trying to muster static electricity. This sequence leads to a reprise of a famous crowd-pleasing scene from the first film.

CRANK 2 is gleefully unapologetic about its political incorrectness. It flaunts it, actually. CRANK 2 churns out elements of satire, crassness, manic brutality, and even casual racism. It for sure is damn irreverent and over-the-top and so offbeat even beatniks are thrown off. It's shot frenetically, with a hyper-realistic sensibility in mind, and it may take a bit of time before you acclimate to the disorienting camera movements. Dwight Yoakam and Amy Smart reprise their roles, only it's disappointing that Amy Smart's character Eve has been dumbed down and trivialized even more. Efren Ramirez is also back but this time he plays the brother of his character from the first movie, and maybe it's wrong to laugh at the guy's disability but when the writers saddle a character with something called full body tourettes, hey, I'll play along and willingly laugh on cue. CRANK 2 ventures into What-the-F territory. You'll be up to your ears in sudden claymation figures, disembodied talking heads, and a jarringly inserted talk show segment. Again, roll with the punches. Tasteless and offensive and lewd, ridiculously violent and pretty much certifiable, this movie marches to the beat of its own drummer. It's even more absurd than the first CRANK. And, no, it's probably not for everyone. Me, though, I laughed like a mother.",1325376000,2,4096,4.933333333333334

If that's what you want, this is the movie for you to get. If you're looking for a masterpiece movie with a serious story, step away now!

(Possible spoilers for the first 5 minutes of the movie (including the end of Crank 1))

The first movie ends with Statham falling out of a helicopter and smacking the concrete below, and that's just where this one begins (literally!) - being Crank, he lives and just gets up to walk away from it. He's quickly taken away to have his heart removed to be implanted into someone else (if he can live through everything in the first film, it's gotta be something amazing!). With his heart gone, he's living off a very-poor-quality artificial one.. with a low battery which he constantly needs to power (and as you can imagine, that includes all sorts of nonsense methods) - he goes on a search to get his heart back. While all this seems crazy, this is just the first 5 minutes - along the way he runs into every odd person you can imagine. If this seems like the stupidest movie you've ever heard, stop reading now! If you're interested in that much, I think you'll enjoy the movie. It's a crazy ride, but an entertaining one (definitely not for kids).

The blu-ray is one of the best looking ones I've seen. I believe it was filmed with the RED cameras, and has a very sharp image throughout. This makes a wonderful demo piece for a nice HDTV!

""Crank 2: High Voltage"" plays like a Laz Buhrmann production on crack.  This sequel to the 2006 original is one of those frantic, postmodern action pictures, replete with snarky dialogue, cartoonish - though highly graphic - violence, and cut-and-paste visuals.

Jason Statham returns as the reformed hit man who has his heart literally ripped out of his chest by a passel of armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and replaced with a mechanical one.  Stratham races against the clock searching for his original ticker before the replacement runs out of juice.

As conceived and executed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, ""Crank 2"" might have had the makings of a genuine cult classic were it not trying so ridiculously hard to impress us.  As it is, the frenetic pacing, cuisinart-style editing, and migraine-inducing visuals wind up merely wearing us out in the end.",1276992000,,866,5.1063829787234045

I loved the first Crank and the first time I saw this sequel was disappointed. But watching the two back to back yesterday made me realize that Crank:High Voltage was simply one-upping the first in anarchic fashion, and seen from that perspective, and with all expectations turned off, this is one weird, wild flick.

Neveldine and Taylor shoot in HD and this blu-ray disc is amazing, state of the art like their other movies. And that crispness is well-used by the insane shots and colorful weirdness here, as well as some nicely washed out scenes with flat color palettes that contrast nicely. If you like eye candy, you'll love this. And if you like being surprised, step right up.

The story makes zero effort at seriousness; the word ""implausible"" is mentioned early on and is a good watchword for C:HV. Nothing here is meant to be taken seriously, merely to be entertaining. Crank's silly Chinatown scene is echoed by a horse race version, a sign that N/T are here purely for the laughs and the action. And Amy Smart delevers a whole new side of raunchy goofiness to her character this time around.

While not as non-stop as Crank, HV does have more than its share of action, and the whole recharge theme is played for laughs pretty well, especially as Statham gives his all to those shots. His face is very funny at times, and this must be his most humorous turn to date.

Too wild and weird for some, no doubt, this movie will be perfect eye candy/brainfreeze for others. If you like Statham, Smart, the craziness and visual clarity of N/T, and/or general insanity, then you'll enjoy this silly ride.",1273968000,,1619,4.666666666666667
3793931,5,B001TRDQIQ,"This movie made me feel like I was on some sort of drug induced high for an hour and a half. It's relentless in how aggressive it is and does not shy away from delineating from its core plot in order to explore some tangential themes.

It is not a movie meant to educate, influence, or impact anyone more than just providing a deep dive into how chaotic an experience can be. Chev Chelios I think will go down in movie history as a character that lives beyond the screen itself. He embodies what many wish to be; he is indestructible, unwieldy, intelligent (though not in the formal sense, one can see how he is able to interpret situations and act accordingly), and incredibly potent at what he does. He is not the kind of character that can take a place in a comprehensive story, rather, his place is in these short sprint-type tales where the premise and outcome can easily be extrapolated, allowing for the actual journey to have free reign.

If he is not already there, Jason Statham is on his way to becoming the premiere action star. He has a body type that does not try to overplay his brute strength. It allows for him not only to be powerful, but incredibly fast and agile as well. His facial expressions convey the rebellious nature of his character perfectly; he does not ever waver in his determination and would rather die than pull a punch.

I would love for Crank to turn into a series of movies, as I believe they offer not only a playground for the director to explore what this character can do, but also a brief ride for moviegoers to enjoy and use to raise their heart rates a bit.

I understand why this movie does not have a higher rating, as it can never appeal to a big portion of the general population, but I think one should look at it in a different light. My opinions do often vary from public opinion on many movies, but I believe it is mostly due to what I expect to see.",1272153600,,1903,4.337078651685394
3793932,5,B001TRDQIQ,Crank 2 is def. a step up from Crank. Quite possibly the BEST sequel ever. Period. Not to be taken seriously but enjoyed as a true Hollywood action and adventure movie.

3793933,3,B001TRDQIQ,"Crank 2 is like watching a Tony Scott film on speed.  It tries to be the craziest non-stop action B-movie to end all B-movies. But therein lies the problem - it feels so video game-ish that we lose all feeling for the character Chev.  Jason Statham is getting old in these kinds of films and has become a genre in himself.

Here's why I didn't like it: way too frenetic, seizure inducing edits and too many over-the-top moments.  It feels like the filmmakers are taking your head and bashing it against the wall time after time.  There's no letting up and no respite.  The funny parts are good but the first Crank was way better.  Somehow, the filmmakers decided to up the ante this time round by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink and in doing so, created a really self-indulgent cult film.  Casting wise, Dwight Yoakam is great as Doc, and David Carradine appears in one of his last roles as a triad godfather.

The original Crank was well done but this sequel overstays its welcome.  Some restraint might have worked in its favor.

PS - the real achievement of the film is that it was shot on prosumer digital cameras.  Inspiring technical choice with great results, but this alone doesn't make the film.  Still, worth checking out if you're a cinematography buff.",1269907200,,1282,4.644444444444445
3793934,5,B001TRDQIQ,"Ok, maybe not on the calibre of the Academy Awards, but this film too often gets subjegated to the ""crap"" category.  To that, I cry foul. If you cannot suspend disbelief or you lack a wild imagination, then my review cannot help you.  Please move along.

This film is an amazing experiment in cinema techniques, story telling, and plain old exploitation.  This is THE film America needs. Why?

It's brutal.  And not just rough and tumble bvrutal.  No. It's brutal beyond belief.  I had to rewind the ""sushi"" scene at least 4 or 5 times just to make sure I actually was seeing what was going on. Then, some guy cuts his own nipples off.  Ever wonder what happens if a stripper gets shot in her boob job?  Wonder no more.

It's offensive.  Besides the racial and sexual stereotypes, it's as though everyone in LA is scum. The cops, the gangsters, the old ladies.  Everyone.  (I've heard that's the case, but I've never been there so I can't confirm.  but it seems like fun.)  And Bai ling is great as the kooky prostitue that murders the English language.  Yes, baby.  I will be your shiny lunchbox. It's about time a film lays it out and puts everyone on guard in this PC world that makes us scared to think freely.  Does it promote prejudice?  Hell no.  Does it make fun of stereotypes?  Hell yeah.

It's got lots of sexual stuff in it.  Maybe it's the hormone charged 16-year-old that still controls my brain, but I loved that aspect of the film. Stripper lesbian making out in a cop car,.  Porn star protests.  A chinese crimelord witha  fetish for black chicks and a yen to steal our prtagonist's johnson.  BAM! Suddenly there's a horse dong thrown in for good measure.

It's absurd.  The use of video game graphics, flashbacks, surreal asides, and the full-blown kaiju battle make this morsel of celluloid worthy of your time and appreciation. Plus, it's centered around a guy who needs to electrocute himself to stay alive.  throw in a gay biker gang, a floating head in fluid with a robot voice, and an one of the best endings EVER: FLAMES, BURNING FLESH AND THE MIDDLE FINGER.

This film does not set out to change the world.  It does not take itself so seriously, as it constantly laughs at itself and the characters within.  And that's what makes it so important and awesome.  We forget to laugh at ourselves and each other.  We forget how absurd life is and can be.  And we forget to have fun.  America needs films like this.  We're so caught up with the human condition that we forget that the human condition sucks.

2) Internet connection is NOT required. Actually, it's preferred you disconnect the Ethernet cable from the player so there are no attempts to ""call home""

3793947,2,B001TRDQIQ,"After seeing and mostly enjoying the original Crank, I decided to check out this sequel.  I was hoping for some more good-natured, mindless, violent entertainment to spice up an otherwise boring Tuesday night.

Well, they certainly got the 'mindless' part right.

Crank 2: High Voltage starts off reminding the viewer that Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) died at the end of the last movie.  Well, sorta.  See, it turns out that after falling out of a helicopter onto the roof of a car and landing on the concrete, he was immediately picked up by some goons and taken to some seedy underground hospital room where his heart was stolen and replaced with an artificial one.

Apparently some bad guys wanted to put Chev's heart into the body of some old lecherous crime-lord named Poon Dong because Poon's was giving out from the rigors of old age and young prostitutes.  Chelios had the strongest heart of anyone they knew, so they decided to go after his.

I guess Poon didn't have health insurance or couldn't get on a donor list or something because black market organ harvesting is messy business - especially when the donor wakes up and starts killing all your underlings.

One might wonder why an evil old crime boss wouldn't just take Chelios' heart and let him die, rather than spend the money and resources replacing it with an expensive, high-tech, slightly finicky new one.  Or for that matter, why not just replace his with the artificial one to begin with?  It's not like they were trying to make Chelios a slave to Poon Dong, which could have been an interesting twist.  To the contrary, they just start trying to kill Chelios after he's received his heart transplant, which makes you wonder why they bothered keeping him alive in the first place.

Of course this type of logic has no real place in a movie like this, so let's just get on with the review...

Anyhow, Chelios predictably breaks free of his surgeon captors, and immediately goes on a rampage.  His mission: Get his heart back.

Ahh, but there's a catch.  See, his new heart has an external battery that constantly needs to be recharged.  So Chelios has to find new and creative ways to do this in between shooting up bad guys, getting in fist fights, and running from the authorities.  So Chelios is constantly on the lookout for sources of electricity, be it a car battery, power line, or police Taser.

Now if this was all there was to the movie, honestly, it wouldn't be too bad.  Silly, yes.  But not terribly more so than the first.

Unfortunately, this movie makes some extremely questionable choices in bizarre cut-scenes that made me suspect that someone had slipped some magic mushrooms into my popcorn.

These kind of scenes might work if the director was making a short film in the style of David Lynch.  But this isn't that type of movie.  This kind of movie owes its audience what it promises.  Gun fights.  Fist fight.  Sword fights.  Knife fights.  Blood.  Explosions.  A few scenes of gratuitous nudity.  And some more fighting, just for good measure.  Really, that's all the audience wants.

Instead of enhancing the story or attempting to add depth to one-dimensional characters, the cut-scenes end up taking screen time away from the main character and making the audience sit through painful, boring, awkward parts when all they really want is some fighting and guns.

In short, this film is a bit of a mess.  Worth a rental, maybe, but there are far better films out there in this style that deliver better on what they promise.",1261353600,,3522,4.722495894909688

3793949,4,B001TRDQIQ,"When the turgid member of a race horse is seen from below by two characters engaged in public copulation on the dirt of a horse track, one can't possibly take the movie seriously.  Crank 2: High Voltage is absurd for the sake of absurdity.  Saturated with the scantily clad and nude, replete with the raunchy and ridiculous, with language that makes Scarface blush, the entire purpose of the movie is to entertain without critical reasoning.

It's as if filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor simply threw ideas at one another, attempting to trump one another with the most bizarre movie additions possible.  Bai Ling as a prostitute with hilariously bad Engrish?  Sure.  Porn stars on strike and threatening to bone any spot on a car that resembles an orifice?  Let's do it.  David Caradine as a perverted geriatric Chinese man?  Put it in there.  A turf war between the Chinese and Mexican gangs to harvest the previously poisoned organs - particularly the crank - of Chev Chelios (Statham) after he fell thousands of feet from a helicopter and had his seemingly indestructible heart given to a Triad leader and replaced by a state of the art artificial number that has a predictably short shelf life.  Heck, let's make that the plot!

With several other overboard scenes, this is a film sure to get mixed reviews.  If you like off the wall action, however, and were particularly fond of the unpredictably bizarre nature of the Feast series, then this is where you need to spend the next few hours.

I guess the women in glass bowls distracted me. Regardless, we have more of the same here, just no bowls this time. Mostly it's trying to figure out why suddenly there is no longer any poison in Chev's bloodstream slowing killing him after seeing him literally scrapped off the pavement with a shovel and dumped into the truck of a car. Then on an operating table with his various parts being cut out and sold. He seems to do well with having his heart removed but objects, as any manly man would, to having his ""goodies"" removed, leaps up, slams the doctors around and escapes. Most folks after heart surgery (much less having it completely removed) would have to have a lot of time to recover but not this guy. He's up and around like Superman. But wait, there's more!  We go from amusing, to silly amusing, to silly, to (MOVIE SPOILER) two main characters turned into CG Godzillas battling it out in a miniturized power plant - I kid you not.

Appalled at the way Amy Smart was treated in the first I'd concluded there had been script changes because I couldn't understand why someone as talented as Smart would consent to the China Town public sex exhibition. Apparently, I was wrong again! We take public sex to a whole new level when Chev and Eve ""do it"" on a race track, complete with screaming crowds and at least one aroused horse bounding over them. (Oh good, we're back to YEECH!) Dwight Yoakam once again amazes with his performance as Chev's private physician.

There is amusing and there is completely idiotic. We being with one, and about 2/3's of the way through this thing pretending to be entertainment find ourselves deeply intrenched in the other.

It is not for the squeamish, that's for sure. It is VERY much like a graphic novel, and obviously on purpose. I loved it. I could not stop laughing - in between gasps of pure shock. It was good, unclean, violent, over-the-top fun. It took the first movie and pushed it WAY beyond the bonds of taste. It will offend many, but - as I said - I found it hilarious.",1257292800,,503,4.25
3793959,3,B001TRDQIQ,"""CRANK"" was quite an experience. The movie just basically channels its strength from just how outrageous and over-the-top the scenes can get, it was basically a cartoonish display of violence and mayhem. I didn't exactly figure that writers/directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor would come up with a sequel considering the way ""Crank"" ended. Well, buckle up, fellas, Neveldine and Taylor have unleashed ""CRANK 2: High Voltage"" and it is definitely bigger, louder, sillier than the original film. This type of movie makes fun of itself and is NOT to be taken seriously. The film's ludicrous plot requires a VERY, VERY, VERY HUGE suspension of disbelief and requires a certain taste. I'd be lying if I didn't say that the film is loads of fun to watch and that it serves up a climax that is so outrageously unpredictable.

The movie takes off after the events of ""Crank"" as we see killer-for-hire Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) splattered all over the sidewalk. He should have died right there, (the movie makes no attempts to explain why his body wasn't pulp) but his body was recovered by a Chinese triad so that they can transplant his ""strawberry tart"" (or heart) to their very elderly leader Poon Dong (seriously!). Chelios awakens to escape before the triad can harvest his other body parts and goes on a rampage to recover his natural life-giving pump; requiring a jolt of electricity for his artificial heart so that he can embark on his journey. Along the way, he runs into a spunky prostitute named Ria (Bai Ling), his ex-girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) who is now a sexy stripper, dead friend Kaylo's brother Venus, all the while trying to avoid his former enemies...

Complain all you want about the film's bad dialogue, abrasive hyper-kinetic cinematography, gratuitous nudity (even full frontal), racism and absurd plot devices, this film goes all out. It appears that the creators are all in to outdo the original and they succeed. Directors Neveldine and Taylor doesn't hold back and CRANK 2 does make the original appear like a Disney flick. Like the two filmmakers or not, Taylor and Neveldine does display some of the sensibilities that made Tarantino great; only instead of having a grand knowledge of cinema that references from other films of the past, the two is your kid-in-a-candy store whose passion for filmmaking stems from video games, Asian technological tricks, cartoonish caricatures that is not high art but more like a scribble on a sketch book. They don't have the Tarantino finesse or touch, but they make do with what they have and channels exactly what they want to express that is a movie built on lewd behavior, murder, violence, blood, gratuitous nudity and sex. The two ""Crank"" creators are nuts and their ideas are a hoot!

The film is an on-screen video game complete with an 8-bit Nintendo score. ""Crank 2"" channels its energy from the absurd and the ridiculous. I don't have any idea as to what the crazy subtitles were all about. The writing of the film makes mayhem and debauchery its central focus and Statham and Amy Smart seemed to be very comfortable with their roles. I cannot really dissect the senseless, outrageous gimmicks the two filmmakers have cooked up because it is the film's main strengths; quite frankly the film makes the bare minimum of sense and it makes it its main draw. I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote up the story while they were drunk or they were severely over-caffeinated. (I mean this in a good way) I'll give you a few examples to whet your appetite, Statham and Smart has sex on a horse racing track while a horse leaps overhead showing his attributes, a stripper who gets shot in her implants, there are crazy scenes that channels ""Godzilla"" and ""They Saved Hitler`s Brain"". Whatever idea you can think of, ""Crank 2"" may just have it. Convoluted; yet so much fun.

The film is a direct sequel and honestly, it seems like ""Crank 2"" is the same movie but with more guts to go to the limit. The majority of the characters in the film carry references to the first film and many of them return in the persons of Keone Young, Reno Wilson, Dwight Yoakam, Glenn Howerton, and in a way, Efren Ramirez who plays Kaylo's twin brother; they are easily recognizable as the viewer can easily connect the dots. Ramirez's character is definitely inspired that he has a crazy medical condition that I shouldn't reveal. Bai Ling plays a gutsy Chinese hooker and her character is no less outrageous as Ramirez's. She appears to be a sexy, creepy natural Bai Ling without her prozac. Cehv Chelios is the type of protagonist that I had no qualms in cheering on, because of his tough-fisted approach to any problem. It also helps when he has a girlfriend as sexy as Amy Smart. The film also remembers to pitch in a `mythic' mystery as to what is inside Johnny Vang's (played by Art Hsu) cooler. (ala-""Pulp Fiction"")

""Crank 2: High Voltage"" isn't a great movie but it is definitely great for what it wants to be. One cannot help but give in to all the ridiculousness and silliness of the film's narrative (or close to a linear narrative as it can be). The film is all about revenge mixed in with chase elements, with the ""strawberry tart"" as the main objective. Like Neveldine or Taylor or not, you have to give the two guys their props and appreciate their talent for mayhem and visual manipulation. Despite the fact that they may not approach a true level of artistry and finesse, their rough, edgy and unique style has won me over. The film is a raw exercise of action, mayhem and sex that defies and denies all logic and laws of physics that can turn your brain into gooey matter. It is something that takes everything we've seen in the past and dresses it up as something very different. You will either love this film or hate it; there is just no halfway mark. If there's another sequel (there is a strong hint that there will be), I am pretty sure this time I would be all in.

3793964,5,B001TRDQIQ,"Crank 2 finds our heroes, writer/director duo Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, hot off their success with Crank and coming out with a more commercially viable Gamer, earning some breathing room, spreading their wings and pretty much just going balls out insane.

Crank itself was madness. A hitman, Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is injected with a poison that leaves him no option but to keep his adrenaline pumping nonstop or die. Clearly, the makings of an intense action film, which is what we got. From start to finish it was violent fury, with much more than its fair share of macabre murder humor. The end finds him surviving against impossible odds, although how alive he is can't be told by the simple blink of his eye that we are given.

Crank 2 picks up from that moment. Chelios's body is hustled off by some sinister Chinese men and he is operated on and kept in a medical room for a couple months. By the time he regains awareness (just in time to save his privates from being donated to a mob boss) his heart is missing, replaced by an electronic pumper which he must keep electrically charged.

So we switch from Chelios doing every insane thing he can to keep his excitement up, to Chelios racing after a box with his heart in it, stopping every now and then to find some way to electrocute himself and (whoa! yeah!) kickstart his heart.

Okay, this is madness enough as it is. It's amplified by extra amounts of gore, more grotesque brutality, more perversion, porn star and metalhead cameos, irreverant sidetracking, and a few complete losses of all reality that are far and away the funniest parts of the film.

Oh, and they bought their cameras at Best Buy. It gave it a frantic, independent, in your face, bewildering feel. Between that and the brutal humor and carefree violence, I was surprised at the lack of a cameo from Troma's Lloyd Kaufman. The whole film's right up his alley (minus the $12.9 million price tag, I guess).

It doesn't end there though. This gleefully sadistic film, shot on cheap cameras, was perfectly scored by Mike Patton. The movie is blessed throughout with an eerie, playful, rock soundtrack that suits it perfectly.

Crank 2 is definitely not a movie suitable for a lot of people. Its unashamedly violent and crude to the point of absolutely sick pleasure. There is no redeeming moral code, no truly honorable character. They're all angry, dysfunctional and bent. But it is a masterpiece of divergence. There's really nothing like it. If the bloodier, the meaner, the more out of touch with believablity the film, the more you'll like it, this is for you.

""Crank: High Voltage"" picks up where its predecessor left off. After making an aerial dive, our unstoppable hyper-masculine hero Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) is abducted by Asian gangsters. Apparently they are working for someone who needs Chev's organs badly and they literally ""steal"" his heart, which is replaced by an artificial one.

This means Chev has to move fast to retrieve his stolen heart before the battery runs out. In the first ""Crank"" Jason Statham's character had to stay alive by keeping his adrenaline level up. This time he must run and fight the gangsters while ""charging"" his body with electricity using whatever method and resources he can find.

You can't really expect subtlety in films like ""Crank: High Voltage."" The over-the-top action comedy is unabashedly lewd, crude and violent. The jokes are often brutal, and cheerfully done, whether you like it or not. The supporting characters are vulgar including Dwight Yoakam as sleazy heart surgeon Doc Miles and Ling Bai playing a relentlessly noisy woman Ria who keeps chasing Chev. As to Jason Statham's hero, there is a ""skin-to-skin"" friction sequence in Hollywood Park, which results in the sex scene with Amy Smart's character, in the middle of the horse track (during the race).

I don't mind silly, dirty jokes providing they are funny.

Crank was a nice closed ended movie, then they ressurrected the series by beating the dead horse with an even more improbable storyline. Chev Chelios has, you guessed it, one hour to do something again or he dies. This time, he has get his heart back or he dies, and has to live longer than the one hour, so he keeps having to shock himself to keep his artificial heart pumping.  The skin exposure is more, vulgarity is more, the gore is higher, the action is still present, but the flow is aweful. Plus they keep throwing in jokes that are not funny.  Jason Statham must have really needed the money.  I really liked the first film, but this one could have sat on the shelf.  Definately not recommended.",1253836800,2,758,4.392857142857143

And fans of Amy Smart, who has come a very long way from her Felicity days, can now debate which movie she had sex in public in was the better one.

Not so here...what was with the Godzilla-type fight scene between Chelios and the guy with the red cooler supposed to be anyway? It wasn't funny in the least, and it wasn't good as far as action goes either; it was just plain stupid! Additionally, there was FAR, FAR, FAR too much in the way of profanity. The F-bomb was dropping from the sky in almost EVERY SINGLE SCENE! WHY? Saying the F-word over and over doesn't lend itself to making a movie good, no matter how crappy it is to begin with...case in point...Me, Myself & Irene. Anyway, aside from the always adorable Amy Smart, the acting was horrendous. Even Jason didn't look like he knew what he was doing, and the Asian actors were horrible as well. There were far too many scenes that should have ended up on the editing floor that didn't...scenes about sex, sex, and more sex that had absolutely NOTHING to do with the movie. EXAMPLE: The guy talking to the under-sexed shrink. What significance did that have in the movie at all? NONE! STUPID, JUST STUPID! It was like a bad porno flick gone even worse; Ron Jeremy's presence in the movie is evidence to that! I have a great sense of humor, but the humor here wasn't funny at all. Really now, having sex on a horse track while the crowd cheers is supposed to be funny? I'm not seein' it or feelin' it.

This is so much better than EVERY action film out there, that criticisms are a moot point, but there are a couple problems that I would love to see eliminated for CRANK 3: Jason Statham has no extended hand to hand combat and the end is just as bad as the end of the first one. Statham is one of the few white guys who looks as cool doing martial arts as Asian dudes, yet these CRANK movies deny us the spectacle of TRANSPORTER-level fight scenes. Also, the endings of these two movies SUCK! There is nothing interesting about watching people point weapons and other people fall.

3794003,1,B001TRDQIQ,"As someone who found the original Crank movie to be watchable and entertaining, I was anxious to see Crank 2.

Unfortunately, Crank 2 recycled all the bits and parts and characters from the first Crank and edited it all on the blender setting of crush.  What you end up with is a totally worthless 90 minutes.  Where Crank 1 was different and exciting with a premise that was plausible, Crank 2 starts off with a completely unbelievable premise and continues to add to the implausibility ad nauseum. Sure, there are some good action sequences and a lot of nude women, but all of it is edited in such a way that it cannot be enjoyed as anything resembling entertainment.

The only characters that were worth watching were the girlfriend played by Amy Smart, but only during the first hour, and Dwight Yoakam as the doctor friend.  However, please note that I did not include their character names in this review for the simple fact that I can't recall them - so much for relating to the characters in this mess of a movie.  I basically was not interested in the least if the lead character (Chelios) got his heart back and was hoping that the jolts of electricity would have killed him earlier.  Honestly, I don't know how any of the characters/actors survived the huge chasms in the story lines, the fall would have killed the bionic man.  Speaking of which, this movie, and the only reason I believe Statham actually came back to do it, was to be pictured as some super human super man.

Stay away from this movie at all costs as it is just an ego trip for Statham that was completely and utterly unnecessary.",1253059200,4,1610,4.5432525951557095
3794004,2,B001TRDQIQ,"Well, I must say I was a bit unhappy with this film.  I really liked the first one, the story was good, characters were good, and violence...spot on!

This movie wasn't the upgrade I was hoping for, its got a lot of scenes running at double speed (I guess to simulate the rush of having to find power for the heart) I think it was used way to much, it gets repetitive.  The whole movie plays out with Chev going from point A to point B and stopping somewhere in between for some ""juice"".

I didn't expect an epic story line or anything, I just feel like the first one played out a lot better, the pace was good and the characters were easy to keep track of...which is a must in a movie like this.  All and all its worth a watch if your an action junkie but I can honestly say I would have been good watching the first one and just stopping there.

On a side note, a good side note at that: The Blu-Ray version kinda, yes kinda redeems this film. The picture is a amazing, which surprised me really.  I think back to a scene with a bunch of cargo containers, the detail in the painted metal surfaces is jaw dropping.  Also for the scenes with a speed boost, the picture stays crisp and clean.  Blu-Ray also gives us a bonus with the sound here, just know the 7.1 DTS:MA sounds stunning!  The movie never lets up with crashes, gun shots, screams, stuff breaking, and the screaming of the F-word every 10-15 seconds comes over loud and clear!

Rent this one, enjoy it with a beer and some hot wings...but don't expect to say WOW! in a good way, when the credits roll.",1253059200,2,1564,4.214765100671141

Picking up where the last one left off, it seemed that the creators were the ones who were on a rush. The desire to make the effects bigger and badder than the first one is just ludicrous. I was hoping for this one to be like the last one, but was sorely disappointed.

The movie has a significant increase in nudity (to the point that there is hardly a clothed female in it) and the language is so harsh that parts are unwatchable. It loses itself into idiocy several times and resembles a poorly done asian action movie with a low budget (i.e. the ""godzilla"" style fight scene in the power plant).

I kept watching, hoping it would get better, but the longer it was on, the worse it got. Absolutely dreadful. This is the one and ONLY Jason Statham movie I have seen that I have not just loved.

Now I like a good trashy explotive film as much as the next person, but even with lowered expectations for a ""Crank"" film, I was shocked at what a ridiculous film this was.  I was saddened watching Bai Ling, who is an accomplished,(or was) Chinese film actress, reduced to a trailer trash fish wife, the worst stereotype of a low-life, street [...].  I would have loved to have heard the pitch that convinced Jason Stratham into attaching his name and reputation to this piece of trash.  Looking back, this might be the turning point (and not in a good way either, for one of the testosterone poster boys)

I suppose one might find some humor in the race track [...] scene, but I can't imagine any actor involved in this, being proud of this being added to their body of work.  Don't believe me?  Trust me, NONE of these actors is going to be putting this on their home theaters to show family and friends next Thanksgiving.

Imagine Quentin Tarantino lobotomized, making a film, and REALLY dumb down the ""hey, wouldn't it be cool if they..."" kind of tidbits that texture this movie and you'll have a mind boggling experience trying to imagine how anyone could be crass enough to turn out such utter junk.

All in all, this would rate as one of Siskel and Ebert's all time ""Stinkers of the Week"".  No other word typifies this film other than, EXCREBAL.

The storyline is simple; Chev Chelios (Statham) survived the thousand-foot fall from the helicopter at the end of ""Crank"", is kidnapped by Chinese who surgically remove his heart (replacing it with a temporary artificial one, until they can harvest his other organs...including his ""Big English"" attribute), but he recovers in time to beat up the surgical team and escape, spending the rest of the film brawling, shooting, and, uh, other things, while struggling to keep the temporary heart charged, in a race against time to recover his own.

This is a film that even Neveldine and Taylor admits was an excuse to see just how much they could get away with (including legendary porn stars on strike...a climactic fight in slow-motion, wearing caricatured masks...hot passion in the middle of a racetrack, with thousands watching...a talking, disembodied head...David Carradine as a very horny 100-year-old Chinese man...and wait to you see the variety of power sources Chelios utilizes), so keep a very open mind!",1252886400,4,1778,5.191637630662021

Western Culture is dead and Dwight Yoakam will try to fix your heart?

It was 80 minutes of non-stop action that went completely over-the-top...When I saw the trailer for the second movie, I instantly thought 'wtf? seriously?' The trailer showed a similar gimmick to the first movie (instead of keeping up his adrenaline, main character Chev Chelios needs to keep his heart electrically-charged), only one that not only defied all logic but threw all logic out the window. I did not have high hopes for this sequel, at all.

What surprised me is that I liked this film better than it's predecessor. What Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the writers and directors) have done is taken all of the elements that made the first movie good and only added more action and more absurdity.

Jason Statham retuns as Chev Chelios, who we last saw falling out of a helicopter and landing in a Los Angeles intersection. Well, as this film begins, he is scraped off of said intersection by the Chinese so they can remove his ""superman heart,"" which they replace with an artificial heart requiring an electrical charge. Chev is soon in pursuit of Johnny Vang (Art Hsu), whom Chev believes has his heart, and runs into Eve (Amy Smart) and just about every other character from the first movie along the way.

When I said that Neveldine/Taylor took all the elements that made the first film successful, I wasn't kidding; actors appear here whether they died in the first film or not (Efren Ramirez returns playing Venus, the brother of Kaylo, who died in the first movie) and Statham and Smart have another public sex-scene together.

Audiences need to keep in mind when watching this that it's basically a filmed video-game. Anything is possible, nothing is off-limits. This movie requires one to suspend all disbelief to truly enjoy it.

Crank: High Voltage is one of the best action films of 2009 and is also hysterically funny. It's the ultimate guy movie, really. Is any scene from a 2009-movie more ridiculously random than the ""Godzilla"" power-plant scene? If you enjoyed the first movie, you should love this one as well. Also, look for an appearance by the late David Carradine.

I would definitely recommend renting, borrowing, watching it on TV, or downloading before buying.  If you're into ridiculous over-the-top off-color humor it may be your movie, but I still wouldn't recommend buying before you see it.",1251504000,,679,4.852173913043479

Crank: High Voltage is a roller coaster ride that last 85 minutes and features some really gross scenes. For example, a guy getting a shotgun rammed up his rear end isn't even in the top three weird moments in this flick. There was one scene where a guy had to punish himself for letting his boss down, which I had to turn my head and look away (I can't remember the last time I did that). There is almost zero realism here, much like the original, only multiplied by a hundred. Jason Statham is the main action star in the business right now and he is pretty good at what he does. He went all out here and I'm sure he has nothing but bruises and a nice paycheck to show for it. The large supporting cast was better than average and Amy Smart was especially yummy. If you liked Crank (2006) you will probably enjoy this one well enough, but I think they should put this series to rest. Judging by the ending during the credits, I'm sure we can expect Crank 3-D: Zombie Chev in the near future.",1251072000,32,1101,4.173708920187793

Doc Miles tells him that the Chinese gave him an AbioCor Artificial heart, and he must keep it charged, or he will die. He has jumper cables helping him, rubbing up against an old woman, makin' sweet love to his girlfriend, Eve on a horse race track, and grabbing electric wires.

Crank 2 sure as hell blows the last film out of the water, it's more action packed, silly and funny as f**k, I could not stop laughing because of this film, there's so many cool moments I guess one of highlights on the film for me, would have to be the fight scene at the power station which looks like something out of a Godzilla fight which is funny.

Specifically, men who loves violence, sex, and games (gore too, but I just closed my eyes during those scenes). If you loved the first Crank, you'll love the second one even more. It carries the comical air, doesn't take it self seriously, and gets even more crazy and inventive with how much fun they can make a movie.

The beginning reminds me of a typical video game, you start unarmed, whack a few guys, get a pistol, whack a few more guys, then you get a shotgun. It's does this without falling in love with it self. The action is fast and blistering, showing no more than needed for the most part. There are a few flashbacks that aren't really needed, but they tend to be just a few frames.

The story arch is a typical one, but it does this while breaking a lot of cliches and using them at the same time. This movie is not for the faint of heart, the conservative, or the sensitive of any kind. It pulls a lot of racial punches but manages to be hilarious while doing it (I'm Cantonese, and I don't find the tone of the movie to be serious enough to be offended in any way).

3794047,2,B001TRDQIQ,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Chev Chelios (Jason Statham) gets the short end of the stick in a one-sided body part trade, after falling from a helicopter at the end of the first movie.
2. He escapes when he learns which part is next up on the list.
3. The battery for his Chinese-implanted artificial heart has to be charged frequently, by any means possible.
4. ""Any means"" in this case involves a lot of gratuitous violence, public exhibitionism, corny humor, a crazy hooker, a gay man with Tourette's Syndrome and even a couple of dream sequences.
5. This is a movie only a guy could love.

This one totally failed for me, but I can see why it would appeal to some audiences.  Too bizarre and cranked up for my taste, but to each his own.
