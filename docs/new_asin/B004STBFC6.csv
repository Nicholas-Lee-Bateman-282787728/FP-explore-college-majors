8440228,5,B004STBFC6,Looks silly and somewhat dumb...but Sgt. Frog is a great anime,1425686400,,62,4.7272727272727275
8440229,5,B004STBFC6,"My son got me hooked on mangas and Sgt Frog & crew are just the funniest thing.  We googled & saw that Japan is years ahead of us and can't wait for them to be translated into English.  Not only are teh ARMPIT crew funny, they are addicting.  So PLEASE hurry and translate the rest of the series.  My son has all the books, but the show make it all come to life. Plus we get to see life in other ways.",1317772800,2,401,3.8536585365853657
8440230,5,B004STBFC6,"This is by far starting out to be the best season yet. Keroro & Co are back with more evil plans to take over Earth, or at the very least annoy Natsumi. Episodes are hilarious in both Japanese original audio and English dub. This show is great for people of all ages and everyone will laugh at every episode. A great buy and a great price for part 1 of season 3. A definite recommendation for all anime fans.",1312761600,,408,4.177215189873418
8440231,5,B004STBFC6,"It starts strong...continues strong..and ends on a good note!  This season is really about Tamama and Geroro.  These discs are backed with more laughs then the first two seasons combine.  There were episodes in disk one where I literally was laughing so hard for so long, I think I might of laughed through the whole episode.  This is the first time I have laughed this hard since I was a kid!

Seriously:
Rich girl agrees to allow aliens to destroy her house for the soul mission of making her relationship with her favorite nerd closer.  Then her friend helping her ends up blowing up his love, to keep his word.  Until his love figures out what's going on and turns on him...all in hillarity.

This is the level 85 mage, that would looks amazing compared to all the other level 12 paladin wannabe (anime) that just isn't as good at making you laugh.  Ok there WOW references are way funnier!  Just watch it!  DO IT!",1312588800,,918,4.503030303030303
8440232,5,B004STBFC6,"I have been waiting awhile for this to come out. I absolutely loved the first two seasons of Sgt. Frog and I prayed for more. Eventually, my prayers were answered and I was not disappointed. Funimation continues to do a great job dubbing this series in an American style that makes it as funny to us as the original does for the Japanese. If you enjoy Shin-chan or any series like that, be sure to pick up this entire series.",1312243200,,425,4.325
8440233,5,B004STBFC6,"Where do I begin?

This has become one of my favorite anime series of all time, and I was very pleased that FUNimation decided to give us more episodes.

This season starts out with a bang, including a new opening song that includes the original Japanese logo, unlike the previous released. Also to clear this up, the opening song is now  ""Zenkoku Musekinin Jidai"" (""Era of Nationwide Irresponsibility"") instead of ""Ribbit March"", which Amazon has it listed as.

Includes the following episodes on a 2-disc DVD thinpack set.

DISC ONE
52: Green Dwarf, Back To Earth!
53: Cherry Blossoms of Terror!
54: Dial M For Maybe I Can Solve This Murder!
55: Armagarden!
56: Hard To (Be A) Swallow!
57: Viper Rash!
58: My Snoballs Give Me Redbulls!

DISC TWO
59: The House That Trash Built!
60: Honey, I Shrunk The Frogs!
61: Very Superstitious, Writings On The Rock-Stone Thing!
62: Take Another Little Piece Of My Art Now Baby!
63: It Had To Be Ew!
64: I Won't Cry With A Little Help From My Friends!
65: ET: The Extra-Special Terrestrial!

AUDIO
Includes the standard dub and sub.
The dub really shows how good it can be here, being very faithful to the Japanese script, while still retaining the American jokes that give its' appeal.

VIDEO
As usual, great picture quality in 4:3 fullscreen format.

CONCLUSION
Overall, this is a great addition to your SGT. Frog collection, and you will not be disappointed from this purchase.
Be on the lookout for Season 3 Part 2, which should be arriving on August 23!

Frog out!
