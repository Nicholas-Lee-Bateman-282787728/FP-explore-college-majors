3971224,1,B002R0LRK8,"I'm not going to go into the plot of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation has yet again releases another upscaled piece of garbage.

This Blu-ray set has a number of issues with the video. The images are blurry, the lines are fuzzy, colors washed out, everything as a glow around it, there is noticeable gradient banding, and artifacting during many scenes. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.

If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning this because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.

I added a screenshot to the images section to show how bad this release is. Make sure to look at it full size, as it naturally looks better at a smaller size. Also the screenshot was not altered in any way from the Blu-ray source.

Also don't buy this set, go for the collection if you are going to get it.",1297900800,9,1035,4.431578947368421
3971225,4,B002R0LRK8,"Well first I'd like to say, I've only read the first two volumes of the manga so I don't know how close it is and all. It's just I was kinda disappointed with the end of season 2.

***************************This might be considered a spoiler*********************
Well the question I wanted answered were: Who's the Syaoran in the jar? What's Xing Huo's part in the story? And my biggest question I wanted answered was ""What was with the prologue?!"" And none of the questions were answered. I know there is an OVA but I read reviews saying it's an OVA better watched by the Manga followers. I'm now planning to read a little more of the manga. I gave it a four star because it was still good and fun to watch, it just didn't answer any of my questions. You did learn a little about Kurogane's past, but Fai's history is still a big secret. So if you thought that this would be the end of Tsubasa, well guess again. SO if you havn't read the manga like me. Don't expect to see an end.
************************************End of spoilers*******************************

All in all, read the manga if you haven't and don't expect any questions to be answered.",1294272000,,1156,4.661764705882353
3971226,5,B002R0LRK8,"Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle, an anime that makes me smile everytime I hear someone say it. Tsubasa is a fantastic anime. CLAMP has done a great job with it.

With common voices such as Vic Mignogna (Edwrad Elric, Dark Mousy, Zero Kiryu), Christphor R. Sabat (Vegeta) and many others, they all make this anime great. Every voice goes well with the characters.

Okay, so most of Season 2 of Tsubasa might be fillers, but that doesn't make the anime suck. It may have made me a bit mad, but the fillers really weren't that bad. They went a long well with this anime. I recommend any CLAMP fan add season 2 of Tsubasa to their collection.",1292198400,,634,4.504347826086956
3971227,5,B002R0LRK8,"Just as addicting as the first year.  Though it seems slightly more colorful.  The music is still very good.  One story about two ""gods"" is rather incomprehensible to western thinking in how it ends, or even why they are at war in the first place, but the series as a whole is good, and even this arc is enjoyable, even if it leaves you feeling a bit confused as to their motives.",1264032000,,380,4.25
3971228,3,B002R0LRK8,"This set of Tsubasa - covering the middle third of the story which we might call the ""happy family"" stage - is, like it's predecessor, a mixed bag, but differs from it in three major points - a roughly 50% filler material rate, the increased participation of Sakura with her larger feather count, and the gang having now reached the point where they know eachother well and have become an adoptive family - the men having essentially become the kids' foster parents with Kurogane the father figure and Fai, being the more touchy-feely of the two, becoming the mother figure by default.

A few things unfortunately drag the series down at times, with the set including the drag race Piffle World arc which is widely considered one of the worst cannon arcs of Tsubasa and a few bad filler stories like the two Mokona-centric episodes.

That is not to say that the series is a total waste by any means.  There are also some rather good filler stories, such as one in which the gang make a return trip to a world they've already visited and the kids learn a rough lesson about not always being able to help everyone, and a sweet-natured one shot in which Fai befriends an AU version of his created life form Chii.  The highlight of the set is probably almost everything having to do with Kurogane, from his pride in Syaoran's progress to the growing tension between himself and Fai regarding the magician's evasiveness vis a vis his past, and above all his backstory, which explains why he's become the person he is.  And, ever so slowly, we get hints of what is to come in the shattering Acid Tokyo arc which is apparently covered in the Tokyo Revelations OVA which will hopefully be released in Region 1 sooner rather than later.

In the final analysis, this set includes a little good, a little bad, and alot in between.",1262304000,8,1819,4.581538461538462

3971230,5,B002R0LRK8,"Welcome back to my review of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles season 2. Please enjoy!

Characters and Plot: (minor spoilers only) If you havn't seen this series yet or haven't read my last review here is quick recap. Sakura is a princess from a desert world where all of her memories have been stolen, so Syaoran her knight in shining armor and unknown lover. Kurogane the grumpy samurai. Fei Flowright the wizard along with white Mokona travel to different worlds and different demensions to get back Sakura's memories in the form of feathers that have mighty magical powers.

Pros: This half of the second season is filled with more cross overs from other animes, Like xxxHolic, Chobits, Cardcaptor Sakura and some others. The crossovers characters appear with the same attitudes and mannerism from their other animes but have different memories because they are from different worlds in Tsubasa. The action is done well again. You learn more about characters past's which make you feel more intune and more connect to each characters. You see more villians from past episode return in different worlds and some worlds from the 1st season are revisted again because more feathers have appeared in that world. Yuko comes in every popping in every now and then and it is shown she plays a bigger part in the series. This dvd set holds episodes 27-52 which is the end of the main anime series here. The fight scenes are pretty good, better than season 1 in my oppion. Comedy is more revelent in season 2.

Cons: (MINOR SPOILERS!)  Once again my problem is with the writting of the villians. Fai-Wong Reed's evil plan is still never fully told which got me confused of why would you put this in the show if you are never going to tell the people what you are up to. Also the other reoccuring villians that pop up in other worlds trying to find Sakura's feathers, their pasts are never told either so its like the writers just added in evil villians for no reason just to keep the show going. Also Fei Flowrights pasts is still a complete mystery other than his relationship to one of the cross over characters.

Over all: I still like this series! I just wish they would have written it out a bit more. Otherwise I liked it alot! Buy this series!!!!",1434585600,,2243,4.668354430379747

3971262,3,B002R0LRK8,"Season 2 continues continues season 1 and virtually everything you liked and disliked about season 1 returns in full force for season 2.  I normally wouldn't bother to review the second season, but there are certain things about it I wish I had known before going into it.  Things that might have made me think twice about buying it.

The second season really does follow in the footsteps of the first, decently emulating the strengths and weaknesses of the first season, with one exception: the filler.  Whereas the first season had a sizeable amount of filler episodes to extend and fill out the season, season two is more than 50% filler.  Without it, the sheer canon only episode count taken from (or at least inspired by) the events depicted in the manga is less than 13 episodes, and, if I remember correctly, are restricted to the first half of the season.

The filler content itself is a mixed bag, with a few standout episodes Clamp fans might be interested in, and a lot of episodes that just feel pointless.  The highlight of this filler is ""Kero and Mokona"", which is a joy to watch subbed if you're familiar with CardCaptor Sakura, as Kero's original voice actor returns to reprise his role.  However, most of the filler just feels like filler.

I bought season 2 along with the ova collection thinking that without season 2, I might find myself lost watching the OVAs (even though I've read the manga... I guess I'm just a completionist).  I was surprised and completely unaware that the ovas don't exist in the same canon as the two seasons of anime.  Season two overwrites the events directly preceding the ovas in the name of filler.  The library arc is included in season two, but the ending has been changed to prolong their journey.  So if you're thinking you need to buy season 2 in order to follow the events of the ovas... you don't really.  Or anyway, you'll be confused when suddenly half of season 2 didn't happen and things seemed to have ended differently than you saw in the library.

Season one barely got 4 stars from me because it was so cheap.  Season two only gets three stars despite being so cheap for the unprecedented amount of filler.  Tsubasa might still be a good gateway anime, but season two makes it much harder for everyone else to enjoy it.",1345075200,4,2286,4.604938271604938

3971264,4,B002R0LRK8,"This picks up with the heroes in a new world following the manga less than halfway until it decides to do its own thing and present a different set of side stories/branches.  I'm a big fan of the manga and read all 28 volumes which I thought wrapped up quite nicely by the end.  The anime seems a bit tame in comparison but that's always the case from page to screen.  The animation is consistent and colourful, action is fast but never feels hard hitting. It can't compare to the film releases: ""Tokyo Revelations"" and ""Spring of Thunder"" are of note.

I didn't stick with the English voice acting while watching, as I didn't think it quite suit the series.  Last anime I watched in English was Samurai Champloo, which was surprisingly well done despite being very Japanese in flavour. There's just something quite endearing to hear Japanese Syaoran/Siu Long speak and refer to Sakura as ""him"". Doesn't quite sound right in English though.  And as always it's good to see the cast alive on screen after all their quirky interactions, from Kurogane's tough guy big daddy disposition, to Fai's cheerful jibes. Mokona is the white puffball we love from before.

Id say a show worth watching and Owning.

Overall Rating 3.5/5
A strong group of characters travel between many different dimensions to gather the feathers of Sakuras memories.  This is part 2 of tv Series.  It is very recommended you buy the OVA as well. The OVA picks up a ways after the show and leaves the show with a more complete ending.

If you haven't heard of the show, its a tie-in show for most all studio Clamps shows.  A large portion of the shows characters are either directly referenced or remade to suit this show.  Watching all the other shows isn't necessary but adds to the backgrounds a bit.  xxxHolic before Tsubasa would be a plus though.
Anyhow, its alright adventure story.  This part has Sakura more involved since she is closer to being complete again.  The characters get stronger as you would expect

Theme Songs 4/5
As with part 1, this season has another good opening and ending.  Mostly fast paced, I didn't skip them.

Ending 3/5
