8005352,5,B000127Z78,I got this for my grandchild for Christmas as it was a program on TV my children loved when they were small. Loved watching it again.,1388534400,,133,4.153846153846154
8005353,2,B000127Z78,"I bought this movie for a 4 year old boy who loves Brum.  I was so excited to give it to him and see the look on his face.  It finally comes so I pop it open and it says in huge print ""for screening purposes only"" so there is no menu, and all through the video the screen has the words for screening purposes only.  I was so disappointed and I had to get him a different gift last minute.",1370649600,,388,3.765432098765432

8005355,4,B000127Z78,My six year old son and family love the Brum DVD.  It was very clear and fun to watch.,1152662400,,86,3.526315789473684
8005356,5,B000127Z78,"... and so with the above words at the start of every episode Brum the little vintage car slips out of his garage, past his owner and speeds off to a unknown city somewhere in England.  An absolutely charming and fantastically fun show, Brum follows the adventures of the titular hero as he apprehends villains, chases giant balloons full of whipped cream, captures escaped mice in discos and stops run-away barber's chairs! From this description you may be surprised to learn that this show is entirely live-action and 100% wild and crazy!  Aimed at the under 6's but appealing to everyone (this 30 year old loves it as much as his 2 year old son) Brum is littered with crazy regular characters such as Granny Slippers and a man who takes his garden gnomes out for walks!  The music is superb giving each character a theme and giving the cartoonish chases a perfect underscore.  I defy anyone to watch this show without having a huge grin on their face by the time it ends!",1079654400,2,974,4.580459770114943
8005357,5,B000127Z78,"My kids (1.5 yrs and 3.5 yrs) learned of Brum one early morning when we chanced upon it on the Discovery Kids channel. It's really amazing. I am not sure why they love it, but they do. All about this little antique car that 'saves the day in big town' in each episode (his name is Brum), the episodes are all live-action (ya gotta love that!) and filled with music. Oddly, I saw BRUM on sale at a radio shack store as a radio-controlled car, so I bought one for the kids. It's one of those shows they ask for in the morning now, so I was thrilled to see the videos hit the shelves.",1078704000,3,581,4.060869565217391
