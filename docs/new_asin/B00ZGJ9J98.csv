8720137,5,B00ZGJ9J98,"We love this real- life family series and their adventures on the mission field. Excellent cinematography.  Perfect for families with older children.
This particular disc (#2) has scenes that involve eating insects; however the boy cousins we gave it to thought it was funny.  (Gag for Moms- Fun for Kids!)",1498003200,,306,5.1

8720139,5,B00ZGJ9J98,"This is a film #2 in a series of and by the three teenage sons of the Wild family, a missionary family living for several years [and still living there] in the jungles of Papua, New Guinea. The boys are homeschooled and part of their schooling is making films. This 28 minute presentation features the Wild family [the 3 teenage boys and their parents] telling of and showing ""their world."" This is very entertaining, geared for teenagers but enjoyed by this great-grandmother, too. Be sure to see the previous production, #1, Welcome to Our World and #3, The Paradise Lost.",1453334400,2,574,4.75

8720141,5,B00ZGJ9J98,"Fun stuff! Curious, cute boys in the wild! How amazing to watch these with my girls who are between grossed out and admiring of these guys in the jungle of Papua, Indonesia. As a homeschooler, I love to see these ""unschooled"" kids thrive without the textbook schooling. One brother even is collecting bird specimen for a museum! Good viewing!",1453248000,,342,4.813559322033898

8720143,5,B00ZGJ9J98,"This 25 minute video is loaded with scientific facts and information on many different species of butterflies and moths.  It is so fascinating watching this family live within the Papua tribe regiont.  Not only were my wife and I interested in this show, my 3 girls love watching this new, short series!  It is great to listen to their father, a missionary (and scientist) discuss specifics on God's Creation and how it leads back to the Creator. Please keep these episodes coming!",1451347200,,481,4.841463414634147
