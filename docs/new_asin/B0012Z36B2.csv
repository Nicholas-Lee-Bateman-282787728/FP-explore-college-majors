8248410,1,B0012Z36B2,"This is an extremely poor copy! Remember the movie ""Multiplicity"" with Michael Keaton? Well, this DVD seems like it's a ""copy of a copy of a copy""! It's video images are fuzzy and slightly out of focus. Just to the point of being quite irritating, actually. I'd never recommend buying it - you might be able to find a better rendition (copy) on the internet somewhere; this DVD video, from an image quality perspective, sucks big time!",1353456000,,435,4.662337662337662
8248411,4,B0012Z36B2,"A very good video on the life and design of the Harrier VTOL aircraft, focus is split between the British VTOL and the American VTOL aircraft, all in all a good film.",1304467200,,166,4.21875
