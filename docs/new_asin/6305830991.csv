1080872,1,6305830991,"Bokeem Woodbine did good work in ""THE BIG HIT"", ""DEAD PRESIDENTS"" & ""GRIDLOCK'D"" but after them he has only done crap, besides his movie ""NEW BREED"" these is his worst...
It's actually one of the worst movies of all time, and who was the guy who named it BLACK MALE? Bokeem's race has nuthin to do with the movie, and the big role is played buy an unknown British actor who's about as good as Steven Segal at acting...
Lousy script, everything sucks!",1065916800,,450,4.433734939759036
1080873,4,6305830991,"This movie is entertaining, period. The joke is on you when you begin to take the movie seriously.  pretty soon you realize that the villan is a crack smoking serial killer with a disposition and voice of an English Prince.",1055376000,3,223,4.575
1080874,5,6305830991,"Okay, If you watch this movie expecting to see some amazingly deep, oscar worthy movie, you're going to be disappointed. If you're easily offended (or disgusted) then you're not gonna be happy with this movie. For the rest of us (who enjoy a lil t&a and hilarious ""i-got-my-thumb-cut-off"" scenes), this movie's great. Perhaps i think it's so amazing because of my deep and profound love for Justin Pierce (1975 - 2000 R.I.P) aka Luther. I dunno. I liked it though. I thought it was absolutely hilarious, although at times it was kinda disgusting.",1023494400,5,546,4.881720430107527
1080875,1,6305830991,"Click the back button on your browser right now.  This film is the culmination of everything that is soul-less and unholy.  I feel dirty having to give this film a single star, but i feel that by warning the rest of you to not view this film, the means is justified.
  If you haven't already clicked the back button, allow me to explain why this film is an utter waste of your time.  We'll break it down into 3 simple parts; Story, Scripting, and Directing.

  First the story is awful.  Imagine six guys get together at a summer bbq and after hours of heavy drinking decide ""hey, lets write a movie"".  They decide to, instead of colaborating during the writing process, each write a small part alone and then combine the six pieces together into one project.  Oh thats not how it was written?  Well you could have fooled me.  The story is as exciting as Stephen Hawking delivering the State of the Union address and, as an added bonus, the scenes go from bad to worse faster than a donkey eating a waffle.  This is not only due to the lack of realism but also the fact that my three year old cousin could write better dialogue.
  They must have been really sauced when they wrote the script for this one.  The film lacks character development and the relationships are no where near as deep as the hole this film has burned into my soul.
  I hope directors George and Mike Baluzy don't go putting this one on their resumes.  I'd hate for them to be screened out for WalMart sales associate of the year, or maybe I wouldn't.  I think they were both absent from class the day the ""Cutting Room"" was discussed.  The truth of the matter is I could make a better film with $100, 3 washers, a quart of kerosene in a squeeze bottle, and waterproof matches.
  The acting is just awful.  And that's really all I can say about that.  (Just thinking about it makes me want to boot all over myself)
  I think that everyone who has seen this film, besides 'A Viewer From NY NY', should get together a class action lawsuit because this was 90 minutes of our lives we'll never get back.
  So, unless you're a sadist, don't make the same mistake I did.  Click your back button while there is still time.",1023062400,6,2188,4.354838709677419
1080876,1,6305830991,"This was undoubtedly the worst thing God ever allowed to happen on Earth.  The entire movie was complete non-sense.  The movie was based around a tape of a doctor cheating on his wife.  Thats the blackmail(""Black Male""...  cause one guy in the movie is black... get it?)  But this tape wasn't made with hidden cameras or anything, it was just a big man following the cheater around with a videocamera.  I guess the doctor was suffering from Hysterical CameraMan Blindness.  Oh yeah, another good scene was when the Black Male got harassed by a cop because of a flat tire.  Not such a big deal until it turns out that theres a dead body in the trunk as well.  For some reason, the body starts gushing blood and when the blood starts pooling up on the pavement, the only conclusion the cop can draw is that the guy cut himself.  Luckily when the cop finally realizes that the gallons of blood aren't coming from a cut, his head gets run over by a car.  At this point I couldn't even continue watching the movie, as it was making me vomit over and over again until my TV screen was completely covered in stomach acid.",995500800,4,1114,4.411764705882353
1080877,3,6305830991,"This movie was quite hysterical despite the fact that this ""Thriller"" was not meant to be a comedy.  The main plot consists of two pathetic and desperate con men attempting to blackmail a serial killing doctor who's mental state is way past questionable and the repayment of money to a deranged and violent loan shark.
The actors were bad and tried to over compensate for such a poorly written script latent with good intentions not to mention the predictability of occurrences.  But through all of the flaws in the script, continuity and cinematography, I found myself irresistibly drawn to reach the conclusion of the movie...thus proving my hypothesis on Black Male=Visual Extortion.  It held my interest captive up until the very end.  And to see Bokeem Woodbine dressed as a woman is worth the price of rental or purchase. TRUST ME!
I suggest viewing the movie if you life offbeat and quirky flicks or just need a good laugh.  It sure kept me in stitches!",990057600,,960,4.793939393939394

If you like cool movies with a twist of thrills and comedy, you may want to check this out.

I personally thought is was awesome and is worth at least a rent if your looking for something different.",1161907200,,314,4.305084745762712

But I gave it a chance and this turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Whoever was in charge of marketing this film ought to be fired, because judging from the cover one would expect to see a action/thriller.  Well, it has action, a bit of gore but it's mostly a comedy.  Very funny stuff!  I recommend it to anyone with a slightly deranged sense of humor!",1156032000,3,516,4.12

If you decide to have a day of watching the worst movies of all time, be sure to include this one!  Too bad I couldn't give it half a star, it didn't really deserve that.",1077494400,,337,3.926470588235294
