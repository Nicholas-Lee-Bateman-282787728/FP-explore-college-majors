8346095,5,B001VDJ5PG,"My son was struggling with the end of a relationship and I kept referring to ""When Harry Met Sally.""  He had no idea what I was talking about, but I told him it really fit their situation in some respects.  I had checked the local stores and had no luck -- not even in the big $5 dump bins.  I searched on the internet and Amazon had it and then I found the bonus set.  ""Say Anything"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" are two movies on my favorites list.  The price -- even with shipping -- made it an easy decision to add to my limited collection.  Now, I just need my son to sit down and watch it with me.",1348185600,,608,3.942622950819672
