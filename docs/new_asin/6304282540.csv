2024114,4,6304282540,"This was an entertaining movie intended for young viewers and families.  No, it is not an accurate depiction of Space Camp but it's not intended to be.  Other than the incredibly weak acting by the central actor, Thomas Horn, I thought it was a descent movie.  Some of the scenes and activities that take place are a bit unrealistic but again, this isn't a documentary about Space Camp.  In fact, I'm not sure why Amazon added (Space Camp) to the title.  (Space Camp) does not appear on the DVD cover or on IMDB.com.  This movie is a good family movie with a positive message that will entertain the kids.",1374710400,,605,4.504587155963303
2024115,2,6304282540,"I really wanted to like this movie. There is so much in it that I am predisposed to love. The cast is good, the premise is fun and it's about Space Camp. Sadly, it's written and directed like a hastily assembled after school special.  It's directed with an annoying ""aren't we cute?"" quality that makes it hard to buy into the characters. You could drive a car through the holes in the plot, even for a sci-fantasy. If you have youngsters on the young side they may enjoy it.",1374364800,3,475,4.337078651685394

2024118,5,6304282540,"Space geeks will envy the rip-roaring adventures in the movie, ""Space Warriors."" I was pleasantly surprised to see that the plot was simpler than I imagined. Before I watched the movie, the title made me cringe, suggesting that it was about teenagers battling aliens in a cheesy rampage through outer space. Clearly, I was wrong to judge a movie by its poster. ""Space Warriors"" is a fun and unexpectedly down-to-earth film for all ages.

Jimmy Hawkins (Thomas Horn, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close""), the son of a retired NASA astronaut, is a complete astronomy geek. His dream is to go to space, and the opportunity arises in the form of Space Camp, where teams can compete for the chance to go to space. His parents, played by Dermot Mulroney and Mira Sorvino, forbid him to join Space Camp fearing for his safety, but Jimmy joins anyway. At Space Camp he meets the brightest, nerdiest group of astronomy-lovers, called Space Warriors. They have to learn to work together as a team not only to win the competition, but to save the lives of three astronauts along the way as well.

Colonel Manley (Josh Lucas), one of the commanders at Space Camp, is one of my favorite characters - he's witty and smart with just a touch of dry humor and sarcasm. Sean McNamara (""Soul Surfer"") is the director of ""Space Warriors."" Along the same lines of ""Soul Surfer,"" this movie has many great themes that include teamwork, leadership, overcoming fear, thinking outside the box, making wise choices and most importantly, it shines a positive light on youth. The Space Warriors don't let anyone look down on them because of their age - they prove to the entire world that age doesn't matter as long as you have passion, a love of discovering, and an open mind.
The movie incorporates footage from history in outer space and was shot on-location at the Space Camp in Alabama. For science-lovers, this movie is the ultimate ""Easter egg"" hunt, where geeks will want to shout and announce to other viewers, ""That's the actual footage of landing on the moon!"" or ""I've been on a moon-gravity simulator just like that!"" I found myself thinking that if I could go to a Space Camp that looks even half as fun as the one in the movie, it'd be the best summer of my life.

I recommend this movie for all ages, especially for aspiring scientists. I give it four out of five stars. ""Space Warriors"" will inspire viewers to look up and rekindle an excitement for learning about the unknown universe of space. Learn more about a world outside our own that we've barely begun to discover and catch ""Space Warriors"" on the Hallmark Channel, airing May 31!

2024119,3,6304282540,"WARNING: HERE THERE BE SPOILERS!
The extras on this DVD are good, lots of film of Space Camp for anyone interested in the experience or for someone who's been there who wants to show others what it looks like.
The movie itself it more or less a 90-minute advertisement. They had just wrapped on the filming when I was there for the first time (some things were still sitting around from the filming), so it's a good time-capsule for when I was there. This is the primary reason I bought the DVD.
While I am glad I got a copy, it's really a so-so movie, overall, but I expected this. I'm no fan of the `Hallmark channel' type movies, they're cookie-cutter fare with some of the worst writing and acting ever. With full cooperation of Space Camp, they could have made such a better movie than this. Anyone who's been to Space Camp in person will see all kinds of confusing things being done. It's best to see this movie with people who've never been there, otherwise you'll hear the phrase, ""We never did that,"" many times.
Beats me where they found these actors, but I think casting started off with the premise of, ""Let's find the most annoying child actors we can get,"" with the possible exception of the girl pilot. I found myself hoping that the Chinese kid and the redneck mechanic were accidently blown out an airlock without space suits early on in the film. And the 'bad guy' team people? I think the director watched too many 1980s movies and really went over the top in how they were portrayed. I mean come on, nobody has a smile like that every minute (If I knew someone who smiled like that all the time, I'd think he was psychotic, which that character clearly was).
They played fast and loose with the overall premise of space camp (just like the original 1986 movie) and some of the details were very odd. So there was an effort to go all over the world, telling kids in person they'd been accepted to some kind of scholarship program? The 1986 movie also pushed the whole, 'competition' angle and how hard it is to get into Space Camp as if anyone can't just register and show up. Anyone who's been there knows better.
Every team is dressed differently, I guess for the audience to differentiate between them? In real life, everyone dresses the same if they're all in the same program. I also couldn't quite get over how Space Camp movies have to have real astronauts as trainers for some reason when that never really happens. The teenage girl flying military drones (at a top-secret `black ops' base, no less) with a hobby-shop RC controller was pretty silly. I tried not to laugh at the idea that the pine forest background of the back fence at Space Camp was standing in for Creech AFB. In real life, that's in the middle of the Nevada desert!  Or how about a kid who's already a tour guide at the center being allowed to participate in a Camp contest anyway?
I get that the kids came up with a fix for the ISS but I couldn't accept that there was no other similar effort going on in every NASA facility at the same time. You'd think some mention could have been made where Danny Glover could have said, ""Teams working over at Redstone and Houston haven't come up with a more viable plan than the ones these kids thought up, so let's do this.""
And the winner of this competition was to go into space, right? So why wasn't that mentioned at all at the end when the team did win? Did that suddenly get yanked out from underneath them? At least the original `Space Camp' movie had a somewhat more realistic overall scenario (sitting in on an engine test that went way bad) than the winning team actually going to the International Space Station. What parent would sign those waivers and permission forms?
Okay, all the gripes out of the way, they really showed off the facility quite well. One of the annoying things about the 1986 movie to me was how little of the real Space Camp got used. This film used almost every facility on the property, and the photography was quite good. It put a smile on my face seeing all this stuff again and it made me want to go back there again. Which, I guess, was probably the entire idea. In that sense, it does a great job.
I would assume that starting this year, a new crop of young campers will have been motivated by this film. Let's just hope none show up thinking they're going to compete to actually go into space!
A good writer someday could easily come with a compelling, interesting and realistic Space Camp movie script. I'm still holding out for that someday. But this wasn't it...",1369785600,4,4546,4.4573829531812725
2024120,5,6304282540,"Just saw this movie at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center where a lot of the filming was done. What a GREAT family friendly movie. Okay, the acting is ""okay"" and a couple pieces of the plot are out of order and yes, it is hard to figure out some people's actual job. With all that aside, it is a GREAT movie. What makes it great?
1. The entire family can enjoy it. No foul language, no mushy love scenes, and there are parts that are exciting and funny enough that even adults will have a good time.
2. The ""mean kid"" isn't so cruel that you hope he falls dead; yes, he is a jerk - but not too big of a bully.
3. The movie is fun, even though it's for the kids - I never felt like poking my eyes out just to make it stop, which tends to happen with movies just for kids.
4. Finally a movie for average, ordinary kids in the 6 - 12 category. This movie is safer than Space Camp (which has a bit of language), but still has cool up-to-date technology. It's just going to let kid's have a good time.

Now, don't get this movie if you are a former Space Camper and want to relive your experience - it will just make you mad. They combine activities from Space and Aviation Camp and throw in things that don't happen in any camp (including the new Robotics Camp). Don't get this movie if you are a space buff that cringes when people get things wrong - there is a LOT that is wrong, not plausible, and ridiculous even to imagine. However, if you just like space and enjoy a fun movie that allows you to defy logic (like NASA picking future astronauts based on how they do as a team at Space Camp) - then this movie is for you.

What makes it a 5 is the synergy of all the parts. Every part taken alone ranks 3 1/2 - 4; but put together the parts work just right to make this a 5. Honestly, I left the movie and came right how to pre-order the DVD.",1368230400,18,1840,3.9972826086956523
2024121,5,6304282540,"When we first moved to San Antonio I was 11 years old. IT was 1999 and I didn't know what anime was. But I loved watching VHS's this was before dvds came out. When my daddy left me to go back to El Paso to get my momma and our stuff (We had to move in the middle of the night...so me and daddy left one day and he went back to get my momma and everything we left behind! At that time I had to stay with my aunt and my Memaw for a week without them) I was soooo lonely so my memaw took me to a place called Block Buster...We didn't have one of those in El Paso mind you. I looked around picked up a unicorn cartoon I think it was called the last unicorn. Then I came across this movie. I don't know why I picked it up I guess I just loved the cover. SO I took it home and watched it. I feel in love with it. It was a great movie I watched it ten times with in the week I had it (Five days rental at the time) once a month memaw (because we lived with them for about 2 months) or dadddy (when he came back) would take me to BB and I would check out this moive everytime... I loved it. This was before Laptops too and I didn't have a desk top computer I was too young so I coulnt get on the Internet to buyt it. When I was about 14 years old I noticed that when we went to BB to check out movies there were no VHS anymore only what I called disc...or cds...(I didn't know they had changed because I was in the hospital for two months) I looked all over for the movie and i asked the man if they had it he said sorry we sold all the VHS's we are now only renting dvds...Ever since then I have been looking for this movie I coudnt recall the name or charcthers in it because I went through some bad times. But I remembered some of the scence and I just kept looking Space Warriors was the only title I knew but I coud never find this VHS on amazon or Ebay when I finally got my own computer. I so thought it went by a diffrent name. Im now 23yrs old and I finally found the VHS I so disperatly looked for, for years. Cant wait to get it in my hands and watch it. Anime back then and now is pretty diffrent. everything is so colorful now and anime back then was ummm just diffrent. Tkae Sailor Moon its diffrent then the new upgraded Lion king 2...but I enjoy this movie Im going to buy it and watch it again and again...If you like classic anime get this movie I also recenetly found out this is also called Locke the Superman: Lord Leon OVA...turns out there are three of them diffrent ones out.

2024131,1,6304282540,"When compared to the movie ""Space Camp"" (1986), ""Space Warriors"" is an embarrassment to NASA, the Space & Rocket Center, Space Camp, and everyone involved in it's production. Too many technical inaccuracies to count, for starters. The idea that some kind of Space Camp competition would award a trip to the space station is laughable. At least in the 1986 movie, the kids going to space was an accident and due to the accident they had to work together without adult help to save themselves. In this movie, there is another crisis, but this time the kids come up with the solution and for some reason NASA entrusts the kids to enact the solution even though there are 3 astronauts lives at stake? I might have been able to live with that if it weren't for previously mentioned numerous technical problems with the dialog/script. And don't get me started with the lame ""golden ticket"" montage to get the kids to Space Camp to begin with.

2024139,4,6304282540,"Don't be fooled by the picture on the DVD box- Space Warriors is most certainly a kids movie.

It's about a group of kids that enter a space camp and eventually have to help save the lives of astronauts who are aboard the Intentional Space Station.  For a while the kids go through all kinds of training exercises after we're introduced to each of the kids area of expertise pertaining to their space shuttle abilities.  Poor Thomas Horn (the main character of the movie)- his mother won't let him join the space program because of an accident that occurred in the family years before, so he has to sneak off and enter without his parents permission.  Thomas meets a girl with glasses that he likes intimately.  They hit off a great friendship and eventual relationship.  We later discover that she too is there under shaky terms lying about her age.  However neither of them are actually kicked off the program.

Of course since Space Warriors is a kids film, there's clichd writing concerning their opponents who are basically much bigger and initially smarter/more knowledgeable bullies, so Thomas and his fellow space friends have to contend with them.  For about 30 minutes in the beginning I seriously thought Space Warriors was going to be a really awful movie.  There was nothing interesting taking place in the writing, the comedy felt forced and hokey, and the way the kids were introduced left a lot to be desired.  It does improve however.  The truth is this film is intended for kids, so as an adult it's hard for me to judge or criticize the movie since the point of view of a younger person would probably be different from mine.

Anyway the writing does improve.  Once the kids are given a chance to put their skills to the test and save the lives of the astronauts who are potentially headed for disaster, the writing gets better.  Most of the kids are memorable with their own personalities.  Obviously Thomas is the odd one out because he's apparently only at this space program based on a writing assignment he submitted, and not for a more important reason related to understanding the mechanics of building a space rocket.  This means everyone -including his own teammates- don't want him around until later on when he proves he's more than capable of being a part of the team.

It still seems odd that Thomas' mother who initially was so adamant on her son never joining a space program as a means of protecting him, would suddenly turn around and not mind at all especially given how he disobeyed her by running away from home.  Granted she was informed that astronaut lives are at stake so she didn't have a choice, and she realized what her son was capable of based on his skillset, but perhaps she should have been given more writing.  Overall decent movie.",1441411200,,2784,4.677618069815195

NASA let Space Camp offer a trip to space for the winning team of a competition. A Space Camp councilor offered the main character ( a child prodigy) and his future team a trip to space camp, but when the main character's mother found out about the winning team getting an actual trip into space she refused to let him go. The main character than claimed he was going on a fishing trip with his dad (who for one reason or another lived somewhere else (don't know if the parents were divorced or if he lived somewhere due to his work)and snuck off to space camp. He determined to win the trip to space. At the same time astronauts and cosmonauts  were having a life threatening problem on the space station. An older team sabotaged the main characters team in the final event and shortly after his parents find out that he tricked them and came to get him. His space camp councilor found out about the problem on the space station and and through him the main character found out about it. The main character  hatched a plan to save the astronauts and cosmonauts and told his team leader about it. The team leader started to be convinced and new someone at the mission control fore the space station and convinced him that the main character and his space camp team could help. They linked the simulators to the actual space station and robotic astronauts to do the work while the astronauts and cosmonauts conserved as much of the remaining oxygen as they could. through the robonauts and other remote controlled equipment that was linked to the space camp simulators, they bought the astronauts enough time to be rescued. Even though the older team had more points (due to them cheating in the final event), because the main character and his team did save the lives of everyone on the station they were declared the winners of the competition and where scheduled to be on an actual trip into space.

2024150,2,6304282540,"I was getting ready to give this movie to a co-worker who has several young boys and one long-suffering young daughter.  I was ga-ga over space stuff when I was kid, and I hoped they would be.  But this is a very traditional family, and I found some of the plot line that they would not appreciate.

First, it appears the mom and dad of the main kid in the movie are divorced, and time-sharing the son.  This may have been the only way they could fit in the fact that the son lied big-time to his mother that he was fishing with his dad, then in fact he was competing in this space camp.

The parents seemed fine with each other and, at the end of the film, seemed very comfortable.  But I would have preferred to see an intact family and  I'm sure the co-worker would have picked up on this as well. He would not want his young children to view what we used to call a ""broken home"" as the norm. Of course, it did show that divorced couples are not ""bad people.""  And it did allow them to enable the kid to put one over on his mom.

And the kid only got grounded for one month (at each parent's home, BTW) for lying to them big time.  Another unfortunate lesson.

There were good lessons as well in the film, but the ""normalization"" of what a family is and tiny consequences of deception are not things I liked seeing.",1421280000,,1318,4.149606299212598

2024176,1,6304282540,"We just watched this movie with our sons, aged 11 and 8. Then I had to spend another half hour or so explaining a number of ridiculous technical inaccuracies in the film pertaining to the ISS, telecommunications, orbital mechanics, etc. for instance, in the beginning of the film, two ""communications"" satellites collide at right angles to each other, spraying debris in all directions. Later in the film, a cluster of these fragments flies past the ISS in a tight formation along parallel paths. Telecom satellites are generally in geosynchronous orbit, 22,500 miles above the equator and stationary with respect to the earth and each other. Even if one happened to explode, the chances of a fragment hitting the ISS would be vanishingly small, considering the nearest approach between the two would be in excess of 22,250 miles, and a tight cluster of fragments would be impossible. That's only one example, but suffice it to say that this movie bent the needle on my b.s. meter beyond recognition. If you want to make a movie to get kids interested in science, you should 1) hire a technical advisor, and 2) listen to what he or she has to say! Filling the film with implausible ""facts"" like doing a barrel roll with a "" million pound"" space station by remote control just leads to misunderstanding later on. Any kid who was already interested in space would turn this turkey off by 30 minutes in, and any kid who gets turned on to science by watching this flick is going to have a lot of unlearning to do down the road. The one star rating is for the laugh I got out of the two foot long lever on the outside of the space station which activates the life support system (and also because there is no zero star option)",1388016000,,1721,4.609120521172638
2024177,5,6304282540,"I got this for my grandsons, ages 9 and 12.  We watched together.  It is a bit slow, etc. compared to the ""Marvel"" movies, but, they watched it all and really enjoyed it.  They asked questions about space camp.  Lots of good info in the movie, and amazing real technology as well as some future in the making.",1384300800,,309,4.275862068965517
2024178,5,6304282540,"I'll start this review by saying that there is no way NASA or the other nations of the world would put the ISS in the hands of kids from space camp or otherwise - but this is a great movie for those who can overlook that fact.  The movie is fairly fast-paced and not much of a dull moment anywhere.  All I can say is we liked it.  I love the original Space Camp movie.  In fact, I believe that is what will be playing at our house in 3..2..1..",1381190400,,443,3.888888888888889

2024181,5,6304282540,The kids Loved this movie. Not too scary for little ones and enough excitement for the older kids. There was some lying and cheating by the kids in the movie but the movie included the consequences for those actions.,1379808000,,216,4.564102564102564

2024184,3,6304282540,"This was a ""spin-off"" of the film ""Space Camp"" - which was well done compared to this one: better drama, goldfish bowl - kids in space by accidental lift-off. Kids don't go into space this time. they just help out the crew to show they ""have what it takes"" to be ""ground control.'  Yea, Space Camp was better. It showed total fantasy: kids have what it takes to go into space and return safely as heros! Yay for kids! This film lagged in places. If you can find Space Camp - rent that one instead.",1376179200,9,497,4.231578947368421
2024185,4,6304282540,"This is by no means a great movie, barely even a good movie as far as the acting and storyline go, and I hope the pricing for a new DVD is a misprint (at $3,897.89, can't they throw in the shipping for free?)...I rented it from Red Box for $1.20, new.  But with all of its drawbacks, including some pretty abominable acting by the child stars, I still really enjoyed it.  And I think the intended audience--the age and type of child who would be interested in attending the real Space Camp--will forgive everything else about it and just geek out on the cool introduction to what's now going on in our space program.

As Glover's character in the movie says, a bit pontifically, at one point, the space program that was formerly so robust, such a source of national pride and accomplishment, is now in danger of fading almost completely away.  This is a mistake on many levels, and while this is a highly imperfect film, the one thing it manages to do very well is capture some of the essential, exciting nature of space exploration.",1375228800,2,1033,4.508021390374331

8016243,1,6304282540,"Stereotypes aplenty? Check. Lots of really bad acting? Check. Unbelievable plot? Check. Major plot discrepancies and issues? We are go for launch. I really wanted to enjoy Space Warriors, but every time I thought I had finally coaxed myself into liking parts of the film, something else happened that took me back to hating it. Kids compete in competition where the bad kids are chastised for cheating, but the good kids cheated as well, in TWO ways. Actual space station in peril and the kids have an answer, only it involves them performing feats remotely, here on earth, that are translated to a robotic unit on the space station, so the solution can be employed in actuality. Why didn't the space crew just do what the robot did before their oxygen supply was in peril? Oh, well, then there would be no plot for the kids to 'save the day'. I love films involving space, both sci fi and real, but there has to be some tether of truth and reality that keeps you interested,especially involving a real Nasa program. Suspension of disbelief is much easier when you are entering a film that is absolute science fiction ala Star wars or Star Trek, but Space Warriors is a blended mish mash of real space program elements with a terribly convoluted fictional story and as such is an insult to real science and science fiction. See 'Space Camp' instead, its a much more enjoyable film all around.",1488067200,,1392,4.662601626016261
