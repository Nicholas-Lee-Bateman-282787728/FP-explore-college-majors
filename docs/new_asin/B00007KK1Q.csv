7978017,4,B00007KK1Q,I think this documentary was very good and shed a lot of light on Muddy's peronal life.  I do think that more footage/commentary could have been included concerning Muddy's association with Johnny and Blue Sky Records.,1473292800,,218,5.055555555555555
7978018,5,B00007KK1Q,In short if your a big Muddy Waters fan (who isn't?) you must buy this book it's got it all in spades.(no pun intended)This is certainly a must have for blues aficionados. Do yourself a favour get it.,1281484800,,200,4.2894736842105265
7978019,4,B00007KK1Q,"Over the past year I have made some effort to trace back the roots of the blues by highlighting various seemingly forgotten blues artists, mainly from the country blues branch. I have also mentioned that the huge black migration of blacks in the 1930' sand 1940's from the South to the North, mainly up the river to Chicago, called for a different kind of energy and so the blues got plugged in to reflect  that change. One would think that well before now I would have covered the great Muddy Waters, a seminal figure in that transformation of the blues. There are a few reasons what this has not been done previously. For one, I have tried to concentrate on the country blues artist, many who have been unjustly neglected. For another, I was aware that ""Cadillac Records"", essentially the story of Muddy and his relationship to Chicago's Chess Records, the key outlet for electric blues during its rise, was to be released at the end of 2008. But the main reason is that when it comes to the question of the ""King of Chicago Blues"" Howlin' Wolf is my choice and I have felt no urgency to get to Muddy's work, as important as it is to my project.

That said, this well made production highlighting the career and work of Muddy Waters is well worth the watch whatever your sympathies. As usual with these kinds of efforts there are many ""talking heads"" that inevitably populate this format. These include, importantly, various musicians that worked with Muddy over the years, like James Cotton and Charlie Musselwhite, and provide insight into his musician style, his personal habits including his womanizing and drinking, his on-and- off stage presences, a tour of various spots in Chicago where the music was made in the old days and a hint at his personality. There are also the appreciations by various later musicians influenced by Muddy, including Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton and the ubiquitous Keith Richards. Finally there are family members, girlfriends and others giving their, sometimes painful, recollections of the man.

Additionally, this film provides a running commentary through Muddy's life, of the ups and downs of Chicago blues and the artists that performed that work. We get glances of Muddy's start as a Delta artist in the late 1930's, the transformation of his work as he hits Chicago in the war time 1940's, his fight to be ""King of the Hill"", his effect on other artists, the decline of the blues with the onslaught of rock & roll in the 1950's, the revival in the 1960's and his ultimate place in the blues pantheon. Along the way we get to hear snippets of his most famous work, including ""Can't Be Satisfied"" and ""Mannish Boy"". I, personally, do not think they compare to Howlin' Wolf on ""The Red Rooster"" or ""The Killing Floor"" but this film gives those who have Muddy as number one in their electric blues pantheon plenty of ammunition for their position.",1231718400,,2886,4.756487025948104
7978020,4,B00007KK1Q,"Good information on the older blues, with older blues, combined with the later blues and events in Muddy Water's life.",1225843200,,118,4.95
7978021,3,B00007KK1Q,"When you view the story of Howlin' Wolf (appearing on some cable TV channels), Martin Scorcese's blues series or even the story of John Lee Hooker, this effort pales in comparison. Too much footage was wasted on Muddy the Womanizer; honestly, I don't care. I was looking for far more of the delta-to-Chess story, concert footage, et al. And having recently caught Willie ""Big Eyes"" Smith in concert along with Pinetop Perkins (both played with Muddy), I'm far more interested in what THEY have to say versus some random mumblings by Mr. Death Warmed Over, Keith Richards. All in all, this was a disappointment.",1118188800,8,610,4.875
7978022,5,B00007KK1Q,Highly recommend this DVD to any music fan.  Gives you real insight into the kind of man Muddy was.,1104364800,,99,4.2105263157894735
7978023,5,B00007KK1Q,"Great content, very interesting.  This is for the serious blues lover, curious about the late, great Muddy's life.  It is not a concert footage DVD, although there are a few clips.
It's a fabulous tribute, told in a biographical manner- truly enjoyable!!  If you are a big fan of McKenzie ""Muddy"", you will *LOVE* this!",1089417600,8,319,4.763636363636364
7978024,5,B00007KK1Q,"I just bought this & the Howlin' Wolf Story & John Lee Hooker, That's My Story. It's about time the industry started putting this great stuff out, I give them all five stars. I just wish they were longer (less than an hour), except the John Lee Hooker 90 min. The Muddy gives us a great deal of information on the kind of man he was, and his style if you like Muddy this is well worth having.",1076803200,6,392,4.038461538461538
7978025,5,B00007KK1Q,"This DVD was the perfect compliment to the book of the same name. While more live footage would have been nice, there is plenty out there to be had. Great historical info as well as interviews with the ones who knew him. Must have for Blues fans of all stripes.",1069200000,6,261,4.24
7978026,3,B00007KK1Q,"I love Muddy Waters and was stoked about this DVD.  Unfortunately it couldn't keep me awake.  I was expecting much more in the way of concert footage.  What was there was usually chopped up with random interviews.  The smokin' version of ""Got my Mojo..."" only teased.  Very few actual interviews of Muddy.  I'm not sure it was even a good general documentary on the blues.  The best parts were listening to Keith Richards mumble incoherently...this at least provided some comic relief.",1065744000,33,485,4.91358024691358
