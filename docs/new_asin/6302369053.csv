456142,5,6302369053,This video was exactly what I wanted. I remember watching these bible stories as a child and it helped me understand the written word the Bible.,1334188800,,144,4.576923076923077
456143,5,6302369053,"I watched this growing up and it was one of my favorite things to watch. Always entertaining, great graphics (for its time) Because of movis like this I have never forgotten the story and actually got e interested in reading the story in the Bible.",1300838400,,248,4.533333333333333
456144,5,6302369053,"First, I'm not sure which movie you were watching because when David slays Goliath there is a small amount of blood as the stone from the sling hits Goliath then it doesn't show it anymore. After that David walks over to Goliath laying FACE DOWN and picks up his sword and holds it horizontally with two hands above his head to show he had slain the giant. There was NO blood ""flow as he dies onscreen"" and David does NOT cut off Goliath's head or does it even hint at him doing so in the cartoon... You may have jumped the gun when you saw the stone hit but trust me it is not too graphic for any age and is a great story and carries a wonderful message.

This is a wonderful series and I used to watch them all when I was a child. I plan on purchasing all that I can find for my children to watch. It is a fun and exciting way to introduce some of these very useful stories and ideas to them. I would suggest these movies for anyone at any age.",1278892800,6,946,4.005291005291006
456145,5,6302369053,"I wish they would hurry up and do a box set of all these, or at least release all the titles in the series. ""The Greatest Adventures of the Bible"" is a series made by Hanna-Barbera for television many years ago. There are a ton of titles on VHS and only a few on DVD. Even though they are only 30 minute episodes, the studio chooses to release one title per disc. Noah's Ark from this set is also really good. The premise of the series is that 3 young teens are on an archeological dig site in the middle east, when they discover a tomb door that sends them back in time. So they land in different biblical episodes and interact with people like Noah. It sound weird, but it is actually fun to watch the kids in the different stories and how it affects them. They do not always know what part of biblical times they are in until later in the story.  It may sound realistic but it plays well. If you think about it, if it happened what would you do? Learn and help out of course and that is what these kids do.
In this episode the teens are being held captive by the Philistines and are being put to work. One thing I like about this version is they show you what might have been happening in the Philistine camp before the battle, and the show the large size of Goliath. The teens escape and make a new friend, a shepherd named David, who saves them from a lion. David decides to join the fight of his people against the Philistines, which lead to his personal battle against Goliath. They do show blood coming from his head when he is struck by David, but not something that bothered me. All in all very entertaining.

The stories are entertaining, well animated, respectful and I recommend.
If you like bible animation, I also suggest the series ""Testament: The Bible in Animation"".",1266969600,,1784,4.322388059701493

456147,2,6302369053,"When David kills Goliath, blood spurts from his head wound and continues to flow as he dies onscreen.  I had to turn it off before David cut off Goliath's head.  I didn't finish watching it because my daughter was too upset.  This video was much too graphic for my daughter and, in my opinion, for an animated Bible video.",1172880000,8,322,4.423728813559322
456148,5,6302369053,"I bought the entire collection of this series! I started with the David story and was arogantly going to return it as I wanted to give my then 2 year old only complete bible truth. So I went to my Bible and realized that I was basing my knowledge on the watered down versions of Bible stories from my childhood. There it was (in the book of Samuel)I was amazed at how acurate the series was. (The only one that had a slight error in it was the video on the Nativity but only because of the wisemen's visit to baby Jesus not at the manger. He was already living in a home which is why King Herod killed all babies under the age of two... but I believe the makers wanted to get the full story in the 20-30 minutes of the video... smile) The entire series is a great success and my daughter, now nine, still enjoys them and is a mini Bible Scholar. The Pastors are baffled with her Bible acuracy and comprehension. My hat goes off for the entire series! God Bless",1097366400,3,960,4.166666666666667
456149,5,6302369053,"My son is watching this video right now. Laughing and giggling is coming from his room.  This series is one of his favorites. (of course if Scooby Doo went back and met Jesus... oh forget it) Not a reading fan, I thought if I got him videos on bible stories he'd learn them. I was right. It worked. These videos are an excellent way to draw a child into the bible while he actually enjoys a fun and exciting that story he can feel a part of.  They're a wonderful supplement to a child's biblical education.",1014076800,4,506,4.260416666666667

456161,1,6302369053,"I realized the purchasing of older VHS tapes might be risky because of their age and condition. However, when I purchased the set it was noted they were in good condition. I've played two of them so far. Both have been damaged. The set was costly and obviously not worth the price.",1394582400,,281,4.423076923076923

The movie is old, but nice for kids and not get tired because its duration is 24 minutes. My nephew is 4 years old and liked her. It adheres to the Bible literally but the message is well explained.

456168,4,6302369053,I remember these from childhood and they are just as good as I remember. My daughter cannot get enough immediately after watching The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible: The Miracles of Jesus she asked to watch it again. I've found them to be very close to scriptures and even having the teenagers transported back in time doesn't detract from the stories. I only wish all the ones I remember as a child were available on DVD.,1345420800,,433,4.636363636363637

7824860,5,6302369053,"This is one of the most accurate animated versions of David and Goliath i've seen. It's almost as good as the ""Animated Stories from the Bible"" version or the ""Superbook"" version. The time travelers are funny and act as the intended audience's eyes in the middle of biblical times, and I would LOVE if more of the series was avaiable on DVD (13 episodes were originally produced and released on VHS tape, but only 5 were ever released on DVD).
As other reviewers have pointed out, there is blood shown when Goliath is slain, but it's not that much and the rest of the episode is pretty tame, so I don't consider it a big deal. Maybe rated PG instead of G but that's all.
Besides: it has a spanish audio. That's ALWAYS a plus.",1473984000,,725,4.377777777777778

7824863,4,6302369053,"As an adult, I can't get into the literary technique of modern kids going back in time to be with David and using modern vernacular/dress and blending in perfectly with the people of another era. My 6 year old wasn't bothered in the least by that. That being said, the story was actually pretty good, but surprisingly short.",1429401600,,324,4.603448275862069
