8472978,5,B005HGDRLG,"It's rather unfair to ask for a review of a box set that contain three masterful films: El Angel Exterminador (The Exterminating Angel), Viridiana and Simon del Desierto (Simon in the Desert). So I'll rate the director, those who are familiar with his work know he is a master of cinematography, and in many aspects superior to Fellini.

Luis Bunuel was born in Spain,but the fascism of dictator Francisco Franco forced him to move to Mexico and acquired citizenship in the country, it was there where he created his masterpiece Los Olvidados (The Forgotten Ones) in the early 50's. It was the ""Epoch d'Or"", Mexico had money, ten years before the School of Medicine at the University had been nominated as the best in the world, and Mexican film directors were creating memorable movies-it was the time before international bankers and globalists took over and corrupted all politicians.

Los Olvidados is a critique of Mexico's opulence and the disregard for the poor who lived in shanty towns with the skyline of a modern and prosperous city as a backdrop; the film offers a terrible and realistic ending.

The three films offered in this set are by no means any less desirable to watch, they all are worth of the viewers time and  I would definitely recommend getting the set for your personal cinematheque.",1417737600,,1310,4.860986547085202
