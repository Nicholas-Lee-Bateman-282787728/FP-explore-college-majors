2878780,2,B000S1MIQK,I purchased this DVD for my 2 yr. old hoping to see tractors in action.  Instead both of us were bored with it within a few minutes.  Although it contains information about the history of John Deere which is probably interesting for Deere collectors this DVD is not fun for little ones.  I would instead recommend Fred Levines Farm Country Ahead DVD.  It's really entertaining and educational.,1257552000,,393,4.82089552238806

2878805,5,B000S1MIQK,"I have a 3 year old that learned his colors by tractor brands, but JD has always been his favorite.  He's an active little guy, so sitting down quietly to watch tv/movies is really just not his thing.  But this movie has him so interested he sits still throught it all.  (Nice for me!)  He has several of these JD movies and loves them all.  The narration is a little cheeky and some of it is way beyond a 3 year old, even one who loves tractors.  But my guy has learned a lot from the video nonetheless.  A great buy!",1372032000,5,518,4.069306930693069

8203896,1,B000S1MIQK,"For kids maybe ok as long as you have your headphones only listening to real music.
Use of editing techniques like making the video wavy was just nauseating . Childish post production throughout.
Could have Realy given detail and provided insight but no needs to be marketed for children.",1485043200,,288,4.8979591836734695

8203898,5,B000S1MIQK,My son is a real tractor enthusiast. He could watch these all day. He loves the music. I find it slightly irritating but ignorable. These have saved my sanity.
