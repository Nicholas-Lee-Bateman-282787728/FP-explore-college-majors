8564535,5,B000ZFJ60U,I teach Elementary Spanish and I bought this video last year and used it to teach my students about the traditional salsa dance of Cuba and Puerto Rico.  I did this with my 3rd graders and they had the best time as well as myself! The video is very well geared towards students and is very age appropriate.,1236038400,5,306,4.275862068965517
