5077553,5,B007CIQ4K8,I LOVE the WordWorld series!  Even my 2 year old loves it!  And my 5 year old nephews are actually learning how to spell from it.  This is a great series!,1357603200,,154,3.903225806451613
5077554,5,B007CIQ4K8,my husband and i think this is the best show out there for children to watch! if our child watches t.v. we would love it if she could learn something at the same time and this show allows that and we love that!,1355788800,,210,3.9069767441860463
5077555,5,B007CIQ4K8,"Seriously people!! This is the best cartoon ever created for kids!! My hubby was visiting a friend who's sister and newphew were in town. He immediately started to text me that the little boy knew all his letters and could spell small words. (Thinking he was almost 2?) I was like yeah well of course right? His mother stays home and can teach him these things but then they told us about Word World. My son has now been watching for over a year. The first episode we saw (via DVR) was Runaway O; I swear to you after that one episode playing he knew O. With every episode he has learned more and more. This show has helped me tremendously with his learning. We had already bought several things (toys and letters and such) to the point my house looks like a daycare. But my hubby and I just never had the time to work with him consistently every day between my full time work and his MBA program. But now with Word World we were able to feel good about letting him watch TV while making dinner, washing dishes, etc. Thanks so much Word World. Now they just need to create a numbers cartoon that is equally good.",1348704000,4,1112,4.3

5077558,5,B007CIQ4K8,"This is a fabulous teaching tool for anyone with little folks.  My six year old enjoys the Word World DVDs along with my two younger kiddos.  We do not have television service so we invest in educational movies.  By watching them over and over the kids retain the information.  I quiz them on the content and I am confident they are learning.  I am able to do chores around the house that I don't want ""help"" with while they watch.",1422230400,,431,4.3375

5077564,5,B007CIQ4K8,My kids love this show and was getting sick of the same dvr'd episodes.  Bought this to get a little more variety and the kids enjoy watching.  My 4 year old learns a ton from watching and I can seeing him using the concepts to spell and read.,1413590400,,243,4.041666666666667

5077568,5,B007CIQ4K8,My Son Loves Word World. Just wish the episodes were longer and only one short episode of a firetruck. They do have other episodes on the DVD.,1390435200,,142,4.296296296296297
5077569,5,B007CIQ4K8,"This, in typical word world fashion teaches kids about spelling and sounding out words in a fun way.  It's also not one of those shows that make parents want to put on headphones and read a book!  I highly recommend word world!",1379203200,,227,4.380952380952381
5077570,5,B007CIQ4K8,"I love the way WordWorld intentionally teaches literacy without my 3 year old (now 4 year old) realizing that they are intentionally teaching literacy.  He thinks it is pure fun to watch, and is really happy with himself when he can recognize and sometimes even spell new words.  On this DVD, there are 4 episodes....1. Fire Fighters to the Rescue 2. Duck Saves Spider""s Web 3. The Best Nest and 4. Caterpillar Gets a Home.  Each episode appeals to a youngster's sense of humor!",1367625600,8,478,4.666666666666667

5077573,5,B007CIQ4K8,Word world has hugely helped my son prepare for reading.  He is so excited about words now he can't wait to read.  They bring the things in life that he sees come to life and gives him an understanding that every thing has a word associated to it.,1362268800,,247,4.125
5077574,5,B007CIQ4K8,"My kids LOVE wordworld. This is an older video, probably towards the beginning productions, but we like it. They actually sound out the letter before they put the words together, which I thought was great. Highly, highly recommend this program/videos to kids. Graphics are wonderful and they help the kids learn.",1360368000,,312,5.137254901960785
