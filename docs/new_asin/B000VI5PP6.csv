2942046,5,B000VI5PP6,"YMAA provided me with a copy for review, directly from their company.

Dr. Yangs ""Shaolin Staff"" is indicative of medieval spear and halberd work, born of a time when the spear/halberd were the principal battlefield weapons, and traditional martial arts were about men closing with and killing one another with arrow, spear, sword, mace and dagger on the linear, three-dimensional battlefield. The actions demonstrated in detail within this DVD selection, reflect this linear, three-dimensional environment that was traditional warfare.

The staff used is a heavy wooden staff that has a length from the ground to the practitioners eyebrows. The fundamental footwork, coordinated smoothly with all of the staffs actions clearly inform the viewer how to manipulate this weapon with power and grace. Diagonal, vertical and horizontal striking, pronated, supinated and neutral hand position thrusting, sliding, adhering, evading, and power production are all included in the fundamentals of this video offering. Dr. Yang takes the practitioner first from a stationary position, gaining the feel for the correct procedural memory of actions, and then engages dynamic, three-dimensional movement with the staff, instructing how to generate coordinated power and accuracy, in a fluid execution of combined movements. Power and grace remain the theme, with elusive, yet direct application of the staff as a weapon and not an accessory to a judged dance.

Following the fundamental lessons, there are pre-arranged, two-person sparring drills and free sparring drills, shown at various speeds and degrees of power, such that, the viewer captures a clear idea about how to ingrain the specific skill-sets into ones procedural memory.

Finally, two formal sequences are demonstrated, which contain all the fundamental elements of combative staff work, which remains true to its original roots of medieval combat. With the rise in popularity of Western European Martial Arts, where groups are resurrecting combative elements of European medieval combat from old treatises and academic guess work, this video offers very solid, realistic actions of how long pole arms were used as weapons during this time frame. Dont let the name Shaolin deter from the fact that spears and glaives remain spears and glaives, whether from the Orient or the Occident, and the staff work in this video reflects this solidly.

Well done, Dr. Yang.",1402185600,10,2415,5.498652291105121
2942047,4,B000VI5PP6,"Aloha, I have the other YMAA staff DVD too, but this one shows the basics in a slower more comprehensive style, which is better for me. I view this DVD in slow motion and reverse it, to see the different hand techniques and body positions to move the staff. I'm progressing slowly. The DVD shows me the basic techniques, so I can progress at my own speed. I'm using the Tiger Claw Iron Staff, also from Amazon, as my training staff, so I have to go slowly. Take care of yourself.",1389398400,9,479,4.274725274725275
2942048,5,B000VI5PP6,"So I've been a big follower of Dr.yang since I was young. In fact if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have no interest in martial arts and martial history. If you like to understand weapons and learn (if you have some background in it first, or you're special) the basic under laying formula then this is for you! He walks you through the difference between the southern stick and northern stick. How each tech is applied and how to train it up. As well at the end of the DVD the form that comprises of all the said techs. Study and train hard my friends. And remember we live in a day and age where this knowledge is all around. So stop fapping and start training! Keep in mind this is Southern staff only!",1378771200,5,703,4.214814814814815
2942049,4,B000VI5PP6,"Good DVD, gives basic strikes and first form as well as two-person sequence. However students demonstrating are not 100% proficient and IMO it would be helpful for form to be explained more thoroughly. I would give 3.5 stars, but i really enjoy the teachings of Dr. Yang, and feel he is an excellent source of traditional teaching with practical roots and ultimately this DVD gives me much material to learn and work on.",1323043200,11,420,4.767123287671233

8218791,5,B000VI5PP6,"Some of the other reviews have criticized this video for showing students doing the techniques -- and not very well. News flash! Perhaps Dr. Yang knows what he's doing! OF COURSE when the students do the techniques, they don't do them quite right. Precisely -- these students are making the common mistakes *I* am likely to make. Immediately after the student demonstrations, Dr. Yang follows up with an explanation of what they aren't doing quite right and how to correct it. And his remarks about WHY there are different length staves, some of the history behind staff fighting, and WHY techniques are done the way they are are also marvelous.",1470614400,5,645,4.872727272727273
8218792,5,B000VI5PP6,"This is a great dvd for practicing the staff,. Drills are included. The dvd also goes into the relationship between staff and spear, The production values are high, as they always are from YMAA..",1412553600,,195,4.764705882352941
8218793,5,B000VI5PP6,"Shaolin Staff Basic Sequences gives an excellent overview of basic staff skills, including blocking, parry, and striking movements that are fundamental to most any martial art staff training (or even medievel combat training as a few reviewers have mentioned). The weapon demonstrated in particular is the qi mei gun, or ""eyebrow height"" staff, which is comparable to what many call a ""bo"" staff.  The 180 minute DVD presentation begins with an overview of different types (lengths) of staffs that are common to the Chinese martial arts.  This is followed by basic handling, then simple movements combined with footwork. These in turn are then incorporated into practice drills.  Later, two-person practice drills are demonstrated.  The first basic staff sequence and 2-person matching set are also shown.

In what is quickly becoming a YMAA hallmark, Dr. Yang and his students present these basic techniques and drills in an easy-to-follow, and rational step-wise format.  As a 16-year practictioner and instructor of Chinese martial arts, including the staff weapon, I couldn't help but to jump away from my laptop and try a few of the drills myself.  I will certainly encorporate many of the training techniques into my own class for my students benefit.  Likewise, I firmly believe that this instructional DVD will be insightful for any martial arts practitioner and instructor.

For those that enjoy this DVD, I would also recommend Staff Fundamental Training - Tai Chi and Shaolin Techniques, by Dr. Yang.",1411862400,8,1511,5.2625

 Excellent video! This video is meant for the intermediate student of long weapons. I have been practicing the staff for 4 years and am still considered a beginner. There is wonderful history and instruction here and I am learning so much about technique. I find it very helpful to stop and replay each segment of movement until I am comfortable with what Dr. Yang is teaching. I also like how you can hear him correcting the participants in the video as they are demonstrating each movement because that is making me pay closer attention to how I am holding my body as I follow along. I highly recommend this video for all levels of students in long weapons.

8218795,5,B000VI5PP6,"Being trained in Japanese bo staff, it's nice to see the Chinese version of the same basic weapon system.  I always enjoy Dr. Yang's brief history lessons, especially when he talks about the reason for the different lengths of staffs being used in different parts of China.  (I won't spoil it for you, but it makes perfect sense of inventiveness coupled with ingenuity.)

Also, Dr. Yang does more instruction that on Staff Fundamental Training (which was ok but not great).  This provides the basic foundation of the short staff which I am more familiar with.  Good explanations, good demonstrations, good drills.",1408838400,,613,5.02970297029703
8218796,5,B000VI5PP6,"One of the weapons a martial artist needs to tackle is the staff. Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, has pulled together a very watchable and understandable 180 minute DVD instruction titled Shaolin Staff: Basic Sequences. This video training breaks into three lessons. Yang begins with the fundamentals, showing the different kinds of staffs, from what region of China they originated, and why. He moves on demonstrating the essentials of the long weapon use, beginning with the simple movements and increasing to the first basic staff sequence called Qi Mei Gun.

No matter which branch of martial arts a viewer is learning, watching Shaolin Staff: Basic Sequences is very beneficial. Also, Dr. Yangs teaching style is pleasant, understandable, and valuable. This would be an important addition to any schools or martial artists library. It is with pleasure that I recommend the DVD.

Thanks to YMAA Publications Center Inc. for the free copy of the DVD used for this review.",1403654400,3,964,5.173076923076923
