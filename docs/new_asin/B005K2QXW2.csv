4714822,5,B005K2QXW2,"A very easy DVD to navigate, and a totally pumping job by NFL Films music mixers(which I believe includes insertions of audio from the London Philharmonic Orchestra?)....I think I have watched the Game 11 Highlight against the Packers about ten bazillion times...(the part when Johnny Greer gets done with the replay decision until the end is the best EVER in surround sound)and even though they lost to the Saints the following week...I LOVE THE MIXDOWN TRACK AUDIO BACKGROUND!!...EXCELLENT!
Yes...it's true that the ""game"" chopped up that was included was not the full blow entire 3 plus hour telecast...but would you rather have Madden talking about nonsense, or the crisp, concise, exited voice of the Bucs, Gene Deckerhoff calling the historic moment of the Pewter?!  I highly reccommend this DVD for those that love audio/video presentations of sports...even if you are not a Bucs fan like me!",1059782400,2,899,5.157534246575342
4714823,2,B005K2QXW2,"I wanted to catch the entirety of the SUper Bowl over and over again and a week before Super Bowl 37 was ever played, I had ordered the DVD for the memories.
Yet problems mounted when I finally got my DVD.  First off, the package is mislabled (which Warner Brothers can only apologize for in their corporate blindness) as being Close Captioned for the hearing impaired.  It's not.  Secondly, you are told that the entire Super Bowl is contained on this disc...  It's not.  It's an edited down version that cuts most of the drama away from the game in an attempt to let them add extra features to the disc.  The audio during the game varies  from Tampa Radio to Oakland Radio, which gets annoying, instead of John Madden / Al Michaels as the broadcast of the SUper bowl was.
For a Bucs fan, this disc is just icing on the cake of having a championship.  For a DVD Fan?  This leaves a LOT to be desired.  I don't want a re-packaged review of the season from NFL Films as is included on the disc as-so-much the entirety of the Super Bowl broadcast.  Most reviewers and fans may love the disc, but I find it sorely lacking.",1057708800,3,1119,4.331730769230769
4714824,5,B005K2QXW2,The best sports DVD ever. The best part of the DVD is the special features section. The EDGE NFL Matchup pregame and postgame is amazing. This DVD is a lot better than last year's Patriots DVD(except for the HALFTIME SHOW portion with U2)... I would recommend getting this DVD for any sports fan.,1055376000,3,296,4.60377358490566
4714825,2,B005K2QXW2,"This is a DVD that could have and (in my oppinion )should have offered a lot more for the average football fan to view. NFL films does a great job of recapping the Bucs Run To Glory but we see nothing about the Raiders or any other team for that matter. It would have been nice to have added even a snippet of the other playoff games, and how can you have a SuperBowl DVD without any footage of the half time show. The actual game is only shown in  fast highlights. There where a few nice extra features such as a behind the scenes look at the events going on in San Deigo on Super Bowl week, but over all I was very disppointed with this DVD.Hopefully Next Year we will get the Full Uncut Game with some Decent Extras, like the Biggest game deserves.",1046908800,3,751,4.1438356164383565
4714826,3,B005K2QXW2,"This is a OK Dvd especially if your a Bucss fan like me but as I am watching this Dvd I got the sense that it could have been more than just Ok. The documentary that highlights every game from the season is ok and so are the rest of the features but why not some interviews with the players after the Superbowl some day or why the Buccs homecoming and the parade ?
You got a lot of space on a Dvd and it has not been taken advantage of. Especially player interviews could shed some light on how it is to win a Superbowl and how the players react after that win. The parade would really round off the season and you could see the fans going nuts after finally winning a championship. To bad NFL Films, try harder next time.",1045699200,3,722,4.055944055944056
4714827,4,B005K2QXW2,"I love the DVD as a Bucs fan but several aspects of the  Editorial Review are wrong:
""The 2003 release will contain an unprecedented 3 full hours of Super Bowl coverage including every series from the game as originally broadcast""-- Not true. Several ""meaningless"" series have been edited out of the game, the Raiders last possession of the first half is gone for example. I belive one entire Bucs series is gone as well. Also not true the ""as broadcast bit"". While some series are missng entire plays have been excised at various points- punt and kick returns are often gone for example. Also, you get the football [in fast forward] view of the game with all the huddling up parts gone. This isn't bad unless you wanted to hear more of the audio from the broadcast teams when they do analysis in between plays.
""See every series of the game as broadcast on national TV, with AFC and NFC radio broadcast overlay"" Also wrong. In addition to not being as broadcast, only the Bucs radio track is on the disk. I really wanted to hear the Raiders announcers crying over their defeat but won't get that joy.
In sum, many of the features that I wnated to get aren't on this disk but, if you are a Bucs fan, it is well worth having to relive the glory of the game, albeit chopped up.",1045267200,9,1275,4.425531914893617
4714828,4,B005K2QXW2,"When the description said ""audio commentary,"" I took that to mean that maybe you could switch between the AFC and NFC radio broadcasts.  I've bought NFL DVDs where you can do that.  And maybe even have a third audio track for the TV broadcast.  But, the AFC and NFC radio broadcasts are on ONE audio channel with no John Madden and Al Michaels around.  So, don't throw away that your VHS recording of the Super Bowl just yet.
On the positive side, you DO get virtually EVERY play of the Super Bowl (I think they might have skipped some punts which didn't affect the game, which is good).  So, the whole game is edited to a little under an HOUR.  Also, the NFL Films version of the whole Tampa Bay season also clocks in just under an hour.
Also, as a ""student"" of football, I also liked the pre and post-game shows which broke down plays and explained what happened.  Ron Jaworski and Merrill Hoge are good at doing their homework.
There's also a couple of other documentaries about media day and international broadcasts of the Super Bowl.
Not a spectacular sports DVD (I'm not sure if it exists yet) but a pretty good one (if you're not a Raiders fan).",1045094400,8,1153,4.436018957345971

4714860,1,B005K2QXW2,It cracks me up reading what you bandwagon Buc fan's posted on here. We all know the Raiders had the better Team and it took a former Raider Coach to win this game. If you did not have Coach Gruden you would of been pounded by Gannon's passing attack.....Raiders will be back and the Buc's will never see another Superbowl so enjoy this dvd now selling for $1.00 on this site. The Raiders have 3 Superbowls and have been there 5 times so not a huge deal. Our fans our loyal as I see now in 2010 Buc fans are nowhere to be seen....,1292889600,,530,4.105769230769231
4714861,4,B005K2QXW2,"I have seen many a Super Bowl, but in my young age i could not be seen in one place more than a minute and that includes watching TV. This was the first Super Bowl where i sat and watched the whole thing. Now i hate the Raiders so i could not have been more happy with results as its also the Buccaneers only League Title.

The Documentary is a revealing 3 hours long so all bases are covered. As the other reviewer said, some of the info is off. But in hole it was great watch and an awesome game.",1221004800,,498,3.9306930693069306
4714862,5,B005K2QXW2,If you have been a Buccaneers fan this is DVD for you.  Showcases the whole season. The Super Bowl broadcast is great cause it uses the Bucs announcers.,1200182400,,152,4.428571428571429
4714863,5,B005K2QXW2,"awesome dvd. Gruden's first year as coach, John Lynch and Sapp as leaders. Watching it brings back all the emotion of 2002. Go Bucs!",1167782400,,132,4.541666666666667
4714864,1,B005K2QXW2,"When you do a search for Shania Twain this video pops up. I can't even find her in the half time show. Is there a football player with the same name? She is the greatest female vocalist of all time and is much prettier than those football players, but I am sure she doesn't play football. LOL",1119052800,5,292,4.140350877192983
4714865,5,B005K2QXW2,"to the last person who reviewed this and bought it for shania twain, why would you waste money on the chance of seeing a five minute lip synch from shania twain? Dont buy a football dvd looking for country music. AS far as the DVD goes, totally awesome. But you have to have the other DVD to go with it that came with the Bucs 2003 yearbook. This dvd covers all the on the field action and almost brings a tear to my eye watching the BUcs shut down the vet and pummel the raiders. The book/dvd covers all the partying and off field antices. GET EM BOTH ASAP!!!",1075420800,4,560,4.146788990825688
4714866,1,B005K2QXW2,I bought this DVD on the basis that Shania Twain performed the half time show. Even when i did a search for Shania Twain this DVD was listed - INCORRECTLY - as there is NO Shania performance on the DVD. As far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the UK and know nothing about American Footbal - sorry!!!,1072483200,14,326,4.030769230769231
4714867,4,B005K2QXW2,"I love the content (highlights, commentary, etc.), and the bonus features. Watching the super bowl without commercials and without huddles was a bit dizzying. I wish this had been released in a widescreen version, as the 4x3 DVD's are a bit dated, and don't work well on my 57"" widescreen TV. All in all, a good DVD, but it could have been better.",1062979200,3,347,4.523809523809524
4714868,5,B005K2QXW2,"Great DVD!  Yes they did cut down the broadcast, but I taped that.  It was great to hear Deckerhoff's version of the game.  I also thought the mix from Tampa Radio to Oakland radio was a neat touch.  The highlights portion of the DVD starts at the real beginning..the Bucs loss to Philadelphia the year before in the playoffs.  All the games are highlighted and the DVD has expanded highlights and a lot of good sideline conversations in the playoffs.  Remember that this is a BUCS DVD, not an NFL season review DVD.  It's all Bucs and it's all great!",1060214400,4,551,4.45
