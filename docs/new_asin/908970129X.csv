7901513,1,908970129X,This is absolutely one of the most poorly prepared and edited dvds I have ever ordered from Amazon. The scenery is not only disappointing but very poor quality. The montage is lacking in cohesiveness. The sound is barely adequate. Do not waste your money.,1326067200,5,255,4.818181818181818
