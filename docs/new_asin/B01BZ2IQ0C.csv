8751947,5,B01BZ2IQ0C,"Love it, particularly ""Pas de Dieux,""  It's wonderful to see Iron Lady Claude Bessy's reworking of her great friend Gene Kelly's ballet that he created for her at the Paris Opera. Lovely homage in every sense of the word.",1512950400,,221,4.666666666666667
8751948,1,B01BZ2IQ0C,"The Gene Kelly was movie choreography.  In my dictionary that is a pejorative term.  The other nonsense isn't worthy of serious consideration.  What really got my goat is that the camera work is the best I have ever seen.  What a shame the dancers didn't merit such perfection.  Well-schooled but sadly lacking in every other way.  I've paid my dues as a balletomane, so I don't deserve this one.",1473724800,,396,4.666666666666667
8751949,2,B01BZ2IQ0C,Disappointing.  The Gene Kelly piece did not seem substantive enough.  The second piece was just pleasant but boring.,1469577600,2,117,5.444444444444445
