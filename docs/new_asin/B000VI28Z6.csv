The story lines although mature, they are not over the top. The violence is apart of any super hero movies, yet not too graffic. My now 9 year old son will enjoy watching the movies many times over.",1199059200,,329,4.5
2941880,5,B000VI28Z6,We purchased this for our kids as a Christmas gift.  They are superhero junkies.  It is an excellent value for the 2 movies.  I recommend it to everyone.,1198627200,,153,4.392857142857143
2941881,4,B000VI28Z6,"Short resumed Director Tim Story has done an excellent job with the film adaptation of the Marvel super-hero gang The Fantastic 4. He brought on a terrific cast, used some great special effects and made a couple of movies that the whole family can enjoy together.

The criticism for the Fantastic 4 series seems to center around two similar objections. 1) Fans of the comic books are dissatisfied with the less intense film adaptations. And 2) The series is too light and family oriented. Indeed, those are valid objections if you've come looking for Marvel adaptations like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blade-Trilogy/dp/B0007WFX62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blade Trilogy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daredevil/dp/B0002XVQNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daredevil</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Punisher/dp/B000I2KRZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Punisher</a>. Even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B0002XK190/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000HEVZ9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>&nbsp;trilogies far exceed Fantastic 4 in adult-oriented content.

The Fantastic 4 series holds up quite well as a family franchise. The stories are very well put together. There are funny moments and there's great action. The acting cast is good and they take their roles seriously. Sure, the movies get campy at times. But, c'mon...it's a 1960s comic book adaptation. But the modern twists and especially the modern special effects make these films thoroughly entertaining for young and old.

Fun movies, and the sequel is even better than the original.",1196208000,24,1871,8.028985507246377

2941885,4,B000VI28Z6,"I decided to get this 2-movie set version for the value and convenience.  The original Fantastic Four movie disc offers the movie in Widescreen with a couple of featurettes.  The Silver Surfer movie disc shows the movie in Full Screen format on side A and Widescreen on side B with commentary available.  While I didn't expect all the bells and whistles on the second film that was offered in the other released editions, it would have been nice to have one featurette included.
I enjoyed both movies as entertaining diversions.  The special effects are quite good.  The characters continue the first film's fun banter in the second film.  However, don't expect great depth into the characters.",1193011200,10,694,4.939655172413793

2941912,5,B000VI28Z6,"The Fantastic Four movies literally are FANTASTIC!!! A perfect cast. I loved it. They acted just like the comic book characters. Except for a little immodesty, (Susan Storm with nothing on but a bra and panties in the first film and nothing on at all (you don't see too much) in the second one. Also women wearing hardly anything at all at Reed's bachelor party. All Johnny's fault!!!) A couple rude things said by Johnny, but still two great films! Ioan Gruffudd played Reed Richards beautifully! Which I was so happy about because Reed is one of my favorites (if not). I couldn't have asked for a better actress for Susan Storm than Jessica Alba! She was awesome! She is the girl! She didn't keep up with any of those guys' crud. Michael Chiklis played very nice for Ben Grimm. I felt so sorry for him and I think they did a good job at showing what distress and what a problem he had living as the Thing. I began to like his character a lot better watching him in the films. He is such a cute and loving character (Alicia and Ben are so cute!) Chris Evans playing Johnny Storm was amazing! I know him and watch him all the time as Captain America so when I saw him play this character it completely threw me off! He was so different. He is a complete hot-head and really loves himself. But I was so happy at the end of the Silver Surfer when he gave himself up and and realized it wasn't about him. I loved the part when he took all the Fantastic Four powers! He looked amazing! I loved when Susan was getting married and he told her she looked beautiful. Even though he is this really ""I can do this by myself and I don't need a silly older sister to throw me around"", he really, truly loves Susan and you saw that especially in the second one.
Doctor Doom was sooooo well done! I was very impressed. The dude's scary! I thought bringing the whole thing of him and Susan being a thing really was interesting and a good thing to throw in. (don't worry! It didn't last! Thank goodness!) The Silver Surfer was very well done too. In the comics I find him as a sort of a Spock character and he even acted like Spock in this film.
Anyway, I thought these movies were really, really, good. Met ALL of my expectations! I am a HUGE Fantastic Four fan and these films were perfect! I didn't watch Electra and Daredevil because of the R rating and Electra seems a little strange. But I definitely say if you want to know who and about the Fantastic Four, these movies are the go to!",1454976000,,2476,4.281449893390192

2941977,3,B000VI28Z6,"I made the mistake of believing a review / ""correction"" (then at the top of the lists) which stated that there were extensive Special Features in this product -- contrary to prior correct assertions by others (e.g. ""Silver Phoenix"") who said there were almost none.  I soon found that the ""correction"" (by ""Brian T"") that I'd relied on was simply Flat-Out Wrong!
Upon receiving the factory-sealed product, I loaded it up and found that there were absolutely ZERO (0) special features on Disk#2 (""... Rise of the Silver...""):  There was ONE and Only One choice on the initial / Disk Menu screen -- ""Play [the movie]"".
Disk#1 (""Fantastic Four"") contains ONE and Only One (1) commentary track by 3 of the F4 actors. Chris Evans wasn't included, though the others made several very positive remarks about his great contribution -- including the revelation that he ad-lib'ed much of his own dialogue and, in so doing, greatly improved both the pacing and overall interest of the movie (their observation).
The only other ""extras"" in the set (all on Disk 1) were several short previews (really just ""internet"" ads) for other DVD products.
The ""correction"" that I'd relied on was Flat-Out Wrong!
I may be a bit unusual in that a big reason that I buy physical DVDs & Blu-Rays (rather than simply rely on a download service) is to get these extras.  I am, therefore, quite disappointed.
So I am now faced with trying to find a source for these ""extras"" and buying them in addition to what I've already purchased. While I haven't worked out an actual net dollar amount that this misleading review cost me, with shipping costs it cannot be totally inconsequential...  At least the movies were good.

2941992,2,B000VI28Z6,"Purchased the ""own the moments"" blu-ray two pack, some notes:

-Rise of Silver Surfer Disc was defective, will not play on either updated/web connected blu-ray player in my home.  I do not know if the two pack would have a higher defective rate than singles.  Actually i do not beleive i have ever had a blu-ray DOA.  Amazon returns are easy, just have to remember to get this in the mail.

-Packaging: The cover is just as pictured.  The ""own the moments"" label and white fields give this a cheasy discount rack look that could have been avoided.  It is a single blu-ray case that holds both movies.  If you are wondering why i'd be surprised that it looks just as it is pictured, it's because i also purchased the ""Punisher"" two-pack which contained the original two movies in original cases wrapped together with a disposable ""two pack"" insert placed on top.  This (FF) saves space, but looks cheasy.

-Movies themselves:  a quick note or two, as I assume most know what they are getting.  These are probably some of the worst major studio comic book movie adaptations in the last decade.  That also says a lot about the quality of most comic book movies recently, as they are not unwatchable in themselves.  On a positive note, they really are family friendly compared to the recent crop of excellent, but edgier, movies.  These movies are not ""Marvel Studios"" quality, but i think they are better than Daredevil and the first Punisher.  Some of us just have to have all of these super hero movies...

I'm giving this a two star recommendation to others.  I'd say the movies themselves might rate three.  This particular package/presentation gets two.  Obviously mine was defective (less than a star), but lets assume that is unusual unless other reviewers have the same experience.  I count on Amazon to make it right with me as they aften do; if you are curious i'm personally taking the refund rather than replacement.",1357516800,5,1925,4.7207207207207205

2941994,4,B000VI28Z6,"I won't argue about comic-to-film translation. Expecting things to be exact from the comic book should be ideals left at the door. This is F4 the movie, you can read the comic book at your local comic store (I encourage you to do so!). F4 is a great movie if you can expect to have a good time with a comic book film, one that doesn't take itself too serious like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor overly comedic, like The Incredibles, but somewhere between. And I think that's the tone a Fantastic 4 film should take. While I enjoyed the first movie, I have to be honest, in the theater I was somewhat disappointed with its sequel. But over time I can sit down and enjoy it for what it is. I think time does that for some movies. Its OK to change and grow your opinions!

The transfer to blu-ray disc is pleasing and fairly standard as far as transfer go, being just as vibrant as it was in the theater. These are mostly bright films, even when its dark outside. Surround sound is also pleasing enough, using a very sci-fi pallet of sounds. Extra's are on the poor side, ripping them (and the disc design) from the DVD's essentially, and I would say that brings the overall rating down to 3 stars but the fact this edition has both films I bumped it up to 4 (when I purchased the ""Own the Moments"" edition it was a steal being a few bucks over the price of just one film).

Great movies if you can just stop being so critical, grab a big bowl of popcorn and your favorite soda, and have fun. I mean, this is fun for the whole family without alienating adults in my opinion. And since the Fantastic Four is one crazy family (maybe more than some families), its a win-win.",1352160000,6,1666,4.268987341772152

I bought this off of Amazon thinking it included both movies as well as special features, but the description on here was extremely vague. This bluray set has NO special features at all, and the aspect ratio listed on Amazon is incorrect. The actual aspect ratio for each movie is: Fantastic Four (Widescreen 2:35:1) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (Widescreen 2:40:1).

I was disappointed that I have to return this as I just received it today, but if I'm buying it on bluray I want all the features.

If you're only interested in the movies then this would be great for you, but otherwise it's an unnecessary bundle when they've already had different bundles already put together. This would have been perfect if it contained everything.

Edit:

Apparently someone who purchased this set (Brian T) has posted that there are indeed special features included in this set of the Fantastic Four films. The first film contains 2 commentaries and a trailer while the second apparently has a lot of special features.

I returned this item initially because of no information given on the package sleeve about special features and many people will find themselves in a similar situation because of it. I still rate the movies as 3 stars for an average as they're good but not ""Fantastic"" yet the bigger issue is with Fox and their poor product manufacturing when it comes to information given on products.

The movies themselves are worth seeing even without the special features but you want as much content as possible for your purchase. Even Amazon doesn't list that there are any special features and that is completely the fault of this ""Own the Moments"" series.",1341187200,15,1902,5.383838383838384

The real problem is Julian McMahon as Victor Van Doom. I've always said a good movie needs a compelling villain. Van Doom's just a horrible, superficial villain. His only motive appears to be the lust for more power - so boring and cliche. He also has some of the corniest lines in the movie.
