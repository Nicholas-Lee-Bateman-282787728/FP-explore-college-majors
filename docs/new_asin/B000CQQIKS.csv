2470126,3,B000CQQIKS,"I was disappointed in the small role of Jennifer Tilly, who would have made a better lead. The dialogue was good. It was funny for what wasn't said, then what was. A man says of his daughter, ""She is still technically a virgin."" Okay, what does that really mean and why would her father know? Two grown brothers can't handle the day to day aspects of life without a mother. After attempting several times to hire a prostitute for maid service, they opt instead to kidnap a woman. Her life is so miserable, living with the unlikeable Patrick Warburton, that she decides to stay with them. Does everyone in Texas wear Buddy Holly glasses? In the typical twist, the audience roots for the law breakers. The movie reminded me very much of ""Raising Arizona,"" but not nearly as good.",1280016000,2,777,4.597122302158273
2470127,5,B000CQQIKS,"My wife and I love this movie! It is unpredictable and hilarious! I keep saying, ""So and so needs to see this!""",1255651200,,111,4.090909090909091
2470128,5,B000CQQIKS,"I finally found a copy here on Amazon.  I'd heard about this movie, but never had a chance to see it.  I'm so glad I did.  Quirky/off beat/real.  This is one of the few movies where I actually felt I was a part of the group.  I cared about each of the characters, I laughed at odd times because each scene and line would build/feed off of the others beautifully.  The music was also a surprising plus.  And I've always been a sucker for a serpentine move when getting shot at. The concurrent scene in the truck was hilarious given the kinetic frenzy going on outside and the stubborn calm inside.  Each of the character portrayals were wonderful, sad, and real. The cast conveyed their character's flaws/limitations effortlessly, and allowed me to enjoy every single one of them.  From the bad guys to the broken ones --I loved them all.  Now I'm going to have to watch it again.",1245801600,2,879,4.471698113207547
2470129,5,B000CQQIKS,"I loved American Strays, Michael Covert's first movie, and Patrick Warburton is a favorite of mine so I had to have this DVD. What a surprise to see the always excellent Tara Chocol featured as well. She was great on ER and has been one of Hollywood's undiscovered gems for the last few years. Maybe this film will finally get her the attention she deserves.  Check it out.",1149811200,2,373,4.485294117647059
2470130,5,B000CQQIKS,"A movie that I was able to get into and just enjoy, the camera work was excellent, the characters were totally believable, the story of the adventures of 2 Brothers was totally original.

Good flick, will be watching it more than once, and I'm sure going to turn my friends onto this gem.",1139270400,4,288,4.433962264150943
2470131,4,B000CQQIKS,"My first reaction upon seeing Dumber Than Dirt was that it reminded me of a musical I really love. Well, not exactly, but one of the situations. In this musical ( Seven Brides for Seven Brothers ), seven guys steal seven girls to be their wives, and while at first the girls cry and hate the boys...they end up not wanting to leave when their families come to save them. That's kind of what happens in Dumber Than Dirt. Two brothers lose their mother tragically and can't live without one. So they end up going to the grocery store and stealing themselves a new one. She ends up not wanting to leave, because the only thing she has to go back to is an abusive husband. This movie manages to take a normally serious situation and turned it into something amusing. Obviously, comedy ensues, but you'll have to watch it to find out what happens.",1138924800,3,842,4.438709677419355
2470132,4,B000CQQIKS,"Aw man, this movie's classic~ I was like cracking up the whole way, no joke. If you've ever watched that one French movie crime spree, its kinda like that, the type of humor anyway. Basically its about two country dudes and their queshey t to find a housewife that could replace the role of their mom. Along the way tgo through the most ridiculous and hilarious things. I mean the plot is simple, but the way they put it together was just too funny. If you want a good laugh this is definitely the movie to check out.",1138924800,2,517,4.285714285714286
2470133,5,B000CQQIKS,"I mean honestly, have you guys even seen this movie?

Jennifer Tilly only has about a 2 minute part in this movie when she offers her ass for $35 to the 2 men, what a steal that would be...

The lady they kidnap in this movie, DeDe, is the cute Tara Chocol, who looks to be about half of the weight of Tilly, c'mon guys...",1138838400,3,322,3.9384615384615387
2470134,5,B000CQQIKS,"I thought Dumber than Dirt was an amazing comedy way ahead of its time. Of-course you cannot forget about Mr. Patrick Warbuton who starred in cult TV shows such as ""The Tick"" and Disney's ""The Emperors New Groove"". Tilly was great too.

It's an unlikely tale of two brothers who are on the prowl for a new replacement mom; so they get desperate enough to kidnap a woman from a local supermarket. I won't spoil the entire movie, but the brothers are drawn into a scenario they didn't see coming, and it is full of outrageous laughs and discreet giggles. I absolutely loved this movie and thought it was great for all the actors and actresses.",1138320000,5,641,4.525862068965517
2470135,4,B000CQQIKS,"Dumber than Dirt isn't you're typical comedy; it takes some of the biggest problems in society and puts a funny spin on them.

The plot is about two brothers that have lost their mother, and go on this search to try and find a new one because they simply can't go on without a mom. They ended up finding this woman at a supermarket and basically kidnap her, not knowing that they've actually done her a service. The woman comes from an abusive household with a crazy husband that she doesn't want to go back to. The problem that they have to try and overcome is actually that she already has a child, and she wants to get it back from her crazy husband without getting drawn back into a relationship with him. Of course, out of this situation all the comedy comes, and it's pretty funny. They managed to take a usually dramatic satiation and find some kind of humor in it. I would recommend this movie, it's something different from most of the comedy movies that have been released recently, and it's sort of nice to have something that's set apart from all the others.",1137974400,4,1070,4.431472081218274

8100704,5,B000CQQIKS,"One of my all time favorites.  Not your run of the mill romantic comedy.  The leads were all great, Wharburton at his meanest and Luke Perry was hilarious. I bought it a few years ago and have watched it several times.",1438128000,,218,4.2926829268292686

8100707,1,B000CQQIKS,"I love Patrick Warburton, but this movie is far from a comedy and was so stupid.  I tried 3 times to watch it, and it just got worse each time.  It was horrible. Avoid it at all cost.  Like the title it is dumber than dirt - full of violence that is not funny and painful to watch.",1397174400,,281,3.810344827586207
8100708,5,B000CQQIKS,"Love the pace of this movie! these born to lose brothers get into all kinds of mischief trying to 'replace' their dead mother. They bite off more than they can chew when they kidnap a young mother that won't go back to her abusive husband, played by the great Patrick Warburton. Lots of laughs!!",1380672000,,295,4.481481481481482
8100709,4,B000CQQIKS,"DUMBER THAT DIRT (2006) Patrick Warburton, Jennifer Tilly
Rated R
Tagline: Looking for mom in all the wrong places
A quirky, offbeat, unpredictable and original black comedy, with a heart.  A virtually unknown and unexpected Indie film. Jennifer Tilly has never been sexier.
Texas rednecks, pickup trucks, white trash trailers, crooked sheriffs and ever so polite criminal activity. It reminded me of the whacked Coen brothers. Minimum profanity and no real nudity to speak of.
Not as dumb as it may sound with no lame or stale caricatures, there's some reality and real emotion here. Watched it twice, then ordered a copy for my collection.",1355270400,,641,5.104761904761904
8100710,5,B000CQQIKS,"This movie is hilarious! Burying their mom in a sleeping bag while drinking a beer, the mean sheriff, the bank jobs.. The younger brother just cracked me up!",1306368000,,157,4.642857142857143
