6898972,5,B00R4SM4LY,I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theater when I was 16. The fact that they are making a movie within a movie helps suspend your disbelief. It's Reynolds best movie after Deliverance and Smokey and the Bandit.,1430697600,9,219,4.365853658536586

6899004,5,B00R4SM4LY,Classic movie now on blu ray. It is as good as the 1st time I saw it in 78 as young kid. The transfer is good i know alot of people complain about old movies transfer to HD but im sure it is hard to get it crystal clear on a movie that was transfered from film that has been deteriorating for for almost 40 years. If your a fan of Reynolds you will love this movie. Also give Sharky Machine on blu ray a shot another 80s Reynolds classic and good movie.,1487376000,2,453,3.881720430107527

6899017,5,B00R4SM4LY,"Total silliness and fun. Yeppers, that is what ""Hooper"" is and this thumbs up to the stunt men and women in the film business. Plus, as with many of Burt Reynolds movies, a chance for him and his buddies to get together and have some fun and they do. Burt is an aging stuntman who very soon will have to hang up his spurs, too much punishment on his body. Along comes a young buck to steal his thunder, Jan Michael Vincent, I loved this movie just because you can tell that the actors are having fun. Nothing special or spectacular...just fun. Besides Burt and Jan-Michael we get Sally Field, Brian Keith and many, many familiar faces. We get the customary bar fight too. You will laugh and enjoy this movie. it is very choppy as far as the editing goes but who cares.",1468022400,3,768,4.340277777777778

6899038,4,B00R4SM4LY,"Ace but ageing stuntman 'Sonny Hooper' (Burt Reynolds) will perform almost any stunt asked of him to get the
'shot' the film-makers require, however, years of high-risk stunts has taken it's toll on 'Sonny'...the Doctors have
made it quite clear that if he continues he will almost certainly end up paralysed, there is only so much repair-work
that can be done on his battered body.
Stunt-work is a competitive market there is always someone willing to take the risk if you don't, the new generation
are younger and fitter, such a young admirer of 'Sonny's' work down the years turns up on the scene, 'Ski' (Jan-Michael
Vincent) wanting to work with the Stunt-Legend.
Trouble is, the presence of 'Ski' will encourage 'Sonny' to take more risks feeling he has a point to prove.......
When an opportunity arises for 'Sonny' with 'Ski' to earn a shed-load of money to make a near-impossible car-jump the
ageing stuntman will risk all hoping to survive and maybe make this his last stunt ??
The film also Stars 'Sally Field' as 'Hooper's' partner - 'Gwen'....'Brian Keith' as 'Jacko' also a legendary stuntman and father
of 'Gwen'....along with 'Robert Klein' as 'Roger Deal' the film director that demands increasingly dangerous stunts for his
films regardless of it's cost.
This is a fun-film experience which includes several impressive stunt-sequences telling the tale of the rivalry in what is a
often dangerous occupation................well worth a revisit.",1445040000,5,1460,5.138655462184874

6899059,3,B00R4SM4LY,"This is Burt's salute to stuntmen (and women) and is exactly what that type of movie from a mid/late 70's Reynolds should be. Broad, loud and boisterous it is Reynolds and his co-horts, including Sally Field not far from her role in ""Smokey & the Bandit"" as the main squeeze and the late James Best filling in for Dom DeLuise.  70's Stalwart Jan-Michael Vincent is the rival/frenemey and young upstart to Burt's aging star.
Lots of cool real world stunts that look somewhat tame by today's standards but there was no CGI and digital post clean up on these, so what you see is what they did.
Directed by Hal Needham (stuntman extraordinaire and long time Burt collaborator) and featuring appearances by Brian Keith, Terry Bradshaw, the great Robert Tessier this is easy, breezy no brain Saturday afternoon 1978 vintage Burt chuckle fest (Burt always looked like he was having way to much fun making movies).
