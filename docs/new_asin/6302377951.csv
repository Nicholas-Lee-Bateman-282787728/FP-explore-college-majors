7824898,5,6302377951,"This film is the first of five one- man shows that John Leguizamo has done over the years. if you liked this you'll like "" Freak"", "" Spic-o-rama"", "" John Leguizamo Live"", and "" Sexaholix."" it is so funny my freinds and I were all on the floor laughing and constantly reanacting each scene down the each movement and line, but of course no one can compare to john himself this video is the best comedy I've seen in my whole life. also there is  a bit of drama, during the Angel part of the routine but it just showcases what a true talent Leguizamo really is!!! For those of you reading this let me explain better. This is a one man show consisting of several characters played by leguizamo. it's a collection of comical monologues that are creative, inventive, and astonishingly true to life as a latin person. this film makes a statment about life but it never takes itself to seriously. be ware though that after seeing this film it will be really hard to watch other comedies knowing that Leguizamo's type of talent exists. he sets the bar really high. Everyone should see this film at least once, but if you ask me every one should own their own copy!!! buy it today and see what I'm talking about!!!",1064188800,8,1204,4.423423423423423

7824901,5,6302377951,"As a Latina of the 90's and now Millenium, I'm grateful to John for creating something so helpful to our lungs.  I laughed so hard at age 14,  and understood the comedy, which was also a plus. Now that I'm 22, it helps  me with my own comedy and conversation for that matter.  If you know it  (the show) your pretty cool. The show also helped  me to be more  comfortable with stereo-types.  Where I came from I was the only Mexican  and where I moved, I was one of a million.  Although, I would also like to  know how to obtain the other two shows Mr. Leguizamo did such as  Spic-O-Rama and Freak.  If you have any info on how I can get them into my  library of movies too, I would greatly appriciate it. Let me know when and  where I can see these items as well.  Thanks a bunch, love the shows.  Miss  Rachel Miranda.",966211200,27,819,4.075949367088608

7824903,1,6302377951,"Mambo Mouth was the worst John Leguizamo movie I have ever seen. It fails to display Leguizamo's outstanding acting ability, showcased best in The Pest. You're better off just getting The Pest, it's great.",944524800,5,205,5.0588235294117645
