1404377,5,B000059H6L,"When you have talent, a good script and remarkable cast, it is almost impossible for you not to triumph, even you make a low budget picture without great and spectacular effects that just only mesmerize to the new generation of teenagers.
There is solid story behind this plot. As you know one of the classical premises of the Noir Films is that nobody is absolutely innocent. That is why many people are beaten by this circumstance.
The presence of the captivating and seductive Natasha Henstridge from the intial shots, coming to the Used Books Tent will open Pandora' box.
Through a very well articulated mechanism of dark loyalties and hard to believe solidarities, the viewer will be engaged progressively in this drama.
A personal tragedy, a love affair, several stolen millions,  betrayal and passionate and complex web of facts and events will make of this film one of the most interesting movies in years that I 've seen.
Highly recommended.",1118966400,8,950,4.9375

1404379,4,B000059H6L,"A small low budget film with little or no publicity could join the noir greats. It has all the classic ingredients - an ice cool blonde, a bad bad gangster, and a savage twist at the end. some really interesting effects from the director with cross and jump cutting. Liked every bit of it.
I have not enjoyed a film noir so much since Blood Simple.",1037836800,13,348,4.287878787878788
1404380,3,B000059H6L,"This dark mystery/thriller begins well enough, but it gets increasingly implausible until by the end it loses most of its credibility.  Crystal Ball (Natasha Henstridge) walks into a second hand bookstore owned by Sam Kane (Angus MacFadyen) ostensibly to apply for a job.  Upon leaving, she is hit by a car.  Sam takes her to the hospital and cares for her while she recovers.  The impact causes her to lose her memory, so she doesn't know who she is or where she lives.  The two fall in love and then Crystal suddenly remembers that she was sent by Merv Gutman (Peter Fonda) to kill Sam because Merv thinks Sam stole money from him.  The film goes through a number of gyrations including confrontations between Crystal and her boyfriend Tommy G (Liam Waite), Crystal and Merv, Sam and Tommy G, Sam and Merv, Crystal and Sam, etc., etc.
The plot has a few interesting twists, but the dialogue is banal and many of the scenes drag.  However, for a film made on a $3.5 Million budget, director Darrell Roodt delivers some excellent photography and shows himself to be talented at creating powerful imagery.
If there are two things that stand out from this film, they are the talents of Roodt and Henstridge.  Roodt gives the images style and richness with interesting perspective shots and a number of beautiful location shots.  I'd like to see him get a more prominent project where he can put his talents to work.  Natasha Henstridge carries the film with an excellent performance that should portend a shot at meatier roles in the future.  Her striking appearance and superior acting ability is made even more obvious playing against journeyman Angus MacFadyen, whose performance here helps validate his relegation to supporting roles throughout his career.  MacFayden is stiff and forced, contributing little to the believability of his character.  As mediocre as MacFayden is, Liam Waite is worse.  Peter Fonda gives a nefarious performance in a minor role.
This film isn't bad for a B movie and shows twinkles on the horizon for Roodt and Henstridge.  I rated it a 6/10.  With a stronger screenplay, it could have been very entertaining.",988243200,6,2141,4.87292817679558
1404390,2,B000059H6L,"I honestly don't mean to rate this movie this low, but with so many people putting up 5 stars...  what in the world?  at best this should get a 3/5...

It's mildly suspenseful...  but it's yet another story of a guy who stole a pile of cash from Vegas and is essentially on the run...  as per the ""twists & turns""...  ummm...  yeah, sure...  I guess people here don't watch a lot of movies...  There is a little bit of ""guess who"" work in this one, but unless you are like 5, it's pretty easy to figure out...

Acting was decent...  I ""suspect"" the budget for this flick was actually quite low...  like very low...  cinematography was good, editing was good, sound was good...  but based on number of sets, special effects, and say the fact that the only car destroyed in the movie was like a 1970's FIAT...  I'm guessing pretty low budget...

If you like a dialogue driven mystery...  I ""guess"" this might be ok...  but honestly, it's lacking a lot of key elements even for that...  so 2 stars from me...",1504656000,2,1005,4.364130434782608

1404395,5,B000059H6L,"I loved this movie!  It definitely lived up to the film noir tradition, in that no one is who they seem to be and no one is an innocent party.  I was drawn into the movie from the very beginning.  The characters were entirely believable, from Natasha Henstridge as the femme fatale ""mystery woman,"" to Angus MacFadyen as the owner of a used bookstore who is harboring a dark secret, to Peter Fonda as the ruthless crime lord who is out for revenge following the death of his wife and money that was stolen from him.  Just when you think you have everything figured out, you're thrown a curve ball that puts you back at square one.  The movie will keep you guessing until the very end -- a twist of events so surprising that I had to rewind it and watch it again.",1395878400,5,762,4.263888888888889
1404396,5,B000059H6L,"If you like a slow moving plot that builds tension with twists and turns, this is the movie for you.  I didn't even know Peter Fonda was in it and he plays a deliciously evil mastermind.  What fun!",1393804800,,197,4.157894736842105
1404397,5,B000059H6L,"I really liked this movie because of the sex scenes, but I didn;t know that there was another woman involved until the end when the get the money and the girl and her kill the man, it was really interested towards the end, you have to see this movie.",1371254400,,250,4.122448979591836
1404398,3,B000059H6L,"brief plot:  a used-book store owner's life starts to gets interesting when a mysterious woman enters his life.  She is hit by a car and, when recovering consciousness, has a case of amnesia.  The store owner falls in love with her.

things get complicated when they both try to re-trace her life history.  They find her apartment, and a sack full of cash as well inside it.  He soon suspects that she is hiding something, but he has secrets of his own..

personal comments:  I'm a fan of Natasha Henstridge, so I'm a little biased in favor of this film.  Having said that, the plot twists and turns keep the viewer guessing, and a brief appearance by Peter Fonda adds to the quality of the film.

1404399,5,B000059H6L,"Having never heard of the movie before it was suggested on Netflix, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised by outstanding performances all around.

Angus Macfadyen, who has taken a few hits for his performance, gives a masterfully subtle, nuanced performance as Sam.  To compare him to other actors is to compare Baroque to Romance periods of classical music; Romance composers had more wild flair, but Baroque is appreciated in the precision, control and details.  Like a Baroque composer, Angus Macfadyen shines in the details.  He can show a vast range of emotion simply by raising a brow, tilting his chin, getting a hard look in his eyes.  If you aren't accustomed to watching people for these changes and reading those small subtleties of their mannerisms, you miss some of his greatness.  A great performance isn't always handed to you.  Sometimes you have to be invested in it but a talented actor like Angus Macfadyen makes it well worth the effort.  In the end, you find yourself identifying with his character even though he is flawed and has brought much of this on himself with his questionable former life.  He takes a character we may not like under other circumstances and makes him someone you are rooting for in the end.

It was a thoroughly engaging movie and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good thriller to add to their DVD library.",1168560000,6,1392,4.758333333333334

7933115,1,B000059H6L,"Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Absolutely dreadful. The acting was dull uninspiring. Terrible script tried to be Noir but couldn't pull that off. Too many holes in the story, if you watch it you have to suspend reality. Why is it in every movie (Most movies) guys just worship the stray woman that walks into their life and become complete morons? A guy hiding out for his life isn't going to take the risks this guy did not at all. Nothing was even slightly realistic.
The ""Twist"" just ignorant! The hit woman was a secret lesbian with her lesbian lover running her over with a car (In real life she would have died) but she winds up with her at the end of the film??? She was in a relationship with her hit man partner I think he would have known if she was a lesbian and had a lesbian lover... He was very jealous and protective of her.  Nothing adds up at all in this film. It was obviously a low budget B movie with a B movie cast. I bet this was direct to video or a cable film I can't believe it was released in theatres.
If you like Noir films, thrillers, a mystery skip this pile of garbage and watch one of a hundred quality films try TCM.",1506038400,,1136,4.163636363636364
