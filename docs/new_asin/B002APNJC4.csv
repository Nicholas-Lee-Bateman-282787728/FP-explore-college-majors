3890644,5,B002APNJC4,"This was a gift to my Grandson  Brendan Dolan who is 11 yrs old and is Down Syndrome.  He was so excited since this was the only DVD he wanted.  I also gave him the Harry Potter Series.  I give ICarly a five star.  His greatest joy is to watch DVD's.  He will watch DVD's all day if we let him.
ICarly goes to Japan is one of his favorites.

3890647,5,B002APNJC4,"My two tween daughters really love this show.  The show features Carly, a girl in her early teens produces her own web show with the help of two friends: wild and crazy Sam (as in Samantha) and the boy next door, Freddie.  Their antics on the webshow are entertaining to watch, but the real fun comes from watching these fairly typical teenagers interact with one another and their classmates.

The absolute highlight is Carly's older brother, Spencer, with whom she lives.  He is hilarious as he tries to walk the line between cool older brother and responsible guardian.

This show may be written for tweens, but it is funny enough for adults.  And a good clean show that the whole family can enjoy is a rare find indeed!",1342051200,3,723,4.609375

8359953,5,B002APNJC4,The iCarly dvd seasons are worth getting cause you get 2 dvds in one with a lot of episodes n don't let the word volume described it is a lot of episodes that's why they have a lot of volume dvds. This one has the Christmas episode I love n in my opinion this episodes are way more fun than season 1.,1475280000,2,300,3.8548387096774195
