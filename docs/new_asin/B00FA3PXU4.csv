8613674,5,B00FA3PXU4,"My son totally loves Dansing Kids. He sings, dances, laughs and does ""role-play"" with it. His friends love it too! This product is real fun and stimulating. I recommend it also to non-native English speakers. It will help you to learn the most popular English songs in no time! And all this bonding with your little one and having fun with him.",1395532800,,344,4.564516129032258
