2065136,2,B00027JYEY,"The Revengers Tragedy is one of the worst modern adaptations I have ever seen in my entire life! I cannot believe that someone would sit down and distinctly consider to even re-write such a script. I honestly believe that Thomas Middleton's literary work has been trashed through this overdone, lack of follow through and just down right horrific costuming and acting. I highly recommend that no one rents this dvd. What a disgrace to such a fine and intense play.",1140566400,,464,4.8125
2065137,4,B00027JYEY,"Another great postmodern version of a Renaissance play by director Alex Cox. THE REVENGER'S TRAGEDY is comparable to Julie Taymor's TITUS (Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus) or Derek Jarman's EDWARD II (the Marlowe play). The dialogue is based on the original language of Thomas Middleton's play, but the setting and action are futuristic. The movie is actually pretty faithful to an extremely bizarre play, which includes incest, necrophilia, murder, poison, and you name it. Apparently the 21st century has nothing on the late Renaissance when it comes to decadence. Christopher Eccleston gives a great performance as Vindici, the revenger character. There are a couple of scenes of lovemaking which don't technically include ""nudity."" There is also some violence, but what makes the play so shocking is the decadence of the characters and setting. Very darkly humorous and satirical.",1137542400,23,883,5.5
2065138,5,B00027JYEY,"I saw this film and had to get my own copy.  It's a strange, fabulous, weird, and amazing picture.  The film is a fusion of a really old script, modern texture, and futuristic noir grit.  It's very difficult to place, nearly impossible to handle, and quite demanding.  I feel like it only comes together after several viewings, though the first time through is shocking and enjoyable.  The more I watch it the more I like it.

The dialogue is fiercely original--written in an archaic and fantastic style, delivered in a colorful way, filmed to perfection.  It's amazing.  The accents and words are so interesting and (to me) strange that it frequently helps to have the sub-titles on through the first couple viewings.  Imagery is outstanding, camera work is great, and casting is dead on.

The soundtrack is awesome, too, and complements the film's entire sociopolitical backdrop so well the audio and visual become inseparably wed.  Tremendously successful, eminently enjoyable, and highly recommended.",1137024000,15,1004,5.135802469135802
2065139,5,B00027JYEY,"This movie is a thinker - you can watch it multiple times and keep getting more from it.

2065140,5,B00027JYEY,"While most films adaptations never seem to do justice to Jacobean drama (or any literature for that matter), ""The Revenger's Tragedy"" revitalizes an already great play by Middleton.  Though the screenplay differs from the original substantially, the director captures the essence of the play in a way that makes good use of the media of film.  And though, I usually do not like films that change so much of the original, here it works--and it works really fascinatingly.

The score is great.  The visual choices are great.  And the acting ensemble is particularly great--Christopher Eccleston as Vindice really blew me away.

The film lends itself to great discussion, and usage of the ol' gray matter.

I actually can't think of anything bad to say (I'm buying the DVD, so maybe after a few more viewings I'll find something).",1112918400,7,827,4.949275362318841
2065141,5,B00027JYEY,"Once again Alex Cox has brought us a magical piece of cinama.  I cannot come up with adequate words to express how wonderful this film is.  With Hollywood spending millions every day on fluff, Alex Cox has to scrounge for every penny to make masterpieces.  Do your soul a favor and buy this movie and watch it over and over again.  The fact that films like this never come to theaters is criminal and obsene.  The world is a better place because of Alex Cox and the brilliant artists and crews who bring us films like this one.  To Alex and all who help him with his work, please don't ever stop making movies for us.  We are waiting and relishing every effort that makes it to the screen and will do all that we can to support your work.",1093305600,11,738,4.228571428571429
2065142,5,B00027JYEY,"Alex Cox's ninth full-length feature is arguably his finest work since Highway Patrolman and the great Walker. This could largely be credited in the respect of the material being more personal to the director. His passion for the Jacobean play and for Spaghetti Westerns both shine brightly in this picture. And as can be guaranteed on each of this greatly-underappreciated artist's films, his style and wicked satirical humor are in full force here - in the Revengers Tragedy. This simple, and yet nasty tale of revenge written by a contemporary of William Shakespeare's with themes of love, sex, family, political decadence, and incest, and splendid dialogue from the original play by author Thomas Middleton and screen adapter Frank Cottrell Boyce features extraordinary performances, especially by Eddie Izzard, Christopher Eccleston, Andrew Schofield (Johnny Rotten in Cox's Sid and Nancy), and the immortal Derek Jacobi. Cox, himself, plays a small role as the Duke's driver, sporting a great haircut.

 Ambitioso (Justin Salinger): ""There's no advantage in the killing of a younger brother!""

 Alex's eccentric approach to storytelling is usually bound to throw off newcomers to his work, or casual movie-watchers whom are accustomed to a more typical and financially refined (by Hollywood standards) picture. Also, and largely, Alex's sarcasm tends to get misunderstood despite its value in intelligence and sometimes beauty, which is strong in this picture, partially because of the material, as it was in Walker - a film which went so unappreciated and so disliked that Cox was shunned by the Hollywood studios thereafter. Ironically, that film remains his towering masterpiece. So for those interested in the Revengers Tragedy I would recommend to watch the picture at least twice before you make up your mind on its merits. Actually, having seen it four times thus far, and having heard the commentary and watched the fantastic extra features supplied by Fantoma I have grown fonder of the film. And I had thoroughly enjoyed it upon my initial viewing of it, late last year. The score by Chumbawamba is terrific.

2065143,1,B00027JYEY,"I'm not a newbie to Shakespeare or any similar writers. I'm not put off by the idioms or way of speaking in this movie.  It was just utterly awful in every other way. Imagine Blade Runner meets Romeo and Juliet - that's what this movie made me think of.  For the most part, save the lead role played by Eccleston and the actress who portrayed Castiza, the acting was atrocious. The direction was all over the place. I generally like bizarre movies, but this was too much - I don't like bizarre for the sake of bizarre.  I found the meaning of the play was completely lost in this movie.",1297468800,2,586,4.3090909090909095
2065144,5,B00027JYEY,"Once, over dinner, I heard the late Fielding Dawson chortle:

""Body heat is a Fielding Dawson film! It's just so full of everything that is me!""  I thought at the time it was the wine and the star-struck company working on this middle-aged writer's brain, but now I too have found a film to cackle over: Alex Cox's The Revenger's Tragedy.  Indeed, I've been cackling over the original play (by Thomas Middleton, or some say Cyril Tourneur) for quite a few years.  Here's an example of the powerful writing found in the play in just the opening scene.  Vendice (the Revenger) is talking to his lady friend's skull about his intentions toward her murderer the Duke:

Duke; royal lecher; go, grey-hair'd adultery;
And thou his son, as impious steep'd as he;
And thou his bastard, true-begot in evil;
And thou his duchess, that will do with devil.
Four excellent characters--O, that marrowless age
Would stuff the hollow bones with damn'd desires,
And 'stead of heat, kindle infernal fires
Within the spendthrift veins of a dry duke,
A parch'd and juiceless luxur.  O God!--one
That has scarce blood enough to live upon,
And he to riot like a son and heir?
O the thought of that
Turns my abused heart-strings into fret.
Thou sallow picture of my poison'd love,
My study's ornament, thou shell of death,
Once the bright face of my betrothed lady,
When life and beauty naturally fill'd out
These ragged imperfections,
When two heaven-pointed diamonds were set
In those unsightly rings--then 'twas a face
So far beyond the artificial shine
Of any woman's bought complexion,
That the uprightest man (if such there be
That sin but seven times a day) broke custom,
And made up eight with looking after her.
***

One can't beat the Elizabethans for their language (as Hart Crane knew) and the play is full of brain-popping tropes that draw one further and further into the wind-up mechanism of the plot.

In the same manner Alex Cox gives us a grim eye-popper of a movie, as mannered visually as the language in Middleton's play is mannered to the ear.  Set in Liverpool in 2011, the Revenger's Tragedy takes place in a decadent city in a punked-out country presided over by the present Queen and her degenerate minions.  When the Duke dies he's surrounded by teddy bears and love and miss you notes like Princess Di was, and immediately after his death Vendice and his brother and sister watch the duchess fornicate with her son on a sci-fi holographic screen floating in the middle of the polluted air. The look these three have on their faces is one of the high points of the film.

The other is the opening sequence, which encapsulates the out-of-control feeling of the whole production.

A critic on the BBC complained of the ""roughness"" of the play--but I believe that the studied roughness and the inspired ineptness of some of the performers is part and parcel of punk aesthetics--just as much as the out of tune howls of the Sex Pistols and the jerky narratives of Kathy Acker's best novels.  If there is a weakness in the film, I'd say it's in the fact that the language as well as the plot of the original play are not fore-grounded enough.  When seeing the film, I'd suggest that you read the play first, then Cox's brilliance shines like a strobe light.

The sound track by Chumbawamba is a stunner too.

Christopher Eccleston does the job as the Revenger Vedici; Eddie Izzard is the Duke's effete heir.

I know I'm behind the times here--the film's been around since 2003, I see, but what the heck, better late than never.  My advice: see this DVD with the one you love.",1210723200,4,3573,4.678913738019169
2065145,5,B00027JYEY,"Fair warning, this is listed as a ""Black Comedy."" It's set in a post apocalyptic future, in Liverpool. The cast list alone makes this worthwhile: Christopher Eccleston, Derek Jacobi, & Eddie Izzard, to name but 3 amazing actors in this.  The story is an updated retelling of Thomas Middleton's play of the same name, with the 17th century Jacobian language intact.  If you enjoyed anything these aforementioned actors have been in, and/or A Clockwork Orange, then you will enjoy this. It's set in Liverpool in a time similar to Clockwork Orange.  Vindici (Eccleston) returns after a decade of absence to get revenge on the corrupt Duke (Jacobi) for poisoning his bride on their wedding day.  The Duke has prospered and his sons are just as evil as their father, including the Duke's heir and eldest (Izzard).  The story unfolds in an interesting manner from there.  The language is poetic and rather easy to follow.  The acting is superb.",1185840000,6,938,4.89873417721519
2065146,5,B00027JYEY,"This film is quite beautiful.  The action and story line are presented in such a way as to respect the audience to figure things out.  The music (by Chumbawamba, an AMAZING band) fits everything perfectly.  Overall, this film sews the elements together wonderfully...highly recommended.",1184544000,3,286,5.454545454545454
2065147,5,B00027JYEY,"Artistically, this is a very interesting presentation of the story.  By setting it in modern pronunciation (AKA Liverpool accents), the director forces us to understand how closely it resembles our own world; he even mentions in the extras how fitting it was that during the filming the US and Britain entered an actual war of revenge - unfortunately this world is politically strife with revenge and it makes the film that much more topical when he hands it to us in a setting full of factory-lined alleyways, chain link fences, corrugated metal and modern contraptions to allegorically dig in the point.

  The actors were absolutely perfect for their roles, every one of them (though i must confess to have a particular weakness for Derek Jacobi and Eddie Izzard - they're just both so interesting in their own right) and unlike Leonardo DiCaprio's Romeo, they actually seem to know what they are saying.  The manner of speaking incorporates both old style prose and modern day curses and slang, which only seems to further anchor it to the set and make the collaboration of 17th century play and modern day trappings seem all the more natural - kind of a cute way of talking too.  The language is very powerful, definitely gets it's point across.

  There is makeup on men (as one should expect when reading Eddie Izzard on the playbill), but rather than being a contagion that spread to the other actors I do see this makeup as an artistic advantage.  Besides tying the movie to it's stage roots (where all men wear makeup), the makeup visually divulges the excess that these rich men were treating themselves to, and also outlines their vanity very well indeed.

  I also found fascinating the movies' proposition that different leadership would simply find different reasons to be corrupt.  I am very glad that they left in the scene with the confrontation of the mother.  She had toyed with the idea of selling her daughter's favors for the goodwill of the duke.  Not only did the confrontation scene provide continuity by tying up this loose end, but it also lets the audience know how fine a line we all walk - how easy it is for vengeance to go too far and for one to become no better than their enemy.

  This is the best adaptation of an out-of-date play to the screen that I have seen yet.  While I do enjoy old plays, it is very hard to relate to them.  The licenses that Alex Cox has taken are illuminating and keep you on your toes.",1172534400,7,2449,4.635730858468677
2065148,4,B00027JYEY,"Much ado on this DVD is made of whether a reconciliation scene should have been cut from the film.  Though after the fact the director states he was probably mistaken when insisting to retain the scene, I heartily disagree.

An early scene shows the main character disguised beyond recognition to his sister and mother.  (Neither time I've viewed the film has it been clear to me that the wedding slaughter and his disappearance from society were a decade earlier, likely accounting for his family's not knowing him now.)  Incognito, he is pleased to find that his sister is virtuous but shocked to discover that his mother is willing to pimp her daughter's virtue for the sake of payment.  This led me to anticipate a climactic scene at the end where the ""revenger"" would punish his mother for her immorality.  The reconciliation that displaces this scene absolutely needs, therefore, to be included in the story.

Regardless of what one voice in the documentary insists, theme is NOT automatically superceded in deference to bloody action, just to keep the 15-yr-olds in the audience attentive.  Indeed, one infers that busy MTV editing of a confusing arena competition at the opening of the plot should have been ditched, but was used in deference to mandates of the ""weird movie"" sponsors of the production.

The second unexpected story element involved a plot to finally kill the Duke.  Given the cynical bloodiness of this trenchant satire, when the protagonist's sister agrees to disguise herself as the Duke's lust partner and dons a wig, I feared she'd end up slaughtered by mistake a la TITUS ANDRONICUS and the like.  How nice to see she survives unscathed.  At least survives THAT adventure!

The DVD correctly identifies this fascinating play as a precursor to Joe Orton.  It only whets one's curiosity for more about Thomas Middleton, and to wish some of his other plays were also captured on film.",1172102400,2,1912,4.934375
2065149,2,B00027JYEY,"All I needed to watch this movie was to know that Alex Cox had directed it, but as soon as the credits rolled, and there was Doctor Who (Eccleston) and Eddie Izzard and Derek Jacobi, and a soundtrack by Chumbawumba, I was settling in and expecting quite a thrill.

But outside of the wonderful nastiness of the original play, there is a serious dirth of solid direction in this movie.  I chalk it up to the Luhrmann effect--spend so much time finding flashy ways to update the way a Renaissance-era play can be staged, but pay almost NO attention to the actual acting or use of the language itself.  The Luhrmann _Romeo & Juliet_ was almost unwatchable for its clumsy Shakespeare--if so much time is spent updating the setting, why not also spend some time to update the delivery of the lines?  Not that I would necessarily recommend throwing out the old script and rewriting all of the dialogue in modern lingo.  This approach often falls flat as well, but in keeping the original text, it would seem helpful to teach the actors how to say the lines with genuine expression and emotion rather than stumble over the lines in a faux-classical approach.

A linguist recently did a study of English accents and determined that a Renaissance London accent probably more resembled an Appalaichan accent, so these poor renditions of classic English drama need to STOP these fake deliveries and try to deliver lines with some genuine emotion rather than present the fallacy of a classical performance.

The story here is a juicy one, full of incest and rape and bawdy jokes and necrophilia.  Poison and love and revenge, and Cox picks up well on the sense of revenge spiral and how violence begets violence into endless spirals, but his overly-hyped setting with loud combinations of colors and neon and technology up the wazoo grows quickly tiresome when the lines sound about as fluid as kindergarten recital.

And poor Derek Jacob...in purple fingernail polish and dark lipstick flounders without solid direction on the language--if a great actor like this had trouble pulling off an even adequate performance, what chance has the rest of the cast have?  I am a huge fan of Eddie Izzard, and I long for him to be in a stupendous movie, but here he is as clumsy as most everyone else in the film.

Read the play, and try to imagine a solid, straightforward performance without all the unnecessary lights and mirrors.  This is a brutal work, worthy of a brutal performance.",1170028800,5,2467,4.765258215962441
2065150,3,B00027JYEY,"A man's newlywed bride is murdered by an evil duke after she resists his lecherous advances.  A decade later the man returns, bent upon vengeance.

One of the nice things about amateur reviewing is not needing to review anything.  No assignments, no deadlines.  We choose books, music and movies by whim or by purpose.  I stumbled upon REVENGERS TRAGEDY while doing a search of movies using the keywords ""Australia"" and ""post-apocalyptic.""  REVENGERS TRAGEDY topped the recommendation lists of a lot of Australian post-apocalyptic movies. That was the bait.  The hook was set when I read this was a futuristic adaptation of a 17th century Jacobean revenge play - the image of Blade Runner merging with Macbeth came to mind - starring Derek Jacobi and directed by the guy who directed the great cult classic `Repo Man.'

 `The Revengers Tragedy' is a stage-play attributed to Thomas Middleton, circa 1606. I have to admit I'd never heard of Middleton, and even after twenty minutes of power surfing I still can't tell you the difference between an Elizabethan like Shakespeare and a Jacobean like Middleton.  They were contemporaries, more or less, and threw a shovelful of `thees' and `thous' into their scripts.  They both ended dialogue scenes with rhymed couplets. According to the specials on the dvd and some internet sources Middleton was a big one, second only to Shakespeare in some estimations, and an author of Sacred Text.  Not `sacred' in the religious sense.  `Sacred' in the sense that pages upon pages of dialogue and soliloquies had to be transported in their entirety to the screenplay to maintain integrity.  And therein lies the rub.  Not only is the text dense - too dense for the screen - but the action takes place in Liverpool.  In sooth the accents were impossible for my midwestern United States ears to handle.  The last line I heard before turning the English subtitles on at about the twenty-minute mark was ""Nace wan, gai.""  Rewound and subtitled the line translated to a harmless ""Nice one, girl.""

 Look - on the stage you describe, on the screen you display.  The intimacy between stage actors and their audience is achieved by artful talk.  Screen intimacy is achieved by the artful arrangement of moving images. Ninety-nine point nine percent of all stage plays stink when filmed.  It's not a fault of the play, or because movie audiences are dumber than live theater audiences.  It's simply a different medium.  Movies deliver the goods visually, stage-plays verbally.  Director Alex Cox jazzed it up some with post-punk costumes and make-up, as well as some snappy camera angles, but this one still creaked like a four hundred year old play.

 If I had ten stars to spend on it I'd give REVENGERS TRAGEDY five.  It's not a reflection on Cox or Middleton, either.  Heck, Cox fell in love with the play when he first read it as a teenager, and stories a good director is passionate about always deserve respect.  Christopher Eccleston, who plays Vindici, is very good as the lean and hungry widower with a score to settle.  For those with more patience for movies transposed from the stage this one may work a lot better.  My score is a weak three stars.  The story may have been appropriate for a seventeenth century English audience, but I found it tediously talky.",1148169600,4,3301,4.867145421903052
2065151,3,B00027JYEY,"The Jacobean play Revenger's Tragedy by Thomas Middleton here finds an update, much in the same vein as did Titus, Julie Taymor's recent reworking of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. In fact, the same juxtaposition of over-stylized contemporary motifs and the original language of the source material is present. In both works, lust and murder figure prominently, as do the expected intricate machinations required to implement the actions expressing these venal sins.

Christopher Eccleston plays our ""hero"", Vindici, and while he is a bit over the top, his words do pierce and play the game of revenge, just as he does himself. The gifts of language do not forsake the author of the play, nor the screenwriter, Joe Boyce, who keeps most of the dialogue intact, and occasionally interjects a modern phrase--""piss off"", for example. Yet in one of the more interesting extras included on the DVD, an Oxford don holds forth on the marked differences between Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, especially their use of the language--the latter being more earthy, as it were.

The director, Alex Cox, agrees; he's interviewed and tells of his fascination with the play as long ago as his teenage years. Age and youth figure prominently as well in this work; Derek Jacobi appears as the evil Duke (something) and carries it off quite well. He's another actor's actor who couldn't sing a false note if he tried. His four loathsome sons--the ""best"" of them played by noted British comic Eddie Izzard--constnatly plot against themselves and based on this ill feeling, reduce their chances of ascending to the Dukedom.

It seems our Vindici had his bride poisoned by this evil Duke, ten years prior, and now seeks revenge against him. Also here is the Duke's second wife (or perhaps third) whose attractions are not confined to her husband; another oldster, an ostensibly nobler member of the peerage, played by Anthony Booth (Antonio), and his much younger and totally hottie wife; and various and sundry other inhabitants in and around the Dukedom.

Although much energy has gone into this production with quite a bit of flash, for some reason it does not quite have the juice and spark found in Titus. To be blunt, it's found wanting, to some degree, and one is not quite sure why that is.  It's well staged, but the acting is not consistently good. While Eccleston, Jacobi, and Izzard do well, the other Duke's sons don't have their acting chops down as proficiently. The pacing is not as strong as it should be, and there are inconsistencies not in the juxtaposition of modern and 16th century, but instead in how much importance this juxtaposition has. It's as if it's more or less thrown in to try to make it seem fresh, while in Titus, one thinks the same at first, but gradually one sees that the juxtaposition really works and becomes an integral part of the production.

Here that's not true. In that sense, it's somewhat reminiscent of Cox's Walker, taking place in the 19th century in Nicaragua, but complete with cigarette vending machines, etc. It's done to be kind of cool, but doesn't have that effect at all. In addition, although this in and of itself is not a severe criticism, you may have to turn on the English subtitles inasmuch as the Liverpudlian accents are thick.

It would have been nicer if Cox had a stronger sense of integrating two different eras for a reason, rather than slamming them together as he does here. Parts of the production tend to lag a bit while others carry enough punch to move the scenes through the film without much effort at all.

Close, but no Havana cigar.",1142899200,6,3603,4.856677524429967
2065152,1,B00027JYEY,"Any sense of story is completely lost in this blood and gore fest.  I understand that the director is attemping to comment on the random violence of our world.  Is that something new?  ""Bonnie and Clyde"" did that over 30 years ago.

8023182,5,B00027JYEY,"I agree with all the positive reviews for this film.
Some of the other reviewers are far more eloquent and knowledgeable than I, the following is just a personal statement.

This film is based upon a very black, perverse and sordid comedy written in the time of William Shakespeare by Thomas Middleton. I'm not familiar with the original story but it was obviously intended to be shocking and entertaining. I guess if you were preoccupied with the Black Plague or something this would have been funny back in the day.
There is some great contemporary humor here despite the horrible things that take place.
Some of the creepiest most immoral characters I have ever seen are in this film and are eerily realistic now.
Derek Jacobi's The Duke is classic horror. Part Dick Cheney, part Vincent Price. Very well played and distressingly modern.
Casting and acting are excellent, the best I've seen in any film but Alex Cox's cameo is a bit distracting.
The dialogue is a mix of old English Jacobean and modern English. Thick UK accents make it a little difficult to follow but it is worthwhile. Writing is excellent, I think the funniest lines are in current English to great affect.
Much more Play than Film this is a thoughtful effort by Alex Cox.
His Punk sensibility and style are very fitting for this ancient story and he tells it in good taste, but this is not for children. Despite all the debauchery this work is not nearly as explicit as A Clockwork Orange.
Impressive restraint.

No redemption.
