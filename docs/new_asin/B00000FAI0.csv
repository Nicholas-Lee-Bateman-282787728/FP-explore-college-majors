8422893,4,B00000FAI0,"This is a moving portrait of Karmapa's return to Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet. Be sure to get the 1st edition by Tsurphu Foundation used on the internet and not the Mystic Fire bad copy. If you like this video try to get a copy of Living Buddha by Clemens Kuby which documents the entire process including HH Karmapa's discovery in Eastern Tibet, which for me gets 5 stars but may be very hard to find. I got a new DVD from Amazon in Germany as it is apparently unavailable in the US.",1323561600,,482,4.25
8422894,4,B00000FAI0,"If you're intrigued about Tibetan Buddhism, particularly the Kagyu sect's leader H.H. Karmapa, you will enjoy viewing ""The 17th Karmapa's Return to Tsurphu.""  Narrated by Ward Holmes (who gives explanations of the  Karmapa's relationship to various Rinpoches), the film offers considerable  footage of the young Karmapa's return (via auto/horse) to Tsurphu Monastery  in Communist Tibet, along with all the pageantry accorded to such a  prominent figure.  The film also includes footage of the various head  lamas, ceremonies and the formalities surrounding the hair-cutting ceremony  and enthronement, along with scenes of Tibetan pilgrims and formal  recognition by Communist Chinese officials.  There are scenic views of  Tsurphu Monestary and surrounding areas, along with comments from family  members and the head of Rumtek Monastery.  The young Karmapa also is seen  in more relaxed moments, reading, planning, dancing and talking with his  tutors, etc.  Although the video is not of the highest technical quality,  it captures and preserves a significant event and key Buddhist personages  for posterity.",961718400,3,1112,5.717791411042945
