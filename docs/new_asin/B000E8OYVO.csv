8107389,5,B000E8OYVO,"this is a well researched but self serving documentary
it relies heavily on Christian scriptures not contained in The New Testament
so it requires a sympathetic Christian viewer to accept spiritual authority
of writings outside accepted Christian doctrine
the heavy concentration on the issue of the ingredients of The Holy Annointing Oil
of The Fire Baptism
should not really serve as a religious justification for the legalization of the smoking Marijuana
so the theory & message of this documentary
intended to associate sacred divine Christian ceremony
with frivolous act of enjoying illegal drugs
is not valid.",1345507200,,615,5.416666666666667
8107390,3,B000E8OYVO,"Well, this is something for all you old dope smoking christians to check out. Unfortunately it misses out complelty on what the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, or fire is, but, there is some credibility to the interpratation of using the word we all know as ""canabis"", instead of the translation of the word that has been substituted instead. That's about all I got out of this video. I would say what they got was good, but what they missed would make it impossible to justify that this was what the Baptism of Fire or of the Holy Spirit was really all about. You won't miss out on going to heaven if you miss out on this particular translation of the meaning of the baptism of fire, but you will miss out on going to heaven if you do miss out on receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit which occurs after you've been born again, or regenrated, which doesn't happen until after you go through conversion first. In other words it's conversion first, which is to ""enter the straight gate and walk the narrow way,"" then being born again or regenarated, so that you may ""find life at the end,"" and then comes the coming of the Comforter or Holy Spirit to you, which is the Baptism of Fire. You can convert yourself, but only Jesus can bestow the New Life or regenaration upon you, and only the Holy Spirit can give you His Baptism of Fire, or sealing of you ,just like cauterizing a wound. I hope that's simple enough for those of you who want to have eternal life or go to heaven to give you a good start. Conversion is the only one you can take on Faith, which means to believe something so much that you act on it, the other two cannot be taken on faith though, they have to be experiential, you just can't believe them in other words, they actually have to happen to you. This is not my interpratation, but what the Bible says. Some of you have had these experiences and know what I'm talking about. But, if you disagree, then get in there, study it for youself, and prove me wrong. Good Luck, for God doesn't want any of us to be lost, and God Bless you for taking the time to read this very short and abreviated version of Salvation Doctrine.(...and please forgive me for the spelling mistakes I'm sure I've made. Becoming saved won't make you perfect in that way....but it will in another ;) )",1255564800,,2294,4.34965034965035

The Holy Anointing Oil that is used today is a farce; some recipes used are actually dangerous others are just blessed cooking oil.  The word Chrism means anointing, Christ means the Anointed One, since the false oil was used on all Christians, none have been Anointed, the Church is misleading it's followers and actually creating Anti Christ's' (against anointing).  Christian, comes from Chrism (anointing), no Christian has been anointed with the true recipe of Gods Holy Anointing Oil from Exodus 30:23, they have been deceived. This according to Christian beliefs is detrimental.",1145577600,3,795,5.147286821705427
