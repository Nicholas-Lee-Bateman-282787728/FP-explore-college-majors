8612289,1,B00F4IMBSC,"This is a film about Carl (John Halas) and Jade ( Alana Jackler), two strangers tied to a tree. They are going to be killed by a group of what are apparently demon worshippers judging by the overuse of voice enhancers and backwards masking. That is pretty much it. Oh, there are some flashbacks. Film uses quick cut away scenes and stills.

Note: If you are sitting on the ground tied around the arms with your back to a tree and your hands are free. Just inhale to loosen the ropes and pull them up over your head.

There are worse movies out there. None came to mind while I was watching this one.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. Appears to have some quick shots of a sex scene from a male's nude behind.",1431648000,,700,4.287878787878788
