7985289,5,B00008LDP2,"My first grandson watched Little Bear episodes on television daily and loved the show.  It was a good show for teaching children morals and right from wrong, but it is no longer showing on television.  So, I have decided to buy the DVDs so my two latest grandsons will be able to visit Little Bear's world, too.",1444176000,,311,4.43859649122807

7985291,5,B00008LDP2,"I wish there were more episodes in the series!  The story lines keep the imagination and innocence of children.... not to mention, teaching the respect of parents/authority, having the diversity of friends and tenderness to take care of animals. Great animation and bright colors to keep toddlers (or older children) interested.",1389052800,5,328,5.431372549019608

Running time is listed as approximately 110 minutes, and all episodes are available in French audio as well! The frame is full screen, so that may be a flaw for some.",1362700800,11,399,5.138461538461539
