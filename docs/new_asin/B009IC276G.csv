Japanese drama DVDs usually have bad subtitles but more towards the end of the season like the last two episodes..this one however had terrible subtitles from episode one. I was extremely disappointed.
just watch it online and don't waste your money on this",1365292800,,361,4.746031746031746
8541793,3,B009IC276G,"I knew when the English was bad on the box what I was in for with the movie. Terrible subtitles! I had to use context clues to know what was going on :( From what i could tell it was a great story, funny and light-hearted with dramatic moments that were heartfelt but not overdone, and charming characters you felt for",1362182400,,318,4.229508196721311
8541794,5,B009IC276G,"I found this drama to be completely enjoyable.

Oguri Shun's character, Hyuga Tohru is a brilliant computer programmer and entrepreneur who has prosopagnosia, which means that he can't remember faces or names without a tremendous amount of effort.  Watching Natsui Makoto, (played by Ishihara Satomi) a poor Tokyo University graduate, almost unintentionally work her way through his armour is a delight to watch.  Hyuga Tohru's character is saved from being the typical arrogant rich man found in many Japanese dramas by Oguri Shun's portrayal of a man who is actually quite sensitive, but because of his disability, doesn't understand how to get close to other people.

This drama has it all.  Friendship, romance, betrayal, rags to riches, and riches to rags.",1352160000,3,761,5.256198347107438
