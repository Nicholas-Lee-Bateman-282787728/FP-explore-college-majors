481821,4,630257207X,"Very interesting movie. Glad I watched it. Chose to watch it after visiting Warm Springs, GA, the Little White House. I'm sure it was very primitive compared to her lifestyle in NY which may be why she didn't come or endear herself to folks there. New perspective on her personality.",1471651200,,283,4.68

481901,5,630257207X,"I watched this TV movie when it was first on and fell in love with it.  I have always admired Eleanor Roosevelt and Jean Stapleton's portrayal of her was wonderful.  She seemed, to me to be one of the few first ladys who did something besides entertain, decorate and pick appropriate public and charitable things to support.  She had opinions of her own and stood by them.  I am sure there was quite a bit of dramatization in this movie but that doesn't change the fact it was good.",1404086400,,482,4.382022471910112

481906,5,630257207X,"Jean Stapleton brings down the house as Eleanor Roosevelt after the death of FDR. She shows off her brilliant acting and presents Eleanor as a formidable but lovable widow, mother, grandmother and diplomat, who paved the way for the UN and many great women as world leaders.  I bought this after Jean Stapleton's death and was pleased it did.  She's is a great actress.
