8534444,2,B0091UCB5W,"As a huge fan of this movie, I ordered this DVD assuming that it was a 2 disc deluxe edition, as the featured pictures would lead one to believe. However the copy that I received from MovieMars was a basic 1 disc copy in a regular case. Seeing as I already own that particular version, I basically wasted 20 bucks. I'm not sure if any of the other sellers have the 2 disc version, but I was very disappointed with what I received from MovieMars. As for the movie itself, its freaking fantastic in any packaging and I highly recommend it!",1312329600,,537,4.326732673267327
8534445,5,B0091UCB5W,"This movie is an absolute MUST for Callum Keith Rennie fans; he shines in his role as a reluctant returning member of the Canadian punk band Hard Core Logo for their reunion tour. This movie has been described as a dark, realist Spinal Tap, and was billed as a black comedy. While the movie has its funny, often hilarious moments, it actually concentrates on the real, human emotions driving each character. This is a character-driven movie, rather than a plot- or action-driven movie, and shows a great deal of insight about the internal politics of friendship. Though the performance scenes are also very cool.",1029974400,8,612,4.894230769230769
8534446,4,B0091UCB5W,"Hard Core Logo is one for the best movies, If you want to see a movie about a traveling punk/rock band. Hugh [Headstones] is not only a great musician but a great actor. This also shows the band [Hard Core Logo] playing songs on stage. [Note: Hard Core Logo is not a real band]",1003017600,2,277,4.148148148148148
