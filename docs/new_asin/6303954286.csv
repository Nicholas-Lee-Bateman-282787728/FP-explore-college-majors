If you like corny 80's movies then you'll like this... if you don't, you'll hate it. Just look at the 3 reviews before me. Two of them where rating the vhs release!",1355961600,,302,4.224137931034483
8082556,2,6303954286,"I had high hopes for this movie. I thought as science fiction I would like it, and as a dog movie my sister would like it.

The dog didn't even arrive until about two thirds of the way through the movie.

The acting was sub-standard, the plot so slow as to be glacial. Even wanting to believe it was good, and having seen the five stars, I was so disappointed as the movie dragged on and on. I kept telling my sister, it's going to pick up, and then I told her again. Then I noticed her eyes were closed.

Even the eventual action scenes were so dull as to be anti-climatic.

I want my hour and a half back.

And I lost some cred with my sister for making her sit through this. Oh I had some credits in that department because she made me watch the big lebowski, a movie neither of us could abide.

There are so many good movies, I recommend you pass on this one.",1355184000,,863,4.047058823529412
8082557,5,6303954286,"This...is...the.....GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!  This movie has everything. Acid washed shorty-shorts, a dog with a microchip in his head, a meathead, brick-like, mulleted, sassy, take-no-guff renegade cop, also with a microchip in his head, and a woman with a wool sweater that says ""Mean Streets"" on the back.  I'm contemplating suicide because there is no way life can better than this!  From here on out, it's only gonna be downhill.  I tried to think of something that could make this movie better, but you know what?  I couldn't think of anything.  If you also enjoy this movie, you may want to check out the Elmore Leonard novel, The Switch, on which this film is loosely based.",1109980800,7,687,4.930434782608696
