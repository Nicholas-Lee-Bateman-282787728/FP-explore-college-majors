8145351,3,B000IG449O,"In SHAOLIN WOODEN MEN Jackie Chan plays a traumatized youth who was rendered speechless by having witnessed the murder of his father. As the film opens, Jackie isn't quite cutting it even after two years of studying at the local Shaolin temple. He's slow when it comes to the training curriculum which, in his eyes, consists of nothing but chopping wood and carrying buckets of water. His perceived lack of effort causes him to be time and again berated by his instructors, and his fellow students frequently mock him. One night he chances upon a hidden cave in which an imperious prisoner is kept shackled by the Shaolin monks, and a friendship is struck, if by friendship it's understood that Jackie is always fetching things for the prisoner. Jackie is all kinds of naive.

One of the Shaolin temple's more challenging rites of passage is the gauntlet of the Wooden Men, basically, a series of passageways inhabited by wooden dummies which independently, randomly strike blows at the occasional brave but foolhardy pupil. The prisoner offers to instruct Jackie in a more brutal form of kung fu, so that Jackie can successfully navigate the Wooden Men obstacle course. Except that the kung fu that Jackie learns goes against the peaceful ways of Shaolin. I'm not surprised - and you shouldn't be, either - that the prisoner turns out to be the head of the nefarious Green Dragon gang, and that he soon escapes captivity. Back to his old villainous ways, only his mute pupil Jackie stands in his way. Ooooh, reckoning.

SHAOLIN WOODEN MEN is early Jackie Chan, back when dude was still exercising the more traditional brands of kung fu. The more freelanced martial arts style comes later in his career. Not so much with the slapstick stuff, either, although there are still some moments of levity. This is mostly a straightforward story, and you are some kind of country bumpkin if you didn't see certain plot points coming. But can Jackie's gliding snake technique - learned from an old woman martial artist - be enough to counter the bad guy's deadly secret punch? SHAOLIN WOODEN MEN is not one of Jackie's best films, but there is that curiosity factor of this being one of his earlier films, before he became the Jackie Chan we know and love. Back in 1976, he probably did get insured for his films. Another point of curiosity is that Jackie doesn't speak until almost at the end of the movie. The fight scenes are decent, with Jackie demonstrating some cool moves and acrobatics.

So let's talk about the DVD. On one hand, you get Jackie Chan and Gordon Liu on the same DVD, in pictures that both came out in 1976. On the other hand, it's a pretty shady DVD. SHAOLIN WOODEN MEN is dubbed in English, is (I think) shown in its original theatrical aspect, and comes with dodgy video quality, the picture looking washed out and the exterior scenes, when shot at night, pretty much indiscernable. If you can get a better copy elsewhere, go for it. Same goes for CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS. There are better copies of it out there. This version is dubbed in English and is in craptacular full screen and, I think, may have been recorded from a VHS copy. These two films together probably deserve a rating of 4 stars out of 5. But you gotta penalize for the shabby quality of the DVD.

CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS tracks the journey of Wong Fei-hung (Gordon Liu a.k.a. Chia Hui Liu), a persistent young man who desperately wants to learn kung fu, and it's a stinging bone of contention that his father, a martial arts master, simply will not teach him. Wong Fei-hung finally nabs a sifu, which happens to be the very same teacher who had instructed Wong Fei-hung's father. Wong Fei-hung's evolution from inept but enthusiastic student to accomplished fighter is wracked with false starts and stumbles. The crux of the plot revolves around the strenuous hung gar training he undergoes as he prepares to take on an assassin and, later, redeem the honor of his father's school. There is an uproarious Pao competition to win and a nasty rival school to contend with, because ""Pang and his school... are out to cause trouble.""

Director Liu Chia-Liang (a.k.a. Lau Kar-leung) always tells a good story, and he often gifts himself with a plum role. He plays the leading villain in this one, and his showdown with Gordon Liu is the film's highlight. Overall, CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS is a slower paced picture. Liu Chia-Liang always did try to inject bits of his martial arts philosophy into his film projects, and this usually resulted in a more fleshed out, more thoughtful, even a more spiritual narrative. And, sometimes, the action suffers in terms of its frequency. What's never lacking, though, is energy on the screen. Liu Chia-Liang knows how to compose a scene.

One of Liu Chia-Liang's martial arts philosophies is vocalized by Wong Fei-Hung's sifu: ""Kung fu cannot be learned in just a few years. After two years, people start to believe they're not bad. But then, after some twenty years, you realize you're not so good. But, still, if you're not feeling satisfied, well, that means you're on the right track, then."" Taking that into account, Wong Fei-hung comes out as some friggin' prodigy. If you like this film, there's a sequel of sorts, titled MARTIAL CLUB. It moves faster than CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS.",1285545600,2,5310,4.760043431053203
