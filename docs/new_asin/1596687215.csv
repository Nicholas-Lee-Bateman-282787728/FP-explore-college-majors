200761,1,1596687215,"I was very hopeful about this and thought that it would be a good beginner's guide to getting started-- explaining the process, the materials I needed, and how to go about doing it.  Alas, I was wrong.  She does explain the basics of the process but a materials guide-- NOPE.  She kind of bypasses that pretty crucial bit of information.  I am left not knowing exactly what solutions I am supposed to look for and, worse still, she does not explain that there are TWO types of solutions-- an acid and non acid (toxic and non-toxic-ish).  She ONLY talks about EFing copper and nothing about any other materials; those are different processes so that would also be good to know.  I was very very disappointed in this and thought it was a waste of time and money.  If I would have watched it right away, I would have sent it back.",1377216000,16,827,4.437086092715232
200762,2,1596687215,Isn't not that easy if you don't have a explicit and a good materials list. They could do a better job explaning the materials where to buy it.,1363996800,3,143,4.142857142857143
200763,5,1596687215,"Great book and easy dvd. The instructor is very clear on what to do with this process. The equipment isn't cheap- a bit pricey, but the end result will be worth it for a true artisan jewelry maker like myself.",1338595200,,209,4.25
200764,3,1596687215,"Basic ,simple, uses ONLY the etch 3 rectifier ,if you are looking for instruction on using the Caswell rectifier that you see on the introductory video, they are NOT in the DVD.",1333497600,7,177,4.5625
200765,4,1596687215,Good basic introduction that will help you to get you started with this technique.  Like that she kept it simple,1333324800,,112,4.6
200766,5,1596687215,I have come to rely on Amazon to find what I am looking for no matter how obscure. This video is very well done. It is clear & covers the subject completely. It gives sources for equipment needed.,1330214400,6,196,4.184210526315789
7799836,1,1596687215,"I was very disappointed in this video one of the worst instructional videos I have ever purchased.
 This video  contains very little information on electroforming, it dose not even talk about the voltage in the amps which are very critical to the  process.  There is also a lot of bad information in the video.  Don't waste your money.  I will ask Amazon for a refund.  There are much better resources for free on the Internet that actually have good information!",1506729600,,463,4.7125
7799837,5,1596687215,Is a well done DVD just found it FREE on YouTube after I bought it!,1492473600,,67,3.533333333333333

7799839,1,1596687215,"If you have a basic understanding of the steps required to electroform don't bother!

Beyond the most general information this dvd is useless. No information is given on how to use the rectifiers, voltage/amperage needed and only the most minimal troubleshooting.

Advice is given like ""you can easily add jump rings to your piece"" but no information is given on the type of product you should use or steps required.

I'll sum up the actual info provided: make sure your piece is dry, varnish it 2-3 times, paint it with conductive paint, connect it to the leads on the rectifier, let it sit for 1-12 hours.

That's it! All the stuff I already knew and hoped would be expanded upon. Again this dvd is a complete waste of money",1468454400,6,726,4.604651162790698

7799841,2,1596687215,I found out more about electroforming from searching the web than this video. Certainly not worth $20 for a 40 minute minimal explanation of this craft,1452729600,7,151,4.846153846153846

7799845,2,1596687215,"The author does a very poor job of explaining the electroforming process. In the section on things you will need she does not use the full name when you are told where to get the different items needed. I would not recommend this product. you can learn more on line for free, save your money and search the web.",1405987200,8,311,4.288135593220339
