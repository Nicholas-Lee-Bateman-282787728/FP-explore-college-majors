8193727,5,B000PY316Q,Black Lagoon is a classic and I only need two more DVDs to complete the series. Wait'll ya see the vampire twins!,1403222400,,113,4.181818181818182
8193728,4,B000PY316Q,"Rock and Revy are inside the sunken U-Boat recovering the painting. They are joined by a group of unfriendly neo-Nazis. During the ordeal, they have a conversation that shakes their relationship up a bit. Revy tells Dutch that she can't stand working with Rock, and that she wants rid of him as soon as possible. Dutch decides to send the 2 of them on errands together. During their day out, they reach an uncomfortable understanding. Although they are totally different, their differences make them a great team. It looks like Revy won't have to shoot Rock in the face after all. That's a good thing. It would be a short series if she did.

I enjoyed volume 2. I wasn't sure if I was gonna like this anime, so I am renting it on Netflix to find out. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a harsh series with lots of violence language and a little nudity. Definitely don't show it to kids or your Grandma. If that stuff doesn't bother you, I think you might enjoy it quite a bit. I'm rerally liking it so far, and I think I'm gonna get the seasons 1 & 2 box set after I'm done renting them on Netflix.",1360368000,,1096,4.3463414634146345
8193729,3,B000PY316Q,"So now the fighting really begins, as the Black Lagoon crew get into it with Neo-Nazis.  Well, kind of, these guys are really no match for our Heroes.  Er...I mean they are no match for the pirates...or, to be honest, no match for Revy.  The exchange, on the phone, between the real Nazi and Dutch is interesting and suggests another future exchange.
There is some tension between Revy and Rock but not really sure where that is going because I can never see them hooking up.  Revy is WAY too unbalanced to be trusted with anything but a gun or a slice of pizza.  She is, after all, nothing but a weapon.  A mad, insane, unbalanced weapon.
Than there is the Maid.  Who shows up just in time to force us to buy the next DVD.
No extras, no really plot twists.  Not sure this story has a point to it but I will continue to follow it. Bought the third DVD because, frankly, I got it cheap.  Really cheap.  And want to see what Roberta does.",1322784000,,936,4.237288135593221
8193730,4,B000PY316Q,"Volume Two Of Black Lagoon if you've been following along slowly amps up the action as we get to see new sides to the characters. Dutch shows you he can do more than look cool is sunglasses. Benny shows a side of himself that can be expected. Revy Is Still Revy but even more so. And Rock in one episode shows why they keep him around as we are introduced to an another player in the land of Ronapur. the Church of Violence, headed by Sister Yolanda and we meet Sister Eda, boths Nuns make Rosette Christopher(Chrno Crusade) Look Like Sally Field.  The HighLight of the Disc is Episode 8, where we meet Roberta, a Maid who is......well let's just say there is a new queen of the Combat Maids (Sorry, Mahoro). Disc two Pumps up the action as we follow The lagoon Company into a situation after another. again the plot is fast moving and easy to follow.  Don't forget to get volume three too, where the action hits it's climax.",1206835200,,925,4.372093023255814

You like a silky slender well drawn woman drawing two Thai made hand canons having organisms as she swiss cheeses aforementioned goons?! WHAT ARE You WAITing for!!!?

8193732,5,B000PY316Q,"This anime had Extreme violence and strong language. It not rated PG, it rated 16+ age. This anime use the ""F"" word a lot, mostly on every episode.
For a price of $22.99 for 4 episode is a great price $5.75 for each episode. Run time's 100 min. is about 1 hour and 40 min. This DVD had 5.1 DTS audio(english) and 16:9 anamorphic wide screen. So it look and sound great in your HDTV and surround Sound system. The anime had good plot about a group of outlaw at Southwest Asia. There a lot of shooting than the first volume. In this volume contain semi-nudity, there a little love story between Revy and Rock. There're two good part in this volume is the maid's a very sexy maid name Roberta(is a woman), who's armed, carry a shotgun(cleverly disguised as an umbrella), second part is the next Volume of Black Lagoon, which Revy and Roberta will fight each other. This's going to be HOT! I don't want to spoil anyone until you see it.
But overall is a great DVD that worth your money, This anime is very similar to Cowboy Bebop style. Great drama, action, and comedy.
Very high recommandation/ Buy it.

Humor: adult swim unsure about air this on tv, they may air it or you can make them by fan-mail about this anime.",1186358400,4,1214,4.371681415929204
8193733,4,B000PY316Q,"The Saga of the Black Lagoon and it's unsavory crew continues as protagonists Rock and Revy, visit the gloomy remains of a German U-Boat to retrieve a Nazi-era painting. While inside the wreckage, Rock confronts Revy over the morality of their looting this wreckage and gains further insight into her brutal, nihilistic attitude...it all culminates to a fast-paced, exciting gun fight against neo-nazi storm troopers on board their ship. Unfortunately, for viewers of the Japanese version, hearing sea-faring, neo-nazi Sturmabteilung spout their overconfident bravado in Japanese robs these episodes of some of their realism. Next, Rock spends a day working odd jobs for Dutch with a reluctant Revy...still sore from their exchange in the submarine, Revy doesn't take too kindly to Rock's challenge that she look inside herself and confront her inner demons...Black Lagoon continues to be an exciting and at times, profound, anime. (The PG rating seems a little bit low given the high levels of graphic violence and profanity, so be warned)",1184544000,2,1040,5.347560975609756
