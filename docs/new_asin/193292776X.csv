7801627,1,193292776X,"It seems as if Mark Hart tries too hard to be 'cool' with teens and it is cringe-making.

But not only that, he seems so obsessed with acting the fool to keep the teens giggling, his explanation of the order of the six days of creation are incomprehensible, for example. Scott Hahn, Jeff Cavins, Tim Gray, and John Bergsma, however, are capable of putting it across perfectly well in simple terms that teens could understand.

The worst part of the course, however, is the opening few minutes. He opens with a mock reading of scripture and prayer which to me is simply sacrilegious, particularly as the teens clearly think he's being serious.

He also seems to choose sexual analogies when they simply aren't justified or necessary. Like when he's talking about Leviticus he cracks two incest jokes when even one would have been too much as well as completely inappropriate.

One of the reasons I left Protestantism was because many of its speakers were more obsessed with their performance and image, than content. Mark Hart is in that mould, and sadly more and more Catholic speakers are behaving like Protestants.

Quite frankly, I wouldn't hesitate showing teens Ascension's adult series - 'The Great Adventure Bible Timeline' - by Jeff Cavins as they wouldn't have difficulty understanding it.

A truly dreadful series and a complete waste of money.",1379894400,,1354,4.942731277533039
7801628,5,193292776X,"I just recently bought this bible study on DVD for catechesis for my daughter who goes to a public high school. I felt we needed to work on our understanding of our faith and I know that she has enjoyed Mark Hart's lessons before in a teen group she belongs to. So we have gotten into the first couple of lessons and I love it! She even likes it and I don't get the ""attitude"" when I say on Sunday, ok, lets do our bible study lesson. I am even learning from his approach and it makes so much sense and puts things in logical order for retaining the information. I would highly recommend this to any teen or adult. Mark has a great sense of humor which helps engage the teens in the information he is giving them. Each year I look for something different to use for approaching the needed catechesis in these impressionable years while I still have her home to instruct. Perhaps Mark you can come up with some apologetic program for these Catholic teens that I can use for next year, her senior year. Kuddos Mark!",1318032000,3,1013,4.30890052356021
7801629,5,193292776X,I have done this study three times with high schoolers and adults. I get something new out of it each time I watch it. It is incredibly informative and thought-provoking. I have not met anyone who did not love it.,1317945600,,213,4.35
7801630,5,193292776X,This is an entertaining way to learn Bible history.  It's a great tool for teens and adults.  I would recommend this series.,1291334400,,124,4.590909090909091
7801631,5,193292776X,"Our church is using this series for confirmation.  What a great presentation!  I'm learning along with my teen.  The theology is sound, and the presenter is so engaging.  One caveat:  he talks FAST.  He has a ""no accent accent"", so that's not an issue.  Make sure you have a good sound system or too much gets lost if you have to think too hard about understanding what he said.  Then the meaning gets lost.  The kids seem to be enjoying it, too, in spite of themselves.",1231286400,,470,4.372093023255814
