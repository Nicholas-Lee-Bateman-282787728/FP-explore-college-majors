Recommended!",1335225600,2,227,4.82051282051282
8209395,5,B000TGUN48,"After reading the comments by B. Hall, I was compelled to write a comment in support of Mr. Gemeiner's excellent dvd on the cane for combat.  I should have written a comment several years ago when I first bought this dvd, but that said I will comment now.  Let me say that I've referred to this dvd many, many times over the years and continue to get more and more from each viewing.  Truly it's a gift that keeps on giving.

Due to tennis elbow it is very difficult for me at times to wield the cane one handed from the high guard for any appreciable amount of time, so this method isn't particularity for me.  In addition, I favor a heavier stick (hanbo, in fact), because, for me anyway, it has more impact potential than a lighter stick and, can be wielded well with both hands or one hand using the reverse grip method or going from one grip to another.

It was only after viewing Craig's superb dvd that I became really comfortable and confident with using my hanbo for combat.  The manner in which Craig integrates hand striking and kicking with the cane is another big plus to this dvd.  I really appreciate that he didn't waste my time or money by getting into any grappling and throwing crap which would be very, very difficult to do under real combat conditions anyway.

Another thing which I really appreciate is that Craig uses a straight cane and not the crook cane which seems to dominate the market.  Thanks Craig! To put it simply, Craig's cane work is simple, direct, and powerful and it's real life combat applicability is without question.

Finally, in regard to its production quality, this dvd is very professional and one will want to view it over and over again.  So, anyone interested in knowing how to use the cane for self-defense will be nothing less than thoroughly pleased with this dvd.  Why someone would throw this dvd in the trash just makes no sense to me.  It is my hope that Craig will put out another dvd, and soon,  exclusively on using the cane with the one hand reverse grip method.  One can only hope.",1331078400,7,2043,4.466307277628032
8209396,5,B000TGUN48,"craig is an expert in the vigny style of la canne--he demos this system that was used by the indian police force in real confrontations--top notch!--the system is not known by many but it is very deadly and used by citizens, police and the military--well presented!--ralph grasso",1331078400,3,279,4.957446808510638
8209397,1,B000TGUN48,"i was so excited to get this, and i was very disappointed and bord to death watching, first of all the quality is aweful i don't no who done the filming but it was bad, really bad, like a bootleg,that has been bootlegged 10times, plus the whole so called technique leaves you open for a full attack, but if you just want to do sword fighting with a stick for playing around it would be a great dvd is you can make out the picture, so if your looking for protection ""real protection"" look elsewhere, i wasted 50.00 on this that will more than likly end up in the garbage.",1330300800,,570,4.1909090909090905
