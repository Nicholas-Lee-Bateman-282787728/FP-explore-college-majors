8235722,3,B000ZJXFA8,"overall this is a good dvd, not a great dvd. I wish You Knew and Can't Let Go were not sung right through, Can't let go was apruptly ended to make an anouncement of the Boyz 2 Men/Mariah duet, it was as though only a certain length of time was allowed to be recorded onto dvd and so in the editing process they were cut short or Mariah delibrately did that I am not sure, it seems to be a bad habit on the part of the production team or Mariah on her dvds, which is something to be irked about. also where was Mariah's song with snoop dogg, say somethin' or Get your number, Circles or So Lonely, it is the mimi concert afterall.  It has some good features such as behind the scenes and a jukebox feature to play just the songs that you want to hear. Disc two has the adventures of mimi tour, documentary, lovers and haters and karaoke style feature, but in saying that I felt more enthusis was placed on the features rather than the concert, it should of had more songs, played in full, more focus on Mariah, more interesting choreography.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madonna-The-Confessions-Tour/dp/B000KGGLCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madonna - The Confessions Tour</a>&nbsp;is an example of an awesome live tour and also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showgirl-The-Greatest-Hits-Tour/dp/B000CPGZHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour</a>.

A Dvd collection of all her singles, video clips, (not just concert versions like on number 1's) that would be better, it would be the Ideal Mariah Carey Dvd not these others she has been thurning out, sorry Mariah. I like Mariah Careys' songs so that made it o.k, but it could have been better.
