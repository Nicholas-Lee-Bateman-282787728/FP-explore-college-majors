6184750,1,B00HND2Y5G,"It was with great enthusiasm that I purchased this Doggie Entertainment DVD after looking at the specifics, however I was greatly disappointed....as was my dog.  Apparently there is a ""high volume sound"" that runs throughout the disc that only the dog can hear.  And our dog hears the sound but doesn't connect it with what is happening on the TV screen.  Consequently he runs around the house like crazy looking for the sound.  The only time he shows any interest in the DVD is when a dog actually barks.  There are some dogs shown, but many wild animals and birds....and they do not make any sounds.  My dog has no interest in zebras and lions.  It is virtually a silent DVD and our dog couldn't have cared less....and it was boring for us adults.  Our dog actually likes television....especially when barking dogs are on it.  But this Doggie Entertainment did absolutely nothing for him.  Personally, I feel like I threw my money away purchasing it.  The dog thinks so too!",1277337600,14,976,4.682352941176471
6184751,4,B00HND2Y5G,My Shih Tzu begins by barking and running up to the speakers and would jump at the screen if it weren't over the fireplace. Then she wears herself out and curls up to sleep. I would have given it five stars but the intro runs to long before the action. Then on the repeat play option it runs through the intro completely again. That intro has no action to it or animal activity.,1277164800,8,378,4.191780821917808
6184752,5,B00HND2Y5G,So funny!  I can't believe I am saying this but my dog is a movie junkie now.  My cat even liked it. Good purchase.,1275523200,,115,3.75
6184753,5,B00HND2Y5G,I heard wonderful reviews about Doggie Entertainment from a friend who also bought this DVD on Amazon. And she was right.  My 3 year old boxer Maxwell absolutely loved it.  He already perks his head up when animals come up on the TV so this video was pure entertainment for him.  I would 100% recommend this DVD for anyone with DOGS.  Your dog will just love it.  Lots of different animals to keep entertained.,1269561600,5,410,4.486486486486487
8633667,5,B00HND2Y5G,I couldn't believe how effective this video was! My dog loved it!,1452038400,,65,4.5
8633668,3,B00HND2Y5G,My dog started watching it and then got afraid. He ran around the living room and then urinated on a chair (marking territory!). I turned it off! Will try it again in smaller doses  since he does love to watch the critters out doors.,1425513600,,233,4.295454545454546
8633669,5,B00HND2Y5G,this does the job keeping my yorkies entertained when I have to leave them alone.  They seem calmer when I return and not as needy.,1400025600,,131,4.24
8633670,1,B00HND2Y5G,A waste of money. So disappointing. Neither dogs or humans had any interest in watching this product. Similar to Puppy Bowl.,1378598400,,124,4.9523809523809526
8633671,2,B00HND2Y5G,"great concept , but my dog was not very interested . I videoed him during the day , and he chose to sit on my bed and sulk",1366848000,,122,3.392857142857143
8633672,1,B00HND2Y5G,"This is by far the worst dog DVD I have purchased.  The only time either of my dogs even looked towards the TV was at the very beginning when the screen was blue with white print and the piano music in the background seemed to be what one dog was interested in for about 5 seconds!  Really haven't had great luck with any dog DVD, not like my cats with the original Cat Sitter DVD.",1363132800,,381,4.066666666666666
8633673,4,B00HND2Y5G,The video has many sounds and video of different places to keep my dog occupied.  Might of liked to see videos of other dogs.,1362096000,,125,4.208333333333333
8633674,5,B00HND2Y5G,My dogs love this. It is a great deal! It was an excellent price and came on time and in perfect condition. I highly recommend this product and seller.,1357516800,,151,4.241379310344827
8633675,2,B00HND2Y5G,"The only part my dog pays any attention to is the barking; her ears perk up and she sniffs the TV for a couple seconds, but that's it.  I haven't tried any other dog movies, maybe it works for certain dogs, but not mine.",1334966400,2,220,4.0
8633676,5,B00HND2Y5G,"This DVD is wonderful.

It keeps my dog riveted to the TV set for the entire program:)

I don't know how many times my dog will view this before it gets bored with it though.  I'm going to try only once a week and see how it works out:)

Here are some suggestions to the maker of the DVD:

1).  There needs to be more Dog Barking Sounds of different types.  There isn't really enough of them.

2).  The Dog Bark Sounds need to be louder.  Most are too soft.  You can turn up your speakers however.

3).  For the Dog, the TV or Flatscreen should be dog height, not up on a wall. I'd say whatever your using, the bottom of it should be no higher than a foot or two off the floor.

Other than these minor problems, the DVD seems to be working out great:)",1297296000,,751,3.9864864864864864
