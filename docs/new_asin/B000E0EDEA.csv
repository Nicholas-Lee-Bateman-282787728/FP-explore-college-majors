8103111,4,B000E0EDEA,"I rented ""Street Angel"" because it was an early Oscar-winner (1927-28).  Janet Gaynor was awarded Best Actress for her role in three movies that year, including ""Street Angel"".  I had seen the other two films and they were very good as well.  What impressed me the most about ""Street Angel"" was a sequence of scenes early in the movie.  There was an important part of the story that the director, Frank Borzage, chose to depict in shadows and it was as good as anything similar that Hitchcock or any other director has done.  Those scenes alone were worth the price of admission.  As for the rest of the movie, it is a cut above the standard romance.  However, the promise of the beginning faded in the subsequent story.",1263686400,2,720,4.578125

""You are....To me."" - Gino

Like all the great masters, Frank Borzage could use his palette to texture and shade the colors of each picture he created so that something new and wonderful emerged on each canvas. But also like those great artists of the past, a distinctive style and theme could always be found in his work that tied the artist forever to his creations. Something fresh and different takes shape in this beautiful silent film, yet within this charming and romantic story filled with atmosphere, themes so inherently Borzage emerge. It marks this lovely silent classic, which helped both Borzage and Janet Gaynor win the Academy Award, as belonging to the greatest romanticist film has ever seen. Street Angel is a sentimental work of art, painted in soft focus on nitrate, in black and white, having an enduring beauty and message which is timeless.

Set in Naples, Italy, lushly painted backdrops blend with lovely sets, creating an illusion so real the smell of freshly baked bread and romantic violins playing wash over the viewer like a gentle Tuscan shower. Once again, as in Seventh Heaven, Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor are a match made in film heaven. Charles Farrell is even more splendid than in the former pairing of the two stars, and is astoundingly good. The magic between director Borzage and star Gaynor picks up where it left off, she the extension of the artist, the brush with which he paints his masterpiece. Street Angel is most definitely one of the great films of the silent era. It is every bit the film Seventh Heaven is, its sentiment and message as lovely and heartfelt upon viewing it today as it was when it was new.

The first time we see Gaynor (Angela), she is caring for a sick mother in need of medicine she cannot afford. Gaynor is simply wondrous as Borzage frames her in soft focus, the audience able to see her heart breaking as her only glimmer of hope is on the street below, where an innocent and inexperienced Angela must attempt to sell the only thing she has of value. Melancholy imbues what follows, an uncomfortable and unsure Angela endeavoring to mimic the experienced Lisetta (Natalie Kingston) so clumsily she is forced to steal in a moment of panic and is caught by the Italian police. She escapes in a wild chase and is hidden among the circus performers by a kind Masetto (Henry Armetta). Heartbreakingly too late to save her mother, she makes her home among the travelers, the gypsy fortune teller's cards predicting romance for Angela, who wants nothing to do with love at all. In this way, Borzage has reversed the roles of the couple in Seventh Heaven.

Up to this juncture, the tenderness and sad human heartbreak reality can bring to bear upon the living has been rendered beautifully, as only Borzage was capable of showing. But suddenly he uses his palette to paint light and beauty, and humor, opening up the heavens for Angela with great charm in the form of Gino. Charles Farrell is often overlooked for the fine actor he was, overshadowed perhaps by the lovely and adorable Gaynor during their many pairings together. He had a marvelous sense of humor about it, as was evidenced in a Jack Benny radio skit years later. Here he is fabulous, full of charm and the perfect match for Angela, who says pooh on love until the brash artist with charisma paints her as he sees her in his heart. The shots of her sitting for him are gorgeous and romantic, the settings by Harry Oliver and framing by Borzage filled with a lush beauty and atmosphere rarely captured on nitrate or celluloid. It is in these romantic scenes especially that the viewer feels like he is in Italy.

When she breaks her ankle, they will leave behind the circus to return to Naples, and danger for Angela, who cannot let the innocent Gino know she was arrested as a girl of the streets. The lovely soundtrack blends with the tune Gino whistles, and creates one of the most moving moments in film history, as she chokes up trying to answer his whistle, desperately trying to leave her sweet Gino unaware that a policeman has remembered her, and given her only a short reprieve from custody. It is then that Borzage returns to his theme of otherworldly love, and how it is faith that often makes that light of love in our hearts possible. The film is far from over, however, with some extraordinarily dark moments still ahead. The light will not break through to correct the wrong until it has almost been eclipsed, it's bright rays finally appearing miraculously, befitting the setting. Borzage leaves the impression that Gino and Angela were led to this moment, this place, by some higher power, to protect a love not belonging to the tangible world, but in a heart full of faith.

This is a beautiful and charming film with a romantic depth that could never be equaled today. It is a romantic and tear-stained flower to true love and beauty, and being able to see with our heart what is in the heart of another that truly makes them beautiful. Farrell is marvelous here, and it is almost a shame Janet Gaynor made Sunrise, Seventh Heaven, and Street Angel in such close proximity. She surely would have received an Oscar three years in a row rather than only one, for these magnificent performances. Borzage garnered another a few years later for Bad Girl, but could easily have ended up with three, by that same token. The print is very good on this version, and the sound excellent. Like all great works of art, there is more here than a cursory look can discern, and the longer you look the more you begin to feel the rich and detailed colors which make up this sensitive and sentimental portrait of love in its truest form. A masterwork of silent cinema.",1247443200,8,5763,4.661750245821042
