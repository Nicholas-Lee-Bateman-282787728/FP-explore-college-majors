7912558,5,B00000JLWU,"I know this plea will fall on deaf ears, but please release or re-release more Dan Curtis movies on DVD. I saw this on T.V. a long time ago and never forgot it. It's a fun 1970's made for T.V. creature feature.",1484697600,,210,4.023809523809524
7912559,4,B00000JLWU,"I remembered this movie as very scary and full of suspense! Loved it!! The actors were superb! I would have given this movie a full 5 star rating if
it weren't for the fact that the VSH playback was not as sharp as a DVD.",1456963200,,221,3.933333333333333
7912560,5,B00000JLWU,"CURSE OF THE BLACK WIDOW opens w/ the bizarre, brutal death of a man in a bar parking lot. Patron Mark Higbie (Tony Franciosa- TENEBRE), who also happens to be a private investigator, finds the body, and also sees something very strange. Enter Leigh Lockwood (Donna Mills- PLAY MISTY FOR ME), who wants Higbie to find the killer. Of course, this is a Dan Curtis (THE NORLISS TAPES, THE NIGHT STRANGLER, TRILOGY OF TERROR) film, so this is no ordinary killer! Police Lt. Gully Conti (Vic Morrow- THE EVICTORS, HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP) and Officer Ragsdale (Max Gail- TV's BARNEY MILLER) are busy trying to cover up whatever happened. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman is changing into a hideous creature, and draining her male victims of blood! This could have something to do w/ either an ancient Chinese legend, or a native american curse. Yep, all the elements of a 1970's, made-for-TV monster movie are here! I especially like the big beast-y and the webbed cadavers she leaves behind! COTBW is another triumph for Curtis, who dominated TV terror of the era. Co-stars Patty Duke (SHE WAITS) as Leigh's sister, Laura Lockwood, and June Lockhart (SHE WOLF OF LONDON, TV's LOST IN SPACE) as Mrs. Lockwood. Highly recommended for the fiend fanatic...",1454803200,,1245,4.9052132701421804
7912561,5,B00000JLWU,"Patty Duke does a great job in Curse Of The Black Widow. Donna Mills provides nice support. If you like thriller television films of the 1970's, this ones for you, a very enjoyable B-Film.",1375920000,3,188,4.5588235294117645
7912562,5,B00000JLWU,I really liked this movie when it was on TV.  I couldn't remember the full name until I found it here on Amazon.com.  I purchased a copy and love it.  It does look different now that I am older....but I still love it.,1147737600,5,217,4.0
7912563,3,B00000JLWU,"I've always been up for an on going spider situation. This time there is no clown. Except maybe behind the camera, heh, heh. This is the usual Dan Curtis formula. Body turns up drained of blood. Murders go back years. Cops don't want to look foolish, they surpress information, etc. An intrepid reporter/private detective who won't take no for an answer. Old cob webbed houses that are soon to have either a broken window or a fire insurance claim. Some comedy. It stars Tony Franc...damn it, I can never say that name. Maybe film producers had the same problem which is why he sunk all the way down to this. ""Who cares what he's called....hire him! Tell him it's a dollar an hour.""

Direction is sloppy. Actors either don't know their lines or are misguidedly using the method. Have to love the plot, though. Honestly, it's appalling the rubbish I watch.

This should be released on DVD with a free green spider pendant. It's bound to be green. They never get these things right.",1115856000,6,980,4.626436781609195
7912564,3,B00000JLWU,"Dan Curtis , of ""Dark Shadows"" fame ,made this TV movie as a contractual obligation to ABC-TV and it was originally to have involved the great Harlan Ellison as a writer .The project was then known as Dark Destroyer but sad to say absolutely nothing remains of Ellison's proposed involvement in the project

The story is perfectly functional for the type of movie it is -a woman finds that during the cycle of the moon she turns into a giant blood drinking spider,the result of an ancient Native American curse

Tony Franciosa is good as a private investigator caught up in the plot and there is sturdy ,professional support from Jeff Corey as a shaman and from Vic Morrow as  a cynical cop .

The weaknesses of the venture are an impoverished  script and some woeful special effects which stop it rising above the mundane .

Watchable if you are not in too demanding a mood",1106352000,2,874,4.57051282051282
7912565,5,B00000JLWU,"Academy Award winner, Patty Duke, transforms herself for this tailor-made role in ""Curse of the Black Widow"". She is visiting her twin sister, Donna Mills, when a serial killer strikes.  Tony Franciosa plays the central character who is trying to untangle the web of horror.
This movie has all the feel of 1977.  The music and characters reflect the era well.  There's a large cast and snappy dialogue. There's plenty of suspense and startling moments.
I viewed the VHS digitally mastered collector's edition.  It's like it claims, ""optimum picture and sound.""",1014854400,14,560,5.1208791208791204
