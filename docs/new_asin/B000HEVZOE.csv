8139625,5,B000HEVZOE,More interesting information on the Sinking of the Andrea Doria than you'll get from any other source.,1484006400,,102,5.0588235294117645
8139626,5,B000HEVZOE,Very interesting documentary.  The ship sank only a few miles from where I was living at the time.  This explained a lot.,1464739200,,121,4.454545454545454
8139627,4,B000HEVZOE,"""Secrets of the Dead: The Sinking of the 'Andrea Doria'"" is a very good general overview of the ""Andrea Doria"" and the accident that so famously claimed her. This is part of the PBS ""Secrets of the Dead"" series that discusses fateful and fatal events in history. The series is a mixed bag, and much of the success of this 2006 episode is owed to an Italian documentary, ""Il Naufragio Dell'Andrea Doria"", directed by Fabio Toncelli (also credited as director here) which shares much of the footage and interviews seen here. While the ""Secrets of the Dead"" editing is interesting, there are really no secrets exposed, as all of the salient points have been made before. Having said that, the footage of the ""Doria"" is beautiful and it does serve as a useful introduction to the ship and the historical significance she held for the postwar Italian maritime industry.

Strong points of this production are the interviews with surviving officers of both the ""Andrea Doria"" and ""Stockholm"" and the succinct explanation of the collision, the investigation, and the aftermath of the accident. The reenactments are good with generally quite good acting, and the CGI recreations of the ship look good even though they are far from photorealistic. I think Toncelli treated both the Italian and Swedish crews fairly, and the interviews reflected the even keel nature of the production; the interviews with surviving passengers were very tastefully done and brought the calamity of the night of July 25-26, 1956 home in human terms in a way that reading about it never could.

If I had to choose one DVD to watch on the ""Andrea Doria"" I would without hesitation pick ""Il Naufragio Dell'Andrea Doria"", which is a longer documentary that is more subtly nuanced than this adaptation, but for those seeking a more condensed and accessible documentary using much of the same footage and requiring no translations or subtitles, ""Secrets of the Dead: The Sinking of the 'Andrea Doria'"" is a fine choice.",1441411200,2,1984,4.954954954954955

8139629,5,B000HEVZOE,Fascinating video seen through two divers who dove to the Andrea Doria wreck. They made gave some very logical reasons why the collision occurred and why it shouldn't have happened at all.,1421712000,,188,4.90625
8139630,5,B000HEVZOE,"""The Sinking of the Andrea Doria"", part of PBS's ""Secrets of the Dead"" series, looks at the life and the untimely death of the Italian luxury liner in the modern era - even though equipped with radar.

The DVD did a very good job of setting the stage, showing the SS Andrea Doria as more than a ship. It was also meant to showcase a resurgent Italy after WWII by projecting an image of the luxurious, well built and modern passenger liner during what would be the last era of trans-Atlantic passenger liners. During one foggy day off the coast of North America, the Doria would meet its fate at the hands of the SS Stockholm.

The DVD has interviews with crew of both the Doria and the Stockholm. The crisis point when action by either ship would have averted disaster is evaluated as two large ships sailed directly at each other and, by a chain of freak events, collided even though both ships had radar and had identified each other miles away!

Though the 1st officer of the Stockholm with its deadly, reinforced bow - meant to go through winter ice of it's home port - denied any wrong doing till his death, it is most likely that the Stockholm was at fault. There is also blame assigned to the captain of the Dora for not slowing down more while in the fog.

The rescue effort, led by the SS Isle de France which raced to the scene and several smaller ships, was caught for all eternity by motion picture cameras for all the world to see. The mortally wounded Italian liner with it's side caved in was at such a list that the life boats on one side of the ship couldn't be used. Regardless, the rescue efforts were largely successful and the modern liner stayed afloat, though holed in one side and listing badly.

I thought this DVD gave the subject a very good evaluation, with much period film footage of the SS Andrea Doria. It showed it to be an elegant ship that met an untimely - and easily averted - tragic end. I recommend this DVD with five stars.",1386201600,7,1963,4.381868131868132
8139631,5,B000HEVZOE,I am old enough to remember the Andrea Doria. This is the only documentary about this subject that I have ever seen. This was a fascinaing documentary.,1366588800,6,151,4.62962962962963
8139632,2,B000HEVZOE,Exactly what -- are any? -- secrets derived from the dead?  Why not show us more details regarding the explanation that the Italian Skipper wasn't responsible whereas the Swedish crew muffed it? Louis J Sheehan,1198368000,10,210,5.0
