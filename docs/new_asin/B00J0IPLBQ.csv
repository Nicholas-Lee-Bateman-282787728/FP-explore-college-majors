6308281,5,B00J0IPLBQ,"This is a movie worth seeing, one of those movies where the acting is so sharp (Reese Witherspoon barely looks like herself) and the townspeople so very real. It is an American story, told with precision and painstaking attention to character detail. I had seen the documentary, which is also very well done, and this film not only does not disappoint, but adds additional narrative elements to the interpretation of events. Great acting, unflinching performances.",1400198400,2,464,5.2
6308282,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"This is an interesting movie. It is difficult to watch and really don't like having to think about things like this. It really makes you know if you serve on a jury, you better get the facts straight and ponder everything about what lawyers are saying. I did enjoy watching Colin Firth act, he is a cut above most actors.",1400112000,2,321,4.366666666666666

6308284,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"I rated ""Devil's Knot"" 4/5. This is mostly because it was a good story to start out with, but I also like how the movie highlights some important issues. It reminds us of those times in human history that we aren't so proud of. Like the Holocaust, the treatment of Native Americans, the Salem Witch trials, McCarthyism, etc., etc. The movie delivers a message similar to the Lord of the Flies but offers a true story as evidence instead of a concept.  ""Devil's Knot"" also points out serious flaws in our justice system. These murders didn't happen that long ago. This should warn us that this dark part of human nature will always be with us.

I should mention that I have not seen ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills,"" or the three follow up films, so that might affect my opinion.  Since I am not previously familiar with the story, I have to agree with the other reviewers who mentioned that it jumps between different periods of time a lot. I found that hard to follow.  There are also a lot of different characters, names, and changing testimonies to keep track of.  I had to rewind a lot.

Overall I enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it.  I am glad I got to hear this story, and the film inspired me to learn even more about the story.  I definitely plan to watch the documentary versions so I can get a more detailed, nonfiction version of events, learn exactly how this travesty happened, and get to know all the characters involved in greater depth.

I think it is good for everyone, especially the justice system, to be periodically reminded of humanitys past mistakes.  This story documents a tragic injustice within the US legal system as well as numerous dangerous group behavior psychology issues.  As humans we must always be vigilant in holding our morals and values over conformity.  The presumption of innocence is the foundation of our criminal legal system.  As Benjamin Franklin said in 1785 it is better 100 guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should suffer.",1399766400,,2027,4.660112359550562

6308286,3,B00J0IPLBQ,"""If you don't have a strong case the state is gonna kill 3 young men and I can't stand by and watch that happen."" In 1993 three 8 year old boys were savagely murdered. The state tried three teenagers as adults for the killings and claimed they were murdered as part of a satanic cult ritual. This is the story of the trial and how Ron Lax (Firth) tried to help the defense and how one of the mother's (Witherspoon) dealt with the loss and aftermath. I knew very little of the actual story going in. This is a movie that reminded me of the Aviator in the way that I watched a documentary and read more about the events after it was over and found those to be better and more interesting then the movie. The cast is great and has many big names as well as 3 Oscar winners, but at best this felt like a made-for-TV movie. I found it hard to really get into and was disappointed especially with this cast. I'm not saying it's not worth seeing but if you get a chance read and watch anything else on the West Memphis Three, you will be more informed and more interested then you would if you watch this movie. Overall, not bad but could have been so much better. I give this a B-.",1399766400,,1175,4.135371179039302

6308288,5,B00J0IPLBQ,"Atom Egoyan directs a screenplay written by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson based on the book `The Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three' written by Mara Leveritt that outlines one of the more gruesome murder stories as well as a gross mismanagement of a judicial trial that makes of a film that grinds at our gut long after the credits detail share the aftermath of this heinous incident.

May 5, 1993 three young boys - Chris Byers (Brandon Spink), Michael Moore (Paul Boardman, Jr) and Stevie Branch (Jet Jurgensmeyer) left together to play in the woods and never returned. Stevie's mother Pam Hobbs  (Reese Witherspoon) and father Terry (Alessandro Nivola) are the most involved at searching for their lost son, but the police too soon line up three suspects -Damien Echols (James Hamrick), Jessie Misskelley, Jr (Christopher Higgins) and Jason Baldwin (Seth Meriwether) because of their anti-social behavior and apparent Satanic cult worship (not proved), place them on trial for the murders and convicted them. The process is not unlike the Salem Witch Hunts. An investigator Ron Lax (Colin Firth) loathes the death penalty and works toward discovering the flaws in the investigation, arrest, and trial (led by Judge David Burnett as played by Bruce Greenwood) - evidence that strongly suggests that the three teens arrested were not the true perpetrators, that the real murderer may still be at large.

The Wikipedia summarizes the incident well: `The West Memphis Three are three men who were tried and convicted as teenagers in 1994 of the 1993 murders of three boys in West Memphis, Arkansas. Damien Echols was sentenced to death, Jessie Misskelley, Jr. was sentenced to life imprisonment plus two 20-year sentences, and Jason Baldwin was sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial, the prosecution asserted that the children were killed as part of a Satanic ritual. A number of documentaries have been based on the case, and celebrities and musicians have held fund raisers in the belief that they are innocent.'

In addition to the excellent performances buy Reese Witherspoon, Alessandro Nivola and Colin Firth, the supporting cast includes such luminaries as Elias Koteas, Kevin Durand, Amy Ryan, and Dane DeHaan who plays a central role as Chris Morgan. The pacing, cinematography and direction are first rate, but th e fact that this hideous crime remains essentially unsolved is the terrifying aspect of this very fine little film.

I would describe this movie, and real life event, as a modern day Salem with trial. A whole town go against a group of people because they act, look, and believe differently than the majority of the town.

6308370,5,B00J0IPLBQ,"Devil's Knot (2013) starting Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon  is a film based on real life story of the West Memphis Three murder case.  Back in the early summer of 1993 three young boys go to the nearby woods, they never come from them.  A week or so later their tied up and mutilated bodies are found at the bottom of a creek.  The townsfolk are horrified by the gruesome murders, the police quickly apprehends the ""perpetrators"" o the crime.  The three killers are also young men (teenagers) and are known in town as Satan worshipers and slackers.  Soon after the murders, a court trial follows.  A mother of one the murdered boys together with a private investigator begin to suspect that something is not right with the case against the accused three boys...the questions the film poses are: are the three accused boys the perpetrators? or is the real killer or killers still on the lose? ---POSSIBLE SPOILER !!! the film goes even further by alluding to the notion that the real killer or killers are close family members of the victims...

The director of the film Atom Egoyan is turning out to be the most interesting Canadian filmmakers of the last decade. I would also recommend
to check out his Where the Truth Lies (2005), Chloe (2009), and Captive (20014).",1452556800,,1271,4.693693693693693

Like the arrogance Damian portrayed when faced with such a horrific crime. That is typical sociopath behavior that is associated with serial killers. I will have to give this movie a little respect for not leaving a lot of that behavior out like Damian blowing kisses to the parents of the three boys that were killed in the most horrific way imaginable. Also they included Damian writing the name of Aleister Crowley in a secret code that was known to Damian and Jason. Thats like if the cops falsely accused you of cannibalism and awaiting your trail you write down the name of Jeffrey Dahmer in a secret code. Who in their right mind would do that? Aleister Crowley was known for his writings of child sacrifice for supernatural powers. Clearly you would have to be delusional to believe such things.

Three teens were arrested, tried and convicted on circumstantial evidence on the grounds they were Satanists making ritual sacrifices.

The film ""Devil's Knot"" did a nice job of summarizing the essence of the horrific abuse of the justice system; however, it should have been made longer to give more personality to the three wrongly convicted then-teenagers and the families of the victims.  In that regard, this film failed miserably. And yes, I realize the movies based on true stories are simply a dramatization and can't include everything from, but this movie could have done better.

I was tempted to give it only three stars,  but the acting was good and the screenplay was okay.  I realize how tough it is to take such a thorough 2002 book as ""Devil's Knot"" (by Mara Leveritt) and tell that story on the ""big screen,"" but I was a little disappointed. This film had a hard act to follow as the three HBO documentaries on the same subject were exceptional!

I didn't recognize her photo at all, and when I saw her name on the bill, I couldn't believe it was her.

Even during the film, she was so into that character, she looked like a completely different person.  I finally noticed, she must have gained 30 pounds for this role, and maybe had some special help in make-up, getting her mouth to turn down, etc.

If she won the Oscar  for ""Walk the LIne"", she had better get nominated for this! I think it is by far, the best performance of her career!

She IS from the south, and only has a hint of an accent.  I've heard her go back to her roots in previous films, but even her accent in this film is done with such finesse.  There are no lazy, hard ""R's"", or too much twang.  It is pronounced but subtle, if that is possible.

6308532,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"Even in the earliest part of his career Atom Egoyan had a way about his film making. Like most directors he doesn't always hit one out of the park, but there is usually something worthwhile in his films. his is no exception.

Here's the scoop. Three young boys in Memphis Arkansas go out for a bike ride one afternoon. They are found dead the next day. Three local boys are arrested and tried. A private investigator and even one of the victims' mothers, begins to doubt the guilt of the three perps.

I was just vaguely aware of this case because of the headlines linking the murders to heavy metal music and Satanism. This movie fills in the details in a nice, if un-sensationalistic manner. Egoyan tells the story in linear fashion and seems to stick close as to what actually happened. He sub-titles various events that occurred during the search for the boys and the subsequent arrest and trial of the perps. He makes it plain this is a God-fearing part of the country that has little room or tolerance for any free-thinking individuals. Reese Withserspoon does a decent job but needs to be commended on allowing herself to be shown as a frumpy housewife. Colin Firth is Okay but you've seen him better. There are a lot of faces in supporting roles you'll recognize from any number of other films. There is good use of location and Egoyan frames some great shots.

On the downside is the fact that reality doesn't always make for good storytelling or film making. I applaud his decision to keep this on a lower key but that might be what held it back from being a better viewing experience. Others have complained it added nothing new to what was already known. Well....since I knew nothing of the case I can't make that complaint. It also seems the case just sort of petered out. The boys were convicted but, when evidence arose that pointed in other directions, little seems to have been done about it. So the movie sort of fizzles out at the end.

I might be a bit generous in giving it 4 stars but, for my dollar, it's better than 3. If you like real life crime drams, you could do a lot worse.",1407369600,,2103,4.483028720626632

However, those who have followed the case for years will probably find it lacking in depth and character development. Colin Firth and Reece Witherspoon are good, as always, but certainly not great either. I had no problems with their accents, and I visit relatives in Arkansas frequently. All actors, and there are other good ones in here, did what they could with what was given to them by the writers. Like another reviewer, I felt that you did not see a lot of West Memphis or Arkansas in the movie, because it was shot in Georgia. That bothered me somewhat, as I am familiar with the area. What the movie did show well was the lack of quality policy work and a rush to judgment in convicting 3 young boys who were a little different. For those who have become interested in the case after watching this movie, I would definitely recommend the book ""Devil's Knot"". It goes into much greater detail and is very well researched. There is also a lot of information on the internet, as well as some documentaries, especially the ""Paradise Lost"" Series, of which the 1. installment is the best, as well as the documentary ""West of Memphis"".",1406592000,,1249,4.555555555555555

I highly recommend reading the book first and using the film to help visualize the layers of ignorance, hysteria and prejudice that led to this horrific crime. Atom does a good job of portraying the fact that in this sleepy (but not atypical) little Arkansas town, the societal need for closure outweighed the desire for justice.

There is still so much more to this unsolved mystery that has yet to be put together. Reading the book and watching the film make you a participant in the search for the real killer(s). If you feel unsettled after this move, you got the point. The only thing left to decide is which is more unsettling, the fact that the murderer(s) are still out there, or that the Arkansas justice system (and by extension the community) satisfied itself by jailing three innocent boys for so long.",1405987200,6,913,4.70625

Egoyan does sensitive work, and this is no exception, but I think its greatest appeal is to an audience who knows nothing about this case.  It was so well-publicized that those kinds of viewers are hard to come by.
It does not resolve anything It just leaves some of the strange and awful things that happened in this little community and to these people, up in the air.
Colin Firth is quite fine in it, but his character seemed unnecessary.  He was meant, I am sure, to be the reasonable doubter who tries to sort out the facts.  In so doing, he is the representative of the viewer.  He ends up not getting much to do, though his character is based on a real person.  (And his Southern accent is perfectly fine.)
Everyone else is quite good.  I have no complaints.  Reese Witherspoon is always good and there are some nice, small roles from others that are quite compelling.

That being said, I thought Reese Witherspoon did an admirable job portraying Pam Hobbs.  For me, no parent of the murdered boys touched me more - perhaps because there was so much footage of her in the news/documentaries and she seemingly wore her heart on her sleeve.

Bottom line is that I don't think this movie was made for those of us who were hooked/shocked upon the first seeing of Paradise Lost when it showed on HBO so long ago.  We already know too much and most of us decided long ago about the innocence of the convicted. Still, I am glad I saw the film.

I think the movie was made for those people who know little to nothing about this case.  Perhaps the presence of Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth will get some of those unaware butts into the theatres to learn about this case.

Setting that aside, please believe me that the documentaries tell this story much better than the movie. The real people in the documentaries are far more riveting than the actors in this film. Much more detail is covered over the several installments of the documentaries. However, a fair warning: the documentaries and the movie will both haunt you for the rest of your days and you'll see things that you can't un-see.

6308588,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"In 1996, HBO produced a documentary, ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"", about the much-publicized murder case of three young boys, Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers, who were murdered in the wooded creeks called Robin Hood Hills near West Memphis, Arkansas. The local authorities were convinced the murders were enacted by three older male teens, Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley, Jr., and Jason Baldwin. According to the present film and the HBO documentaries, they were targeted by authorities as suspects in a kind of modern-day witch-hunt because of their interest in the occult, horror films, and Heavy Metal music. Echols was often seen wearing black clothing, an affront to the predominant Christian community of West Memphis. He later admitted to reading about Aleister Crowley but asserted he had never read any of Crowley's actual writings.

The case against the three teens hinged primarily on the notion that the murders were committed as a kind of sacrifice in a satanic ritual. Also, dubious testimony, particularly that of Vicki Hutcheson and her son Aaron, was later recanted. Hutcheson claimed initially that she had seen the three teens involved in Satanic rituals and that Damien Eckles had bragged about committing the murders at the event. She later said she had been coerced by police to offer false evidence, fearing authorities might take away her son. Her son Aaron in a video-taped interview said he had seen the actual murders, but then later when he was older withdrew his testimony claiming he knew nothing about the crimes. Other evidence, such as the possible involvement of an African-American who ended up in the ladies' room and smeared blood on the walls at Bojangles Restaurant the night of the murders was never adequately followed up on. No actual physical evidence linked the boys with the murders. Their prosecution was mainly based on circumstantial evidence concerning their interest in the occult.

Twenty years after the convictions of the so-called ""West Memphis Three"" and 17 years after the HBO Documentary ""Paradise Lost"", the film ""the Devil's Knot"" based on the book of the same name was released, starring Colin Firth as Ron Lax, a private investigator who became interested in the case, and Reese Witherspoon as Pamela Hobbs, the mother of victim Stevie Branch. First off, the film is beautifully shot. The lush swampy areas portraying the Robin Hood Hills appear almost like photos you might see in a postcard. The night shots are particularly beautiful, although simultaneously horrific as the setting for the brutal murders.

Critics claimed the film didn't add anything new to the understanding of the case, but I don't believe this was the filmmakers' intentions. The point of the film I believe was simply to tell the story in a dramatic/narrative format rather than a documentary. (HBO produced three documentaries in all about the case and probably assisted in the revelation about the poor police investigation, the witch-hunt sensibilities towards members of their community interested in the occult, and the dubious testimonies which led eventually to the release of the West Memphis Three.) Apart from whether or not audiences will believe the West Memphis Three are guilty or innocent, much of the film is about the complexity of such cases. Unless a defendant truthfully confesses to a crime, many questions and strange circumstances surround most cases. In many instances, the whole truth may be nearly unobtainable, such as questions which still surround the JFK Assassination.

An excellent and underrated film. The main reasons ""The Devil's Knot"" works as well as it does is because of the fine acting, particularly Witherspoon, Firth, and an honorable mention to James Hamrick as Damien Echols, the wonderful direction, and also because of the film's point of view. The film shows both sides of the case. The local authorities were pressured by the community to find the three teens guilty since a rift between conservative Christians and those interested in the occult was growing wider. In the film, one character states that those interested in the occult were bound to become enmeshed in a crime case sooner or later. Of course, the most informative details can be found in the three HBO documentaries, ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"" (1996), ""Paradise Lost 2: Revelations"" (2000), and ""Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory"" (2011).",1404777600,,4459,5.19749652294854

6308602,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"We moved from the Philadelphia area to Tennessee in the very late 1970's.  This case was covered by the news in Tennessee even though it took place across the border in Arkansas.  I remember quite clearly that I thought that the case was pushed to a conviction at that time by the news and that it was somewhat likely a miscarriage of justice had occurred.  But, being relatively conservative and having a new family,  I had a life to live and it was a story that just bothered me but not to the extent I felt compelled to do something about it.  Besides it was in another state and I did not have access to all of the details.  Years later, I watched a documentary on the case that reminded me of the concern I had that these boys were railroaded.  This film came very close to the facts presented in the documentary, but in all fairness was less supportive of a specific answer.  Because truth only spilled out occasionally after the sentencing of the boys, it was not sufficient to keep up public interest.  I do not know who was guilty in this terrible crime, but I am sure that the standard of reasonable doubt was never met because of social and political pressure necessary to find guilt, whether or not it was present.  Since there was no organized group willing to spend money, time and effort in their defense, they got a bad trial even though the accused and the victims were all young boys.  Our system of justice is still one of the best on earth, but sometimes it fails because of human management that will forever be subject to the prejudice of human nature.  While the convicted boys lost a significant portion of the most enjoyable and productive parts of their lives, they did not lose the chance to eventually and partially overcome what their society had done to them.  I believe the demand for swift punishment and the pressures it put on the court, prosecutors and police was the driver in this instance when it should have been the protection of society that should have been the deciding factor in sentencing.  Punishment and revenge cannot be our overriding goals.  We need to focus upon what measures are necessary to give reasonable protection to society that we will be protected from those most likely to commit crimes again.  This is a difficult goal and full of uncertainty in practice.  But, if we do not believe that such a goal is substantially preferable and possible a vast majority of the time, why not just adopt Sharia law as a simple primitive alternative?",1403308800,4,2497,4.575280898876405

6308604,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"I didn't see the apparently more comprehensive account given in the ""Paradise Lost"" series, so this movie has been my only exposure to the facts surrounding the case of the  Arkansas murder of three little boys who went out for a bike ride in the woods. The film has a somber, fated tone that drew me in from the start. I felt it presented a good summary of the twists and turns the case took before and after the conviction of three local teenagers presumed to have been involved with satanic worship. But as with real life, the movie doesn't present any easy answers. Suspicions continue to float in as complicated a pattern as the curls and eddies taken by the actual stream where the boys' bodies were found.

The film generally takes a low-key approach, but is shocking nonetheless. Of course there is the shock of the murders themselves. But then it is shocking to see how readily the town's people settle for the first answer that comes their way implicating the ""weirdo Goth"" kids in town. So eager are most people for some resolution, that they accept what immediately seems to be the most obvious answer, and then they hysterically defend that position even after more complicating evidence comes to light. This comes close to being a study in mob vengeance.

The biggest shock in this film though is seeing how further clues point to the possibility of the guilt of so many other people in town, people who on the surface seemed to be good, upstanding citizens. We've seen that to be the case with so many high profile cases. It turns out that all sorts of local people have been leading angry, deranged lives under their faade of backyard barbecue normalcy. But no matter how many times true crime accounts reveal tangled, far-flung skeins of motive, it is always and ever shocking to encounter such widespread malevolence yet again.

If you don't have the time or inclination to probe further into this case, this movie will provide you with a good, intelligent account of the crime and its surrounding circumstances.",1403308800,,2030,4.7259887005649714

I was disappointed thought about the cope out from the state of Arkansas and the Alfred Plea, the lack of courage and the amount of greed that state held since they did not do the right thing and exonerate these three for crimes they never committed and for being locked up because of a witch hunt; spending the better part of their youth behind bars.  Can you imagine being locked away from family and friends, life and love for eighteen long years!?  Luckily they are all young enough to start families of their own if they choose to and get on with their lives which they are all doing.

I hope their lives are real happy today.  The movie was a good reenactment and I loved Reese Witherspoon.

6308608,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"The soul-crushing truths which impel this narrative give it an undeserved authority.  Ultimately, we should all of us pray that these events are fictional.  But no.  Colin Firth is preposterous, so flagrantly stupid a choice for lead that I smell some manner of nasty metaphysical agenda at play.  Firth is amateurish as a successful Arkansan private investigator.  It seems to be a doomed effort for actors who are not Southern to portray Southerners.  Firth fails with an arrogant relish.  Not once does Firth address another person with ""Please.""  This is contemptible.  Southerners ask, they don't order.  And they ask ""Please.""  Always.  The phoning-in of a quasi British aristocrat with some Southern ""accent"" is painful.  In the words of our own American marvel, Steve Martin, hearing faked Southern speech makes a Southerner feel ""like he's got lunchmeat in his shoes...""  And hearing same deployed by a successful British actor makes it worse, like maybe several layers of olive loaf all down in there

Reese Witherspoon's a pro, an adorable pro.  She always has been, always will be.

There are fine portrayals of Arkansan police officers, crushed by what they see and by what duty requires of them.  Crushed, but mobilized.  Cole Younger once said ""...only a natural fool or an innocent madman would choose to be a criminal...""  The former would do well to view Devil's Knot, get a glimpse at the type of men and women who seek to cage criminals.  Or kill them.  Either option works for me.  The bond common to all police officers is that of the broken-hearted who must go on.

However, we remain human.  Wondrously, clumsily human, just people trying to deal with vile enormities and treacheries beyond us, not of our world.  We drop the ball, lose evidence, get played.  We collapse weeping, armed, wearing a badge.  But we don't quit.  Never will.  In the end, we win.

I should let this one ""thing"" go, but Lordy Lordy, I can't.  I won't!  I'm like the dog that caught the car with this one.  Midway thru, during trial, the silly Mr Firth actually rises, with court in-session, Judge seated, rises and ambles gracefully over to the bailiff's gate while Prosecution and Defense contends at bench with His Honor.  The silly Mr Firth stands there, I guess eavesdropping to get some skinny which might help his bottom line.  Maybe to the nasty idiots who cast him, Firth represents a beacon or Batman there to oversee things.  This conduct is criminal, a misdemeanor, contempt of court.  Yet the bailiff does not act, nor the Judge, to demand of Mr Silly that he immediately sit back down and shut up.  Please.  Excuse me, Southerners never employ ""shut up.""  We prefer ""Please be quiet.""  There's not a Courtroom in this country, properly run, Southern, Northern, Inuit, hillbilly, Tex-Mex, vegan, pick one, where such an act would be unrestrained, just allowed to happen.  Nope.

But, being human, I've just failed, introducing levity where, perhaps, it doesn't belong.  Forgive me, please.

There are the facts, there's this movie.  And there's us, human beings where we are, surrendering to the deadly attractions of evil, fighting back in self-defense if we've got the spittle for it.  And we usually do.  Heroically so.

For me, this movie was most effective, worth its price of admission.  I say this is a movie for those of you who have a heart.  Those of you who don't well, hey, we will all, each and every one, meet our Maker one day.  Now won't we?",1403136000,,3471,4.824531516183987

It's had the most profound affect on me. It feels like it all is unfolding in real time; as if I could drive from CA to AR and help solve the case before such a farce of a police investigation and even more of a farce of a legal situation ensues. Not possible, but...

I think that's why this movie, while really well crafted--which is a rarity these days in Hollywood--went right to video and even there isn't as loved as it could be. I think most of us early watchers are those familiar with the case and I think we want, if not closure, more of a point of view. I envision a film that shows a few of the possibilities as though they did happen, and then an investigator ""rewinding the film"" to poke holes into the the theories. There are no heroes in this movie. It even avoids the topic of Jesse not testifying against Damien and Jason. If we can't have a ""Lovely Bones"" POV that can point with certainty at the guilty, at least give us an ""Alex Cross""-like character who can lead us toward the most likely answers.

I give this 4 stars because I think that it's a great ""first watch"" if you're unfamiliar with this case.

It does, however, provide some fairly interesting reenacted personal perspectives of the various parties: victims' families, the accused ""Memphis 3"" and certain of their friends, the police and prosecution, the defense teams, etc. DEVIL's KNOT makes for a compelling enough show and is expertly filmed with decent but not great acting. Though I'm sure that there are some misrepresentations of certain details, it is faithful to the basic events of this case. The biggest limitation is that those who have read the various books and seen earlier films will not find anything terribly new here while casual viewers who are unfamiliar with the case will find all the various characters and shifting perspectives confusing.

Colin Firth gives a nice performance as private investigator for the defense Ron Lax; ditto for Reese Witherspoon as Pam Hobbs. DEVIL's KNOT might have worked better with a stricter focus on one or maybe both of these characters, even if that meant ignoring certain other people and factors in the case.

Regardless, this film is very revealing of how incompetent police work, selective use of evidence by the prosecution, and public hysteria in this rather superstitious Bible Belt community led to the denial of reasonable doubt for the accused ""Memphis 3."" Without telling you what to think or pointing the finger unduly, it also cursorily examines other potential suspects. There are some brief bits of courtroom drama, but again, the focus changes just as things get really interesting.

In short, DEVIL's KNOT is quite watchable, but the attempt to tell the entire story in a narrative of less than two hours is inadequate and dissatisfying.

Based on Mara Leveritt's book by the same name (which I had read when it was first published - an excellent book, and I highly recommend it), the film focuses on the tragedy of the gruesome murder of three children - and the gross injustice of condemning three innocent young men for crimes they never committed.  The performances by the entire cast are outstanding; Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon are brilliant as investigator Ron Lax and Pamela Hobbs, the grief-stricken mother who comes to realize the wrong men were convicted of the murders.  Mychael Danna's original score is poignant and haunting.

Director Atom Egoyan delivers a very good film, although it's a little too long, and the pace is rather slow.  I was a bit taken aback at the final credits - no mention was made of the fact that a scene from the 1975 20th Century Fox movie ""Race With The Devil"" was incorporated into ""Devil's Knot""; this is when Vicki Hutcheson (portrayed by Mireille Enos) concocts her phony story about meeting Damien Echols for a nighttime outdoor ritual - the ""Race With The Devil"" scene depicts a bonfire ritual in which a young blonde woman is killed.

6308618,3,B00J0IPLBQ,"The West Memphis Three / Robin Hood Hills murder case has received so much media attention over the years that its hard to believe theres anyone who doesnt know about it. In fact, I would normally include spoiler warnings before discussing a recent film in detail; but it hardly seems necessary in this case since there are absolutely no surprises or revelations that are not already well known.

At least two full length books, ""Blood of Innocents"" and ""Devils Knot"" (the book this film is based on) have been devoted to the subject, as well as countless articles, essays and editorials.  There have been three ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries as well as the more recent ""West of Memphis"" covering the case in minute detail  not to mention the television coverage through such programs as ""48 Hours"". Damien Echols has even written extensively in the form of memoirs regarding the case and the time he spent in prison after being found guilty.

Most of what has been written or filmed about this case takes the position that a terrible miscarriage of justice occurred in West Memphis with the conviction of Echols, Baldwin & Misskelley; and that may very well be true. ""Blood of Innocents"", the original book on the subject, is perhaps the only major coverage of this case which defends the police and the prosecution and rightly or wrongly lays out the evidence used to prosecute and convict the three West Memphis teenagers of these murders. The ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries were very well done and attempted to be fair, even though they also leaned heavily toward the defendants when dispensing the benefit of the doubt. I believe that is likely the reasonable thing to do with so much confusing evidence with many points in dispute.

""Devils Knot"", both the book and the film, take the point of view that the police and prosecutors almost intentionally set out to railroad and convict three innocent children of these crimes. While there may have been a great deal of misunderstanding, mishandling and interpretation of evidence and so forth, I doubt the police, district attorney or trial judge knowingly and willingly sent two adolescents to a sentence of life in prison and one other to a death sentence on purpose  and that is the problem I have with ""Devils Knot"", both the book and this film.

""Devils Knot"", the film, features several well-known actors (Reese Witherspoon, Colin Firth and Dane DeHaan and others) in a cast that does a credible job with the material at hand. It is certainly worth watching for students of the case, even though I must confess that I watched it streaming on Netflix  only a few weeks after its release in theaters, which may speak volumes in itself. I own the other books and films on these murders; but I won't be purchasing this one. Its just not that relevant.

All dramatizations of true stories take certain liberties, of course; but ""Devils Knot"", in keeping with its general POV, distorts quite a lot. For instance, although Pam Hobbs has in recent years come to doubt the guilt of the West Memphis Three in favor of suspecting her former husband, she certainly did not begin to do so immediately after the trials. The film also introduces Chris Morton as a major character in the film while he has always been treated as a rather minor blip on the radar in other works on the subject. ""Devils Knot"" makes much ado of Mr Mortons confession during questioning by authorities in California, when it was clearly sarcasm born of frustration after being in police custody for hours. Interestingly enough, the film downplays the confession of Jessie Misskelley. While its true that Mr Misskelleys original confession was problematical due to his intelligence level and mistakes within the confession itself, he continued to confess on several occasions to authorities when he was not even asked to do so. These are just a few examples of inaccuracies which plague this film. Its enjoyable to watch if you know the facts and know what to take with a grain of salt; but just don't depend on this one for the facts. Enough said.

For those who don't know, the West Memphis Three utilized a little known and rarely used legal move known as an Alford Plea to gain their freedom in August of 2011 through an agreement with the prosecutor, who may have doubted that he could get another guilty verdict in case they were granted a new trial. In explanation, an Alford Plea is a guilty plea that affords the right to a continued claim of innocence. This means that Echols, Baldwin and Misskelley remain convicted felons with no right to sue the state of Arkansas for wrongful imprisonment.  However, they are free and Damien Echols no longer has to fear the death penalty. In their position I believe it was a reasonable path for them whether they bear any guilt in this case or not.",1402876800,2,4817,4.791566265060241

6308620,3,B00J0IPLBQ,"The story portrayed in Devil's Knot is the story of the West Memphis 3, a story I am very familiar with. Due to the heinous nature of the crime and the complete incompetence of the local police, the story garnered national attention and has been featured on every news show you can think of. There have also been a ton of documentaries made, all of which I've seen, and all of which call into question who might have really committed these acts. 1993, West Memphis Arkansas, three 8 year old boys go missing in the woods. A huge search party spends 3 days looking for them, before finding them in a popular fishing hole known as the Devil's Knot. There is a big list of suspects, but all the police can see is a group of Satan worshiping teenagers, who have long been a thorn in their sides. Through some very questionable tactics, and a sham of a trial, these teenagers were convicted and sent to prison. From the beginning, there involvement in the crime was called into question, even by the victims families, who saw the injustice of the whole procedure first hand. With my knowledge of the story, I was really interested to see how a film would handle the overwhelming amount of information associated with this case. To my surprise, they didn't do the typical thing and just focus on one aspect of the story, they made the case for the guilt of each of the suspects, and they showed how the police blindly and incompetently when after these three teenagers. As the film goes, they hit the nail right on the head, but when you have all these suspects, and so much back story, squeezed into an hour and a half, it can become extremely confusing for audiences unfamiliar with the case. The film is further harmed by all the interviews and investigation which really slow the pace down. The story of the West Memphis 3 is a tragic one that has led to the freedom of a killer, who did horrible things to three little boys. Devil's Knot is a primary example of police misconduct and the lack of justice available to the less fortunate. If you have an interest, I highly recommend you look into the story and decide for yourself, and a non-bias film covering the events is a great place to start.",1402790400,,2195,4.49

6308622,3,B00J0IPLBQ,"As a longtime supporter of the men who used to be referred to as 'The West Memphis Three,' I literally saw this case unfold. At the time of the murders and the arrests, I was dividing time between a dorm room at ASU in Jonesboro, AR, and my parents' home in Lepanto, AR [both not far from West Memphis]. The instant I saw that three teenagers were arrested for this horrendous crime, I immediately said aloud HELL NO!

Although Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon gave outstanding performances as Ron Lax and Pam Hobbs, the movie depicted events that most hard core supporters have known about for many years. The movie doesn't necessarily point any fingers, however, I would have liked to see the point of view from a different angle. I didn't feel the movie did it as well as the book. Ms. Leveritt's book specifies what her opinion [based on the facts she knew at the time] was regarding suspects. Her book was well written, as was the screenplay. It was gritty, emotionally charged, but seemed to demonize Damien Echols more than the WMPD did in 1993. Yet, at the same time, it focused on Jessie Misskelley's suggestibility, [if one has ever spoken to Jessie, and I have, he or she would spot it in an instant] as well as Jason's shock when the verdict and penalties were announced in court. I was there for the Echols/Baldwin penalty phase hearing, and no one can describe it better than someone who saw it. I never want to see anything like it again, because I was torn due to my belief that Jessie, Damien, and Jason were wrongly convicted, I had extreme sympathy and empathy for the families who lost their children. It was heart wrenching to see the families of the accused treated as if they had committed crimes as well as their sons. It was also difficult to watch the parents of the victims and the accused falling apart. I see it this way: six parents lost children.

Stephen Moyer as John Fogleman was a smart choice. In the extra features, he admitted to speaking to him only once, but he embodied his ire perfectly. Chad Henderson wasn't bad as Brent Davis, but they should have told him Mr. Davis is quite bug eyed and resembled a bull dog at the time. He had more ire in him than any prosecutor I've witnessed, including Fogleman. He was brutal when questioning the defense, and they were far more harsh on Jessie, Damien, and Jason than the movie could touch. I also still cannot believe the buffoonery Paul Ford and Val Price conducted during the trial. They were very lax [pardon the name pun]. The movie captured it well. The ending was fitting, but left me somewhat lost. I assume this was the point. I was touched many times and glad the movie was dedicated to Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers. I don't have many criticisms, as the novel the movie is based on is fantastic, as is the writer, there were a few issues.

First, I do not know who made the choice to shoot in Georgia. I feel it should have been shot in Arkansas, in the towns where it occurred and the trials conducted. I know they had to re-create the pipe bridge and the woods. Georgia? Really? And not ONE shot of the memorial at Weaver Elementary where the boys attended school? Those of us who live in Arkansas know the scenery, the accents, etc., and I am a stickler for details. I really dislike how badly some of the actors had to fake it to an extreme that made it distracting. Arkansas is considered a southern state when it actually is more along the lines of the lower Midwest, especially Northeastern Arkansas. Accents vary. Here, a lot of people overdo it on purpose to feel more 'southern.' Firth, Deehan, and Witherspoon did well. The vernacular was slightly off, as was the outside shots. Nothing looked familiar and I don't like what seemed to be disingenuous [I know it wasn't]. This may be a moot point for most. Unfortunately, it isn't for me.

Secondly, I think most of the key points during the trials were missed. For example, at the death penalty sentence for Damien, they missed his reaction, how he was dressed, and the hoards of Wiccans standing outside in support. When it was announced Echols and Baldwin were being tried in Craighead County, there was a store on Nettleton Avenue in Jonesboro that provided goods and services for the pagans in the community. No one cared about the business operation until they discovered the trial for Echols and Baldwin would take place in 'this God-fearing small scale city.' After all, there are so many churches here that there is actually a street called Church. Every block on Church Street has a church. Some Arkansans are very intolerant of people who are different. VERY. Before the trial began, there was a march downtown by the court house to chase the pagan store owners out of town. It worked. They closed up shop. For good. There was and has been a Satanic Panic in Northeast Arkansas as far back as I can remember. It began heavily in the 1980s. The movie depicted it as something minor, when in fact, people are actually rabid about it. Especially local churches. Nowadays, it's not Satan responsible, it's drugs. There was pressure to find the culprits and I feel the WMPD had been pushed to focus all their energy on Echols, Baldwin, and Misskelley with made up stories instead of investigating some possible real leads. Yes, I'm going to say it. The Big Red Herring: Mr. Bojangles Man. An officer supposedly 'lost' blood samples taken from Bojangles. How convenient. Need not have evidence that could have been useful.

Thirdly, I know the focus seemed to be on Pam Hobbs and Ron Lax. That was well and good. However, there were other sets of parents who lost children. No one focused on the Byers' or the Moores. No one focused on the parents of the accused, only depicting Damien's sister, and his girlfriend at the time. I respect Ms. Hobbs [whom I believe has gone back to her maiden name] more than she could ever imagine, but this case shattered Jason's mother and other family members. I'm sure Damien's and Jessie's folks were the same. Despite any differences we have with our parents, it is usually them we turn to when we are in trouble. No matter what they have done to us, we want our mothers or fathers in times of stress. .

In all, this movie was very well done while still missing what I've mentioned and the supporter movement that began a few years later. I felt quite alone for a while. I'm glad I wasn't. There was simply not enough time to show everything. The movie would have been a mini-series. This, along with the documentaries made, would give a new person a glimpse of the case. Yet, there is an unbelievable amount of information lurking out there that should be examined. I never thought Jessie, Jason, or Damien were guilty, and I'm not trying to sway anyone's opinion or suggesting suspects. I know who didn't do it. Let's put it that way. Research, read, watch, whatever, and make up your own mind. Mara Leveritt has put her heart and soul into this case, as well as many others. The men are free, but have lost a good chunk of their lives. They all seem to be moving on and that is all anyone who supports them can wish. As for the victims, they will never have true justice or peace until the real culprit is caught and Jessie, Jason, and Damien exonerated.

I have not and will never forget the victims, their parents, or the three men themselves. People often believe that supporters do not have any feelings whatsoever about Stevie, Christopher, or Michael. Those who assume such are wrong. I remember them every year when May 5 arrives. I know others who always do as well. I simply hope one day that Ms. Hicks, Mr. Byers, and the Moores can find closure. I hope exoneration will eventually be possible if the right person(s) come forward.",1402444800,45,7768,4.580158159597412

6308624,4,B00J0IPLBQ,"First off, I never gave much thought to the controversy surrounding the West Memphis Three. I was always around bands who protested their sentencing and read about the objections to their trials, but never gave it any more thought than that. I never watched or reviewed any of the ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries so I didn't feel like I had the right to take a side on the subject. All I knew was three little boys were murdered and it was a horrible tragedy.

In 1993, three young boys go into the woods of a small town in West Memphis, Arkansas. After their bodies are found in the river, the entire region is turned upside down as the murderer is tracked down. Three teenage locals accused of being Satanists are suspects in the killings. Have the authorities found the killers or is there more to the story that we've never heard?

When I saw a movie was being made based on the murders at Robin Hood Hill in West Memphis, Arkansas, I didn't even entertain seeing it. Not that I'm an unfeeling human being. I just try to put my focus on certain types of films and stick within those parameters because of time constraints. My mind was changed when I found out Scott Derrickson co-wrote and executive produced ""Devil's Knot.""

Scott Derrickson is a Hollywood director who shares many of the same Christian beliefs I do. It just so happens he wrote and directed what is in my opinion one of the finest examples of a supernatural horror film in 2013 - ""Sinister."" He also directed ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake, ""Hellraiser: Inferno,"" and the upcoming ""Deliver Us from Evil."" Recently, Derrickson announced he's attached to helm the upcoming ""Doctor Strange"" movie for Marvel and Disney. Needless to say, I have a deep respect for his work and anything he puts his name on.

Director Atom Egoyan's ""Devil's Knot"" isn't meant to break any new ground in the investigations of the West Memphis killings. I see it as a tool to expose and tell the story to new people who might not be interested in watching documentaries or reading pages of case studies. It's an easy way to get people educated about one of the most infamous murder trials in American history.

""Devil's Knot"" encouraged me to do some research on the killings. As soon as the credits rolled onscreen, I hit the internet and compared what I'd seen to the actual evidence and professional conjecture I found. It's safe to say Egoyan's movie doesn't embellish much and sticks to the facts.

I was very impressed by the cast assembled for the indie film. ""Devil's Knot"" boasts Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth as the two lead characters. Supporting actors include Stephen Moyer, Bruce Greenwood, Elias Koteas, and Alessandro Nivola. It's obvious they all took the movie seriously and put their heart and souls into their performance.

""Devil's Knot"" was never rated for the U.S. and contains disturbing images, language, and nudity. The crime scene photographs and sequences were enough to make me cringe and look away at points and I'm a horror film fanatic. It's just something about knowing this was based on true events that made me uneasy watching those scenes. The only nudity is of the bodies of the three murder victims. Trust me, there's nothing gratifying or attractive in what we are shown. It's purely used to display the severity of the perverse and sick nature of the crimes.

A few extra features are included for the DVD version of ""Devil's Knot."" Two featurettes delve into ""The Making of 'Devil's Knot'"" and ""Getting into Character: The Cast of 'Devil's Knot.'"" It also contains deleted scenes from the film.

If you're uneducated on the events surrounding the murders at Robin Hood Hill in West Memphis, Arkansas, I highly recommend you seeing ""Devil's Knot."" If you've seen all the ""Paradise Lost"" documentaries, chances are you'll feel like you're seeing a basic retread of the information already shared in those films. According to my research, it seems to be the perfect opportunity to get educated about the tragic murders and the three boys accused of the crimes.",1402012800,,4101,4.7974504249291785

6308628,2,B00J0IPLBQ,"The story of the West Memphis Three has garnered a ton of media attention over the last two decades, and for good reason. It's a classic mix of elements that attract news outlets like bees to honey: murder, satanic cults, corruption, miscarriages of justice, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Since the murdered bodies of three young boys were discovered in an Alabama creek twenty years ago, the case has become a ""cause celebre"" due to the apparent false imprisonment of accused murderers Damien Echols, Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin, seemingly railroaded by a system and town swept up in hysterics. The story was chronicled fully in three incredible Paradise Lost documentaries and the Peter Jackson-produced West of Memphis, leaving little room for Atom Egoyan's narrative feature Devil's Knot to forge its own path.

Given the wealth of material already out there about the West Memphis Three case, Egoyan's decision to take on a dramatic interpretation of events is a mystery. It's a no-win scenario if there ever was one. Get it right and people will say the film basically wrote itself; get it wrong and you get Devil's Knot, which is flimsy, unnecessary, and manages to turn a compelling true story into something dull.

There doesn't seem to be much that co-writers Scott Derrickson (of Sinister fame) and Paul Boardman have done other than take what we already know and get A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Colin Firth to reenact it. Witherspoon takes on the role of Pam Hobbs, who one normal day in 1993 allows her son Steve to go out and play with his friends, warning him to be back in time for her to get to work. But when the boy doesn't show up, it begins a firestorm of rage and accusations that consume this small, devout Southern town. Not that you really get a sense of all that as the film focuses mainly on Hobbs and Colin Firth as southern investigator Ron Lax, who Damien Echols described as a bit player in the whole ordeal. Actually, Echols has been pretty open in his disdain for the movie and it's pretty easy to see why. In overly sentimental, movie-of-the-week fashion it skips over crucial details in the case; particularly troubling when one thinks how a lack of attention to detail is largely what doomed Echols, Jessie Misskelley, and Jason Baldwin to serve years behind bars for a crime they likely didn't commit.

And so what we get is a thumbnail version of events and the players involved. Firth's Lax is particularly underserved, and the actor struggles to find anything to do with him. If he's truly ""obsessed"" over the case and making sure the accused go free, then why don't we ever see that passion? Instead we get characters, including the usually-amazing Amy Ryan as his ex-wife, talking at us about it. We get such an idealized, perfectly home-spun version of Hobbs that Witherspoon is left with nothing to do but be sad. There's a lot more to Hobbs' part of this story than this film is willing to portray, and the same goes for her skeevy husband Terry Hobbs (Alessandro Nivola), who in reality DNA evidence fingers as being involved in the murders. But the film tip-toes around that issue and in anything that steers too far away from a narrow and incomplete narrative that only encompass a small piece of a much larger canvas. Dane DeHaan is sorely wasted as a key witness, joined by other top actors who flit in and out without leaving much impact; Mireille Enos, Kevin Durand, Stephen Moyer, and Bruce Greenwood among others. Each of their characters is as thinly drawn as the dubious circumstances surrounding the police investigation, which was driven by religious zealotry, political gamesmanship, and flat-out ignorance.

There just doesn't seem to be much of a reason for this film to exist. It literally says nothing new and what it does say is poorly executed. The film ends with a lousy update that tells us everything that happened with the case over the years, but it only serves to highlight how unfinished Devil's Knot truly is. If someone is looking for a better, far more compelling walkthrough of the unbelievable West Memphis Three story, either hit Wikipedia or rent one of the documentaries instead.",1400976000,35,4190,4.807212205270457

First of all, a movie of this length does not do any justice to the case itself. I felt like I was watching a very poor dramatization of the Paradise Lost movies. Though Pamela Hobbs has now supported the West Memphis 3, originally she did not seem to have any doubt that they were guilty. It makes for a somewhat good story but not convincing in this case.

Second, there was truly no additional dialogue or nod to any information other than the Paradise Lost movies... with the exception of some of the Ron Lax additions.

Third, i can see why Damien was angry about this. i can only imagine what the original script was. Sure, he was a messed up kid but, hell, who wasn't at that age? There were a lot of us emo goth kids. The movie did nothing but cast a shadow of guilt on him which, after all these years, is what he has been trying to get away from.

Last, I can enjoy a good movie based on a book but this movie was not entertaining. It was flat, dull and simply did not even make you feel the anger or sympathy that any of the documentaries did. And with a movie like this, there is really a lot of material to increase the drama.

Overall, I cannot recommend this at all. Read Devil's Knot, watch the Paradise Lost trilogy and West of Memphis. These men and those poor little boys deserved better than this Hollywood trash.",1400544000,23,1492,4.2027972027972025

Ron Lax (Colin Firth) a rich private investigator, a major player whose background we never know, offers to assist the defense. There were a number of issues raised during the trial and investigation that makes you wonder how this went to trial in the first place, except for the fact the town was filled with belief that Satanists are everywhere out to harm them.

It is a decent crime drama. Reese Witherspoon was allowed to let loose  her accent and had a few good moments. It also had scenes with her that seemed wasted and went nowhere as she raised doubt too little too late. Colin Firth, a fine actor, seemed miscast. His face was emotionless for most of the film.

These confessions, taken as a whole, suggest he and the other two were very much involved in these murders.  The movie makes a lot of hay about the inconsistencies in Jessie's confessions and some of the mistakes he made about the details. Well, he also stated he was drunk on hard liquor at the time, and this could effect not only his judgment during the murders but his recollection of them days and weeks and months later. It kind of reminds me of the Casey Anthony case.  Yeah, we all know she was involved, but there still wasn't enough evidence to convict.  Such is life on this crazy planet of ours.  The only thing I know, those murdered boys now rest in peace, something their killers will never experience.",1522540800,,1311,4.6943231441048034
