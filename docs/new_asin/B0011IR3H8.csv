3065642,4,B0011IR3H8,"I'd watch Dominique Pinon in just about anything.  He's the unlikeliest of movie stars...poles apart from any perceived ""ideal"" of a leading man.  Yet, he's unendingly watchable on screen.

That appeal is used to fine effect by director Claude Lelouch in 'Roman De Gare.'  There's a moment where the movie could go one way or another.  Pinon's character either is who he says he is...or he's someone else entirely.  And that someone else would be a dangerous thing indeed for Audrey Dana's Huguette, who Pinon catches at her absolute nadir.  It would be giving away the thrill of the movie to let you know how that encounter turns out, but Lelouch plays up that moment for all that it's worth.  It's a brilliant piece of directing.

'Roman De Gare' means a trashy, airport novel, the type Judith Ralitzer (Fanny Ardant) writes.  Or is Ralitzer who writes them at all?  'Roman De Gare' applies to the movie that Lelouch is making as well.  So, expect some slightly incredulous twists and turns in the plot.  It's all great fun.

Audrey Dana was the revelation here for me.  At first I thought: nothing special.  But her beauty is the type that creeps up on you, and her acting talent is undeniable.  The scene where she chases away her soon-to-be-ex from the family farm is an instant classic.  Hands down the best scene in this enjoyable film.",1299715200,6,1343,4.690987124463519

First at all it's a personal gaze to the Noir Film but retouched with the majestic elegance and joir de vivre so typical from the Fifties, in which the golden names of Jules Dassin (Rififi), Rene Clement (Purle noon), Claude Chabrol (This man must die) come to our mind. But, let's say it at once : it's a deserved homage in Hitchcok's memory.

On the other hand, the film is also a tribute to Dumas, Balzac, Roman Gary, Hemingway, Highsmith and the literature in its braod sense.

Lelouch did without of a great budget to build a solid script without special effects or inneccesary bloody scenes to create the atmosphere and the tension around a sinister lady who has known to cheat the entire world.

The true behind stages is a humble but clever journalist who is the real author of a group of widely knwon bestsellers. Since that non so ehtical perspective, the film begins to show the fame in many cases is not linked with the talent but with how to get ""the coup de grace"".

A bit strange that Huguette's often expressed negative self esteem was mostly not supported by the appearance of the actress chosen to play her.  Also strange that a control freak medifraud would even consider ""marrying"" a chain smoker who merely consulted him about how to quit involvement in that favorite extortion scheme of the pushers of All Co Hell, Marriage You Wanna, and object rape con dumbs.

You keep hearing of this sex offender who has broken out of prison throughout the early part of the movie. Then of course some weird creepy guy shows up at the gas station and pretty much s talks the girl who was left behind. He pretty much forces his help on her. She reluctantly agrees. They drive on downt he road together. One thing leads to another. She ropes him into pretending to be her bf as her family has not seen him. So is he a creep? Isn't he? That is just one of the many questions you are presented with. But it is not really the epicenter of the movie. It is mildly entertaining to me. No real wow moment. If the guy had been anyone other than that gummy looking dude that played the lead character . . . I might have been more interested. Just being honest. But in the end none of these people are people I would befriend or want in my life. They are all immoral and Godless.

3065825,5,B0011IR3H8,"Directed and written by Claude LeLouch and first released in 2006, ""Roman de Gare"" is a well-paced, suspenseful thriller.  The film is intelligently written, well-acted and beautifully produced -- all on a budget.  The film is in French with clear and accurate subtitles.

The movie demands the viewer's full concentration -- not an overly-demanding task because it holds the attention throughout  Still an advantage of seeing the film in DVD is that it allows for repeated viewings so that the tangled plot my be followed.  The story features a successful French woman author of popular novels whose most recent effort is titled ""God, the Other"".  Her previous and less critically acclaimed novel had the title of the movie, ""Roman de Gare"" or ""Crossed Tracks"" which aptly sums up the events of the film.

The crossed tracks in the film are those of the alleged author, her ghostwriter, an escaped serial killer/rapist, a doctor who leaves his wife and family, and a young attractive lonely woman who claims to be a hairdresser while working as a prostitute.  The film builds its suspense by teasing the audience about who is who .  Scenes alternate abruptly but logically among various groups of characters. The ghostwriter, effectively portrayed by Domique Pinon, is at the center of the film.  With his scruffy unshaven face and shabby clothes he appears to be the killer.  Then, LeLouch  shows him as the apparent victim of the celebrated author who has retained his services for seven years.  The story comes clear at the end in a surprising but convincing fashion.  The tension, story line, and scenery from Paris to rural France, to the highway are beautifully done. There is more than a hint of satire in this film about the writing life.

This movie is a find and will delight viewers who enjoy thrillers, film noir, or artistically-made foreign film.  It has recently been reissued on DVD and distributed by First Run Features, which kindly sent me a review copy.

Call me a traditionalist, but it was refreshing to watch an intelligent movie, one that does not rely upon special effects and gigantic Hollywood budgets.

A bit strange that Huguette's often expressed negative self esteem was mostly not supported by the appearance of the actress chosen to play her.  Also strange that a control freak medifraud would even consider ""marrying"" a chain smoker who merely consulted him about how to quit involvement in that favorite extortion scheme of the pushers of All Co Hell, Marriage You Wanna, and object rape con dumbs.

They drive on downt he road together. One thing leads to another. She ropes him into pretending to be her bf as her family has not seen him. So is he a creep? Isn't he? That is just one of the many questions you are presented with. But it is not really the epicenter of the movie. It is mildly entertaining to me. No real wow moment. If the guy had been anyone other than that gummy looking dude that played the lead character . . . I might have been more interested. Just being honest.

3300322,5,B0011IR3H8,"Directed and written by Claude LeLouch and first released in 2006, ""Roman de Gare"" is a well-paced, suspenseful thriller.  The film is intelligently written, well-acted and beautifully produced -- all on a budget.  The film is in French with clear and accurate subtitles.

The movie demands the viewer's full concentration -- not an overly-demanding task because it holds the attention throughout  Still an advantage of seeing the film in DVD is that it allows for repeated viewings so that the tangled plot my be followed.  The story features a successful French woman author of popular novels whose most recent effort is titled ""God, the Other"".  Her previous and less critically acclaimed novel had the title of the movie, ""Roman de Gare"" or ""Crossed Tracks"" which aptly sums up the events of the film.

The crossed tracks in the film are those of the alleged author, her ghostwriter, an escaped serial killer/rapist, a doctor who leaves his wife and family, and a young attractive lonely woman who claims to be a hairdresser while working as a prostitute.  The film builds its suspense by teasing the audience about who is who .  Scenes alternate abruptly but logically among various groups of characters. The ghostwriter, effectively portrayed by Domique Pinon, is at the center of the film.  With his scruffy unshaven face and shabby clothes he appears to be the killer.  Then, LeLouch  shows him as the apparent victim of the celebrated author who has retained his services for seven years.  The story comes clear at the end in a surprising but convincing fashion.  The tension, story line, and scenery from Paris to rural France, to the highway are beautifully done. There is more than a hint of satire in this film about the writing life.

This movie is a find and will delight viewers who enjoy thrillers, film noir, or artistically-made foreign film.  It has recently been reissued on DVD and distributed by First Run Features, which kindly sent me a review copy.

It's based on the typical Shakespearean device of mistaken identities, and other people most deliberately pretending to be those they are not (yes, there is a kind of wedding in the middle, al Shakespeare, with a substitute bridegroom) -- and what makes it interesting is that you never really figure out who is what.  How many concealed identities are there?  Is Huguette really a hooker or a hairdresser, or a little of both?  What did her daughter talk about when she was fishing with the phony bridegroom?  Was she telling him her mom's previous romantic adventures?

And then there's the city/country/city theme.  How did the people from metropolitan France end up in the beyond, well beyond and behind the provincial?  The appalachia of France?

And talk about concealment . . . Ralitzer herself is concealing that she . . .wrote nothing.
