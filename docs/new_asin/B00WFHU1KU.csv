Movie",1445731200,,11,5.0
7131729,3,B00WFHU1KU,"This is a decent movie and the solid ratings are pretty justified. It's not really a horror film, more of a drama thriller. The acting a good/above average for a lower-budget movie. (Not even sure why one reviewer said the acting was bad. Go watch 90% of micro-budget movies. You'll see what bad acting really is.) The lead was very good and should find steady work after this. My biggest complaint was the lighting was awful at times. Instead of using lights to simulate sunlight, they just shot inside an actual house with real sunlight shining through the windows. That looks awful on camera.

For a rental, I'd probably pass. For free on Amazon Prime, I'd recommend. Easily better than a large percentage of micro-budget movies.",1443484800,,732,4.809523809523809
7131730,5,B00WFHU1KU,"Fresh take on the psycho roommate genre. I love this movie making family. They take themselves way to seriously in Toronto. This movie is unintentionally absurdly hilarious. Watch out for the evil bitch with the shellfish allergy trick and you couldn't see the poke a hole in the condom gag from 20 miles away. And don't install chandeliers when clever cuckoo bird Tracy is around. I would love to know how many loonies were needed to produce this magic camp extravaganza. WARNING: watch out for women who's legs are stuck together cause they're loony as Canadian cash. Plus, enjoy the worst/best montage of all time. At least these guys had the brains to keep this glorious film at an hour and a half. Canada cares! Oh yeah and also watch out for rubber knives. Pretty gnarly ending and great credits. I can't stop laughing. I will never forget you Clean Break.",1443225600,,862,4.71523178807947
7131731,4,B00WFHU1KU,"Fun low budget Drama/Slasher flick. Mentally unstable woman kills a bunch of people and that's pretty much it. At times felt like a play since there aren't many locations (almost all of it takes place at a house), but I still liked it.

Spoiler: If the most unlikeable character (a womanizer) would've gotten killed instead of the nice guy, I'd rate it 5 stars.",1442188800,,361,4.640625
7131732,1,B00WFHU1KU,I was tricked because it said IMDB rating 7? Not even watchable. Enjoy my 3 bucks tricksters......,1437696000,,98,4.823529411764706
