198737,5,1583500251,"I owned this video years ago until I loaned it to a friend.  I have been trying to find it on DVS but to no avail.  This film was very enlightening and pretty much confirmed what I already believed.  What prehistoric people called the Goddess is not important to me.  Many believe she was called Earth Mother and that name is as good as any other for me.  The important point is this:  from the stand point of pure reason, if there is an all powerful being that created life, this being would have to be a woman.  But let's look at it from a different level.  The idea that woman can come from one of man's ribs in my opinion leaves a lot of questions to be answered.  On the other hand to say we (the human race) came from woman makes sense.  Mother earth supplies us with all we need to survive, yet we taken natural resources that belong to all of us, synthesized them, and sell us what we already own for high profit.  Women give birth and at one time they were revered for this life giving act.  When my wife and I had our son, we had a midwife.  We chose a midwife because we didn't want to have our baby delivered, my wife delivered the baby and the midwife caught the baby.  This film is a must see for anyone interested in a different take on spirituality than the outdated, modern, and commercialized spirituality of today.  Spirituality is free to everyone who wants it and no one has a monopoly on God.",1148256000,8,1414,4.223880597014926
198738,1,1583500251,"The plausibility level of this beautifully produced video is revealed by one of its earliest statement: (roughly) ""For thirty thousand years a goddess was worshipped, who was universally known as 'The Great Mother'.""  How can it be known what people called anything, thirty thousand years before the invention of writing?  I have no argument with spirituality or the benefits people derive from it, but the ""Goddess Movement,"" as typified by this video, relies on guesses and assumptions that are not borne out by any real data that we have about prehistory.  This is not, to my mind, a good basis for anyone's spirituality.  Richard S. Ellis, Professor of Near Eastern Archeology, Bryn Mawr College.",1049241600,9,700,5.114035087719298
198739,5,1583500251,"Here is Dr. Gimbutas talking to a small group of students and the professor in an informal, intimate setting.  The format is standard:  first an exposition of the topic of the Old World goddess cultures, and second a question and answer period, not overtaxing as only several pertinent questions are asked, and the answers are just as pertinent and interesting.
Dr. Gimbutas has a passion for her life's work which is communicated to the viewer of this video; many of the figurines which she displays were excavated by herself in Macedonia, Crete, etc.  She begins with the water bird goddess, prevelant for several millennia throughout Europe.  The snake goddess, and even the head and horns of a bull, are further feminine examples.  Universally, before invaders destroyed this sweet civilization in three separate phases, the earth was peaceful.  The only weapons were for hunting.  There were no fortifications, ramparts, no one claimed dominion over the sky (what we now call ""air space"").  She suggests we cannot go back, but take what is known, incorporate it, and move forward with it.  After September 11th, one wonders if it is not too late.  Still, it's worth a try.
If you're interested in the goddess, as well as viewing an exceptional woman and teacher, you'll enjoy this video.  It's one I plan to watch again as I think you can learn more from it every time.",1011052800,18,1374,4.879310344827586
198740,5,1583500251,This video offers a touching look at the Goddess as She has been worshipped since ancient times into the present.  It is a must see for anyone who wants to know what Goddess worship is about from an objective  perspective.  Perhaps one of the best parts of this video is that some of  the great teachers in modern Paganism are interviewed (ex: Starhawk).,954115200,21,354,4.571428571428571
198741,4,1583500251,"The Goddess, 1958 film

It begins in a rural area (dirt road) in 1930 Maryland. A woman and a young girl get off a bus. She has a room with relatives. They talk about the death of her husband. [The talk reminds us of a stage play.] Lorraine is emotional, her talk tells her history. She wants to leave her daughter with relatives! I don't rightly think it is! The child heard it all. This child is lonely; she gives milk to her cat. I got promoted today. Years later she is a teenager. Emily Ann attracts attention. What did they say about me? She goes out with a doctors son. Her talk tells about her outlook on life. Lewis stops the car. Id like to see you again she says.

Its a rainy day. John Tower is found drunk on the sidewalk and taken to a hotel room. [No sheets on that bed?] Tower sleeps off his drunkenness and finds Emily in his room. He sounds suicidal. What are you living for? Johns talk tells about his past. His older brother is in an asylum. Emily spends time with John. They talk, then they marry. There is tension in the marriage. John is transferred to a combat outfit, Emmy has a baby that cries. She is unhappy with the choices she made in her life. [Like her mother?] Emmy arrives in 1947 Hollywood, age 21. She is with a boxer from St. Louis. Dutch wants to go back and get into the contracting business. Well be so happy. Do you love me? Emmy is insecure. They see a movie. They have twin beds. Their lives are empty and lonely.

Emmy visits a Hollywood producer, they want to put her under contract. She must first visit the producer at his home that night. We hear about her nervous breakdown. Emmy is a star now. Her mother lives with her now. Its 1957, boys play in the street (as was common then). Her mother died, there is a funeral. Emmy drinks. John Tower attends with his daughter. Emmy shows her grief. [Its not only the loss of a loved one but a prediction of your future.] Can her daughter see Emmy? Emmy is unhappy, always, with her life. Even though she is famous. She has no one to love. She will never respond to treatment said a psychiatrist. [Proper diagnosis and treatment?] Emma will return to Hollywood and make pictures until its over.

This story is said to be based on the life of a movie star famous in the 1950s. She was found dead of a sleeping pill overdose in 1962. Some say she was murdered because of her relationships with more famous and powerful men. If this story reflects reality why would anyone want to be a movie star? The shadows on a screen are not reality, the characters shown are only actors paid to perform. Some of them retain their character and present it on screen, like the early movies of Marion Morrison (better known by his screen name). The French (?) have a saying the worst fate for a poor girl is to be born beautiful as it leads to exploitation in a wicked world. Do you agree?",1429488000,2,2863,4.2865064695009245

198743,4,1583500251,"My redundant contribution is that this is a great performance by Kim Stanley. Moreover, the uncompromising script and treatment cement Goddess's status as a mildly subversive, certainly offbeat, cult classic. If I have any problem with the film it's in the sometimes bizarre casting, including Lloyd Bridges in a one-note performance as Stanley's lunkhead husband and Werner Klemperer as a smarmy producer. Even more so Betty Lou Holland as Stanley's mother. She looks more like Stanley's younger sister and a check confirms Holland was actually one year younger than Stanley when the film was made. Nonetheless, a solid four stars.",1420416000,,632,5.33

198746,5,1583500251,"It was because of Kim Stanley's performance in ""The Goddess"" that I
wrote the biography -""Mad As Hell - The Life and Work of Paddy
Chayefsky,"" in which the genesis and production of the film is
discussed by those who were closely involved. The leading role was
not only based on Marilyn Monroe, Paddy sent her the script, and she
wanted to do the film. Before her husband, Arthur Miller, changed her
mind and threatened to sue if it was made. Paddy, as co-producer,
proceeded as planned.  Piper Laurie auditioned and was considered
for the role, but Chayefsky wanted Kim Stanley. Both she and he brought
their own rather large degree of control and genius to the production,
which its unique co-stars, Betty Lou Holland and Steve Hill. shared with
me, along with theproducer Milton Perlman and a few of the key others.
During the editing, Paddy, by studio pressure, cut a large chunk of
Stanley's performance. But what remained was by far the most explosive
and shattering portrayal ever seen on the silver screen. The script, a
cover feature in ""Esquire"" magazine, was nominated for an Academy
Award. Kim Stanley wasn't, mainly because she refused to publicize
the film. Nonetheless, it became a cult classic. especially with other
actresses, who are still amazed by the emotional force and visceral
impact of her performance. Columbia Pictures are to be commended
for releasing it on DVD.

The script is heavy-handed(one could actually be injured by it).  It had been rumored to be the life of Marilyn Monroe, but that doesn't help.  It's hard getting through it.  Stanley looks forty and plays seventeen--opposite actors almost seventeen.  Not a wise move.  This is strictly for the strong who want an example of Stanley's work; she was a terrific actress, and we're lucky to have this.  You should see it, at least once.

If you have any illusions about being an actor then this is the movie to watch over and over as a lesson in truth and depth. Stanley burns up the screen scene after scene, and while Chavefsky overwrites wildly Stanley chews it all up and spits it out in a way that will make your hair curl. I saw this as a kid in a movie theatre and have never gotten over the scene at her mother's grave. This is acting that's practically sacrificial and in fact Stanley became a hopeless alcoholic because her emotions were so raw and real in each performance she gave, and she just couldn't live with it. I remember hearing a story about her stage performance in a play about Freud's hysterical patient Anna O. At the finale of the play Anna breaks into hysterical screams as the curtain goes down and Stanley was so convincing that there was dead silence at the curtain. No applause, just silence. She was that great. And this movie shows her at her hair raising best. It's historic stuff, unmatched by anything else out there. There's a good reason she's called the Female Brando, the title of a biography published a couple of years ago.",1336176000,19,1248,4.502202643171806

This is probably a good fifty plus minute watch if you're new to the subject but there'd really nothing new offered here for those already familiar with the Goddess. The script is also a little weak and somewhat repetitive dispite the efforts of narrator Leonard Nimoy to keep the viewer interested.

I was also somewhat annoyed by the constant references to Pele's curse, yet what exactly that curse consists of is never explained. It's OK but could've been so much better.
