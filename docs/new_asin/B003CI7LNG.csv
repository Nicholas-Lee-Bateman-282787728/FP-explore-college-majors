8394240,5,B003CI7LNG,"I was completely blown away by this film - learning after seeing it that what I supposed to be historical footage was all recreated in great detail by the film makers.  They did a remarkable job with it... I felt like I was following Edward and Charis around the dunes of Oceano and the rocky shores of Point Lobos.  It was also a revealing look into the intricate relationship of one of the most creative and dynamic duos in the history of photography, and into the unique and passionate mind of Edward Weston.  Highly Recommended.",1375056000,2,532,4.578947368421052
8394241,4,B003CI7LNG,"Very well researched, filmed and told story. For anybody interested in the history of photography, this is a must see film. It was a very important time in the history of photography. It's a true and poignant story of the love of Edward Weston and his lover, muse, Charis.

  I highly recommend it.
