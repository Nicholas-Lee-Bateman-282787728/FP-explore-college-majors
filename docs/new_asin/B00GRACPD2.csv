8626360,2,B00GRACPD2,"The level of detail for the puppy/beginning work is not good. Very basic explanation with a quick demonstration done by a dog that already knows the concept. The camera angles were also very annoying and cheesy. The camera would be pointed at the guy's face, then it would switch to a side view of the guys face in black and white, then back to direct angle again. I recommend Bill Hillmann's DVDs for everything from puppy to advance retriever work. The camera work is also professional and not distracting.",1520035200,,508,4.719101123595506
