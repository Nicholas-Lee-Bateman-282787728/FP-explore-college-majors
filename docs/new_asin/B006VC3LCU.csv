5020394,1,B006VC3LCU,This was the worse stand up ever. I only laughed one time during the whole dvd. If you watch it long enough you can see the audience trying to struggle to laugh at his boring performance. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME NOR MONEY ON THIS.,1406073600,,229,4.111111111111111

5020396,1,B006VC3LCU,"I can enjoy a bawdy comedian.  He goes a bit beyond bawdy and I think I might not have even cared if his material had just been funny.
Sadly, he has no real material of substance.

  Through out the performance my friends and I really hoped it was going to pick up momentum as well as finally inject some clever and original humor.
  It  never happened.

 I have seen a lot of comedy live and on video/tv/internet and this guy has to be one of the worse *so called comedians*.

I can only hope this was not one of his better performances.",1400371200,,538,4.186274509803922
5020397,1,B006VC3LCU,"I heard a clip of Smoove on the XM radio, comedy central channel. It cracked me up! When I got home for the night I searched on all my streaming video apps, and Amazon was the only one that had a full special of his stand up act. It was nothing like what I heard on the radio. Tired jokes about sex, and other things that just weren't appealing or funny. I chuckled a couple of times, but turned it off about two-thirds of the way through. I wish I could have heard more of the smoove act I heard on the radio...",1397606400,,512,3.9805825242718447
5020398,4,B006VC3LCU,"JB Smoove's energy, fresh material and overall presence during his stand-up comedy act is an undeniable force. His love for his work comes through and is infectious. One of the best comics in the industry today!",1364428800,2,211,4.888888888888889
5020399,5,B006VC3LCU,"I'm older... Jay Lenno show's too puerile for me. After watching this DVD I told my 31 yr old son to watch with his friends, to intrigue them with: ""You aren't ready for this."" Holy crap! Don't have to do crunches for awhile.",1354406400,,225,4.255813953488372
5020400,2,B006VC3LCU,This one just doesn't do it for me. Not a fan of JB Smoove. Maybe I just don't get his comedy.,1351728000,,94,3.5238095238095237
5020401,5,B006VC3LCU,"Very funny!  Lot's of new material.  Creative and imaginative story telling, puts you right in the middle of each situation to the point where you can actually see what JB's talking about.  Couldn't breathe from laughing so hard!",1337644800,4,229,4.973684210526316
5020402,4,B006VC3LCU,I have always been a fan. The theatrics that he performs while on stage really make the standup side splitting. Too funny.,1337558400,2,122,4.590909090909091

5020407,1,B006VC3LCU,"I was very disappointed with this video. I enjoy JB in supporting roles on some sitcoms I've seen him in. When I saw this video was available I thought, well maybe his standup routine is good too. Boy, was I ever wrong. I could't even finish watching it to be honest.
Save your money....this one's a stinker.",1429401600,,308,4.421052631578948
