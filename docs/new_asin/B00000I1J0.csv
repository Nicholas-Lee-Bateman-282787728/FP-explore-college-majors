C+C delivers cool beats,clips,interviews and nice clever  messages like ""education can help us improve our society,set people  free from ignorance,prejudice,reduce violence,AIDS,etc"".You'll find  three gorgeous famous clips,which received awards(GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT,HERE  WE GO LET'S ...,THINGS THAT MAKE YOU GO HMMM...) and 4 live performances in  Tokyo,Japan(A GROOVE OF LOVE,JUST A TOUCH OF LOVE,OOOH BABY ! and GONNA  MAKE YOU SWEAT).Boy! The clips are still awesome ( they 're about 10 years  old!) and the live performances do  blow me away. Every music  lover,especially dance music lovers should watch this. Cole is now dead(what  a pity!),but the spirit of C+C will be found throughout this video. C+C is  now called Robi Rob ( Clivill&eacute;s),who said in one of his notes (available in  two album sleeves )that he'd trade eveything he has to bring Cole back. He  is sorely missed. Dance music lost a great DJ,keyboardist,producer,vocalist  and creator. This video sure is a fine tribute,although SONY should release  a more complete VIDEOGRAPHY.Anyway, it's a MUST-SEE,MUST-LISTEN,and  undoubtedly a MUST-DANCE TO.",964656000,4,1212,5.505434782608695
