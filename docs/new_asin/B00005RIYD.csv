1655703,5,B00005RIYD,"I saw this film at the NoDance Film Festival and I would have to say that I not only laughed myself silly, but was intrigued with these people (or Starwoids, as the movie calls them) from beginning until end. The film takes almost a Utopian approach on how two groups not only stand in line for six weeks for a movie, but also how they learn to live, love, and deal with each other in a `Survivor' like fashion. One even starts their own form of government! The side stories about other Star Wars fans are priceless. Star Wars - The Musical and a DJ Boba Fett are worth the viewing alone!
As soon as I saw it was coming to DVD, I snatched this sucker up! (...)You get all these extras that really cool.  Even the commentary by the director is really good, when most of the DVD you get they're pretty boring conversations.
Fan or no fan, this is a great movie and the best one on fandom I've ever seen.  A laughfest with heart!  Sit back, have a pizza some brew, and enjoy!",1004832000,,972,4.21505376344086
1655704,5,B00005RIYD,"...The rapping D.J. Bobba Fett was my favorite, but then again, so was the trip that the toys took to their original locations.
My friend bought the VHS and it had a special introduction by the filmmaker that was great! I just bought the VHS too!
IndieDVD has come through again and their teamng up with Film Threat is proof that they are to FILM what Punk Rock is to MUSIC.",1004313600,2,374,4.28169014084507
1655705,5,B00005RIYD,"I gotta hand it to the guy who put this together. Not only did he stay objective in the 42 days spent with these nuts, he made a film that is as much a kind tribute them as an expose on fanaticism.  This film easily rivals ""Trekkies"".  If you are a Star Wars fan, you have to get this!",1003449600,3,285,3.8135593220338984
1655706,4,B00005RIYD,"With all the hype and hoopla around the DVD release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, it's easy to forget the amazing frenzy that occurred around the theatrical release of the movie. Waiting a few minutes in line this week at your local retail store or a couple of days for your DVD to arrive from an online retailer just doesn't compare to the Star Wars Fanatics who spent as long as six weeks waiting in line to be the first to see Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.
Starwoids is a very entertaining look at what it's like to be a Star Wars Fanatic, to not only get caught up in Star Wars frenzy but be a part of it. Watching Starwoids I couldn't help drawing comparisons to Trekkies, a documentary about Star Trek Fandom. While I think Trekkies was a fantastic documentary I enjoyed Starwoids even more. Trekkies felt like it was showing the absurdity of Extreme Fandom while in many ways Starwoids celebrates it. The makers of Starwoids waited in line along side other fans for 42 days, and their film really feels like its 'from the trenches'.
Starwoids is introduced by Kevin Smith who also does an interview on the DVD about the influence of Star Wars on his movies (ever thought that Jay and Silent Bob are a lot like C3PO and R2D2?). It's an interesting interview, and I would have liked to have seen even more. So after you watch Star Wars: The Phantom Menace on DVD be sure to check out Starwoids for a great look at the entire movie phenomenon.

1655707,5,B00005RIYD,"I was lucky enough to view this documentary when it was being passed around Los Angeles some months ago like so much gold.  I totally loathe the word ""buzz"" but that is what this Starwoids had in these hallowed parts.  Finally I got my paws on a copy and it completely lived up to the great things I was hearing.  Hilarious, moving, a total tribute to not only Star Wars but all films and the people who love them.  Don't miss this one.  It is for fans, friends of fans, grandmothers of fans.  Share it with your fave cinegeek.",1002758400,,527,4.2727272727272725
1655708,5,B00005RIYD,"I saw this film when it screened at the Egyptian in Hollywood, and thought it was hysterical.  It's one of those rare documentaries about extremely odd people that is really on the side of the extremely odd person.  The obvious comparison is with the movie ""Trekkies,"" but while that film simply spotlighted the Star Trek aficionado in general, ""StarWoids"" takes the Star Wars enthusiast and puts them in a context -- the countdown to the opening of ""Phantom Menace,"" the folks who waited in the lines, and the rivalries that develop between and among them.  Przywara is at the top of his game here.  Truly inspired viewing for fan-geeks and the people who love them.",1002240000,,667,4.773913043478261
1655709,4,B00005RIYD,"For those who were unable to participate in the mayhem that was generated by Episode One, you will be inspired to do so with this documentary.
A funny and smart film driven by fans, this ride will take you through Death Valley, to the Lucas Ranch, on a competitive toy run and then back to the lines forming at two theaters around Los Angeles. Fun stops along the way include, an interview with Uncle Owen, discussions with two homeless film critics, a priest, and scenes from ""Star Wars the Musical"".
Starwoids revives the term ""documentary"".
With loyality, it details creative activities that are produced by dedicated fans.",1001808000,4,626,4.859813084112149

Never realized TPM lineup was actually hosted by Countdown and there was also a Westwood Village Lineup, if you a SW Fan and want to see the Story of Fans that devoted many week's of their time to being there, at the Front for the 12:01 Screening you must own this DVD. May the Force be With You!!!!

7952464,4,B00005RIYD,"So what is a starwoid?  A Starwoid is someone who is completely nut about the movie Star Wars.  These are the people who are first in line to purchase the latest action figure, see the latest movie, and usually the person who talks non-stop about Star Wars.  But what really separates these people from the regular herd is these are usually the people who show up in costume. So why did this film earn a 4 star rating?

It would have earned a five star rating but the film quality is a bit lower than expected.  I figured it would be higher quality considering Kevin Smith did some of the narration in this film, but it looks mostly like video camera footage.  So how did it earn the four stars?

Well I have always had an interest in why so many people went crazy when they found out George Lucas was making a new Star Wars movie.  Recall the people standing in lines 42 days before the movie even premiered?  Remember the People who went Nuts At Toys R Us just get their first glance at the Latest Action Figures?  Or how about watching people maxing out their credit Cards to buy these items?  That is what intrigued me.

Anyways the main part of the movie is about a group of people who stood in line for 42 days just to buy tickets to first showing of the Episode I and the media frenzy that surrounded it.

But do not think that is all there is to it.

Footage includes:

those who went to see a now forgotten movie just to see the Trailer to the NEW Star Wars Film,
a Guy who created a Musical Version Of Star Wars,
those who went nuts at Toys R Us just to get the Latest Star Wars Toys,
the search for where they filmed certain Desert Sequences from the Original Star Wars movie,
Star Wars Celebration I in Denver Colorado (Funny scene from two guys who attended the festival dressed as Klingons)
and much more.",1282003200,,1819,4.262390670553936
7952465,5,B00005RIYD,"This portrait of Star Wars fans awaiting the opening of Episode One is entertaining, often hilarious, strangely endearing, and just generally a very well done documentary.  The slice of life quality is only enhanced by the sometimes rough shooting conditions.  While I like Star Wars, I'm not quite a ""Starwoid,"" yet I still found the film emminently watchable and a great deal of fun.
For DVD viewers, the extras section is far better than I have seen in many high-budget releases.  Although subtitles might have been a useful feature that is missing, make sure you catch the Kevin Smith interview, the out-takes from the Star Wars musical, not to mention the delightful and often side-splitting bantering during the director's commentary.
Overall, this documentary is more than worth its price.",1065312000,2,796,5.155038759689923
7952466,4,B00005RIYD,"I loved this documentary, and so did my wife who's not a Star Wars fan. We were both cracking up at the scene with the Jawa who couldn't keep his eye on, and the raid on Skywalker Ranch. Super Genius was awesome. He's a Hip Hop/Breakbeat DJ that wears a Boba Fett costume (complete with a turntable on his back instead of a rocket pack). His short film (available as an extra on the DVD) is wonderful. Breakdancing Stormtroopers, brought to life through stop-motion animation. I want to get his Star Wars Breakbeats CD, that he mentions on the documentary. There's a nice piece on the Star Wars Musical, that was produced by high school students in Northern California. You get an interview with one of the original Jawas from Episode IV (A New Hope), and an interview from Phil Brown (Uncle Owen). Plus all the fun and drama of waiting in line for 42 days to see the most anticipated movie of all time. The commentary is also very informative, giving you more background on the filmmakers and the people in line. Extras include an interview with Kevin Smith, deleted scenes (including more from Star Wars the Musical, the Super Genius short film and other stuff). If you're a Star Wars fan you'll want this DVD. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan you'll still enjoy it.",1020729600,,1270,4.550218340611353
7952467,1,B00005RIYD,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!!! I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE STRICTLY OFF THE REVIEWS, AND I TRULY WISH I HAD NOT.
I am a Star Wars nut. I now realize that I'm not a nut of watching Star Wars lunatics. I thought this would be an interesting glimpse into another aspect of the Star Wars realm, one that's not heavily documented elsewhere. However I was unbelievably disappointed to find out that this was nothing more than a documentary of several people in the months, weeks, and days ahead of Episode 1, with 90% of it devoted to the people waiting in line. If you think standing in line is boring, you should see how agonizing it is to watch people waiting in line, especially over a period of months. This movie has no spark, no inspiration, and no appeal whatsoever...and I'll watch anything Star Wars. This film was basically the equivalent of a news program, where they stand outside a movie theater and ask people as they're waiting or as they're leaving what they think.
Don't buy this movie, don't rent this movie, don't even watch it at a friend's house. It's not even worth 5 minutes of your time, let alone the whole film.",1019260800,27,1123,4.509803921568627

7952469,5,B00005RIYD,"I'll have to admit, I was expecting another stereotypical Star Wars doc (i.e. ""why do you like Star Wars?"" times 100) Starwoids is so much more!  For example, it has a plot and humor; both uncommon in fan documentaries.  I'm not saying its all things to all fans, but... wait, that's what I'm saying.  Check it out!  (Its also on my ""moderately priced"" gift list for friends who already own the Episode I DVD.)",1006214400,,410,4.5

I was extremely surprised that there could be a documentary about fandom that was not only interesting but also extremely funny.  I recomend this film to not only fans but also to the friends and family of fans.",1005004800,,347,4.2272727272727275
