8008558,3,B00019G8CE,"Being attracted to Klee's art in a  modern art history course at university, I decided to look at this dvd to get what I hoped was more in depth than a mere overview.  But this is only an overview with so much left out I was quite disappointed.  In this film there is no mention of how WW1 affected his art.  No mention of what mediums he used in his various works & why.  Selected work is shown quickly with a very brief commentary which leaves the viewer with more questions than information.  I also watched one of these on Magritte and was again disappointed.  I don't know exactly who these films were intended for but the information jumps from basic enough for a middle schooler to esoteric comments only a fine artist might relate to.  Poorly edited.  Back to good old-fashioned books for in-depth information.",1473552000,,818,4.5479452054794525
8008559,1,B00019G8CE,"This is a terrible PowerPoint, not a film.  It relies on sophomoric formal criticism that is dry and completely unrelated to the world Klee lived in, inner or outer.  There is a mention of the Bauhaus, but none of World Wars I and II.  Klee was conscripted in the German army in World War I and before World War II he was forced to leave Germany due to Nazi policies against modernist art.
Klee was one of the most articulate and poetic of artists.  Why not use his own words?
Much of the film is a recitation of the title and date of each piece with nothing else.  The actual photographs used of the works are of poor quality.
Music played a huge part in Klee's life; the film score is unrelieved wallpaper.
The narrator mispronounces Klee's name throughout the film, which is irritating.  Also someone should have corrected his pronunciation of gouache, not ""gooo-ash!""
And ""The Twittering Machine"" is shown twice.  Was the film's editor awake?",1341360000,3,946,4.62874251497006
8008560,4,B00019G8CE,"This is a great film and I recommend it for all looking to know more about Paul Klee.  However, the narrator's voice is not very inspiring and, though one grows used to it, could have been much better.  Also, he pronounces ""Kleeee"" instead of ""Clay"", which is confusing.  The documentary aspect is sort of lame - there's no real talk of the era, only some mention of contemporaries, and he's died within the first ten minutes.  However, the film gives you lots and lots of Klee's art, close up and beautiful.  You get lots of titles and dates and plenty of close up art.  There is even a bit of art historian style interpretation of the art, its execution, drawing attention to some details, styles, and only a wee little bit about the man.  But just to sit there and look at art, with thumb hovering near the pause button is delightfully rich and rewarding, and I recommend it with this approach.",1213228800,3,897,4.5
8008561,5,B00019G8CE,"Paul Klee (Artists of the 20th Century) presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is competent, detailed enough, and quite comprehensive, but only for a person with a solid art knowledge and established art understanding who is immune to the contentious remarks made by the narrator sporadically. Some works considered self-explanatory by the narrator are left without a comment. This documentary includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional work analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good.",1196640000,7,624,5.443298969072165
8008562,2,B00019G8CE,"Almost a second after mentioning his date of birth, the narrator states when Klee got married.  At three and a half minutes, the date of his death comes up.  One never gets to see a photo of the artist (cameras did exist at that time).  So this was almost entirely about his work.

They stress his musical background.  I think his work was meant to create a type of synesthesia.  They mention so much painting that he did in the 1910s, but World War I never comes up.  Maybe he was a purposely apolitical artist.  Eventually, the  narrator mentions Picasso and cubism, but schools and fellow artists hardly come up.

If you like dry, but deep, art lectures, then this is for you.",1185840000,8,679,4.4471544715447155
8008563,2,B00019G8CE,"The images on the DVD aren't as clear as you'd like. The biography is cursory. There is no linkage with museums/cultural sites.  There is no investigation of how Klee developed his unique style.

If you are buying to show to elementary students, it'll do.

It sure didn't jazz my socks.",1178928000,8,286,4.68
