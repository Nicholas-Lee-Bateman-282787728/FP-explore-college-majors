So yeah, I'm sure I didn't get the complete picture from beginning to end.  That being said, I think this video is worth purchasing for two reasons.  One being Johnny Layton's part....I don't know if dude is pro yet or what, but he should be for sure.  He's apparently only 21 or something silly like that...way younger than me, but I'm saying this because he skates like a MAN.  Frontside and backside wallrides over the railing and onto the wall down a 10-stair or something crazy like that.  His part ends with a huge out-of-ditch gap into the street, clearing a fence and a good additional 10 ft. in the process.  I've never really heard of him before stumbling on this video part, but I'm sure we'll all be mad aware of him in the near future.  On to the second and equally important reason, the aformentioned ""secret super am"" stealthy mentioned in the product description.  If you haven't been paying attention to skateboarding much as of late, then I forgive you for not knowing who this is, but if you have then you know who it is.  It's none other than this kooky kid from AZ named Nick Trapasso, who's video part (and all-around skating/style) is beyond sick.  Jaw-dropping smoothness and graceful 360s abound.  I'm gonna go for the over-mentioned description of his skating looking as if he's going to fall asleep on his board.  His style is laidback, lazy and flawless.  Definitely the most exciting AM around right now.  Plus, he's rockin' pretty crazy clothes, ie. checked black & yellow pants that a tight-rolled at the cuffs....so-so dope.  So basically get this DVD for these two reasons, wham-bam thank you ams.",1200441600,2,1843,4.7125
