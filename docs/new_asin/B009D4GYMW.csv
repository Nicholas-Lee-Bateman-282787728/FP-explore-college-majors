8539915,4,B009D4GYMW,"I played this for my grandchildren, ages 6 & 7.  It held their attention and gave a good overview of Moses' life -- baby in the bullrushes, raised by Pharoah's daughter, fled to Midian, Burning Bush, Return to Egypt, confrontation with Pharoah and the Plagues and then the Passover.  However, the disappointment was that it stopped short of the parting of the Red Sea.  Certainly not a deal killer and I highly recommend the film for this age group, but IMHO, no story about Moses in Egypt should skip the Red Sea.",1427932800,,514,4.565217391304348
8539916,5,B009D4GYMW,The ending of this vedio connected something that was not clear to me as I have been reading and studing the Bible for many years.  The fact that Joseph being sold and ending up in Egypt relulted in Moses being sent by God to bring the his people out of Egypt.  I purchased this vedio for my Grand Children and it is a very good product.,1420588800,,337,4.090909090909091
