8440948,4,B004TTOMKM,Saw this movie when it first came out in theaters. I have always been a Rogers fan and was pleased with the story and how handsome Rogers appeared; even to a young college student like I was at the time. Can't wait to see this movie again.,1423526400,,239,4.1063829787234045
8440949,5,B004TTOMKM,"I had the soundtrack on vinyl and always wanted to see the movie. I searched for many years and finally got to own it, the package is boring but the movie is what matters. I am just glad to have it.",1416960000,,198,3.8536585365853657
8440950,5,B004TTOMKM,"I was anxious to watch this movies during its' theatrical run. It is set in an America that vanished a long time ago, but it was the America I came of age in. Watching it again here on Amazon Prime it transported me back to the many times I rode through Dickens, Guthrie and Benjamin, on the way from Lubbock to Dallas; a trip that took from sunup to sundown. Lunch was a bologna sandwich at a roadside table because there weren't McDonald's in every little town. Now you can eat breakfast in Lubbock and lunch in Dallas, at the cost of seeing the scenery along the way.",1407024000,,570,4.287037037037037
8440951,4,B004TTOMKM,As an old Roy Rogers fan I enjoyed watching him in action one last time. I believe this was the last movie he made. Thanks Amazon Prime for making it available.,1398556800,,160,4.193548387096774
8440952,5,B004TTOMKM,My Mom & Dad took myself and 2 sisters to see this movie when it first came out. Had to get it and see it again. Great old movie.,1392336000,2,129,3.4827586206896552
8440953,1,B004TTOMKM,"I want to order this but WHY OH WHY is Amazon swlling these bootlegged copies to the public? If not for the public itself one would not know what one is buying!

It is next to IMPOSSIBLe to get a legal good copy of this movie and I want to see it so bad but can't see spending money for what I know is inferior and all but illegal! IF ANYONE out there has a legal original they would copy nad send me I will be glad to pay you for it.

My inquiries to Mr Penland have so far gone unanswered. I don't even want to rate this item but requires it so did what I have to do to post this.",1346457600,,582,3.7235772357723578
8440954,1,B004TTOMKM,"This is truly a great movie but definitely a new type of hero for Roy Rogers. It moves slowly at a more natural life like pace but the story is still very compelling. A hard working cowboy ranch hand who is nearing retirement and struggling to make it from day to day. This part is perfect for Roy Roger and reflect the maturing of the film industry. But beware of all the bad illegal copies, particularly the Black Artwork Case. These are illegal, unauthorized, bootleg copies!

I recently bought a copy of Mackintosh and T.J. and discovered that it was a horrible illegal copy with lots of problems. After searching several sites I found Penland Productions which produced and owns the Copyright to this great movie. After sending the a few messages to Mr. Tim Penland he contacted me himself and told me my copy was an illegal copy. He seemed more concerned about the lack of a good product than the theft although this pirating has cost him and his family dearly. He sent me copy of the movie and the difference is incredible. His DVD has a wonderful 13 minute onsite film of the actual production of the movie. It was so neat to see these actors interact and hear them just having a good time filming the movie. Reluctantly, Mr. Penland is now in the process of having these illegal sales shut down by whatever means it takes.

The cover on the legal copy is a brightly colored photo artwork compiled from scenes in the movie and the back cover also has photos and a description of the movie plot and actors. Please don't buy, rent or download one of the BLACK COVER ads for this movie, they are all illegal copies. Mr Penland went to a lot of expense and financial risk to produce this fine product for fans of Roy Rogers and deserves to reap the benefits of his hard work. He related to me some of the trials he went through in producing this film and bring it to market. It truly was a labor of love. Tim, like all of us looking at his film, shares that same deep connection to Roy Rogers. If Roy were alive today he would be appalled at the level of dishonesty that has surround his last movie. As a true fan of Roy Rogers I believe a certain level of loyalty, honesty and integrity is what we all loved most about Roy. We should emulate those qualities and not stoop to seeing Roy's last movie at the expense and loss of someone else. Mr Penland took huge risks and made a fairly substantial financial investment to produce this film. Why should we support those who steal from others rather than work for an honest living. I for one can tell you that once I saw the original movie it was well worth the extra expense. Life is too short to sell your birthright for a mess of pottage. Do the right thing, its what Roy would do. I read about one fellow who ended up with a bad copy that quit playing after an hour and reordered it with the same result. Get the real deal and have something you can enjoy for a lifetime. BEWARE OF THE BOOTLEG BLACK ARTWORK COVERS!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mackintosh-TJ/dp/B004W0Y74O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mackintosh & TJ</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mackintosh-TJ/dp/B004TTOMKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mackintosh & TJ</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mackintosh-TJ/dp/B004W0Y7LM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mackintosh & TJ</a>",1316822400,16,3403,4.968421052631579
8440955,1,B004TTOMKM,"Ordered this twice.  First time it stopped at fifty minutes.  Sent it back to Amazon.  Amazon coundn't have responded in a more timley manner.  The only problem was the second one stopped at fifty minutes, same spot, same way.  Enjoyed what I saw of the movie, would like to see the conclussion some day.  Will not order a third time.",1311465600,4,334,4.483333333333333
8440956,5,B004TTOMKM,"I would rate the quality of this DVD as very good.

This little-known movie was made in 1976 almost 25 years after Roy Rogers made his last B-western film for Republic, ""Pals of the Golden West"" (1951).  Roy would have been about 65.  Although it is more of an ""adult-type drama"" comparable to a story you might find on TV's Gunsmoke, it retains the old values which made Roy Rogers such a popular draw at the box office from 1935 through 1951.  Furthermore, the film provides Roy a chance to act, and he meets the challenge.  The story is about a drifting old ranch hand, who once was one of the best.  I especially liked the scenes with Roy and his co-star, Clay O'Brien, as he befriends the kid in a fatherly way and guides him away from a possible life of crime and helps the kid to feel good about himself.  This old cowboy, Mackintosh, lost a lot over the years, as did Roy, but neither gave up.  Whenever I now have some canned peaches, I think about this movie and the old pickup truck with the leaky radiator, which somehow enables them to move on down the road, even someday, perhaps, all the way to the Pacific Ocean.  Roy doesn't sing in the movie.  Most of the music in the film, background singing, is provided aptly by Waylon Jennings.  It is not a typical Roy Rogers movie, but it is a good Roy Rogers movie.",1307404800,12,1324,4.319838056680162
