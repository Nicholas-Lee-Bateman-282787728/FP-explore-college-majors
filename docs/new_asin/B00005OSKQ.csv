1641708,2,B00005OSKQ,"This movie is all about dinosaurs and some story thrown in for good means!
A spaceship crashes on a desert planet inhabited by dinosaurs. The crew tries to survive and some get eaten by carnivores in bad mood. Thats about it!
There is plenty of well executed stop motion and funny dialogues from an innocent age of b-movies. It's not Gone with the Wind but it sure has entertainment values.
The DVD quality could have been better in dark scenes (...)",1004572800,6,450,4.567901234567901

1641712,2,B00005OSKQ,"This movie has it all. A trifecta of poor filmography. Poor directing, Poor acting and Poor special effects. It might offer some comedic value in those states that now offer legal recreational marijuana use. I watched it through to the end, knowing that it would not get better, yet getting some satisfaction from the fact that I was getting it free with Amazon Prime.

1641714,1,B00005OSKQ,One almost must watch this to see how bad it is.  Special effect: god awful esp. the dinosaurs. Acting: some of the worst possible Direction: more akin to Ed Wood.  Sound: the only way it could be worse is if there were no sound.  The first dinosaur is sooooooo fake.  It eats a terrible actress which takes a few seconds and everyone is just 'Oh well'.  They are stranded on another planet and act like their car broke down.  When the main ship 'explodes' it doesn't even break apart but just disappears with flashing lights.  This isn't just a bad film.  This is bottom of the barrel.  I don't even think a 4 year old could take it seriously.  Just imagine my review if I paid to see it.,1495843200,3,689,4.271317829457364

It wasn't so bad that I had to stop watching though I'll admit to fast forwarding through several parts. The special effects were about 20 years behind but just below par for a B movie of the 70's.

1641746,5,B00005OSKQ,"Ever hear of the saying, ""It's so bad, it's good""?  Well, that's Planet of the Dinosaurs.  The acting is atrocious, sort of gets better.  The music is horrible; it's some kind of synthetic sound.  The background is okay for a dino world, the creatures in it are good.  Back then it won an award for being the best in creature effects, but for now-a-days, it's just okay.  And why can't Chuck just find his shirt?  And why are the women strong at one point, yet helpless in another?  It just didn't add up sometimes.

Despite all that, I like the plot.  Starship crash lands on an uncharted planet.  Survivors have to learn to live with the dinosaurs or be eaten.  As bad as this movie is I watch it every year and plan to get it in dvd format for my birthday this year as I just have it in vhs form.

1641768,3,B00005OSKQ,"I was relatively enthusiastic about seeing this movie, since I really vdidn't know what to expect from it. Given the plot, I didn't expect many people to die. Well, it's true that not many people died, but more people died than I was expecting.

One weird thing is that people turn their back on some kind of Brachiosaur and within about two minutes they see a half-eaten Brachiosaur. I'm not sure if its supposed to be the same one, but if it is that's really stupid.

There's conflict between two central chracters, but surprisingly, they both live through the whole thing, and there's an ""epilouge"" scene where there's no tension between them. However, IT IS NEVER EXPLAINED WHY THERE'S NO TENSION BETWEEN THEM. There's no scene at any point in the movie explaning what happened.

In an amazing feat of inconsistancy, high-technology ray guns can't harm very small dinosaurs, but spears have no trouble peircing them.

Did I mention that this movie features a T-Rex (or possibly an Allosaurus) with a lower IQ than most inanimate objects?

Overall, it wasn't really a waste of time, but it was kind of on the edge of being disappointing. It's still not as bad as RAPTOR or the original JURASSIC PARK",1155427200,3,1202,4.759615384615385
1641769,3,B00005OSKQ,"My sister and I have long had a soft place in our hearts for this late-70's sci-fi effort.  The back of the DVD hypes it as a bold space adventure with spectacular effects and a gripping plot.  I don't know what movie they were watching when they wrote that, but it wasn't Planet of Dinosaurs.  It tries so hard to be deep and profound, following its sad little band of stranded astronauts as they try to survive on a prehistoric world, that you have to feel sorry for it.  Nice dino FX (for the time) aside, this is a B-grade work all the way, with terrible acting, lousy lines, pointless characters who mostly exist to provide the local wildlife with ample fodder, and hilariously lame music.

1641770,4,B00005OSKQ,"A cast of unknowns in dodgy spandex jumpsuits fight off a medley of prehistoric beasties on a planet that looks surprisingly like Earth. Yes, the acting, dialogue, costumes and music are straight out of a bad 70s porno, BUT this forgotten nugget offers cool stop-motion dino action aplenty, and it's fairly fast-paced, as well. This isn't one of those movies where you hardly ever see the monster (and when you do, it's a total letdown). The critters here get quite a lot of screen time, and they're pretty well-animated to boot. Pity the filmmakers only spent about $1.50 on the rest of the movie, but hey, you've gotta give 'em an A for effort. This movie took me back to the TV shows and movies I loved as a kid growing up in the 70s, when production values were lower but the fun quotient was higher. Good stuff.

1641771,3,B00005OSKQ,"Remember the first 40 minutes of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" in which the surviving team of a spacecraft explore the desert-like environment of the mysterious planet wherein they crash? (It was the best part of the movie, except for the very end). Okay, imagine that scenario for an entire 84 minute flick, albeit WITHOUT notable actors, great soundtrack and first-rate filmmaking; not to mention replace the apes with dinosaurs. If you can picture that, and it sounds like your cup of java, you might want to pick up ""Planet of the Dinosaurs.""

This flim is so amateurishly done on most levels that the average person would likely view it as a 2-Star flick. I grant it 3-Stars, however, for five notable reasons:

-- The picture was filmed at Vasquez Rocks, Northeast of Los Angeles (I visited this park in July of 2003). If you're not in the know, this location is where many of the original Star Trek episodes where filmed, such as ""Arena"" wherein Captain Kirk fights the Lizardman.
-- The stop-motion dinosaur animation is very good for the time period and, I hear, won some kind of an award when the film was released in the late '70s. It's pretty much on a par with ""One Million Years B.C.""
-- There are four (count 'em, four) female survivors of the space wreck and two of them are babes (the other two aren't that bad either, that is, if you're stranded on a deserted planet). One beauty unfortunately gets eaten almost immediately, but the other survives for quite awhile. The latter, by the way, appears to be of Native American ancestry and her tight outfit shows off her midrift and bellybutton the entire stint she appears in the film. And, trust me, if you have any doubt that American Indian women can be truly beautiful, you need to see this fine piece of womanhood.
-- After the first 20-30 minutes I was able to mentally adjust and accept the film's limitations; I strangely started to get into the story at this point and even care about the characters.
-- Lastly, this is definitely not a kiddy flick, nor is it goofy, comedic or even campy. It's a serious sci-fi story.

If ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" had better actors, sound, music and worked out various other kinks in the story, direction, etc. it would certainly be a 4 or 5-Star film.

BOTTOM LINE: It's worth picking up if (like me) you're a sucker for Sci-fi survival-on-deserted-planet type flicks. Just keep in mind it's strictly Grade Z and mental adjustments will have to be made to appreciate it.

""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" has garnered a worthy ""guilty pleasure"" spot in the cult/independant film section of my video library.",1129161600,4,2614,4.686274509803922
1641772,5,B00005OSKQ,"I'm going to start by saying this- if you don't like really, really cheesy, bad movies, then you're not going to like ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"".

 On the other hand, if you can appreciate a really bad movie for how good it is underneath all the cheese, terrible acting, and hideous special effects, then this movie is probably the penultimate late 1970's cheesy sci-fi horror pic.

 The intrepid crew of ""The Odyssey"" (played by an ensemble cast of nobody you've ever heard of) crash lands on distant planet populated by fierce dinosaurs. Armed only with a few lasers (with are terribly ineffective against dinosaurs) and their wits, they must learn to survive on this harsh new world.

 The special effects in this movie are actually not that bad for the genre. The stop-motion dinosaurs are a little silly sometimes, but overall the stop-motion is pretty good. The movie actually won a ""Best Special Effects"" award at a Science Fiction festival for it's special effects, so you know that at one time they were pretty good.

 The acting is horrible. But not horrible in a ""Matt Damon"" kind of way... more like horrible in a ""this is the best movie I've ever seen"" way. You'll probably have to pause the movie after a few choice lines, to give yourself time to laugh the tears out of your eyes.

 The music is... interesting. It fits the movie pretty well, but it's not really music so much as unpleasant noises strung together to form basic melodies. Granted, it's perfect for the movie, but if you ever heard it somewhere else, you'd be convinced there was a dying cat nearby.

 I don't know if you've ever seen ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", but this movie is basically like one of the ones they watch on that show. If you like that show (and those types of movies), you'll probably love ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"". Personally, as someone with a great deal of experience in bad B-movies from the late 1970's, I am firm in my belief that ""Planet of the Dinosaurs"" is and shall remain the best bad movie ever made.",1105660800,18,2015,4.629213483146067

1641782,5,B00005OSKQ,"'Planet of the Dinosaurs' is a typical sci-fi cheapie from 1979 starring nobody of any note. A spaceship explodes (in a visually amusing 'special' effect) and the survivors end up on a hostile planet ruled by dinosaurs, hence the title. The acting is fairly awful (particularly among male cast members) and the spaceship effects are fairly laughable, but the dinosaurs are done with stop motion (by Douglas Beswick), and are actually amazingly well done. In fact, they are about as good as stop motion dinosaurs can be done. For that alone the movie is worth seeing, but the interplay with the humans is priceless (wait till you see some of the human vs. dinosaur battle scenes.) In fact the humans are as bad as the dinosaurs are good. Interestingly everyone is wearing hideous 1970s one piece disco survival ensemble uniforms, which make the downright homely cast appear even dowdier. The only remotely attractive human in the film is the gorgeous Mary Appleseth, who is, unfortunately, eaten by creatures early on.
This film is also a favorite of mine for a totally different reason. Footage of the spaceship and dinosaurs was bought for $500 and used in the appallingly hilarious 'Galaxy of the Dinosaurs' in 1992, with additional footage shot on location in Mogadore, Ohio (behind the producer's parents house, if memory serves me correctly.) It is available in the ""Bad Movie Police"" series on DVD from Amazon, and it is highly recommended as well as this, the original.
This is a type of movie not seen anymore. Bad acting and varying quality scenery and effects combine to make this a quintessential low budget sci-fi film from the 1970s. It's good in its own unique way, so go ahead and check it out.",1082073600,39,1709,4.8561643835616435
1641783,5,B00005OSKQ,"I got this movie on VHS from my grandma and grandpa when I turned five back in 1990. And from the moment I first watched it, I loved it! Being a huge dinosaur fan, I had to love it. It holds a special place in my heart because I have loved it ever since I was young!
Sure most people are going to think it's stupid and corny, but it is enjoyable! People who are fans of dinosaurs/sci-fi films will love this movie.
It's a shame though that most people won't pick movies like these up anymore cause they are too old. Everyone is into the new stuff and let me tell you something, these movies made the movies of today! Most people are so un-cultered nowadays!
This is a worthy buy! For $5 I was shocked to see it at that price! I was at least expecting $10 but seeing as there are no extras, it wouldn't be worth that amount of money. The color and all is much better than the VHS version, but during some of the night scenes, seem so dark that you quite actually tell what's going on. Sure there are specks of dust and all on the film, but being a B movie, what would you expect?
The acting is good and corny in some parts, but bearable. All in all, this movie is a classic that EVERYONE needs to see at least once!",1080604800,6,1214,4.0625
1641784,1,B00005OSKQ,"This is a lame movie. It is bad. It needs the MST3K treatment. Due to an engine malfunction, the crew of a spaceship are forced to eject over a strange prehistoric planet. There they are locked in a life-and-death struggle with enormous dinosaurs. They spend about 75 minutes of walking and it seems to be in circles. It's like they found a small piece of land and it looks like they are always in the same place. Things don't add up, things don't make sense. What's even funnier is the fact the people change sizes compared to the dinos. At one point one of the guys is up to the T-Rex's knee, but when he is eaten, he's like as big as the dinos head. There are several inconsistencies in the movie. This is worse than the infamous ""Sidehackers"" and that's saying alot. This is a piece of garbage, and it's a pain to sit through. It's like a severe flauging. Actually getting beat with a cat of nine tails is the closet I can describe the experience of watching this movie. I could tell it was going to be a real stinker, but it outstripped my expectations. First off, it's from the late seventies, and you can tell by the costumes, which it appears to be men in rejected star trek suits, wet suits, and one girl who is a hippy, sonny and cher, and well anyway, completed by track shoes. It looks like it was shot on tail ends of every grade of film stock there is, the acting wasn't even community-theater level, and to be honest a third grade play has better acting than this film. The script needed a gazillion more drafts, and the music... oh, the music... that cheap seventies electronic score...it's terrible. It sounds like they took someone else's score and played it backwards. Special effects? Laughable even for that day and age! The ""spaceship"" looks like a bunch of septic pipes, and the ""escape craft's"" amazing crash scene uses footage from Planet of the Apes, and when it is sinking it looks like a huge cardboard cut out. There are alot of things wrong with this, and it so qualifies as one of the worse movies ever made!!! Oddly enough, the stop-motion dinosaurs were okay sub Harryhausen, but definitely would have been respectable in the fifties. The worst part is, I can see what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish. They wanted to do a variation of a cliche premise of putting several strong-willed characters into a difficult situation and watch the fireworks fly. Unfortunately, the lame script was so repetitive that every argument sounded like deja vu. I mean they repeat each conversation over and over and over and over. Goodness. As you can see, my reivew is all mismatched, but that's because I'm so confused and can't really find any redeeming qualities. It sux!!!",1080432000,4,2701,4.594202898550725
1641785,5,B00005OSKQ,"Sometimes production companies try to make a b-movie, and it's no secret that it's supposed to be funny.  Those moves are lame.  Planet of the Dinosaurs, however, is AWESOME.  Each line of the horrible dialog is delivered with all the intensity of a Knight Rider-era Hasselhoff.  You actually get the impression that they were trying to make a decent movie, and that makes it even more hilarious.  I first saw this on tv when I was a kid.  I was excited to see that it was out on DVD!  The dinosaurs are most likely totally innacurate and out of scale if you asked a paleontolgist, but see, these are SPACE dinosaurs! ROCK!  The best part is the plot.  They crash, some of them die, and then they never find a way off the planet!  It just ends with a scene of them washing their clothes in a pond!  Their space suits are rad, and the dude's beard is sweet! Easily worth 5 stars.",1064102400,17,878,4.325153374233129
1641786,4,B00005OSKQ,"This is a pretty corny movie from the late 70's. A space ship crash lands on a planet that ends up having dinasaurs on it! Of course the plot is pretty dumb, and the special effects are stop motion (clay-mation), plus the acting is typical of low budget sci-fi of the era, and the diolouge and is cheesy. Pretty muc hthe whole movie is cheesy. And that's what makes it enjoyable.
By all accounts the special effects actually aren't all that bad. Little kids will probably like this movie and if you liked the older godzillas, Gorgo, 20 Million Miles to Earth, Them, or any of the other nostalgic sci-fi adventures, then you wqill probably like this. If you're looking for a movie you can take 100% seriously in the year 2003, then forget it.
It's worth noting that the DVD is only MONO, but with a movie like this you aren't going to get a ""remastered"" version. The sound shows it's age, and more so the picture quality on the DVD version shows specks here and there. This is disapointing, but atleast it's full screen so we don't have to stare at black bars. I only wish they had cleaned up the sound and picture a bit. But hell, for less than 5 buck what do you expect!",1042848000,8,1171,4.351598173515982

1641788,1,B00005OSKQ,"A spaceship crashes on a planet similar to Earth, but with one major exception: it's filled with man-eating beasts. The rest of the movie's plot follows the crew as they attempt to adjust to their new life. That's it. Pretty lame plot, huh. Well, the dialogue is worse that the plot, the acting worse than the dialogue, and the music worse than the acting. The cinematography is horrible as is the lighting.

The only upscale about the film are the stop-action dinosaurs which are well done. Normally, something like that would improve the quality of the film somewhat. Not here, though. Everything is so bad, that not even the dinosaurs can save this film from utter disaster.",1037059200,2,677,4.786324786324786

1641790,3,B00005OSKQ,"If you crossed Planet of the Apes with One Million Years B.C., youd get something that looks like Planet of the Dinosaurs.  Trouble is, it appears that most of the budget went into the stop-motion dinosaurs, which are admittedly quite good.  The story line is OK, but the bad dialog and, mostly, amateur acting almost sink this low budget science fiction film.
The plot is simple with the entire opening sequence virtually ripping off Planet of the Apes, as a futuristic spacecraft crashes into a lake on a seemingly desolated planet.  From there its man versus man-eating dinosaurs for the remainder of the film.  Who will get eaten and who will survive?  Thats the entire plot, in a nutshell.
The cast is comprised of virtually all unknowns, save James Whitworth who had a fairly successful B-movie career throughout the 1970s and is probably best known as the leader of the mutant desert family in The Hills Have Eyes and its sequel.  With the exception of the stop-motion dinosaurs, the films low budget is apparent in every scene, from the mostly outdoor exterior scenes (very few indoor sets were used) to the jumpsuits that are supposed to represent space flight suits and the knock-off Nike sneakers that the male crew members wear.  The actors blow dry hairstyles are straight out of Saturday Night Fever.
Still, if you can get past the low budget, bad dialog and acting, Planet of the Dinosaurs does have its moments like the scene where a large spider attacks one of the crews female members.  The Goodtimes DVD is nothing special, just the film (in full frame) and 12 chapter breaks which are adequate for the films 84 minute running time.  My three star rating is closer to two and one-half stars.",1023321600,3,1710,4.769491525423729
7949000,2,B00005OSKQ,"While this movie has the veneer of a possibly fun B movie with low budget, cheapo effects, and a plot written at a 5th grade level emoted by people dragged onto the set from various bus stops.  BUT ... to qualify as a notorious, memorable B movie ... it has to be cheesy FUN not just cheesy.  This movie has a zero fun factor and no low budget charisma.  The typical shallow B plot becomes dull and repetitive very early on.  The best B movies at least attempt some variation in tone, plot, or location.  This one has a fatal flaw.  It is simply dull.  Sorry,  at least Plan 9 and The Puppet People had a modicum of imagination despite poor execution.",1526515200,,651,4.278688524590164
