2074696,5,B0002B95MG,"I picked this up from Canada, Series two on 3 discs.  This was a great British mystery show that aired on A & E in the early 90's then just completely disappeared.  I never understood that.  The only way to enjoy this show was to buy the 4 episode VHS set for a rather high price.  Now, the shows can be enjoyed on dvd with the great English countryside as a backdrop for Lovejoy, Tinker, and Eric to do what they do best.  The episodes are:

Just Desserts

The Italian Venus

Bin Diving

Montezuma's Revenge

Who Dares Sings

One Born Every Minute

National Wealth

Sugar and Spice

Raise The Hispanic

Lily's Pearls

Riding in Rollers

The Black Virgin of Vladimir

This also includes part 2 of an exclusive interview with Ian McShane.  If you enjoyed this show when it aired over a decade ago, you must pick this up, great stuff.  Over 600 minutes!",1177027200,8,851,4.402597402597403
2074697,5,B0002B95MG,"This is the second series of Lovejoy episodes. While the first still retained a heavy flavour of Gash's books, in series 2, McShane began to flesh out the dotty character and make it his own. I think these episodes are some of the best of the whole series. These were just so GOOD!

1) Just Desserts

2) Italian Venus

3) Bin Diving

4) Montezuma Revenge

5) Who Dares Sings

6) One Born Every Minute

7) National Wealth

8) Sugar and Spice

9)Raise the Hispanic

10) Lily's Pearls

11) Riding in Rollers

12) The Black Virgin of Vladimir (double episode)

You also get the second part of the interview with McShane talking about his character.

It just does not get any better than this. Again, super BBC transfers and a nifty price.",1157500800,19,734,4.5038167938931295

I think most customers are like me in that they do not buy something and then do a marathon to ensure they function as advertised.  If you order series from Amazon I guess you have to watch every disc as soon as you get it.  In my case the 1st and 2nd discs in series two do not work.  The episodes will not play.

2074767,5,B0002B95MG,This a wonderful series loosely based on the Jonathan Gash book series.  Ian McShane & his cohorts bring fun & romance into every episode.

2074795,4,B0002B95MG,"My wife and I discovered ""Lovejoy"" by an accidental viewing on television and were hooked since.  It had a limited run then and I finally took the plunge and bought several seasons.  The first few were not televised when I was viewing, so these are all new to me.  We enjoy the cast and the shows provide a welcome relief from typical television fare.  While based on books, the characters appear to be differently portrayed, with the main character being a little more loveable and less sleazy.  Be forewarned:  the first season has a little profanity and brief nudity that I was not expecting.
The plots are light hearted and usually entail Lovejoy helping someone in need though we are meant to think that he is a scoundrel.  He is perpetually low on cash and always has a scam going.
I truly enjoy this series and am glad that I purchased this set.",1221436800,,852,4.529411764705882

Ian McShane is brilliant as the antiques dealer Lovejoy and his interaction with the cast of characters...Lady Jane, Tinker and Eric makes this show such a joy, no pun intended, to watch.

2074799,5,B0002B95MG,"Lovejoy is always entertaining, sometimes funny and occasionally romantic.  Imagine someone with a sixth sense regarding true antiques who just can't seem to do well in the trade.  He is always chasing the elusive great antique item and usually falling a little short, mostly because someone needs the money or whatever more than he.  He skirts the law and often brushes it a little too close, but in the end right will out, even if it does not favor him.

The transferring of Jonathan Gash's sly, clever antiques dealer, always somehow existing in the shadows of normal society, was an inspired idea.

2074822,5,B0002B95MG,"In my opinion, THIS is the penultimate series of Lovejoy.  It has two (well, the series ender is a two part episode) of my three absolute favorite episodes--that I can recall--from when they were shown on A&E network.  (""the Italian Venus"", ""Black virgin of vladimir"".)  Personally, this is one of the few shows produced for TV which A) don't insult my intelligence (There were accurate references to the then current art world, for instance) and B) is so entertaining I'm sure it will keep me watching for a very long time.  Lovejoy's ""under the radar"" scams--""just trying to make an honest crust""--continue as well as his pursuit of Lady Jane, with Tinker and Eric along for the fun.  You won't regret buying this, unless your idea of fun is pro wrestling or something... :)  It's not much like anything else on TV, even when it was being broadcast.
But if you enjoy shows/movies where the little guy ""makes a find""--in this case antiques--and profits well from it, or, scams some fink who is an even bigger scammer, then I'm certain you'll enjoy it as well.",1205971200,5,1060,4.702702702702703
2074823,5,B0002B95MG,"Lovejoy is probably one of the most complex comedy-dramas ever to be exported from the BBC. The stars are quite charming and the tales of their antique finds always have a great mix of adventure and mystery. The relationships between all of the characters are multi-leveled and not what I have been used to on most TV shows. I think that those who only know Ian McShane from his fine performances in HBO's ""Deadwood"" will be pleasently surprised. Dudley Sutton as his alcoholic, yet knowledgeable,  associate and Chris Jury as his less-than-stellar apprentice add to the shows' appeal and the ever-present, unattainable Lady Jane (Phyllis Logan)adds a strangely platonic love interest for our hero. I also truly enjoy the rich variety of settings, both indoors and out. This program constantly gives little snippets of life in the U.K. and shows the complete range from the very wealthiest to those who scratch out a living on the bottom rungs of society. Try it and I think you'll enjoy it too.",1205280000,5,995,4.887573964497041
2074824,5,B0002B95MG,"One of the best series to come out of Great Britain. The format is unique: a somewhat unconventional, somewhat rogue antiques dealer navigates his way through the wheeling, dealing deception-ridden world of antiques, with the help of an unconventional crew of helpers - a boozing veteran of the trade, a wealthy lady of the manor hungry for intrigue and a young apprentice who seems to find more trouble than is necessary. Through it all Lovejoy manages to make out in his marginal business by thwarting the villians and protecting the less fortunate and less experienced - truely a modern day Robin Hood.

2074827,5,B0002B95MG,"Lovejoy was one of those rare series that improved with age.  The stories kept getting better bcause the characters kept getting deeper.  In season two, we explore some of the inner workings of Lovejoy, Lady Feldsham, Tink, and Eric.  We meet the ex-Mrs. Lovejoy and Lovejoy becomes a more credible parent.  It's a joy to see how organically these actors inhabit their roles and great credit belongs to the story editors for maintaining a seamless consistency of the characterizations. Lovejoy's prison term was stroke of brilliance to explain the hiatus between seasons one and two.  It added incredible dramatic gravity to Lovejoy's wily savoirfaire.  We know he knows the consequences of his actions but he chooses to remain the lovable rascal nonetheless.  More, please!",1202428800,4,774,5.193548387096774
2074828,5,B0002B95MG,"Lovejoy is typical (and an excellent) example of British light comedy/drama, with investigative undertones.

Lovejoy, however, doesn't so much go out of his way to investigate matters, as stumble upon things that aren't right and which require his expertise in 'putting right'. It seems, the Antique Trade is full of 'questionable' matters and people!

Consummate acting and writing, allied to superb direction, makes the entire Lovejoy Series one of the very best examples of this particular (and extremely popular) gendre.  Their strength - and, I suppose, their weakness - is that if you don't like one, you are unlikely to like another.  The plus side to all this is that, if you DO like one, you'll thoroughly enjoy the remainder - of whatever episode and series!

In a nut shell, a first class show; without question.",1202169600,5,823,5.022058823529412
2074829,5,B0002B95MG,"For American audiences, this is the first season of Lovejoy.  This show premiered on A&E in 1991 with The Black Virgin of Vladmir.  This was probably done as a tie in to Dallas.  In 1988, Ian McShane joined the cast of Dallas as movie producer Don Lockwood to become Sue Ellen's love interest.  The end of the season, both characters left the show to be together in London.  Two years later Linda Gray returned the favor by doing a guest on his television series Lovejoy.

The following are the episodes on this set:

Just Deserts - Lovejoy has returned from doing time after being set up.  Now he has returned home to find out who really did it.

The Italian Venus - Jane asks for Lovejoy's help to get the inheritance a friend of her's is due from his brother.  Lovejoy does this with a fake statue.

Bin Diving - (That means looking in trash bins for salvagable items.)  Once again Lady Jane gets Lovejoy in trouble.  After Jane has Lovejoy value the goods of an elderly widow, the antiques are stolen and of course, Lovejoy is the police's prime suspect.

Montezuma's Revenge - When Lovejoy is asked to sell a pre-Columbian solid gold, two murders occur.  It's upto Lovejoy to solve the mystery.

Who Dares, Sings - Lovejoy and Lady Jane are hired to decorate pub but Lovejoy finds out you can't even trust the police.

One Born Every Minute - Lovejoy is hired to find a local lothario, who paints pictures of homes and uses this to seduce the lady of the house.  But once again, everything is not what it seems.

National Wealth - Lovejoy is hired by a former film star, who Tinker has a crush on, to arrange an auction. But her house is robbed, just like a number of other country homes.  It's Lovejoy to the rescue.

Sugar and Spice - This time it's Lovejoy's daughter who gets him in trouble.  We get to meet his ex-wife, too.

Raise the Hispanic - Lovejoy is hired to furnish a house as a wedding present from the bride's father.  But nothing is that easy for Lovejoy, when he finds the groom in a suit of amour - well the dead groom.

Lily's Pearls - Lord Felsham has a new partner but as usual, nothing is as it seems.  Lord Felsham's partner has secrets including his wife Lily's pearls.

The Black Virgin of Vladmir - (the best episode) - American widow Cassandra Lynch is swindled by Harry Catapodis and Lovejoy decides not only to get even but teach Harry a lesson, in one of the series most complicated and funny cons.

Ian McShane is great as the rougish Lovejoy and Phyllis Logan is the perfect unattainable love interest.  Add to this Chris Jury and Duddley Sutton as the perfect accomplices and you have a great cast.

This series is a cultural icon in Britan.  The name Lovejoy is synanamous with the antiques trade.  If you watch any of the BBC antiques show (Cash in the Attic or Bargin Hunt), you will hear people referred to Lovejoys.

If you enjoy witty well written shows with a cast that is obviously a great time, this is your show.",1200441600,20,2961,4.434137291280148
2074830,5,B0002B95MG,"The long overdue US success that Ian McShane enjoyed as Al Swearengen in the HBO series Deadwood may be responsible for the equally long overdue release of Lovejoy, the superb British series seen on A & E back in the early 1990s, on DVD. In Deadwood, McShane took his penchant for playing lovable rogues and darkened his portrayal by several orders of magnitude, while simultaneously investing a three-syllable expletive with an almost Shakespearean eloquence. But the seeds of that brilliant performance can be found here, in a charming, slightly corrupt but never mean character, whose talents as a 'divvy' or diviner of the true identity and worth of obscure antiques, makes him highly sought after by those on both sides of the law who are 'collectors' of the objects of Lovejoy's obsession.

What makes the Lovejoy character so interesting is his authentic love for things old and beautiful. His passionate concern is with their true value and not their mere monetary worth. It is only when he engages in a rare bit of forgery now and then, of which he is also a master, that monetary considerations are paramount. Of course, Lovejoy invariably winds up giving the proceeds to some needy soul, one usually fleeced by the more nefarious characters who populate the darker realms of the antiques world, including the obnoxious Charlie Gimbert (Malcolm Tierney), an unscrupulous antiques dealer who is the anti-Lovejoy. Lovejoy's unrequited love for Lady Jane (Phyllis Logan), his fiercely loyal friendship with his gone-to-seed partner, the usually tipsy Tinker (Dudley Sutton), his tolerance for his resentful apprentice Eric (Chris Jury), provide the skeletal structure around which numerous clever and well-written scripts are constructed.

The show hits its stride in the second season, first broadcast in 1991, five years after the 1986 premiere of the truncated (10 episode) first season. That delay was caused by lengthy contractual difficulties. The twelve 1991 episodes include:
1) Just Desserts
2) The Italian Venus
3) Bin Diving
4) Montezuma's Revenge
5) Who Dares, Sings
6) One Born Every Minute
7) National Wealth
8) Sugar and Spice
9) Raise the Hispanic
10) Lily's Pearls
11) Riding in Rollers
12) The Black Virgin of Vladimir (the last two a two hour episode)

This is a superbly entertaining and intelligently written television show. If mysteries leavened with light comedy, as well as a healthy dose of the fascinating world of antiques and art, interest you, then you will love this show. Most strongly recommended.

Not faithful adaptations by any means - McShane's Lovejoy is much nicer than his written inspiration - but worth watching again and again.",1516752000,,271,4.666666666666667
8025593,5,B0002B95MG,"This is the 2nd of 6 Seasons of a highly entertaining, comic and interesting series.
Season 1 first aired in 1986, and Season 2 didn't appear until 1991. We're happy the network came to their senses and gave us the continuing story of the moderately unscrupulous Lovejoy, antique dealer extraordinaire. Watch the 1st episode to find out what a ""smurf"" is in the British antiques trade!

...1... ""Just Desserts"" Lovejoy is doing a monthly ""bring your antiques"" gig at the Wisley Green Women's Institute. He's actually not thrilled about it, but it does get him out of prison for a while. Prison!!? Yes, six months for trading in stolen goods. And when he gets out, he's going to find who set him up.
...2... ""The Italian Venus"" Someone is making bronze horse statuettes which are better than the original, a dead giveaway to Lovejoy that they're fakes. This caper has Lovejoy doing his favorite thing  putting one over on the deserving.
It also has this saying, ""The donkey's finally seen the fishing rod."" Took me a while to figure it out. Think of trying to motivate a donkey by dangling a fishing rod over its head with a bunch of carrots at the end of the line.
...3... ""Bin Diving"" Eric is driving his motorcycle around a neighborhood and checking the garbage cans for any likely items. Unfortunately, the garbage truck drivers see him taking a hat stand, and tell him, ""It's ours, not yours.... We don't allow bin diving on our round. Persistent offenders usually end up in the fracture clinic.""
...4... ""Montezuma's Revenge"" Eric gets hold of a gold statue that will be worth a fortune in commission. If only it wasn't cursed.
...5... ""Who Dares, Sings"" Lovejoy's Antiques has run out of money. An apparent fix, doesn't and it turns into a bad day for everyone, from a stolen car to getting scammed into a burglary.
...6... ""One Born Every Minute"" Lovejoy gets a commission, but it's unusual. Major Chatfield wants him to find Ashley Wilkes, an itinerant painter. He wants to hire him, which no body believes. A painter named after Scarlett O'Hara's first love?
...7... ""National Wealth"" Eric reads a newspaper article: ""Last week, another chateau in northern France was sold. The Japanese Yan Zi Corporation paid 10 million francs for what will become their European headquarters. The value was substantially reduced after thieves had stripped the house shortly before the auction sale."" Will some of the stolen goods make it into Lovejoy's hands?
But never mind, there is something more important going on. Madelaine Gilbert, retired movie star, needs to auction off valuables to pay death duties, and Tinker is hopelessly star struck.
...8... ""Sugar & Spice""  A high school student comes into Lovejoy Antiques looking to sell Victorian pornography by Fuseli. Very valuable to the right collector. Lovejoy muses, ""She's not the kind of girl who owns pornography. She steals it.""
This is one of the funnier episodes.
...9... ""Raising the Hispanic"" Ralph Peagram is an old friend and customer of Lovejoy's. So Lovejoy is invited to the wedding of Ralph's daughter. When the chauffeur arrives to take the married couple on their honeymoon, they've both disappeared into thin air.
..10... ""Lily's Pearls"" Lord and Lady Felsham are having a black tie event, and invited the American, Joe Gruder, a potential business partner. Before hand, we see Joe and his loving wife, Lily, in her ridiculous blue & pink dress. Joe asks her, ""You never wear them pearls no more."" And that's why Lovejoy gets involved, them pearls.
..11..and ..12... ""Riding in Rollers"" and ""The Black Virgin of Vladimir"", a two-part story. Lovejoy is introduced to Harry Catapodis (played with gusto by Brian Blessed) who just got back from Moscow. He tells Lovejoy, ""Moscow is the last great art market in the world. A whole lake full of stuff that's been dammed up for over 700 years."" But how legit is this Madison Avenue showman?
This is a great story of antique revenge!

The 12 episodes of ""Lovejoy Season 2"" originally aired January through March of 1991. They total about 620 minutes and are presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio. English subtitles are available on the episodes and on the two Bonus Features:
...A... ""Ian McShane Talks About Lovejoy: Part 2"" ( 10 minutes) A 2004 interview with McShane, who plays Lovejoy, is divided into six parts. A part appears on each of six Season sets.
Of the last episode, McShane says, ""Brian Blessed, the only man that could play that part. He'd just come back from climbing Everest, or nearly climbing Everest, for the second time.""
...B... ""BBC Interview with Ian McShane"" (12 minutes) This is Ian's guest appearance on the live daytime chat show, ""Scene Today"" and originally aired 1-28-91, when Season 2 had just begun airing itself. Listen to this to hear a great story about Richard Burton, when McShane worked with him on a movie.

Another enjoyable season of ""Lovejoy"".
