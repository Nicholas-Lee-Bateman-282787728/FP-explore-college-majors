6453765,5,B00KY9N0S6,"Finally get to own one of the best shows from my childhood!  Its over 10 years later and I still love watching the show!  The video and sound quality is good.  For anyone looking to remember their childhood, or wanting to introduce their kids to a new group of student athletes, make sure and pick up your copy of each season of Rocket Power!",1410134400,2,342,4.3125
6453766,5,B00KY9N0S6,Of course I love it... it's Rocket Power!!,1407024000,3,42,4.375
6453767,5,B00KY9N0S6,Part 2 of 3 (or i guess in Nick's case 4) of my childhood that encouraged my sporting phase.,1404950400,4,92,3.8947368421052633
6453768,3,B00KY9N0S6,"I got this in the mail exactly on time. However, the case they put the discs in was broken. It doesn't close at all! I'm very disappointed I paid this much for the dvd set and they sent me a completely broken case. I am still happy to have the dvds and such but just very disappointed that whoever put these in the case couldn't take the time to put it in a non-broken case.",1404604800,2,374,4.0
6453769,1,B00KY9N0S6,There are a few episodes of this show that we really didn't like especially Hurricane Maurice and Womp Race.  These were both scary compared to some of the more fun shows they have.,1403395200,,181,4.484848484848484
6453770,3,B00KY9N0S6,"all the episodes are correct expect Losers Weepers/Reggie: The Movie"" is in the third season not season 2 of rocket power",1403222400,3,121,4.809523809523809
6453771,5,B00KY9N0S6,"Another 20 half-hour shows make up the 2nd season of Rocket Power, all with 2 11-minute episodes per show! It even has not one, but 2 holiday episodes; one for Independence Day (the 4th of July for the USA) and the other for April Fool's Day, which is today when I typed this, no foolin'! April Fool's Day is also Founder's Day for Ocean Shores in California, since that's where the main cast lives in the whole series. No matter what time of the year it is, Team Rocket always shares great times and bad ones together, mostly started by Otto's reckless behavior and getting them in trouble with their elders, or even having a busted leg in Otto's case once, which is the previous season 1 set! Reggie, alias Regina, alias Rocket Girl, has the front cover and menus' picture this time, alongside her own little brother Otto for season 1! Once you have the 1st season of Rocket Power, make sure it doesn't get lonely, add this and seasons 3 and 4 to it, if you want to! Here's to Team Rocket making yet another great classic Nicktoon together! As their handshake goes... ""WoogieWoogieWoogieWoogieWoogie...!"", even when sharing it with their other friends and their families!",1459468800,2,1173,4.671497584541063

6453773,5,B00KY9N0S6,"I loved Rocket Power as a kid and still love it to this day! I can not completely describe how thrilled and excited I was to find these on amazon! Since it is made on demand, it has a very simple menu. I don't even care about the menu. It allows me to pick and choose my episodes. The only problem with this is that the intro is super loud and then the rest of the episode is rather quiet. It doesn't even bother me enough to take away a star. This is the best thing to happen in my adult life and I can't wait to share this.",1456790400,,525,3.8256880733944953
