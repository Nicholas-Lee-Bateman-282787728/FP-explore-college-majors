937921,4,6304899351,"If you like old movies, and you like Cary Grant, this is definitely one you should see.  Cary Grant, who plays Ernest Bliss, starts out as an unhappy, unsatisfied rich man with no meaning or direction in his life.  Thinking he is ill, he seeks professional help from a doctor who seems to have become cynical towards his wealthy patients.  The doctor prescribes that Ernest start over with no money and work and live on his own using none of his inherited fortune for himself for an entire year.  The doctor, of course, doesn't think that rich Ernest can handle that so Ernest makes him a bet that he can.

What follows, is Ernest's ""amazing adventure"" with different jobs  that teach him the lessons of life.  He meets average ordinary people on his journey and learns that there is definitely more to happiness than money.  Sometimes, it is the people with the least or the people you least expect who end up giving the most.

The movie is only about an hour long so it doesn't feel like parts of it get dragged out.  I got the Alpha Video DVD release which was OK.  The visuals definitely looked like an old movie with scratches and blacked out sections of frames that go by in a split second here and there.  There are even a couple of minor skips which don't take away from the movie, but they were a little distracting to me.  The audio was slightly muffled in spots but again, not enough to deter me from this film.  If anything, these minor flaws add to the charm of this old movie.  Of course, if the visuals could be made crisp and clear and the audio cleaned up enough to sharpen the sound, I wouldn't complain.

Cary Grant is what makes this film very enjoyable.  The supporting cast is alright but it is Cary Grant who you can see emerging as the legendary star.  When he smiles, he warms your heart and this movie's overall lessons are things all of us can be reminded of often.",1142467200,77,1892,4.403458213256484
937922,2,6304899351,"This is one of Cary Grant's least memorable films...which is why I'd never heard of it.  Produced on a very low budget, the episodic story makes very little sense, and the behavior of the characters strains credibility.  Grant has no chemistry with his leading lady, so there's no reason to care if they end up together. It's all made even worse by a simply terrible DVD, apparently made from a mediocre 16mm print, with splices and scratches and very poor sound.  There's no reason to have this DVD in your collection -- if you feel compelled to see it, rent it.  Note that there are used copies available for less than $1, so that should tell you something about the quality of this one.",1140825600,,689,4.532258064516129
937923,4,6304899351,"When Cary Grant inherits copious fortune, he sets out to earn his living from the beginning as if nothing would happened. A very curious way to self redemption and a formidable motive to build a very smart comedy.",1131062400,4,213,4.631578947368421
937924,3,6304899351,"I ordered this DVD from one of the Amazon Marketplace sellers --it had two movies on the same disk (""Double Feature""), from Dollar Entertainment in a keep case: The Amazing Adventure (1936, British, originally titled The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss, 63 min., Maltin's Movie Guide shows 70 min., IMDb shows 80 min. UK and USA: 61 min.),  with Cary Grant - filmed in England, and My Love For Yours (1939) (USA - video title), a.k.a. Honeymoon in Bali, Are Husbands Necessary? (USA) (working title), Husbands or Lovers (UK) 95 minutes, with Fred MacMurray, Madeleine Carroll, Allan Jones (what a set of tonsils on that man), Akim Tamiroff, among other really good actors, and the really sweet Caroline Lee.  It was extremely well written and timely even by today's standards.  (SPOILER: ""I'm not a feminist...,"" says the main character, who owns her own large department store).  There are reviews for this movie under it's own title -- a good family movie in general except for a scene where Fred MacMurray pushes Madeleine Carroll down--might bother younger viewers.  My Love for Yours was a pristine print, I must say.  The Amazing Adventure was a good movie that I had also not seen before, but apparently the master was in really poor condition in that it had streaks and glitches, breaks in the film (sentences not finished) but clear images and still enjoyable.  I recommend both movies.",1120262400,,1393,4.902127659574468
937925,2,6304899351,"Ok, so I bought this DVD because one of my all time favorite actors is in it (I'm a huge Jimmy Stewart fan too!). While this movie was a good back drop for Cary Grant, the plot was a bit bland...spoiled rich man must make his own living for a year to win a bet. Some of the meetings with his ""monied"" crowd, while he's a working stiff, are entertaing, but not really memorable. Maybe I'm used to his later movies where he really shined, but this movie just didn't grab me. Or maybe it was the quality of the DVD. I might have gotten more out of it if I had turned the sound off, the sound track was that bad. There were a few skips and the usual ""old film"" wrinkles in the visual, but they wouldn't have been so hard to deal with if I didn't have to keep adjusting the sound....even then, some of the dialogue still sounded like gibberish. Could be that I've just got a really bad bootleg copy. I advise against purchasing the DVD whose cover case shows CG from the shoulders up in front of a car and stone house.",1090540800,27,1013,4.121212121212121
937926,4,6304899351,"If I was ever amazed by an inexpensive DVD, this was the one.  Sure, time has taken its toll on the film print. Sure, the transfer to DVD could be better, in fact it could have been much better.  But, IF you are able to ignore some natural degradation, a little grain, and a couple of minor skips(not enough to interfer with continuity) YOU ARE IN FOR A REAL TREAT !
With its ""Depression Era"" overtones, this movie exemplifies many forgotten attitudes, ambitions and values of the 1930's.  It presents clear character lessons that are timeless in relevance.  View it once, and then view it again with your grandparents/grandchildren.  You may be surprised by their comments.
For some real comedy pay particular attention to the apartment fight scene.  You might have to push the ""pause"" button until you stop laughing.
My guess is that this DVD will be highly enjoyed by all ages under 10, over 50, and all those between 11 and 49 who are able to look beyond the purely superficial.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BY Jim & Veda",993168000,147,1015,4.64245810055866
937927,4,6304899351,"Not many people enjoy watching ""old black and white"" movies anymore. The claims I hear most are that there isn't enough action, there are no special effects, and the plots are boring. Many of those same complaints can be made about modern movies as well. The biggest difference is that you can't take your whole family to see those films because of all the swearing, violence, and sex whereas a family can enjoy watcing an old film together without any worry of having to blind the youngsters eyes and cover their ears.
AMAZING ADVENTURE is not a great movie; it's just the usual run of the mill love story. However, there is one exception that makes the movie a par above the rest: Cary Grant. I have yet to see a bad movie in which he acted. Not only that, but Grant had the rare ability to take even the most mudane movie moments and transform them into cinematic magic. Such is the case with AMAZING ADVENTURE. The plot of the movie revolves around a rich young man who has inherited a tremendous fortune. He finds himself becoming ill and seeks the help and advice of a doctor. The doctor tells him that he is physically fit, but is affected by the disease of money. He places a bet with the young man, challenging him to work for one year by his own means and not by using his inherited fortune. What follows is the ""amazing adventure"" as Grant moves from one job to the next, learning lessons of humility, and falling in love. Youngsters may find the movie boring, but adults will probably enjoy it and the lessons the film instills can't be heard enough in contemporary society.",989798400,282,1586,4.491349480968858

The Amazing Adventure begins when an indolent rich swag , Ernest Bless (Cary Grant), goes to a doctor complaining of a mystery illness. The doctor in frustration speaks his mind and lets the young guy know that nothing is lacking but lack of work. They spar with words and end up with a bet: Bliss does one year of hard work without using his own money or position or connections for his own use in any way OR he pays the doctor 50,000 pounds for his work in the slums of London.

In a Depression style up-from-the-dust move, Bliss goes out with only five bucks and learns to live and see the world through the eyes of those who struggle the most. He too starves and scrapes by, falls back on rent, and gets fired from a job. But he sticks it out and persevere, showing everyone in the audience that they can continue on too.

938429,3,6304899351,"From early in Grant's film career, 1936, and not as polished an actor as he would later become.  The script is formulaic: We've all seen the ""rich guy posing as poor, looking for the meaning of life"" story many times since this film, and it probably wasn't the first, even when it was made.  However, that being said, Decency, Honor, Fair Play, are all recognized, and approvingly.  The script gets a little creaky as it tries to navigate the moral issues associated with having wealth vs a desperate need for money.  I could not suspend my disbelief that the female lead wasn't marrying Grant for his money.

So, where are we?  Early work for Grant. Creaky script. Ending that strains credulity.  But the film succeeds because the language is fine, it's a morality play that turns out happily, no one is blown up, and there are no high-speed car chases.  So it's a pleasant way to spend an hour.",1441152000,4,896,4.591194968553459

He seeks out the help of diagnostician, Sir James Alroyd (Peter Gawthorne), who sternly tells him that he suffers from what might be called today, ""Affluenza"". Yep, Ernest is filthy rich and bored stiff. So, Alroyd suggests that he walk away from his wealth and position for a while. he further suggests that Ernest take an actual job for regular wages! At first offended, Ernest eventually takes Alroyd up on his challenge (Alroyd sees it more as his prescription). With only fifty pounds in his pocket, Ernest sets out on his endeavor, and finds work as a stove salesman. For the first time in his life, Ernest experiences rejection, failure, and poverty. He also discovers what it means to help others in need, without receiving anything for himself. Coming to the end of his salesman career, Ernest becomes a chauffeur! However, his penchant for giving has just gotten started! During his chauffeur job, Ernest discovers something amiss back at his old residence. Something unseemly, involving criminal types. Ernest gets embroiled in a scheme to defraud... himself! Hilarity ensues. But, Wait! The adventure's not over yet! THE AMAZING ADVENTURE is a quiet, humorous story w/ moral lessons and social insights. Grant is (of course) brilliant, as is Mary Brian as Bliss' love interest, Frances Clayton.

The real problem here is the running time of the print, with some 18 minutes missing from the original UK version (and also a poor print copy); it is really choppy with a lot of 'transitions' in the story going unexplained and making virtually no sense.

938726,4,6304899351,"""The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss"" was this sweet little film's original title when it was released in 1936.  Buff and fit from his many years as a vaudeville acrobat, singer and dancer, Mr. Grant returned to his native England from his new home in the US to make it.  He loved the script - it was a welcome departure from the dark films he had made in in the '20s and early 30's. It also led to his being cast in later British and American-made films where he played the ""good guy"" that helps others, which is very much the man he really was.  The rest of the cast is largely unknown to modern American audiences, although Mary Brian was one of the few who successfully made the transition from silent films to talkies. It's great fun to watch and fairly well done (except for a VERY silly fight scene). Watch for a young Ralph Richardson's cameo as a restaurant waiter.",1403222400,,872,4.37037037037037

938730,4,6304899351,"The scene is London, 1937. A very young Cary Grant is  a wealthy man who has never worked in his life, and who temporarily puts his riches on hold while seeking fulfillment by becoming one of the working class. Feeling unwell, he had paid a visit to a Harley Street doctor, who diagnosed Grant's problem as ennui due to too much money and easy living and who bet him 50,000 pounds he would not be able to join the working class for an entire year, living on a vastly reduced income. Having been disenchanted with his  monied life, Cary Grant readily accepts the bet. His character, Ernest Bliss is ironic, for Ernest is by no means blissful but could be said to be earnest.

Although this is a delightful film Cary Grant in no way resembles a common laborer or salesman. Even when selling stoves he is debonaire, dressed in tweedy sports suits that  no ordinary salesman could afford. He learns a lesson to be sure, that  money is not necessary for happiness and through this  adventure he witnesses poverty, sadness, greed, the gamut of human emotions that he had never experienced. Of course he meets a girl, played competently by Mary Brian who  is a humble secretary. Grant  in his search for happiness  witnesses the things that really matter in life- loyalty, kindness, love,  even vulnerability and contentment with what you have. And above all, the ability to be happy.

Some of the scenes and items in this long ago movie will astonish a modern audience, such as the primitive-looking stove Grant is obliged to hawk. I don't recall Grant smoking cigarettes in any movie of his I have seen and he puffs away until embarked on his adventure for enlightenment. The movie is only about an hour long and comes close to being corny. But it's Grant who carries it along. His very presence  guarantees satisfaction, satisfaction with  the man who more or less invented himself. There is nobody like him!",1397520000,9,1904,4.681681681681682

All in all though, if your a Cary Grant fan it's definitely worth the three dollars its on amazon for right now. Not a die hard fan? Skip this and splurge on Father Goose, Operation Petticoat, Bringing Up Baby or the like.

  For those of you who want a synopsis: (SPOILER ALERT) it's about a rich young man who goes to the Dr about an ""ailment""and is informed that it's from being (in my words) bored,rich, and lazy. The Dr insults him, has no pity on his plight and refuses to shake his hand upon parting. Grant, pride hurt, takes the Dr's flippant remark about not being able to handle his perscription(go a year without money and make a man of himself by actually earning a living for once) as a bet and sets out determined to not only prove the Doc wrong, but also come back deserving a handshake. On the way he learns to better himself, makes & helps some new friends(who of course, have no idea that he is rich) and falls in love...the girl is the secretary of Grant's first boss...she is the typical love interest, and regards him at first with disdain as he (in desperation after weeks unemployed)talks her boss into giving him a job they all know he's not qualified for-selling kitchen stoves. After finding out  that the man is getting ready to lose his business, Grant takes his money(which he is allowed to use in this case as it is for someone else not him)and hosts a huge demo with the stoves. He gets a lot of orders for the company and makes it an overnight success. The owner, in turn tries to make him a partner but of course,Grant turns it down to win the bet and sets out to find another job. The secretary also leaves as the owner proposes and she is not in love with him....some more stuff happens,new job as chauffer,getting to know the secretary, making friends on the job, observes Dr compassionately caring for the poor(he just so happens to end up the Dr's chauffer...Dr has forgotten all about the bet and man and never recognizes him) etc. And finally we come to the conclusion-Grant wants to marry the girl but is afraid she'll reject him when she finds out who he is... girl meanwhile has found out her sister is ill and needs money. She runs off without telling Grant and goes to marry her former boss, Grant catches her in time, marries her, takes care of her family, and goes ahead and pays the bet to the Dr.  Even though he won, he knows that the Dr could really use the money to help his poorer patients. He finally gets the handshake that the Dr had refused him in the beginning of the movie  And that's about the jist of it.",1395878400,,2731,4.366141732283465

But, at heart, Cary Grant was a sad man; one who needed exactly the kind of woman he found here in this short film.  I cannot help be admire the character he plays, mainly because it represents who he just might have been, in his private, and trouble-plagued lifetime.
He started as a poor young man, and worked hard to find the success he found in films throughout his career.  He fought studio politics, back-stabbers ~ not be mention the film ""industry"" itself.

938856,3,6304899351,"INSPIRING THEMES: Two cultures and lifestyles are contrasted in this film with the intention of showing the virtues of one and the dishonor of the other. It isn't wealth itself that is condemned, but the culture and lifestyle of these particular selfish and lazy wealthy people. Ernest Bliss (Cary Grant) creates a memorable picture of a man who ""has it all"", but is very unhappy in his self serving life. Complaining of physical ailments, he goes to the doctor, who boldly tells him that he will be cured if he simply earns his own living for one year. (Where are the doctors like that?) Offended, by the doctor's words, Ernest makes an official agreement with the doctor that he will do just that. Earning his own living is a hard life for Ernest, but as he suffers, he learns to have compassion on others.

He also learns the satisfaction in struggling to earn his own ""bread and board"" as well as sharing what he has earned with others. New friends are made and their character is shown in contrast to his old crowd. They made themselves feel superior but in actuality they treated others poorly, were enslaved to their own selfishness, sin and drunkenness, and had inner dissatisfaction as well. We see the truth illustrated that people are made to live for a greater purpose than themselves and have a greater sense of inner satisfaction when they do work with purpose that includes sacrificial service of others.

There is a funny scene where Cary Grant carries out his plans to singlehandedly catch some crooks who have moved into his home and taken over his bank account. This is at the end of the film showing that he is now responsible, capable and has a sense self sufficiency about handling his own problems, by showing both justice and mercy towards the thieves. Overall, virtue is glorified and many of the truths in the book of Proverbs are brought to light in this meaningful escapade.

PARENTAL WARNINGS: A young woman's employer takes her out to dinner, but has unholy intentions. Cary Grant saves the day, before her boss puts the pressure on. Nevertheless, the subject matter of that scene, is mature, if it doesn't go over the heads of youngsters. Cary Grant has a romantic interest, which ends in marriage. There is one fighting scene as well that is not relatively violent but could be agitating for some more sensitive children. The film print quality is low, and the story does not have a lot of bells and whistles, making it more less likely to hold the interest of those under 10 years old or so. However, those who are patient with the developing plot will be rewarded with an impression that inspires to virtue!",1373932800,,2641,4.699784017278618

The quality of DVD does not detract from the story itself. Yes Cary Grant is the strong one in the program, yet all the others add to the story line! I would have liked a little different ending with the 'crooks', would have sold off a bunch of the artifacts, etc. [many got busted up!] and started with a fresh lovely home for the bride at her choice, but that is probably the genuine country girl within me :).
A story for all time and a good lesson, especially for those with 'money to throw away'. There a lot of good places for money to help out.
A lot of what was accomplished was done with the money. There is a purpose for money. It has a place in our world and God will use it in the Kingdom purposes. We need to not have greed [as it says - money is not evil itself; the love of money - which is greed - is the problem.]
It is maybe more of a 'grownup' movie, yet if you can have a family night with the youth, it would instill some good life lessons.
And Cary Grant comes forth again. [I don't know it the lady star, Mary, went on in acting, yet she could have done so and done well, I think. And I would enjoy the older land lady elsewhere, also. She touches the heart :).]",1360713600,2,1310,3.965909090909091

British-made THE AMAZING ADVENTURE (originally ""The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss"") features a low-key Cary Grant at the top of his game as an indolent son of wealth who attempts to earn his physician's respect by betting he can forsake family riches and comfort and make his way in the world for a year, starting with only a small wardrobe and 5 in his pocket.

In this typical mid-Depression Era romantic comedy, uppercrust Bliss gets an education in how the working class lives. Along the way he also finds compassion for his fellow creature, becomes a better man himself, falls in love with a real sweety (Miss Brian) and wins his wager with the doctor.

The biggest difference is that you can't take your whole family to see those films because of all the swearing, violence, and sex whereas a family can enjoy watcing an old film together without any worry of having to blind the youngsters eyes and cover their ears.

It is not listed on box or in descriptions but when I went to put disk in, in very fine print it said Side A...  side B.  Penny Serenade.  Did no one else see this???  Well I put the disk in to watch side A  ""Amazing Adventures""  Feel good movie :) I enjoyed it much and now I flipped the disk and I'm watching Penny Serenade.
 It would be easy to overlook the second movie but if you own this disk and I bought it ""new"" and sealed from Amazon, flip your disk over!
The quality of the movies could be better and I wish it had subtitles but for 5.99 I can't beat the deal of both movies.

Along the way, he is only allowed to use his money to help others, and he abides by the agreement despite some cost to himself personally. Yup, he makes it through the challenge, because he is basically a strong-willed person who was told he didn't have the guts to stay the course, and he discovers he wants to do the right thing.

Sure it's rather hokey, but wouldn't it be great if an obscenely rich someone today had the guts to learn what it was like to live this way beyond the 8 hours a day for the week or so it takes to do a ""reality"" show. OK, off my soapbox.

The acting isn't great, but the lesson is. I'd watch Cary Grant in almost anything. This is a movie I wanted my grandchildren to see. The modern day equivalent is ""The Ultimate Gift"", also worth seeing for a moral tale. (I like moral tales.)",1271116800,,911,4.170454545454546

British-made THE AMAZING ADVENTURE (originally ""The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss"") features a low-key Cary Grant at the top of his game as an indolent son of wealth who attempts to earn his physician's respect by betting he can forsake family riches and comfort and make his way in the world for a year, starting with only a small wardrobe and 5 in his pocket.

In this typical mid-Depression Era romantic comedy, uppercrust Bliss gets an education in how the working class lives. Along the way he also finds compassion for his fellow creature, becomes a better man himself, falls in love with a real sweety (Miss Brian) and wins his wager with the doctor.

He understands that people in spite of all uncertainties in life find happiness with what they have, and they care about another human being.
