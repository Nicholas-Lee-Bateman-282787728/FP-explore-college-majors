7880856,3,6304853149,"LOVE IN THE TIME OF TWILIGHT (1995) is a complicated but compelling blend of romance, comedy, ghost story and time-travel that manages to wring both tears and laughs out of the audience. In the capable hands of Hong Kong producer-director Tsui Hark, it's fast-paced, smoothly crafted and boasts some expert special effects in the depiction of ghostly antics and double exposures as the actors frequently play opposite themselves.
The plot is hard to summarize because there's so much going on and it happens so fast. A young man who works in a bank and a young woman who works at the Peking Opera in a bustling Chinese town at the turn of the century are looking for mates (along with dozens of other young singles) during an annual festival and continually cross paths, but instead of connecting, they keep antagonizing each other. When the man, Kong, is killed in a bank robbery, he appears as a ghost to the young woman, Yan Yan, two weeks later and manages to get her to go back in time with him to the day of the murder to try and change history. Things take a frenetic turn as the two keep running into their earlier selves and the now-dead robber's ghost shows up to conspire with his living self to thwart the couple. A horrible fate awaits the couple in an eerie afterlife if they fail.
This film was a follow-up to Hark's wildly successful THE LOVERS (1994), a remake of the Chinese classic, ""The Butterfly Lovers,"" which starred the same lead actor and actress as this film, Nicky Wu and Charlie Yeung. LOVE IN THE TIME OF TWILIGHT is more distinctly Chinese in flavor and less western-friendly than most of the Hong Kong films produced/directed over the last 20 years by Hark (famous for PEKING OPERA BLUES, ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA and CHINESE GHOST STORY). There's no magic or martial arts here, but there is a detailed Peking Opera background and a whole festival, complete with a set of rituals, devoted to finding a mate, or ""affinity,"" as the subtitles put it. It's definitely a unique entry in 1990s HK cinema and a risky endeavor on Hark's part, but a rewarding one for fans of the genre.",989539200,,2109,4.596816976127321
