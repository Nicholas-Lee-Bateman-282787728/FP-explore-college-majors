8645212,2,B00IT6I92I,"I bought this DVD hoping it was as advertised, a disaster movie about the possible end of the world.  Instead, I watched an excessively long dreary movie (87 minutes that felt like 6 hours) billed as a Bulgarian-Canadian co-production, about some science project that goes haywire.  Heavy on conspiracy, within the first few minutes an unknown character is done in by an umbrella.  Why?  A better question would be who cares?  The plot swirls around an ill-fated scheme to produce clean FREE energy.  The company behind this is aptly named Zero Point.  The man supposedly in charge of this project is Dr. Victor Susskind (played by Robin Dunne, one time co-star of the TV series Sanctuary).  He plays this role as though he's in a stupor, wishing he was somewhere else.  Unhappily, he isn't and we're stuck with his sourpuss moping for 87 minutes!  Time-time-time, it's all about time.  An atomic clock abruptly fails and so does this film.  Said doctor wakes up the next day to a gray world gone sad.  History has been rewritten.  Some people regain their memories, some don't, some are drugged into forgetting these 'false' memories (dubbed Memory Relapse Syndrome).  The rest of this lifeless flick falters between a conspiracy to retrieve an iPhone that hasn't been invented (yet), and the poor sap (Dunne) who can't seem to get his (new) life together, never mind surviving the daily super-tornadoes that are destroying the planet.  The dumbest scene involves torturing said sap for the whereabouts of the mystery phone........after first telling him to shut up.  You can't have it both ways, which pretty much explains this movie wanting to be a thriller and a sci-fi puzzle.  It ultimately ends up being neither.  Worse, when the BIG reveal is unveiled it turns out to be so rudimentarily simple that it's laughable.

This sci-fi flick failed to entertain me on any level.  It's definitely not a keeper.",1407110400,2,1910,4.924764890282131
