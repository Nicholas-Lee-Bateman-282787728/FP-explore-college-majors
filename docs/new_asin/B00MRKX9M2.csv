6600394,5,B00MRKX9M2,"This set of videos with change your life. I met and interviewed Les Blank a few years back. He was well named, an accomplished and independent filmmaker of wonderfully-personal films, he was the most boring interview I have ever done. His films tell it all. He anonymously filmed his subject and let them be themselves. He chose a few unique subjects; the warm loveable and full-of-life Cajuns, the unique bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins caught in his own community and family, Zydeco king Clifton Chenier, hippies in their original innocence, polka bands, Santaria drummers and Tex-Mex bands on the Northern Mexican border. In short these are historical and human people and musics that matter to roots music fans. You will find these people your best friends and introduce your friends to them. Of course Blanks obsessions for flowers and barbeque appear in nearly every film. Heck, he called his family Flower Films for a reason. Don't miss this collection especially at this bargain price (about 45% off). Don't think; buy this and then seek out Chulas Fronteras, J'ai to the Ball (?) and a few others. Go, buy and enjoy.",1432857600,,1120,4.962765957446808
6600395,5,B00MRKX9M2,"wow what a tremendous pleasure. a wonderful group of Les Blanks' Documentaries for your fun and amusement. these capture life in Louisiana in the 60's and 70's and the lives of two great texas bluesmen at the same time. cooking Cajun food, admiring different standards of beauty, and a bunch of other stuff. buy this and be fascinated by another time and place. a hippie love in  1967.",1427760000,,385,4.661764705882353
6600396,5,B00MRKX9M2,No one does documentaries like Les Blank.  Loved every one on this disk (e.g. Gapped Tooth Women) plus I got the bonus of watching Irma Thomas make Red Beans and Rice (there was a recipe included in the great booklet that accompanies this set). The New Orleans stuff alone is worth the purchase.,1427414400,7,295,4.566037735849057

6600398,5,B00MRKX9M2,"This is the best money that I have spent in quite a long time.  Les Blank's films are a treasure.  No phoniness or set-ups for the camera, he just films the beauty of every day life and treasured rituals of the wonderful and diverse folks that he met.  You can feel the love that he had for the simple people of the bayou, the Texas plains, and everywhere else that he traveled.  Anyone wishing to see America, it's roots, and some off the beaten path individuals should not hesitate to see Les' films.  Very human and for me, very spiritual as well.  Thank you Criterion!",1423267200,12,572,4.4
6600399,5,B00MRKX9M2,"This is a masterful compilation of restored films by the great documentary filmmaker Les Blank, who died in 2013. I love Les' films for their way of immersing the viewer into interesting ethnic subcultures. His films have no narration; he lets his subjects reveal themselves.  Lots of music, food, dancing and living.  I'm delighted to have this collection on Blu-Ray with great picture and sound. Highly recommended!",1419724800,8,417,5.208955223880597

God Respects Us When We Work, but Loves Us When We Dance (1968 * 20 mins * Color * Monaural * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
Blank took his camera to the historic 1967 Easter Sunday love-in in Los Angeles for this immersive, even spiritual collage of a film.

Spend It All (1971 * 43 mins * Color * Monaural * In English and French with English subtitles * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
Blank journeys down the bayous and byways of Southwest Louisiana in this riveting portrait of the region's Cajun community.

A Well Spent Life (1971 * 44 mins * Color * Monaural * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
Musician Mance Lipscomb commands the screen in Blank's vivid sketch of a man some consider the greatest blues guitarist who ever lived.

Dry Wood (1973 * 37 mins * Color * Monaural * In English and French with English subtitles * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
Blank ventured back to Southwest Louisiana for this work of ramshackle beauty, an immersion in the region's black Creole community that teems with delightful detail.

This is an energetic portrait of the Grammy-winning Creole musician Clifton Chenier, a.k.a. the King of Zydeco; Blank beautifully captures his music's propulsive, foot-tapping joy.

Always for Pleasure (1978 * 57 mins * Color * Monaural * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
Blank's raucous tribute to the sights, sounds, and flavors of New Orleans is perhaps his most sustained representation of pure joy.

Garlic Is as Good as Ten Mothers (1980 * 50 mins * Color * Monaural * In English and Spanish with English subtitles * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
More than just a nonfiction lark, Blank's highly personal film ode to the ""stinking rose"" is a loving tribute both to a food that unites the most disparate of cuisines and to the East Bay, California, community that appears on-screen.

Sprout Wings and Fly (1983 * 30 mins * Color * Monaural * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
This is a warm depiction of the life of old-time fiddler Tommy Jarrell in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.

In Heaven There Is No Beer? (1984 * 49 mins * Color * Monaural * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)

Blank breezily questions our commonly accepted standards of beauty with this paean to women with extra-wide dental spaces.

Sworn to the Drum: A Tribute to Francisco Aguabella (1995 * 34 mins * Color * Stereo * In English and Spanish with English subtitles * 1.33:1 aspect ratio)
The impassioned rhythms of Francisco Aguabella's conga propel this portrait of the great Afro-Cuban percussionist.

8674354,4,B00MRKX9M2,"Great little movies, giving a special view on Luisiana's history. And - for the age of the movies - good colors and sound. Lot's of new surrounding materials, interviews etc. Sometimes it gives more background, but basically it is just add-on material.

Unfortunately the Blu-ray is US coded and does not run in Europe, which is not mentioned anywhere - therefore 1 star less.",1467763200,,376,4.875
8674355,4,B00MRKX9M2,"Criterion should include subtitle in different languages considering all the the work the put in restoration, extras, etc.",1466380800,,122,5.833333333333333
8674356,5,B00MRKX9M2,"An absolutely terrific set from Criterion, with 14 (!) films from one of America's most humanist documentarians.  Blank makes idiosyncratic, often funny and delightful films that celebrate people, places and traditions, and does so with no pretense of 'objectivity', just his personal need to share things he loves (top of the list - music and food).  They're all under an hour, and while easily digested, they also hold up well to repeated viewings.

My favorite (I'm a blues fan) may be the earliest in the set; The Blues Accordin' to Lightnin' Hopkins (1968). This early 31 minute film captures whats terrific about Blanks style.  The love and admiration he feels for his subjects, his willingness not to sugar coat the dark sides (like Hopkins drinking), and the embrace of music and food as exemplars of the joys of existence.  Its hard not to smile watching Blanks work.  The home-spun approach to his film-making  hand drawn titles, an avoidance of anything slick or fancy in his style, no narrator to create distance, makes it feel like you're watching a friends home movies about a subject they're really excited about.  But the art lies in the fact that these home movies uncannily capture people, places and whole cultures with an immediacy and vibrancy that too few documentaries have.  I also like that Blank makes his films just as long as he feels they needs to be, without worry.  If that means one film is 20 minutes and another 180, that won't bother him.  Blank is following his gut, with no look to how its supposed to be done.  By the end of this film, I wanted to run and buy a stack of Lightnin Hopkins recordings.  Thats a pretty good endorsement.

The blu-ray presentation is excellent, but keep in mind most of these films were shot on 16mm, with no budget, so all the inherent limitations of that are part of the charms of the films.  And if all that's not enough, there are the usual Criterion ton of extras; interviews, outtakes, etc for many of the films, and an intelligent, well written booklet as well.  A great set.",1457395200,5,2049,4.697478991596639

You can watch most of these films on Hulu, but this package is not only beautiful to hold, but almost every film has outtakes, interviews, and related material. Even the DVD navigation shows a wonderful attention to detail.

The films of Les Blank and Maureen Gosling have been reaching wider audiences in festivals in recent years, and this collection can only help that positive trend.  'Les Blank:  Always for Pleasure' would be better titled 'Les & Maureen:  Always for Pleasure' -- Maureen Gosling co-directs and/or edits nearly all of these films and her creative stamp is very much part of the texture of these films.",1440374400,2,468,4.886075949367089
