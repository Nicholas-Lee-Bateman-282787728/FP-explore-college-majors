3986124,2,B002TSIDAA,"This was described as a cutting edge sort of CSI --- with paranormal and scientific cutting edge themes --- the opposite is the truth --- I watched one disc and put it into my ""stupid"" pile...  It is not even comparable to CSI --- I thought, from the way the description of this show was given, that it would be something akin to The Fringe --- which I think is really great.  But this show is very adequate only --- if you have to watch something, you can stick this into your player and take a nap...",1269388800,2,502,4.164948453608248
3986125,5,B002TSIDAA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series on CBS.  I was thrilled when I was notified that I could purchase it. Then it turned out that Amason didn't have it and I had to purchase it form another sellers link through Amazon.
The show was totally believable in this day and age, and CBS cancels another one.
The show had interesting cases each week. The development of the friendship between Rachel(the FBI Agent) and Jason Hood(the FBI Asset) was an enjoyable process to watch from being resentful of the assignment, to realizing that she couldn't have had a better assignment was interest.  The addition of Agent Lee seemed to make the team.

Eleventh Hour rivaled CSI for hard-hitting, edge-of-your-seat drama, while the smaller, more intimate cast had a chemistry more intense than any found in a laboratory.

It is a measure of Sewell's talent that, in spite of the character's eccentricities,he still emerges as a strong and sympathetic character.

3986161,5,B002TSIDAA,"This was a great show. It was fantasy but interesting.

 I've been hoping for years it would be released but I don't understand why it's so expensive. Other shows are only $30-$35 for a whole season. This is a ridiculous price and the company is certainly losing money because most people in today's economy can't afford $50+ to spend on one season of an old TV show.

If you can afford it, it's a great addition for anybody who collects old tv shows and likes this type of genre",1332892800,3,479,4.359550561797753
3986162,4,B002TSIDAA,"I'm a huge Rufus Sewell fan but I digress, this is a very good show. It may not be exactly, scientifically accurate but all of you who aren't die-hard scientists will enjoy it very much. The first episode premiered in October 2008 and the last aired in April 2009.
The extremely smart Doctor Hood (Sewell) is a widow who was hired by the FBI to investigate scientific crimes. He dumbs down the scientific conondrums of each episode in a nice way and his character is very humble. Don't think that this show is only for the uber-smart, there is lots of action too! With his FBI partner (Marley Shelton), the two chase down bad guys, save victims, and solve crimes. Some topics to get you even more interested include cloning, savant-ism, and frozen bodies in sunny California. This first and only season (the show should have had multiple!) has 18 episodes on 6 disks! I highly suggest that if you're contemplating this buy, get it!",1325721600,8,931,4.648484848484848
3986163,2,B002TSIDAA,The series is formulaic and not very compelling.  I adore Rufus Sewell and that's why I bought it.  Don't recommend unless you are a Sewell fan.,1323820800,4,144,4.5
3986164,5,B002TSIDAA,"This smart TV series featured British heart-throb Rufus Sewell (""Middlemarch,"" ""Woodlanders,"" ""Dark City,"" Pillars of the Earth,"" ""Dangerous Beauty,"" ""Helen of  Troy"") as Dr. Jacob Hood, a genius scientist called on by the FBI to help solve its most baffling cases.  It was apparently based on a British series of the same name which starred Patrick Stewart.  Because of constant danger he was assigned an FBI ""handler,"" a petit blonde who could kick serious butt.  Their chemistry mostly consisted of the great respect they had for each other.  All 18 episodes had something unique to recommend them.  You could say this series made science sexy.  One can hope that in a year or two, CBS will ask Sewell back for another run.  Until then we can make do with this boxed set.",1323475200,5,774,4.8106060606060606
3986165,5,B002TSIDAA,"You already know what this show is about, so I won't waste your time going over what has already been written.  Let's just say that Rufus Sewell and Marley Shelton had great chemistry, the stories were well written and the technical stuff, which I don't pay any atttention to, must have been well done as I saw no flaws in any episode and I watched them all.  However, like so many good shows, the networks get greedy and would rather feed us reality shows.  As for me, give me a show like this one or Fringe, Moonlight (which died of course) or bring back The Gates (which also died), which I really liked, anything but more reality crap.

However, as much I like this show, it is over-priced at $48 and up.  It would be a buy at $25-$30. Or maybe you could just stream it, if you haven't seen it.",1319673600,4,798,4.258278145695364

While I understand that it is manufactured on demand, I KNOW that creating one box set does not cost $50.

3986171,3,B002TSIDAA,"I absolutely loved The Eleventh Hour, the 2006 BBC production, and was very disappointed the series ended with only four episodes. I was glad to see CBS picked up the storyline starring Rufus Sewell (who I also admire), and purchased this DVD set expecting very similar stories. Sadly, I never learn to curb my enthusiasm and ""test run"" a TV series by viewing a bit of it through my mail order DVD rental program, and now I am stuck with a pricey DVD set that I will only watch once. The original British series was written as based on science-fact, positing stories of deep ethical choices, powerful personal motives, or seriously unethical interests grown from power and money. I even learned a tidbit about Hans Geiger and his work with the Nazi's. Each of the four stories were entirely believable, however fictional the premise. In hind sight, I must admit the 90-minute format of the British series allowed for more depth, intrigue, and development than a forty-four minute American sprint to a climax. The American series made a number of mistakes, the most egregious for me being the copying of original scripts. If one spends millions on a new series, I would hope one has enough money to pay for a new story and not copy-cat (not once but twice!) the creativity of our English cousins. I was hoping that the characters, Ian Hood in England and Jacob Hood in America, would be related, perhaps as father and son, allowing for more developed story line and even a bit of cameo by Patrick Stewart (Ian Hood). But no, that kind of barrowing of story line from Britain is not seen as a creative enhancement, we only copy complete scripts. Finally, in one American episode, we see Jacob (Rufus Sewell) replying to a TV broadcast of commercial advertising with the line, ""Lies""; he changes the station, views another commercial and says of it, ""Lies!"" He endeared himself to me with that moment. Yet, in the following episode, Jacob Hood saves the day for all by inventing a chimarized gene therapy in a matter of hours, using a simple, unsophisticated, college science laboratory. I want to know how I, too, can perform a polymerase chain reaction with a bit of glass and a Bunsen burner. He then injects a suffering youth with his concoction without any test or study, committing the same act of seriously unethical medical practice that originally placed the suffering youth in jeopardy. Say again, ""Lies!"" (The youth, by the way, is trapped for at least a day in a Coast Guard decompression chamber to control the biological reaction that would otherwise kill him and I kept asking dumb questions like, ""Where's the toilet?"" (in that chamber?).) This is not science fact; the American version is very much science fiction in its full implausibility. Anyone want to by this series at reduced cost? I've got one.",1284768000,9,2817,4.786447638603696
3986172,4,B002TSIDAA,"I first saw this series when it came out in 2008.  The series' humanness and storylines made me want to see the original miniseries it was based on.
While there are some similar stories (Resurrection, Containment), the treatments are very different and both the screenwriting and chemistry in Jerry Bruckheimer's adaptation are far superior. It appeals to both the nerds who geek after the science and the jocks who are looking for a bit of action, and there's always the story.
That one could make today's science both interesting and suspenseful in a limited format with only two lead characters, pre-Fringe which is really far out there and beyond real, made me wish that there were more seasons than just the single one.
Rufus Sewell and Marley Shelton have more than enough chemistry in their working relationship to have made this take off to reaches unknown. Special Agent Rachel Young has her hands full handling Dr. Jacob Hood as the Special Science Advisor to the FBI, a bio-physicist who tackles the strange and unexplained. There is more drama than sci-fi here which makes this a hard fit into today's TV which probably led to its demise; very different from the X-files and definitely not Fringe.",1284336000,7,1209,4.897560975609756

In my humble opinion, he is very handsome (read: hottie) and I just wanted to look at him.  Turns out the series itself is really quite good.  Best way to describe it for me is forensic science.  The main character, Jacob Hood, is a scientist working with the FBI on unusual cases,  He is intelligent almost to the point of being barmy, but is so engaging (and good looking) with a quirky sense of humor.  His interaction with his FBI handler, Rachel Cook, is appealing and the cases they are assigned are very intense.  This set includes six discs with three episodes each.

I have a scientific background, and I found that the science bits were mostly accurate (and considering that the series was made 8-9 years ago, pretty prescient). There were simplifications, but I expect that with a format to fit an hour show (leaving room for the ads). Both principal parts are well acted. It was clear that someone felt that there needed to be more humor and so Felix was added into the mix in the later shows.
