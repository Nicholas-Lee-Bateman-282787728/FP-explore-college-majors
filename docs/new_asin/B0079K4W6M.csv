5066798,4,B0079K4W6M,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released for sometime now. I finally saw it listed in my Comcast On Demand section. There is a brief interview with Brittany Snow and the always amazing Evan Ross. Evan first arrived on the scene in an unforgettable performance as Ant in ""ATL"". He stars as the younger brother to hip hop artist T.I. If you haven't seen this movie, it is entertaining and seems to be in perpetual re-runs on either VH1, MTV, BET or TVONE. That was 5 years ago. Since then Evan has burnt up the screen in a slew of indie movies from my favorite, though quite disturbing, ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" and last summer's acclaimed, ""Moo-zu-lum"".

His performance as Dre in ""96 Minutes"" is as intense as both the aforementioned ""Life is Hot in Cracktown"" (currently airing on the Starz channel) and ""Moozulum"". It is gripping and demanding.",1333065600,,857,4.601307189542483
5066799,4,B0079K4W6M,"""I never should have gotten out of bed this morning."" Carley (Snow) is about to graduate from college and her father isn't interested in attending. Lena (Serratos) just found out that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Dre (Ross) just found out that he will be able to graduate high school and finally has found a way out of gang life. Kevin (Trautmann) wants nothing more then to join a gang. When him and Dre get into an argument that ends up in carjacking the car that belongs to Carley with Lena has a passenger. The best way to describe this is ""Crash"" with teens. Total strangers who are all connected by one event that threatens to ruin all of them. This is very moving, powerful and intense. I highly recommend this one but much like ""Crash"" it's not really one you can watch over and over. The acting is great and the movie is a mix of flashbacks and current events that really make you feel connected to the characters and find your self sad and angry all at once. Overall, a surprisingly good movie that deserves to be watched. I give it a B+",1332806400,3,1052,4.372448979591836
5066839,5,B0079K4W6M,Amazing movie! I never would have thought this movie would be so good! Must see from beginning to end! Stumbled on this movie and absolutely love it!!!,1375142400,,151,4.62962962962963
5066840,2,B0079K4W6M,Same tired garbage that's been written a thousand times. Smart kid lives in slums but is on his way to better days through education. Has friends who eventually ruin his life. Jonathan Michael Trautmann really needs to take more acting lessons.,1367193600,,244,4.975609756097561
5066841,3,B0079K4W6M,"Written and directed by Aimee Lagos (her feature debut), ""96 Minutes"" unfolds like a smaller scaled version of ""Crash,"" Paul Haggis's acclaimed drama with a multi-layered story about the people from various social backgrounds.

Without revealing much about the story, I can say in ""96 Minutes"" two separate stories about four young people Dre (Evan Ross), Kevin (Jonathan Michael Trautmann), Carley (Brittany Snow) and Lena (Christian Serratos), told in an interwoven narrative, converge as they all involved in one carjacking on a fateful night, either as victims or perpetrators.

Acting is solid and photography is realistic, but the narrative shifts back and forth in time more than necessary. The film feels far too calculated, lessening its emotional impact considerably. There is some suspense built up as to what he or she will do next, but the suspense doesn't have much to do with the narrative device the film employs.

What is the most disappointing is the characters that are little better than stereotypes. Moreover, we know what happens to one of the character (lying soaked in blood) in the film's opening five minutes. Considering the fine acting from the cast, ""96 Minutes"" would have been more effective with a conventional narrative style.",1363824000,,1259,5.2227722772277225
5066842,4,B0079K4W6M,"96 Minutes is the story of 4 young people whose lives collide during the course of a carjacking. The acting was top notch and compelling. The story did a great job illustrating the lives of young, poor urban males and why they start off way behind the 8 ball. It comes as no surprise that so many kids growing up in poverty end up in trouble with the law from a very early age.

Anyone who assumes that racism has been eliminated ought to take the time to watch this movie. People of color in urban areas learn young that the deck is stacked against them - the police are not there to protect OR serve them. Most of the people they know &/or love end up dead or in prison before the age of 21. Many young males choose gangs over a community that seems to be very much about exclusion.

Violent acts compel me to ask why. This movie makes a good attempt at bringing these 4 characters to life. I liked knowing the carjackers as real people rather than repulsive, two dimensional monsters cut from boiler plate.

The great thing about films like 96 Minutes is that they lead to reflection. What does it means to be human? Is the failure to stop a murder morally the same as pulling the trigger? Can there  be redemption after a terrible act committed at such a young age? Most movies about crime are written to produce the same reaction: rage. We seldom get to peer beyond that to look at a crime from all angles.",1358380800,,1411,4.293233082706767
5066843,4,B0079K4W6M,i bought this movie because my cousin Jason Park acts in it. he did an awesome job. I didn't give the movie 5 stars because i did not like the ending. but other then that the movie was alright.,1357603200,,193,3.9743589743589745
5066844,3,B0079K4W6M,"Acting was genuine and believable, but its simply a recount of the same old story of halfway good person make bad choices.",1354406400,,122,4.590909090909091

5066846,3,B0079K4W6M,"This movie was just ""o.k"" for me . It wasn't a complete waste of time but isn't going to win any academy awards anytime soon.",1343865600,,125,4.04
5066847,4,B0079K4W6M,"Very good movie, good script, good actors & of course Brittany Snow who has been acting for quite a while did a fantastic job as well as Evan Ross who also did a fantastic job. I have absolutely loved Evan Ross every since I saw him in ATL where he did such a great job, then I saw him in Mooz-lum and he just keeps getting better & better.  I know his mother the legendary Diana Ross who acted her behind off in the 1st breakthrough black movie, ""Lady Sings the Blues"" where the black cast was classy & had dignified roles is beyond proud of her son as well as her daughter Tracey who is also an actor. I'm pretty sure Diana is giving them some great acting tips because they are doing their thing, especially that Evan who is absolutely shining like a big, bright star on the big & small screen & he is definitely amazing & shining like a star in this movie.",1337212800,,860,4.149700598802395
5066848,4,B0079K4W6M,"The movie opens with a night time scene of 4 youths riding in a car looking for a hospital because one of the girls is shot in the face. The shooter is also in the car and doesn't want to go to jail. We then flash back to the separate lives of the 4 individuals, in far too typical indie fashion, to see what they were doing that day and how their lives came together.

Carley (Brittany Snow) is a pre-law student who has father issues. She is a driver and wants to graduate with honors. Lena (Christian Serratos) has decided to leave her uncaring boyfriend Michael (Adam Trahan). Dre (Evan Ross) is in college and an escapee from a bad neighborhood. He thinks of himself as being part of the gang, when really he is a good kid. Kevin (Jonathan Michael Trautmann) is a white boy with an abusive home life. He will do anything to join a gang.

The film has good acting and a decent plot. The production seems to be aimed at helping would-be gangstas who are still in school and not old white guys like me.  If you like the indie style, give it a view.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1335657600,7,1078,4.218446601941747
