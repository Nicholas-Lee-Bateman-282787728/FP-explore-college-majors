3049210,5,B0010KHOSA,"Several years ago I watched ""Black widow"" on television, and loved it. And now, finally, it's on DVD! I can't wait to enjoy this movie again.",1203811200,4,141,4.461538461538462
3049211,2,B0010KHOSA,"This technicolour wide screen murder mystery is an overproduced, overdressed, artificial talk fest. The plot, involving the murder of an ambitious young stage actress in the New York Theatre, combines elements of ""All About Eve"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Stage Fright"". Nunnally Johnson, one of 20th Century Fox's most prolific writers, took over directing duties and his direction is dismal. The film, unfolding like a stage play, is static and the murderer is obvious. The film is a bit like an episode of Perry Mason without the vitality (and Mason was not known for vitality)!

A primary problem is the atrocious over-acting of Ginger Rogers (Bette Davis in ""All About Eve"") who was never worse than here. Rogers plays a ""great"" theatre actress but on this evidence, that would be impossible. Peggy Anne Garner (Anne Baxter in ABE) as her understudy and Reginald Gardiner (Gary Merrill) as her weak husband are not much better. George Raft is his usual wooden self as the cop but Van Heflin (Hugh Marlowe) who writes for the theatre is very good and Gene Tierney (Celeste Holm) is low key and charming as his wife. The comparisons to ""All About Eve"" demonstrate just how poor this film is. This was one of a number of films which 20th Century Fox produced in the mid fifties to capitalise on the wide screen process. In an intimate drama like this, the process was unsuitable as the audience scanned the screen to see all the cast. This contributed to the feeling that you were watching a stage play. By the way, the packaging classifies this film as ""Film Noir"" - no way.

It should be noted though that the print is excellent and the DVD contains a few extras including short documentaries on Rogers and Tierney which are OK.",1198368000,27,1729,4.76
3049212,4,B0010KHOSA,"""Black Widow"" is an entertaining 1950s murder mystery set in the world of theatre, and written and directed by Nunnally Johnson, who made a number of good movies at that time (""How to Marry a Millionaire,"" ""Night People,"" ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" ""The Three Faces of Eve"").  It stars Van Heflin, Gene Tierney, Ginger Rogers, George Raft, and Peggy Ann Garner as sort of the Eve Harrington of the cast.

(Amazon's habit of listing the cast alphabetically is very misleading.  Mabel Albertson has a small part, Reginald Gardiner plays Ginger Roger's husband.  But Harry Carter and Richard H. Cutting play policeman, listed on imdb.com, but they are also ""uncredited"" in the film!  So it's totally misleading to see those names at the top of the page.)  (Note: this complaint has been corrected on this page, but I decided to leave it because I do note the same issue in other listings, where unknown actors in tiny roles are listed because they're first in the alphabet.)

So that little parenthetical complaint aside, it's a small but fun film.  The milieu of theatre is entertaining, with Peggy Ann Garner someone on the way up (or hoping to be), and managing to hang out with successful writers and actors, and starting to seduce several of them.  Heflin is the serious husband/playwright and a bit of a patsy, Tierney is the ""good wife,"" and Ginger Rogers is fun as the grande dame actress who annoys everyone a bit.  Peggy Ann Garner was the little girl so good in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.""  This is one of her adult roles, and she does a good job.  It's not a classic, but an entertaining B film with some A list stars and some good dialogue from Mr. Johnson.  I'm glad it's going to be out on dvd.",1197331200,67,1715,4.583606557377049

""A black widow spider devours its mate."" Iris leaves on an airplane to visit her sick mother. Her husband goes to a party. Who are these people? Peter Denver meets a lonely woman, a writer. Nancy doesn't drink, but is hungry. [Are these the kind of people you would associate with?] They show scenes of New York city streets, uncluttered by automobiles. Greenwich Village had low rents. The story shows Miss Ordway's activities. Nancy sold her first story. [There was a market for fiction in the many magazines that were in business then.] The story runs on with other scenes. Iris returns. She gets a shock! The police investigate and question Peter Denver. What was her motive? Does Peter have an alibi? He was at a movie that afternoon. The police question the servants. One provided damaging testimony against Peter. Peter Denver complains about Miss Amberly's story. We learn more about it. A letter from Miss Ordway arrives! This causes problems. The police question Mr. Mullin about Peter Denver.

The Medical Examiner said it was murder, not a suicide. Mullin tells Peter Denver about this. ""Do you have a lawyer?"" Denver takes a powder. The police are searching for him! Denver questions Miss Amberly about her story from Miss Ordway. He goes to question an employee and learns new information about Miss Ordway. He goes to that address to question that gray-haired man. So do the police! Nancy said the affair started on June 2, before Peter met her. Mrs. Denver calls Lottie to talk. Her husband talks to Peter about his relationship and what happened. Nancy tells of her plans for blackmail Peter. There was a hidden microphone tat let the police listen in. If Mullin didn't do it, who did? Who had the motive and opportunity? Miss Marin speaks. She tells what she heard. There was a witness to Peter's presence at the theater at the time of death. We see what actually happened! Nancy is told to leave town, but refuses. There is an outburst of hate and emotion! The police have fingerprints on the suicide note. They know who did it. And do will you when you watch this movie.

This murder mystery documents Manhattan life in the late 1950s among show business people. Some parts seem implausible, such as strangling a victim then hanging the body from a rope.",1376352000,,2298,4.768844221105527

3049239,3,B0010KHOSA,"""Black Widow"" is billed on DVD as a Fox Film Noir. However, the noir term refers to the mystery since this was a garish-hued CinemaScope production written and directed by Nunnally Johnson, one of the South's more famous sons who became a prolific golden era Hollywood writer-producer-director.  This one of those ""New York upper crust"" stories in which a famous Broadway producer is accused of seducing and murdering a young wannabe writer, then hanging her in his and his wife's bedroom to make it appear a suicide. Oh, yes, there is a note. Or is it? Van Heflin plays the producer on the run. Gene Tierney is his wife. Top-billed Ginger Rogers is the producer's current star and upstairs neighbor. He long-suffering hubby is Reginald Gardiner. George Raft portrays the homicide detective investigating the case. By the way this motion picture produced and released in 1954 and back on those days stories were allowed to have a real beginning, middle and end. So you have time to get to know who these people are and form your own opinions as the mystery onion is peeled a layer at a time. The victim in this big budget melodrama-mystery is Peggy Ann Garner whose career mostly consisted of goody-two-shoes characters, so it looks mighty bad for Van Heflin as he eludes capture trying to find out who done it. I gave it three stars mainly because, to me, the eye-popping color and loss of intimacy via CinemaScope was distracting. But mystery is well-done, which is a plus.",1357689600,3,1475,4.784313725490196

3049241,2,B0010KHOSA,"No question the draw of crime noir for this reviewer is the great black and white photography and the shadowy effects that medium has on heightening the drama of a film, especially films set in big grimy, hard-boiled cities like New York where the seamy side is hard to draw in unless you use such technique. And in the end that is what kind of does in this Technicolor film under review, Black Widow. Many of the actors, Gene Tierney, Van Heflin and George Raft in particular, cut their teeth on noir but here much of that skill goes to waste along with some soapy and indifferent dialogue that is calculated to make true aficionados of the genre weep.

That said, the plot line here and the mis-directions away from the real killer are actually not too bad. Writer Van Heflin unwittingly takes a budding Podunk girl, a budding Podunk writer gal, just freshly arrived in the big city under his wing. She is no fading violet though when it comes to moving her own career along. Unfortunately she has an affair and becomes, oh no, pregnant with an older man, an older married man whose actor wife (played by Ginger Rodgers) is, well, to be kind a bitch on wheels. Especially to those who try to take her ""kept"" husband away. Needless to say old Brother Heflin has to move heaven and earth to get out from under the ""frame"" someone has gone to great lengths to place around his poor writers head. Including sowing doubts in the head of his actor wife (played in kind of a syrupy way by Gene Tierney. She is no Laura here.). The plot line however cannot make up for that 1950s ""color"" that makes this one a wash.",1332201600,3,1609,4.4358108108108105
3049242,3,B0010KHOSA,"Purchased this for Gene Tierney's part. Bit disappointed in her role - not very inspiring. Story was okay - would have been interested to see what A. Hitchcock could have made of this. Worth viewing, but not 'a classic' by any means.",1326844800,2,233,4.571428571428571
3049243,4,B0010KHOSA,"About 15 minutes into this movie I was saying to myself, ""This is absolutely no a noir movie, with the lush technicolor and infamous voiceover of many 1950s movies, but about halfway in it did finally turn into a noir like story with the main character (Van Heflin) on the run throughout New York for a murder he did not commit.
This would would have been much more effective in Black & White and whoever thought Ginger Rogers could have such an ugly character !
The radiant Gene Tierney was really wasted here as the passive loyal wife of Heflins character.",1293062400,,558,4.534653465346534

3049245,2,B0010KHOSA,"I don't usually review movies here, but I felt ripped off by the marketing of this film.  If' I'd known what it was I'd never have bought or watched it. Other reviewers are correct; it's a huge stretch to call this film noir.

Nevertheless, the plot, derivative as it may be, is actually strong enough to keep you watching. I don't find anything wrong with Ginger Rogers' acting nor that of anyone else in this film.  Unlike a couple of other reviewers, I found the direction itself quite well paced and adequate. The gaudy cinematography, the high class arty studio sets were done well, if you accept those for what they are.

Other than being falsely advertised, what's the problem? The script, with it's relentless irritating attempts at sophisticated chatter, completely sinks this movie. Someone got paid to write these lines? It's beyond me how anyone, from the 1950s right up to today, could think that this trashy childish attempt at clever banter was any good.  The lines given to Ginger Roger's character are the worst.  She's supposed to be so classy, so nasty, so clever, and every single sentence that comes out of her mouth is jaw-droppingly dopey.  Anyone who actually said these things would need to be immediately evaluated for a head injury.

I don't believe I've ever seen a movie of any genre that has less character development than this one.  From the first line each character utters we are being signaled about the stereotype.  All the rest of the lines only serve to reinforce that one-dimensional assignment--in case we forgot from 30 seconds earlier.  The 50's style, the expensive costumes, and the decor all add to this problem; it's just phony people, in phony apartments, in front of phony backdrops.  It quickly stops mattering that the backdrops are well drawn or that the costumes are beautiful.

I've never completely understood why so many films from this era got so out of balance--crammed full of synthetic visual style, but also crammed full of superficial characters.  This particular one however takes the cake--was this some clods idea of camp?",1283558400,8,2086,4.905982905982906
3049246,4,B0010KHOSA,"The answer to that header is ""not much"".  With his wife (Gene Tierney) out of town, Broadway big shot Van Heflin allows a struggling young female writer to use his apartment during the daytime. No good deed goes unpunished and the rule makes no exception for Heflin! The young lady, Peggy Ann Garner (""A Tree grows in Brooklyn"") is found hanged. The investigating NYPD detective, a perfectly cast George Raft, swarms over the cast. Though VH is the lead suspect, there are other possible perps too. A good review would never reveal a resolution, but the finger of culpability points sundry ways until the guilty party emerges. Present day defense attorneys may cringe at some of GR's ""evidence gathering"" techniques. Previous reviews have mentioned the incongruous use of Cinemascope in BW. Also, the staging here reminds one of a play, with constantly changing scenes and sophisticated dialog.  Neither of those bothered this reviewer; they may even sharpen viewer attention.  BW is a slick, glossy production-too much so to be classified as ""noir"". It remains a first rate whodunit with interest maintained throughout. BW also gives viewers an opportunity to enjoy Ms. Rogers and Ms. Tierney in latter day roles but while they were still very attractive women.",1265241600,2,1262,5.086956521739131
3049247,4,B0010KHOSA,"Not exactly a noir, more like a murder-mystery twist on ""All About Eve"", Nunnally Johnson's BLACK WIDOW--strikingly filmed in CinemaScope and Deluxe Color--is an absorbing and highly entertaining little movie.

Would-be writer Nancy Ordway (Peggy Ann Garner) arrives in New York and proceeds to take advantage of anyone with a spare room and a smile.  The latest 'victim' in Nancy's quest to take on the big city is Broadway producer Peter Denver (Van Heflin), whilst his wife Iris (Gene Tierney) is out of town tending to her sick mother.  Could Nancy possibly use the Denver apartment during the daytime to help her in writing?  Peter has no problem with that arrangement...until the day he arrives home to find Nancy hanging from the rafters.

What starts out as a simple cut-and-dry suicide soon enough dissolves into a first degree murder case - with Peter as the main suspect.  On the run from the detectives, Peter and Iris must work fast to discover the ghastly truth...

Starring Ginger Rogers as the imperious theatre diva Carlotta Marin, BLACK WIDOW (1954) will appeal to those who like their murder mysteries served up with a healthy side order of snappy one-liners and outrageous costumes.  Peggy Ann Garner's role as the Eve Harrington-esque writer was one of her first attempts to make the often difficult transition from acclaimed child star (""Jane Eyre"", ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"") to sophisticated young adult, and I believe she does it very successfully in this movie.  The role of Nancy had originally been intended for Maggie McNamara (""Three Coins in the Fountain"") who fell ill shortly before filming was due to begin.

Also keep an eye out for Virginia Leith (""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"") playing one of Nancy's accommodating girlfriends, Cathleen Nesbitt as an upstairs maid, and Bea Benaderet (""Petticoat Junction"") as one of the guests at Carlotta's cocktail party.

I do find it very curious that Fox has seen fit to package this title as part of their Film Noir series, because apart from some noir actors like Gene Tierney and Van Heflin, BLACK WIDOW doesn't follow the standard noir genre trends at all.  Still I'm very glad that BLACK WIDOW is now readily available in a particularly lush widescreen print; and it's one of my favourite movies at the moment.

The DVD has two worthwhile featurettes focusing on Ginger Rogers and Gene Tierney, an informative commentary track by movie historian/author Alan Rode; interactive pressbook and picture galleries, isolated musical score track, and the theatrical trailer; plus trailers from other titles in the Fox Film Noir collection (""Daisy Kenyon"", ""Dangerous Crossing"", ""I Wake Up Screaming"" and ""Vicki"").",1248566400,2,2687,5.093394077448747
3049248,1,B0010KHOSA,"Where to begin with truly awful movie?  Ginger Rogers is just terrible.  Her performance was so bad I laughed out loud just about anytime she opened her mouth.  Sometimes I laughed out loud even when she wasn't speaking.  Her ""work"" in this movie would be justification alone for the Academy to demand the return of the Oscar they gave her for Kitty Foyle.  That she won that Oscar over Joan Fontaine (Rebecca) and Katharine Hepburn (The Philadelphia Story) was crime enough, but this performance is just plain embarrassing.  The movie looks like a filmed play with awkward stage movements and stilted dialogue that is cringe-worthy.  Ginger takes the worst acting honors but George Raft tries his best to outdo her in that department.",1244073600,4,735,4.926829268292683

3049252,3,B0010KHOSA,"Its really difficult to hate any film with a stellar cast such as Ginger Rogers, Gene Tierney, George Raft and Van Heflin.  For that matters, its difficult to hate any of their individual films.  Bring them together for one picture and ""hate"" might be a strong word, but ""indifferent"" fits the bill.  ""Black Widow"" feels more like a Cinemascope experiment than a cohesive and engaging film.  Cinemascope was brand spanking new and you could tell that 20th Century Fox was attempting to churn out as much product as possible in every genre possible.  No matter if the material was particularly engaging or the scripts particularly good, the studio seemed to think the public would embrace anything that was spread out on the Cinemascope canvas.  ""Black Widow"" is testament to this.  At 94 minutes there is very little here other than a scenery chewing performance by Ginger Rogers, an understated and misused Gene Tierney and a campy story line that can't quite find its footing, even after its predictable conclusion.  What does it have going for it?  Lush cinematography, gorgeous colors and excellent 1950s chic sets do a lot to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  Also, look out for an unusual Ginger Rogers role.  She plays against type which serves the plot beautifully.

The DVD of this film is really extra special with not one but two mini-docs about Ginger Rogers and Gene Tierney.  Also included is an isolated film score, an interactive pressbook, commentary and an ""over the top"" trailer that will leave you howling.  It is really an excellent group of extras.  The picture quality is truly luminous and the soundtrack is well spaced and exceptionally clear.

Tune in for the costumes, the hilarious over-the-top acting, and the stagey apartment sets all done in glorious color and Cinemascope as only Fox could do in the 50's.  Apparently someone at Fox thought this little potboiler deserved the same cinematographic treatment as ""Ben Hur""!

3049256,3,B0010KHOSA,"The year after the success of HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE Nunnally Johnson did another Cinemascope feature for Twentieth-Century Fox that this time featured two fabulous Manhattan swank and spacious apartments instead of just the one. Although BLACK WIDOW (the ill-fitting title is never explained) has been released for DVD as part of the Fox Noir series, there's almost nothing noir about it (except for one sequence, probably the best in the film, when the murder victim's hanged body is discovered); it's more of a melodramatic whodunit populated with many of Fox's slightly over-the-hill stars from the era, like Ginger Rogers, Gene Tierney, George Raft, and Van Heflin. The story (which like the direction is by Johnson) is extremely awkwardly constructed, and involves a very young writer (Peggy Ann Garner, giving the best performance in the film) whom Heflin takes into his life because of her apparent sweetness and naivete: only after she dies does he begin to see her story was much more complex than he had figured.

This is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle but Ginger Rogers, as a gossipy and catty theater diva, still dominates. She gives the part her all and is quite excellent in her final scenes, but she is almost singularly miscast in a part that was originally intended for Tallulah Bankhead.  There's not much competition from the other performers: Gene Tierney is almost completely wasted, Raft gives an annoying one-note performance, and Reginald Gardiner is even more hilariously miscast than Rogers. He's supposed to be her ""kept"" husband--a kind of boytoy--, even though he's over fifty, fancies ugly ascots and has about zero muscle tone in his entire body. The film's real star might be said to be not even Rogers but rather its elaborate color scheme of blues, lavenders, roses, and (especially) puce.",1211760000,7,1843,5.039344262295082

3049262,3,B0010KHOSA,"Three new film noirs and a weepy double feature---what more could you want for a late winter's evening (or evenings) entertainment? Some of the noirs are weepy, and some of the weepies are noirs, so it gets a little confusing. The one genuine, dyed-in-the-wool noir is 1953's Dangerous Crossing, coming in at a taught 76 minutes. Jeanne Crain plans to spend her honeymoon on a luxury liner with new hubby Carl Betz; problem is, hubby disappears within minutes of boarding, and all the signs point to him never existing. Kindly ship's doctor Michael Rennie straightens it all out, with a goodly number of thrills along the way. Black Widow is less successful a noir, despite the starry cast of Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney and George Raft. Set in the celebrity driven world of the New York theatre circa 1954,an ambitious young author uses her wiles to get ahead to little avail, as someone offs her halfway through the film, it's a whodunit that degenerates into a who cares. The main characters aren't drawn sharply enough, and the plot seems oddly discombobulated. With the exception of Heflin, the stars are somewhat past their prime and seem, unfortunately, a bit seedy However, Daisy Kenyon is the pick of the litter, despite it being squarely a Joan Crawford weepy rather than a noir. A love triangle with Crawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda deftly directed by Otto Preminger, one in a long line of her female leads making her way with pluck and honor in a man's world. It's black and white, it rains a lot, and there are some great atmospheric shots, but a film noir it ain't. There are also vintage scenes of mid-century Provincetown, and former Cape resident Ruth Warrick plays Andrew's beleaguered wife; despite Preminger's earlier great noirs such as Laura and Whirlpool, this really is a weepy.
The weepy double feature from Universal consists of Portrait in Black and Madame X, both starring Lana Turner and produced by that sultan of excess, Ross Hunter. Hunter's reality had little relationship to anyone else's; his was a world of the rich or near rich, beautiful or near beautiful, with lots of jewels and Jean Louis gowns, where there were no small emotions, only large, operatic, over-the-top scenes. Portrait in Black is a noir, albeit a noir in blazing color that his nothing to do with the low, cheap detective thrillers we all know and love. Turner and Anthony Quinn kill off her ailing husband Lloyd Nolan, and somebody knows their dirty little secret. Is it bubbly Sandra Dee, pert John Saxon, crusty Ray Walston or the ever mysterious Anna May Wong? And, as weepy par excellance, little can be said about Madame X, other than a profound and astonished, ""wow!"" Turner, as the poor but honest wife of super rich John Forsythe, is blackmailed by her evil mother-in-law, Constance Bennett, into leaving him and their baby, who, as he grows up to be Keir Dullea, might not be such a bad idea on the face of it. Later, Lana's accused of murder and her lawyer is---you guessed it---Dullea, who has no idea that he's defending his mom. You know, they simply are not making films like this any more.

3283708,2,B0010KHOSA,"This technicolour wide screen murder mystery is an overproduced, overdressed, artificial talk fest. The plot, involving the murder of an ambitious young stage actress in the New York Theatre, combines elements of ""All About Eve"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Stage Fright"". Nunnally Johnson, one of 20th Century Fox's most prolific writers, took over directing duties and his direction is dismal. The film, unfolding like a stage play, is static and the murderer is obvious. The film is a bit like an episode of Perry Mason without the vitality (and Mason was not known for vitality)!

A primary problem is the atrocious over-acting of Ginger Rogers (Bette Davis in ""All About Eve"") who was never worse than here. Rogers plays a ""great"" theatre actress but on this evidence, that would be impossible. Peggy Anne Garner (Anne Baxter in ABE) as her understudy and Reginald Gardiner (Gary Merrill) as her weak husband are not much better. George Raft is his usual wooden self as the cop but Van Heflin (Hugh Marlowe) who writes for the theatre is very good and Gene Tierney (Celeste Holm) is low key and charming as his wife. The comparisons to ""All About Eve"" demonstrate just how poor this film is. This was one of a number of films which 20th Century Fox produced in the mid fifties to capitalise on the wide screen process. In an intimate drama like this, the process was unsuitable as the audience scanned the screen to see all the cast. This contributed to the feeling that you were watching a stage play. By the way, the packaging classifies this film as ""Film Noir"" - no way.

It should be noted though that the print is excellent and the DVD contains a few extras including short documentaries on Rogers and Tierney which are OK.",1198368000,27,1729,4.76
3283709,4,B0010KHOSA,"""Black Widow"" is an entertaining 1950s murder mystery set in the world of theatre, and written and directed by Nunnally Johnson, who made a number of good movies at that time (""How to Marry a Millionaire,"" ""Night People,"" ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,"" ""The Three Faces of Eve"").  It stars Van Heflin, Gene Tierney, Ginger Rogers, George Raft, and Peggy Ann Garner as sort of the Eve Harrington of the cast.

(Amazon's habit of listing the cast alphabetically is very misleading.  Mabel Albertson has a small part, Reginald Gardiner plays Ginger Roger's husband.  But Harry Carter and Richard H. Cutting play policeman, listed on imdb.com, but they are also ""uncredited"" in the film!  So it's totally misleading to see those names at the top of the page.)  (Note: this complaint has been corrected on this page, but I decided to leave it because I do note the same issue in other listings, where unknown actors in tiny roles are listed because they're first in the alphabet.)

So that little parenthetical complaint aside, it's a small but fun film.  The milieu of theatre is entertaining, with Peggy Ann Garner someone on the way up (or hoping to be), and managing to hang out with successful writers and actors, and starting to seduce several of them.  Heflin is the serious husband/playwright and a bit of a patsy, Tierney is the ""good wife,"" and Ginger Rogers is fun as the grande dame actress who annoys everyone a bit.  Peggy Ann Garner was the little girl so good in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.""  This is one of her adult roles, and she does a good job.  It's not a classic, but an entertaining B film with some A list stars and some good dialogue from Mr. Johnson.  I'm glad it's going to be out on dvd.",1197331200,67,1715,4.583606557377049

Nancy doesn't drink, but is hungry. [Are these the kind of people you would associate with?] They show scenes of New York city streets, uncluttered by automobiles. Greenwich Village had low rents.

3283736,3,B0010KHOSA,"""Black Widow"" is billed on DVD as a Fox Film Noir. However, the noir term refers to the mystery since this was a garish-hued CinemaScope production written and directed by Nunnally Johnson, one of the South's more famous sons who became a prolific golden era Hollywood writer-producer-director.  This one of those ""New York upper crust"" stories in which a famous Broadway producer is accused of seducing and murdering a young wannabe writer, then hanging her in his and his wife's bedroom to make it appear a suicide. Oh, yes, there is a note. Or is it? Van Heflin plays the producer on the run. Gene Tierney is his wife. Top-billed Ginger Rogers is the producer's current star and upstairs neighbor. He long-suffering hubby is Reginald Gardiner. George Raft portrays the homicide detective investigating the case. By the way this motion picture produced and released in 1954 and back on those days stories were allowed to have a real beginning, middle and end. So you have time to get to know who these people are and form your own opinions as the mystery onion is peeled a layer at a time. The victim in this big budget melodrama-mystery is Peggy Ann Garner whose career mostly consisted of goody-two-shoes characters, so it looks mighty bad for Van Heflin as he eludes capture trying to find out who done it. I gave it three stars mainly because, to me, the eye-popping color and loss of intimacy via CinemaScope was distracting.

3283738,2,B0010KHOSA,"No question the draw of crime noir for this reviewer is the great black and white photography and the shadowy effects that medium has on heightening the drama of a film, especially films set in big grimy, hard-boiled cities like New York where the seamy side is hard to draw in unless you use such technique. And in the end that is what kind of does in this Technicolor film under review, Black Widow. Many of the actors, Gene Tierney, Van Heflin and George Raft in particular, cut their teeth on noir but here much of that skill goes to waste along with some soapy and indifferent dialogue that is calculated to make true aficionados of the genre weep.

That said, the plot line here and the mis-directions away from the real killer are actually not too bad. Writer Van Heflin unwittingly takes a budding Podunk girl, a budding Podunk writer gal, just freshly arrived in the big city under his wing. She is no fading violet though when it comes to moving her own career along. Unfortunately she has an affair and becomes, oh no, pregnant with an older man, an older married man whose actor wife (played by Ginger Rodgers) is, well, to be kind a bitch on wheels. Especially to those who try to take her ""kept"" husband away. Needless to say old Brother Heflin has to move heaven and earth to get out from under the ""frame"" someone has gone to great lengths to place around his poor writers head. Including sowing doubts in the head of his actor wife (played in kind of a syrupy way by Gene Tierney. She is no Laura here.).

3283742,2,B0010KHOSA,"I don't usually review movies here, but I felt ripped off by the marketing of this film.  If' I'd known what it was I'd never have bought or watched it. Other reviewers are correct; it's a huge stretch to call this film noir.

Nevertheless, the plot, derivative as it may be, is actually strong enough to keep you watching. I don't find anything wrong with Ginger Rogers' acting nor that of anyone else in this film.  Unlike a couple of other reviewers, I found the direction itself quite well paced and adequate. The gaudy cinematography, the high class arty studio sets were done well, if you accept those for what they are.

Other than being falsely advertised, what's the problem? The script, with it's relentless irritating attempts at sophisticated chatter, completely sinks this movie. Someone got paid to write these lines? It's beyond me how anyone, from the 1950s right up to today, could think that this trashy childish attempt at clever banter was any good.  The lines given to Ginger Roger's character are the worst.  She's supposed to be so classy, so nasty, so clever, and every single sentence that comes out of her mouth is jaw-droppingly dopey.  Anyone who actually said these things would need to be immediately evaluated for a head injury.

I don't believe I've ever seen a movie of any genre that has less character development than this one.  From the first line each character utters we are being signaled about the stereotype.  All the rest of the lines only serve to reinforce that one-dimensional assignment--in case we forgot from 30 seconds earlier.  The 50's style, the expensive costumes, and the decor all add to this problem; it's just phony people, in phony apartments, in front of phony backdrops.  It quickly stops mattering that the backdrops are well drawn or that the costumes are beautiful.

I've never completely understood why so many films from this era got so out of balance--crammed full of synthetic visual style, but also crammed full of superficial characters.  This particular one however takes the cake--was this some clods idea of camp?",1283558400,8,2086,4.905982905982906

No good deed goes unpunished and the rule makes no exception for Heflin! The young lady, Peggy Ann Garner (""A Tree grows in Brooklyn"") is found hanged. The investigating NYPD detective, a perfectly cast George Raft, swarms over the cast. Though VH is the lead suspect, there are other possible perps too. A good review would never reveal a resolution, but the finger of culpability points sundry ways until the guilty party emerges. Present day defense attorneys may cringe at some of GR's ""evidence gathering"" techniques. Previous reviews have mentioned the incongruous use of Cinemascope in BW. Also, the staging here reminds one of a play, with constantly changing scenes and sophisticated dialog.  Neither of those bothered this reviewer; they may even sharpen viewer attention.  BW is a slick, glossy production-too much so to be classified as ""noir"". It remains a first rate whodunit with interest maintained throughout. BW also gives viewers an opportunity to enjoy Ms. Rogers and Ms. Tierney in latter day roles but while they were still very attractive women.",1265241600,2,1262,5.086956521739131
3283744,4,B0010KHOSA,"Not exactly a noir, more like a murder-mystery twist on ""All About Eve"", Nunnally Johnson's BLACK WIDOW--strikingly filmed in CinemaScope and Deluxe Color--is an absorbing and highly entertaining little movie.

Would-be writer Nancy Ordway (Peggy Ann Garner) arrives in New York and proceeds to take advantage of anyone with a spare room and a smile.  The latest 'victim' in Nancy's quest to take on the big city is Broadway producer Peter Denver (Van Heflin), whilst his wife Iris (Gene Tierney) is out of town tending to her sick mother.  Could Nancy possibly use the Denver apartment during the daytime to help her in writing?  Peter has no problem with that arrangement...until the day he arrives home to find Nancy hanging from the rafters.

What starts out as a simple cut-and-dry suicide soon enough dissolves into a first degree murder case - with Peter as the main suspect.  On the run from the detectives, Peter and Iris must work fast to discover the ghastly truth...

Starring Ginger Rogers as the imperious theatre diva Carlotta Marin, BLACK WIDOW (1954) will appeal to those who like their murder mysteries served up with a healthy side order of snappy one-liners and outrageous costumes.  Peggy Ann Garner's role as the Eve Harrington-esque writer was one of her first attempts to make the often difficult transition from acclaimed child star (""Jane Eyre"", ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"") to sophisticated young adult, and I believe she does it very successfully in this movie.  The role of Nancy had originally been intended for Maggie McNamara (""Three Coins in the Fountain"") who fell ill shortly before filming was due to begin.

Also keep an eye out for Virginia Leith (""The Brain That Wouldn't Die"") playing one of Nancy's accommodating girlfriends, Cathleen Nesbitt as an upstairs maid, and Bea Benaderet (""Petticoat Junction"") as one of the guests at Carlotta's cocktail party.

I do find it very curious that Fox has seen fit to package this title as part of their Film Noir series, because apart from some noir actors like Gene Tierney and Van Heflin, BLACK WIDOW doesn't follow the standard noir genre trends at all.  Still I'm very glad that BLACK WIDOW is now readily available in a particularly lush widescreen print; and it's one of my favourite movies at the moment.

The DVD has two worthwhile featurettes focusing on Ginger Rogers and Gene Tierney, an informative commentary track by movie historian/author Alan Rode; interactive pressbook and picture galleries, isolated musical score track, and the theatrical trailer; plus trailers from other titles in the Fox Film Noir collection (""Daisy Kenyon"", ""Dangerous Crossing"", ""I Wake Up Screaming"" and ""Vicki"").",1248566400,2,2687,5.093394077448747
3283745,1,B0010KHOSA,"Where to begin with truly awful movie?  Ginger Rogers is just terrible.  Her performance was so bad I laughed out loud just about anytime she opened her mouth.  Sometimes I laughed out loud even when she wasn't speaking.  Her ""work"" in this movie would be justification alone for the Academy to demand the return of the Oscar they gave her for Kitty Foyle.  That she won that Oscar over Joan Fontaine (Rebecca) and Katharine Hepburn (The Philadelphia Story) was crime enough, but this performance is just plain embarrassing.  The movie looks like a filmed play with awkward stage movements and stilted dialogue that is cringe-worthy.  Ginger takes the worst acting honors but George Raft tries his best to outdo her in that department.",1244073600,4,735,4.926829268292683

3283747,4,B0010KHOSA,I liked this one! It had allot of twists and turns! Me and two other cops watched this old who done it together. I said it was the one guy and someone else said it was this other guy and the third cop figured the so called black widow was pregnant. It turned out that none of us saw the correct ending early on. It had a great cast and some descent lines for the 50's. It's not quite as good as Laura but that one really is a classic. This was just good clean fun!,1237334400,2,464,3.84375

Van is accused of murdering a woman who he was seeing on a friendly platonic basis. He goes out all to clear his name and when the murderer is revealed it is a surprise. Great interesting story with some twists at the end. This is in widescreen and in color. It has some Noir touch due to the dark mood the film goes into when the murder hits - but I wouldn't call it a true Film Noir like Nightmare Alley or Out of the Past. Call it what you will, its a very good film...",1235433600,2,658,4.108527131782946
3283749,3,B0010KHOSA,"Its really difficult to hate any film with a stellar cast such as Ginger Rogers, Gene Tierney, George Raft and Van Heflin.  For that matters, its difficult to hate any of their individual films.  Bring them together for one picture and ""hate"" might be a strong word, but ""indifferent"" fits the bill.  ""Black Widow"" feels more like a Cinemascope experiment than a cohesive and engaging film.  Cinemascope was brand spanking new and you could tell that 20th Century Fox was attempting to churn out as much product as possible in every genre possible.  No matter if the material was particularly engaging or the scripts particularly good, the studio seemed to think the public would embrace anything that was spread out on the Cinemascope canvas.  ""Black Widow"" is testament to this.  At 94 minutes there is very little here other than a scenery chewing performance by Ginger Rogers, an understated and misused Gene Tierney and a campy story line that can't quite find its footing, even after its predictable conclusion.  What does it have going for it?  Lush cinematography, gorgeous colors and excellent 1950s chic sets do a lot to keep the viewer glued to the screen.  Also, look out for an unusual Ginger Rogers role.  She plays against type which serves the plot beautifully.

The DVD of this film is really extra special with not one but two mini-docs about Ginger Rogers and Gene Tierney.  Also included is an isolated film score, an interactive pressbook, commentary and an ""over the top"" trailer that will leave you howling.  It is really an excellent group of extras.  The picture quality is truly luminous and the soundtrack is well spaced and exceptionally clear.

Tune in for the costumes, the hilarious over-the-top acting, and the stagey apartment sets all done in glorious color and Cinemascope as only Fox could do in the 50's.  Apparently someone at Fox thought this little potboiler deserved the same cinematographic treatment as ""Ben Hur""!  Gene Tierney is lovely, Ginger Rogers is delightfully catty, and most of the rest of the cast is window dressing.  Unfortunately, the mystery unravels a little too early to hold interest till the final frame.",1214870400,5,663,4.990909090909091

3283753,3,B0010KHOSA,"The year after the success of HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE Nunnally Johnson did another Cinemascope feature for Twentieth-Century Fox that this time featured two fabulous Manhattan swank and spacious apartments instead of just the one. Although BLACK WIDOW (the ill-fitting title is never explained) has been released for DVD as part of the Fox Noir series, there's almost nothing noir about it (except for one sequence, probably the best in the film, when the murder victim's hanged body is discovered); it's more of a melodramatic whodunit populated with many of Fox's slightly over-the-hill stars from the era, like Ginger Rogers, Gene Tierney, George Raft, and Van Heflin. The story (which like the direction is by Johnson) is extremely awkwardly constructed, and involves a very young writer (Peggy Ann Garner, giving the best performance in the film) whom Heflin takes into his life because of her apparent sweetness and naivete: only after she dies does he begin to see her story was much more complex than he had figured.

This is more of an ensemble piece than a star vehicle but Ginger Rogers, as a gossipy and catty theater diva, still dominates. She gives the part her all and is quite excellent in her final scenes, but she is almost singularly miscast in a part that was originally intended for Tallulah Bankhead.  There's not much competition from the other performers: Gene Tierney is almost completely wasted, Raft gives an annoying one-note performance, and Reginald Gardiner is even more hilariously miscast than Rogers. He's supposed to be her ""kept"" husband--a kind of boytoy--, even though he's over fifty, fancies ugly ascots and has about zero muscle tone in his entire body. The film's real star might be said to be not even Rogers but rather its elaborate color scheme of blues, lavenders, roses, and (especially) puce.",1211760000,7,1843,5.039344262295082

3283759,3,B0010KHOSA,"Three new film noirs and a weepy double feature---what more could you want for a late winter's evening (or evenings) entertainment? Some of the noirs are weepy, and some of the weepies are noirs, so it gets a little confusing. The one genuine, dyed-in-the-wool noir is 1953's Dangerous Crossing, coming in at a taught 76 minutes. Jeanne Crain plans to spend her honeymoon on a luxury liner with new hubby Carl Betz; problem is, hubby disappears within minutes of boarding, and all the signs point to him never existing. Kindly ship's doctor Michael Rennie straightens it all out, with a goodly number of thrills along the way. Black Widow is less successful a noir, despite the starry cast of Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney and George Raft. Set in the celebrity driven world of the New York theatre circa 1954,an ambitious young author uses her wiles to get ahead to little avail, as someone offs her halfway through the film, it's a whodunit that degenerates into a who cares. The main characters aren't drawn sharply enough, and the plot seems oddly discombobulated. With the exception of Heflin, the stars are somewhat past their prime and seem, unfortunately, a bit seedy However, Daisy Kenyon is the pick of the litter, despite it being squarely a Joan Crawford weepy rather than a noir. A love triangle with Crawford, Dana Andrews and Henry Fonda deftly directed by Otto Preminger, one in a long line of her female leads making her way with pluck and honor in a man's world. It's black and white, it rains a lot, and there are some great atmospheric shots, but a film noir it ain't. There are also vintage scenes of mid-century Provincetown, and former Cape resident Ruth Warrick plays Andrew's beleaguered wife; despite Preminger's earlier great noirs such as Laura and Whirlpool, this really is a weepy.
The weepy double feature from Universal consists of Portrait in Black and Madame X, both starring Lana Turner and produced by that sultan of excess, Ross Hunter. Hunter's reality had little relationship to anyone else's; his was a world of the rich or near rich, beautiful or near beautiful, with lots of jewels and Jean Louis gowns, where there were no small emotions, only large, operatic, over-the-top scenes. Portrait in Black is a noir, albeit a noir in blazing color that his nothing to do with the low, cheap detective thrillers we all know and love. Turner and Anthony Quinn kill off her ailing husband Lloyd Nolan, and somebody knows their dirty little secret. Is it bubbly Sandra Dee, pert John Saxon, crusty Ray Walston or the ever mysterious Anna May Wong? And, as weepy par excellance, little can be said about Madame X, other than a profound and astonished, ""wow!"" Turner, as the poor but honest wife of super rich John Forsythe, is blackmailed by her evil mother-in-law, Constance Bennett, into leaving him and their baby, who, as he grows up to be Keir Dullea, might not be such a bad idea on the face of it. Later, Lana's accused of murder and her lawyer is---you guessed it---Dullea, who has no idea that he's defending his mom. You know, they simply are not making films like this any more. We may all be better off.",1205798400,5,3156,4.7714808043875685
