2684018,5,B000K7UIOG,"Wow is this a hard workout or not???  I'm fairly fit, but this was still a little tough going and she even states that in the opening.  She recommends that if you are beginning or are even intermediate, that you may want to do another of her workouts.

Having said that, this is great though.  If you want to sweat and burn some major calories, then this is for you.  There is Gin and one other exerciser and she is showing the modifications.  When they do the intervals there is a line bar graph that counts down the time left and shows you in different colours how you should be feeling.  She also asks that you gauge your level of work based on the 1 to 10 system.  This will push you to the absolute max.  She wants you to get to 10, but not to remain there for a long time.  There is nothing difficult about the moves - they are all moves you will know if you already step - but it's the intensity that kills.

If you are fit and want to get fitter, or if you want to lose some weight but have already been working out for some time now, then try this.  It's challenging and fun.  She's a great instructor that is friendly, down to earth and also takes no nonsense.  She is not kidding around.  I love this workout and while I don't always make it right through to the end, I have a lot of fun trying and it's a great goal to set for yourself and achieve.  I highly recommend this.",1165190400,38,1386,4.0777777777777775
2684049,5,B000K7UIOG,This was a great one hour workout. it flew by and in no time I was done.. and a sweaty mess.. :) If you do not feel this in your legs the next day you did something wrong. I followed her more then the other girl that was doing a lower modified version of the workout. Great cal burn.,1339459200,,283,3.8135593220338984
2684050,5,B000K7UIOG,"I had done a lot of step aerobics at a younger age so did have some background in step basics.  I got the advanced level figuring as I got in shape I would be able to do more, as opposed to buying a beginner/intermediate dvd. I do really enjoy this workout.  As stated by others, the quality isn't the same as an HD dvd, but it didn't make  a difference to me.  After you have finished, you know you have gotten a good workout!  I would recommend it to anyone.",1329436800,,460,4.066666666666666
2684051,4,B000K7UIOG,This dvd is another Gin classic. The combinations are easy to learn and the hard/harder options are great depending on how you are feeling that day. Her timing and delivery are great as usual and you honestly feel like she is in the room with you rooting you on but not in a non stop over chatty way. Having Mandy in the video helps a lot - because you have both of them to watch and the time just flies!!!This is the third dvd I have purchased of hers and probably my favorite.,1315353600,2,478,4.150537634408602
2684052,5,B000K7UIOG,"I really enjoy this workout. I love step aerobic workouts but always worry the routines will get too complicated. This one is really straight forward. Gin Miller is excellent. She shows you how to modify the workout to make it even harder by adding additional movements or jumps and then when you do the interval or high intensity for one minute you can choose which moves to incorporate for the greatest intensity. There are 8 sections or routines and I'm always amazed how fast it goes by. I'm also impressed with how quickly my cardio condition has improved in just 2-3 weeks by doing this workout only 2 times a week. I do other workouts on the off days but this one does require a little more recovery for your body. If you are in good cardio shape and want something different that will really challenge you, try this workout. It's a great addition to any in-home library and it is strictly cardio, there are no weights, bands, etc. Gin Miller does offer other step workouts that are for beginners or intermediate level workouts which I'm sure would be good also, but this one I LOVE!",1310428800,2,1090,4.566326530612245
2684053,4,B000K7UIOG,"This workout is nowhere near the intensity level I was expecting given Gin's introduction and the majority of the reviews. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser and I regularly work out with videos by Cathe, Kelly Coffey-Meyer, Jari Love, etc. A few of the segments in Simply Interval got fairly intense, but there was SO much downtime in between. For many segments, however, my heart rate simply didn't get up to where I'd have expected it to be, given Gin's introduction. Frankly, I'm a bit mystified by some of the reviews claiming that this is ""one of the most intense step videos on the market."" All that said, I keep the DVD in my rotation for days when I'm looking for a lighter cardio workout with no-brainer footwork.",1309219200,,741,4.796875
2684054,5,B000K7UIOG,"I love step workouts.  When I first started going to a gym when I was 18 (about 12 years ago), I attended my first step class and I was really lucky that the instructor was phenomenal.  She had amazing cueing, great music to pump you up, and modifications, as well as, advanced options for almost every move/combination.  Her choreography had everything you wanted in a step workout - across the tops, over the tops, knees/sides/kicks/squats/lunges, jumps/turns/spins/shuffles/""L""s - not to dancey and not too simple.  For many years I was hooked on step classes.

I've found more recently though (this is just my experience) that the quality of instructors is just not the same in step classes anymore.  When LESmills took over most of the gyms in my area, I found BODYSTEP (a program where they have the exact same choreography and music in EVERY step class for, I believe, a few weeks to a few months) to be too easy or too boring.  The instructors who were teaching step classes were no longer ""step"" instructors, they were just instructors certified in LESmills BODYSTEP and other LESmills classes, and frankly, they weren't very good.  So somewhere along the way, I stopped attending step classes and started running and participating in boot camp groups.

I recently relocated and wanted to get back into step but I didn't want to have to go searching the city trying a million step classes to find one step instructor that I liked.  So, I decided to go on amazon and read reviews of step DVDs to see what everyone was saying about at home step workouts.  I'm so glad that I did that because after reading the reviews I bought Gin's Simply Interval and I have absolutely no regrets.  What better than to ""take"" a class from the creator of step herself?

I must admit, the quality of the DVD doesn't look as professional as other workouts out there (like any of the beach body series), but once I tried the workout, the mild difference in production quality was balanced with the high quality of the workout instruction and workout itself.

Here's what I loved:

- The music is perfect - it has the right amount of bass to keep you on beat but it's not distracting.
- Gin's cueing is beyond fabulous and her voice is perfectly audible - and she is super likeable and natural
- It is just like taking a class - each combo is broken down bit by bit and then done altogether for one minute straight.
- Each combo is easy enough to learn but consists of moves that get your heart pumping when you go all-out
- Covers all the moves you would want/need to know to do step workout.
- I never get bored of it and it is a great workout that leaves me dripping with sweat every time!

I wouldn't say it is totally advanced (like Amy Bento's advanced step challenge series), but if you don't know step terminology or aren't very coordinated, I would try something more basic first.  That said don't let that deter you from trying, this is a fantastic workout from start to finish and Gin Miller is the queen of step!  I have no interest in shopping around for a good step instructor at the local gym anymore.  This workout satifies all my stepping needs and gets the job done.  If anything, I'll just be looking for more step DVDs to do from home.

Happy stepping! :)",1292544000,5,3262,4.532423208191126
2684055,1,B000K7UIOG,Be very careful when doing this dvd.  I tore my calf muscle while doing this dvd.  The injury occured over 2 months ago and I am still having trouble with my calf.,1271462400,2,163,4.0625
2684056,4,B000K7UIOG,I like this Simply Interval DVD; in my opinion it works for beginner and advanced step users. I consider myself in between so when i want to work hard I use the DVD and the advanced moves; when I don't want to work as hard I use the alternative moves in the DVD. It has proved to work great for me.,1267660800,,298,3.901639344262295
2684057,5,B000K7UIOG,"I have never used a step dvd and have only been to a few step workout classes (I am pretty clumsy) and I didn't really like it. But this video, even though it says it is for intermediate-expert...all levels can do it. If I can't do a step in an interval I can replace it with another that Gin has gone over previously. Everytime I work out to this dvd it kicks my butt and I am a 23 year old in good health! I am sweating like a pig and felt I got a really good work out! I did my research before I finally decided on a dvd and this was the best choice I could have made!",1257897600,2,571,3.7666666666666666
2684058,5,B000K7UIOG,I really enjoy doing a Gin Miller workout! She is the best at what she does!,1256169600,,76,3.8125
2684069,5,B000K7UIOG,"I really loved this workout. It is perfect for someone like me. I am not a beginner on the step and I train very regularly. I'm in my forties and have a lot of weight to lose, but I am in very good shape for my size. I think it's important for the readers to know this information. It says I'm not a twenty years old 110 pounds girl. I could do the easier version and was pretty comfortable with it. I like that I have room for improvement. The more I lose weight, the easier it will be to do the advanced version. And I totally agree with ""little miss cutey""'s review. I couldn't describe this dvd better than she did (I'm French speaking so it's harder for me to write in English...). Very happy with this dvd. I think I will do it for a long time. And I agree too with the person who says that this dvd is not hard enough. I suppose this person is already in very great shape and not overweight. There are other dvd's that are more complex and more intense for those people. But I think this one will do the job for a lot of people.",1255564800,10,1035,4.029126213592233
2684070,5,B000K7UIOG,This is a great intermediate to advanced step workout.  It is broken up into eight circuits with rest periods in between.  I am at an intermediate level and find this to be a challenge with only one riser under the step.,1243814400,3,220,4.341463414634147
2684071,5,B000K7UIOG,"My wife and I like to exercise together and she likes to do video workouts.  The only one I could ever stand was one of the old Reebok step tapes.  So my wife suggested we get some other Gin Miller videos.  We got this one and Serious Strength.  I really like these.  I stay motivated, don't get bored, and feel like I am actually getting results, as opposed to other videos that just made me feel like I was flopping around pointlessly.  Several of my muscle groups are feeling noticeably tighter and firmer after only a few weeks.  We will definitely buy more of her videos so that we can vary our workouts even more.",1236816000,5,619,4.3304347826086955
2684072,5,B000K7UIOG,I really loved this DVD. It's like 2 in 1 cause Gin Miller has got company doing the same exercice in a easier pattern and impact.,1221868800,,130,4.038461538461538
2684073,5,B000K7UIOG,"This is an excellent step work out--sure, the production values are not exactly great, but the work out is fantastic, and Gin is just great as an instructor--does not take herself too seriously, or try to be ""cathe""--ick.  If this workout is not hard enough for you, you ain't doing it right--you can add all the jumps and intensity and height you need to keep it challenging, and yet the moves are easy to follow, so your brain doesn't have to have a hard work out--just the bod.",1211155200,6,480,4.454545454545454
2684074,5,B000K7UIOG,"Wow, by the med-to-end of this video, I was definately sweating and heart pounding.  It will be some time before I ""work up"" to this one.  Haven't made it thru it yet.  Very good cardio work-out.  Not for ""light"" days.  This one is definately in my workout rotation.  Another decent, cardio work-out from Gin.",1198886400,5,309,4.62962962962963
2684075,5,B000K7UIOG,"I picked up this Gin Miller tape because I have enjoyed other Step tapes she'd made.  She uses good cues and the choreography is easy to follow which allows you to focus on form and effort level rather than complex foot and arm movements.  I was expecting the Interval tape to be a smaller challenge as I've been stepping for several years.  It was more of a challenge than I expected!  This routine WILL get your blood pumping.  Don't let that scare you, though.  Gin Miller provides three different workout levels allowing you to create the level of workout you want or need.  If you like interval training, this is a good tape for you!",1198108800,20,638,4.495652173913044

2684077,5,B000K7UIOG,"Gin Miller is an excellent instructor (enthusiastic without being annoyingly perky), and this workout is structured so that there are multiple options for each move, from somewhat of a moderate level up to what Gin describes as ""nasty"" -- so it's the perfect workout video as far as I'm concerned.  At the conclusion of this workout, you will have no doubt that you have burned some calories.  And...even better... the workout feels as if it goes by quickly, which is important to me because I really hate exercising!!!",1174262400,2,519,4.886363636363637
2684078,2,B000K7UIOG,"Already having Gin Miller's ""STEP Reebok: Intense Moves,"" I was eager to try this workout.  I wanted to like it, but I found it to be extremely boring.  While there were a few intense moves, it does not compare to the Reebok video, as far as production quality or workout intensity.  The video is really geared for people just starting interval training.  If you are new to this type of workout, go for it.  However, if you're used to her previous videos, you'll be disappointed.",1173484800,21,479,4.588235294117647

8154921,5,B000K7UIOG,GREAT VIDEO!!!!! The steps are very familiar to what I use to do back in the day.  That is why the stepping was so easy and natural for me.,1450051200,,139,3.793103448275862
8154922,5,B000K7UIOG,"love the way she teaches, her work outs and easy to learn and follow",1444089600,,68,3.9285714285714284
8154923,5,B000K7UIOG,"I love this workout. It brings back memories of the early Gin Miller step workouts when the concept first came out. She's still fun, and this is a decent workout that's not too long. There are eight cycles, or intervals, in which Gin teaches the moves required for that interval, and then you do the cycle full-out for a minute.  There's an active rest after each cycle,  and then it's on to the next routine.  It moves quickly so it's never boring.

You can make it tougher by adding runs/jumps, or by adding wrist weights and/or a weighted vest, if desired.  If you walk and step the workout, it's not real hard, but it's easy to ""step up"" the difficulty (pun intended)!",1442361600,5,672,4.475409836065574
8154924,2,B000K7UIOG,"Service by Amazon was great, but I'm not crazy about the video. I do mostlunch Cathe and Kelly Coffey-Meyer videos but I thought I'd give this a try since after all Gin Miller did invent step aerobics. The moves are repetitive and boring and there's too much going on with the constant perceived exertion chart on the screen. It does work up a sweat and I'll do it occasionally,  but the dread factor on this one is high.",1409097600,,421,4.397435897435898
8154925,4,B000K7UIOG,"You cannot go wrong if you are interested in a step training workout and chose Gin Miller.  She owns this type of workout! I do like this very much.  Would have given it 5 stars but I think some of the steps are difficult to follow, even  for someone like me who still does her original workout.",1398729600,,295,4.140350877192983
8154926,5,B000K7UIOG,"I was looking for a boot camp type step workout and I got that in this dvd; a simple step routine, but a hard workout! Gin is a great instructor. I wish there were more step dvds like it and instructors like Gin.

The advanced part of this step workout does not refer to the ability to execute tricky dance moves; it refers to fitness level. However, I started doing this dvd when I was totally and completely out of shape and loved doing it anyway.

A few thoughts:

Interval training is supposed to have down time; that is what interval is. It is not less of a workout; it is a particular kind of workout. If you do not like doing intervals this dvd is not for you.

Give yourself ""permission"" to not add any risers to your step. You may be able to do another step dvd using one or two risers, but you may not be able to this routine with any at all. It is ok.

You do not have to follow this routine in one particular way. I mix and match the harder and easier moves. For instance, when Gin does traveling jump lunges, I choose not travel across the step because it feels like I could injure my knee and it is unnecessary in order to transition into the next move and when I find that I am ""just making it"" when jumping onto the step, I stop and follow Gin's partner who is doing the less advanced moves. I join Gin again when I am ready.

IMHO
If you complete the advanced routine all the way through using two risers under your step and feel like you are not getting a good workout, I wouldn't say this dvd is too easy;  I would say that you should give yourself credit for being in such amazing shape!

Happy Stepping!",1366934400,3,1624,4.133333333333334
8154927,5,B000K7UIOG,"Gin Miller is a great instructor.  The exercises are easy to follow and Gin knows the right timing introducing the next add ons for each cycle.  I do not regret buying her dvds, in fact I have 4 of her dvds at home.",1359849600,,215,3.9767441860465116
8154928,5,B000K7UIOG,"I have done a lot of step aerobics over the years.  Gin's Reebok Intense Moves is the most interesting and effective DVD I have ever used.  This one is second best.  Not quite as intense or interesting, but fantastic nonetheless.  She's energetic and funny.  Her cuing is excellent, and you can easily make it more or less intense to suit your level of fitness.  You get a great workout in a short time.",1351123200,,403,4.4520547945205475
8154929,5,B000K7UIOG,"This video is just as advertised.  I previewed the video before actually doing it and thought it would be much harder to follow than it is.  I did only the beginner level moves and have lots of room to ramp up the workout, but was able to follow along with the steps fairly easily first time through -- she really is a great instructor.  I like that she has someone doing the ""easier"" moves while she does the more difficult adaptations.  A really great aspect of this workout is how quickly the time goes by -- to me, that's the hallmark of a great video.  No time to get bored!  Gin's demeanor is informal and friendly yet motivational.  I intend to do this twice a week and see if it provides metabolic and endurance benefits.",1340755200,2,729,4.355555555555555
