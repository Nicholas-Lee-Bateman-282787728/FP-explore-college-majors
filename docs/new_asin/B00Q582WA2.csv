6854264,5,B00Q582WA2,"The anime is great and the picture quality is awesome for being an old show on DVD. This is just the episodes and OVAs and that's all I wanted, so 5 stars from me.",1427587200,,163,3.823529411764706

6854266,5,B00Q582WA2,"I've wanted to see this anime for a very long time. When it was airing on Cartoon Network, I was young enough that I was till being made to go to bed early on a Saturday. I had pre-ordered this, and once I got it, I watched a lot of it in one day, and got to the end in 3 days. I cannot rave enough at how much I loved this. I already pre-ordered Legend of the Twilight, because I know I'll enjoy that too!",1426896000,4,406,3.7325581395348837
6854267,2,B00Q582WA2,Well drawn but very boring. The show just does not pull you in. The backgrounds and music are very well done. The characters are par for the time this anime was produced. The story however is just plain slow and you don't feel excited about what's happening in the show. Pass on this one....classic or not.,1426809600,,306,4.482142857142857

6854272,4,B00Q582WA2,"A warning - this show starts off a tad slow. A few characters leave little to be desired at times, but overall the pace is pretty steady and most of the characters were developed well. The ending came together nicely.",1478563200,,217,4.45

6854274,5,B00Q582WA2,".hack//SIGN is based on a video game for the PlayStation 2 that I once played but never finished.

This is the anime that started the whole ""trapped in a MMORPG"" genre ....although one character is stuck within The World, the MMO.  The World seems to be a pretty boring game since all you do is hunt for treasure and kill monsters.  Not that all MMOs are like that but there's no grand story like there is in, say, World of Warcraft.....and this franchise was made before World of Warcraft came out.

This series is about Tsukasa the player that can't log out of The World.  Tsukasa is not very social and not that interesting in the scheme of things.....neither are the other characters quite frankly.

There's not much action either....all the characters do is talk and talk and while, yes, that's the entire reason for a MMORPG that's not the main reason why people play those games.  The characters hardly ever go to a dungeon.

The music is OUTSTANDING and sublime.....quite possibly my favorite anime soundtrack of all time.

The voice acting is good for what it is.

Despite my dissing earlier I do like this anime but I also notice its flaws.  But there are few flaws and the animation is stunningly beautiful",1475884800,,1217,4.640186915887851
6854275,5,B00Q582WA2,Thank you for providing such an excellent product.,1475539200,,50,5.375

6854277,4,B00Q582WA2,"The concept of being trapped in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) is a fairly common one in manga and anime, but different things fascinate different creators.  Thus, the core principle behind Sword Art Online is ""Die in the game; die in real life"" while the core principle behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Log-Horizon/dp/B00M3TK7Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Log Horizon</a>&nbsp;is ""Since you are stuck in the game, make the best of it.""  So what is the core principle behind .hack//?

""Whenever one or more players falls into an irreversible coma, problem,""... but that didn't make it completely uninteresting.

I guess the content free, generic product descriptions on all the DVD boxes should have been a clue; this is NOT an easy to understand anime and thus is not necessarily a good choice for fans of the above mentioned anime series.  In fact it is far less about playing the game (the characters do more talking with each other than playing) than it is about the flawed and human game players themselves.

Briefly, Tsukasa awakens in the midst of ongoing playing of the MMORPG The World, unable to remember and unable to log out, and the plot involves his gradual gaining of information and allies increasingly determined to help him log out.  The premise is fascinating but at least in the anime, unfinished; you will have to read more information about the .hack franchise in order to figure out entirely what is going on.

Note: Funimation has done a marvelous job of assembling a low cost but complete DVD version of this series: 25 regular episodes, 1 compilation episode, 2 OVA episodes, all arranged logically and shown on the inside of the case, and assorted extras; I raised my rating a star for this alone!

Note: Funimation has also released the following .hack items:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hack-Legend-of-the-Twilight-Complete-Series/dp/B00SHEOVDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">.hack//Legend of the Twilight: Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hack-Roots-Complete-Series/dp/B00TQGGDRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">.hack//Roots: Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hack-G-U-Trilogy-Movie/dp/B00V7ORPOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">.hack//G.U.

6854279,4,B00Q582WA2,Classic and unbeatable for what it is in my opinion. It shows its age in some respects but it doesn't mean you should pass it up.,1461542400,,129,4.0

6854281,5,B00Q582WA2,I ordered this as a gift for my wife for our 7th wedding anniversary and boy did she love it!! She had individual desks of the first part of the series and the last part but this the first time she had entire series. However I will warn you people that if you like action packed anime this is not for you. This is a serious face mostly on dialogue rather than action and if you're looking at going into looking for it you will be bored out of your mind waiting for something to happen. But if you like dialogue based drama this is right up your alley.,1459209600,2,551,4.064220183486238
6854282,5,B00Q582WA2,Watching it right now. I love it. Brings back great memories. I remember even playing the games on my Playstation.,1455667200,,114,4.75

6854284,4,B00Q582WA2,"The original ""Trapped in a video game"" show. Great if you have never seen some of the newer ones, but after watching Sword Art Online, its a BIT on the slow side.",1454544000,,162,4.09375
6854285,5,B00Q582WA2,I loved this series since it was on cartoon network 10+ years ago and now I'm able to watch this amazing anime for as long as I want! 296% satisfied!!!,1451433600,,151,4.066666666666666
6854286,5,B00Q582WA2,"Oh so much love for this classic anime, it came to me fast and well packaged.
The music in this anime alone is enough to buy it, the art is 2nd and the story is great. I watched this many many years ago as a child on adult swim. It was deep but I caught on to it, might have taken a couple watches on adult swim but I got it. Lol.
Great show!",1448928000,2,342,3.635135135135135

6854288,5,B00Q582WA2,"I know anime critics dislike this series, but in my opinion it's leagues above the other, ""Stuck in Internet World"" series. You have to consider the low budget, combined with the ambition of the games. It turned out really good. Liminality, Quantum are also recommended. Steer clear of Dusk/Twilight and Roots. There's also a CGI movie, avoid that too. Each of the series retains it's theme, but is VERY different from each other.",1445644800,,430,4.904109589041096

6854291,5,B00Q582WA2,I remember watching this in my teens. This is the first anime i ever watched and even now going back and watching it all over again I am in love. Great anime!! At times it is confusing however well worth watching.,1437264000,2,213,4.219512195121951
6854292,5,B00Q582WA2,"It might not have the action of your fancy new Sword Art Onlines or your Log Horizon, but it's still the o.g. of anime about people getting trapped in a video game.",1435881600,,164,4.15625
6854293,2,B00Q582WA2,"Art work is of good quality but the story drags on for long periods relying on long takes of the same scene,  I would not buy it again.",1435708800,,135,3.8214285714285716
6854294,2,B00Q582WA2,"I was hoping for an anime as epic as the newer dot Hack anime that one can find on hulu (not sure of the complete series name). This anime is rather very slow paced. in fact, I haven't even finished watching the whole thing. I'm taking a break from it that is at disc four of four.",1434758400,,281,3.9473684210526314
6854295,3,B00Q582WA2,"I'll begin by saying I'm a diehard fan of the .hack series. It was the first major anime I think that really hooked me into the world of JRPGs and such. That being said I also own a load of .hack merchandise (games/anime/etc) and when this was re released in an affordable bundle (as the original runs almost over $100.) I was excited to relive what I felt was the quintessential anime series, boy how I forgot how the sign saga was... To begin .hack sign is the beginning of the series of .hack (fragment novels/manga are prequels but this is the kick off point.) Now this is roughly ten years or more old and animation wise/voice acting isn't the best out there even compared to back then but its not bad. The reason that me, again huge hack fan, gives only a three star is that this entry in the series doesn't hold up today. The story is very...very slow. Characters are introduced with little fan fare and there is so much dialogue it drove me to actually fall asleep during an episode, and I've seen some very talkative anime. I think .hack was at its time something so unique in the world of anime, trapped in a video game mmorpg and such, but now its being done by so many other series (log horizon and Sword Art Online to name two popular ones) that against those behemoths it cant strive as it did years ago. Is this a bad show, hell no. .hack is still the father of this trapped in game concept in the world of anime and it has that going for it. Yet when you see the pacing of Log Horizon or the action of Sword Art Online compared to .hack sign it makes the show weaker. Overall .hack sign is still a needed entry to those who have always wanted the complete series but couldn't grab it earlier then now. Is it a great show, no, but it has a beauty that many will need to witness and understand to enjoy it, like art not everyone will enjoy a particular piece but some will love it, others cringe.",1434499200,2,1910,4.25
6854296,1,B00Q582WA2,"I love anime. I bought this because of the rep that the original series carries. Unfortunately this aimless drivel has burnt all my interest in .hack out of my system. A truly uninspired 'what is really going on in the game' story, where sneak views of the real world prove even less interesting than events in-game.

Every six or seven episodes, something happens. Not something of major interest mind you, just something other than characters aimlessly waiting and talking.

Avoid!",1434326400,2,483,5.025
6854297,5,B00Q582WA2,".hack//SIGN is as wonderful now as it was when it first aired years ago. The wonderful music and atmosphere enriches a lore that manages to be driven by characters and the relationships they build with one another. The animation manages to hold uniqueness even while bringing up the fact in an MMO there can be factors such as character designs that can look similar and even brings that up in the series. It manages to stand alone while at the same time able to move the story forward into the original .hack games. Some people may be turned off by how slow the story can be in terms of how fantasies should go, but the richness of The World and those who inhabit it make use of that pace to build everything up to examine on a deeper level.",1433030400,2,742,4.345323741007194

8690374,5,B00Q582WA2,".hack//SIGN was one of the original anime series that really hooked me into anime for good way back when. I used to stay up super late and make sure I watched at least it, and then after it quit airing, all of the prequels as well. I played every game and loved them equally. That said, this DVD collection is amazing. Granted, I already had all of it before, but having it condensed to one case is great for fans and new comers alike. I always recommend this series to my friends and I hope and pray that we will continue to see more of it in the years to come!",1500249600,,562,4.072072072072072
