8546076,5,B00A1PECMQ,"Bought this for the two Shakespeare related lectures in Chapter 18 and 19 out of 36.

Seth Leher is good. He is a polished speaker.

The DVDs were very deeply discounted. These lectures are beyond rare, circa 1998 and all.

Another famous bargain from amazon.com

These professors are making a damn fool out of themselves on air account of me. Professor or not, polished and glib (smooth) makes no difference, They are wearing the Emperor's New Clothes. This is something that runs through the Great Courses Lectures on topics A to Z like iridium in the K2 Extinction Boundary in the Earth's crust. Riddled. Peppered. Etc.

These productions of 36 lectures were made prior to the 911 police emergency telephone number attacks of the WorldTradeCenter.

Finished these two Shakespeare lectures within hours of getting them through the USPS.

The most astonishing thing I learned from these lectures is that the Christian martyr, Tyndale coined the term: eat, drink and be merry (for the morrow may never come). Who knows. He may have coined this very close to the day he was strangled and burned at the stake alive-circa 1536. Proving the compassion of kings especially Henry VIII.

Let us not forget his successor, Queen Elizabeth who had the heart and stomach of a king. It is good to king/queen.
