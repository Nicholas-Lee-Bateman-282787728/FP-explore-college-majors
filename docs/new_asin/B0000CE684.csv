1918734,1,B0000CE684,one of the worst films i ever saw......were we supposed to sympathize with the Maggie Smith Character?.....i was sympothizing with the Cooper having to suffer her drunken ramblings......the ending was laughable.....were we supposed to be happy that the child was left in the care of this mad drunkerd?....dear o dear......!,1095465600,14,323,5.48
1918735,5,B0000CE684,"I have put off watching ""My House in Umbria"" because having seen the trailers I assumed it was similar to ""A Room With a View"" or ""My House in Tuscany.""  That was because the trailers emphasized the cast and the location rather than the plot.  So when I finally watched this 2003 film made for HBO I was rather surprised to discover what ""My House in Umbria"" is all about.

The film is based on William Trevor's 1991 short novel.  The house in Umbria belongs to Emily Delahunty (Maggie Smith), an aging romance novlist who boards a train for a shopping trip to Milan.  She finds a seat in a crowded compartment where she joins an American family with a young daughter who likes to ask questions, a pair of young German lovers who are busy enjoying each other, and a retired English general and his family.  Then a bomb goes off.

Most of the people in the compartment are killed by the blast.  Along with Emily one member from each group surives the explosion and end up in the same hospital with varying degrees of wounds, both physical and psychological.  Eventually Emily takes the other survivors back to her house in Umbria, where she and her faithful servant Quinty (Timothy Spall) continue to minister to their needs.  But what has happened intrudes on this peaceful environment, first when an Italian police inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) shows up as part of the investigation of the bomb and then when Thomas Riversmith (Chris Cooper) arrives to claim his relative.

The character of Emily Delahunty is more compelling that the story.  Played with a rather uncharacteristic restraint by Smith, she is a novelist who cannot help but see stories in the people she has taken into her home.  I do not mean this in the sense that she wants to exploit their tragedy by writing a story but rather that her writer's imagination is always filing in the gaps regarding the lives of her visitors.  A word or a look is enough for Emily to imagine the rest, spinning out the narrative in her mind.  Based on these imaginings, whose accuracy is always in question, she reacts accordingly, and the question is whether she is healing herself at the same time she is trying so hard to heal these others.

Both Hugh Whitemore's script and director Richard Loncraine's do what they can to showcase Smith's performance.  This dame Dame Maggie is not puling out all the stops but showing the importance of small things, like a quick glanced or a carefully nuances word.  The police inspector and Riversmith both represent challenges to the way Emily sees the world, but out hearts if not out minds are with her efforts.",1094428800,22,2607,4.6798245614035086
1918736,4,B0000CE684,"This movie is very touching.  It may not be the most surprising or action packed of movies, but it can touch you if you let it.  So many people, all touched by the same tragedy, having to come together, and share and learn and grow together.  I think you'll enjoy it.",1086825600,5,267,4.196078431372549
1918737,1,B0000CE684,"I had high hopes for this movie, having fallen in love with ""Under A Tuscan Sun"" and hoping that ""My House In Umbria"" would be similar.
I couldn't have been further from the truth.  Quite frankly, I hated this movie.  I thought Maggie Smith was pompous and incredibly annoying, particularly in her pursuit of the American which didn't seem to fit anywhere into the movie.
If it's Italy you're craving do yourself a favor and rent ""Under A Tuscan Sun"".",1085356800,12,451,4.625
1918738,4,B0000CE684,"I am a great Maggie Smith fan, so when I found this movie, I had to see it.  I must say, in my opinion I would classify it as an ""Artsy-Fartsy"" movie... but in spite of that, I LOVED IT.  To a certain degree, I think everyone can identify with a life full of pains and sorrows, and still being able to help out others when they are in need.  This is the description of true humanity... to see past your own pains, and lend a hand to someone else. The only thing in my opinion that makes this unsuitable for pre-teens, other than excessive alcohol consumption to mask emotional pain, is that there is a quick flash of Mrs Delahuntys upper torso, at one point.",1083542400,6,658,4.2063492063492065
1918739,1,B0000CE684,"I watched this on reccommendation from a friend.

1918740,5,B0000CE684,"You can read some of the other reviews to get more of the gist of the plot, but I just want to add that this movie is well worth seeing. This movie should move you. Dame Maggie Smith,portraying an aging romance novelist, is elegant, understated, and honest. She shows in her anguish the depths of her depression as she senses old age coming upon her and her appeal as a woman all but snuffed out.  The girl (I don't have her name on hand, unfortunately) who played the child who had lost both her parents in the bomb blast and was still in the early stages of recovery when her uncle wanted to uproot her from her new home in Umbria, was breathtakingly luminous.  The young actress plays the part with such sincerity. She does not have much of a speaking role, but she becomes by way of the intermingling of the characters, the focal point of the movie. Her interaction with Mrs. Delahonte (sp?)(Maggie Smith) and with Werner, the young German, is deeply moving. As Mrs. Delahonte (sp?) becomes deeply attached to the young girl and it appears that this relationship will be tragically severed, you realize that the notion of family and emotional bonding is never defined by blood ties alone. The relationship between Mrs. Delahonte and the young girl is beautifully portrayed. This movie is timeless in its message:  we all should forgive because we all have something for which we need to be forgiven.",1073260800,125,1403,4.649193548387097
1918741,5,B0000CE684,If you are a fan of Maggie Smith then you must not miss this special film. This Beautiful Heartfelt story was a welcome switch for me in contrast to all the violence on HBO as of late.

1918744,5,B0000CE684,"Before I saw the movie last summer. As first impressions, I didn't know
what to expect and the title of the film seemed boring, but I loved
Dame Maggie Smith so I gave the movie a chance.

Based on a novel by William Trevor is about a sophisticated,
vulnerable, eccentric Authoress called Mrs Emily Delahunty (Maggie
Smith) who is on her way to Milan on a monthly shopping trip with
acquaintances on a carriage 219, they were about to look forward to the
day in their own way until a bomb exploded on the carriage. Delahunty,
Werner the young German (Benno F&uuml;rmann), General (Ronnie Barker),
traumatised although unscathed but gone mute from the horror is 8 year
old American Girl Aimee (Emmy Clarke) who are survivors. Out of
Kindness and loneliness- Delahunty invite them to stay long term to her
healing pensione and recuperate in piece of paradise, the scenic vistas of
the Italian country living. Thomas Riversmith (Chris Cooper) enters as
Aimee's nitpicking Scientific Uncle with his share of brokenness and
he too is slowly going through a transition like the others. As soon as
healing process begins with everyone and coming to terms of their loses
and gains through friendship, magic happens as well as their own
purposes and Destinies.

The atmosphere of this movie reminds me of Tea with Mussolini, but with
a simplified plot whereas Tea with Mussolini has more characters and
more serious Drama, My House in Umbria is light-hearted but you feel
just as sympathetic for the characters.

The versatile Maggie Smith is such a legend and won a deserved award as
the dry humoured, elegant, Earth Angel that has a spiritual gift who
comes to terms with a troubled secret past in search of her inner
fulfilment as her form of Happiness, Inspector Girotti (Giancarlo
Giannini from ""a walk in the clouds"") is brilliant, Quinty (Timothy Spall) is wonderful as her
assistant (his Irish accent is flawless). Chris Cooper is interesting
as the attractive but blunt and straight laced Professor who is
secretly passionate but not engaging to social relationships besides
his work. Ronnie Barker is a British comedian as his serious acting role as the General shows he has fabulous Talent. F&uuml;rmann has the look of dread, pain and worry he put on a smart
performance. The cast is wonderful, the setting, the pacing of the
movie is perfect.

What an enchanting movie with magic like Chocolat, it has warmth and
charm without the Hocus Pocus. Goes to show that Humans as a living
spirit can make magic when they connect.

I own this movie on DVD now and can't stop watching it. Well done.",1494288000,,2593,4.844243792325057

1918753,3,B0000CE684,"All the ingredients of a good story are in here but the director and writer(s) aren't sure what to do with them. The story meanders at first, almost comes to a halt then picks up when Mr. Riversmith arrives (just over half an hour in). Then with an interesting group of characters on stage it seems the writers can't make up their minds who is background colour and who is vital to the plot. There is some good acting, mainly from the ghoulish Mr. Riversmith (Chris Cooper), Maggie Smith performing 'What happened to Jean Brodie next', and Timothy Spall as her offbeat man-about-the-house. Against a slightly schmaltzy backdrop of Umbria there are interesting sidelights on different ways of looking at life, some of which will upset the more prudish viewers.
Altogether, not a bad movie given what else is out there, but frustrating in that you feel with more committed direction, incisive writing and a clear idea of what they wanted it to say, this could have been a great film.",1486598400,,981,4.742690058479532
1918754,3,B0000CE684,"You and I both know that you're going to watch this because it's nearly two hours of Maggie Smith, which makes it automatically better than 99% of the things you could possibly do with that time.  But it's only fair to remind you: Maggie can make something quite watchable out of practically nothing, and that's exactly what she has to work with here.  She is not well-served by her script, or her costars, or her cinematographer.  The pacing is ... languid ... and other choices could have been made in the editing.  The story itself is unrewarding.  And you're going to watch it anyway, because Maggie can do what no one else can, which is to convince you that you care about this, at least while she's on screen.",1483747200,3,715,4.511627906976744

1918757,3,B0000CE684,"okay, this movie IS pretty to look at and mostly enjoyable to watch - but it's hardly the 'jolly holiday' some reviews hint at. It's basically the story of an alcoholic tramp abandoned in Morocco to 'fend for herself' who ends up with an impossibly gorgeous house in Umbria, supposedly earned by writing lousy romance novels. There are several cringe-inducing moments in the movie, with large men lowering themselves onto her in black/white flashbacks, when she was trying to 'find her way' out of Morocco (???) and the worst, when she nearly flashes a boob at poor Chris Cooper, while trying to get him drunk so she could take advantage of him ... what was Maggie Smith THINKING ???
 Well, perhaps she had two lovely months on location ... and the film is lovely, twitchy politics aside. Most of the rest of the cast fares pretty well, although Timothy Spall need subtitles, even when speaking English.  I'd say: rent, don't buy ... no intention of sitting through this slightly revolting mess again.",1481673600,,1001,4.813953488372093

1918770,4,B0000CE684,"This BBC movie, strongly cast and beautifully filmed, takes the darkest edge off William Trevor's 1991 novella but still preserves a focus on the important questions it raises about how to make a life after trauma -- in this case an explosion in a train carriage in Italy that robs an old man of his children, a young American girl of her parents, and a young man of his lover.  The three survivors of these losses are invited by the only other survivor, Emily Delahunty (Maggie Smith), to recuperate at her house in Umbria.  The most apparently obviously traumatized is the young girl Aimee (Emily Clarke), who doesn't speak for a long time after the event, and the driver of the narrative interest is the arrival of her uncle, Thomas Riversmith (Chris Cooper), who clearly doesn't know her and was not on good terms with her mother, his sister, but who feels the pull (or is it a drag?) of family obligation and has come to take her back to America.  I won't give away how all this is resolved in the movie -- it differs a bit from the novella -- but I'll just note that the thematic heart of the movie is the conflict between Emily, who is a highly-successful writer of second rate romantic novels (under several noms-de-plumes), and Thomas, who is an academic scientist whose field is ants.

The thematic interest, then, is on the question of the need for imagination and, going along with that, re-invention, as a restorer and preserver of health and sanity.  As the movie goes on, we begin to understand that Emily herself is a living embodiment of imaginative self-reinvention, and Maggie Smith, in a very fine performance, does Trevor's story justice in letting us see how close together are those elements of imagination that are life-enhancing and those that seem something close to obsessive or crazy.  Against that stands Thomas, acting out of duty and resisting Emily's every blandishment.  To the credit of both, neither tries to turn Aimee against the other.  Chris Cooper is excellent too, as are Benno Fuhrmann as Werner (the young man who lost his lover), Ronnie Barker as the old General, Timothy Spall as Emily's friend and business manager, and in a cameo, Giancarlo Giannini, as the police inspector who is seeking to get at what lies behind the explosion.  By the end, we know  -- but it's the Cooper-Smith dynamic that holds our attention throughout.",1467849600,,2374,4.754257907542579

Nevertheless, it's a good movie because of the Italian scenery. I have family in that region and hopefully one day I hope to go there. For now, I rely on movies.

I am trying to be honest. The story itself is actually quite emotional and endearing. The problem was with the continuity and the flashbacks/dreams. Once I figured out what was a flashback, I figured things out. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. I think it's definitely worth watching.

1918813,5,B0000CE684,The movie starts like a pleasant drama with a group of strangers sharing a train compartment until a bomb explodes in the cabin and only 4 survive.  One of those is Maggie Smith and she owns a large home in Umbria.  When the four survivors are released from the hospital she invites all of them to recuperate at her villa.  Getting to know each of the survivors is the core of the movie and it unfolds deliciously.  Beautiful Italian scenery and great performances by the actors.

1918858,5,B0000CE684,"Maggie Smith is delightful as Emily Delahunty, an aging woman with a wonderful house in the Umbria region of Italy.  She travels to the big city on a shopping tour, when a bomb (of all things) explodes in the compartment she shares with an American family, a German couple, and an older gentleman.  The survivors are taken to the same hospital for treatment.  They all seem to recover about the same time, surprisingly, and she offers to put them up in her house.

Mrs. Delahunty has been leading a somewhat lonely life, writing romance novels, though writing has become more difficult for her of late.  In any case, she blossoms with this ragged band of wounded ones who share little in common, except a need to forge a new life.

I enjoyed this film and recommend it for a pleasant stay.  The scenery is gorgeous, the house is welcoming, and Mrs. Delahunty seems to have a knack for knowing things that are about to happen, as well as being able to see things beneath the surface.

The DVD looks terrfific, it's touching, and Maggie Smith in a rare contemporary role is just wonderful. And she looks terrific too. It's a pity some people who've seen it take such perverse pleasure in revealing the entire story to those people who haven't, but I suppose there's little to be done. A good review of a film shouldn't reveal anything of the story, just what that person thinks of the film. Made for television, the distributors thought it was good enough for a cinema release and it was. Where I live it ran for nearly nine months. It's very funny, moving, has real depth and personally I don't know anyone who doesn't like it. This is one of those films you can rewatch, and still get enormous pleasure from it.

1918890,5,B0000CE684,"Great story.  The young girl is inspired casting.  And with Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall and others, a wonderful film of tragic loss and recovery among strangers who become friends and then family.  No easy answers, but the tone of the movie is that we heal when we help each other.  Some offbeat characterizations which are real and universal.  You wonder in the beginning how can these wounded people (from wounds in their past, and recent wounds of a train bombing) go on with their lives.  There are many answers.  Highly recommended if you are interested in how people confront tough problems with life and find enough courage and solace to go on to a healed life.  I read the book (a slim novella by William Trevor) and found it terribly depressing as it does not have the resolution that this film has.  A serious story--how can this ever be put on film?  The director Richard Loncraine understood the story and the characters, and filmed a satisfying resolution.  He also directed a modern dress film Richard III starring Ian McKellen --well worth viewing as a film study of the corruption of power.  Both of these films show insight into the human condition with no pat solutions.",1405209600,,1191,4.728155339805825

It is set in Italy and the scenary is just gorgeous! Maggie Smith plays a romance novelist who takes a shopping trip to Milan once a month. While on the train their small compartment explodes. She along with three others survive the bomb blast which is believed to be a terrorist attack. After being discharged from the hospital she invites her fellow travellers to come and stay with her to rest and recoop. As they are not allowed to leave Italy until the investigation is completed they agree. One is a little girl whose parents were killed in the blast. Do not be put off by this! It is a wonderful tale of how even in the darkest of times love and friendship can grow between strangers from different parts of the world.

There is a dark twist at the end as in who is responsible for the bomb but I would spoil it to mention that. It ends on a good note with the Latin phrase ""Carpe diem"" Seize the moment, forgive the past, tomorrow is uncertain but be happy in the now. I totally loved this movie and highly recommend it.",1396310400,,1245,4.226890756302521

1918932,5,B0000CE684,"Are there really flaws in this plot as some reviews suggest? There is far more to this film than meets the eye and it should not be taken at face value.

The Emily portrayed at the beginning of this movie is far from the truth: her isolation, despair and self-removal from society are cleverly given away as the camera focuses on rusty gates and a scruffy garden as her car enters the grounds of her property and in many other ways too. You could also argue that she is like Mrs Haversham in 'Great Expectations' - locked herself away from the world. This is all happening inside the head of a 'trashy novelist' (a schizophrenic and alcoholic) who has hidden herself away in Umbria. Emily is seriously truamatised by her childhood - Amy IS Emily. The detective is only present when she or Quinty are. Ask yourself why the detective never visits any of the other victims? Ask yourself why no one is ever around when he visits Emily? Why did the German have to escape? Why doesn't the detective pursue him? What does her garden represent? What does the country garden represent? She lives with Quinty (who she 'saved') in Umbria and in the film, they never even leave the house: there never was a train. Emily has created all the characters. There is so much more that is cleverly hidden in this wonderful movie: it is utterly brilliant! Look deeper into Emily's imagination and the characters of her past and you will see the story as genius and deeply meaningful. Wonderfully acted by all the characters and the scenery is stunning.",1367193600,4,1532,4.611721611721611

She turns terrible train tragedy into a wonderful, healing time for her fellow passengers, they in turn all become friends.
No one else could have pulled off this plot, so successfully. Her clothes, the scenary, the  wild flowers, and she has met her match with Mr. Chris Cooper.

He's so jerky, selfish and so handsome, all at the same time. He is wonderful in this!!!!  What a great, great under-rated actor. His brusque, demeaning manner and his obnoxious wife...uck! What a drip, she is!

Of course, the audience never, ever meets, the ""real, Francine""...we only see  her through Maggie's eyes....

Professor - Chris Cooper, does nothing in this film to help us, (the audience) understand why he loves ""Carpenter Ants""? Or drippy, Francine???

He's so stoic, handsome and nasty, but she holds tight, she gets what she wants in the end. He has never met a woman like Ms. Maggie Smith, before.

1918968,5,B0000CE684,"I didn't do any research of this movie, but it seems like something out of a geat novel- only highly condensed, though quite a good movie, nonetheless!
It would seem that Maggie Smith's character is supposed to be what this story revolves around, but really it seems that the charm and fate of the little girl, Aimee, (played by Emmy Clarke), is every bit as captivating as Maggie and all the other characters combined, if not more so!
The idea of a group of total strangers ending up together as a result of a terrorist bomb in a single train compartment is fascinating, and draws you in, though (without giving anything away), the eventual person centered upon as the prime suspect leads to some confusion. However, there are plenty of interesting things going on as the little group become closer, living in the large old home of Maggie Smith's character, (ex Harlequin Romance-style novelist, Emily Delahunty) in the beautiful Italian countryside. Things become even more interesting when Aimee's humourless and arrogant uncle arrives to take the unwilling Aimee back to the U.S., away from her new ""family"".",1315008000,,1112,4.951871657754011

1918972,4,B0000CE684,"Yes, this is an enjoyable movie but unfortunately the screenplay plot has a huge problem. As long as you disregard the problem then you can lose yourself in the sentimental fantasy, which is enhanced by superb acting, directing and cinematography. Maggie Smith, as the lead character Emily Delahunty, won an Emmy for her performance in this television movie.

But, all the other Amazon reviewers overlook the problem with this supposedly wonderful story: the Italian police would never give an 8-year old girl to strangers especially a girl who is catatonic from an bomb which killed her parents while they were on a train in Italy.

So, the entire story is nonsense. Maggie Smith plays a benevolent British expatriate romance novel writer living in Italy who is making her monthly pilgrimmage to the big city and just happens to sit in a train compartment where a bomb accidentally explodes. She offers the survivors including the bomber, refuge in her gorgeous Italian villa, which of course they all accept.

Then, the big conflict develops when the uncle of Aimee, the 8-year old girl, arrives from the United States to take her to his home. He is tense, supercilious, egotistical and generally repugnant plus, repulsed by Maggie who is playing Emily Delahunty, who before before becoming a novelist was a wandering hippy.

There are a bunch of subplots about the supporting characters including the young German bomber who forsakes his political cause to protect Aimee.

This is a well-crafted film with many enjoyable scenes but I doubt that anyone under 35 years old will watch because most of the main characters are old people reliving their lives and seeking salvation through a young, catatonic girl. Also, the story slowly unfolds like life in Umbria. This is not an action film or trendy romantic comedy. In reality it is a story about old people seeking redemption for mistakes made earlier in life.

I think it is popular because many people, especially older women, would like an opportunity to do something noble before they die. Unfortunately, the story is fantasy and this is just another feel-good film which is simply amusement and has little or no relationship to reality.",1305676800,,2194,5.013736263736264

1918975,4,B0000CE684,As always Maggie Smith plays  her role perfectly in this little gem of a movie. She is a somewhat retired author who wrote quasi romance novels and now lives comfortably in a lovely villa somewhere in Italy. The story of life unfolds when she heads off in a train to an Italian city. While she sits in the car several pessangers also come in to sit. Maggie in her old occupational way trys to figure who they are and where they come from. With that the trip is ended when a bomb explodes. When she come to in hospital she finds out that of the other passengers in her car a couple were killed. the remaining are hospitalized and need help to recoperate. Thats when she volunteers her large villa to the passangers in her car. The one that attracts her the most is a young girl -about 9/10 who still is tramutized by the loss of her parents. The others appreciate her thouoghtfulness. The rest of movie you most see as it slowly comes into a mystery. Won't give it alll away but there is a somewhat happy ending.,1286841600,,1011,4.321052631578947
1918976,4,B0000CE684,"I have to give this movie a very mixed review. On the one hand, the storyline, the script, the score and the acting are fairly reliably horrendous throughout. The storyline is weak, choppy, and drags on miserably. The characters are not very likable (to put it mildly...), and even the most gifted ones (Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall, Chris Cooper and Giancarlo Giannini) are effectively dragged down and their abilities trampled by the leaden script and the absolute lack of talent of some of the other actors. In particular, Bernard Furmann turns in a devastatingly feeble performance that makes you wonder if he's ever darkened the doorstep of an acting school.

However, on the other hand, the Italian scenery, that wonderful house, with its beautiful garden and setting, and the cinematography are beyond amazingly gorgeous - all of them. As such, I have now seen this movie at least half a dozen times in the past few months, trying to ignore the fallow storyline and the lame acting, and am quite determined to retire in that region of Italy and, preferably, in that very house.

Take from that what you will....",1282694400,2,1117,4.873684210526315
1918977,4,B0000CE684,"I'm tempted to rate the film five stars but after reading some of the more negative reviews I can see some of their points.

On the plus side, this is an interesting story that avoids a lot of cliches of most films.  Emily Delahonty, as played masterfully by Maggie Smith, is an older Englishwoman who seems to be exceptionally warm hearted, wise and generous. As the story unfolds we learn that she had a terrible childhood and her adult life seems to have been colorful but not entirely happy.  Still she has done well writing romance novels and maintains a glorious home in Umbria. She tries to avoid the unhappy side of life with her novels that have happy endings and generous amounts of grappa.

When she and others are wounded in a freak train explosion she invites the survivors to her home to rest and heal.  She is obviously lonely and needs them as much as she gives them.  The chief recipient of this love is a child, played by a beautiful young actress, who wins the hearts of everyone, including the servants.  Each of the survivors has lost a close family member, apparently, and so they reconnect here, since they are prohibited to leave the country, and find a new kind of family.

I found the story fascinating and the beautiful way they helped each other, most noticably by building an English country garden for Emily, was quite moving. What did bother me towards the end was the way Emily seemed to pursue the American uncle of the girl, who had come to take her back to the States.  Perhaps the novel made this aspect of Emily's character more plausible but in the film, it is strange and jarring to see her descend from being an altruistic, kind woman into something sad and pathetic.  It is understandable, given her unfortunate background, but there is nothing in the early part of the film that really hints at this weakness and makes her later actions credible.

Still, the excellent performances by the whole cast and the gorgeous scenery enhance an interesting story and make this a film worth seeing.",1277424000,,2030,4.626740947075209

The characters are all thrown together after a tradgic accident on a train or was it not an accident?  The surviving travelers become the guests of Ms. Smith at her lavish home in Umbria. Giving more detail would only spoil viewing this film.

If you are a Maggie Smith fan, you'll love this movie.  If you aren't particularly a fan, you may become one.

Don't look for gore, blood or wild races around the winding roads.  Look for a glamorous Ms. Smith in a sensational home with cocktails at 9 A.M.

1918980,5,B0000CE684,"Maggie Smith pulls this whole movie together.  I have loved this movie for years and finally purchased it at Amazon.  Maggie plays an older woman who lives in a beautiful old villa in Umbria, Italy. The story begins as she travels to Milan for her monthly shopping trip.  She sits in a compartment with around 9 other people until a bomb explodes and kills everyone in the compartment except a little American girl, an old Englishman, a young German man, and her.  While the police are investigating the bombing, the partially recovered travelers go to stay with Maggie's character, Mrs. De La Hanti.  The little girl arrives mute, unable to speak because of the trauma of losing her parents in the attack.  The German lost his girlfriend and the use of his right hand and the Englishman is grieving for his daughter who died.  As the film progresses, you see that Giancarlo Gianini is the investigating policeman and Mrs. De La Hanti is an ex-patriot English romance writer who has been abused in her past.  This group of strangers becomes a family of sorts in a matter of weeks and their secrets are uncovered as they begin to understand each other.

I love Maggie Smith's character: vulnerable, flamboyant, abused, and yet able to see the beauty in other people.  She has an innocence and imagination that is almost child-like.  She is the author of many romance novels and sees stories in the human interactions she observes, interpreting them with an amazing understanding of human nature.

Every expression on Maggie Smith's face reveals a different aspect of her character, and Ronnie Barker's straight perfomance (as opposed to his usual comedy) is perfect. The scenery is luxurious - the image of the meal on the terrace on a summer evening is one to brighten even the coldest of winter days! The story itself, though simple, is very touching and so many elements of it are revealed without words. Maggie Smith gently stroking the spines of her books and talking of them, unaware that the man to whom she was speaking has left the room is so poignant. It's a truly feel-good film with excellent actors and glorious settings!

1918993,5,B0000CE684,"What a wonderful picture!

Telling an intriguing, nuances story isn't easy; it takes genuine talent  and artistic commitment on both sides of the camera.

That commitment to quality comes through loud and clear in listening to the voiceove commentary by the film's director and producer.  For them the project was obviously a labor of love.

Some voiceover commentaries are rather flat and self-indulgent; but this one is, in its own way, as good as the movie itself!

The movie includes some of the finest ensemble actors around.  The script is economical, lyrical and tightly-written; the casting is spot-on; and the overall mood and ambience of the film speaks movingly to the human condition.

This is the kind of movie that when you're watching it you think of it as ""a-movie-that-can-just-as-easily-be-a-play.""  However, often the  pitfall with those kinds of movies is that the movie becomes too staged, too ""presentational.""  But that's not the case here at all.  Filmed, for the most part, on location in Italy, the movie takes full advantage of its naturalistic setting.

The movie indicates no specific historical period; but rather springs as much from ""inside the head"" of the Maggie Smith character as it does from the objective reality of the dialogue.

All this requires a clutch performance by Maggie Smith.  But, then again, Maggie Smith is *always* superb.  I think of her as the Lou Gehrig, the Iron Horse of acting wizardry.  Her presence on screen is magical.  There are few actors who guarantee that the movie they're in is worth watching. Maggie Smith is one of them.  She knocks in every runner on base.

Her scenes with Chris Cooper should be mandatory viewing for every film student, behind and in front of the camera.

Sure, the film has its flaws; but compare this ""little gem of a movie"" to the standard bill of fare filmmakers regularly and grindingly produces.

Maggie's character, Emily, drinks quite a bit and does push drinks on the character played by Chris Cooper, the little girl's uncle.  This bothered me because it seemed so overdone.  But then, it reminded me of someone, a personal friend who used to do the same thing.  Emily's purpose in her life is to heal, not only the victims of the train explosion - but, at the same time, to heal herself.  There are a few black and white flashbacks that are easy to miss, showing abusive sex, presumeably, Emily being abused - its not explicit, but implicit.

Mrs. Delahunty is an elderly, romance novelist & alcoholic with a mysterious past whom owns a home in the Italian countryside of Umbria. She wears her heart on her sleeve & goes out of her way to feel needed and wanted by people around her... Mrs. Delahunty has a kind, generous heart & simply wants the best for those she meets.

We learn this all about Mrs. Delahunty as the story unfolds as Mrs. Delahunty & others she meets on the train are all aboard the train when a bomb causes major damage to the train and injury to those aboard. Mrs. Delahunty invites those that were sharing the train cabin she was in to recuperate at her home in Umbria. They take up her offer and all become friends. The youngest member of the group, a girl, lost her parents in the train bombing and an Uncle she's never met comes from the US to take her home. It doesn't appear that the Uncle isn't all that interested in taking care of her.... So, Mrs. Delahunty sets about trying to persuade the Uncle to come to another alternative.... The two do not see eye to eye on many levels, so we are left to see what will happen to the girl.... Plus the other guests, as we learn they all have their own personal lives to attend to as well.

1918998,4,B0000CE684,"Emily Delahunty has acquired four guests in her cosy Italian country mansion. She's revelling in the intimacy, eagerly dropping beads about her adventurous past; although now, it seems, she has settled here in the groves of Umbria as an author of romance paperbacks with titles such as ""Two on a Sunbeam.""

When she's splitting peas in the solid, vintage kitchen with Werner she is sincere and caring. With Thomas Riversmith, a university professor who studies the red carpenter ant, Emily is begging for jungle romance. Confiding unabashedly, she holds back nothing from her twirly past. The disgusted Tom shrinks from her almost body to body conversations and regards her love books as trash for the desperate. While she fancies that they might be courting an affair, Tom fears her boldness, looking forward to returning to America with his niece Aimee. Wickedly she smiles: ""A few weeks with the right woman and all his little irritations would soon disappear.""

""What Mrs. Emily Delahunty requires is a faucet of passion. Sloshing her grappa around the old world Umbrian mansion she speaks of her memories--an obliterated childhood; of numerous, disappointing men and a vanished youth in the Cafe Rose where she was obliged to entertain sweaty gentlemen.

Tom will return to America with Aimee in the morning. Needing to be a mother to the child of sunlight, Emily is in a restless fever. With two glasses and a bottle of grappa, she wakes him, her satin dressing gown flowing open. Again he is annoyed with her. Her sad face beseeches him: ""It's unkind to call me Mrs. Delahunty, Tom. It's not even my real name."" Though decidedly drunk, Emily exposes his guilt with wisdom then splashes grappa over his pajamas.

The writer of ""bodice-rippers"" triumphs and the novel of her Umbrian life ends with:

1918999,3,B0000CE684,"""My House in Umbria,"" released by HBO Studios in 2003 certainly walks like a chick flick and talks like a chick flick.  It's set in the beautiful Umbrian countryside of Italy, thereby strongly resembling chick flicks set in Tuscany, or Provence, or wherever.  And it stars the magnifico Dame Maggie Smith, who can carry any movie, let alone a chick flick, on her own.

Smith plays Mrs. Emily Delahunty, nicely-fixed English romance novelist, passing her life in the peaceful Umbrian countryside, with an overcooked outfit for every day of the week.  However, she takes the train into Milan monthly to shop.  As the picture opens, she's just catching that train, getting acquainted with her compartment mates.  But a bomb shatters the peace, and when the smoke's cleared, each of her compartment mates has lost their nearest and dearest.  An elderly English general, played by noted comedian Ronnie Barker, has lost his only child, a daughter, and his son-in-law.  The young German, Werner, has lost his girlfriend.  And the child, Aimee, has lost her mother and father.  So, after the hospital releases them all on the same day, Mrs. Delahunty scoops them all up and takes them to her villa to recover, in mind and body.  Former heart throb Giancarlo Giannini plays the Italian police detective who comes around now and then investigating the bomb.  Timothy Spall plays Mrs. Delehunty's reliable Man Friday.  And Chris Cooper plays Aimee's uncle, estranged since before her birth from his sister: he's a puritanical academic.  (Do they really make such people?  I've sure never met one).

So, aside from the fact that the movie opens with a spurt of bloody violence, how else does it differ from your average chick flick?  To begin with, it's based on a novella by William Trevor, an admired Irish author resident in England.  His work is mysterious, threatening; never soothing.  The telescript is by well-known playwright Hugh Whitemore, distinctly high-brow; doubt that he's ever written anything even slightly chicky.  And let's look at the film itself.  Mrs. Delehunty is the product of an abused childhood, nor was her young adulthood any too healthy.  She drinks quite a bit, as the English sometimes do, morning, noon and night, as it happens.  (Some of what she does might not have been done by a sober woman.) And her (always charming) drunkenness does upset Aimee's supposedly straight-laced uncle. Well, really.  But the movie does come with a happy tear-jerker of an ending.  Still, is it a chick flick?  Not entirely.",1187049600,3,2531,4.9952153110047846

What appears to be a senseless act of terrorism aboard a train turns into an unraveling of the buried  years of heartache,abuse and lack of true love of one Emily Delahunty (though she admits that even this is not her true name).Maggie Smith brings this character to full passionate life and awareness. Emily,for some reason,is at her very best in life when she is caring for others. She is unexpectedly put into this position when a bomb explodes in her train car leaving only herself and three other survivors. Emily has been a writer of ""bodice-rippers"" and has published many of these fantastical romance novels under many nom-de-plumes. What she encounters in the months of recovery with these three survivors at her villa in Umbria,as well as the continuous nightdreams she has, set her up for the biggest and most important discoveries long buried in her own past.

One of the many nice things about her is that she has allowed herself to age naturally and gracefully, none of this facial makeover-business that make so many Hollywood eldsters look so ridiculous and pathetic.  Maggie gives nobility to aging and is not ashamed to be seen under less than galmorous conditions.

That aside, I expected ""My House In Umbria"" to be more light-hearted than it was. Something about the title made me think that, I guess. Anyway, it was darker than I had anticipated, but that's not a complaint.  It delved into real human issues (what happens to people after violence and death unexpectedly invade their lives).  However, it avoids doing it in any really deep way, for better or worse.  Some of the events that take place (don't read further if you haven't seen the film yet!!) seem unlikely:  Why, for instance, would the German youth stay at her house so long, or at all for that matter, considering what he had done?  Still, it's a touching film, one worth seeing for the humanity it contains.",1143504000,34,1146,4.781725888324873

1919013,2,B0000CE684,"This is a deeply sick film.  The heroine, played by Maggie Smith, is older, has been sexually abused throughout her life, and is now the author of trashy books.  On a train an explosion rips through her compartment, miraculously saving some and killing others.  (Maggie's  severe facial wounds heal apparently within days, leaving no scars.)  Three survivors, including a little girl, come to live in the Italian villa owned by the heroine.  Then the girl's uncle comes to take away the psychologically damaged waif to America.  The story then grows intensely dark and unappealing, as the heroine drowns herself in alcohol and the American turns out to be an utterly repulsive and insensitive jerk.  What a waste of Maggie Smith's great talent.  HBO was the perfect place for this film.  IFC should soon run it.",1136851200,10,811,4.940740740740741
1919014,4,B0000CE684,"Perhaps I wouldn't have liked it as much if I wasn't so fond of Italy.

Its plot revolves around an explosion in a train car. The survivors of the accident are invited to stay in another of the survivor's homes... a house in Umbria, surprisingly enough. The owner of the house is a older British woman (Maggie Smith) who's a bodice-ripper writer and she's always writing a story in her head. When someone speaks to her, she thinks of it as dialogue and acts out her life the way someone in one of her novels would act.

I especially enjoyed, quite nostalgically, the bit where the group travelled to Siena and sat for a while on the steps in front of the Duomo.

I wouldn't buy it, because I'm not sure it would stand up to many viewings, but it's surely worth seeing once or twice.",1134518400,2,782,4.342465753424658
1919015,5,B0000CE684,"I must say that I have always been drawn to well seasoned actors/actresses such as Maggie Smiths and Giancarlo Giannini. Their performances were thrilling...the storyline was great but many of the lines, including Smith's, came across as corny rather than poetic.

1919017,4,B0000CE684,"While this is a made-for-TV film, the cast--headed by English charmer Maggie Smith--is excellent. The subject, a group of survivors recovering (at an Italian villa) from a terrorist attack on a train, is relevant these days. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes mature films, foreign films, art films. Humor and drama, some surprises--like who is the terrorist?",1126569600,2,361,5.241379310344827
1919018,1,B0000CE684,"Let's get the good bits over and done with. Yes, the Umbrian countryside looks wonderful. Maggie Smith is, as she almost always is, fabulous. She is given a role that has small potential as a character and an erratic and inconsistent script, yet she manages to make it seem almost plausible. Few others could have done the same with such poor material.

After a promising start the film spirals out of control after only a couple of scenes. Much of the plot is completely implausible: a modern Italian hospital discharges an orphaned girl to the care of complete strangers; a well-off, middle-class American Professor and his wife seriously discuss putting a child into care merely because she has suffered a bereavement (ever heard of CBT?); the young girl walks around modern Italy dressed as if she has just stepped out of the 1930s (not a pair of jeans in sight); and the twist at the end is just embarrasing.

Poor old Timothy Spall (usually excellent) struggles with an Irish accent and his relationship with the maid is not developed at all; it is a completely pointless element of the film. Ronnie Barker is surprisngly good, but only has a handful of bland lines to deliver.

Overall a wandering, nebulous, unconvincing and dull film. Avoid.",1124668800,27,1250,4.831775700934579
1919019,1,B0000CE684,"I couldn't agree more with a previous assessment of this film as a poor imitation of 'Enchanted April'. A small example: Does it not tell you something that the same actor (Anna Longhi) reprised her 'Enchanted April' role in 'Umbria'?

1919020,1,B0000CE684,"This movie is a CHEAP knock-off of Enchanted April.  Enchanted April is an uplifting, feel-good movie, one of our favorites.  ""My House.."" has its moments, but for the most part has some VERY DARK undercurrents and images that cast a pall over the entire movie.  It leaves you feeling depressed and icky!  It is like the EVIL TWIN to Enchanted April which I highly recommend to men as well as Chicks!  Guys will love Enchanted April.  Shame on My House in Umbria for such a sordid copy catting of Enchanted April.",1109721600,17,513,4.582417582417582
1919021,5,B0000CE684,"Writer Alan Bennett has been quoted as saying that we're ""lucky to be living in her time.""  He was talking about Maggie Smith.

Bennett's observation seems a tad bittersweet.  Yes, we're lucky to be living in her time because she's fabulous, but also because, unless we happen to catch her live on the West End stage, we aren't likely to see her in much of a leading part, ever.  In fact, the noteworthy films in which this two-time Oscar winner has played the principal role basically consist of this made-for-HBO endeavor and *The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie* (1969).

The upshot is that *My House in Umbria* has a tremendous weight to bear--that of a legendary actress's best screen vehicle in thirty-five years.  It seems a little unfair to judge it based on whether it's worthy of such a distinction, and I can't help wondering whether this accounts for some of this rather plotless film's, shall we say, generous critical reviews.

Still, the more times I see it--and it speaks volumes when I'm able to watch a movie more than once--the more I appreciate its leisurely, picturesque style, and the more uplifted I feel by its timely and refreshing theme: that of injured survivors being ""set free"" by their enjoyment of nature and each other.

And, ultimately, I begin to think of this movie as a vehicle worthy of its star, and as one in the recent string of high-quality HBO films that have been so good I've almost wanted to send the company a fan letter.  Go, HBO.",1108771200,99,1471,4.648648648648648
1919022,4,B0000CE684,"""My House In Umbria"" is a beautifully filmed, well-written, and wonderfully acted film.  Is it original in its plot?  Not really.  Is it exceptional in every way?  No.  There is one element that lifts this film above the norm: Maggie Smith.  Dame Maggie is always brilliant, but in ""My House In Umbria"", she is positively radiant, mesmerizing, and completely unforgettable.  Every nuance, every thought of her character shows on her exquisitely expressive face.  If you are a fan of great acting, you love Maggie Smith already.  This is one of her greatest roles on film.  She makes this a must-see.",1105488000,6,599,4.9
1919023,5,B0000CE684,"I rented this film, because I wanted to see Maggie Smith's performance, and the landscapes. I wasn't expecting it to touch me, and I assumed it to be a light comedy like Under The Tuscan Sun Or Tea With Musolini kind of films. It's a simple story of unconditional love and dealing with ones demons and shadows from the past. Maggie Smith did a great job at revealing her character's inner layers and I was very simpathetic towards her, and understood why she was so eccentric and self-absorbing. She's misunderstood by most people except the little girl whom she had connected to in many ways. Ultimately, she uses all her life experiences and pain and the people around her as material for her novels. It's amazing to realize that her character is a real survivor of hardship and struggle. By the time Chris Cooper resent the little girl back to Maggie Smith to live with her in Umbria, the joy and happiness finally eclipsed the past. It was wonderful to see Smith in a wonderful role so opposite from her super-snob role in Gosford Park. I was so touched by the ending scene, and I think this is going to be one of my all time favorite Maggie Smith films.",1097452800,17,1158,4.519047619047619
