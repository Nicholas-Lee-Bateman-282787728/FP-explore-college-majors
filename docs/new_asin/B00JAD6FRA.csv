6351356,2,B00JAD6FRA,I'm very saddened by this DVD I bought it with a gift card I had received for Christmas and out of watching the DVDs I am NOT able to even stay awake for an hour. The documentaries are completely boring. I was expecting something a lot better for something that sounded so amazing. I should have paid attention to the reviews more when I saw that a lot of people had the same reaction.,1455148800,2,385,4.216216216216216
6351357,3,B00JAD6FRA,"It was ok. The spree killer/serial killer DVDs are somewhat lame, but the mysteries portion was well enough.",1454889600,,108,5.055555555555555

6351360,5,B00JAD6FRA,Bought this for my Partner...He works in Law and loves to get inside of the criminal minds of people to see what makes them tick the way that they do....He LOVES these,1450569600,,167,4.25
6351361,1,B00JAD6FRA,My mistake I should've read the reviews before I  purchased it. This was so poorly put together I couldn't even get through the first disc.,1437609600,8,139,4.56
6351362,1,B00JAD6FRA,"This is the single most amateurish pile of video crud I've ever encountered. Worse: Its content not only loops multiple portions of the preceding episodes multiple times, the first episode is little more than a painfully sustained kindergarten-level psychological critique of a Jack-the-Ripper film. I don't exaggerate. It's worse even: While reading words attributed to Albert Fish the insipid voice of the ""narrator"" sounds like a giggling fourteen-year-old masturbating. If you need to work off bad karma or shorten time in purgatory, perhaps consider it. It's even worse if you can imagine: If you view ""Killers Among Us: Portraits in Evil"", you may find a one-hundred percent duplication of one video set in the other. As we said in the seventies, ""Gag me with a spoon and barf me out the door!"" Buy or view at your peril.",1433289600,10,827,5.0
6351363,5,B00JAD6FRA,Very educational. Thank you for your prompt delivery.,1425427200,,53,5.75

6351365,1,B00JAD6FRA,"Complete rip off.
I have never come across a ""documentary"" that has gone so far (6 disc) to provide so little.  The repetition of scenes and interviews with ""experts"" fumbling along is nauseating.  But they had to do this because this is a low budget regurgitation of news clippings padding by shallow commentary filled with inaccuracies.  The narration painfully drags along in order to fill each disc.
Ever bought a big bag of potato chips that only had one chip in it........here you go.
It is a trick, bordering on fraud.",1401926400,17,525,4.747252747252747

8649296,1,B00JAD6FRA,Worst documentary show. Mostly shows clips of movies related to the killer but not really accurate. Hard to take seriously. Mixes up details. Just poorly done.,1503100800,,159,5.153846153846154

8649298,1,B00JAD6FRA,"This is a boring series.  When they ran out of ""real footage"" they substituted it with clips from old movies.  Not a good series at all.",1498953600,2,136,4.1923076923076925
