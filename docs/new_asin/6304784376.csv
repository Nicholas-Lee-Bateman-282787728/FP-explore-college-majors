921715,4,6304784376,"This is an OK Ernest movie, but it is not as great as Ernest Goes to Jail  or Ernest Saves Christmas, and not as dissapointing as Slam Dunk Ernest.",965606400,,147,4.068965517241379
921716,2,6304784376,"This Ernest movie will be a disappointment for those expecting more of Varney's comic genius.  It is not on the same level of his earlier films.  The plot is too wild, and the characters are too wooden.  But it does  contain some hilarious scenes.  One involves Sticky, Sticky, Gummy Toads  and a high ranking general.  You can guess what happens. Overall, this film  lacks the vintage Ernest most people expect.",948499200,,412,4.785714285714286
921717,4,6304784376,"This video offered some of Earnest's best comedy scenes both having to do with food.  The interspersion of a t.v. news show host reporting on the progress of the army in which Earnest is enlisted made it more interesting.  This is one of my family's favorites as we can laugh and not be insulted  with language, violence, or inappropriate dress and relationships.",924912000,,363,4.82258064516129

921862,4,6304784376,"Yeah the Ernest movies can be very stupid but I like them. You know what to expect before you start to watch so if you hate it don't watch it. They allow someone to just let go and enjoy stupid, inane plots with all's well that ends well endings. Ernest is always a loveable, well meaning oaf who complicates every thing but manages to get things to come out well. Playing reservist water boys who are activated and sent to some desert in some who knows where, apparently Arab country, they screw everything up but paint the target for the jets at the end.",1373760000,,556,4.355769230769231

Did not check the disk to see about and not wrap around it and not sealed .",1323388800,,199,3.4444444444444446
921929,1,6304784376,Should have known better.  The first Ernest was too much.  Now this is how many redo's later?  Glad I didn't pay for it.,1320278400,,120,4.130434782608695
921930,1,6304784376,"We're about half way in to watching this little dud on Video on Demand and my 11 yr. old daughter and 8 yr. old son - both of whom LOVE slapstick and laughed all the way through Ernest Saves Christmas - asked if they could go do something else.

This movie is quite stupid and not at all in the same vein as earlier Ernest films (Ernest Goes to Camp, etc.)  I'm not looking for high-minded comedy (it IS, after all, a goofy franchise!) but this movie is a completer disappointment.

Not recommended.",1292803200,,499,4.344086021505376
921931,5,6304784376,let me just say this movie is too funy for words. i love this film i recomend it for everyone. jim varney is the bomb. :),1260057600,,121,3.6923076923076925

921933,4,6304784376,"This is another example of Ernest being is comical self. This movie is not the best of the series, but it is still really funny.",1042675200,4,128,4.16
921934,4,6304784376,"This movie finds Ernest as a ball retriever at a driving range with aspirations of driving army trucks like real army people.  His buddy assures him that if he joins the reserves, he can party every weekend while driving the big green trucks.  So Ernest joins up.  But coincidentally, his unit suddenly gets called up and sent to the Persian Gulf as peace keepers monitoring a border dispute.  The border dispute goes rapidly out of control, and Ernest winds up on the front lines.  The fate of the civilized world is in his hands!
Given the theme, it's not surprising that this movie is a bit more violent than Ernest's standard kids' fare.  Guns actually get fired (but not by Ernest) and people fall down.  If you are familiar with the Middle East or the army, you will find lots to laugh at in this movie.  However, the overall plot almost comes across as too real these days to be as preposterous as it was originally intended.",1027987200,9,932,4.538922155688622
921935,4,6304784376,"This movie is right up there with the best of the Ernest movies. Varney is in top form as Ernest, and there's a great mix of other characters, too. The humor is quite witty, with the usual mixture of silliness and sophistication.",1000080000,6,229,4.476190476190476

7876967,5,6304784376,"Ernest P. Worrell ""got milk"" (Jim Varney) is a skilled and innovative ball retriever at the local golf course. His one wish is to drive exotic military vehicles like the GMC Napa Sonoma 3000. The only way he can do this is to join the reserves.

Mean while on the other side of the world in Karifistan there is a legend of a great warrior who will free the oppressed people from the tyrant Tuti Tufuti.

Due to an unscrupulous UN Col. Pierre Gullet (David Mller) their paths may cross. And there is a quasi love interest with the reporter Cindy Swanson (Hayley Tyson.)

Although the story line may not have quite the stature of many of the other Ernest P. Worrell movies, Jim Varney is at his best.",1506038400,2,698,4.395348837209302
