8276934,2,B001AD1NEI,The storyline was way too simplistic and the acting was unrealistic. I feel this should be offered as a $0.00 item to view.,1354233600,,123,4.391304347826087
8276935,3,B001AD1NEI,"A nice little twist movie with the begining and end working well. While parts of the middle section drag going on and seemingly ever on. Michael Gough is always at least interesting. But not so much when playing,as he is here,the hero. Not happy with the quality of the print or sound either. At best both are only OK.This is of course a rare and hard to see picture. I rather wish I hadn't tried so hard.",1344297600,,405,4.2727272727272725
8276936,3,B001AD1NEI,"The House in the Woods is a little gem I found by accident. It stars Michael Gough, The lovely Patricia Roc and Ronald Howard who was the son of the great Leslie Howard. I've always loved British thrillers and this one suits me perfect. *SPOILERS* The story involves a couple moving to the country. Mr Gough who plays the husband is a writer and can't seem to get the peace and quiet he needs where they live. Their flat neighbors are always having these loud drunken parties and seem to have no problem barging into Mr. Gough and Ms Rocs flat at any given time. Ronald Howard is the owner of the *House in the Woods* that the couple ends up renting. Mr. Howard who favors his father although much more handsome imo plays a brooding melancholy painter who lives alone after the death of his wife. The secret the couple find out I won't spoil for you. This is one of those never seen films that is a treat on a rainy sunday with popcorn. This film was cheaply made and is in b/w but thats one of the reasons I find it appealing. Watch and decide for yourself.",1238025600,18,1058,4.295
