8289631,5,B001CU7VBI,"To my knowledge this is the ONLY documentary on the Son Tay prison raid, a special operations mission into North Vietnam in 1970 designed to liberate American POWs outside of Hanoi.  The mission ultimately failed to recover any POWs, but the planning, execution and audacity make it legendary.  The documentary also feature Senator McCain commenting on his memories of seeing the raid go down on the horizon while he himself was a POW in Hanoi, as well as those regarding his father, who was the CINCPAC at the time.

A Great deal for a great documentary, also at roughly half the price of buying it on History.com",1398038400,,614,4.719626168224299
