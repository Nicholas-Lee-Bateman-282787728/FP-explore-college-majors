7545032,5,B018ELUD6W,"All Hell Breaks Loose is an alcohol soaked, foot on the gas blast. The story opens with this biker gang called Satans Sinners. These satanic bikers play by their own rules and they are seeking virgins. They happen to come across three women, after killing two of them, they decide to keep the third one. From there, we see a newly married couple named Bobbie Sue and Nick on their happy day get interrupted by the gang as they leave Nick for dead and take Bobbie Sue with them to be the virgin sacrifice to Satan. These brought back to life bikers did not count on God helping out Nick to keep him alive each time they kill him, while he is trying to get back his bride. The acting and script in this film felt fresh, the premise of God helping this hopeless soul against a gang was absurd, but it worked. The scene where the gang are on bikes chasing him on foot and then Nick questions God, was genius. This film is firmly tongue in the cheek. When you have a guy in the film doing such a short bus version of Elvis Presley and you find yourself laughing, you know that someone has really created something genius.

This film has everything an exploitation fan can beg for, it has wall to wall violence. Each time the bikers kill poor Nick, it gets more and more gruesome. The humor in this film does get very dark at times, and at others it gets very odd. The beauty of this film is there is no line or boundary that this film is not afraid to cross. I would put this film with Astron 6s Father Day as such a love letter to the 70s and that style of exploitation that feels so fresh and makes fans excited about film again. This film was more fun than it had any right to be. From first reel to last, this film is just a blast. The director of this film gets it, he gets the fans and what they will expect from this film. He was daring enough to know his limitations and not go against the bigger films, but stick to his guns and create something that will make the bigger films rethink their future spending. This film is just a flat out balls to the wall piece of fun. Highly Recommended.",1457395200,6,2093,4.193548387096774
7545033,5,B018ELUD6W,Saw this film at a screening a few months back. All in all a pretty damn good flick. I appreciate the dark humor as much as the grindhouse action. 5 stars for an amazing indie flick.,1449014400,4,182,4.083333333333333
7545037,4,B018ELUD6W,"The basics of ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" is not completely original, the biker gang, innocent couple and horrorific intersection of lives is classic. What the film does offer is a fresh view of that classic in a creative and full throttled flick. I loved most of the crazy, evil characters in the biker gang, the action and humor hit on point, and the story was robust.

I have mixed emotions about the special effects. There is a hefty amount of both practical and CGI, plus Garner has an understanding of the right balance of both, I just felt the CGI gunshots and blood splatter did more to kill the good vibe of ""All Hell Breaks Loose"". However the practical gore and horror is worthy, and the grindhouse attitude and road horror feel forgive the CGI choices here.

Overall I enjoyed "" All Hell Breaks Loose"" and intend on adding it to my collection. It is a near perfect example of modern throwback to Cult Cinema. The CGI may turn off some viewers, and there is a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, but it the exploitation, gore and guts that turn me on with this one. I think most modern grindhouse fans will appreciate this homage to those glory gory days of the cult film!",1460851200,3,1173,4.502347417840376

7545040,4,B018ELUD6W,"Good for the genre. I think a lot of the negative reviews are by people who don't get the goofyy, b-movie horror style of movie. It's supposed to be kinda cheesy... I enjoyed it. Totally sexist though.",1458691200,3,201,4.45945945945946
7545041,2,B018ELUD6W,"In this genre I found ""Motorcycle Gang"" (1994) predictable, but entertaining.",1458345600,,77,6.090909090909091
7545042,5,B018ELUD6W,"This story is entirely whacked out, scratch your head kind of whacked out. Weve got a pair of newlyweds, and weve also got an aggressive, violent demon biker gang that has a tendency to turn any young lady that captures their eye into a murder victim. But on one specific night, these hoodlums pick the wrong guy. This gentleman, distraught as his wife has been kidnapped, has God on his side. Pretty much literally. And that means the evil doers are going to encounter competition far stiffer than initially prepared for. Ultimately, Bobby Sues well-being hinges on the shoulder of a complete and utter nerd. Its a good thing hes damn hard to kill

The aesthetic value, as a whole is amazing. This could have very easily been plucked from a 30 year old VHS bin. Thats strong post-production, perfect lighting and the creative mind and hands of a stellar costume designer. Garners decision to shoot in atypical fashion.

I loved the nod to Lethal Weapon, and the cheesy dialogue. There are a few great punchlines to field as the picture rolls toward a predictable but rewarding conclusion. Loose ends are tied up. Plenty of blood sprays about the sets. Its just so damn fun! If its a slow Saturday night and youve got the house to yourself, open a cold one and enjoy this groovy little comedic horror piece.",1458172800,4,1307,4.678260869565217

This movie offers a waste of celluloid and nothing else.  I was going to say talent but really, nothing about this film even hints at talent.
