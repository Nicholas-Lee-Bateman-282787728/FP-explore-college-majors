The film jumped throughout the whole thing and most of the time you couldn't hear what they were saying. There were 3 listed chapters but they were the same over and over again. Totally bummed out.",1408838400,,322,4.47457627118644
8485561,3,B000VTZY9C,I loved the senery and watching the horses move and where they went. But was disappointed to see that the 3rd vidio was the same one as the 2nd one.,1375401600,,148,3.966666666666667
8485562,5,B000VTZY9C,"I've lived in this area almost my entire life, and there are places in this DVD that I've never seen before watching this video.  If you love horseback riding videos, or just like to see the outdoors then I'd reccomend this DVD.  I hear these guys are making another DVD soon, so I can't wait to see it too!",1189209600,,307,4.186440677966102
