8679735,4,B00NQ0102S,"The uncut version of the series is the same as other releases. The only difference is the graphic violent scenes in all their uncensored splendor, and the nudity, surprisingly including full frontal male nudity, which is quite rare in most Hollywood productions.
The series is a mix of the real Borgias family and many interesting fictional stories around them.
Sadly the show ends in an abrupt fashion, finishing the plot of season 3, but leaving everything else very open and hanging in the air waiting for another season or two to end things properly.
It is a beautiful looking period piece (costumes, scenery, props, locations, etc.), provocative drama, and great performances from Jeremy Irons and the rest of the cast, but sadly cut short, perhaps due to low ratings and production costs. Hence why I give it 4 stars.

These DVDs are close captioned for the hearing impaired, but no not include subtitles in English or any other language. The boxes do include some mini postcards and loose mini flyer promos as well. All DVDs include many extras, like gag reel/bloopers, brief interviews with the director and creators and the cast.",1477526400,,1138,4.958115183246074
8679736,5,B00NQ0102S,"Didn't know there was a cut version.  This DVD has the exact version that I remember being aired on Cable.
No scratches and ran perfect. Fast delivery and packaged just right.",1465689600,,175,4.645161290322581

8679738,5,B00NQ0102S,"Assuming this series is not historical fantasy, enjoyed the eye opening story of the behind the scenes interactions amongst the power brokers of 15th Century Europe.  Such a shame the series was terminated so abruptly.",1429401600,,218,5.228571428571429
