4231292,5,B003YOXIPI,"My name is Melvin ""The American Bodyguard"" Key. I've been training in Krav Maga for about 2 years now and I must say the team that put this series of videos together is top notch.  When I say that, I mean that the ease of instruction, the attention to detail and the complete walk thru of the Krav Maga fighting spirit is captured in the videos. The instructors are knowledgeable and from what I have seen so far just about everything that you will learn from an actual Krav class from Day 1 is captured in these video. In addition to the attention to detail of the instructors, is the attention to detail from the video production team. I must say top notch highly quality video that captured action as well as the slow motions, stills and visual effects to include the on screen instructions.

I am completely satisfied with this video and would recommend to anybody. In fact I am using the video to train students in my Executive Protection (Bodyguard) School. HardTargetbodyguards.com

The only downfall to the video is that you don't have a real instructor to coach you when you are messing up or doing something strategically wrong.  Well, I guess you can't have everything but I'm sure if these instructors could come through the screen to help they certainly would! :-) ^5 to the Ultimate Krav Series.",1298505600,5,1309,4.653679653679654
4231293,5,B003YOXIPI,"Seriously, this is an awesome set!  Just finished up and def inspired me to continue training with these techniques.  Really impressed with how real everything is.  It's a no nonsense approach to self defense that is set up to teach anybody.  I've taken a few martial arts classes, but nothing like this street smart way to defend yourself and people you care about.  Using objects around you and being aware of your situation is the foundation, and from there it is easy to build on.  Basically, defend yourself at all costs- this DVD set trains you in technique but also in mentality.  Isn't that what martial arts is all about?  Another huge plus: the host does a great job making you feel comfortable with the material and inspiring you to put in the effort to get the maximum out of the DVDs.  Very cool.  Def recommend this to anyone considering self defense.  Video also feels more like a movie- shot really cool and doesn't have that typical self defense/workout video vibe.  Kinda wanna walk down the street at nite in a bad neighborhood now! lol just kidding.  My roommate is going through it right now- can't wait to spar!",1297814400,3,1133,4.633165829145729
4231294,5,B003YOXIPI,"I am a fitness, movement teacher of a couple decades.  DVD watching is one of my professional requirements to determine what folks are interested so I can understand motivation for movement.  I was guided to this DVD for production and information purposes.  I am not an expert in Krav Maga, but I am experienced in critiquing DVD's for approachability, artistic rendering, and content.  The quality and attention to the audience is of utmost importance.  Congratulations to this production company.  Well done.  I will look forward to their future DVDs for attention to detail.  These folks are passionate in the information that they are delivering.",1296950400,8,651,5.1923076923076925
4231295,5,B003YOXIPI,"The Ultimate Krav Maga 5 Box Set is an awesome resource for Krav Maga training!  Because of the quality of the film, clarity, knowledge, skills, and wide variety of training scenarios it is widely used and appreciated by my students and my private sector of students I teach in the Military, Police, US Marshall, and Border Patrol.

What I regard as a Master Martial Artist as well as a Expert in Krav Maga is the level of Expertise that Gloria Phaeton Productions presents in the film.  I am always honored to hear, watch and learn from those who have proven time in the Self Defense Industry and have given back so much.  This blend of Instructors presented are so valuable and to have this resource is empowering to my already supply of books, tapes, and videos in my Martial Art Library.

Hats off to Travis Dooley and Duncan Pattle, Producers of The Ultimate Krav Maga DVD. Together they are providing resourceful works, entertaining Martial Arts study and handy tools for everyone everywhere as this is there aim and the aim of Krav Maga is so that one may walk in peace!

I encourage all Martial artist, Kravist, and regular people to purchase this set.  It will teach you how to protect yourself in specific situations as well as teach you fundamentals of combatives, how to perform the strikes, how to train to get better Plus how to take care of your body to prevent injury.

By watching this and with the help of a training partner you can grow your skills, add to your tool box of knowledge, and have the confidence to face the fear that if you were ever attacked you are prepared to fight for your life!  The Krav Maga training by these Experts presented in this film can help you.",1296864000,2,1694,4.546052631578948
4231296,5,B003YOXIPI,This DVD set is an excellent resource for any person who wishes to train in Krav Maga.  Each disc includes world class instructors who teach techniques in a clear and concise way.  The filming and production standards enhance the viewing and learning experience. I have recommended this product to many people and had absolutely no complaints.,1296691200,3,343,5.107142857142857
4231297,5,B003YOXIPI,"I purchased this set a couple months ago and love it. I am LE and have attended seminars and training from many Krav Maga instructors and the information in this DVD is great for those interested in learning and advancing in KM. Having trained in several martial arts forms over the past 20+ years, I think KM is the best self defense system for law enforcement and military applications, but also the most realistic for every day defensive situations. My wife loves the DVD's because it focuses on real world scenarios that she has encountered and the defenses against those threats. These DVD's are especially great for women who want an extra level of protection and will help them gain self confidence that they would not necessarily get in other martial arts systems.

The DVD's are professionally done and follow the type of training that I have received from KM instructors over the years; the situation leading to attack, example of the attack, defense against the attack, and several angles of those defenses including repetition and slow motion of the defensive techniques. There is also a lot of instruction on the proper punching and kicking techniques which is a necessity for the novice and a great refresher for the intermediate level student. I also enjoyed seeing multiple KM instructors illustrate their defensive techniques for different attacks. And it's a bonus that some of the instructors are from Israel and have taught and applied KM for years where it is used on a daily basis. So you get the kind of real world expertise that you don't otherwise get from instructors in the U.S.

I hope there are follow-up DVD's on advanced techniques and techniques geared toward law enforcement and military situations that would augment the training I have received in the past.

All in all a very good set of instruction that will no doubt whet peoples appetites to get them interested in receiving formal training from qualified KM instructors.",1291161600,6,1960,4.933333333333334
4231298,4,B003YOXIPI,"From a business standpoint, the product arrived on time perhaps a little earlier then describe. The product was in the condition described. However, one constructive criticism is that the characters and the program did not strike me as true blue Krav Maga Knights.
They struck me as merely actors who were want to be tough guys just to make a good production that will make a lot of money.",1409702400,,389,4.6521739130434785
4231299,4,B003YOXIPI,Good starting place. The techniques and mind set are solid. I would recommend this for beginners. I wish that it had more drill type exercises to incorporate into exercise/practice,1392854400,,180,5.241379310344827
4231300,5,B003YOXIPI,"Many want to learn self defense but ma not have a Krav Maga class near them.  These Videos will take you far, but you must be willing to watch them and practice the materiel to get the best out of them.  It is always best to learn in a class setting but if you do not have the money or thee is not a class around you then these videos are great.

GA1122nd Volunteers, Frontiersmen have developed a Defensive Tactical Training program and many of the techniques in thse videos are used by our personnel as well as material from the Self Defense Company.

I highly Recommend these videos for anyone interested in self defense or Krav Maga.",1392681600,2,637,4.372881355932203
4231301,5,B003YOXIPI,I bought this for my son who is a U.S. Army soldier and will benefit from the self defense genre.  I bought the same thing for myself a year ago and love practicing Krav Maga.,1388966400,,175,4.0
4231302,4,B003YOXIPI,"I received this video set as a gift and I really enjoyed it.  I trained in Krav Maga for about 9 years.  I also completed various instructor-level training courses and also had the privilege of training with one of the instructors on this video set, John Whitman.
I really like how this set was laid out and the information on it is top-notch.  The drills that are included really help the value of this video because at $99.00, it isn't a cheap date.
The reason that I did not give this a 5 star rating is that one of the videos, the one featuring John Whitman, will not play in my regular DVD player.  I have to use my computer to play it.  That is my only gripe.",1386460800,,665,4.1640625
4231303,4,B003YOXIPI,"I am a beginner to Krav Maga and take classes in my local area. I liked the Ultimate Krav Maga Self-Defense Set. It has well presented material which helps me recall my actual class instruction. I find most instructors excellent bringing insight and background I did not receive in class.
I find the information presented by John Whitman very interesting and think he is an excellent teacher. His presentation of Krav Maga in Krav Maga Alliance video demos helped me when I got started.
The one complaint I have is with the original packaging (not Amazon's) the flip pieces that hold each DVD were broken and disc 4 scratched slightly but thankfully it worked.",1384300800,2,660,4.798245614035087
4231304,4,B003YOXIPI,"i would have given this a full 5 star if not for the last DVD i.e. DVD number 5 which has the 2 guys giving information on warm ups.
there idea is great and the warm up exercises are also good but the execution of the DVD 5 leaves a lot to be desired.
Simple points that show maybe not enough mind application:
1. the narrator was just reading of a script and not explaining in laymen terms. That part is terirble.
2. the guy doing the warm ups to show them - why is he in formal attire with a full sleeves shirt, black plants and black leather shoes?
3. the lighting in the last DVD is so dark that you have a hard time to make things out. The fact that the person shojwing the exercises is wearing black formal pants and on a black matter just shows that these 2 people of the last DVD completely missed the point.

The rest 4 DVDs - which are the meats of the instruction are great and I really loved them
the last DVD is just 17 odd minutes and even if bad in execution the idea and exercise are God so excusable.
but they (last DVD) did cost these guys a 5 star rating in my book.",1384041600,4,1085,3.977064220183486
4231305,5,B003YOXIPI,Great way to prepare yourself for situations outside what is taught specifically in the classroom.  I am so glad I have this book in my library to reference!,1382745600,,157,4.607142857142857
4231306,5,B003YOXIPI,Overall I enjoyed the filming and quality of explanation. It was clear cut in its authority and knowledge. Those involved in demonstrating the information gave an experienced background in this no-nonsense approach. If you are taking Krav then it will supplement your classes. If your not then it will help you in understanding what needs to be done in an actual violent situation. Always remember that fighting is your last way in dealing with trouble. But if you must fight then do so with determination and with a way to escape.,1378771200,2,531,4.846153846153846
4231307,5,B003YOXIPI,"great videos. well shot and thought out. step by step, easy to follow, a little slow to move on  between sections, but not a big deal.",1377216000,,134,4.153846153846154
4231308,2,B003YOXIPI,"Entertaining and educational at the very least in my opinion. If you are a Big Billy Bad Ass, you might learn some tips. If you are an average guy, buy a handgun and learn shooting skills.",1376006400,4,188,4.25
4231309,5,B003YOXIPI,"The material content in these recordings is outstanding. It is a great teaching method, broken down in steps of difficulty, well illustrated and the instructions are very good to follow if you don't have any self defense background. If you do have prior training in any system, this is a very good add on to your experience. Any one with experience can see and analyse the moves and implement it to their workouts. I heard from an instructor once say that simplicity is genius, well, this system helps you learn simple techniques for multiple situations so that if you need to react one day, God forbid, you don't stumble and react out of muscle memory.",1357689600,2,653,4.6869565217391305
4231310,4,B003YOXIPI,I got this as a gift for someone who wanted to train in Krav Maga but was unable to go to a studio regularly to train.  It doesn't beat training under a real instructor but its informative and supplements any existing training he has.,1357516800,,234,4.318181818181818
4231311,5,B003YOXIPI,Not a thing to dislike about this video! Sensible defense moves to protect yourself in any situation! I have no prior self-defense training and I believe this video trains the average person.,1355702400,,191,5.0
4231312,5,B003YOXIPI,"This is by far one of the best DVDs I have used. It is much different than other DVDs I have seen in the past. This one brings much higher production value, much clearer presentation of skills, and adds great entertainment value as well.

The DVD series is taught by some of the best Krav instructors in the world to include Duncan Pattle, John Whitmen, Amnon Darsa, and Eyal Yanilov.

It is based on the Israeli self-defense system called Krav Maga. I was blown away by the high production value and appreciated the variety of angles and use of slow motion. The information was communicated clearly and in an entertaining way. I especially enjoyed the graphics with the key points of each element being discussed and the practicality of the strategies and key techniques for street survival. As a bonus, it has easy-to-use menus to help you locate the specifics on what you want to review.
  It is ideal for anyone interested in self-protection in general and Krav Maga specifically. It is great for beginners and advanced as it serves as a valuable resource to learn from and review.
  I train with others and always come back to the DVDs to brush up on my skills and to refresh my memory on important tips that I may be missing.
I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who is serious about improving their ability to confidently handle altercations, and greatly enhance their overall street survival skills.
  All of the instructors on this series are exceptional and this DVD makes you want to train!
  Very well done and worth much much more than the purchase price. Enjoy!",1344470400,2,1577,4.701818181818182
4231313,5,B003YOXIPI,"Top shelf all the way, for this DVD. Great production values, super instructors, easy to learn techniques, everyone can pick up something useful with this set.  I had the whole family watch and learn these defense tactics,and drills. Easy to understand, succinct repetitions, brilliant instruction. This is for everyone who wants to learn how to be safe, and wants to prepare a family. I am glad the bad guys don't know this martial art! You can learn enough in every lesson to be safe right away. I really love the instructors and actors, just something about the way Aussies talk that makes it more interesting! Throw in the Israeli instructors, and you have Oscar material, IMO!!",1334275200,2,682,4.879310344827586
4231314,5,B003YOXIPI,"If you are looking for self-defense and how to deal w/situations on the street, this system is the best one around. I don't know who on the planet knows how to deal w/terrorists and attackers more than the Israelis. This video series has some fantastic instructors, including Eyal (who was the founder's first black belt and who is head of Krav Maga throughout the world). It has a wide range of topics and techniques, all of which are used in not just the IDF, but various other forces throughout the world on a daily basis. I recommend this set to anyone who is interested in learning the system.",1330646400,,598,4.546296296296297
4231315,5,B003YOXIPI,"The DVDs were the most informative set of martial arts instructional videos I have ever seen.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in Krav Maga, regardless of their level of expertise.",1330560000,,388,4.63768115942029
4231316,5,B003YOXIPI,this is probably the best self defense dvd i've seen yet.the first disc is very basic for those who know how to throw a punch and what not . the rest is stuff i never knew. its worth the money buy it........,1316390400,,207,3.9523809523809526
4231317,5,B003YOXIPI,"Such a well put together instructional DVD set. It was great to see instructors from different Krav Maga organization all teaching on the same DVD. The production quality for this DVD set is by far the best I have ever seen. It was very entertaining, informative and fun to watch. Buy this DVD...you won't be disappointed.",1314662400,,322,4.767857142857143
4231331,4,B003YOXIPI,"I am rating this product for what it is, not what it isn't.
The DVD is done very well as other reviewers have said. There are multiple angles, slow motion, and the instructors are just great--guys you'd want to teach you Krav Maga.

If you watch and practice these techniques with a partner, you will without question pick up some techniques and skills that will help you in an encounter. Practicing is essential, though, and without it, you will be bored and not learn much.

I believe that Krav Maga is a superior system of self-defense in that it is more street-savvy than other forms of self-defense, including conventional karate, which require forms and other aspects that don't specifically apply to protecting yourself in a fight.

With all this said, I think the DVD set should be about $30 cheaper if the producers want greater adoption, and I think that actually taking Krav Maga classes, especially after seeing these DVDs, would be incredibly beneficial. I takes years of karate to feel confident on the street. I'd bet that a year of Krav Mega twice a week would be far better.",1313107200,2,1091,4.731578947368421
4231332,5,B003YOXIPI,"Very useful and informative series of DVDs that can benefit both the Novice and the Experienced Kravist, which I find complements the training I'm receiving from my Krav Maga Instructor. I'd recommend this box set to anyone who's interested in learning about Krav Maga or refreshing their knowledge of this excellent fitness and self-defense system.",1311638400,,349,5.363636363636363
4231333,5,B003YOXIPI,Extremely well videoed. I've been studying Krav Maga for the last nearly one year and this is a great adjunct to my training.,1311552000,,125,4.478260869565218
4231334,2,B003YOXIPI,"I do not see how this DVD set was rated so high by its viewers.  Maybe it is just to much for beginers?  (it does say for beginers and intermediates after all)

first I should have been more careful with only two real instructors from Israel...thats the first red flag.
If this set did not have them it would be pure garbage.

Disk 4 seems to be the only ""good"" one, with 3 being OK.

Most of the videos are filmed in a darkened area, which sucks.  The main ""host"" Duncan Pattle makes this set hard to watch.  He makes little sound effects with his mouth with every punch or kick...after a few doven it gets old, and there must be hundreds of them!

I feel some of the material is just watered down by poor instructors like Pattle.  Amnon Darsa and Eyal Yanilov are the only ones on the set worth watching.

If you are looking for simple yet hard core combatives, pass on this set.  Go with something from Kelly McCann/Jim Grover.",1310169600,11,930,4.287356321839081
4231335,5,B003YOXIPI,"Everything you need to get started plus some great bonus sections.  Instruction is clear and demonstrations are filmed in a clearly visible manner.  Worth every penny. However, do NOT buy the Advanced series. It was filmed using a low lit, dark background and viewers cannot see what is being done. If the makers redid the filming, it too would be every bit as excellent as the first 5 series.",1310083200,,393,4.681159420289855

4231337,5,B003YOXIPI,"I've been training Krav Maga for years now. Since in the beginning we had no trainings-facilities around here, we had to learn from DVDs and seminars only. For that reason I have a real great collection of almost all Krav Maga DVDs available.
The ""Ultimate Krav Maga"" DVDs are much different to the DVDs I saw before:
1. The technics are shown very exactly by some of the best and most experienced trainers you can get.
2. Each technic is shown in its stages, in slow motion and from different views.
3. Besides of the basic combatives and the specific defences, you learn a lot about physical and psycological training by exercices and drills. We could absorbe lots of these drills in our regular training. And we make great progress! They show the big importance of preparation of the body and the mind for the worst case of an aggression in the streets etc. Simply learning combatives is surely not enough.

So, for whose who want to learn Krav Maga as a realistic self defence, to protect your health, your life or the lifes of your familiy, in my opinion, these DVDs are the best choice!",1301097600,18,1092,4.571428571428571
