8150826,3,B000JJ5F2K,"State's Evidence is a twisted, independent film, with a weird story, and an unbelievable ending. This film moves from one extreme to the other and really threw me for a curve, but the ending is so spectacular that it truly makes the whole movie worth while. Scott Byers (Douglas Smith) plays a young man who has decided to kill himself and if that wasn't bad enough he wants to do it on video for the world to see. Byers tells his friends of his plan and claims that once you know your fate, you are truly free to be yourself and do whatever your heart really desires. Not only does his group of introverted friends buy it hook, line, and sinker, but they ultimately decide to join him. The story eventually takes an ominous turn, when one of his friends darkest desires emerge, putting the whole group at serious risk. This film had a very low budget, so low in fact, that half of the film is shot by the actors themselves, on camcorder. It was a little stranger, but made for some interesting scenes. The cast is made up mostly of young actors who have little to no big screen experience, but you would never know it, because they were terrific. Movies like this can sometimes be a bit unpredictable and the solid performances given by the cast will really have you buying into ever emotion and situation their characters are feeling. Unfortunately, it's not all good news for State's Evidence, because while the beginning was intriguing and the ending was fantastic, the middle of the movie is very slow and seems to drag on, making it a challenge to even make it to the terrific ending. Most of this film chronicles a day in the life of a group of High School rejects and it most definitely has it moments. State's Evidence features a great young cast and an ending that will blow your mind, but parts of it drag on and the film felt a lot longer than it actually was and that's never a good sign.",1372982400,3,1901,4.434285714285714

8150828,5,B000JJ5F2K,"i have well over 3500 dvds and i can tell you this is one of my favorite movies. it has a story line that will keep you watching, the characters will keep you interested. and the ending... well youll see.. one of the most powerfull teen shock movies i have seen",1214092800,3,261,4.137254901960785
8150829,4,B000JJ5F2K,"While State's Evidence doesn't do as great a job as other films (Bang bang you're dead, elephant)of it's type to illustrate the fragile world of teens and their bullies and deadly results, State's Evidence does present a realistic picture of something that many other reviewers fail to mention: insensitivity and indifference to the reality of death. In a world where death is glorified in media at every turn, the idea that the teen characters in this movie have become insensitive to the idea of death and feel that the idea of their death as a group would be ""cool"" is startling, but very real. There is a lack of care about the finality of death that resonates throughout the film that is far more compelling than the side story of one of the group's other agenda (shooting his bullies with extreme prejudice). There is definitely a lot to talk about with this film. It should be viewed by families with teens right alongside all of the other films in this category. These filmmakers are trying to open our eyes and we owe it to our kids and teens to wake up and really listen. 3.75 stars",1206230400,4,1092,4.576530612244898
8150830,5,B000JJ5F2K,This movie is so terrific. It has a well planned plot and it will surprise you in the end. What scared me is that a lot of what they said I could actually make sense out of and understand. I love it. I could watch it over and over.,1197244800,2,231,3.7346938775510203
8150831,1,B000JJ5F2K,"Chronicling the 'final' two days in the lives of a group of teenagers who make a suicide pact, ""State's Evidence"" simply doesn't work. Considering it is a direct to dvd release, i was more then willing to make allowances for budget etc. but where the film truly fails, is in the actual script. The filmmakers want you to feel sympathy for these people...something which is next to impossible, considering their selfish and arrogant behavior throughout the movie. in the final act, we are supposed to simply forget that the ringleader of this group actually brought about the terrible events that happen ( in what i can only assume was supposed to be a big twist of an ending, but couldn't be more predictable), and actually feel sorry for this young man. Acting wise, it wasn't bad for the most part, though there were definitely moments of overacting. The last 10mins of the film seem thrown together as an afterthought, like the writers ran out of time to tell the story, so they shoved in as much as they could in the final few minutes. The main example of this, is the fact that one second you see one of the main characters counting out pills, struggling on whether or not to kill herself, and the next she is completely forgotten and never mentioned again. The filmmakers didn't even make a cohesive ending.

A similar themed film, ""Elephant"", while i also did not enjoy that, succeeded in making you feel outraged, but also a sense of compassion for the main character. The characters portrayed here lack any redeeming values....being so incredibly self-absorbed as not to notice how much destruction they are leaving behind them until...of course...it is too late.",1172620800,4,1672,4.805555555555555
8150832,5,B000JJ5F2K,"This has got to be one of the best films i have been priveleged to see in a long time. The realism is just insane coming from such young actors. they just didn't play the part, they were it. There's moments in this masterpiece that you flat out forget you're watching a screen. a must see for anyone who likes good cinema.",1170892800,4,322,4.209677419354839
