8565361,2,B00BBFP5W6,"This is the last day of the ""endless summer"" before the guys go off to college and the gals don't. Keith (Gordon Timothy) has an occasional cross town girl friend (Christine Ahanotu)  but really wants Alicia (Candace Allen) who is out of his league. His friends make him a bet that he can't get a kiss.

This is another light drama with stereo-type dialogue.  The acting wasn't great. The sound was choppy. There isn't much action. If you like to hear young adults talk about ghetto names, gays, and sex this one has a lot of that as filler.

No swearing, sex, or nudity. Available on a Walmart 10 pack. $5.00 US",1427328000,2,612,4.4375
