8606755,5,B00ELU7AQM,"After a decade's absence, Claudio Abbado returned to Salzburg in 2012 to conduct these two fine masses.  Mozart's ""Waisenhaus"" (""Orphanage"") Mass (K. 139) is his first full-scale mass, composed at age 12 (some say, with the aid of his father).  It's rarely heard -- but definitely worth listening to.  Schubert's Mass in E-flat major (D. 950), in contrast, is the composer's last (premiered after his death) and has been recorded some two dozen times.  The concluding ""Dona nobis pacem"" is breathtaking.

Leading the outstanding Orchestra Mozart of Bologna, the Arnold Schonberg Choir, and what one reviewer calls ""perfectly cast soloists,"" Abbado plumbs the spiritual depths of these works.  I can't imagine better performances coming along soon.  Both the sound and videography are up to Accentus's usual high standards (although the concert hall itself has no visual interest).

If you like other masses by Mozart or Haydn, you'll like these.",1397692800,5,945,5.295302013422819
