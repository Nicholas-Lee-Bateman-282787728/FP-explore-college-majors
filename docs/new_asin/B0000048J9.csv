We cannot see or hear about a coyote without saying ""Im a caaaaaaayote & caaaayotes don't wear no clothes""!!  Its like a familiar funny movie, where you know all the punch lines!  I plan on buying the app for my grandkids---I still have the book set--and wish it was on DVD.  I swear, its THE funniest re-telling of a tall tale ever.  Robin Williams is at his finest!!",1328572800,,540,4.525773195876289
