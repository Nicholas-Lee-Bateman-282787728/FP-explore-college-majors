8148462,5,B000J10KSM,This is a great product by an amazing singer-songwriter. Great voice and sadly does not get the recognition he deserves. This shows off what I believe to be his best work to great effect.,1297296000,,187,4.529411764705882
8148463,5,B000J10KSM,"Certainly the best part of this DVD is the documentary. If you're a Darren Hayes fan, it gives you wonderful insight to this time of his life. There are interviews with him from years later, where he looks back on the footage and comments. Darren is always entertaining, but this is my favorite tour DVD, after A Big Night In, because it feels a little more real.",1237593600,,363,4.432835820895522
8148464,1,B000J10KSM,I ordered this DVD unaware that it was coded for a different region than the U.S.  It wouldn't work on a standard US DVD player.,1202342400,2,128,4.12
8148465,4,B000J10KSM,"I was fortunate to recieve the DVD and was amazed that Darren was so open and intimate about all that was going on in his life, him dealing with a solo career that he was unprepared for, his hopes and fears,and having the wherewithall to handle it without going over the edge. I totally respect him for sticking it out the way he did, and I am glad it has all come together the way it has.

The concert itself was good, singing songs from Spin, and a few Savage Garden songs, and especially Insatiable live it sounds so good! You will throughly enjoy the DVD If you are a fan or you just want to know what Darren was going through in the winter of 2002.",1178409600,2,653,4.141732283464567
8148466,5,B000J10KSM,"I had a fairly good idea of the man behind the music before I watched this, but the DVD brings you into his life..into his mind. You get to see Darren ""warts and all"". He doesn't hide behind ""celebrity""- You see him as a  vulnerable human being who has hopes and fears - not just some ""POP STAR"".

I have always been amazed at how open he's been with his fans through his music. All you have to do is listen to his lyrics and you know what is in his heart.  There are no pretenses. Listening and watching him narrate each crucial part gives you a very intimate sense of who Darren Hayes was and who he's become.

This DVD was filmed during a pivotal time of his life. It was his first solo tour after leaving (he wasn't the one who wanted to leave) the very successful band- Savage Garden.  He'd basically been promised to be #1 by his record label and then all of a sudden finding himself standing alone without their support- As he puts it, he had fallen from grace.

This is a man who takes us on a brave journey into his past. You sit and watch him up pulling himself up and becoming a better person because of his perceived failures. He is an amazing man.. and this is a wonderful DVD filled with lessons we can all learn from.",1161129600,9,1232,4.177215189873418
