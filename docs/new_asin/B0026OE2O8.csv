3854601,5,B0026OE2O8,"Home is an excellent documentary which aims to familiarize us with our planet while reminding us of our place and responsibilities vis--vis our environment.
The amount of effort and research put into this project is evident and as a result the documentary helps transport the viewer to different locations allowing one to lay eyes on natural wonders and disasters alike. Glenn Close does an amazing job narrating in a way that brings to mind the Lords of the Rings, while the photography is simply breathtaking!
In short, Home is a must-see documentary, strongly recommended to those people that do care about the legacy they leave behind for the generations to come. 5 Stars",1244332800,31,675,4.982300884955753
3854602,5,B0026OE2O8,"One may not agree with the theory of evolution, but that should not be the reason for not watching/buying this DVD.  This film is about man's greed and the results.  We must become stewards of our planet or face the fact that our children or grandchildren may likely suffer unthinkable changes to our (American)wealthy way of life.  This film shows what has already happened in my lifetime of 60 years, and has certainly awakened my family to our responsibility to care for our home.  The photography is absolutely exquisite, the music haunting, and the narrative poetic.",1244246400,23,571,4.916666666666667
3854603,5,B0026OE2O8,"This documentary will move you and scare you.  The visuals rival that of ""Planet Earth"" released a few years ago.  The colors are simply stunning.  The truth told in this film is mind boggling.  For those that still don't believe - watch the movie.  If after that point you can still sit there and say we have NO impact on our home, then - there is nothing that can be done for your ignorance.

Get the movie.  It will be money well spent!",1244246400,5,439,4.216867469879518
3854604,1,B0026OE2O8,"The beginning of the theatrical trailer immediately tells you this is a production based on evolution.  ""Life, a miracle that began around 4 billion years ago"" is how this production starts.  No thank you.  The filming may be breath taking but it is not worth the scripting.  Planet Earth is better quality and they do a wonderful job at keeping to the facts, not fiction.",1244246400,10,372,4.676923076923077
3854605,5,B0026OE2O8,"This is a magnificent production. I'm now watching it on the National Geographic channel and had to check to see if a DVD was available. No commercials to interrupt the thread!

The photography is stunning, the music enjoyably fitting and the narrator's voice smooth and clear. The story is informative, sad and scary.

Yes, this production conveys the message that the current economic model of consumption is not conducive to long-term survival (in the manner to which we have become accustomed) where a secure supply of uncontaminated food/water and adequate shelter/clothing are a given.

Sometimes ""a picture is worth a thousand words"".",1244160000,49,641,5.264705882352941
3854606,5,B0026OE2O8,"This is a great documentary film! The images and shots were movingly stunning, the colors were amazingly rich and fluid.
THe narrative highlighted the problems that we've created with literature-worthy eloquence and with objectivity whilst not forgetting humanity's needs. The mostadmirable part of it was that while it instills a sense of pain and regret for the environment, it focuses on what we still have and what we can still save. But behind every good narrative, there is a good soundtrack and the one for this documentary lives up to its narrative, with music from all corners of the globe, each fitting into its place and each a place where it fits.

One extremely noteworthy aspect of narrative,picture and soundtrack mixing well is that the soundtrack doesn't drown out the narrative, as some documentaries are won't to do. Also, the documentary allows for moments of wordless eloquence to captivate the viewer in sound and image - yet without dragging it to being ""verbose"".

all in all, the five stars awarded are truly deserved.
one for picture, one for mastery of language in narration, one for soundtrack, one for humanity the last one, for message and overall delivery.",1244160000,21,1187,5.020304568527918

3854625,4,B0026OE2O8,I thought going in this was going to be cute. I am not sure if I am sad that I was wrong. It's not a good movie in any sense. However it is a fun movie. Imagine where ET gets takes over the planet.  Seriously the kidnapping scene is something scary while it looks cute and is played for laughs the idea is horrifying. More so with the fate of those whoever live on the planets that the aliens take over. It is cringy and creepy. Yet surprisingly it's fun to watch with someone who wants to rip or point out flaws/plot holes. The characters have enough charm that you are not annoyed to the point of just clicking off and could stand if your kid watches it on repeat. Truthfully the part where it shines is in it's awful charm. It is really a movie you just sit and mock.,1523664000,,770,4.099337748344371

3854629,4,B0026OE2O8,"This movie is very sweet, and I really like the concept. The script is smart and hands out wisdom and humor in judicious doses. The characters are sympathetic, and some of the messages are relevant to real-life global issues, both in history and in present day. The first time we watched this, we weren't sure about some of the music, but upon a second viewing, we grew fonder of the soundtrack. The reason I'm giving this four stars rather than five is that there is some language and some violence that is unnecessary. I don't think it's inappropriate, exactly, but I think the movie would be much improved if the words/actions were eliminated. The sentiments of anger and frustration could easily be conveyed in a different, perhaps more effective, manner. Our kids (7, 5, and 2) all liked this movie, but I would have felt more comfortable showing it to my younger two if there were less vitriol and pushing/shoving. Check out the book that this movie is based on: The True Meaning of Smekday, if you're interested in the origins of this story.",1523145600,2,1048,4.701086956521739

Minimalism is also another way to take care of this issue but definitely looking for the sun's energy then drilling our beautiful Earth. Please watch it even if you are not sure what this documentary is about. IT WILL BE WORTH YOUR TIME learning about it and how each of us can change this world for our future generations.

3854778,5,B0026OE2O8,"I am almost 30 and I love this movie. It's a heartfelt story about an alien arriving on Earth with it's species. All humans have been put into a relocation center - that the aliens think is ""better"" and ""nice"" because it's filled with games and candy. One little girl accidentally was left in the city, and becomes a traveling companion for the alien. He made a mistake and is trying to run away, and she is trying to find her mom with her faithful cat named Pig. It's hilarious and cute. I haven't laughed this hard in a kids movie - for kid humor - in years. Despite my normal dislike of pop music, I love the soundtrack. It's very fitting.

Potential Cons
I am not a parents, but I do teach English as a Second Language, so I feel it should be noted that the alien speaks very poor English. He mixes up words since it is his Second Language and he messes up words. For example, he calls exiting a cupboard into the main room going ""into the out."" He drops prepositions and articles sometimes as well. He constantly messes up ""my mom."" While this adds to the cuteness and the humor, if you have a toddler learning to speak, it might be confusing. I'm not sure, as I said, I have no children. Personally, I now tell my kitties that they need to go ""into the out now"" when I want them to go on the balcony. : )",1498953600,3,1310,4.177865612648222

3854805,1,B0026OE2O8,"See everyone's saying that Rhianna was the main problem of this movie and don't get me wrong, she is part of the problem but I didn't think her performance was that bad. I hated that almost every song that was played was literally her but... why not get a little bit of promotions I guess on a kids movie. What I hated about the movie was everything else, like the story. Spoiler Alert (stop reading if you actually wanna get the movie) The boovs literally stole the entire generation of that star fish alien's race. Yeah sure I know that's the story but it's pretty weak when literally the whole thing happened by mistake because the leader was so cowardly and wanted praise for running away. Yeah sure some problems you just have to run from but that's not a good message to send to kids throughout the whole movie. The main protagonist being ""oh"" was not memorable whatsoever, the whole Alien race of Boov was not memorable, and thought the whole story was just plain stupid. Then they were going to kill oh because he sent a email to everyone in the galaxy to get to earth because they have to run away again but they left Captain Smek who was the literal cause of kidnapping an entire generation of an alien race, being to cowardly to face that said alien race's sole survivor, and causing everything bad to befall on the boov and earth, to be a DJ on the moon. Not so much of a punishment there. Maybe I'm thinking too much on it but I did not like the movie one bit. No memorable characters, stupid plot, dumb movie altogether.",1493769600,,1534,4.404929577464789

There have been several eradications of life on this planet, and whether we finish sawing the limb we are sitting on and suffocate, dehydrate or starve, or an asteroid splashes into Kansas and eliminates us and everything else in a flash, our end will come.  We somehow think we are special, but really our lives are no more valuable to this planet than the dinosaurs or the passenger pigeons.  To paraphrase Darwin, the ultimate fate of all species is extinction.  We will be no different, and truthfully, the Earth will be better off without us.  No species has done the damage here we have.  We should be ashamed, but we seem to be proud of it, and we have all been told what happens to the proud.  My only real fear is that we are able to leave Earth before we are eliminated, and spread the virus of our kind to other worlds only to rape those as well.",1491609600,,992,4.324324324324325

We can detonate every nuclear weapon on this planet, wipe mankind from the face of the earth, render the surface of earth uninhabitable for thousands of years, but in only a few hundred thousand, probably less, earth will still be there, no worse for wear.

Before you buy into the scare tactics of this movie, enter into Google the exact opposite of this movie's supposed ""facts,"" to see what thousands of other scientists think about these issues. Alarmists would have you think nearly all men of reason believe in MANMADE warming (not the sun, etc)...that such things as cow farts and SUVs destroy the planet, without telling you how much $$$ is being made having ""useful idiots"" convinced. What they don't tell you should scare you. The individuals and groups running away with the $$$ should scare you. Poor little children think polar bears are in great danger. Google that one, for starters. Students who buy into the lies think that just because some information comes from NASA, it must be true, forgetting how politicized all bureaucracies are. Think about it:  has there ever in the history of the world, been so much money gathered on one place (D.C.)? Money to be spread around. Money to be stolen.

The breathtaking beauty, awesomeness and amazing footage and photography is 100 stars. I like Glenn Close but don't agree with all the lies, deceit, lies and deceit, and lies in this documentary. Everyone has free will to decide and believe, and there is tons of information to be learned. I suggest ""Beginnings"" and the many documentaries available on Amazon Prime are astonishing, where truth is actually proven. ""Beginnings"" is a documentary, about free will, creation, evolution, and science, and common sense. This guy nails it! The Grand Canyon, how it happened and the facts are explained brilliantly in Beginnings, with free will to think, feel, decide and believe as you want to. Watch not one, not two, nor three or four documentaries but any and all that you can watch to gain knowledge and think for yourselves. I'm just saying, this ""Home"" documentary is misleading and deceiving, with misinformation so don't waste your free will believing as you will from one source. I'm still not done myself, but I know what I believe and it hasn't change since I was a little girl, unique and special, one of a kind, after studying, learning, reading, cross referencing information, on and on, over and over, watching tons of documentaries and reading the Bible.

At 12 months old she just danced and danced to any part of the movie that played music and was mesmerized by the bright colors. It's always been the perfect alarm clock when it's time to wake from her nap, just start the movie at beginning of any part with music, and those eyes would pop right open and she'd start shakin that booty. Now at 18 months she crawls up in MiMis lap and says ""me HOME"", so as soon as I start that movie she is mesmerized from beginning to end, except now she giggles and laughs at appropriate times and jumps off my lap with her Frozen microphone to sing and dance. This has been an amazing movie for this grandma to watch her grand daughter grow into. I love every new visit with her because we will watch Home at least 3-4 times during a sleepover at MiMi's.

My daughter absolutely loved it so much that she watched it 3x within a 24 hour period.  I love that it is no subliminal messaging/ innuendo in the movie like a lot of the children movies have nowadays.

3855059,1,B0026OE2O8,"Brought here by the cult fanaticism behind this movie, I was disappointed by frenetic animation, clumsy scene direction, and poorly chosen voice casts and acting (IE Rhianna). Time does not flow cohesively throughout the story and main conflicts and antagonists are rushed or not prefaced. The movie plays out as one big montage, with superfluous use of establishing shots and impractical character actions. Animation errors are abundant in this film; with disappearing background objects, clipping issues, and miscellaneous masses and physics applied to characters and objects. Don't expect anything interesting in terms of scifi -- this is built very much like a children'ts book, and I lost interest when the ""tuned up super car"" was powered by slushies, bubbles, and ticker tape.

The saving grace to this film was Parsons' casting as ""Oh"". His talents shine through and give substance to an otherwise dry, bland, and flakey cast of characters. Parson's effectively communicates the character he plays, which leaves a stark contrast with Rhianna as Tip. For a movie supposedly promoting cultural diversity, little of ethnicity is discussed or implied -- save for the big name celebrities they tacked onto the film. Oftentimes Tip's voice acting underwhelming and did not sync up to her lips or actions, further there is little in the way to empathize her character or establish backstory.

Overall this is a movie suited for audiences under 5 years, I would not recommend this to adults or older children as it has a tendency to speak down to its audience.",1476144000,4,1560,5.16205533596838

3855153,5,B0026OE2O8,"I love this movie for so many reasons! Touches on so many topics/lessons for kids and is adorable as well! Initially I thought it might be annoying or for really young kids based on the cover picture, but this isn't the case at all!

Love the lessons on diversity, accepting other cultures vs believing you are superior/smarter, etc, understanding emotions, consequences of mistreating others & being reckless, appreciation of art, power of music and dancing, being unique & different, taking perspective of others, friendship & family, loyalty & sacrifice vs selfishness, bravery, and more.

I also love that the main character is a beautiful black girl with curly hair and possibly hispanic mother? instead of white like so many movies are. I like that media is finally (though slowly) catching up to real culture. This is especially great for the girls I nanny for, who are half white/black and asked why so many Disney movies have girls with light skin and straight/wavy hair instead of darker skin and curly hair like theirs. They already talk about wanting straight hair and how their dolls with lighter skin are prettier, which is heartbreaking. The girl is also in 7th grade, and movie appeals to both younger and older kids, while also being entertaining for adults! :)",1472515200,6,1278,4.9672897196261685

Jim Parsons as ""OH"" is just perfect.  I love him anyhow.

If you are looking for a movie for your kids that you won't feel tortured having to watch it with them over and over, this is a good one.  Great writing, excellent jokes and as always a good moral to the story.

Basically a reboot of 'Lilo and Stitch' with a tired plot about a girl befriending an alien to find her lost mom (and why is it that we can buy into a story about aliens driving flying cars utilizing slushee parts, yet its completely impossible to find a decent, loving DAD in Hollywood stories anymore?) The ""humor"" is dry and tedious (and it seemed like the leader of these aliens is little more than a rip-off of King Julien from Madagascar, particularly the accent.) The symbolism seems like something out of a bad film interpretation class: aliens who flee in soft bubble spaceship and an evil alien in a massive, pointy sharp triangular ship.... give me a break.

But they're peaceful enough, and they are looking for a new world where them might be safe from angry planet destroying pyramids.  Soearth, right?  Yeah, they come to earth and one of their outcast members, Oh (voiced by The Big Bang Theorys Jim Parsons), meets the orphaned Tip (voiced by Rihanna, who doesnt sound anything like a little girl) and together they strike up an unlikely friendship.  Youd think an alien with superior technology could teach an earth kid a thing or two but, nope!  Our kids are so dumb they cant even learn from superior beings!  Tip, actually, is both sad and precocious; shes sadocious.  She lost her mom but knows how to scrape by and singyou know, because shes voiced by Rihanna.  Well, she teaches Oh a thing or two about living life without fear, about emotional intelligence, and together they find her mom and save the earth and save the Boogs.  The end.

The movies bright, has a thumpin soundtrack, and is touchy-feely sentimental.  It also tries too hard.  Kids should like it.  Not so much here thrown in special for the adults but there's a lot of (pretty average) musically themed special features.  You know, to add life to the party.",1465603200,,1276,4.736363636363636
3855393,5,B0026OE2O8,"I've been watching Pixar movies since Pixar was a small open source company recently purchased by Steven Jobs for a couple of million dollars and long before they had any affiliation with Disney.  In terms of plot, execution, and creativity, this movie stands up to any of the Disney Pixar films.  Beyond this, it's funny, perfectly delightful, contains important lessons on cultural hegemony, and includes a thought provoking and completely surprising twist ending.  So I as quite shocked when I came to purchase it Amazon (I've watched it on Netflix streaming half a dozen times with my kids) and noticed the large number of 1-star reviews.  WTF?  Then it hit me: the main characters are a teenage black girl from Barbados (voiced by Rihanna, also from Barbados) and an alien voiced by an openly gay actor who plays a physicist on a popular TV show.  This is likely quite upsetting to racists and Christian superstitionists offended by the idea of smart black girls and alien life forms that view humans as an inferior species.  So, if you are a racist offended by the idea of teenage black female lead character or a superstitious human exceptionalist, you probably should avoid this film.

3855433,5,B0026OE2O8,I threw this on to try and entertain my daughter one morning. She is very young so she had no interest in it but kid that are older and have the ability to sit and watch a movie will like it. There are funny parts in it that will have them laughing and more serious parts as well. The aliens come to take over the planet as their new home. They don't hurt the humans but rather move them all to one spot on earth. Eventually the reason the aliens are on the planets is solved and you have a happy ending. It seems to have a lesson of acceptance by the aliens finding out their enemy isn't actually an enemy but a misunderstanding. A human kid ends up becoming friends with an alien which is when the alien helps her find her mother - accepting each other and working to accomplish the goal.,1464825600,,790,4.136363636363637

3855719,5,B0026OE2O8,"I sort of fell in love with this movie without expecting to.  It was kind of ridiculous I wound up watching the rental so many times to the point that I just bought it when I saw it at the store lol.. I think it's difficult when you only review things you love (or super dislike) - I should probably review more but when you see others making similar comments for or against something it's easy to just let them say it.

 For me the movie had so many elements and layers that you don't often find in animated films. The writing was great, I find myself quoting Boov from time to time now. The Boov (purple creature on the cover) had control of everything in the galaxy for the most part and thought that they were right about everything but it took a series of events to help them begin to understand that other beings have feelings and a right to live a good life of their own making as well.  Once that became more clear suddenly the truth of the various infringements on the rights of others became more obvious and there was a new willingness to  reach out and be vulnerable and correct those wrongs.  It was also a feel-good story on ways that  when people's lives get turned upside down, they can still find ways to get back to the people/things they care about and make things right.  Kids and parents who have been through a lot or who would like to understand others who have, would probably really appreciate it.",1460851200,6,1422,4.339622641509434

3855931,2,B0026OE2O8,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It looked good, but it just missed the mark in so many ways. For one thing, the alien Oh (voiced by Jim Parsons) has this funny way of talking that was meant to be cute but comes out irritating. I though Rihanna did a good job as the voice of Tip, but did the entire soundtrack have to be Rihanna songs? It got pretty distracting when the plot reached a slower point but the music was still electro-pop-funk-whatever. The animation is good and the plot is okay, if simplistic, but many of the jokes missed the mark. I rented it for free, and it was fine to have in the background while I did laundry--but I wouldn't spend money on the DVD.",1456099200,,680,4.27906976744186

Really little ones may not fully understand the story-line, however the bright colors, Funny Faces, and silly things that always seem to happen will be sure to keep them entertained. For the older kids and the adults it has a really good message behind it. I would encourage anyone looking for a movie for Family night look into this one.",1455926400,,625,4.464912280701754

3855949,3,B0026OE2O8,"Story was ok, characters were interesting to see play out, it wasn't a polished finished product and the voice of the purple guy grated on my nerves pretty heavily (he's supposed to be unloved so I guess it was in character, but it made me want to hit mute or turn it off multiple times... congratulations to the voice actor for being genuinely annoying I guess?)

It's a bit stretched long and the transition between scenes and plot elements is sometimes pretty forced and awkward - it could have benefitted from a bit of quality editing and a writer who could do character interaction and plot development at the same time instead of having one or the other - or usually one, and then the other tacked on or crowbarred into a scene.

And kids won't care but all of the plot devices / macguffins / etc are just so forced in this thing... nothing makes any damn sense.

All that said? Kids enjoyed it, good ending (when it finally came) and some fun ideas (slushie powered car, learning to see that things aren't what they say they are / what they seem) and the kids voice actor wasn't bad.",1455667200,,1090,4.44

Oh the Alien is absolutely wonderful and so funny. It was a pleasure to see Jim Parsons play a cooky, clumsy alien. Also, to see Rihanna as a feisty, sarcastic little girl was fun too. This is a great family film with just enough funny jokes to keep even the adults entertained. Also, look how cute Pig the Cat is!

I thought the Boov's were so raw and child-like. I loved the depiction of emotions in their skin color. They are loveable little goobers. At first I thought Rhianna's voice was a little too adult to portray a child, but you get used to it. Tip is relatable and realistic. The music was great and the animation was beautiful.

3855994,5,B0026OE2O8,"This is a beautiful movie about friendly aliens named the Boov invading Earth. Boov are a race who praise running away from danger and not taking chances and frown on uniqueness, friendship, parties, and especially making too many mistakes. But among the Boov is a strange, humorous fella named Oh, who loves making friends and hosting parties, is very unique, and makes many, hilarious accidental mistakes. It isn't until he runs into a spunky human girl named Tip that he realizes that mistakes are part of life, and that uniqueness is something to be celebrated, and even when things seem darkest, the power of Hope and love can do amazing things, and that he can find home and friendship in unlikely places. This hilarious movie features Jim Parsons (Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory) as Oh, Rhianna as Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucchi, Steve Martin (Orin Scrivello D.D.S. from Little Shop of Horrors, among other things) As the hilarious leader of the Boov: Captain Smeck, and Jennifer Lopez as Lucy Tucchi, Tip's ""Mimom"".

It also had some great humorous moments for the adults, too. I really like Jim Parsons as the alien, Oh. He is very funny with his alien views of our ordinary world.

This children's animation has substance. An alien race, the Boov, invades earth and moves in after 'removing' people. It is a children's movie, so that part is done without any real fight. A girl meets an outcast Boov and, while working together, they learn from each other. The Boov learns about family and friendship. He also learns that making mistakes is okay, a part of life. I liked the movie and can recommend it.",1451952000,,594,4.5092592592592595

She is a girly girl, she loves princesses and such--and is a Frozen fan. So I was surprised when she fell in love with this one. The music is good, and the humor can be appreciated by adults. There aren't too many scary parts either, so that's good for the younger set. I'd give this one a shot, it's good for boys and girls.",1451952000,2,449,4.113636363636363

It's got an awesome soundtrack.  Whether you like this kind of music or not, it will get stuck in your head. We're rock music lovers, yet our little girl dancing around and singing the songs is so much fun.  This movie has valuable lessons about friendship and courage.  Jim Parsons (Sheldon of Big Bang Theory) was the perfect voice actor for the main Boov, ""Oh"".  Rihanna is actually a really good voice actress for the character ""Tip"".",1451692800,,591,4.792079207920792

3856318,5,B0026OE2O8,"I really like this movie.  It's got a really great premise for a few themes in the movie.  The fact that the ""Boov"" believe they are so superior to humans, but ""Oh"" discovers that just because you think you might be better than someone or something else, doesn't mean it's true.  TIp also makes a journey of her own to understand that ""Oh"" and the ""Boov"" can change.  It's a movie that shows the value of getting to understand a culture that you might not be familiar with before you judge the way someone from that culture does something.  It's got a lot of cute insider jokes in it that will appeal to adults (at the end in the party one of the Boov has a ""screw drive"" drink that latterly includes a Screw driver in it) and a lot of up front kid geared jokes that the kids will love (eating the blue deodorizer in the urinal...what kid hasn't thought about trying a little bite of that...come on...admit it...everyone has wondered about those blue tabs!).  The party addition isn't that all that special.  There are a few added features, but mostly I got it for the movie.

3856356,2,B0026OE2O8,"This is definitely one for the kiddies! The jokes are pretty weak at that Oh character becomes pretty annoying after a while. Its about an alien race, the Boov's, who take over earth so they can escape the evil Gorg. The Boov's spend time reorganising earth by getting rid of things that they find useless, whilst Oh is struggling to find friends and is unable to fit in with his fellow Boov's. Tip, voiced by Rihanna, manages to escape from the Boov's with her cat and she is finding it hard to cope with the fact that they had taken her mum. She then bumps into Oh, who is on the run because he sent out an invitation for his party, to the whole of the Boov colony which will blow there cover and eventually reach Gorg. Oh and Tip then end up on a mission to find Tips mum and save Oh's planet. I did find the jokes more silly than funny and it was extremely corny in parts. There's not that much material for adults and it amazed me how intelligent Oh turned out to be towards the end. On the plus side, the animation does look great and the attention to detail is impressive but I found myself cringing through most of the film. Don't get me wrong, it's the perfect movie for keeping the kids quiet because they will definitely love it but from an adults point of view, it just didn't work for me. Average!

Round-Up: I've always found Jim Parsons voice pretty annoying, after watching a few episodes of the Big Bang Theory and you really can tell that they modeled the Oh character around his mannerisms and weird one liners. He was a good choice to play Oh but it just became a bit too much after a while. There wasn't that much to Rihanna's character (Tip) but I did giggle when Captain Smek (Steve Martin) was using earth things, like a hoover and a hair dryer, in the completely wrong way. Anyway, the movie was directed by Tim Johnson who also made Antz, Over The Hedge, Sinbad: Legend of the Seas and Kung Fu Panda Holiday. Because of the time that it takes to makes these animation movies, I'm not surprised that he hasn't made that many but he has made enough profit from this film and Antz, to bank roll other projects in the future. Although this movie wasn't for me, it's great for a family day out and it's harmless fun for all ages.",1449878400,,2250,4.306603773584905

I personally love animations and this movie is by far a new favorite for me and my daughters. The storyline (not going to give details for those who have no viewed it just yet) is different, it is definitely not something we've seen throughout the years. It also teaches a lesson & my 4 year old seemed to catch on to it all by herself. It is definitely a must see. I would also like to add that it is Autism approved (my 2 year old Autistic daughter loves it) !!",1449446400,,488,4.136842105263158

3856420,1,B0026OE2O8,"Sometimes, when you watch an animated movie because one of the characters is voiced by someone you like to watch on tv, you get a gem - for me, this was the case with Pixar's Inside Out, which I found out only through an interview with Lewis Black and which greatly exceeded my expectations.

Not so with this poorly executed animation, which I admittedly watched only because I love Jim Parsons as Dr. Sheldon Cooper in The Big Bang Theory. But his acting skills - so obviously front-and-center in TBBT - couldn't hope to save this god-awful, boring and not even moderately entertaining fiasco. I'm not a fan of dumbed-down language to begin with, so the fact that the BOOV (which would've more aptly been named BOO) are apparently speaking in some gibberish that is part texting language, part Yoda speak, was already irritating from the get go. But then the movie progressed and JUST. KEPT. GETTING. WORSE.

I don't know what's more ridiculous - the lacking dialogue, the Boov enemy called Gorg (I guess Star Trek has a monopoly on Borg so changing just one letter was appropriate - groan!), the female character incongruously named Gratuity (""my friends call me Tip""), the constant streaming of presumably peppy, teeny bopper pop music...It's absolutely barf-tastic.

Not all adults enjoy animated movies, but I'm one of those who do when they're well made. This, sadly, is NOT well-made and clearly seems designed to capitalize on the rising star of Jim Parsons by giving him a lead (voice) role.

Personally, I think the making of animated movies should be left to the people who actually know what they're doing: PIXAR. Everyone else seems to be inept at combining cartoon-style movies with any sort of substantial dialogue and/or story line. I don't know how anyone could actually enjoy watching this and I found that the lacking content completely failed to successfully bring across any ""hidden meaning"" that would've given this overly silly movie some depth.",1449187200,3,1969,4.9395770392749245

In general, it's a great family movie with plenty of kid friendly humor and appropriate dramatic scenes.",1449100800,,314,4.338983050847458

3856436,1,B0026OE2O8,"We tend to borrow movies from our local library -- if we like them, then we consider purchasing them.  So far, we have only ran across ONE movie that was so bad, we were glad we previewed it before buying.  Well?  We've encountered the second.  It failed to even hold the attention of the children [and one of them selected it!]; my wife thought it was lacking, and my teenager basically said it sucked.  I myself was saved from the horror -- I only listened, not watched.  My opinion?  Save your money and buy something more worthwile.",1449100800,2,536,4.463917525773196

3856441,4,B0026OE2O8,"3.5 stars. It's no Toy Story, but it's sweet, touching and charming. Parson's voice is an acquired taste, but Rihanna does a wonderful job voicing the girl. It could have used a bit more story, but then again the last few scenes had everyone in this household smiling while sniffling back tears. It does
sometimes feel like you're watching an extended Rihanna-and-J-Lo music video. Then again, their songs, and the whole soundtrack, are excellent, and you're pretty much guaranteed to have them circling around in your head for the next several days. Not the best animated feature ever made, but pretty darn good and much better than the critics led us to believe.",1449100800,,664,4.884955752212389
