It was often not really ""clean"" as well. Some parts made me a little uncomfortable, like some of the religious jokes at the end and some of the sexual innuendos. It definitely was not so bad that I turned it off, but I wouldn't want my kids to watch it. I do really love how much he admires his wife and puts her on a pedestal and I did laugh harder and more often to his book and other show than most other comedy I have been exposed to.

I had my kids watching because he was supposed to be clean.  He curses throughout the show and has several references to porn and sex.  There are several drug references.  How is this considered clean?  Then he goes on to poke fun at Jesus and God.  As a practicing Christian, I was totally offended.  No more Jim Gaffigan for me.  I will stick with Brian Regan when I want comedy.",1433548800,3,557,4.372549019607843

As a fellow Hot Pockets' lover, the ""Hot Pockets"" routine is the peak of this performance and had me rollin' with laughter. Gaffigan is Catholic and he mentioned Pope John Paul II in this 2005 concert as he also did in a recent 2014 television appearance, being funny without being offensive.",1416787200,7,529,4.698924731182796

He doesn't drop f bombs. He isn't angry. He doesn't insult anyone. What's left? Check out this DVD and find out. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. by the way? I love the naughty comics, too.

2452212,4,B000C20VIW,"Hopefully you've seen Jim Gaffigan do his act on tv so you are already familiar with his stuff. He is extremely funny and talks about stuff that is so dead-on right that you can relate to what he is saying. He talks about everyday stuff like going to the grocery and talks about it in a way that is funny because you can totally relate to it. He seems to come from the Seinfeld-ian school and that's great. He is respectable and clean- nothing too vulgar and no profanity. This was his earliest dvd so it should be watched first since he gets funnier with time. If you are a serious fan of his, watch Beyond The Pale 1st then King Baby 2nd then Mr. Universe 3rd. All are funny but this being his earliest is the weakest so that is why I say watch it first.

When I decided to buy used (because of the significantly lower price), I wasn't quite sure what to expect. When it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised in its condition. It was obvious it had been used as a DVD rental at a store somewhere, however the company did a great job in restoring the disc--there were virtually no scratches. I watched it right away, and laughed my ass off of course.

2452259,2,B000C20VIW,"Slow moving and dull, and the comic looked like he was going through an uninspired routine. Kept waiting for it to get funny (given the reviews), but it never did.",1318377600,,163,4.466666666666667
2452260,3,B000C20VIW,"When it comes to comedy, it goes without saying that I love comedians that appear to embrace what they talk about. While it's more than obvious why a comedian that fails to do so is doomed, there is nothing greater when the entire picture (looks and sincerity) come together. While comedians like George Carlin and Christopher Titus have a knack at deciphering what is wrong with society, Jim Gaffigan is a master at tackling the lighter aspects of human behavior, especially when it comes to people and their food stuffs. Point blank, I can't think of any other comedian that can comment on the foods we love (perhaps a bit too much) like Jim can. This doesn't make him as one dimensional as he's able to weave other subjects into his shows but it has more-or-less become his unofficial calling card and as a person who loves food I can't help but reflect on how true it really is.

Still, as rosy as such a description is Gaffigan's brand of comedy runs into a little bit of trouble in DVD form. Given my first experience with Gaffigan's work was the audio recording of this show I was extremely disappointed to find the energy and spirit in Gaffigan's voice does not carry over into his stage presence. I was expecting him to be a bit more active in playing some of these bits out with a camera in front of him but as it stands his movement is light-years behind others like a seventy year-old George Carlin who, for obvious and well-justified reasons, can't jump around the stage like he use to.

With such an argument placed in front of them, some people may be quick to defend Gaffigan and say his sheepish demeanor on stage is an extension of the lazy, offish person he claims to be. I thought of that as well but he just looks to fidgety and uncomfortable for it to be an act. If it is an act it isn't convincing and gives off an opposite, unintentional message. Do I want him to bop around the stage like Robin Williams? No. As much as I enjoy Williams' comedy one Robin Williams in the world is more than enough. I don't say this to be cruel but to point out that the video portion of this show adds next to nothing to the experience; the proof lies in the fact the audio portion of this show graces my CD player a lot more than the DVD graces my DVD player.

Unlike the vast body of comedians out there, Gaffigan's shortcomings are easy to decipher and pass judgment on. While some may question why that may be good thing, it ultimately makes some decisions that would otherwise be difficult easier. While I'd expect some to point out how such an argument is self-defeating, it starts to make sense the more you think about it. From here it's only a short jump, skip and hop for one to discover why Gaffigan's material is as versatile as it is.",1316476800,,2755,4.408644400785855

He starts off with a bit, talking in a hushed squeaky voice, acting like he's speaking for supposed members of the audience. Much of the phrases he speaks aren't funny in the least and make no sense whatsoever. He continues to do stuff like that off and on through the entire show. If this is his gimmick, I do not understand his popularity. It's lame and not funny. Finally he gets into making comments about life, but they are not original, they are not funny; it's just dull observations with no wit. I guess that's a better term than ""lame."" This guy is dull.

It's a little funny here and there, but drove me a bit batty after a while. I am a christian, but don't hold that against me here.  I only audibly giggled when he actually talked about Jesus. For instance, Jesus getting socks as a gift or when Moses may have said ""tada"" after parting the Red Sea.  If you want some great laughs, check out Tim Hawkins.  His latest ""insanitized"" is awesome and can literaly be watched by anyone.  Tim does not use language or innapropriate innuendoes, like Jim here.

2452276,5,B000C20VIW,"Do you like to laugh? Then buy this DVD!

Really, it's that simple.

Jim Gaffigan is hysterical. And clean enough to watch with your parents. You can probably watch this with your kids, too. I'm not sensitive to swearing or dirty jokes - in fact you could probably call me a fan of such things - but that's not Gaffigan's schtick. If you don't like swearing and bathroom humor, then you're safe with this one.

Instead, you get all the classics: ""Hot Pockets"", ""Guess It's Chocolate For Me"" and more -  most of his classics are here.  If you're already a fan of Gaffigan, then this one is a ""must have."" And if you want to know what everyone if laughing at and why Jim Gaffigan has so many fans, then you should definitely check this one out.

If you've seen him on Comedy Central (or lucky you ""live in concert"") then you'll want to own this. If large pale men speaking in high whispery ding-song voices amuse you, then I urge you to purchase this DVD. If laughing your ass off then spending the next week driving your friends to either amusement or distraction by quoting all the best parts is your thing then this is the stand up DVD for you!

And if you really want the last laugh - buy it used from a well rated Amazon Marketplace merchant (like I did) and save money, too. You'll be laughing all the way to the bank!",1265414400,,1322,4.306451612903226

Though I was not familiar with much of his work (I've only seen a few of his guest spots on shows), I was very happy with his stand up.  He has a knack for tackling observational humor in a unique way, in that he would not see a glass as half full or empty, but wonder what the liquid inside was, and if it was edible.  His humor is non-offensive, in that its not crude, but remains witty and smart.  Very funny, and certainly entertaining.

As to the DVD, there are a few special features, most of which aren't that impressive.  The stand out to me was Gaffigans first stand up attempt. It was interesting to see how he changed, both physically, as well as the content of his jokes (earlier gaffigan was a bit dirty).

We were so disappointed when his show was sold out in our area. BUT we were just able to go see him just a few weeks ago at the Landmark Theater in Richmond, VA. OH MY GOD were we so happy we made the 4 hour drive. Not only was it a new routine (which I thought 'how on earth can he top what he's done already?')  but it was as side splittingly funny as what we'd already seen on TV. We would have been more than happy to see his old HBO routine but were so thrilled to see a whole new set and now have even more funny quotes to throw around to each other!! (Is he wearing girl jeans?-Are they Jordache?)
I've never written a review in my entire life but I just have to comment and support Jim and his work. My husband and I both think he is the greatest comedian EVER. His humor will have your face covered in tears and your stomach cramping from laughing. And it's such a 'light-hearted' comedy that it makes you feel so good!! I just bought the DVD so that I can first of all, watch it over and over again. But so that I can give it to my friends and family who haven't had the good fortune of knowing what it's like to be a part of the Gaffigan family. And quite honestly, he is such a nice person, you really do feel like you are a part of his extended family.

2452302,5,B000C20VIW,"This DVD is one of the funniest works of comedy that I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Jim Gaffigan is not only the most talented comedian who is performing today, he is also one of the most family-friendly entertainers as well. There are a few words used that cause those of us who are more conservative to wince -- and some who are evangelical Christians like myself may find some of the religious humor objectionable. However, the vast majority of the material is very clean and downright funny. Parents should watch the DVD first to determine if they deem it suitable for their older children. I enjoyed the privilege of meeting Mr. Gaffigan in person after his recent performance in Tulsa and he is a thoroughly decent and very kind man.",1216252800,,748,4.674242424242424
2452303,5,B000C20VIW,It gets funnier everytime I watch it... The best and cleanest stand up routine I've ever seen. If you don't like it... you have a very poor sense of humor.,1214265600,,155,4.2
2452304,4,B000C20VIW,"I've seen Jim G on tv for years, from Conan O'Brien to Comedy Central. I have his previous work, Doin' My Time, which is also great so I bought this. It's at least as funny as the other DVD with some added material that's a little odd but entertaining. His work is easier to take than Dane Cook or Lewis Black, very little profanity and he makes fun of himself a lot. Not quite as much as Brian Regan who is also great, but I can't help but laugh at his little self-commentary in sotto voce, as if he's speaking for an audience member criticizing his work. Very original and hilarious. If I had any complaint it would be that there are no episodes of Pale Force included but they're available on the net so it's not a big deal, it just would have been convenient to have it all on one disk. If you like stand-up and have kids or don't care to listen to endless profanity, get this DVD and a Hot Pocket and enjoy.",1214092800,2,912,4.15819209039548

His ""Hot Pockets"" section is probably the most famous and I'll find myself bringing it up with my friends all the time.  His inner voice that keeps coming out during the show are very funny too and are often exactly what the audience is thinking.  My favorite parts would have to be his descriptions of holidays, especially Christmas (""If you think about it, the traditions surrounding Christmas sound more like the actions of a drunk man!"").  He does spend a lot of time joking about food but it never gets old and I just want to hear more! (""IHOP?  They should rename it 'I Barely Move')  There are so many quotable moments that you'll keep bringing up in conversations with others that have seen it!

This is definately a comedy video worth buying and showing to friends/company  until they've all become Gaffiganized!  The comedy routine is about an hour and a half or so and there are a few extras with the DVD including a funny bit about him coming to Chicago and making it big ;)",1208995200,,1201,4.463302752293578

The thing that clenches it for me is he comes up with this woman heckler character that comments on his entire act as he does it, it's hilarious. If you like his type of humor then you should like it but who knows, but if you have no idea who this guy is or have only heard his name and not seen him definately order this now!

2452316,5,B000C20VIW,"Jim Gaffigan is one of the funniest comedians on tour that doesn't have the big name appeal that a Lewis Black or Dane Cook may. His humor consists of eating and being lazy, which most of us can relate to! 99% of his humor does not consist of swearing or off-color topics, so you can show this dvd to just about any audience (and I don't mind comedians that swear, one of my favorites is Robert Schimmel).

If there were an art form of self deprocation, Jim Gaffigan would be a Da Vinci! He makes us all feel better for taking naps, not wanting to do laundry, and watching the food network with our pants off. I've seen Jim live and his act is non-stop laughter as well. We can all relate to Jim Gaffigan and if you have a goofy sense of humor, you will love this DVD (the cd that goes along well with it is ""Doin My Time"" which is also great and ties in some of the same jokes... but definitely not all).",1205107200,,905,4.112994350282486
2452317,5,B000C20VIW,"After catching a few bits of Jim Gaffigan's routine on Comedy Central one evening, I had to have his special ""Beyond the Pale"" on DVD. Already, my boyfriend and I have watched it 4 times, laughing equally as hard as we did the first.

The big test was our 9 year old: we skipped to a few of the bits that were age appropriate--""hot pockets"" and ""cake""--and by the next family gathering, he was quoting parts of Jim's routine much to the delight of the whole family. And especially us. There is NOTHING like seeing your son laughing so hard no sound comes out. That's just every parents' dream, isn't it? :)

Highly recommend this DVD...I've already gotten my money's worth and then some. I love Jim Gaffigan! He is relevent, off the wall, original, and on the edge of taboo/shocking--enough so that you get that guilty pleasure of a stifled guffaw or two.",1204502400,,855,4.545454545454546

And then, I saw his stand up. I have cried from laughing so hard, not that often in my life, but this was different. This was the kind of laughing that made you cry, and catch your breath, and seriously, I coudlnt, and still cant get the smile off my face when i watch, or think of his comedy.

He's completely clean and definitely family-friendly.  In fact, my family watched it last christmas--ages 17 to 84!  If you're even thinking you might like this, you should treat yourself.  You won't be disappointed.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, is because this is aimed almost exclusively at the American market. A lot of the references don't make immediate sense, and this does detract from the enjoyment.

Though Gaffigan will not offend many people or shock anyone out of the room, the inner voice bit is annoying to no end. For every joke or comment he makes he adds a high-pitched ""inner voice"" comment. The crowd appears to be puzzled by this as well and he even makes fun of himself for doing it...in the annoying inner voice pitch.

2452347,5,B000C20VIW,"I loved Jim Gaffigan's comedy routine since I first saw it on Comedy Central about a year ago, I loved it so much that I knew that I wanted it on DVD! Beyond the pale is the kind of thing that you can watch again & again, and still be howling with laughter until you're sore in the cheeks!
Beyond the Pale mainly focuses on food, holiday traditions, a little bit of religious humor, (the funny kind) and well...Hot Pockets.
It's family friendly, Gaffigan never resorts to raunchy humor or over-the-top cussing to get laughs like so many other comedians these days... Instead, he mainly bases his routine on observational humor, personal opinion, and this little voice that he does that's supposed to be what the people in the audience are thinking while he does his routine. The ""little audience voice"" is very funny, no comedian has ever done such a thing during their routine, and it'll leave you howling with laughter at certain points of his routine!

For those of you, like myself, who've already seen Beyond the Pale on Comedy Central, I recommend that you buy this DVD anyway. Comedy Central cut about a half an hour worth of skits from it to save time, and they're all hilarious and shouldn't be missed!

If you like family friendly stand up comedy that you can watch again & again, then you can't go wrong with Gaffigan!",1186012800,,1329,4.60337552742616

Additionally, the material is about 98% clean and quite appropriate in comparison to other things shown today.  I first saw the Comedy Central version and decided I needed to get the full version for myself.  I knew it would be funny, but it turned out to be spectacular.

I showed it to my friends a few days after I got it, and some of them actually bought it for themselves the next day.

The extra stuff in the DVD is kind of boring, but it is definately it just for the main feature.

This guy is so funny. I really enjoy his stand up.

You get some extra goodies on the DVD including Jim's first ever stand up performance (at least the first one ever recorded). His style was a lot different back then but still funny. It's interesting to see the difference though.

Anyway, I give this a 5/5 because I love his work.

If you like Jim, check out some of Dane Cook and Ron White (They call me Tater.... Tater Salad.)

I am so glad I bought this, it has been so worth it and gotten so much time from my DVD player.  We are always quoting from this, just so much of it is so true!

Most people will recognize him from the Sierra Mist commercials, as most people will recognize Brian Posehn from Just Shoot Me, but he's so much more than a stand in for a soft drink.  I don't even know what to label his style of humor - it's not toilet humor and it's not stupid humor, it's more of a dry-catch them off guard, style of humor, and it works ten fold.

This DVD in particular is a goldmine, his bit on traditions is probably the funniest thing in the whole set, but the entire, what's it? 71 minutes? is comedic genius.

One of the elements that separates him from other comedians is he has this tendancy to act as a ""split personality"" who's overly critical of his act and uptight.

2452451,5,B000C20VIW,"Get this DVD, this guy is super funny, this DVD is great fun.  I saw him live in Washington DC a few years ago and I almost passed out from laughing so much. His material is awesome and you can watch his show over and over and find yourself laughing out loud every time.

Highly recommended,

10 stars!",1139011200,2,302,4.172413793103448
2452452,5,B000C20VIW,I was at the taping of his show in Chicago and it was one of the best acts I have ever seen! I caught the comedy central special and can say it was even funnier on TV. Great clean comedy is hard to find today.,1138579200,5,209,3.6666666666666665
2452453,5,B000C20VIW,"Just watched it last nite on comedy central. Freaking funny as hell. One of my fav comedians. Jim, You Rock!",1138579200,4,108,4.45
2452454,5,B000C20VIW,"I've always been strangely drawn by Jim Gaffigan's brand of comedy. It seems that his first impression would never seem to be a good one. He doesn't look quite healthy, he speaks softly, and some of his jokes are barely coherent and follow little rhyme or reason. Yet, he is one of the most entertaining men I've ever seen in my life. I would urge anyone who hasn't seen him to do so, because it truly is quite a treat.",1138579200,4,419,4.25
2452455,5,B000C20VIW,"I just watched a special on Comedy Central earlier tonight of this DVD. Granted, it was only 40 minutes of it, but it was amazing. All of the sketches were great, as usual - he made great use of the inside voices ""But I like Pandas,"" ""This guy isn't very nice,"" and ""He's going to hell in two different religions."" Obviously, I can't do justice to it, you'd have to see it for yourself... absolutely glorious. He also goes on a rant about hot pockets for 10 minutes... soo funny.. ""hooooooooottt pooockkkeeeetttt.""

You should definitely get this DVD, I know I'm going to",1138492800,14,571,4.543689320388349
2452456,5,B000C20VIW,"HOOOOOT POCKET!!!

I will be going to see Jim for the 5th time this month here in Houston, Jim is BY FAR the best standup I've ever seen and I see lots of standup (I like my comedy dirty or clean)... I love all the ""inside voices"" he does and when he first gets on stage and says.. ""YAY, hurray, YAY.. I don't know me either!!"" I love his CDs and hope this DVD is just as good.. Also a word of warning, if you talk at one of Jims show get ready for the ""chit chat, chit chat"" LMAO just thinking about it..

Back to the DVD

ONLY Ten Dollars for JIM COME ON, you gotta buy it!!

Jim if you read this congrats on your new baby I hope you get her a nice pizza box to play with!!

2452457,5,B000C20VIW,"I was in Chicago at the Vic Theatre the day that this was taped, and all I have to say is the show was great.  Jim put on an amazing show for us, and uses a lot of new material, and even some really good jokes from his ""Doing My Time CD/DVD"".  The show lasted just under an hour from what I remember and was well worth attending.

All I would say is if you like to laugh, or like cake, this DVD is for you.  (once you see the show, you will understand what I mean about cake)",1135555200,17,475,3.7676767676767677
