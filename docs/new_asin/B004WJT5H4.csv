4486577,5,B004WJT5H4,"I haven't actually played any of the disks yet, but for those of you weary of buying this set after the previous Stargate Atlantis Complete Series DVD packaging fiasco, I wish to ease your worries. The packaging is sturdy. There is no paper. There are three blu-ray cases in the box. The first two cases are, respectively, Seasons 1-2 & Seasons 3-4. The final case is Season 5. All the disks are mounted onto blue hard plastic just like standard blu ray multi-disk packs. As I said, I haven't played any of the disks yet. I know in the past there were issues with disks having the wrong episodes / missing episodes, etc. Hopefully that is not the case with this awesome blu-ray release. I will update my review with more information about the disk contents/quality later.",1311638400,27,771,4.635036496350365
4486578,5,B004WJT5H4,"I was glad MGM released Stargate Atlantis on Blu-Ray.  Before, the studio wasn't going to release it.  I was surprised they released all 5 seasons on Blu-Ray.  I thought they might do 1 season at a time.

This series deserved better treatment than it received.  It had great characters, great stories, great actors and directors.  At the end of Season 5 there were still plenty of stories to tell, plenty of things left to say.  It's a shame the movies were shelved (for now, let's hope).  Maybe, in the not-so-distant future, MGM will reconsider and produce new Stargate movies.",1310169600,10,579,4.777777777777778
4486579,5,B004WJT5H4,"One of the big arcs of the ""Stargate SG-1"" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis. It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually). And though it had a slightly shaky start -- much like its parent series -- the following seasons saw ""Stargate: Atlantis"" blossom out into a solid sci-fi series with a legendary series, new alien parasites, and new nasty machines from long ago.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) lets an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis, even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military personnel to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. After some initial problems, the ancient city is secured and has risen above the water -- but unfortunately the military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), have run afoul of the parasitic, life-sucking alien Wraith, who destroyed the Pegasus Ancients long ago.

And the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- nanoviruses, spies, life-sucking bugs, cannibal Wraith, enzyme addicts, whales, an egomaniac baker, weird Ancient devices, Wraiths transformed into humans (and vice versa), ""alternate reality drives,"" Ancient artifacts, crooked businessmen, fear machines, a race of hybrid bug monsters, crystalline nightmare aliens, and a race of ruthless soldiers pretending to be Amish-like farmers.

The Atlantis base regains contact with Earth, but this may not be enough to save them from the Wraith's attempts to gain control of Atlantis, and an Ancient experiment gone horribly wrong. At the same time, Atlantis receives two new commanders -- first Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), formerly of SG-1, and then the once-fussy Woolsey (Robert Picardo).

This series is less of a spinoff than a natural outgrowth of ""Stargate SG-1,"" and remains tightly tied to it -- the whole idea of the Atlantis base was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" some of the ""SG-1"" characters (and the Prometheus) were also recurring characters, and Tapping was a regular. Teal'c and Daniel even drop in. And while the first season is a bit bland (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you,"" Rodney snipes) the storyline hits its stride in the second season.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror (just look at Michael's ""experiments""). But it doesn't lose its laid-back style, and the dialogue is a pretty entertaining diversion from the body-horror Wraith, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges, with the occasional pop culture reference (""It's the ultimate answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything!""). Most are from Rodney (""Just once, I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien!""), and Sheppard (""But then I'd be The Man, and who would I have to rage against?""). But there's humor from everyone (""He put his hand in my forehead! How can you resist that?"" ""Well, I like to close my eyes and think of England""), including the Wraith (""I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them"").

One thing Atlantis does have is a high cast turnover, compared to the relatively unchanging cast of the previous series. But Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian snap to his performance (""I HATE clowns!""), David Hewlett is hilarious as the antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, Tapping and Wigginson are solid commanders, and Paul McGillion is adorable as a Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell and Jason Momoa are never quite as endearingly alien as SG-1's Teal'c (who makes a guest appearance), they are quite solid as a psychic martial-artist and a rough-edged warrior.

As for the long-waited blu-ray series release, they FINALLY released details on the extras. It looks like the extras are pretty much the same as in the standard DVDs, with lots of episode commentaries from actors, directors and producers, actor profiles, photo galleries, character introductions, set tours, ""mission directives,"" deleted scenes, and special behind-the-scenes featurettes focusing on unusual situations (""Dr Jackson Goes to Atlantis""). Among others.

""Stargate Atlantis"" loses a few too many cast members, but the storylines and aliens add a fresh dimension to the Stargate universe without losing their humor and horror. Definitely worth the while... but be up-to-date on the first series first.",1309219200,37,4773,5.204427083333333
4486580,4,B004WJT5H4,"It felt like they couldn't quite make up their mind about who should star in this series. The original cast was John, Teyla, Rodney, Aiden, Weir, and Beckett. Then they replaced Aiden with Ronen, Beckett with Keller, Weir with Sam, and Sam with Woolsey. For that reason the cast never seemed to gel quite as well as the original SG-1. Not all replacements were negatives. I liked Weir a lot, but wasn't sorry to see Sam join the cast. However, I was very unhappy to see Woolsey join the cast (I loved Robert Picardo on Voyager, but I could not stand his character on this show) and felt that the characters too readily accepted him replacing Sam. I absolutely loved Keller (maybe I'm just a Firefly sentimental--ps anyone notice that her eyes are really close together?), but again didn't particularly want to see Becket go. Ronen and Aiden were pretty interchangeably whatever for me.

I love how much crossover there is between the different series. Atlantis probably has the most crossover with characters and storylines since it overlapped with SG-1. (I remember watching SG-1, hearing a reference to the Wraith, and thinking, ""wait, who are the wraith?"") There are constantly references to things we saw in one series with the other, particularly with communication stones and matter bridges, not to mention a Goa'uld moment and a few Asgard and Replicator surprises.

This show also couldn't seem to handle letting their characters die, bringing them back over and over in one form or another (anyone else think it was weird that Repli-Weir looked different than original Weir and no one commented on it?), though we did finally have to let go of one main character. Personally, I would have been okay with getting rid of Rodney. He never grew on me because I could not handle his arrogance (even if it was legitimate at times). Though I did love seeing him and Ronen compete for Keller's affections. That was pretty cute in its way.

The Wraith problem was resolved a little too quickly in this show. I mean, it took like 8 years to finish the Goa'uld (and that wasn't even completely finished since they had all those Ba'al clones running around). But by season 3's end, most of the Wraith and the replicators were done. I know Sam is good (that Rodney ever thought he would be put in charge...) but still.

Biggest issue with the series: It always felt like there was supposed to be something between Teyla and John that somehow didn't materialize and then suddenly, there's Kanaan and she's pregnant. And everyone kept talking about how it was so obvious, the way she talked about him etc. Had she ever mentioned his name before?",1308614400,5,2639,4.7680525164113785
4486581,5,B004WJT5H4,"The sale price on this is a bargain for 100 hours of solid science fiction with a great cast, stories, and production values.

MGM has really been taking forever to get Stargate on blu-ray.  Let's hope SG1 gets a similar treatment

I'm buying this because it's a favorite show, but also to show my support for more Stargate in the future someday.  It's a shame SGU killed the franchise, I was looking forward to SG1 and SGA movies.",1307836800,13,431,4.487179487179487

Here's hoping!!!

UPDATE:
  I just bought the Blu-ray box set and I couldn't be happier! It's almost like watching it for the first time all over again. The only weak spot (sorta) in the HD is the first episode. After that the picture quality is second to none!

Now if only I could find someone who would appreciate my standard def dvd version of SGA. It's a shame that so few people like the shows I like.",1304121600,5,620,4.310344827586207
4486584,5,B004WJT5H4,"One of the best SF series, a spin-off of Stargate: SG-1.  This series was originally filmed in high definition and is finally being released on Blu-Ray discs.

Let's just say I never purchased the regular DVD set, knowing that someday, this set would be issued.

My pre-order went in the first day I was notified of the advance release.  I cannot wait until it arrives at my door.  Now I can see Stargate: Atlantis, in all its High Definition glory.  From its ancient beginnings, to its return to Earth in the final episode.

Will they include extras, commentary, and the like that we've come to expect with current Blu-Ray releases?  I certainly hope so!

Here's hoping that someday, they'll return to Atlantis, do a movie to finally finish off the evil Wraith.

4486766,5,B004WJT5H4,"Stargate Atlantis was a consistantly good series. It is a shame that it ended after five seasons. Everything was extremely well done. The stories were top notch. I found myself saying after a few of them, ""Now that's traditional sci-fi!"" Of course, there may be a few that are run-of-the-mill or a little boring, but this is seriously a good show.

The cast was excellent everything from the main cast, to the guest stars. They get rid of some characters sometimes for no real reason unfortunately, and almost anytime a clone is involved, they get killed! But, fans of the Stargate program will see people from the first series who make cameos, appearances, and even a whole season run!

The special effects of this series are great! They look really good in Bluray too and this Complete Series Set is very, very good. Even if you never saw the original Stargate television program, sci-fi fans can still enjoy this awsome show in it's own right. I'd rather see more of this Stargate than the ""new"" movie version of the original movie to be honest.",1478131200,6,1048,4.690217391304348
4486767,5,B004WJT5H4,"This is actually the first blu-ray I ever bought, shortly after it came out as a black Friday special.  At the time, the show wasn't available streaming anywhere and I'd only gotten through the first two seasons before Netflix separated streaming and DVD's.  I finally just decided to purchase the DVD's as I really loved the show, but saw some pretty negative reviews.  There weren't many (or possibly any) reviews of the blu-ray set when I purchased this set, but shortly after receiving it, I became extremely busy and didn't have much in the way of time for television watching for about two years.

A couple years ago I saw the blu-rays sitting there and thought, 'what the heck' and popped them in, all the way from the beginning.  And, I watched the whole series through in about a month.  Is this series ground-breaking?  Is it earth-shattering?  Is it something that will change something in you?  Probably not.  Is it fun, imaginative television with a pretty great cast throughout?  Heck yeah!

Also nice, this is a very clean (as in, pure as the driven snow) show.  After running through my watch-through, I showed the pilot to my mom, who'd adored Firefly.  And I truly think she liked this show more.  There's basically no sex on the show.  And though there's violence, it's rarely against humans.  And after watching through with Mom, Dad wanted to know what the show was about.  I'm pretty sure I watched this series through three times in one year.  And it almost never grew old.

Now, for the blu-ray's themselves.  While the series won't change your life, the blu-ray just might.  There are SO MANY COMMENTARIES.  SO MANY.  SO, SO MANY.  At least three quarters of the episodes have commentaries.  And, after the first season, I personally believe they started getting the right people to do the commentaries.  Season two on has either a show writer or a show director, and often has both.  This means that if you have the least bit of interest in the production of a television show, you'll actually get some really intriguing behind the scenes glimpses.  It's just neat to hear about different directors' styles and parse out just why one of them works better for you than the next.  And the same with the script-writing.

Finally, the other special features.  While you get some of the old standbys, you also get some really funny videos starring some of the directors/writers--and for me, this is worth every penny.

I know a lot of folks out there prefer SG-1 to SG-A, but for me there's just one name that explains why I'm an SG-A girl.  Martin Gero.  The man can write character, which is what I go to television for.

So yes, if you're on the fence, this set is very worth every penny in my opinion.  Unless you're not into sci-fi.  And then, maybe, you might want to check out a different show.

I normally don't double dip (especially when Blu-ray upgrades are expensive) but I saw this one as one of Amazon's Daily Deals for $40 and I realized that the time was right.  Wow, was it ever!  Minutes before buying this one (I mean, time is of the essence when you have such a great Daily Deal staring you in the face!), I checked out Blu-ray.com's review of the disc set, saw the high marks the set received and brought in an upgrade that was well worth the $40.  Seeing SGA in such a well-mastered Hi-Def upgrade is just a joy.  The video and audio upgrade breathes magic back into the series and for anyone with a good home theater experience, I can't recommend the upgrade to Blu-ray enough.  If you already own the DVD series as I did, look out for Amazon's next Daily Deal because this one won't disappoint you one bit!",1454803200,6,1039,4.529411764705882

So, I began keeping an eye out to buy it on dvd or blu-ray.  When I saw it on sale, I couldn't hit buy fast enough.  This is a series that my son and I have really enjoyed.  We started watching it again the night it arrived.  They couldn't have picked a better cast.  By far, one of my favorite SciFi tv series.",1437955200,2,457,4.067415730337078

So, I went in blind.  Watched it last winter and liked it a lot!  Okay, not every episode is a total winner.  Some of the repetition does get old.  And all of these sci-fi movies...okay, all fantasy moves...seem to suffer from fearful looking aliens that are stupid, not very competent and/or deadly.  And that failure falls on the writers.  It's up to them to make the show enjoyable and believable as the hero's survive seemingly insurmountable odds.  The classic example is Lord of the Rings.  Wow, those Orcs are easy to kill if you are one of the heros.  Still, LOTR is a classic.  So, bottom line...this series is well worth viewing...not quite up to the standards set by Firefly, but pretty close at times.",1435190400,,880,4.459119496855346

4486973,5,B004WJT5H4,"(NO SPOILERS)What can I say? Stargate fans will know exactly what this show is. Stargate Atlantis, the spin off created from Stargate SG:1. Features a team of space explorers who travel by means of something called a Stargate, a gigantic circle that creates a wormhole between itself and another Stargate. This show is set in the great lost city of Atlantis, unlike SG:1 where they are based on Earth. Atlantis takes us to a universe much farther than that of SG:1 so we get to meet a whole lot of new enemies and characters throughout this amazing universe. It has great Sci-fi action, lots of shooting and explosions, beautiful women, some tearjerkers, and of course some comedic arcs. The story will leave you wanting for more since the very last episode ends and leaves us asking many questions that will never be answered. The story needs an ending. Other than that its an amazing show. Also since this is blu-ray its Full HD and looks incredible.",1429142400,3,952,4.740963855421687

4487005,5,B004WJT5H4,"Minor complaint first: The quality of the first few seasons are... well they are certainly a bit rough.  720p was about as good as things got at the time, and I suspect that a lot of the CG work in the first few seasons was only 480p.  So for the first few seasons you have nice crisp 1080p titles, 720p video, and 480p graphics all sort of tossed together.  Thankfully as the show gains more budget, and better technology becomes available with time, these get much better and I think that the last 2 seasons have everything in full 1080p.  For me it was a little distracting, but I understand why it is the way that it is, and the rest of the show more than makes up for it, so I can't really take a star off.  Just know what you are getting.

As far as the show itself, while die-hard fans of the Stargate franchise would probably disagree, this is my favorite series that they completed (Stargate Universe was my favorite... but they killed that prematurely).  The writers do fall a bit into the writers trap of ""Rodney (or someone) breaks something, and watch Rodney fix it"" during filler episodes, but even these episodes are entertaining, and the main story ark episodes are very well done offering high stakes, epic battles, and some of the best enemies of the whole franchise.  If you want to get a feel for the overall franchise, then this (and the movie that started it all) would be a good place to start.  You can then go back and watch SG-1, but go into it understanding that it starts out extremely rough, and while the story gets better with time, some things about SG-1 simply do no hold up with time.  Atlantis however is pretty entertaining from beginning to end, and is far more accessible to a broader audience than your typical science fiction space-opera.",1419206400,10,1778,4.4937888198757765

4487011,3,B004WJT5H4,"While Stargate Atlantis is a pretty good show overall, I can only give this set three stars.  I have two major problems with it.  First is Torri Higginson's (Dr. Wier's) hideous acting.  She ruins every scene she's in with her high-school-play caliber lack of emotive ability and the way she sounds drunk every time she speaks because she can't enunciate.  And when she pronounced the word ""nuclear"" as nuke-yoo-ler, that sealed the deal for me.  THIS woman is supposed to be a scientist leading the world's most important mission??  Riiight.  Plus, she looks like an old man.  Doesn't help at all.

The second issue I have with this particular DVD set is technical: The sound quality is terrible.  The sound engineer who put it together should not be working in audio.  The music and sound effects are so loud that when you have the volume set at a reasonable level, you have to strain to hear dialog.  If you have the volume high enough to hear dialog, you blow out your speakers and eardrums when any music or effects play.  I thought the Amazon sale wherein I got this Blu-ray set for less than the original version was a deal.  But now I wish I'd gotten the original.  I think the sound guy incorporated this ""special"" sound to go with the enhanced Blu-ray visuals, and ruined the thing in the process.  (The Stargate SG1 original DVDs did not have this problem; the sound is done perfectly on them.)  That kind of ear-splitting volume works fine in a movie theater, but on a home DVD player it totally sucks.  It gets pretty tiresome having to adjust the volume 30 times during each episode.  I have to turn it up whenever anyone's talking.  Except Torri Higginson.  I leave the volume low for her.",1417651200,2,1704,4.59468438538206

My sister gave me the Blu-Ray as a present, and while the picture quality is great, the discs do not ""remember"" where you were when you stop watching.  When you turn the player back on, it asks, ""Resume Playback?"", and after you select ""Yes"", it takes you back to the beginning of the first episode on the disc, no matter where you were.  It's really aggravating.
  Stargate Atlantis was a spinoff from Stargate SG-1, taking place in the Pegasus Galaxy,  The main players were Dr. Elizabeth Weir, Col. John Sheppard, Dr. Rodney McKay, Dr. Carson Beckett (all from Earth), Teyla Emmagen and Ronan (both from the Pegasus Galaxy).  The cast changed after the third season, and I still believe the first three seasons were the best, with more tightly written and engaging stories.  The fourth and fifth seasons had some good episodes, but I felt the cast change took some of the heart out of the series.  Still highly recommended, but on HD.",1408665600,,1037,4.622950819672131

Don't ask me about the ""special features"", like many others, knowing how the trick was done ruins the effect when you watch the performance. Likewise, I could care less about the opinions of the director, or the actor's personal lives. To me, Daniel Jackson is Daniel Jackson. Knowing he is an actor with a different life only subtracts from the realism of experiencing the series. The price of this set is very reasonable, and if you donate your DVD set to a charitable organization you get the write off, making it even more affordable, as well as letting someone with less to spend the chance to see the Atlantis Adventure!

4487162,5,B004WJT5H4,"This series is one that is definitely worth owning on Blu-ray, not just because of the extras, not just because it has strong visual effects that benefit from the sharper resolution, but because it's one of the few series that drags you back again and again. I'm not certain how many times I've gone through the 100 episodes of Stargate: Atlantis, but if I did, It would probably be so embarrassingly high I wouldn't say. In a lot of ways, this show is a kind of guilty pleasure. It belongs to an entirely different branch on television's evolutionary tree than shows like Breaking Bad, The Wire, Rome, Game of Thrones, and The Sopranos. It was a spinoff of a spinoff, with a modest budget and meager studio expectations. And as much as I love the show, the fact that in the 15 season history of Atlantis and SG-1 they never dealt with the stupidity of every alien in two galaxies speaking English -- when you can't go a city block without running into language problems -- is an indicator of how seriously the producers took the show (to be fair, blame rests with the original showrunners of SG-1; after leaving it unaddressed for the first couple seasons, it was too late. All the writers could do was 'hang a lantern on it' every so often, smile and shrug). But it did have some talented writers, like Martin Gero, whose skill with witty dialogue helped make Dr. Rodney MacKay and Lt. Colonel John Shepherd such memorable characters, and whose scientific knowledge aided with introducing some conceptual vigor to storylines. Carl Binder and SG-1 standouts Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie were also key factors in the show's appeal. And of course, the cast was likely the show's strongest element. Finding Joe Flanigan for the part of John Shepherd was a stroke of luck; his charisma and wry, laid-back sense of humor made him as strong a lead as Richard Dean Anderson was for SG-!. But David Hewlett, bringing his obnoxious, arrogant, but oddly compelling portrayal of MacKay from guest spots on SG-1 to Atlantis, was unquestionably the series' most memorable character, a perfect counterpoint to the whitebread perfection of Samantha Carter. Like Hewlett, Torri Higginson was introduced on SG-1, appearing in season 8 as Dr. Elizabeth Weir, replacing the actress originally picked to play Weir in the season 7 finale. Higginson was excellent in Atlantis, portraying Weir as an intelligent, compassionate, yet effective leader, willing to take good advice, but decisive and always able to make the hard decisions. I personally thought it was a mistake to (kind of) kill off her character in season 4 to make room for Col. Carter as new leader of the Atlantis Expedition, but the move obviously made sense to studio execs looking to ensure SG-1 fans made the jump to the Pegasus Galaxy. Amanda Tapping was fine, but bailed after one season; instead of writing Weir back in, Star Trek: Voyager and Stargate veteran Robert Picardo took over.
There have been many occasions when I've been reminded of how entertaining Atlantis was; while not every episode was great, 9 out of every 10 were at the least enjoyable, a far higher percentage than most series can boast. For me, Stargate: Atlantis stands the test of repeated viewings better than series that are, in most ways, superior. The Sopranos and Breaking Bad were masterpieces, but there's no way I want to watch them again every few months. Atlantis can be returned to in the same way The Simpsons: Season 3 - 10 or Seinfeld can be returned to. And as thoroughly watchable as the original Star Trek and it's followup series can be, at best 6 episodes out of 10 stand up... which makes Atlantis one of the most logical boxset-Bluray purchases around, regardless of the much-maligned packaging. If only they could have had another couple seasons... oh well, 100 episodes is a mark few shows get to hit.",1403481600,3,3854,4.8144796380090495

4487178,5,B004WJT5H4,"I bought this with the complete series of SG-1 and just recently finished watching all 15 season of Stargate! I have to say, I like Atlantis much better than SG-1. The Wraith are much better antagonists than the Goa'uld and there is less of the Egyptian/folklore mythology, so the writers can concentrate on real sci-fi. The spaceships look like spaceships, not ridiculous looking pyramids. It's not that I don't like SG-1, I loved it. In fact, I am now a much bigger fan of either Stargate than any of the Star Trek series (I have every series on DVD). I just liked Atlantis and cast better than SG-1.

As for the box set, I did not have any problems with any of the discs. The video and sound were good on my 24"" Insigna TV and Samsung sound bar. If you liked Stargate SG-1, Star Trek or Sci-Fi, you must buy this series/set. You will enjoy it!",1390608000,2,846,4.388535031847134

You will find a case holding season 1 and 2. Then 3 and 4.
5 is by itself in a thinner case. I wish every season had its own individual case like 5, but it's not a big deal.

Check your discs: my blu ray set had three copies of season 1 disc 1. I was missing season 1 discs 3 and 4. I have requested a replacement set from Amazon and am not too worried about them following through (hope I didn't jinx myself).

4487214,5,B004WJT5H4,"While revisiting this series, my mind keeps going over why they ever decided on a overly-serious follow up to this, (SGU).
This show could have gone on for at least 2 more seasons with the new developments introduced during series 4 and 5.

The show suffered some changes to the cast which I think radically altered the feeling of the show.
The revolving door of main leads during seasons 4 and 5 was unwelcome.
This was done because the producers had let go of Dr. Weir due to the fact that for 3 previous seasons, they did not know what to do with her.

Also, I never felt the Wraith were ever a worthy nemesis of the Atlanteans/Ancients. They seemed silly when the series actually explained how they came about. At best, they should have been eliminated completely from the plot by series 4 onward. Their constant appearance I think really weakened the series.
The other nemesis that continued to have a presence throughout was the human-form replicators. They needed to be gone too.
The series should have continued with the ""evil Asgards"" and a new element/nemesis.
The series finale with the Wraith reaching Earth was huge let-down, IMHO.

Still, I love the sci-fi action, the comraderie between the actors/characters.
The space candy scenes are also impressive for a TV serial budget for its time.
The theme music is also quite memorable.",1377129600,,1345,4.788793103448276

I did read in the other reviews on this series about problems with the DVD boxed set.  Based on those reviews, and that I did not see any reports on the Blu Ray set, I opted for the Blue ray set, even though it was a bit more expensive.

So far I have not had any problems with the disks in terms of removing them from the case.  I'll update this if I run into problems, but so far so good.

The Blu Ray menu (I don't know if the DVD menus are the same), however is clunky.  You have to use the arrow buttons on the controller to scroll through the various episodes.  In most cases this would not be a big deal since there is a Play All option, but to get to other episodes individually you need to scroll right then scroll down to get to Play Episode.  Not a huge problem, but it took a few minutes to figure it out; I didn't want to watch Rising again since I have the original release and had just watched it.",1375660800,2,1115,3.981981981981982

4487250,4,B004WJT5H4,"Nice series in a above average package. Waited about buying the complete series due to earlier problems with packaging poorly from customers reviews. Caught the blu ray set on sale for $55 & bought it at Amazon. You can't beat $11 each season on blu ray series.
The new packaging for the complete series corrects the problems earlier customers mentioned. Although the complete series is in a space saving boxed set ALL DISCS ARE WELL PROCTED, easily removable discs, & all blu ray discs played without a hitch. Clean & clear picture.
If the series is of interest, put it in your wish list & watch for it being on sale. Patience can get you the complete series at a great price. You can get most series or individual blu ray movies 60 to 75 percent off by putting them in your wish list & being patient for them to go on sale.
Stargate:Atlantis takes a little getting into as it is a different flavor than Stargate:SG1, but well worth watching.

Atlantis was a risky spinoff from SG1 but it was well produced and directed with well written storylines.  The Blu-ray collection is simply beautiful.  Picture & sound are great and perhaps best of all you can actually resume the disc where you left off.  All too many blu-ray discs make you start over if you power off your player and return to it later.  Every vendor should do this.

To be able to watch it now in Hi-Def resolution and wide screen is amazing.  I purchased the series when Amazon had its recent sale for the complete series of both Atlantis (Blu-ray) and SG-1 (DVD) at $55 apiece.  I am now through seasons 1 and 2 of Atlantis, and the quality of the sound and picture are both excellent.  I have not yet watched the extras or listened to comments, so cannot comment about them, but for anyone who enjoyed the Stargate series, Atlantis on Blu-ray is a no-brainer.

4487322,5,B004WJT5H4,"Atlantis has always been one of my favorite TV Shows. Atlantis was the first series of the Stargate Franchise to be filmed in HD.  I own a lot of Blu Ray Sets, and i can tell you that this Atlantis Set is one of the most high quality set's i own.

The Box is nice and compact, with great Atlantis Art.  The Blu Ray disc Holders are the expensive high quality holders that set the bar for multi-disc packs.  Each disc has plenty of room around it, which makes removal and placement very easy.  The bindings that hold the Blu Ray Tray's togather are molded plastic which is a big plus. No more cardboard thank god!

The Special Features are spread out among the disc, with each disc containing from 3-4 special features. Each disc also offers a commentary version, where directors, actors, writers, and producers talk about their challenges and decisions that went into making each episode.  The special features really give you insight into the film industry and how shows are produced.

This box set was also very affordable. Stargate Atlantis was such a great show, i hated to see it go. Stargate Atlantis was the epiphany of the golden years for the SciFi Channel (now know as SyFy). Since then, SyFy has lowered its bar for tv shows and is mostly reality ghost hunting shows and wrestling.

Dont miss out on a great set with a legendary cast. It's of very high quality and you cant beat the price that Amazon offers.

Pro's:

* Compact Set
* Great Box Art
* Ultra High Quality Disc Holders
* Great Special Features
* Very Affordable

I didn't realize there were actually any stars rendered in the background for the space scenes in that episode as it looks just like a completely black background, except for a few nebulas and a galaxy, when the episode was aired and reruned on SciFi/Syfy. I'm glad that they chose DTS-HD over TruHD for audio encoding as the later has caused playback issues on my blu-ray player in the past with a several movies. I can't say much about the 5.1 surround sound audio quality as I primarily listen using headphones so just 2.1 stereo mode for me and I'm very pleased with the quality over all, including video of course. :)

Over all I'm very pleased with the set even though parts of the blue casing was cracked upon delivery on the edging of the discs enclosure, but none of the discs were damaged nor does it effect the ability to close the enclosure completely. So that's not bothering me much. So, if you're wanting to view Stargate Atlantis in its intended visual glory then the blu-ray box set is definitely for you.",1354579200,4,1225,4.518018018018018

Delivers superb, studio quality sound on my 5.1 speakers, the box says 5.1 audio.

Delivers crisp, popping HD on my 1080p LCD monitor.
Box says widescreen but it plays fullscreen on my 23.6"" monitor, although this may be due to the fact the flix are 1080p and my monitor is 1080p.

I haven't watched any bonus material yet, but it looks loaded with it.

Worth it !

Don't waste your money on this boxset in DVD, the DVDs are clearly no good. Get the bluray, mine play excellent, packaging is excellent. I'm savoring every episode. Get the Bluray !!!

He had asked for it on DVD but Amazon was running a great bargain on the blurays at around $75 + shipping so I snapped them up. He was really excited & says the viewing quality is great. I haven't watched them with him because, well, I'd rather jump off a cliff & crash to my ultimate doom than watch Stargate. :D He feels the same way about watching my chick flicks so it's all good. The packaging is not as nice as the original Stargate DVD box set. He liked that because it just looked super cool & the DVD's were organized nicely. But the packaging with this set of blurays are sturdy & there's no concern about scratching them or anything. We bought the Newsradio series on DVD a year or so ago & the packaging on that is super crappy. The discs literally sit one on top of the other basically in a box with nothing separating them or keeping them from scratching. So after that whole thing with Newsradio, we're always happy with packaging that protects our discs. I wish I could write a lot more about the shows, the extras & etc. but that would mean I had to sit through hours of aliens & such madness. ;) For those that love Stargate, such as my super cool husband, this is a nice set & what I paid was a great price.",1325030400,3,1280,4.165322580645161

4487361,5,B004WJT5H4,"The STARGATE ATLANTIS series was at the height of its popularity. The writing was superb, the show's cast exceptional and there was plenty of room for more adventure (such as maybe the Goa'uld infecting the Wraith and creating a whole new enemy bent upon conquest as well as feeding). So what did they do? The Sy-Fi Channel canceled it in order to give us the present line of garbage (cheaply made garbage at that!). Unfortunately, I have watched my DVD set of this series so much that I doubt I could squeeze any more enjoyment out of it. And let's face it, the show had a lot of cheap painted sets that really don't gain anything from high definition.

The initial idea was to do better quality movies and sell them via DVD/Blu-Ray, but after two STARGATE SG-1 features, everything came to a grinding halt! The ARK OF TRUTH opened with beautiful scenery in snow-capped mountains, then immediately jumped to a cheap cardboard set. And many STARGATE fans are still peeved that no explanation was given as to how everyone on a distant galaxy spoke English. Surely the Ancients wouldn't have linked two galaxies with stargates and not had some provision for communication. But this was something that could have been explained, yet wasn't for 300 episodes of two series!

I'd like to see a comparison of the high-def and standard def before I go for the Blu-Ray, but based on the feedback here, I might go for it. I just think it was a shame for the Sy-Fy Channel to cancel the two best series it ever produced. Even the STARGATE UNIVERSE series grew on me, but the Blu-Ray release was virtually indistinguishable from the regular definition. I fear the same would be true of the STARGATE ATLANTIS series.",1323820800,,1703,4.673333333333333

This series is more science oriented as, the science member of the team, Rodney McKay, saves the day more frequently than the action figure, John Shepard (unlike SG-1).  I like science stuff as well as action so this fit right into the category of Star-Trek (Enterprise), Indiana Jones, ect.

Due to the negative shipping reviews of the DVD series, I bought the Blu-ray series so I didn't have to worry about any of the CDs being scratched up.  There have been no problems with my discs and I am on the 3rd season of the 5.

4487378,5,B004WJT5H4,"In 2004 SciFi channel created the first spinoff to the long running series Stargate:SG-1, taking this fictional universe to the next level by telling new adventures with a new cast in a fictional galaxy neighboring our own Milky Way.  With a similar team format to SG1, this series features all new enemies and a further expansion to the lore of the Ancients, creating another popular and well-loved show in its own right, sometimes outshining it's parent series at times.  Unfortunately due to ratings and harsh executive decision making, Atlantis experienced an early death after only 5 seasons in 2009 and many sad fans were left wondering what if?  the series went on another 2-3 seasons, what directions the show and storyline could have evolved.

While this series has been previously released in its entirety on DVD, it had only received the bluray HD treatment in the rather oddly named 'fans choice' bluray collection which featured the pilot ... and series finale.  C'mon I'm pretty sure the fans chose more eps than that!

Flashforward to 2011 and lo an behold, the entire series finally gets released with the full bluray treatment, capturing the 720p broadcast resolution, while not as sharp as 1080p, since it was filmed, the series still looks great and also sounds great. 20 discs are spread across 3 cases which come in a nicely illustrated box for easy access and shelving.  All discs come with the extras featured on the DVDs, but in SD.

With the series itself, SG:Atlantis continues the 'bright' sci-fi tone established in SG-1 with the same mix of action, drama and smartly written dialogue with a humor that sometimes pushes the 4th wall.  I think the standout stars of this new series include Joe Flannigan, playing Col. John Sheppard and everyone's favorite arrogant scientist Dr Rodney McKay, played by actor extraordinaire David Hewlitt.  Tori Higginson continues her role as Elizabeth Weir from the original series but after her departure in season 4 shes replaced by a rotating cast of returning characters including Samantha Carter as Atlantis leader and the unlikely but sublime Robert Picardo as Woolsey.

Story arcs like the coninuing conflict against the Wraith, Replicators, Wraith Michael and the hybrids, run thru multiple seasons with events from earlier seasons having impact on much later ones.  But the real magic of the show is the ensemble cast and the wonderful, snappy dialogue between characters.  Plus we really get to see characters evolve, grow, and sometimes act like real people, giving it a charm and empathy absent in a lot of scifi series (looking at you Star Trek).  Even initially unlikeable characters like McKay and Woolsey from SG-1 evolve and gain depth to become much more complex characters and heroes in their own right.

I could talk on about the series but I'll end it here, just adding that I paid $95 new for this series, and for what is 100 eps across 20 bluray discs, this is a phenomenal bargain for SG or scifi fans alike.",1316649600,4,2993,4.934262948207171
4487379,5,B004WJT5H4,"The blu-ray DVD's are great.  Beyond the standard DVD set, in the blu-ray, you can watch each episode with or without the commentary.  There's something special about listening to the actor's talk about the scenes.  I think if you're looking to indulge in the story-line, than you should watch the entire series without commentary.  Listening to Joe and the others talk about the scenes sort of takes the magic out of the whole plot.  The thing I liked about the SG-1 and SGA series is that even though there's TONS of fiction, its more realistic fiction- so you can enjoy the story-line because it just doesn't seem that far out.  ...I know....I know....wraith are pretty far out, but the way this series and its predecessor played out, its just really enjoyable to watch.  It lets the worries of this economy and the junk that's going on in our society just melt away for that hour or two or three...depending how many you decide to watch.  I'm just getting through all the episodes with commentary and I really like listening to the actor's talk.

That said, watch the DVD's as fast as you can.  I already found one disc that has a distortion on it.  It's probably coming up on or past the refund date, which is completely unfair when it comes to DVD sales.  How are we the consumer suppose to watch an entire television series within the 30 day return period?  Then when you do run into a disc with a problem, its to late...your just S.O.L.  I don't downgrade my rating because the show was great and what they tried to do with putting them on disc makes it something even greater.  I just don't like how these company's manufacture a product and can't seem to get it right!  At the very least, they could offer an extended return period so that we'd have the time to watch the discs.  It's no fun to have to rush through hours upon hours of Atlantis just to make sure the DVD's are in perfect working order- that just makes it a chore.

Overall, I'd say buy it.  Just try to do your best to buy it during a period of time when you can dedicate many hours/nights to Atlantis.  You want to make sure you can still return any defective units before the refund period is up.",1316390400,,2175,4.430730478589421
4487380,5,B004WJT5H4,"** 12/18/2011: Updated review since initial writing due to progress in the series (currently about to finish season 4)**

I have been failing to keep myself from indulging in all five seasons, because they are so damn amazing. I want to make it last, but it's difficult to do. That's how great Stargate is to many fans. I began with the cult classic SG-1 series, and shotgunned through all 10 seasons in a couple of months. I was hungry for more, and Atlantis was the obvious choice.

Stargate: Atlantis is a VERY worthy follow up to the cult classic SG-1 series. Hands down.

> I won't spoil anything in the show for you, but I must say the cast of characters is charismatic, entertaining, and a joy to watch. While the foundation of characters does not stay as permanent as SG-1 managed, it was more or less for the better (depending on the character).

> The villains are great, and mature as the show progresses. You will enjoy the encounters between and with the crew of Atlantis :)

> There is VERY little ""meh"" episodes compared to SG-1 (although SG-1 didn't have many either). I'm very surprised in the percentage of excellent episodes. The writers perfected their craft obviously.

> The graphical and sound effects are top notch for the time they were filmed (within the realm of a TV studio budget). Some of the shots of Atlantis are still amazing.

> Weren't it for the mismanagement by MGM, I guarantee you Atlantis could have easily went 10+ seasons (and SG-1 would have went at least 12 to fully flesh out the Ori story arc). If you are going to prematurely end a show to birth another spin-off, give the loyal fans a proper send off with a straight-to-DVD movie(s) to conclude the series.

Bottom line: If you loved Stargate SG-1, then Stargate: Atlantis is right up your alley. It's a different flavor on the formula, and one that I (and many others) enjoy immensely!

Quick tidbits about the Blu-ray: I have a quality Sharp 1080P HDTV with a very competent 5.1 surround system and the picture quality and audio quality are amazing!

For those who are curious, SG-1 will most likely not make it to Blu-ray anytime soon due to the first couple of seasons being shot with a cheap camera. It would require individual scanning of each frame (i.e., a lot of money the studio likely won't spend) to receive the Blu-ray treatment.

Do yourself a favor and buy this Blu-ray collection of Stargate: Atlantis. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!

P.S. I have reviewed other items such as the Qmx Stargate coasters and Stargate mirror. Take a look at those, they are interesting items.",1316304000,,2585,4.644736842105263

4487395,5,B004WJT5H4,"Many people were concerned about the quality of the discs and how they played on the previous DVD set.  In this blu-ray set,  I have watched most of the episodes, (and fast forwarded at various speeds on a few episodes) and I wanted to point out that the audio and video are excellent.

While watching the episodes, I realized that the storyline arcs move forward surprisingly fast, including the episodes that deal with the Wraith, the Genii people, the Replicators, and the Ancients.  Because the plots moved so fast, if you missed or forgot what happened on a few episodes, you may get confused.  I believe this is what happened at the end of the third season and part of the reason why I started to lose interest in the TV show; it really started to get confusing.  The stories and plots are so tightly written and edited that I had to watch a few episodes again to fully understand and appreciate where the plots were going.  Having watched most of the episodes again, I have a new-found appreciation of this show.  At first I thought most of the good episodes were in the first three seasons, but seasons four and five contain many excellent episodes as well.

In regard to the special effects, the three part arc when the Wraith attack Atlantis has excellent sound effects and quite spectacular images, including fireworks-like explosions over the shield of the city-spaceship.  (Actually, any of the battle or war scenes really stand out, like the constant buzzing sound of the Wraith war drones or the popping of the artillery.) Most of the special effects are pretty good in my estimation.

Another reviewer wrote about picture issues with the Vegas episode on the last disc.  I checked my disc and watched that specific episode and everything was fine.  Again, the sound and picture are excellent.

The total packaging is well done.  It comes in three separate and sturdy blu-ray plastic cases, which fit into a hard cardboard case.  Discs stay firmly in their places and are easy to take out.  There are twenty discs which all played great and all one hundred episodes were fine and in order.

The only audio option is English 5.1dts-hd and the only subtitle option is English for the deaf and hard of hearing.

There are an amazingly high number of commentaries for many episodes which I have not listened to.

Watching Stargate Atlantis again has opened my eyes to the fact that some of these stories are incredibly well-written and acted.  I highly recommend this blu-ray set.",1312761600,34,2491,4.746511627906977

It is a fantastic Sci-Fi TV show which, obviously, has minor issues including cheap visual effects. But the acting and script make up for it! I own every season on dvd and was weary about spending the money for the upgrade... I was very pleased with the results. The picture quality has been vamped up a lot! Now, it won't look as good as say Avatar on bluray, but it was filmed in 720p and with the work they did on the picture and sound quality, it does stand out! This box set includes all 100 Stargate Atlantis episodes, the good and the crappy stories all packed into one set. I also was uncertain if the box that held the disks was any good. Because in the past Stargate box sets had issues with crappy packaging and damaging discs. Be assured they did much better this time and the box holds 3 (thick but regular and solid) bluray cases. The first case holds season 1 and 2. The second seasons 3 and 4. And the last thinner one holds season 5.

I highly recommend this set... and support stargate to return. (And not in another crappy Stargate Universe form! That was just terrible.)",1311811200,11,1195,4.382882882882883
4487401,5,B004WJT5H4,"First of all, the packaging for the blu-ray set is simple.  A small cardboard case with two thick plastic cases containing the first four seasons, and a thinner, four disc case for season five.

After viewing a few of the episodes, I can honestly say the video quality is superb. The colors are bright and vivid and SGA hasn't ever looked this good.  I had bought the ""Fan's Choice"" blu-ray with three episodes, and it's safe to say the rest of the series has been transferred to high-def just as well.

The audio is to be expected, 5.1 DTS and I haven't noticed anything I could complain about.

There are too many special features to list, but there are more than pretty much any other boxset I've owned.  Quite frankly it will take me months to listen to all the audio commentaries and featurettes, deleted scenes, and interviews.  However, I believe they are all the same ones included in the DVD release so if you plan on upgrading to the blu-ray from the DVD set, you're paying for the higher resolution episodes, that's it.

Just a note, the special features are all in standard definition, so keep that in mind.  Personally, I'm fine with that since all I care about are the actual episodes being in HD, but it's still something worth mentioning.

Highly recommended, the price alone is worth seeing SGA in such excellent quality and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase the set if you're even thinking about it.",1311638400,156,1415,4.624
