4500111,4,B004YJZ5PI,"I saw that this was an 'After Dark Film',After Dark being the Company that brought us the 8 Films To Die For/Horror Fest series that came out once a year starting in 2006.

That was enough to pique my interest but I must say this was a very well made ,well cast and fast paced thriller that left no room for boredom.
Jim Caviezel,James Frain and Harold Perrineau were outstanding in there roles ,Jim Caviezel as the ex con on vacation with his family who just so happens to be at the wrong place wrong time and Frain and Perrineau as two of the thugs that want to make his life hell On earth.
This isn't a Horror film as After Dark Films usually are but it does boast some horrifying moments and it definitely thrills.

It was only an hour and 27 minutes but not a minute was wasted and you actually get enough Character Build up to care.
This is basically a survival movie with some aspects of revenge the fact that it's set in a swamp with snakes and gators is a plus. I would watch it again in a second.",1340496000,12,1006,4.180412371134021
4500112,3,B004YJZ5PI,"I should have waited for it to be on cable, lets put it that way. It was not great but not bad either. Nothing  new or original at all. Same old story.  Father messed up before,  is trying to be a good guy now.  There is action but the kind of action that has been seen and done so many times before.  A Supposed to be twist, but can't pull that one off.  So there  it is. Too bad I can't write more about it.  Not alot of meat to it. I love action movies  and  I watch alot of movies, this one I have to say I am Not  impressed with. Again, not bad but not great by any stretch.",1339545600,,579,3.7024793388429753
4500113,4,B004YJZ5PI,I love Jim Caviezel in Person of Interest! So I had to see this movie after watching the trailer and the 3 reviews that were posted gave it a great rating. And they were right on with there reviews. This movie is well done and will keep you entertained. Lots of great action and should get your adrenaline going. I highly recommend this one and well worth the rental cost.,1338163200,12,372,4.328571428571428
4500114,4,B004YJZ5PI,"The action starts right off and is tight and tense throughout. The acting is actually quite impressive, particularly for a movie of this sort. Though they're not multi-layered, the ""good guys"" aren't necessarily cardboard cutouts and one sympathizes with their plight. Although the ""bad guys"" could have easily been written as archetypes and, at moments, seem to be in danger of falling into cartoon bad guy land, the actors, script writer, and director overall manage to depict bad guys who one can be interested in observing as the characters think through their next moves and evolve throughout the movie. Overall, the movie depicts not a wholly unbelievable premise and turn of events; which is good as that helped me to be even more engrossed in the film.

I subtracted one star from the rating because there are a few moments where one finds themselves thinking, ""Uh, why would you do that?!"" I'll give you one example that doesn't give any crucial points away in the movie (but if you don't like learning anything about what occurs in a movie before watching it, skip to the next paragraph): The father smashes his own cell phone on a deserted stretch of highway. Huh?

Anyhow, because of a few head-scratching moments like that, it gets 4 stars. But know that it held my attention throughout and I felt it an entertaining 2 hours of viewing. As an aside, there is a great deal of swearing and a bit of gore, most of it implied/happens off-camera in the early part of the movie. The last 30 minutes, though, do get a bit more graphic/bloody but nothing even close to torture-pornesque.",1337472000,,1592,4.7644927536231885
4500115,4,B004YJZ5PI,"Normally, I absolutely loathe the ""shaky"" camera technique and quick cut aways. But it definitely made this movie work and without it I think movie would of bombed. It was surprised how well it worked. I have a completely new respect for the filming method.",1337040000,12,257,4.733333333333333
4500116,5,B004YJZ5PI,"Extremely good movie for it's type. Don't want to say too much and spoil it.  A family unknowningly ends up transporting stolen money thru a roadblock and the crooks need to get it back.  What happens after is non-stop action.  What's really great is that the plot has no major flaws in it. No obvious ""That doesn't make sense..."" situations.  Nothing profound here, just the crooks rather violently try to get the money back.  It's entertaining, and you want to see how it turns out.  The criminals are ruthless.  The family while not necessarily endearing (obviously there is not a lot of room for character development), will have you rooting for them. In fact I found myself sympathizing with the father in his efforts to save his marraige and pull his family together given his sordid past.  The acting is solid.

I haven't rated a movie 5 stars before, but if you are just looking to be entertained, you're not wasting your money here (if this type of movie appeals to you). I have been sadly disappointed with some recent releases like ""Rampart"" and ""The Grey"", primarily because the ending was ambiguous and/or there were some serious flaws in the plot that were distracting.  This movie is of a different gendre of course, a heist gone bad; it brings to mind movies like ""The Town"" and ""Heat""; while a cut below these, it was very well done nevertheless.  The pacing was fast, with several surprises, and the action was realistic.",1336780800,29,1439,4.716

4500141,1,B004YJZ5PI,"Starts out great, and Jim Caviezel is an amazing actor that I love, but after the first half, this movie just becomes painful to watch.
The amount of stupid that takes place after the bank robbers lose their guns is just IDIOTIC. Spoiler: A cop is hit by the bank robbers in a car and the family is right by the cop, who just so happens to have a gun on his hip. They're standing right there. Get the gun before the car turns around and the movie is over... this happens twice by the way. Plenty of time to save your family from knife wielding robbers. And the car overheating... and the crash into the swamp... and the Nova never getting a dent after repeatedly bashing the Land Rover, and running over a cop... just really stupid.",1515369600,,732,4.311594202898551

4500144,2,B004YJZ5PI,"Good plot and storyline, but truly frustrating to watch. The dynamic between the father and son and between the bad guys was tiring to watch. The real killer for me was the seemingly unending amounts of rounds from the AK and the pump shotgun in the final shootout. And fifty gallon barrels won't stop rounds from an AK. :(",1513728000,,323,4.491525423728813

4500149,3,B004YJZ5PI,"Odd camerawork and cheap looking filming make for a distracting watch despite solid action and acting. Really, this looks like it was filmed with a $200 camera then ran through a filter that washed out all color and any semblance of a natural look. In addition shots are not framed well, disappointing and distracting. Odd.",1505260800,,323,4.890909090909091
4500150,3,B004YJZ5PI,"Acting was so so by some of the performers such as the wife and kid.  The main actor who played the father was pretty good.  The story is decent, but it was frustrating to watch some of the arguments that were quite stupid.  The story is about a guy who made a mistake during his time working in the real estate market in which he did an illegal transaction that cost him some time in jail.  He's now out on parole realizing his mistake and wants to spend time with his wife and two sons to help bring his family together again.  However, his wife and older son has no respect for the father/husband.  The father kind of forced the family to take a camping trip to share moments together even though the wife and older son had no interest in the trip.  While driving to a camp site, they encountered a group of armor truck robbers who stole $4 million and needs to pass the police barricade by hiding the money in their camping bags that are hanging on top of their car without their knowledge.  In the meantime the robbers who are also killers drive through the barricade only to want their money back after everyone passes the barricade.  This is where all the chases take place whether by car or by feet, and where there are plenty of misunderstandings.  The annoying thing is the wife and older son argue about some of the stupidest things and the kid is spoiled with no manners.  The story is not boring, but sometimes you just want to kick one of the actors to say that was stupid.",1505174400,,1487,4.332129963898917

A police phone call could end this story perfectly when she found the money, instead she threw a fking tantrum like an idiot and ran away. Guys, there are women like her in real life, no brain, spoiled and full of stupidity, watch out. I guess this is all this movie teaches.",1501200000,,445,4.373493975903615

4500155,2,B004YJZ5PI,"The actors/actresses did a good job with what they had to work.  Unfortunately, the script was so full of holes that it was impossible to see any substance anywhere.  This one required a tremendous suspension of disbelief.  I laughed out loud when Elisabeth Rohm (supposedly an average person) picks up a fully automatic weapon and, not only does she know how to operate it, she is reasonably accurate with it.  Plus, it is a magic weapon that never runs out of ammunition.  That's only one example.  There were so many contradictions that they number too many to document and it would be unfair to reveal any of this imaginary plot.",1499299200,6,633,4.709090909090909

4500160,2,B004YJZ5PI,"Sorry but with the reviews I thought this was an action movie. If you call cut scene to the engine starting after the criminals pull over at road block action, then this movie is for you. Could not watch it because of the camera switching back and forth and very shaky. Acting didn't seem to be to bad. I just do not see were these reviews are getting action movie. At the beginning they place plastic explosive on armored car, the only action is watching someone toggle the switch no explosion . I thought I might of been a little rough so watch the chase scene. They topped out at 80 mph then the criminals see a cop and slow down. The guy they were chasing got pulled over. I think he ended up with an 80 mph ticket, unless they were in Wyoming were the speed limit is 80. They actually show the speedometer (maybe its suppose to be a comedy) hahahahahaha.... I had to turn it back off. If you are an action fan this will disappoint. hahaahahaha.....80 MPH chase scene...BAHAAHAHAHAHA.....",1498694400,,992,4.426229508196721

4500172,4,B004YJZ5PI,"This is a very exciting, action-packed, and suspenseful movie. A family is terrorized by some criminals as they try to do some family bonding. But this is not your typical happy-go-lucky family. They do have issues which includes using a constant barrage of profanity. To me this brings the movie down because it is unnecessary. But the action is gripping with tense moments between the family and the bank robbers as they try to out-maneuver each other. Some of the scenes are quite graphic in nature but the musical score keeps your juices flowing as you witness a good action drama. I always liked Jim Caviezel as an actor. Even though this is not his best role, he handles himself well. The dialogue and relationships between the characters is very good with terror written on the faces of the family that is believable throughout the movie. Without giving too much away, the ending is predictable for this type of movie but the ride along the way is exciting, action-packed, and suspenseful. I definitely recommend this movie.",1497139200,,1031,4.863636363636363

4500175,4,B004YJZ5PI,"I've watched similar films to this, but one defining characteristic of this one is that it kept my attention throughout. This is good as a moviegoer because if you lose one's attention whether that be at school, work, and or at a movie theater you will gain nothing from the engagement. Now, I didn't enjoy how gruesome this film's action sequences were, but the premise I could definitely see playing out in real life and as a human this really scares me. Overall, I think if you don't mind bloody action sequences that you'll somewhat like this film.",1496534400,,552,4.642857142857143

4500255,4,B004YJZ5PI,"After a successful bank heist, four criminals are trapped in a rest stop. Surrounded by road blocks, all they can do is stash the loot, and what better place than on top of a family mini-van, on it's way to a camping trip. With the police behind them, the race is on to get their money, before the family discovers what's on top of their car. Jim Caviezel stars, and while he will always be remembered for his role in The Passion, he is actually a pretty successful actor. He's terrific in his hit TV show, Person of Interest, and has done a ton of independent films like this one. As the father, trying to escape a dark past, Caviezel is amazing as the simple father, turned action star, once his family is threatened. Also of note is his older son, played by Sterling Knight. Knight is a blond haired, blue eyed, Disney star known best for his role in 17 Again. To see this tween idol playing a angst filled teen, smoking pot, dropping F bombs, and shooting shot guns, really did give me quite a good laugh. Transit is your typical action chase film, with two exceptions, one, a very interesting back story, and two a top star, who seems to enjoy staying below the grid in Hollywood. It's not much different from all the other Action films you've seen, but it has it's moments, and it was definitely fun to watch.",1438473600,,1315,4.39344262295082

Given the social-engineering aspect if how these movies and video games which contribute to normalizing sociopathic behavior for the 'very rare unstable few' in society who end up mass murdering, it's sadly no wonder that since the 1960's America has experienced a new class of 'not for profit mass murders' perpetrated by a rare and unstable young men who feel so comfortable engaging in such horrible acts.

EVERY time they made a choice, EVERY time they took an action, it was the wrong one.  People that stupid couldn't have lived to adulthood.  It got really tiresome.  Do you ever find yourself urging a character to do this, or don't do that, or look out behind you?  Of course they don't always do what you say.  But these people NEVER do.  Too stupid to watch.

4500288,5,B004YJZ5PI,"I mostly agree with Cheryl's good, brief review (for Amazon-Canada) of ""Transit: This Is Not a Perfect Getaway"" (V.V.S. Films 1682 being the DVD edition viewed). However, I would contest her rating (of only 3 stars). This action and road film of crime and abduction is OUTSTANDING! And I am not even a big fan of the action film category, at that. The plot turns upon a vacationing family, among whose auto's car-top baggage, unbeknownst to them, some murderous thieves ""plant"" their loot from an armoured car which they robbed and who then spend the remainder of the movie, foremost among other things, attempting to recover their stash.

James Frain, especially, and Jim Caviezel are among my favourite actors and they cover themselves in glory in this fast-moving film. I never expected Frain, one of the ruthlessly brutal criminals in this movie, to appear in such a role, having seen him in numerous films in artier genres (as well, of course, as in""The Tudors"" televised series). His character is relentless focussed on his family's welfare and his acting, (very appropriately, too) relentlessly convincing. Caviezel not only is persuasive as one very tough, determined, and resourceful father, but he succeeds in characterising the man's total commitment to protecting his nearly estranged wife and their two sons with a love of burning intensity.

No additional indications of details of the story-line from me, either, Cheryl! You are right that such a plot-driven film needs that element of surprise, maybe this one even more of that than usual. ""Transit"" is more intelligently conceived, too, than many cinematic works of its type, adding to the pleasures that it provides, with no loss in other interest and thrills that this motion picture has abundantly to offer.

The setting is in Louisiana, much of it in bayou swamplands. The provides some very interesting scenery, not to mention  some alligators and a snake who have their own bit roles to play in the film. The setting adds immensely to the viewer's fun watching this film.",1419120000,,2044,5.038461538461538

I look at the B&W movies from the 1950's and they did have a lot of violence and intrigue too, but we do have to consider what we are teaching the kids now.",1357603200,,489,3.989795918367347
4500315,4,B004YJZ5PI,This movie is part of Cinemax's transition to an all action and thriller network. It is definitely a late night type movie but I love movies like this. The story is full of holes but who cares? The action never stops and all the actors are familiar faces. Highly recommended if you enjoy the late night thriller type of movie.,1351987200,14,326,4.45

4500317,5,B004YJZ5PI,"Transit succeeds where very little other thrillers do- this one keeps the pace intact for the entire time without even *one* second of boredom.  If you blink you'll miss a lot.  It's about four robbers that come up with this plan to put a bag of stolen money with this family headed for a vacation.  Apparently the reason behind this is, so the police don't suspect anything when the criminals are pulled over and have their vehicle searched.  The police can't arrest four guilty-looking people based solely on looking guilty *especially* if there's no bag of stolen money in their possession, right?

Well the truth is, it seems suspicious that the cops wouldn't notice that these robbers looked familiar and would therefore arrest them on the spot, so we'll assume it was a clueless cop that pulled them over and searched their vehicle.  Then again, if the robbery was recent and this was the first time they've committed a crime, the cops wouldn't yet have an idea what the suspects look like.  With this in mind, this particular plothole might not exist and is totally forgivable.

With all the commotion going on between the bad guys and the family switching back and forth from one segment to another at lightning speed, it took several minutes to figure out who was actually who.  Perhaps a poor way of introducing the characters, but not terrible since all the pieces were soon to fall into place.

Anyway, once the robbers are free to roam the streets, they search for the family that unwillingly has their money in their possession (mixed in with the other camping trip bags) and from here... all you-know-what breaks loose!  It's then a game of survival as the family argues, yells, runs, drives, hides, swims, uses any and all weapons they can find such as guns and knives, all in an attempt to get rid of these feisty criminals that always seem to be right behind them.  PURE action-packed, and the movie doesn't disappoint.

Terrific acting all around, great storytelling that's easy to understand (after the first 10 minutes) and a fantastic movie overall.",1350604800,,2071,4.8

4500321,4,B004YJZ5PI,"Absolutely enjoyed this movie to the full. Transit is exactly like the type of movies i like, which is a thriller with some action.
Jim Caveizel plays a dad who is trying to reconnect with his family by taking them camping, unfortunately for them they get caught in a cat and mouse chase with a gruesome gang of 4 who just robbed an armored truck and used the family to sneak the money though a check point.

the film is what you would expect from a chase thriller, with 4 very skilled badies pursuing the normal suburban family through the road, with thrills, some twists and turns, and solid action.
the cast really makes the movie stronger, with the actors playing their parts to perfection. Jim Caveizel was amazing as the Dad who is trying to pull his family out of this trouble.
his wife played by Elizabeth Rohm was also very good, and the bad guys were also well acted in this film, lead by James Frain who has that evil look.

the setting of the film which mostly takes place on the road and in swamps surrounding the road added much to the film, and the actions was very solid with some good production values. the movie never felt like a low budget or a B-movie to me.

in short, one of the better thrillers out there, and im quite surprised how this movie fell below the radar, very enjoyable and entertaining.
I would recommend this highly, and also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Contract/dp/B0019FWIEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Contract</a>&nbsp;which is very similar to this. enjoy",1345766400,2,1560,4.9465648854961835

Genre: 8 Movie: 6

What's it about?
The camping trip was meant to reunite the Sidwell family. When they are hunted and terrorized by violent bank robbers, their very survival will depend on working together.

What did I think?
I threw this in my player not expecting much.  Then my alarm went off and I woke up to an intense thriller with all the fat trimmed off.  Sometimes you want a simple, straightforward approach to a film with no complications or unecessary twists.  When you're in that mood...put this one in your player.",1345593600,2,649,4.741071428571429

4500324,4,B004YJZ5PI,"""Seconds Apart"" director Antonio Negret generates some genuine adrenaline-fueled thrills, chills, and spills in his second feature length release. The rural crime thriller ""Transit"" qualifies as an exciting road picture about four murderous thieves who tangle with an innocent family in backwater Louisiana over a fortune in stolen loot. The only shortcoming of this above-average but formulaic melodrama is its lackluster ending that deprives the protagonist of any reward for his heroic deeds. Fortunately, the cast is convincing, particularly Jim Caviezel as the devastated dad and James Frain as the desperate villain. The ignorant authorities are clueless about what is happening between the heroes and the villains. Ironically, the lawmen  only complicate matters and imperil our hero and his family. Frain looks particularly degenerate as the sleazy gang leader, while Harold Perrineau registers intensely as a trigger-happy henchman. ""According to Greta"" scenarist Michael Gilvary has cross-stitched the plots from the Dana Andrews' epic ""Hot Rods to Hell"" and the Audrey Hepburn nail-biter ""Wait Until Dark."" In `Hot Rods to Hell,"" rebellious teens terrorize a family on a deserted stretch of highway. In ""Wait Until Dark,"" a deadly drug dealer stashes his narcotics in the blind heroine's luggage for a transoceanic flight and the villains invade her New York apartment.

In ""Transit,"" a quartet of reckless armored car robbers need to get past a police roadblock. They replace the camping gear strapped down to the top of the Sidwell family SUV with their ill-gotten gains. Initially, our heroes have no clue about the dastards after them. Marek (James Frain of ""Titus""), Arielle (Diora Baird of ""Wedding Crashers""), Losada (Harold Perrineaus of ""The Matrix Revolutions""), and Evers (Ryan Donowho of ""Broken Flowers"") have fooled themselves into believing that they can retrieve their loot from the unsuspecting family before they realize that they've  been used as a mule. Naturally, nothing goes right for either side and those are the best dramatic moments. The conflict emerges from the situation. Our hero Nate (Jim Caviezel of ""Outlander"") has just been paroled from prison. He served time for real estate fraud. Now, Nate is struggling to get his wife Robyn (Elisabeth Rhm of ""Abduction"") and sons together for a vacation when they run afoul of the bad guys. Some of the action will take you by surprise. Neither Negret nor Gilvary make it easy for either the heroes or their adversaries. No sooner do the villains have the loot than they lose it. Not long after the hero appropriates the millions, he loses it in the swamp.
The black 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle that the villains drive assumes a character of its own and the long shots of it hauling down the highway look as cool as the spinning tire shots. Negret handles the chase sequences with aplomb. The car crash involving the Sheriff Deputy's Crown Victoria is awesome. ""Transit"" never wears out its welcome.",1343347200,6,2981,5.2322175732217575
4500325,3,B004YJZ5PI,"Four criminals on the run must pass without suspicion through the road blockade set up to catch them. They have just robbed an armored money truck, and have four million dollars in a bag with them. Now one of them thinks of a brilliant idea; let's hide the bag in someone else's car, someone who does not look like a robber! All they have to do is follow the car, pass through the blockade and retrieve the bag later.

James Caviezel plays Nate, on a family vacation with his wife Robin (Elisabeth Rhm) and two sons, among whose camping gear a bag full of money is concealed. James Frain plays Marek, leader of the criminals, whose ""perfect"" plan, as you expect, goes awry when Nate realizes someone is chasing his car.

The story of the low-budget actioner unfolds like a good, old-fashioned B movie, with some nice stunts including car chases and shoot-outs, and lots of illogical motives on the part of the hunters and the hunted. If you think the gang's decision to hide the bag is stupid enough (yes, it is), there are more silly moments to come in the film's running time. You might ask yourself: why walking into the swamps? Why driving in such a conspicuous way? Why?

But somehow I didn't hate the film simply because I didn't care all these silly details. Actually, I enjoyed them as part of the action thriller that is silly, but still enjoyable in its own way.",1343174400,,1372,4.524193548387097

8448465,5,B004YJZ5PI,"I give this action film 5 stars for an Amazon action film.  It was well done and for the most part, very believable.  I especially love a strong female lead character.  (May be a spoiler ahead, so stop reading if you don't want to know my impression of the end)  This one has a lot of action leading up to the happy ending.  The only part of the movie that wasn't really believable was the continuous driving along the long stretch of the back road without another single car traveling along that road.  But I wasn't bothered by that because the movie kept moving with minimal if any idle time.  I thought the movie flowed well too and I'd recommend it if you're looking for an action drama film that is just a pretty good movie with no love scenes or sex scenes.",1529280000,,763,4.293706293706293
