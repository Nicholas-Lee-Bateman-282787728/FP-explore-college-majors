4311084,4,B004ASOF2M,"Young vampires with alternative attitudes make this very contemporary fang flick stand out from an overdone genre--not that Let the Right One In (2008) or the remake Let Me In (2010) weren't unique, repeated delights.  There is an outlandishly perky a la Anime fashionista, an experienced techno-chic lesbian, a deep, depressed intellectual, and a teen, tomboy, grungy human newbie.

 The story gets interesting when the grungy newbie is transformed early in the movie and learns from her experienced peers' advice.  During the slow, vein-blaringly painful transformation we learn that all the standard vampire rules seem to apply.  1) Hair-styling and make-up are tough without being able to use a mirror; 2) beastly, insatiable hunger goes unremedied by food, so start an LA fad diet on blood; 3) there is a desperate need for SPF 5000 in daylight; 4) you gain super crazy bitch strength and you regenerate; 5) you can defy gravity better than Michael Jackson and fight like those chicks in The Craft (1996); 6) vampires exercise a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy; and 7) all vampires lead a swanky lifestyle.  Religion goes unaddressed throughout the movie and I don't know about garlic.  They never ate any Italians.

With her newfound vampiric elegance, our newbie is now a tomboy-turned-princess.  But because this isn't some gun and sword-filled installment of Blade (1998-2004) or Underworld (2003-2012), we need a plot device.  And in every non-action fang flick the problems all seem to stem from turning someone into a vampire who doesn't take it well.  It happened in Interview with a Vampire (1994), Near Dark (1987), Fright Night (1985-2011)...pretty much all of them.  And then, life goes to Hell for ALL vampires as if this was the first time that someone ever took poorly to being turned into a vampire and didn't devoutly follow the tenets of vampirism.  Go figure.  Not to rant and rave, but it's worth pointing out.  However, I actually enjoyed the movie a lot.

Anyway, our fully-turned newbie starts out feeling enamored by the power and lifestyle.  As she learns more she becomes hesitant and frightened by their method of sustenance and the consciouslessness that accompanies it.  Ultimately she becomes resistant to the vampire way along with the romantic fixation her maker holds for her and how that conflicts with her feelings for a human she met before she was turned.  Throw in a lot of clubbing and that's the plot in a nutshell.

During the turning/transformation, feeding scenes and the resistance phase at the end we get a lot of violence (including one particular scene for which I'll issue a ""violence against women"" warning).  The action is well done, along with generally all aspects of production.  However, the major flaw in this movie--at least the Netflix version I saw--was the poor English dubbing job.  Before I got used to it, I would have almost preferred to ""read"" this movie.  But once the story got started I thankfully forgot all about it.

Minus the inevitable outcome, this film depicts a fantasy of the young and beautiful, immortalized in a taboo shell, living with wealthy trappings like fancy cars and doing whatever they please.  There's also some not-so-in-your-face feminism that I could appreciate.  Evidently, guys who can't handle Vegas are like all guys to vampirism in general.  So no male vampire egos run rampant in this movie.

Older moviegoers will likely appreciate this movie less.  I certainly enjoyed it.  But I know that over ten years ago (we'll just say from age 15-22) I would have loved it.",1327190400,2,3567,5.00509337860781
4311085,3,B004ASOF2M,"As the other reviewers have noted, there isn't much new here but it's done with such flare, fans of the genre should still have a great time with it.

Here's the scoop. Lena's a punk. No father and a mother that doesn't seem to care much. She's been in trouble with the law and spends her time as a pick-pocket and petty thief. She catches the eye of both a detective as well as the leader of a three pack of female vampires. The head vamp bites and turns her because she reminds her of her one great love from a couple of centuries prior. Lena is now running the gamut between digging it and not. The parties are cool but the bloodletting isn't. And she's starting to fall for the detective, and he for her. How will it all play out?

This is a vampire flick of the newer vein. These are hipper vamps with a taste for fast cars, discos and cocaine. Live by night and sleep by day. Kill when you need to and shop till you drop. This has more in common with ""Blade"" than with ""Dracula."" The story is solid. Not new, but it moves logically. A few points were manipulated a bit too hard but I didn't gag on it. It's directed with a lot of pizzazz which is why it's so worthwhile to watch. In the hands of a lesser director this would have been a real yawn-fest. The vamps are a varied lot. The leader looks a bit like Maria Bello. One looks like Pippy Longstocking robbed Cyndi Lauper's closet and the third is just plain gorgeous. Lena goes from having an interesting face as a punk to being quite fetching as she dolls up. They are quite the crew to watch.

This is more three and a half stars as opposed to the three I gave it. It's a good entry into the genre and it's set my radar to what the director, Dennis Gansel, will do next.",1325462400,3,1733,4.136498516320475
4311086,4,B004ASOF2M,"4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece

Forget the cheesy poster!

Maybe the best Vampire movie you've never seen. This little German gem is well acted, scripted, directed, & edited. The English dubbing is truly superior!

A young girl gets inducted to a family of female Vampires involuntarily, because the head Vampire see's in her, the lost love of her life.

The joys, the sorrow, the tragedy of being immortal, is so fleshed out in this film it is truly touching. You care about the main characters. A stake in the heart.

Attractive female vamps spending the whole movie lounging, shopping, clubbing and playing with their expensive toys (e.g. cars).

Negatives:
Attractive female vamps spending the whole movie lounging, shopping, clubbing and playing with their expensive toys (e.g. cars). That's the whole movie. No creative novel take on all the other vampire movies other than subbing females for males. The usual little bit of red makeup on the necks of a couple of poor chaps and on the lips of our vamps was the main means to identify the movie as having something to do with vampires. Just enough for the viewer's tastes (haha). Then add a scene or two of sunshine as shown by a few seconds of cheap CGI burning and you have the total stereotypic vampire effects movie.
Acting was robotically artificial and storyline was same old vamps partying at night and dying during the day. One of the four vamps survives because her mother vamp dies before her thus she can resume her human nature even though the whole sequence was highly contrived and not very believable. Since she has returned to her human form she can now love the cop who was chasing her. Trite.",1319587200,4,1157,4.814070351758794

These are great German actors that do a super job!! Nina Hoss, the leader, is very well known in Europe and has made good movies. She is the romantic in the group. Karoline Herfurth is very popular in Germany. I have seen her in some U.S. movies, but not any lead roles. I really liked Jennifer Ulrich's moody depressed character. Her costumes are beautiful. Even though she isn't the lead, she is very beautiful! Anna Fischer adds to the fun factors since she is rarely serious & is the ""real"" party girl.although they all party. She just seems to have the most fun.  Max Riemelt is a handsome guy and sometimes, I wish I could have seen more of his character and maybe some more romance with he character ""Lena"".The sound track is awesome.

4311093,5,B004ASOF2M,"Release Options.
DVD: If you purchase the Region 2 disc (currently the least expensive format), you'll get an abundance of extras (bonus/special features) on the disc. Audio is offered in dubbed English, but I suggest not watching the movie unless you can accept the English subtitles option.
Blu-ray release (1080p, MPEG-4 AVC) has *no English subtitles*, so understand German if you buy it.

The quartet of German actresses provide at least 4 reasons to watch We Are the Night:

1. Karoline Herfurth was the perfect pick for the protagonist Lena. Herfurth is versatile, knows her craft, and has had a strong screen presence in Germany since the turn of the century. Her metamorphosis during the course of this vampire story is exceptional, a highlight of the film. She's worked with the film's director Dennis Gansel previously, as a teen in Mdchen Mdchen! (Girl on Top). Herfurth rules!

2. Nina Hoss, the eldest of the four (both the actress and her character Louise, who is hundreds of years old) was a fine pick as the matriarch. Apparently she was invited for the role about a decade earlier, but told writer/director Dennis Gansel, ""the script doesn't seem finished yet."" Other than newcomer Lena, Louise is probably the most pragmatic of the bunch, although the centuries have made her ruthless.

3. The lovely Jennifer Ulrich plays Charlotte, a brooding vampire always with a book in one hand and a cigarette holder in the other. The intellectual, existential vampire of the quartet, she has become too depressing for the tastes of leader Louise. Ulrich has rapport with Herfurth from a film early in their careers (Big Girls Don't Cry), and like Herfurth had previously worked with director Dennis Gansel. In one scene, Ulrich's character Charlotte was CGI'd into Fritz Lang's 1922&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Mabuse/dp/B00EQ27RNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Mabuse</a>, which is more difficult a feat than it sounds.

4. Actress/singer Anna Fischer is cute as heck, but she chews the scenery like mad. Still, it would not have been the same without Nora, who is sugar and spice and everything you want to avoid if you value your life.

Sure, there's plenty of typical vampire fare in this tale, but considering how many godawful vampire films are out there, We Are The Night is in a superior league with very few others, based on its sharp personality. One gripe I have with the genre is the usual lack of context provided re: the extent of a vampire presence in the fictional world presented. We Are The Night defies this norm explicitly when Louise informs Lena there are ""40 women in Europe, 100 worldwide."" What about male vampires? Watch to find out!

One reason this is 5 stars instead of 4 is on account of the extras. The deleted scenes show how the movie would have offered a slightly different tone to the final cut had they been included. Additionally, two alternative endings are on the disc, so you can ""pick your own adventure"" to please yourself. The cast & crew interviews are worth watching. Dennis Gansel made some noteworthy comments about the shallow lifestyle Louise and Nora had fallen into, and how it relates to our real world.",1464480000,,3216,5.056603773584905

4311110,5,B004ASOF2M,"When I first watched this movie it was because I had just gotten Net Flix and this was a free video on instant play. It had vampires on the cover (a different cover than the new edition cover shown) and I thought it may be enjoyable.

At the start of the movie I wasn't sold because of the long music opening with pictures of the girls from all the eras they lived in, but when the actual acting started I was take aback. I thought because I didn't know the actors names it was Indie, but it turned out to be German and dubbed.

The idea that vampires were all only strong women who could party, shop, and have sex for the rest of time without rules or men baring down on them was interesting. Still, I thought it need some romance and that was when the cop and the lead started.

By the end of the movies I was crying tears of fear and happiness. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, which is hard to do because I write paranormal for a living and usually see everything coming. I fell in love with it and I watch it all the time, it is a movie I use when I need to fight off writer's block.

I would suggest it to anyone and if I knew them personally I might kidnap them and force them to watch it with me (which I'v done to family and my boyfriend already).",1372550400,2,1273,3.980392156862745

(The only interesting part of this film was geographical: The vamps live in a 5 Star (formerly West Berlin) Hotel, and the police kid lives in a (formerly East Berlin) apartment house.  West European architects rebuilt with beautiful classic Renaissance style in West Berlin, while the Soviets built ugly utilitarian peoples dwellings in East Berlin.  The ugliness of Soviet East Berlin still stands today.)

4311120,4,B004ASOF2M,"It's been awhile since I've watched a film with subtitles. The last one was the brilliant Swedish horror flick Let the Right One In.  Wir Sind Die Nacht (We Are the Night) is equally enjoyable, but of a much different style and tone.

The movie opens with pictures of Berlin through the ages, and haunting, operatic music, beginning with modern day Berlin and moving backwards in time, to the Fall of the Berlin War, the Second World War and further into the past.  The same women appear in photos throughout these historical eras. One of them can be seen in an oil painting, giving us an idea how old this lady is.  An intriguing voice-over asks: ""If you knew that there is only one person in the whole world who is able to make you happy. And he is the right one for you, what would you sacrifice to find him? How many centuries would you spend searching for him? And if you finally found him, would you ever let him go again?...""

Vampire boss Louise (Nina Hoss), her second in command Charlotte (Jennifer Ulrich) and the younger, fun-loving Nora (Anne Fischer) jump from a plane over Berlin having killed the passengers and crew.  The next scene introduces us to the troubled Lena (Karoline Herfurth) who immediately reminded me of Lisbeth Salander from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She picks the wrong guy to steal from, and ends up being pursued, in a highly enjoyable and exciting chase through the city by a cop, Tom (Max Riemelt - FYI, he's lovely ladies).  You have to laugh at a cop who sees the funny side of being punched in the face and kicked in the groin by the thief he's chasing.

Lena has the bad luck to show up in Louise's vampire nightclub one night.  She reminds Louise of her dead maker and the woman she loved, and Louise wastes no time in making her into a vampire. Max tracks Lena down but she has already been turned and is under the scrutiny of the deranged Louise.  We know this love triangle isn't going to end well.

We Are The Night is a slick and stylish, lightweight movie.  In this universe, there are no male vampires.  Wondering why? You'll have to watch the film to find out!  Louise and co spend their time dancing, eating, having sex and driving fast cars.  They live a life of luxury and decadence and feed without remorse, the latter of which Lena struggles with.  The most interesting vampire for me was Charlotte who looks like she stepped out of the 1920s.  We discover she was an actress in the silent film era when Louise took a shine to her and promptly removed her from her human life where she was married and had a child.  Once we learn this, Charlotte's cold and seemingly detached personality makes a lot more sense.
These vampires are traditional in nature: they cast no reflection, can't come out during the day and they kill humans.  The film loses its way about halfway through but the action picks up again towards the end.  If you're looking for high drama and a deep and meaningful story, this film isn't going to provide that for you.  On the other hand, if you're after some harmless entertainment with nice acting and a handsome human police officer who's in love with a vampire (I'll mention him again, Max Riemelt :) ), give this a watch.

I had never heard of any of these great actors before, and We Are the Night made me want to watch more European films.  And of course being the sucker for paranormal romance that I am, I was hoping Lena and Tom would find a way to be together.",1337299200,,3453,4.446031746031746

I was finally bored enough to give it a try and found it to be a really good vampire flick. The story line was refreshingly original for the genre and it was well acted.  The dubbing was well done which is, for me, a must on any non-english film.",1332547200,,410,4.177215189873418
4311122,2,B004ASOF2M,"I watched this hoping for a decent vampire movie, it is not.

It's a slow movie that explores a world where the only vamps are female and typically lesbians and/or ravers. Not that I dislike lesbians or ravers, but its just touches on the clichs and doesn't really deliver. If you watch it and it bores you too, leave a lack luster review and save the next poor viewer from having their evening sucked away. (That bad pun is better than the movie!)",1331337600,2,448,4.397590361445783
4311123,3,B004ASOF2M,"Would have given it 5 stars if the channels weren't mapped incorrectly in the German soundtrack. Had to watch it in stereo because hearing the center channel dialogue coming from the front right channel in 5.1 mode was just too annoying. Will be ripping the disc, demuxing the audio, correcting the channels, remuxing, then burning a corrected copy. The English dub is mapped correctly.. but who wants to listen to that crap?

This is the second time I have seen this happen on a movie. The other was R-Point.",1330560000,,509,4.719101123595506
4311124,4,B004ASOF2M,"Found this rough gem on Amazon Prime - A contemporary vampire story, interesting characters, well-photographed, stylish with English dubbing as bad as an Italian western.  I would have preferred to watch this in the original German with subtitles -- the amateurish dubbing takes some of the allure out of this film.  I put it just above the Underworld series (which isn't saying all that much), but I did enjoy it and would watch a sequel if they make one.  Your mileage may very.",1329609600,,480,4.759036144578313
4311125,1,B004ASOF2M,"I just attempted to view this piece of utter garbage based on two, nearly five star, reviews. My question is who is writing these reviews? Because if it is not the people who made this waste of time and energy than it has to be people from another planet. The acting is something that cannot even be rated as acting; it is sooo bad. The cinematography is non-existent. I am now a firm believer in conspiracy theories. Because for more than one person to say this is anything but cinematic vomit, has to be some kind of plot. Give your two dollars to a homeless person than sit at your desk and rub your eyes real hard, tilt your head back and look at the stars your eyes make. There is more thematic elements of story in that action than there is in this boondoggle. Pass,pass,pass, pass.",1329350400,4,788,4.36734693877551

4311127,4,B004ASOF2M,"This movie is a really nice change of pace from the seemingly unending stream of same-old, same-old vampire movies. We Are the Night examines the costs of immortality, but it's not a whoa-is-me-I'm-a-monster story, instead it's a look at what it means to live forever in a world where everything that matters is ephemeral.",1328832000,3,322,4.981481481481482

8420804,5,B004ASOF2M,Few missed things....mostly Louise and her obsession with finding Lena. Would a flashback have killed them? I believe Lena was suppose to be a reincarnation.

8420807,4,B004ASOF2M,"Good story, well done cinematically, tonally jumpy with the vamparic nature of the tale getting a little bit lost at times throughout in noteworthy film of the Genre.

This film starts with a well done backstory told in the front title cards that you can't really understand better until you have seen the film, but it's a nice touch and transition into the live action film. 'We Are the Night' also has quite a pronounced modern cinema vrit fast paced, (sometimes with an in your face 'Trainspotting' type approach to it's beat), action thriller style to it which does clashe abit with the tone of it's Vampire drama and character depth, as the film is at it's best & very good in a way, when it's vampiric lore and lens of the story, is given room to breathe.

All the performers were good, but i thought the material was generally elevated when the characters were more the embodiment of the vampire drama to the tale, & in that way the Blonde Vampire Louise was the tonal centre of the film throughout.

While some of the lore is abit threadbare & convenient ( like the story relating to other vampires in the world), 'We Are the Night' is still a note worthy vampire film that is a worthy addition to any cinematic binge relating to vampire cinema.

It is best watching with original German voice track and sub-titles.",1499126400,,1323,4.569620253164557

8420809,5,B004ASOF2M,Now I know saying that will give you high expectations and will probably cause you to enjoy the film a little less but if I didn't write that in the title I don't think many people will give this one a chance. Without giving anything away this film is about 4 beautiful women who do what they want when the want( when it's not day time) and it shows you how a vampire could own the night. It's bad ass. It's soul touching and will make you jealous. And it's in the most power language on the planet. There nothing bad to say about this film. It's even the only movie soundtrack I had to buy and it's in my car at all times. Just buy 3 copy's of this film. One to let friends borrow. One for you and one incase yours breaks. Trust me it's that good!,1493683200,,748,4.026845637583893
