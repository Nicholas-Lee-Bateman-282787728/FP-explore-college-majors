My autistic son knows the difference and it does make a difference to him. Please encourage your sellers to be very clear as to what you are purchasing, as most of these have done.",1372809600,,357,4.343283582089552
8737907,2,B000EVKTCO,"The only reason I went on Amazon was so find a special Disney Classics box set for
my 22 year old, severely autistic son.  I was so excited to see the picture in your ad.  This is a very rare box set and I knew my son would be so excited.

Boy, we're we disappointed.  The videos that came were 4 (not six, as in your picture) Disney CARTOON Classics (not Disney Classics, as shown in your picture).
It's the difference between ""Chip and Dale"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".

I called customer support.  She could see the problem and said it would be changed.  I decided to keep the videos we had.  the problem was NOT with the seller, but with Amazon.  Your picture does not match
your description.  Please change it.  It is very misleading.

  Sincerely,
