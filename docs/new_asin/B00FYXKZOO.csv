6040341,4,B00FYXKZOO,I enjoyed this movie and it is true in alot of ways no child of GOD'S should never accept a man or woman putting their hands on them as a form of love that is not how GOD has written your life to be. But be it man or woman who is being harmed in that way if they put CHRIST first in all that they do He will take you through it.,1403481600,,328,3.506849315068493
6040342,1,B00FYXKZOO,I didn't enjoy this movie. The acting was pretty bad and I wasted money on it. The title made me curious...but I could only take 15 minutes.,1400630400,,140,4.222222222222222

6040344,5,B00FYXKZOO,I chose this rating because the messesge of the sickness and ugliness of abuse is so easily noted. It provides hope to others who have been abused. I would recommend this movie for educational purposes and to individuals either suffering from abuse or who can support someone who is now or has been in an abusive situation.,1393804800,2,323,4.684210526315789
6040345,4,B00FYXKZOO,"I chose this rating because I appreciated the message and it showed the human element and the awesomeness of God.
I have recommended this movie to a diverse population, Christians, Muslims, the unchurched,  friends, co-workers, neighbors, and I recommended it as a lunch showing at work for some of the affinity groups.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.",1393804800,2,352,5.157894736842105
6040346,5,B00FYXKZOO,although it's a low budget independent film it has a great message and compelling actors. I really enjoyed the movie. Need more movies with these actors.,1393459200,3,153,4.923076923076923
6040347,2,B00FYXKZOO,"*****CONTAINS A SPECIFIC SCENE WHICH MAY BE A SPOILER. DOES NOT INCLUDE ENDING****

Diana (April Marcell) is a woman who wants to better herself. She is married to James (Aries Marvin Uzzle) a man who abuses her because he can. Diana compounds the problem by developing a relationship with the neighbor Langston (Ryan Harrington) named for the poet (see Black Nativity as this is becoming a fad). He is escaping a rougher life and has taken a shine to her shiner and took Diana home.

This is supposed to be a come to God film. That is fine, but the execution was ungodly.

The opening theme song stole some rifts from the James Bond theme, making you think this was going to be some kind of spy picture. The opening funeral scene, they over imposed the sound of the rain and I couldn't tell which was more annoying, it or the rant by the mistress (Terricita Copeland) who couldn't act.

April Marcell, who wrote, directed, and starred in this film had too much on the plate to be effective in any role. She is getting beat up during the film, but is far more bruised looking after the first punch to the face then the subsequent beatings. The punches looked fake, like something the WWF would do. There was an old fat Bruce Willis looking bald guy on the beach that takes on a gang by himself. Seriously April?

What had me in stitches was the scene where Diana is tied to a chair. After Big James has been using her as a punching bag with ease throughout the film, he now must chloroform her and duck tape her to a plastic lawn chair so he can punch her to the face. Diana is tough. She takes four solid hits to the face. I have personally seen grown men knocked out with half the bones in their face crushed with one such a blow. Diana, not only takes the blows, but uses her left hand to stop a punch and then knocks James to the floor with a right from a sitting position. She had a little bit of blood coming from the mouth, no doubt she accidentally bit her lip on one of the punches to the face.

You can watch it for the message or the camp.

6040383,3,B00FYXKZOO,"really enjoyed this film, although actors could have been better. nevertheless, the meaning of the film had been looked at in a way that reflects back to the way women who are being abused are being bullied from keeping quiet, because they either feel ashamed, scared or just don't know who to turn to. Hope this film can change some ones life or even someone who knows someone experiencing such difficulties in their life regarding the same scenario.",1418860800,,451,4.794871794871795

8619609,2,B00FYXKZOO,"I gave two stars for effort. Also because you can tell the story line had a message. Otherwise this was very hard to watch

8619614,1,B00FYXKZOO,I can't believe I sat thru this movie.  Very poor acting...oh my!,1505606400,,65,4.416666666666667
8619615,2,B00FYXKZOO,"For a purportedly Christian movie, there was too much sex and profanity.  The message is lost in poor script and acting and doesn't have clear direction.  The antagonist, James, is a very two-dimensional, unconvincing character.  Diana, the protagonist and the other characters make poor and often strange choices to navigate the way through her abuse.  We are not given enough context for these decisions, and there are no consequences so it just makes the movie annoying. Domestic abuse is a very serious problem and I think the movie honestly tries to deal with this but it was just poorly executed and there are a lot of other movies out there that would better serve this purpose.",1494288000,2,685,4.879310344827586
8619616,5,B00FYXKZOO,"First time ever giving a review without being asked.
This movie is the best movie I have ever seen. I read the other reviews and I don't understand the talk about the movie having profanity. This movie just displayed with real hard reality of abuse. Abuse isn't meant to be clean or sweet. This is really a movie about a calling on your life. Hats off to the writer and directors. This is a powerful and inspirational movie about giving up ones self to continue the fight to help other. Loved it and I cried.",1488585600,2,508,4.3578947368421055
8619617,1,B00FYXKZOO,I appreciate the effort in domestic abuse awareness but this is by far not one of my would see again nor one that I would recommend.,1486944000,,132,4.115384615384615
