6802364,5,B00PHD6DMO,"Peg+Cat follows the adventures of a girl and her best friend Cat as long he's by her side there is no problem to big or small that they can't solve together. Facing everyday problems they use math to save the day teaching young viewers addition, subtraction, counting, and problem solving skills.
There are also catchy songs to keep viewers attention and you might just find yourself singing along too!
On this DVD are the following 7 Rocking Episodes
The Big Gig Problem
The Mega Mall Problem
I do what I can the musical!
The Girl Group Problem
The Groovy Sixties Problem
The Magic Uke(Ukulele)
The Rocking Out Problem

Special Features on the DVD include
Pirate+Peaches Board Game
Four Fantastic flip books
Cat sock beanie instructions
Peg+Cat stick puppets

Mostly these are more activities then games

But I highly recommend the Cat sock beanie instructions feature, these instructions are super easy to follow (And also can be found on the pbskids.org website for a printable version of the instructions so you can take the instructions with you to the craft/fabric/sewing shop to get all you need to make this furry little friend)
I'm sure that your little one would love to have a plush toy of Cat but right now there are no toys of Peg+Cat in stores or online made by PBS but hopefully they will soon!
In the meantime this homemade plush toy of Cat will serve it's purpose of hours of cuddling time while watching lots of great Peg+Cat episodes with your little one besides becoming a treasured heirloom because you made it yourself! Also I recommend using a soft fleece material (like the kind used to make blankets to make it extra soft plus it comes in his purplely color and can be found in almost any fabric store,if you want it to have texture corduroy is also a good choice and comes in many colors)
I highly recommend the Peg+Cat TV series shown on PBS,this DVD and the other Peg+Cat DVDs available for purchase.
 On pbskids.org there are great free games for children to play online featuring Peg+Cat to keep them happy.
And you'll be happy knowing that pbskids.org is a super safe kid/family friendly website
This DVD also has closed captions in English option

8687913,5,B00PHD6DMO,"My son and my nephew love Peg + Cat... and I must admit she has grown on me too!  My son is only 3 and is counting to 30 very well.  He can count backwards from 20, knows his 2's & 10's and is counting objects very well thanks to some help from this show and others like it.  Just try not to sing the catchy little songs from this show... I dare you :-)",1467763200,,353,3.68
8687914,5,B00PHD6DMO,"The kiddo's love Peg +Cat. The are several episodes on this DVD. Each episode has a musical theme with different styles of music. My favorite is the Pentagirls... We play the video in the car DVD player and it restarts on its own (which is a plus). With the number of episodes included it is a fair value for less than 10 bucks.
