67586,5,078322740X,"A charming comedy played superbly by Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn.

Martin plays a decently successful architect and uses his talent to build a house for his high-school sweatheart.  He is rather romantically inclined and presents her with this engagement gift wrapped in a big red ribbon.  This scares away his high-school sweatheart as she interprets it as him being too imaginative and living in the fantasy-land than being a down-to-earth man, she'd prefer to be with.

Heartbroken, he ends up in a Hungarian restaurant to wash away his woes and eventually pours out his heart to a waitress, played by Goldie Hawn, who doesn't stop a beat to take advantage of the situation.  She is an adventurous free-spirit, endowed with wild imagination, who believes that life is to be experienced and she'll do whatever it takes to experience the richness of life.

After spending one night with the architect, she promptly packs and unbeknonst to him, move into his newly built house.  After all, why leave such a lovely house empty?  She quickly gets acquainted with local people, charges everything to the architect's account and gets to meet even his parents, to him she presents herself as the architect's wife.  As unique as she is - an acquired taste, as her make-believe inlaws would say, she has a very charming personality and everybody delights in her presence.  Whatever the situation, she always has a ready answer, often backed with a wild and outrageous story.

When Martin shows up at his newly-built house and finds her there, he is at first stunned, but figures that the only way to get out of it is by incorporating and continuing her make-believe stories and inventing that they are now getting divorced.  Not only her parents get involved, but also the local priest, who acts as a marriage counsellor, attempting to help them rescue the marriage.

Steve Martin is not so good at coming with impromptu answers and he usually botches things up, but Goldie Hawn, quite experienced at playing the game, always manages to rescue the situation.  She utterly enjoys playing the game and continues playing her own agenda.  She even manages to get him promoted.

All the events draw attention of his high-school sweatheart who develops some new interest in him - though they face themselves once again with their individual preferences as Martin discovers that he much prefers to live in a wild and imaginary world of Goldie Hawn, which has infused him with added spice and zest for life.",1102291200,31,2493,4.9
67587,4,078322740X,"I wish more projects were assembled for this tag-team of born screwball comedy geniuses, because ""Housesitter"" offers a great display of how well  Martin and Hawn work together onscreen.  Their senses of timing are tremendous and both have a gift for physical comedy and wringing the best out of every line of dialogue.  I disagree with the original Amazon staff reviewer (I believe the ""official"" Amazon review has since changed to a more positive judgment), I think this movie is very well constructed, with a tight plotline and just the right balance of jokes and exposition.  Not a word  or scene is wasted.  The humor is  absurdist but good-natured, as in older-style films, and the supporting cast does standout service.  This is a very underrated comedy, in my view, and I give it a high recommendation for fans of either of these fine actors or zany comedy in general.  A very refreshing change from in-you-face gross-out jokes and sophomoric scatalogical/sexual put-down gags that pass as ""comedy"" in so many films today. ""Housesitter"" just zips and zings along from one wild confrontation to another as the teetering house of lies constructed by Hawn (at first) and then Martin becomes ever-more unwieldy and incoherent.  Dana Delany plays a prim, preppy ""third wheel"" character with aplomb and the finale is  satisfying, funny,  and endearing.  Hugely entertaining and stands up tremendously well to repeated viewings!",1083715200,37,1429,5.134199134199134
67588,5,078322740X,"I won't bother to go over the story line of this flick, you can read some of the others for that.

67589,5,078322740X,"Forget what the uptight film critics had to say.  If you enjoy Steve Martin at his best, and if you're a fan of Goldie Hawn, this movie's a keeper.  Is it silly, goofy and a bit predictable?  Yes.  But who cares?  It's a comedy, and that's what's comedies should be.  Martin, Hawn, along with a wonderful supporting cast make for a memorable movie!...",988156800,,351,4.492063492063492
67590,3,078322740X,"Housesitter is an awful rewrite of the charming 1941 movie It Started with Eve. Unlike Deanna Durbin's character, who is honest and likeable, Goldie Hawn plays a pathological liar no decent person could respect. In fact, the whole plot of the original has been so cheapened that it's hard to accept any of the relationships between characters, or the final outcome. The two movies share a cast of characters in similar roles, and even humorous scenes like tripping over a living-room chair, but the wholesome quality of the original is totally lost in Housesitter. The film's only saving grace is the superb acting of its well-picked cast. The story line, though, has been shamefully distorted. I would expect a remake to improve on the original, but comparing these two films saddens me to think how far American screenwriting has deteriorated in the past 50 years.",982886400,8,866,4.979310344827586
67591,5,078322740X,"I remember being 14 and going to see this movie on opening weekend with my sister, I was a big Goldie Hawn fan at that point and I fell for her big time after seeing her in ""Overboard"", another underrated comedy from Goldie's cinema showcase. Even though this movie mostly got mixed reviews, I loved it instantly and ordered it constantly on PPV until I managed to get my hands on a tape of it. It is truly hilarious and the comedy team of Goldie Hawn & Steve Martin is absolutely magical perfection. This movie has so many laughs in it that one would be hard pressed to pick 1 certain defining moment but it is well worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh. Also recommended is Goldie's other hit from the summer of '92, ""Death Becomes Her"".",981158400,3,771,4.324137931034483

You know Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin have to be good. What you were not told was how great the supporting cast is. Donald Moffat ""The Bourne Identity""(1988), plays George Davis the estranged father that Gwen (Goldie Hawn) reconciles with son, Newton (Steve Martin). George asks, ""What do young people think marriage is today?"" Gwen asks, ""You don't want me to write and essay?""

Hawn over hears and decides to move into the house, martin mentions where it's located and hawn is off and running.  She gets to the house and starts fixing it up like, new funiture, rugs, pics. etc. She has now told this little back woods town, martin and her are married.

For the most part I don't really care for Steve Martin but there are two of his films that are a must for my library and this is one of them (The other being ""All of Me""). Goldie Hawn is hilarious as she cons an entire town, posing as Martin's wife, much to his chagrin. At the same time she has some of the most poignant lines ever uttered by a character in love. ""I found him and I saw what he was worth and I love him! (emphasis on the ""I"") Mind you, I may be misquoting but that is the general idea. (poor memory)

The way they could spin tales on the fly to any and everyone was just fun to watch. Had me laughing pretty regularly. Also, since we live in MA, we kept trying to guess what city/cities they used for Dobbs Mills town. The architecture firm owner, don't know his name, was also very good. Dana Delancy plays this spiffy preppy woman, and I really didn't like her that much, which I think means she did an ok job. It was hard to figure out if the Director was trying to get you to root for her or for Goldie Hawn.

Anyhow, it comes in at 90 minutes and I would recommend it to catch Martin and Hawn when they were still young enough to pull this off.",1379289600,,801,4.134615384615385

The only special features are a history of the production of the film and a trailer of the movie. Housesitter is really funny and the cast are the best.",1320105600,,517,4.954022988505747

68570,5,078322740X,"Perhaps Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn's best roles.  Pairing them together was a stroke of genius (and luck, as Hawn was the producer's third choice).  Destined to be a classic.

One disadvantage of downsizing films from theater screen to DVD is some action is edited out.  I noticed that some of Martin's physical comedy, such as during the hilarious party scene, doesn't show up when watching on a tv.",1307491200,,402,4.782608695652174

68572,5,078322740X,"Housesitter / 078322740X

A cute and zany rom com, ""Housesitter"" explores the world of an uptight straight man, frustrated in his personal and work lives. When Magic Pixie Dream Girl Hawn sweeps into his life and creates a fantastic fictional backstory for their romantic ""marriage"" (and her own colorful pedigree), Martin's character starts to see the possibilities when he realizes after his initial resistance that his coworkers, friends, and family prefer his ""new"" persona that Hawn has created for him.

Martin and Hawn work beautifully together here, in a classic comedy that still remains well-paced and very, very funny. As their characters begin to grow into their fictional personas, it is easy for the viewer to become caught up in the fantasy of reinventing yourself, perhaps into the person you always wanted to be but never dared to become.

Goldie Hawn is funny and her smile priceless. Although a fine comedienne, Goldie draws heavily on her spectacular legs and posterior in this movie. Fully aware of that, she doesn't hesitate making the most of them. However, the story is, as usual in this kind of movies, rather impossible and quite unbelievable, but it's good entertainment.

""Housesitter"" is one of the best comedies of the past 20 years and remains fresh and funny after repeated viewings.  Hawn as a chronic but charming liar and Martin as a man trying to jump-start his faltering personal and professional lives, make for a winning combination. The supporting cast is wonderful, with the street people Hawn hires to pose as her ""parents"" hilarious and yet touching.

68598,3,078322740X,"This is a charming, light, sweet screwball comedy, with an excellent ensemble cast all wonderful in their roles.  Goldie Hawn beautifully plays a charming, off-beat con artist, whose pathological lying and skewed take on reality unwittingly lead her to bring about genuine love and kindness.  Along the way, she reunites a family; sheds light on the old flame of her ""victim"" Steve Martin (exposing the motivations of the woman who broke his heart); and creates two new families -- proving that, in the movies at least, you may be able to make a silk purse from a sow's ear.

The couple Goldie's character enlists to play her parents are delightful.  So are the small-town characters and situations.  Though the overall plot may be somewhat predictable, enough surprises are sprinkled throughout to make the film enjoyable watching, again and again.  Heartwarming moments, and the lack of the modern age's gross-out techniques, are huge pluses, to this viewer.  Fans of whimsical, somewhat innocent light comedy likely will enjoy this film.

Steve and Goldie have great chemistry in ""Housesitter.""  Their roles here lack the sometimes-shrillness that marred their later pairing in the remake of ""The Out-Of-Towners"" (a film which did have some funny moments, by Steve, Goldie, and the hilarious John Cleese).  Well-written and well-acted subtlety make ""Housesitter"" a charming film to enjoy watching again over the years.

Steve Martin's wonderful dancing and physical comedy skills are not used a lot in ""Housesitter,"" but his great performance doesn't require them.  In fact, this role allows him to demonstrate his skill in pathos and dramatic acting.  (For a side-splittingly funny movie that showcases his excellence in dancing and physical comedy, there is the hilarious ""All of Me,"" whose wonderful cast includes superb performances by Lily Tomlin, Jason Bernard, Richard Libertini, and Victoria Tennant.)",1173830400,5,1912,5.354515050167224

If my wife didn't give me this for a birthday or something and I wasn't just in the mood to watch something different this evening I would have never picked up on this great little movie. We need to get the word out! My take: agreed this is a great team to pull this off. The non-surprise ending could have been so hoaky but they actually did it in a way I was glad Becky finally got left out of it. Let her find her own match if there is one. But I see a whole lot of depth in the whole point of this comedy. It is all true! None of this was a con. That is the beauty of it. The beauty of it is the con. This is so true in so many ways, and we love it and know we do. So the movie is not just cute, not just funny. It has a very serious point about life to make if we just see it.

She turned his marriage proposal down because she did not see the value in his creativity and vision.  We get a real sense of what Gwen is feeling the first time she sees the house. Imagine this: You are walking thru a brand new house that was custom designed by someone you know.  No one has ever lived in it, and the person it was offered to has turned it down. Gwen thought the house was so beautiful that she sat out side of the house and stared at it in amazement! Although she initially didn't want Newton around because of her con, we know that she could see the value of the man.  This is the focus of the story: not the house but the story of a woman recognizing the quailites of Newton.
