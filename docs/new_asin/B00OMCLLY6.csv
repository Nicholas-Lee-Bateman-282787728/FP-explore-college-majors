8684224,4,B00OMCLLY6,"Seems to be a promotional video for Ron Van Clief, but is interesting to see a philosophical look at martial arts, as how I've always known it. I was a student at Georg Mattson's school in Boston in 1976 and it was a great experience. The film had one of his students named, Campbell, and I think he was at the school when I attended. Some very good practitioners and a real community of martial artists. I remember one night watching home videos Mattson took when he visited master Ueichi in Okinawa. Several styles of kung-fu and karate players demonstrated their skills. This is the true martial arts, a focus on personal growth, as well as self-defense. The film's demonstrators all employ interesting techniques, but they are for demonstration, as the idea is to learn technique. You can tell there is a lot of cooperation. How can you learn if you're getting your bones broken every night? Some people are raising the MMA battles as the height of the arts, but in my opinion, they are only a crude version of the arts, lacking the variety of techniques shown in the film. Some people say it's real fighting. It is as far as its level of contact, but it's a sport with rules. Many of the MMA techniques, as far as these bouts, would not work in real life, not when strikes to the eyes, throat, and groin are disallowed. Real martial arts can't be practiced without the use of deadly force, and why is it necessary to prove you can maim someone. You develop confidence in martial arts. MMA seems to attract players who have no personal control, and therefore, the sport lacks dignity. So many players have abused partners, or as happened recently with Conor McGregor, perpetrated criminal behavior. Where is the personal growth? I took a class with Terry Dobson, one of the most famous American Aikido masters. He had the ability to allow a punch to pass his face, remaining unscathed. I know because I threw it. One of his students asked me to grab his arm. I did,and I couldn't hang on, as if he had some way of loosening my grip. Dobson told me he started Aikido to calm his angry disposition. That is what martial arts is about; not to become a mindless animal. Again, the film's fight scene are real, but the players, for good reason, are pulling their punches. That's how you learn.",1526601600,,2292,4.565533980582524
8684225,1,B00OMCLLY6,"I can't judge the quality, as it was made in the 1970s. However, the ""martial arts"" depicted in this movie are a prime example of the pseudo-bullsh*t that brainwashed Americans into think what they thought martial arts are. None of the techniques are real, or practical. It is nothing more than dance choreography. Its as fake as pro wrestling. Complete nonsense.",1525046400,,363,4.967213114754099
