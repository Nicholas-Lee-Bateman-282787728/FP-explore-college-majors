2453801,5,B000C65YZI,"I have developed pretty low expectations for hip-hop dance videos, as so many of them seem to be produced in a garage or with production value like they're from the 70s or something. But this one is different.  You will definitely be able to learn from this video as it is broken down quite well.

This is in my 3 favorite hip-hop instructional videos. This one is better for club dancing.

2453802,5,B000C65YZI,This video is great. I have 2 left feet and Kelly Peters shows me how to dance in such simple explanations that I can understand and do it with him a few times to understand. A def. must have!!,1170720000,2,193,3.9743589743589745
2453803,5,B000C65YZI,format of dvd definitely well done.  great for learning moves.  not the most entertaining or exciting to preview/watch.  but really good if you're ready to actually learn.,1169251200,2,171,5.2592592592592595
2453804,5,B000C65YZI,"I have rented every single dance video for breakdancing, hiphop, and krump available on Netflix (about 30) and bought the rest(another 10).  This one is the best for hiphop.  Most hiphop videos teach you a routine that requires about half of a large room by yourself to do and no way would help you in any social situation.  This video teaches you moves that can be done in little space like in a typical party.  Most of the videos also have lots of jazz type moves that are a little ridiculous.  Not this one.  Finally, the instruction is slow and paced so you can actually learn the move rather than watch the blurr and try to decipher it with the various slow motions of the DVD player (which is too time consuming).  I love this DVD.

  If you like this one you might also like ""Breakdancing Fundamentals"" as it is another well put together DVD, albeit with a different style of dance.  There are some other good breakdancing videos out there, but nothing decent in the hiphop genre that is practical and wellmade.

  I beg Kelly Peters to come out with volume 2!!",1167523200,82,1068,4.466321243523316
2453805,5,B000C65YZI,"If you're a beginner or someone w/ 2 left feet, this is the perfect video for you. Peters does a great job of walking you through the moves - starting you off slow and then progressively moving faster. The cool thing too is the way it's set-up such that what you see is a 'mirror' image so it's much more natural (see product description). All-in-all an excellent video.",1166054400,3,370,4.455882352941177
2453806,5,B000C65YZI,This video was well done. Some of the dance moves were from the 80's but still a good instructional video. Great for beginners.,1163462400,2,127,4.565217391304348
2453807,5,B000C65YZI,"This is a great start to learning how to dance this style...

The steps are presented in a modular fashion. And combinations of the steps with transitions are presented as well.",1161820800,3,177,4.709677419354839
2453808,5,B000C65YZI,"Excellent, easy to follow instruction and great, great fun. Split screen is right on target.  Why hasn't anybody else done that?  Most of the class seems to be comprised of kids in their youngish teens.  I suspect that there are younger, pre-teens also learning from this DVD. Don't be put off if you're a grown-up. I'm in my fifties and simply wanted to Hip Hop around the house.  Probably the best dance instruction video I've seen.  Kelly Peters is a remarkable teacher.  These kids are fortunate to have the opportunity to work with somebody so gifted.",1161561600,35,556,4.739583333333333
2453809,5,B000C65YZI,"I took a chance on this DVD and now all my friends borrow it...I can't say enough about it, it is the best instructional I have seen hands down.  Really great stuff, real easy pace, easy to learn from.",1160352000,4,201,4.153846153846154
2453810,5,B000C65YZI,"I don't normally write reviews, but this DVD is exceptional.  I bought this dvd for my daughter & it is broken down so well that it is like you are actually in his class.  I was skeptical as I have purchased other hip-hop DVD's before.  Kelly Peters makes it unbelievably easy to learn these basic moves & some not so basic.  Five stars, I'd give it more if I could.",1147910400,58,366,4.185714285714286
2453811,1,B000C65YZI,I watched this video and was totally disappointed for the fact that it was too basic and it didn't even have any real dance routines at all. The best part of the video was probably the baby freeze demo which I already have on another dvd.. this dvd is for young kids just learning to dance and thats it.. not worth my money at all.,1222992000,,331,4.107692307692307
2453812,4,B000C65YZI,"If you're a biggner and your looking for a DVD that teaches you step by step hip hop moves, then this is the right DVD for you.
it has great moves and very easy to implement I learned my moves in no time ;-p
its really really good and it works!!
I recomend this dvd for biggeners.",1218412800,2,280,3.9298245614035086
2453813,5,B000C65YZI,If you just get started I will say that this DVD is a very good choice.,1218153600,,71,3.5
2453814,4,B000C65YZI,"there are hella old school funk dances and club dances that are really simple and easy to do.  Ive been looking for the easy stuff.

If you take a ""hip hop"" class, they typically teach you music video choreography.  which is tight.  but you have to deconstruct it to get useful elements.

the only videos that show the basic easy stuff (ive found so far) is this one and some scam video made by losers.  i cant remember its name but its filled with fake reviews about how great it is.  yuck.

""make it happen"" shows some nice easy club moves.  they're not the newest.  but they're easy and stylish.  you may or may not know them, depending on how old you are, or what hood you grew up in.  i think they're targeted to teens.  the background dancers are all teens.

if you want to learn how to toe wop, or chicken noodle soup dance or spongebob, whatever check youtube.  but i was really happy with this purchase, i felt like i got my moneys worth.  and thats saying a lot with all the scam overpriced videos out there.",1213833600,,1018,4.278947368421052
2453815,5,B000C65YZI,"At first I was not sure if I liked this video but after watching all of it,it is perfect for the beginner and to learn different moves. He shows a mirror image and another image where you think you are behind him. He is very through. I bought this for my middle school Korean students to get a taste of one of the most popular dances in America today and also to let them know there is more than one way to learn English.",1212710400,2,421,4.023809523809524
2453816,1,B000C65YZI,"I ordered this dvd a month or so ago. I thought it would be a great exercise for me and have fun with my daughter who loves to dance (she is 7) I was in the middle of moving when I received the dvd so I didn't have time to open it. Yesterday my daughter opened the box and put in the dvd.. and it WAS NOT the dvd I ordered. The box was good, the dvd inside the box was some kind of a boring concert... Of course after the moving I can't find the receipt... What a disappointment.. Learn from my mistake: CHECK the dvd you get not just the box!",1210204800,,543,3.814159292035398

Solid instruction.  I agree with all the other reviewers who said that they could actually learn to hip-hop watching this DVD.  However, I feel this is only the start if you want to build enough repertoir to look cool at the club as the moves taught here are quite basic and somewhat dated.",1208908800,,481,6.484375
2453818,1,B000C65YZI,"After reading the reviews i thought since i haven't gotten out in a while and danced i would have to watch this video a couple of times to get it...WRONG..This video was extrememly boring, there wasn't music while he was teaching, the music that they did have was a slow beat.
The moves that he tought would be good for someone who has NEVER danced before. Someone who is just getting into the Hip-Hop scene. I would recommend this to a very young kid. I didn't enjoy this video and wish i would have gotten something else, if you learn fast, can dance with a partner to a song...dont buy this video thats all they teach you..and its not even good moves its moves from the 80s.  its a waste of time and money.

not satisfied.",1201910400,5,725,4.323529411764706
2453819,5,B000C65YZI,"Kelly Peters' Make It Happen video is great for children and adults alike who are interested in hip-hop dance but have never taken a class before. I bought the DVD knowing absolutely nothing about this style of dance other than what I had seen on music videos. Though, as I recently found out, Kelly is a dance instructor for children, it didn't make much of a difference for this video. In fact, I think it's better that way. The kids that dance in the background with Kelly are absolutely amazing, and gave me more energy and, perhaps, hope, than a group of 30-something pro dancers whose level of difficulty I feel I could never reach in my lifetime. Kelly Peters is a fantastic teacher who not only shows you some of the basic, classic hip-hop moves you can use to make your own combination (though they are not moves I would use to go clubbing or anything like that), but the history and elements of hip-hop culture as well. His energy and enthusiasm are contagious, and you'll find yourself hungry for more when the video ends.
  Never have I done a dance video with as good of instruction as this one. With other dance videos I've bought, I get extremely frustrated with how fast they go through the steps and get annoyed with having to constantly rewind, pause, and change to slow motion. Not only does Kelly go through each step very slowly and thoroughly, but there's also a split screen that makes the moves even easier to understand. Here's how the split screen works:

  On the left side of the screen is a view of Kelly from behind,
  like if you were standing behind him in a studio.

  The right side of the screen gives you a front view of Kelly that is
  like looking at a mirror. So instead of doing the opposite of what
  he does, you mirror him exactly.

  These two views make understanding and executing the moves SO much easier. Although you WILL probably have to go through the final combination several times to be able to do it nonstop without mistakes, he simplifies the individual moves so well that the rewind button will not need to be touched very often.
  There's also lots of extra features I really enjoyed, such as three bonus moves, which include The Wave and a break dance move called the Baby Freeze. I thought these were much tougher, but they're something fun to continue working on after you've finished the video. (It was really fun being able to show friends and family my first break dance move!) There's also a dance-off where you get to see Kelly's amazing kid dancers show their moves, and an interview with two talented choreographers. I highly recommend this video for anyone wanting to learn more about hip-hop, and I very anxiously await Volume 2!",1199318400,3,2699,4.573804573804574
2453820,3,B000C65YZI,"My godson and his brother partied to this DVD for about a week then grew tired with the corny music and hum-drum routines. Some of the dance moves are mature and suggestive but most children will have no idea about the steps they'll just innocently follow along.  I'm not certain whether or not this is a good thing. If I'd had the opportunity to preview this DVD I definitely would not have purchased it however, since I did buy it I can say that it was worth the money for the few days of rest it afforded my friend and her husband.  The more I think about it they might have simply played the video of their wedding reception for free and gotten a better response from the boys.",1183766400,2,681,4.271317829457364
2453821,3,B000C65YZI,"This video was decent at best. The dance instruction was very well done; however, the dance moves themselves were somewhat bland and basic. The dance moves seemed more fit for young teens or children and would probably be considered embarassing if an adult ever performed these moves in public. The video is more basic than I imagined, and it stays basic throughout the entire video. The bonus moves at the end were cool though.",1183420800,4,428,4.797297297297297
2453822,5,B000C65YZI,"I really loved the 'split screen with front and rear camera angles' technique.  My only beef was that the 45 degree rear angle sometimes obscured the instructor's arm/leg movements.  But I was usually able to switch my attention to the ""mirror image"" whenever this happened.  Very nicely paced for the those of us who need to see several repetitions of a movement, and, even though I couldn't always keep up with the background dancers in the 'put it all together' part of each segment, I had fun trying.",1178928000,3,504,4.704545454545454
2453823,4,B000C65YZI,"I partially agree with one of the reviewers who gave this product a one star. This DVD is not for you if you are already into Hip Hop. It just ""educates"" you about hiphop and as the product description says, it teaches you the most basic building blocks of hip hop like The Freak, The Prep, the Bus Stop and a few other steps. Go for it if you haven't danced before.

I think the cover photo is misleading because it makes the dvd look more advanced. Read the product description well before buying it. Do not conclude anything just from the reviews and the DVD cover or title. I take out one star for the misleading cover and title.",1178928000,10,633,4.275
2453824,5,B000C65YZI,"Some say this video only gives you the basics, but unless you wants to be a really showy dancer, you'll get an excellent repertoire moves. You can modify most of them even by changing angles. My ab muscles are really liking it too!

Awesome video- I highly recommend it!",1178928000,6,270,4.510204081632653
2453825,5,B000C65YZI,I bought it couple weeks ago. I had been searching for months. There are a lot of bad dvds everywhere. Most of dvds have very old choreography.this dvd is ok. Specially if you have no idea about hip-hop dance.you can learn somethings true.thank you Kelly Peters :)),1175385600,3,265,4.659574468085107
2453826,4,B000C65YZI,The teacher and instructional technologies are as good as other reviewers have already indicated.  The moves were a little too showcase for me.  I'm still looking for a good place to be introduced to Hip-Hop.  Every tape seems to expect you to already be an expert.,1175385600,2,265,4.717391304347826
2453827,1,B000C65YZI,"I purchased this DVD based on reviews i read.  I don't know what you guys were thinking.  Kelly Peters should be ashamed of himself for ripping of customers with this bootleg DVD.  This is volume 1, next cabbage patch on volume 2 LOL.  You learn NOTHING from this video.  Its a rip off.  This DVD is beyond Basic, its about 5 steps back before basics.  The ""special features"" is a joke.  Best thing about the DVD is the cover.

You can download better stuff of the net for FREE!!!

I usually trust ratings but this time I was in for an upset.

Reader trust me, this DVD is poor bootleg quality.  NOt only do i want my money back but i refuse to allow Kelly Peters to get rich by ripping of paying customers.

Have a nice day  :)",1175040000,19,728,4.143884892086331
2453828,5,B000C65YZI,"I have done other dance videos that are labeled ""hip hop"", however have rarely come across one that lived up to the title. This one does- hands down. Another one I would recommend if you're interested in this one is ""Hip Hop Shop"" for a more introductory level taste.

You can see a preview of Kelly Peters DVD on his website as well if you want more information.",1174262400,9,363,4.338235294117647
2453829,5,B000C65YZI,"My kids love this video. They are 12, 10 and 7. The video is set up so the steps are easy to learn, and then you can apply them to music.  Really nicely done!",1174262400,3,158,3.6470588235294117
2453830,1,B000C65YZI,"This video is a joke.  If you want to learn some real choreography or dance steps, don't expect to get it from this video.  It just shows you a bunch of pelvic thrust and really corny moves that would get you laughed at if you attempted to do it on the dance floor.  This video is for people who have no knowledge of Hip-Hop.  Please spare me the close-up of the pelvic thrust...  You would get a good laugh but it's a waste of money.  I very much regret of getting it.",1173052800,6,469,4.043478260869565

Its super simple because he breaks it down into one movement at a time and then slowly puts it together for you to follow. If you have no dancing background, you can still be dancing simple hiphop moves in about an hour. Plus it works you out, without even realizing you were getting in shape because it's fun!",1355529600,,432,4.280487804878049

8096147,5,B000C65YZI,"I purchased this dvd with the purpose of adding some new moves to my repertoire.  The clubs I go to are mostly country but often throw in some hip hop music and few of use know what to do when this music pumps through the speakers.

Kelly breaks down the steps of each move, goes over them front to back and then practices them with you multiple times.  This made it easy for me to follow without having to pause or rewind too frequently.

I would not consider myself a very coordinated person and yet somehow I was able to walk away from this dvd feeling confident with the moves I had learned.

This was a 6 star dvd and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning some hip hop moves.",1295395200,,697,4.2105263157894735
8096148,1,B000C65YZI,"I think this DVD is popular because Kelly Peters explains the moves quite well, and since the moves are really basic, nearly anyone can pull them off. However I would add a note of caution. The number of moves presented in the DVD is extremely small. Also the moves are extremely basic, and probably are not going to look good either in a dance performance (unless you are in the 1st grade), or in a club. People looking for a thorough introduction to hiphop dance are better off looking elsewhere. I think Kelly Peters could produce a good DVD, but he needs to choose some better moves and also show how to do more of them. I've looked at a few hip hop dance dvds and they seem to fall into one of three categories: Present a few really basic and dated moves; focus on an aerobic style workout with a few pseudo hip-hop moves thrown in for good measure; or dive right into a fairly advanced hip-hop dance routine more suitable for professional dancers. Be careful which DVDs you buy because you may not get what you are looking for !",1276560000,4,1034,4.390625
8096149,4,B000C65YZI,"I bought this because I'm teaching an after-school hip-hop class to 3rd-5th grade students. I found the video very informative with great moves, and he broke them down really well, made them very easy to learn. But the routine he taught was not really meant for a performance, just practice for the learned moves. Also the were some moves I can't teach to these young children without offending some parents. All-in-all, a very informative video. I've already started incorporating what I learned into the choreography for my weekend band, and it's been great.",1267315200,2,560,5.032258064516129
