221572,1,6300186806,"For some ungodly reason, I rented this one night and will live to regret it. The plot, which is nearly nonexistent, is about a therapist, whose name I don't remember, who is being stalked by some sick, burly killer who kills  women by violently strangling them after giving a call to the therapist to  occasionally scare the hell out of her. Well, I think that's the plot. All  I remember is the psychologist getting terrorized from time to time, some  big fat killer raping and killing a countless number of women, and two  unprofessional detectives chasing the guy down. That's it, that's the plot.  Non of the victims are really characters, spare the first one, a past child  abuse victim whose father molested her at a young age. She goes to the  therapist, and is stalked home and subsequently raped and killed. It was  one of the most tasteless pieces of cinema I've ever seen.
The  ""climax"" is a bit disturbing, when the killer finally closes in  on the therapist at her home, beats her, ties her to a chair, and screams  at her. It all ends pretty abruptly, and I was glad, cuz I couldn't sit  through this much more. I don't recommend this at all, not even for fans of  horror films that show far more nudity than horror. It's sick, twisted, and  amongst all that, mind-numbingly unentertaining, for many reasons. DO NOT  GET THIS MOVIE! And if you do...well, knock yourself out.",958780800,2,1388,4.604081632653061

221610,3,6300186806,"This review is for Young Graduates and not Don't Answer the Phone which somehow Amazon has lumped together.

This is the grand age of fashion with mini skirts and bell bottoms. Rock and roll bands must have a keyboard and the girls tried to look like Marsha Brady. Mindy (Patricia Wymer) turned 18 and doesn't want to put out to her boyfriend Bill (Gary Rist), but his willing to have an affair with her teacher (Steven Stewart) in an age when people weren't as uptight over these things...notice her joke at the end of the film. She runs off with her girlfriend (Marly Holiday) and not every biker and redneck they meet on the road has good intentions.

This is a very boring film for plot. It doesn't go anywhere. 1971 drive-in fodder.

221651,5,6300186806,"With the release of the restored uncut version of Don't Answer The Phone, we see the Katarina's Nightmare Theater series getting back on track after the disappointing The Day After Halloween (we won't go there). This is a release worthy under their banner, as DATP is a low-budget, sleazy piece of exploitation featuring genre favorite Nicolas Worth (recognizeable to genre fans for his appearance in Wes Craven's Swamp Thing, Darkman, and others).

I usually like to go into in-depth reviews, but it's basically like this: Misogynistic cult wierdo photographer goes on a killing spree, strangling women but not before removing their garments for kicks. The violence is unsettling, but as Nicolas states in his interview (and I concur), this really is just a T&A film at heart, but thats great because without it, the rest of the film wouldn't work. Nicolas' portrayal of the killer is sometimes convincing and other times down right humorous. Just check out some of the faces he makes during his freakout moments (sort of a laughing/crying combo). Maybe it was the beer, but I was hollering.

This film is perfect for a late night sleaze sandwich and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. Too obscure for the casual cult exploitation fan, but for horror die-hards who think they have it all, you will want this in your collection. Just be warned, it is a misogynistic film, so definitely not a first-date kind of film (unless you have a really great date).

Keep it up Scorpion Releasing. And Katarina, if you are reading this, you are as charming as ever. Can't wait for American Nightmare.

221652,5,6300186806,I saw this movie in 81 at the main post theater at Ft. Benning it was a 930 pm showing I remember thinking it was pretty good I tried for years to find it.

221653,4,6300186806,"I was channel surfing one night and was fortunate to find this film in its unexpurgated form on IFC.  It is an excellent period piece, released in 1980 and chock full of funky Afros, residual 70's era bad clothing choices and mixtures of odd fabric patterns.  There are obligatory shots of breasts and, quite frankly, it's fabulous to see ""natural"" breast and not the implant-fake things actresses wear these days. I agree with other reviewers; Nicholas Worth emotes way beyond the call of duty as the serial killer.  The end scene, which I will not give away lest someone actually wish to view this film and not have it spoiled, is something to behold.  Why Worth was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me.  Of course, I'm being facetious, but truly, his performance should be viewed by any serious fan of film-making.  It's not clear why the title ""Don't Answer The Phone"" is relevant to the victims, unless it is solely in reference to the psychologist with a radio show who takes a few phone calls from the killer.  This is an awful film, but if you stick with it you will be entertained.  A glass or two of wine helps.",1331942400,,1125,4.534653465346534
221654,4,6300186806,"This low-budget exploitative thriller has had a hard life, thanks to a lot of professional critics, moralistic censors, and the typical disdain cast upon it by those who dismiss it as pure sleaze.  Heck, it even had a title that has nothing to do with the movie foisted upon it by its distributor.  When viewed in all of its original, uncut glory, though, this is a darn good film, full of the gritty, in-your-face violence that most directors steer clear of.  Yes, there's nudity, sleaze, violence, and racist elements in this movie, all the things the politically correct crowd wants to protect us from.  Frankly, we're actually quite fortunate this film ever got restored to its original version after suffering two different cinematic castrations robbing it of a full nine minutes.  The holier-than-thou critics certainly aren't happy about it, warning their minions to avoid this sick film, but have none of that, my friends.  We're not little babies who have to be protected from the reality of violence or to be constantly nannied by some self-appointed guardians of cinema.  If ""they"" don't want you to see this movie, that's more than enough reason for you to see it.  As far as regular viewers go, some pin the ""so bad it's good"" label on the movie, but I'm in the ""so good it's good"" camp.  I think opinions are divided based on Nicholas Worth's powerful performance as the killer - to some, he's over the top and almost comical at times, but I think he gives a spot-on performance of a seriously disturbed serial rapist/killer.

The killer in this movie has a boring name, no distinguishing characteristics apart from stockiness, never even acquires a media-generated nickname, and has a fetish for women's stockings - but he doesn't let that get him down.  Whatever you think of Nicholas Worth's performance, I think all will agree that it is certainly memorable.  He can charm his way into a house and lure many a young woman to his studio for a photo shoot, only to turn on a dime into a sadistic torturer and killer.  Alone at home - usually working out - his dark side is amply revealed by conversations with himself and his father's spirit.  He is a deranged, formidable killer who actually goes so far as to sell pornographic photos of his victims.

Naturally, the cops are working hard to identity and arrest the man going around strangling and sexually abusing (in that order, I might add) young women in Hollywood.  The lead investigators are Lt. Chris McCabe (James Westmoreland), who takes his work very seriously, and Sgt. Hatcher (Ben Frank), who manages to have a good time even (or should I say especially) while investigating the sleaziest of crimes.  Then there's Dr. Lindsay Gale (Flo Lawrence - as Flo Gerrish), a local psychologist with her own radio show, a show which - unbeknownst to her at the time - actually fields several calls from the strangler.  The relationships of these characters actually develop along pretty predictable lines, but that takes little away from the ultimate confrontation at the end.

For a low-budget 1980 film made primarily for drive-in audiences, I think this movie is quite impressive.  I don't think the acting is all that bad, the comical elements work quite well (where else are you going to see a lady snorting coke off a bald man's head?), and there's a definite element of suspense leading up to the conclusion.  As for the nudity and violence, it's actually rather tame by today's standards, which makes it even harder for me to understand why some critics seemingly equate this film with low class pornography.  Don't Answer the Phone, for my money, is one of the best movies of its kind.  Don't see it because I told you to, though - see it because ""they"" are telling you not to.  Just make sure you get the uncut version.",1324080000,5,3799,4.764885496183206

The film displays the adventures of blonde Mindy (Patricia Wymer), a recent high school graduate who's enjoying an affair with a slightly older teacher while still making time to hang out with hippies, bikers, and stoners.  The interesting note here is that the film is more coming-of-age than exploitative.  Although some of the dialog sounds as though it was written by a middle-aged scribe trying to sound ""hep and with-it,"" the film endures as a period piece that deftly captures the spirit of the early seventies' youth culture.

221695,4,6300186806,"This movie is about a man who can kill from training but must kill, and does.  Two somewhat inept police detectives track the killer and well...go watch it.  But it's not plot driven, it's character driven.  It's the rawness, the grittiness of Los Angeles in the 70s.  The locations are real.  There are no sound stages (nor permits when it was filmed) and if you see a drug dealer or drug user in the background...well he wasn't an extra if you get my drift.  The movie is raw as well as it's flawed characters.  The two cops assigned are jaded from being on the job and the killer, who is almost untracable but kills in a certain way of strangulation popular in Vietnam at the time, are what they have to go on.  One cop doesn't even care much about the vics and appears drunk sometimes; the other (the lead) is only interested in catching the killer when he starts to romantically like the Phone Psychologist.  Hence the title, don't answer the phone becuase he calls in his kills to the Psychologist who everybody knows is going to be on his kill radar at some point. *This was lost on one reviwer.*  They aren't supermen, they are very flawed heroes, conversly you have a killer who knows who he is and likes it with no reason to kill but that when he isn't killing he is lifting weights.  The only people who are perfect are those the killer kills.

""Don't Answer the Phone"" started the slew of cult horror movie titles that found their antecedent in that title.  You couldn't do anything because someone was warning you not to do.

There are two innovations never done in a movie before that nobody has seemed to pick up on yet: one being that this is the first movie that had hand held shots from the villian's point of view are used; the second is that the score was done on the fly when the composer was watching the film so the feelings and mood are what the moods and feelings he was feeling at the time, so within the moment is where the score resides. Fans of Sartre will understand.

To answer the reviewer below who obviously didn't research any of the stir this movie made when it hit the original screen, the reason it wasn't titled ""Hollywood Strangler"" is because there actually was a serial killer in Hollywood during that time and so the original title was scrapped.  Like having a movie called ""The Zodiac Killer"" DURING the Zodiac killings.

The reason the credit is Robert Hammer is because he wrote, directed, produced and filmed it.  This was Indie before it became Indie and guerrilla filmmaking before there was a name for it.  The only thing that was out of his vision is the T&A that Hammer didn't want in there but that the financial backers did.  So it got sexed up a lot more, but what movie didn't have that happen to it?

While the review inquired below why this was Robert Hammer's only movie, after doing that movie he went on to get an BA in Finance and an MBA in International Finance at Pepperdine Univ. at Malibu and has been the CFO of CTB/MacMillon McGraw-HIll, MySimon (from the inception) and then CNET as well as some start ups in Silicon Valley.  Had the reviewer seen the director's commentary (or do an internet check) he might know any of this...but obviously he'd rather trash a movie he didn't understand.  That's probably why Rhino digitally remastered it, gave the uncut version and re-released it.  Or do movies have that happen to NOT make money?

By far this is Nicholas Worth's best performance as another wrote.  He was 'method' as well as the other performers and when you see a chock or a slap...it's real.  Nicolas Worth was also classically trained AND served as Special Forces in Vietnam.

Rhino, the Indie House, has put this out, so I recommend you watch it or buy it, I don't care, but give it a look since obviously Rhino thinks it's a classic.",1215302400,,3813,4.48695652173913

7804510,1,6300186806,"Don't Answer the Phone is an unusually seedy 1980 body count thriller that isn't exactly a slasher film since the killer does no actual slashing--instead, he rapes and strangles women.  The opening scene seems to depict him murdering a woman and then sexually assaulting her dead body but the police later on the scene say that she was alive while being sexually assaulted and then killed.  A radio news show reporting on the murder includes the statement that women should be careful when walking alone at night--but the first victim was murdered inside her own home, so the warning really doesn't really make much sense.

The second rape and murder is equally confounding because it suggests that either the serial killer had a previous sexual relationship with the woman (in which case why is he making her his seventh victim) or that he has intimate details about what she told her therapist--and if that's the case exactly how?

Then we get to the third rape and murder.  This time there's no doubt that he kills the woman first but when the police find her body they say that the M.O. exactly matches the previous victims.  As if the movie wasn't already idiotic enough a psychic comes into the police station and gives the two detectives working the case such detailed and on the nose information that they arrest him figuring he must be the perp.  Then in the very next scene, they are laughing at the fact that the psychic was seven thousand miles away at the time of the previous crime and couldn't be their man.  Instead of joking about arresting the amazingly accurate psychic by mistake shouldn't they be using him to help stop the killer?  And why doesn't the way we are told the crimes were committed ever match up with what we are actually shown onscreen?

Don't Answer the Phone! has pretty much only one thing going for it--Nicholas Worth makes for a genuinely skin crawling psychopath.  Just watching him onscreen for two minutes is enough to make you feel like you need to take a shower.  Unfortunately, nothing else works.  It's a toss-up which is worse--the writing or the acting.  The murders are all monotonously similar.  The production values barely rise to the level of what you would expect to see in a porn film but without the redeeming elements of nudity and sex.  There is no suspense or tension whatsoever and the film ultimately feels like a sleazy police procedural made by people who learned everything they know about crime investigation from watching old episodes of Mannix and Cannon.  It would be a challenge to name any theatrically released 1980's body count film that is actually worse than Don't Answer the Phone!
