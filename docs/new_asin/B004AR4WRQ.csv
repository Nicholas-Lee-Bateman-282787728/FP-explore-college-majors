4310730,4,B004AR4WRQ,"""VOVA : making stuff ""are great  introductions to science. Our whole family love watching it. There are so many amazing technology development that we took for granted before.

However, I found it was not easy to watch the video from the online library. Image screen would be lost if I tried to enlarge the screen to full page. I had to restart the video again and again from the beginning. This is the only drawback I have encountered. Otherwise I love the Nova videos.",1349654400,5,470,4.583333333333333
4310731,5,B004AR4WRQ,"My background is Materials Science and Engineering, which is what this program focuses on, and it has a lot of great information in it. It was good to reminisce about all the things I learned in college and now never use. I think they should show this (or at least mention it) to other engineering students.

Now, however, I teach middle school level science and throughout the year I showed the kids this series. They loved it! It really showed them how the science they were learning could have real world uses, and they would ask me tons of questions from the video. We recreated standing on a wine glass, and I bought some MR fluid from amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ferrofluid-60-cc-bottle-GREAT-FOR-SCIENCE-PROJECTS/dp/B00126P1NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ferrofluid - 60 cc bottle, GREAT FOR SCIENCE PROJECTS</a>, put it in a large plastic juice bottle, and let them play with it and magnets (don't open the bottle, if it gets on clothing it will stain). There are several other things they show that you could reproduce in class.

Highly recommended for kids through adults interested in technology beyond just digital technology (though it has some of that, too.)",1346112000,23,1225,5.442105263157894
4310732,5,B004AR4WRQ,"I have enjoyed Amazon prime for a couple of years now, but have only recently taken advantage of the unlimited video streaming.
It is great to have at my fingertips all the free and reduce priced video's to watch from Amazon on my laptop, desktop, and/or my Kindle at any time. I also like the fact that I can leave a streaming video and pickup watching it again later.

NOVA: Making Stuff, ""Stronger"" is just one of many shows that I have watched.",1342828800,,448,4.397590361445783
4310733,5,B004AR4WRQ,"I watched this on Netflix, which was probably a good decision, since every fifteen minutes I would have to pause it, call my boyfriend into the room, rewind it, and then watch it all over again. There are some amazing developments chronicled in this series, a lot of which have an ""I want that!"" quality to them. The host is pretty freakin' funny, as well. He's not somber or pedantic in any way.

Perhaps one of the best things about this Nova series is that it's easy to understand (as far as Nova science and technology features are concerned). For many Nova series (think Brian Greene...) I find myself needing to pause and take a break/give my brain a rest. While those are still great and thought-provoking, this series is much less work without sacraficing any of the mind stimulation that so often leads to my conversations after Nova :)",1320883200,25,845,4.633333333333334

Knowing that I just bought something that supports him, especially something to do with science, really really upsets me.
He's one of the richest people in the world and has used a ton of money to write and fund legislation that makes the lower and middle classes poorer while making the rich even richer (he played a major role in the demise of teacher unions in states like Wisconsin, also he's responsible for ""Right to Work (for less)"" states.  He's also a known anti-global warming enthusiast.

8420684,5,B004AR4WRQ,"From the same brains that brought you the other NOVA programs, 'Making Stuff' is another classroom-worthy series dedicated to materials science and engineering.  It combines real-world demonstrations and computer graphics to engage the audience and to deliver their message so that it sticks.  David Pogue frames current engineering challenges with the cutting edge of materials science, focusing on a single aspect of the discipline per show.  This brief but engrossing series follows the same formula laid out by other NOVA shows running back to 1974: clear writing, consistent pacing and crisp editing.  PBS delivers again with high-quality media that is ready for a quiet evening on the couch or a classroom premier to encourage creativity and science literacy.",1509321600,,765,5.4576271186440675
8420685,5,B004AR4WRQ,"The following is a letter I wrote to David Pogue who stars in this show (somewhat edited to publish here as a review).  I think it sums up why I gave this program a 5 star review.

Mr. Pogue was kind enough to reply and indicated that he's open to producing more shows if NOVA asks him.  Write to NOVA and let them know!

----
Dear. Mr. Pogue,

My kids and I thoroughly enjoyed your NOVA productions, ""Hunting the Elements"" and the ""Making Stuff"" series. Please consider talking to NOVA about producing more science programs like this.

I am a science enthusiast who grew up on PBS shows like NOVA and National Geographic and Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Kids (and adults) today are so science illiterate due in part to the fact that science shows today are so boring. Even the new Cosmos show with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Sorry, but it's a yawner!

Most of today's science education programs are not fun or interesting to the general population. And they're not inspiring. We've lost something in the last 30 years. Science popularizers like Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye are struggling to bring it back, but they haven't found the right formula (no pun intended). I'm happy for what they're doing, but neither has the humble charm of Carl Sagan. But you do!

But there's more to a program like this than just the personality of the narrator.  Kids these days have a Youtube attention span. (And for that reason, I think even the original Cosmos series, as interesting as it was to me, would fail for today's generation).  It's tough to engage with today's kids (or even adults!) in a 1 or 2-hour special.  Yes, there are some good science programs on Youtube, like Veritasium or It's OK to be Smart, but such programs can't go into the depth that a NOVA special can, and neither can they get access to the resources and facilities that NOVA can.  It's expensive to make a program like this.  The producers of this program have have put in just the right mix of in-depth instruction, animation, talking heads, and humor that has captivated my kids like no other recent science or technology programming has. For the first time ever, my son has actually retained a large portion of what he's learned from the Elements program and asks for more.

I know you are not a scientist and you are mostly a tech writer, but you really come into your own when talking about science.

I watched Hunting the Elements and we're partway through the Making Stuff shows with my children (9 and 11), and for the first time --ever -- they are genuinely interested in science programming that is beyond the length of a Youtube short feature.

I don't care if my kids grow up to be scientists. I do care that they have an appreciation for the methodology of science and the wonder of learning about nature, because that spark of wonder so important even if they're only peripherally involved with chemistry or physics or space or whatever, in their lifetimes.

 I bought both Hunting the Elements and the Making Stuff series on blu-ray after we first saw it on the PBS app in our TV.

You and NOVA have a winning formula! Please talk to NOVA about starring in more science shows.",1498608000,,3151,4.5846702317290555
8420686,5,B004AR4WRQ,My students and I had great discussions after viewing the different sections of Making Stuff...,1486252800,,95,5.4
