8619606,5,B00FYYLS1M,This is an informative and very intensive study by relatively unknown Pastor Anderson that compliments After The Tribulation by the same producer.  Too bad this set can't be made more affordable as amazon will not allow this title to be open to other sellers without an expensive upgrade to their membership. It is much easier to find this item (and at a better price) on ebay. Cheers,1489449600,,384,4.731343283582089

8619608,5,B00FYYLS1M,"This is an excellent study and Pastor Anderson is very good and thorough.
If you are not a serious student of the Bible then this is not for you.
This is the best study of revelation that cross references the rest of the Bible I have seen ever.
This is not an ear tickling series.
If you have never read the entire Bible and watch lots of TV - you shall not be blessed with this video series
I have an earned masters degree in the Bible so this is not new to me.",1395014400,3,462,3.925531914893617
