3038746,5,B000Z8H1YA,I got this for my mother and she loves it.  These are performances that are rarely shown on TV and she enjoys getting to see country music legends in their prime.,1254355200,,162,4.225806451612903
3038747,5,B000Z8H1YA,"This is better than I anticipated, especially to see and hear those who are not with us any longer due to passing on, retirement or just being out of the spotlight. I felt younger (and healthier) just playing this dvd. It reminds me how great country music used to be and how much current day country has strayed from its roots. This was a great buy.",1247011200,,350,4.318181818181818
3038748,4,B000Z8H1YA,"I got it for my mom for Christmas.  Here it is mid-March and she's still watching it almost every day.

I found it interesting (actually a little frightening) to look at the ""old"" country stars from my youth who now look young, compared to me.

The interviews were a little disappointing but the Grand Ol' Opry performances are fun to watch.

Not sure it's worth the price ... It did make my ma happy though, so I guess that justifies it.",1237420800,,438,4.37037037037037

3038750,5,B000Z8H1YA,"Fantastic collection of old country stars performing live (you know, back when country was really *country*, and not the garbage that passes for ""country"" nowadays). The interviews on each DVD are priceless as well. I bought one for me and one for my parents. I highly recommend buying this DVD collection.",1216166400,14,306,5.019607843137255

3038752,5,B000Z8H1YA,"This 8 dvd boxed set to me, has the cream of Country music. Coming from Sydney, Australia & being a Rock & Roll fan of the late 50's & early 60's the main US Country artists that I knew were the crossover artists, Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, Faron Young etc, I had heard of the Grand Ole Opry but never really knew much about it.
 All the dvds are extremely good quality & the later performances are in colour.
This box set gave me a chance to see performances from artists that I had only heard singing their hits.
The Browns, Ernest Ashworth, Don Gibson, Henson Cargill, Billy Carlisle,
George Morgan, Jack Blanchard & Misty Morgan, Freddie Hart, Hank Locklin & David Houston.
I was looking though the dvds individually & could not decide which ones to buy as they all had 15 live performances, & there were lots tracks on each of them that i wanted. It was easier to buy the complete set.
I thought some of the clips would be out of ""Second Fiddle To A Steel Guitar"",""Country Music On Broadway"" & ""The Leroy Van Dyke"" TV series. I was pleased that they were all different performances.
I am hoping that Time Life will hurry up & bring out more dvds of this quality, well worth the money.",1198195200,44,1190,4.384615384615385
3038753,5,B000Z8H1YA,"This 8-DVD box set, compiled by Time-Life Books and the folks at the Grand Ole Opry, collects 120 video performances by many of the greatest country musicians of the 1950s, '60s and '70s.  Each disc includes fifteen live performances (and no lip-syncing, as far as I can tell...) along with bonus features such as interviews with various Opry veterans.  The material is drawn from old Opry TV broadcasts and other venues such as ""The Bobby Lord Show"" and other, long-forgotten shows that were the country equivalents of ""Soul Train"" and ""American Bandstand.""  The video quality is very good and the sound quality is excellent -- it's a chance to see stars such as Bill Anderson, Patsy Cline, George Jones, Loretta Lynn, Barbara Mandrell, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Webb Pierce, Ray Price, Porter Wagoner, Tammy Wynette and many, many others playing at the peak of their powers.  In many cases they were also at the start of their careers, and just starting to learn the ropes.  The set also includes a surprisingly strong representation of lesser-known artists, folks like Bill Phillips, Jeannie Seely, Jeannie Pruett and others, great singers who were hitmakers many years ago, but are remembered only by a few fans today.  This is a marvelous collection that truly honors the history of country music (and of the Nashville music business) without cutting corners or playing it safe.  The discs also are offered individually, organized by themes that are actually quite useful.  Some of the most rewarding volumes are the ""Pioneers"" set, ""Queens Of Country"" and the ""Duets"" disc, which features many gems, among them a bluesy performance from Patsy Cline, who sang with other artists live, but never actually recorded any duets on record.

If you want a fun, high-class collection that shows many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, this collection is a true gift.  Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1196035200,71,1964,5.068322981366459

I sang along to most of them. some I did not remember but most I sure did. my parents loved these songs and I grew up singing along . the box is nice, each dvd has its own plastic case with artwork theme of the 15 performances on the front and list of songs and artists listed on the back. The price is not cheap but for something that is such trip down memory lane, you cant beat it. I also bought the second in this set. Opry Video Classics 2 which has 8 more disks and all different songs.. have not received them yet but hope they arrive soon and are as great as these.",1412467200,4,704,4.035714285714286

We knew most of the songs and stars but hadn't seen them perform in years.  Now we can see them on demand.  All country music fans would love this collection.  The younger fans might be seeing some stars that they had not seen or even heard of before.  The delivery, packaging  and function were all fine with no problems.",1396051200,,498,4.395604395604396
3038794,3,B000Z8H1YA,"I was somewhat disappointed that there was so little of the original show and that  TIME-LIFE left out so many of the original stars of the show. I also felt that with only 15 performances on each disc, they could have put the entire series on one disc and sold it for a more reasonable price. I would advise buyers to research and locate the package that includes full episodes of the show and one that offers a more complete collection of the GRAND OL OPRY. I did enjoy what there was to watch but I hardly think that it was worth what TIME-LIFE charges for it.",1395705600,3,563,4.261682242990654

3038799,3,B000Z8H1YA,"Overall it is okay - would have preferred it lean more towards complete ""show"" of the Opry with more star interaction.
These DVD's brought back so many great memories.
If you like the Doo-Wop music DVD's - this group of DVD's from the Opry will be what you want.

I was hoping for more along the lines of (Red Foley's-Ozark Jubilee) - Grand Ole Opry half-hour to hour productions.  However it's still great seeing the Stars in their prime!!!",1379548800,3,441,4.569620253164557
3038800,5,B000Z8H1YA,"My dad has always loved the old country singers and this is just perfect for him. He doesn't get out much and mostly watches tv , so this is something different and fun for him.  I would highly recommend it!",1375833600,2,207,4.175
3038801,5,B000Z8H1YA,"My wife and I perform Opry style variety shows in NYC ,this was an  invaulable resource.
It featured footage of songs we'd never heard by big name artists like Patsy Cline ,good ones not outakes or schlock . Amazing to see the artists in context, with the show , its emcee's  and the performance space . After watching TV specials , youtubes and gazing at pictures in books its so exciting to have so many artists performances to choose from on my TV , whenever I wish.
I wish this type of collection existed for other Tv programs like Barndance and the Gene Autry ranch show . A great buy, I almost ordered specific discs but the impact and breadth of this collection makes it a ""must Have "" , one disc would leave you unsatisfied .",1371254400,,733,4.343065693430657

performances, and that says it all, in my opinion!",1325462400,2,422,4.397435897435898
3038807,4,B000Z8H1YA,"This DVD contains video clips from several venues, and of numerous great players. I purchased this video set by mistake, thinking it was the Larry Black produced series. I will say, that this set is period correct, in that the stars were filmed singing their hits, at the time the hits were big.

I personally miss the camaraderie that is more evident on the Countrys Family Reunion set, but do not take it wrong~this is a true representation of the hitmakers of the day, and their most famous songs, performed by the hitmakers themselves.

But, as I stated, the CFR is just more preferable and entertaining in my opinion.",1310601600,10,622,4.697247706422019

Although, it should be noted that not all videos are from the Opry, some are from That Nashville Music & The Bobby Lord Show.  It doesn't matter though this collection has everything you can expect from Roy Acuff, Grandpa Jones to Loretta Lynn & Tammy Wynette.  I remember seeing some of these shows during the 60's.  Funny how the clothing style has changed but not the great sound of the music.  If you should decide to purchase you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.",1307923200,2,512,4.582417582417582

In many cases they were also at the start of their careers, and just starting to learn the ropes.  The set also includes a surprisingly strong representation of lesser-known artists, folks like Bill Phillips, Jeannie Seely, Jeannie Pruett and others, great singers who were hitmakers many years ago, but are remembered only by a few fans today.  This is a marvelous collection that truly honors the history of country music (and of the Nashville music business) without cutting corners or playing it safe.  The discs also are offered individually, organized by themes that are actually quite useful.  Some of the most rewarding volumes are the ""Pioneers"" set, ""Queens Of Country"" and the ""Duets"" disc, which features many gems, among them a bluesy performance from Patsy Cline, who sang with other artists live, but never actually recorded any duets on record.

If you want a fun, high-class collection that shows many of the biggest stars in Nashville playing real, honest country music, this collection is a true gift.  Highly recommended!  (DJ Joe Sixpack / Slipcue music reviews)",1196035200,71,1964,5.068322981366459

I sang along to most of them. some I did not remember but most I sure did. my parents loved these songs and I grew up singing along . the box is nice, each dvd has its own plastic case with artwork theme of the 15 performances on the front and list of songs and artists listed on the back. The price is not cheap but for something that is such trip down memory lane, you cant beat it. I also bought the second in this set. Opry Video Classics 2 which has 8 more disks and all different songs.. have not received them yet but hope they arrive soon and are as great as these.",1412467200,4,704,4.035714285714286

We knew most of the songs and stars but hadn't seen them perform in years.  Now we can see them on demand.  All country music fans would love this collection.

3273291,3,B000Z8H1YA,"I was somewhat disappointed that there was so little of the original show and that  TIME-LIFE left out so many of the original stars of the show. I also felt that with only 15 performances on each disc, they could have put the entire series on one disc and sold it for a more reasonable price. I would advise buyers to research and locate the package that includes full episodes of the show and one that offers a more complete collection of the GRAND OL OPRY. I did enjoy what there was to watch but I hardly think that it was worth what TIME-LIFE charges for it.",1395705600,3,563,4.261682242990654

These DVD's brought back so many great memories.
If you like the Doo-Wop music DVD's - this group of DVD's from the Opry will be what you want.

I was hoping for more along the lines of (Red Foley's-Ozark Jubilee) - Grand Ole Opry half-hour to hour productions.  However it's still great seeing the Stars in their prime!!!",1379548800,3,441,4.569620253164557

3273298,5,B000Z8H1YA,"My wife and I perform Opry style variety shows in NYC ,this was an  invaulable resource.
It featured footage of songs we'd never heard by big name artists like Patsy Cline ,good ones not outakes or schlock . Amazing to see the artists in context, with the show , its emcee's  and the performance space . After watching TV specials , youtubes and gazing at pictures in books its so exciting to have so many artists performances to choose from on my TV , whenever I wish.
I wish this type of collection existed for other Tv programs like Barndance and the Gene Autry ranch show . A great buy, I almost ordered specific discs but the impact and breadth of this collection makes it a ""must Have "" , one disc would leave you unsatisfied .",1371254400,,733,4.343065693430657

performances, and that says it all, in my opinion!",1325462400,2,422,4.397435897435898
3273304,4,B000Z8H1YA,"This DVD contains video clips from several venues, and of numerous great players. I purchased this video set by mistake, thinking it was the Larry Black produced series. I will say, that this set is period correct, in that the stars were filmed singing their hits, at the time the hits were big.

I personally miss the camaraderie that is more evident on the Countrys Family Reunion set, but do not take it wrong~this is a true representation of the hitmakers of the day, and their most famous songs, performed by the hitmakers themselves.

But, as I stated, the CFR is just more preferable and entertaining in my opinion.",1310601600,10,622,4.697247706422019

Although, it should be noted that not all videos are from the Opry, some are from That Nashville Music & The Bobby Lord Show.  It doesn't matter though this collection has everything you can expect from Roy Acuff, Grandpa Jones to Loretta Lynn & Tammy Wynette.  I remember seeing some of these shows during the 60's.  Funny how the clothing style has changed but not the great sound of the music.  If you should decide to purchase you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.",1307923200,2,512,4.582417582417582
