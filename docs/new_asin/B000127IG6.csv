1967277,5,B000127IG6,"I am a new mom and my husband is a new dad. We found this video extremely helpful. We were both the youngest in our families and we waited a long time to have a kid. This opened our eyes to our baby on how he thinks, feel, and moves. I think this is amazing for a new parent who maybe isn't so sure on what to do.",1172361600,3,313,3.6176470588235294
1967278,5,B000127IG6,"This DVD possesses some of the best editing and production that I have yet to see in a child development product.

Each of the sections (cognitive, physical, and language) is well researched.  It's easy to understand and highly accessible.

Just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development.",1159401600,12,311,4.9423076923076925
1967279,5,B000127IG6,"This series of ""to walk,"" ""to think,"" and ""to talk"" is a great resource for child/human development.  It portrays current research in a brief yet engaging manner.  I use it in my Human Development course and students consistently find it helpful, informative, and interesting in demonstrating concepts and research that we're covering.  The second series of ""to feel,"" ""to belong,"" and ""to relate"" is also a great one.",1152662400,16,418,5.117647058823529
1967280,5,B000127IG6,"My profession is in Child Development, particularly autism, and I have been searching for many years for an effective teaching tool for parents and students that is enjoyable and informative at the same time. I have even tried rather unsuccessfully to video typically developing infants and children myself to use as tools. Nothing can even remotely compare with this series of documentaries: ""To Walk"", ""To Talk"" and ""To Think"". I cannot wait for the release of The Baby Human II which includes ""To Relate"" and ""To Belong"".

Not only a great teaching tool, but a WONDERFUL baby shower gift!

1967281,5,B000127IG6,I saw part of this series on cable and had to see more. Unfortunately they haven't come out with the full series on DVD yet - I think this is the only one available. It's extremely interesting viewing and shows a lot of research done with infants as support. I haven't seen any other programs like it.,1140393600,7,301,4.298245614035087
1967282,5,B000127IG6,"This was very well done.  The DVD presents various topics like movement, speech, perception related to infant development.  They include clips from some very interesting research studies.  The DVD is very fun to watch.  The true highlight of the DVD is the many many babies!!!  Will give you some insight into infant development.

Truly, even if you are infant specialist and know everything there is to know about infants and toddlers, this DVD is worth it - lots and lots of cute babies in action :)",1139443200,4,501,4.767441860465116
1967283,5,B000127IG6,"True, this isn't a series for parents looking for advice (as one of the previous reviewers critiqued), but this is MY FAVORITE baby show and I am very glad that I can ditch my tapes now that it is out on DVD.  There are a great many more episodes than those listed on this single DVD-- let's hope that this disk is profitable enough so that they decide to sell them all!

The episodes present classic psyc. experiments of developmental perception that are simply facinating.  If you are taking an intro. to psycology course and all the dry textbook descriptions are putting you to sleep, get this DVD!  Actually looking at the sweet little guys go through the set-ups will help you remember the different cognitive stages.  They are just too cute! and it is neat to see what ""tricks"" you can play on your own little fellow.",1130112000,10,823,4.533783783783784
1967284,5,B000127IG6,"A wonderfully insightful program whether you have kids or WERE one, which I think covers just about everyone. You learn not only about babies and toddlers but also about yourself and how you developed. My only complaint is that there are not enough episodes available for purchase.",1114214400,8,281,5.0
1967285,4,B000127IG6,"This show is absolutely fascinating.  It is one of the most interesting and educational shows I've seen about childhood  development.  The show does a great job of showing various experiments being done at different universities around the country and then talking about the conclusions from the experiments.

The only reason I am not rating this a 5 is because they only included 3 episodes on this DVD.  I am pretty sure that there are more episodes in the series.  I'd love to see the whole series on DVD.",1104019200,26,508,4.715909090909091

1967307,3,B000127IG6,"NOT CAPTIONED! I really enjoy showing this video in my language development of children who are deaf or hard of hearing graduate class. However, I realized this video is not captioned, thus not accessible to my students who are deaf. Huge disappointment.",1410825600,,254,5.071428571428571
1967308,5,B000127IG6,I use this to teach young mothers about child development. It is entertaining and fascinating.,1407888000,,94,5.333333333333333

1967310,5,B000127IG6,"Excellent - any new parent, grandparent or person that is around babies would get a lot from this Visio - it was like 3 videos in one - excellent!,",1404432000,,147,4.103448275862069
1967311,4,B000127IG6,"This was a series on baby development that was very fascinating.  I sent copies of this to some friends when they just had babies, so they would understand the amazing potential of this little person in their home.

Lots to learn, and if you are interested in child development, you will enjoy this.",1395705600,,299,4.622641509433962
1967312,4,B000127IG6,"This is great for educated parents and professionals who are already dealing with very young children and find themselves staring at this little one and wondering what's going on in his or her head.  There's lots of footage of actual studies in the labs of some very creative psychologists who specialize in the infancy and toddler years (3 months to 2 years), and it leaves a viewer marveling at how much these nonverbal little people already know, even when they can't tell us directly..  The kids are consistently cute and their abilities are amazing.  Not the DVD to choose for a future parent who's looking for a how-to intro to parenting, but a delightful choice for current parents (and grandparents) who want to know much more about the stunningly rapid development of the little ones they know.  I'd give it five stars except that it's sometimes a bit annoyingly over-dramatic and repetitive about the ""baby human"" label (which is superfluous anyway, since no other species appear), but I still recommend it strongly.",1389398400,,1026,4.9476744186046515
1967313,5,B000127IG6,"This is a fascinating summary of research conducted with infants.  If you are interested in current science regarding infant locomotion, cognition, and language you should find it useful.",1372723200,,187,5.678571428571429
1967314,4,B000127IG6,"It is, just as the second part, a pretty good tool for everyone who's interested in human development, specially children's and babies'. I only believe it'd be a great help if it also had subtitles for the hearing impaired or other languages, but it's a real jewel to have.",1360540800,,273,4.591836734693878
1967315,5,B000127IG6,"This was a real eye opener.  It included many studies being demonstrated with babies.  Not only was it entertaining, but also educational.  I highly recommend it for parents, grandparents, babysitters, anyone that is around babies.",1358208000,,231,5.542857142857143
1967316,5,B000127IG6,This is an excellent video for use in the classroom. It presents accurrate information about infant/toddler development in an authoritative but entertaining way. This video is a must for new parents and anyone wanting to know about child development.,1318204800,,250,5.435897435897436
1967317,5,B000127IG6,"Very interesting show. Very cool concepts. Case and packaging are eco-friendly, which is a plus in my book. I had no idea babies knew so much. The experiments are fun and you really do learn a lot about these interesting creatures. Shipping was fast with no damages to the case or the disc. I also purchased The Baby Human 2, which I also highly recommend.",1298937600,,356,4.492307692307692
1967318,4,B000127IG6,It really helps me see my baby from a different point of view - his. But I wish they had put some more material in it.,1285977600,,118,3.576923076923077
1967319,3,B000127IG6,"GOOD THINGS: this miniseries about the research and development of the baby's mind and physical motor skills not only fascinated me beyond belief just in watching the babies grow and the amazing things they scientifically prove to understand far before they can communicate it, but it was also a very important tool in understanding how to support my own baby's growth and development. I couldn't believe the way the research broke down the ""why""s of what babies do, instead of the same old materials telling us WHAT babies do. Not to mention, there were things that different babies did at different ages in this DVD that totally shocked and amazed me. i had no idea that babies knew as much as they do. because they can't assimilate the information into direct communication of what they know, we as adults might assume they're just cute cheeks and happy coos until a certain age. the way they process information about the world around them from birth and on is just simply amazing and i have already started to adapt some of the things i've seen the researchers do on this dvd into my own parenting practice.

REALLY ANNOYING THINGS:

1) SUPREME overuse of the term ""Baby Human""... there's another reviewer on here that rated the series 1 star because they were offended at the series rating us down with other species of animals. when i first read that guy's review i couldn't WAIT to respond to him and tell him that his review was the biggest load of crap i'd ever heard. however, in a way, i can see where he arrived at that conclusion. first of all, they never call a ""baby"" simply a ""baby"". they always refer to it as a ""Baby Human"" so much to the point that when you hear it every 3 seconds (the baby human learns to walk, the baby human hears her mother's voice, the baby human rests in her crib) it does get distracting. it's used in extreme excess. if you were to watch a documentary (even a scientific one) about dogs, it would be annoying to constantly hear ""the baby dog learns..."" or ""the puppy dog"" or ""the baby cat"" or ""the kitten cat learns to"" over and over again. we get that ""puppy"" means ""baby dog"" and ""kitten"" means ""baby cat"" the same way we can understand that in a documentary on THE HUMAN SPECIES, ""baby"" is in reference to a baby human. also, they tend to refer to us as a species through the whole dvd constantly. yes, we are a species. i REALIZE that's a correct scientific term. however, it's usually used when it's not even being compared to another species, so it's just random, as random as it is to keep saying ""baby human"" when it's not at all in direct comparison to any other species. i don't mean to go on and on about this, but about the 85th time in an hour when you hear the phrase, it not only sticks out as unnecessary, but it literally distracts you to the point htat you're wondering why they keep saying it and have to rewind because you missed what they just said.

2) most of the research proven in this series was, in fact, mind-boggling and amazing. however, they often showed two different babies in one area of growth and development. for instance: ""baby human mary is 4 months old as she watches as the ball is lowered into the glass. she makes no differentiating movements or reactions when the ball is then lowered into a cylindar that is clearly too narrow for the ball to go into. baby human kendra is 5 months old as she watches the same experiment. however, when the ball is lowered into the glass that it should not fit into, she is fascinated. her face displays her disbelief. so, the experiment proves that in the time difference of only one month, the baby human has started to grasp reality to the point that she knows when the reality around her is being defied or manipulated"" the problem with this kind of comparison is that baby human ""mary"" might still not know this in 2 months from now whereas baby human ""kendra"" might have known this since her second month of life. if they are testing several hundreds of different babies, they should make that clear, because they don't clearly state that the research is based on an average or a large number of charted growth development. to the watcher, every few experiments you are wishing that they would show the growth in the SAME baby to prove their theories. why they continuously show a comparison of development from two very different baby humans at not only different ages but different surroundings, parents, leadership, environments, and most of all, natural learning speeds inherited geneologically, is beyond me. i found this very irritating.

overall, i am VERY glad that i bought this dvd miniseries and the following BABY HUMAN 2, as they have successfully helped me learn more about my baby's development and learning.",1277337600,9,4753,4.588235294117647
1967320,3,B000127IG6,"We purchased this video thinking that it would offer some tips on what we as parents can do to help our child develop.  Rather, the video is a documentary on three/four aspects of child developement but not offing tips per say.  I would say this video is more like the next step for the In The Womb series (by National Geographic) rather than an instructional video.  All in all it was interesting but not what we were looking for.",1234137600,,431,4.430379746835443

1967322,5,B000127IG6,"I am a middle school child development teacher.  This is by far the best value of any video I have ever purchased.  You also get three shows in one dvd.  The quality of the video is typical of a Discovery channel special.
I have seen these shows about fifty times (and counting)and never get tired of them.  I very highly recommend this video.",1226102400,,343,4.396825396825397
1967323,1,B000127IG6,"The Baby Human was a gigantic disappointment only because of the irritating use of the term ""baby human"" in each reference to the child  (as opposed to baby gorilla, baby shark, etc.)  I teach developmental psychology and I know terms such as ""child,"" ""neonate,"" ""toddler,"" and ""baby"" are routinely used in textbooks, but I think the agenda behind this video was to diminish the dignity of the human life and equate it with any lower form of life.  The animal rights' folks will love this one.  This in-your-face propaganda did elicit some interesting and insightful student responses however, and I love to see students think critically, so it wasn't a total loss.  Factual content was good--but please' ' ' hold the agenda.",1217289600,,725,4.909836065573771
