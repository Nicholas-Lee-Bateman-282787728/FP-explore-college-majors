3994363,4,B002VECLXM,"One of the most respected and most successful Spanish filmmakers internationally is Pedro Almodovar.  Known for creating films with complex narratives, showcasing vibrant colors and are melodramas, the filmmaker created his most expensive and longest film in 2009 shot in Spain titled ""Los Abrazaos Rotos"" (Broken Embraces).

In ""Broken Embraces"", the film is about time lost and jealousy.  The film begins with the present as a man named ""Harry Caine"" (played by Lluis Homar), a blind writer who lives his life with his agent Judit (played  by Blanco Portillo) and her son Diego (played by Tamar Novas).

But life chances for Harry when he finds out that the wealthy millionaire named Ernesto Martel (played by Jose Luis Gomez) has died.

The story then shows us a flashback to 1994.  Lena (played by Penelope Cruz) works for Ernesto Martel but one day, she is called by her mother about her sick father who was supposed to undergo surgery but since the doctor planned to go on vacation, with no backup doctor in sight, Lena's father was good as dead.

Knowing the money and power of Ernesto, she asks for his help and he gives it to her.  And from that point, Ernesto and Lena become a couple.  But Lena has always dreamed of becoming an actress and for Ernesto, what best than to produce a film with one of the best Spanish directors out there.... Mateo Blanco (who at the time has great eyesight).

Filming goes well but immediately, both Lena and Mateo have this sexual attraction that leads the two to have a passionate tryst.  What they don't know is that their relationship is under the close eye of Ernesto's videographer son aka ""Ray X"" who films the two and the video is then read by a mouth reader and translated to Ernesto.  Ernesto learns that the woman he loves is having sexual liasons with his director and he is not too thrilled about it.

Lena is so in love with Mateo and cant' stand having sex with the older Ernesto that she is through with the relationship but Ernesto is not going to let her go.

The film is eventually completed but in this course of time, somehow Lena ends up dead, Mateo ends up blind and long kept secrets are about to be revealed over 14 years later.

VIDEO:

""Broken Embraces"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  If there is one thing that cinema fans can expect from a Pedro Almodovar film, his films are gorgeous.  Working together with Director of Photography Rodrigo Prieto, the two managed to create an absolutely beautiful and vibrant film with beautiful images captured on the big screen.

From breathtaking shots and well done character placement in the scene, ""Broken Embraces"" is just a beautiful film to look at and once again, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has done a remarkable job in bring this film to Blu-ray.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep, great amount of detail from the freckles to age spots on the skin to the beautiful cinematography captured in this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Broken Embraces"" is presented in Spanish 5.1 DTS HD-MA and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  This melodrama is primarily front and center channel driven with its dialogue and the original score by Alberto Iglesias.  But there are moments where surround channels are used effectively from the slight ambiance of footsteps in a hospital scene, to hearing crowd ambiance at the beach or a restaurant.

Dialogue is clear and understandable.  Music sounds absolutely beautiful and for the most part, this lossless soundtrack is quite satisfactory for this type of film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Broken Embraces"" comes with the following special features in Standard and High Definition with English and Spanish Stereo and optional English subtitles:

  * Deleted Scenes - A total of three deleted scenes: Assembling the Notebook, Restaurant Without a View, Continuation of Girls and Suitcases
  * Pedro Directs Penelope - (5:52) Featuring a split screen of Pedro Almodivar directing the ""Girls and Suitcases"" scene for the film.
  * Variety Q&A with Penelope Cruz - (6:18) Variety's live public interview hosted by Variety's Todd McCarthy with Penelope Cruz.
  * ""The Cannibalistic Councillor"" Short Film by Pedro Almodivar - (7:33) The following short ""The Cannibalistic Councilor"" features the the characters of Penelope Cruz's Lena and the other female actress from the film that Mateo was shooting in the film.
  * On the Red Carpet: The New York Film Festival Closing Night - (3:13) A short featurette featuring the closing night and the talent arriving on the red carpet and how Pedro Almodivar's films have become a staple for the NYFF for many years.
  * Theatrical Trailer - (1:45) The original theatrical trailer for ""Broken Embraces"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Broken Embraces"" (Los abrazos rotos) is a dark melodrama that showcases Pedro Almodovar's beautiful filmmaking, Rodrigo Prieto's beautiful cinematography, Alberto Iglesias's emotional score and the powerful performances from the film's talent.  For the most part, I was very impressed with this film.

Penelope Cruz returns in a part where she plays a sexy woman in a relationship with an older man (which she did with Ben Kingsley in 2008's ""Elegy"") but for the most part, Cruz does a wonderful job portraying a character who is stuck in a relationship that she can't escape from and another wonderful pairing with Almodovar since their 2007 film ""Volver"" and 1999's ""All About My Mother"" (which is highly recommended film).

Actor Lluis Homar does a great job of feeding off Cruz's emotions as the two have a believable chemistry together onscreen.  Homar's transformation from the filmmaker Mateo Blanco to the blind writer Harry Caine was well-done.  But I also have to really give credit to Blanca Portillo as Judit Garcia who is a major key to the film.

But what makes ""Broken Embraces"" work so well is the balance of beautiful cinematography, character placement and just getting these beautiful key shots that looks rather artistic and boasting with vibrant colors and for the most part, Almodovar is just a brilliant filmmaker.  He knows what he wants to capture on camera and the overall presentation is well-done.

If there is any criticism, it's pretty much anyone's comparison of Almodovar's previous work because he has created his share of cinema masterpieces.  Some may feel that the film borrows from his 1988 film ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" but truthfully, I just felt intrigued by the film.  Sure, some parts may have been predictable but I felt that Almodivar tied the film up quite nicely.  And just loved the nod to several filmmakers and their films when Diego was looking for Louis Malle's ""Elevator to the Gallows"" for Mateo especially the ""Peeping Tom"" reference (for those familiar to Michael Powell's 1960 psychodrama).

The Blu-ray features beautiful, vibrant visuals and solid lossless soundtrack for this type of film and a good number of special features.

Overall, ""Broken Embraces"" is an enjoyable film.  It definitely has its share of dark moments but everything comes together quite harmonically for this film.  If you have never experienced a Pedro Almodovar film (especially on Blu-ray), definitely give ""Broken Embraces"" a try.

Definitely recommended!",1269302400,,7286,5.00665004156276
3994364,5,B002VECLXM,"Pedro Almodvar continues his unique reputation for making films that are in some ways outrageous, richly colorful, populated with his seemingly near private cadre of actors - all taking us into a world that requires us to piece together elements of his intense imagination and gift of communication.  BROKEN EMBRACES (LOS ABRAZOS ROTOS) is a fine example of how this gifted writer and director can take what appears to be a simple story and give it so many levels of penetrating meaning that we learn more about ourselves by just watching the film.

In many ways this most current art piece is a film within a film about a film that has been filmed!  It is a story about a film writer and director whose life is altered by the appearance of a key figure - a twisting and turning entanglement of plots that requires intense concentration to follow.  The time frames vary from 1992 to 2008 and the changes in the characters (the main character goes from a sighted man to a blind man) and Almodvar's method in unraveling this mystery and tale of love and death is cinematically magical.  Penlope Cruz is extraordinarily fine as Lena, the female crux of the conflicts, Llus Homar is the central writer director Mateo Blanco / Harry Caine, Blanca Portillo is the important but enigmatic Judit Garca,  Jos Luis Gmez plays the center of evil Ernesto Martel, and the rest of the cast is also filled with fine actors.  This film explores Almodvar's sense of the bizarre, of the fantastical color he sees in life, and yet also brings to life the tenderness and vulnerability of each of his characters as well as anyone writing for the screen today.  A fine film that deserves a much wider audience.  Grady Harp, March 10",1269129600,,1710,4.673333333333333
3994365,5,B002VECLXM,"Pedro Almodvar is flying high -- he is on a class of his own. Very few moviemakers have been able to consistently release film after film as well-crafted as this prodigious Spanish director. After his work finally became very visible in the United States since the heavily acclaimed ""Women on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown"" (1988), his movies just keep getting better and better. Happily, he can now add the brilliant and absorbing ""Broken Embraces"" (Los Abrazos Rotos) to his remarkable career.

Like almost any other Almodvar film, ""Broken Embraces"" takes time to build, slowly boiling down to a heavy climax. In this case, the story fluctuates between the nineties and 2008, when the movie begins. We meet Harry Caine (Llus Homar, whose face reminds me of Laurence Olivier), a successful script writer who happens to be blind. We also meet Judit (Blanca Portillo), his agent, as well as Diego (Tamar Novas), his personal assistant. One day, Harry learns about the death of Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez), a powerful businessman, with whom he previously had a connection -- they both loved the same woman (Penlope Cruz). With Martel's death, Harry has to reconcile with the past, before he became blind, and was known as Mateo Blanco, a successful film director. In doing so, he is in for more surprises, concluding that ""films have to be finished, even if you do it blindly.""

Almodvar has said that ""Broken Embraces"" is about love between four people. That may be the case, because love is the main determinant in everybody's lives in this story. However, there is also a great amount of intrigue and some moments of humor - Spanish style - that elevate the film above from the romance realm. Only Almodvar has that touch, and his movies are always welcome. The Blu-ray also includes deleted scenes; segments of Almodvar directing Penlope Cruz; ""The Cannibalistic Councillor,"" a short film by Almodvar; Q&A with Penlope Cruz; and more.

3994366,3,B002VECLXM,"In ""Broken Embraces"", Pedro Almodovar  rehashes a lot of themes and devices from his earlier films to create a pastiche that is pleasant enough but not as strong as his more daring and original works. Harry Caine (Lluis Homar) is a blind screenwriter who had been film director Mateo Blanco before he lost his sight. Now he dictates screenplays to his assistant  Diego (Tamar Novas), the son of his longtime manager Judit (Blanco Portillo), who wishes Harry would write scripts for more popular genres. One day as aspiring filmmaker (Ruben Ochandiano) proposes that Harry collaborate on a script about a son who avenges himself on his detested father posthumously. That inspires Harry to tell Diego the story of how he fell in love and lost his sight 14 years earlier, a subject of which he has not spoken in all those years.

In 1994, Harry met Lena (Penelope Cruz), the beautiful mistress of financier Ernesto Martel (Jose Luis Gomez), when he directed her in her first film, a comedy called ""Girls and Suitcases"". They fell in love and incurred Ernesto's wrath. The film shifts back and forth, between 1994 and 2008, as Diego takes in the story, and Judit grows wary of what Harry might tell him. Harry and Lena's affair is deliberately clichd, but I waited for Almodovar to give it his unique spin. Unfortunately, it never quite delivers. Lena seems more an object than a fully realized character, which might be fitting, as she is in Harry's memory. But as a main character, she is underwritten. Jose Luis Gomez is perfect as a man in the grip of obsession for Lena, so much so that I wish Ernesto had a more prominent role.

Sometimes Pedro Almodovar has a stroke of brilliance. And sometimes he seems to make movies because he likes making movies, even if he doesn't have anything fresh to contribute. I've seen too much of ""Broken Embraces"" in his other films, and it just never engages the audience. Harry and Lena's love has no spark. I could see the ""surprises"" coming a mile away. Some actions seem to lack motivation. Penelope Cruz is luminous. There's never any doubt as to why she's a movie star in Almodovar's films. Jose Luis Gomez is very good, and so Blanco Portillo would be if the writing for her character were a little better.  I think those familiar with Almodovar's work are going to find this one stale. But I can't really recommend it to those new to Almodovar, as you would be better off seeing the great ""All About My Mother"" (1999) or, if you want noir, the labyrinthine noir homage/spoof ""Bad Education"" (2004). In Spanish with optional subtitles.

The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features include 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2 min), and 4 featurettes. ""The Cannibalistic Councillor"" (7 min) is a scene from the fictional ""Girls and Suitcases"" movie, in which Chon, a woman of conservative politics and Councillor of Social Affairs, goes on about her sexual obsession and foot fetish. This is pure, hilarious Almodovar and not to be missed. There is another scene from the fictional movie among the deleted scenes. ""Pedro Directs Penelope"" (6 min, English subtitles) shows us what Almodovar is saying offscreen while two actresses play a scene. ""On the Red Carpet: The New York Film Festival Closing Night"" (3 min) has a few brief interviews. ""Variety Q&A with Penelope Cruz"" (6 min) is an interview of Cruz by Todd McCarthy.

3994367,4,B002VECLXM,"Broken Embraces (Los abrazos rotos) DVD Review
1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2009)

""Broken Embraces"" was a 2010 Golden Globe Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, written and directed by Pedro Almodvar. This story is about Mateo Blanco (Llus Homar) who used to be a film director and went under the alias Harry Caine as a screenwriter. Fourteen years ago, a car accident took his sight and the love of his life, Lena away from him. To distract his production manager's son after an accident, he tells the story of Lena (Penelope Cruz), how they met, and how they ended.

In the beginning, this movie jumps around a lot into the past and back to the present to show you where Mateo is now being a screenwriter only under the name Harry Caine and still managing to seduce women by luring them back to his place to read the paper for him. His manager, Judit (Blanca Portillo) and her son, Diego (Tamar Novas) take good care of him and keep unscrupulous people (like Lena's former lover's son) away from him. When Diego takes ill, Mateo admits his former name and tells the story of how Lena came to audition for him as an actress and their relationship from that point on. Llus Homar plays a younger, happier version of his character as a director and in love and then also has to play the older version of his character as a blind man and how the accident changed his personality to be more cynical and cut off emotionally from others around him. Particularly in his blind scenes, I felt Homar really hit his mark and performs exceptionally well with the difficulties of portraying a handicap physically and emotionally.

Lena's story begins with the difficult situation of being poor with a sick father and being willing to do anything to help him. This leads her to be under the thumb of an abusive older jealous man, Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez). Penelope Cruz really ends up playing three characters, the woman Lena is, the woman she has to pretend to be, and the role she plays as an actress in a movie being made within this film. In keeping all these identities straight, she does an admirable job. She's a beautiful woman and her character becomes the obsession of more than one man, one whom she loves and the other whom takes advantage of her physically whenever possible and has his son stalk her with a video camera. Cruz steals the movie with her appearance and demeanor, particularly in vulnerable situations.

The style of ""Girls and Suitcases"", the film Mateo is making is vibrant with colors that pop and light humor. Since you are watching a film being made, there are several takes that don't work because of Lena's emotional state. Besides watching this movie in a different language where it's a little more difficult to discern audible inflections, you have to figure out if the ""Girls and Suitcases"" scenes are hitting their comic notes or not. I found it difficult to judge the comedic success of Mateo's film on this level. It is much easier when Lena is being herself or the identity she shows as a mistress to connect with her emotional state. Lena is acting the majority of the time and has to be afraid of the consequences of showing her true feelings. The heart of the matter is her struggle to achieve the destiny she wants with the man she truly loves even though the audience knows she is doomed from the start.

A tragic love affair contrasted with a light comedy in storytelling mode to another character isn't easy to pull off and I felt the director really handled the load well changing up the moods with color, music, and guiding his actors through the levels. I recommend this for one viewing if you like to expand your horizons, but it probably won't be for everyone. It isn't the best foreign film I saw from 2009, but it definitely has its merits.

DVD Extras:

The deleted scenes mostly make sense for not being cut. One reminds me of ""When In Rome"" that I saw recently because it has the group of three going to a restaurant where they eat in the dark and it results in another character's emotional breakdown. Another scene though is from the movie the Mateo made that connects the last scene you see from his movie in this film to the short film also on this DVD, ""A Cannibalistic Councillor."" I'd recommend watching the deleted scenes first so you can go right into the short film. It's a bit of a showpiece for the comic actress opposite Penelope as she goes on a rampage eating in the kitchen and snorting cocaine and it's a very funny monologue...but it makes a lot more sense if you get to see what happens first in that cut scene.

There's a sequence were Pedro directs Penelope and I have to say, it is impressive for his ability to translate exactly what he wants as a director, but he doesn't give Penelope a lot of room for error or exploration because he directly gives her the subtext and line delivery on her takes. It seems very distracting! I guess he wants to surprise her into very honest takes that are exactly what he wants but it doesn't given her any extra creativity oddly enough.

There is a feature of Red Carpet footage from the New York Film Festival Closing Night and has some interview questions with Penelope Cruz and Pedro Almodvar. And lastly, a Variety questions and answers session with Penelope Cruz about working on this film that is insightful into the rehearsal process and her character development.

3994368,3,B002VECLXM,"""Broken Embraces"" (""Los abrazos rotos"") is the latest effort from Pedro Almodvar, one of today's most acclaimed film directors. However, though it has interesting and innovative ideas in terms of visual and narrative structure, as well as talented actors including Oscar winner Penlope Cruz, the film doesn't come close to being as impressive and involving as his previous films like ""All About My Mother"" and ""Talk to Her.""

Mateo Blanco (Llus Homar) is a blind screen writer working under the alias of ""Harry Caine. One day a young man ""Ray X"" (Rubn Ochandiano)"" visits him, with his original script about a father and a son. It is obviously a very personal story, personal to both ""Ray"" and ""Harry."" Cue to the romance fourteen years ago, when ""Harry"" was Mateo Blanco, a film director who falls deeply in love with Lena (Penlope Cruz), a mistress of a successful businessman Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez).

""Broken Embraces"" is basically a melodrama full of unique and unusual ideas - and this is nothing surprising in Almodvar's films - but as a whole the film itself is a bit shallow. In spite of the presence of Penlope Cruz and her strong performance, the character of Lena remains rather bland, buried under the various classic Hollywood stars-like images she and her fashion styles evoke.

Pedro Almodvar often employs unique narrative devices. One example here is the ""making-of"" film shot by Ernesto's son. When the videotaped soundless footage of Lena is shown before the possessive millionaire, he watches it with a lip reader reading every single word for him. When this is unique enough, Almodvar goes one step further. See it for yourself. You either find it brilliant or pretentious.

""Broken Embraces"" is the kind of art-house film that you know requires more than one viewing, with repeated motifs, a film-within-film, numerous references and ambiguous wordplays. Is it Harry Caine, or ""hurricane""? Or is it about James M. Cain? You follow the melodramatic story, you enjoy watching it and think get the point, but somehow you feel you might have missed out some details, somewhat dissatisfied. Whether or not the film is worth revisiting depends on you.",1266883200,2,2175,5.016620498614959
3994369,3,B002VECLXM,"Harry Caine (Lluis Homar) is a blind screenwriter leading a quiet life in 2008 Madrid who is brought back - rather against his will - to contemplating the events of 1994 that changed his life when one of the people intimately involved in them, a rich industrialist named Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez) has died.  He starts to open up to his young friend Diego (Tamar Novas), the son of his agent Judit (Blanca Portillo) about Magdalena (Penlope Cruz), first an employee of Martel and then his mistress, who came into his life as a would-be actress and ended up much more.  And through the telling, secrets involving Diego and his mother also come to light, tragedies and perhaps resolutions that had lain dormant for a decade and a half...

Although I don't have any truly enormous complaints about BROKEN EMBRACES, I don't have a whole lot that's really wonderful to say about it either.  This feels to me like Almodvar running on autopilot; all of the major themes of his past several films (haunting pasts, accidents and illnesses and disabilities, the life of the writer, the sacrifices women have to make) are in evidence here but there isn't much that's fresh or interesting in his handling of any of them, many of the revelations are telegraphed a mile away (if you can't figure out Diego's secret before the halfway point you probably haven't seen ten movies in your life), and the emotions seem muted and dry.  There's little of his earlier trademark panache or humor, and the film seems to move relentlessly towards a fairly predetermined ending which comes off as too easy and not necessarily believable or even deserved..

Cruz and Homar probably come off the best in the central roles, maybe because they have the closest things to real characters to play, though even they feel underdeveloped.  Gmez' Martel just seems like a possessive rich guy caricature, and none of the other characters register at all beyond the parts they play revolving around the central love triangle.  Blanca Portillo, fantastic in VOLVER, seems wasted here - I don't have any complaints about her acting, but her role seems underwritten and bland.  The director's use of color, even, strikes me as a little less impressive than usual and the film feels like it could have been set and shot just about anywhere, the feeling for place isn't all that strong.

I wasn't too too bored despite the 127 minutes that seemed like it could have easily been pared to 100 or less, so it wasn't a complete washout, and Penlope is as lovely as ever, so points there.  But not enough, when all is said and done. Easily my least-favorite Almodvar film so far; I don't mind that he keeps traveling the same roads of memory and loss -- many directors have made wonderful careers with less variation than he has typically offered in his recent work -- but I think this one just ended up a little too straight and narrow and the scenery just wasn't memorable enough.  If you're a fan, it's worth a watch I guess; if you're new to the director, I'd recommend any of his other films since the late 90s before this one",1266451200,8,3087,4.685767097966728
3994370,4,B002VECLXM,"Harry Caine is a blind screenwriter, watched over by his former production assistant, Judit, and her son, Diego.  His simple routine is upset when he hears of the death of a wealthy tycoon, and is later visited by the dead man's son in disguise.  Pressed by Diego to explain, Harry recounts the tragic tale of how he, then known as Mateo Blanco, had fallen in love and had an affair with the tycoon's former lover, when she played a role in a film he was then directing, and of the accident that left him blind.  The story itself is convoluted but clear enough - and I can't quite understand all the complaints about the story being confusing since film noir often tells a story within a story and keeps the audience guessing.  Things are resolved in the end, and nearly every loose strand is tied.  This one adds to the usual complexities a reflection on cinema, and two films within the film, and explores what it takes to revisit and remake the past so as to go on living.

It is a very poignant and at times quite amusing film about memory, lies, double lives, jealousy and revenge.  Beautifully filmed with the eye for vibrant color and beauty that Almodovar is known for, the film also serves as a reminder of the changes in film technology that have occurred over the past few decades, and of the changes that have taken place in Almodovar's own style as a filmmaker, given that the film within the film suggests the more melodramatic and stylized work of his past.  The film within a film bears a striking resemblance to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-on-the-Verge-of-a-Nervous-Breakdown/dp/B002M2T1V8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</a>, the film that placed Almodovar on the world stage as one of the most intriguing of auteurs.  Perhaps not among his greatest masterpieces - like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-About-My-Mother/dp/0767847105/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All About My Mother</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talk-to-Her-Hable-con-Ella/dp/B00005JLQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talk to Her (Hable con Ella)</a>, which are my personal favorites - but still a very entertaining and provocative new film by one of the greatest living filmmakers. Highly recommended.

Update: I just saw this again and was struck by Almodovar's mastery of conflicting moods in this film - nostalgia, melancholy, hilarity, rapture, tension and suspense.  Somehow it manages to be all of these without becoming muddled.  The film also manages to channel a wide range of associations with other films and filmmakers while remaining thoroughly in the grasp of Almodovar and his distinctive sensibilities.  On this second viewing I detected hints of Antonioni (especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Avventura/dp/B00005BHW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Avventura</a>), Hitchcock (especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/0783226055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>), Michael Powell (with an explicit reference to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peeping-Tom/dp/0780022629/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peeping Tom</a>), and, of course, of Almodovar's own earlier work.  A beautiful and intelligent film, that holds up on multiple viewings.",1264204800,34,3474,6.491341991341991
3994371,2,B002VECLXM,"Almodovar is a master filmmaker, which almost saves this rather self-indulgent piece. The acting is superb across the board, and the way he lenses Madrid and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking.

This makes it all the more unfortunate that the plot points do not connect and that integral aspects of the premise are too fantastic to be believable, which would not be a problem except that this is decidely a work of realism.

One of the major flaws of ""Broken Embraces"" is that it has no definite (or likeable) protagonist. Without this a film often fails to sustain momentum or the audience's investment, and such is the case here.

Worse yet is that the core of the film is told in the past tense, with Penelope Cruz's bombshell Lena confined to it. This could work if the story - a filmmaker's long lost love recounted - were inherently compelling, and in the beginning it is, especially due to Jose Luis Gomez's pitch-perfect portrayal of antagonist Ernesto Martel, a Donald Trump-like figure whose obsession with Lena fuels the film.

With too tenuous a grasp on key plot elements - the significance of both the blindness (or lack thereof) and alter ego of the tenuous protagonist, who goes either by Mateo Blanco or Harry Caine, the reasons behind the film's (fairly predictable) climax, the genetic history of several characters (one intended revelation toward the end of the film is easily assumed - taken for granted, even) - and a total lack of believability of the motivations of Judit, played by the luminous Blanca Portillo, nearly surmounting her clumsy material, makes the film fail to weave securely its many ragged threads. It inevitably trips over its own muddied feet. It's like a lover masquerading seductively in lingerie and then making a mad dash out the door.

The promises the film makes in the beginning are left unfulfilled, and so too is the viewer. Those who relish the presence of Cruz, whose presence bears more than a little resemblance to Monroe, and fine acting from a capable ensemble will find something praiseworthy in ""Broken Embraces."" Still, one viewing will be quite sufficient.",1262217600,14,2127,4.930167597765363

3994374,3,B002VECLXM,"For six films Pedro Almodvar was at the very peak of his powers. Starting with the radically different career-altering straight melodrama of The Flower of My Secret (1995) and moving through the explosive sexuality of Live Flesh (1997), the balanced perfection of All About My Mother (1999), the metaphysical depth of Talk to Her (2002), the extraordinary narrative gymnastics of Bad Education (2004), and the deeply moving return to the social concerns of women surviving patriarchy in Volver (2006), Almodvar laid claim to being one of the very greatest (some say THE greatest) directors in contemporary cinema. Broken Embraces (Los abrazos rotos, 2009 ) is perhaps the inevitable reality check which illustrates the central truism that even great directors sometimes make bad films. The fact that his next two works (The Skin I Live In [2011] and Im So Excited! [2013]) also fail to measure up shows Almodvar to be stuck in a career rut. His films still make money (Im So Excited! is amazingly his second most profitable film after All About My Mother) and we shouldnt over-state this sense of crisis just yet, but it remains to be seen if he can regain his artistic mojo with the up-coming Julietta. My gut tells me his best films are now behind him and we will look back on the period (1995-2006) in the same way we look back at what Ingmar Bergman did in the 60s. Lets hope Almodvar has an Autumn Sonata (1978) or a Fanny and Alexander (1982) still left to give us.

Before I go on to review an Almodvar film I would usually attempt to contextualize what he does by outlining his position as a Spanish La Movida Madilea artist commenting on post-Franco society and his preoccupation with attack (on Francoism) and celebration (of democratic freedoms) with his themes of transition and identity search playing out in three areas  in politics, in the body and in the creative artistic process. Such a contextualization seems pointless though with Broken Embraces, a film which lacks such deep resonances. It is centrally concerned with the creative artistic process, but in a non-systematic way and at the expense of everything else. As with The Law of Desire (1987) and Bad Education the main character is a film writer/director doppelgnger for Almodvar himself, but the focus is heavily self-indulgent and the film refuses to take off and connect with anything audiences can really latch onto and be moved by, either intellectually or emotionally. There is so much brilliance on display  the acting, the stunning photography, the top dollar production values, but the script jumps around so wildly with over-intricate complexity stopping us from really connecting with anything of substance. Bad Education is if anything even more fractured and complex but its highly charged sexuality, its political resonance, its impressive Chinese box narrative construction, and its autobiographical flourishes all provide the vibrant glue which brings the elements together spectacularly well. Such glue is absent here, the various elements of the film just failing to gel. The only autobiography we see comes from Almodvars own filmography (especially the circumstances surrounding the making of Dark Habits [1984] and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown [1988]) and the failure to expand out from that makes the film curiously akin to navel-gazing. What follows contains spoilers.

Like Bad Education the action of Broken Embraces plays out in three time frames, 2008, 1992 and 1994. In 2008 Harry Caine (Llus Homar) is a blind film writer-director working in Madrid with his agent Judit (Blanca Portillo) and her son Diego (Tamar Novas). Recuperating from a near-fatal accident with drugs while his mother is away, Diego asks Caine to tell him about the past and especially why his secretive mother is scared of the son of a rich recently deceased financier Ernesto Martel (Jos Luis Gmez) now calling himself Ray X (Rubn Ochandiano). In 1992 we see how the aging Martel hooked his beautiful young secretary Lena (Penlope Cruz). He buys her (she is also a part time prostitute working for Madame Mylene [Kiti Mnver]) by paying for her fathers cancer treatment. In 1994 Lena is now Martels live-in mistress ambitious to be an actress. She auditions for Mateo Blanco, an established film director who later becomes Harry Caine. Financed by Martel, the film is titled Girls and Suitcases (a clear spoof on Women on the Verge) and during the shoot Lena and Mateo conduct an affair under the meddling eye of Martels son officially employed to do a making of documentary, but actually there to spy on Mateo and Lena for his father. Intensely jealous, Martel finds out about the affair and physically abuses Lena. Mateo takes Lena for a month to Lanzarote, checking in to their hotel as Harry Caine. Meanwhile Martel sabotages the editing of Girls and Suitcases, having the film made from the worst takes to destroy the careers of both Mateo and Lena. Returning to Madrid with Lena, a car wreck results in her death and his blindness. Judit comes and finds Mateo is now Harry Caine for good. Back in 2008 Judit decides to tell the truth about what really happened to Girls and Suitcases  that she allowed Martel to make the ruinous changes and she told him Mateo and Lena had gone to Lanzarote. She also tells Diego that Mateo is his father. Mateo is about to blackmail Ray X for destroying the unused footage of Girls and Suitcases when Judit tells him she has kept it all having disobeyed Martels destruction order. The film finishes with Mateo re-cutting his film at the editing table alongside Judit and their son.

Broken Embraces is centrally concerned with the fragility of vision and how impossible it is to control what we see. The films narrative spins around the key event of the car crash which kills Lena and blinds Mateo. The blindness is both emotional (the loss of his love) and physical (the loss of his eyes). This is paralleled in the script with Martel meddling with his artistic vision as captured on celluloid as he re-cuts the film in Mateos absence. Even after something is photographed, the vision remains open to manipulation. It is on this register that Broken Embraces is at its most honest and effective, rooted as it is in Almodvars own experience of having a producer meddle with his work after finishing it. In interview he explains, Years ago, on one of my films, the producer arrived with 18 details to be retouched in editing. I refused and he said I could burn the material. I threatened him because the law was on our side, and I was vehement. I resisted for months, waiting for the situation to end, until the distributer came to demand the film and it had to be released as it was. And it was a success. The film was Dark Habits and the producer Herv Hachuel had also stipulated that Almodvar feature his girlfriend Cristina Snchez Pascual, even though the director wasn't happy with her and had to change the script substantially because of limitations as he saw it in her acting. To this day Almodvar still distances himself from the film, the experience of making it rankling within him and ending up here in Broken Embraces. The rescue of Girls and Suitcases is paralleled with Mateo surging back to life together with the discovery of his new-found family. The last shot is strongly suggestive of the three of them bonding as a family unit after years of all suffering different kinds of impaired vision  guilt for Judit at having co-operated with Martel, confusion for Diego over his paternal roots and mysterious behavior of his mother, and creative oblivion for the director robbed of sight who finally sees that all films must be completed, even blindly.

The difficult of controlling ones creative vision is also clearly laid out in the whole 1994 segment of the film which deals with the making of Girls and Suitcases. The film is obviously based on Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown with the terrorist changed to a cocaine dealer and lays out the essential battle that takes place on many films between director and producer, and how impossible it is for the director to see without making compromises, without being blinded by the producer and the commercial imperatives he carries with him. Not only does Martel make it impossible for Lena to concentrate on acting, but he pushes her down stairs breaking her leg in the process which necessitates script re-writes. He also makes his presence felt through his son Ernesto Jr. (Ray X) pointing his camera at everyone, getting in the way by making his documentary so that daddy can see what Lena and Mateo are doing. The footage shot by him is presented as a film within a film by Almodvar which acts as a constant irritation which plagues the production. This is an extension of Victoria Abrils Scarface reality TV show presenter in Kika (1992) and continues the directors attack on the Tube. The producers interference continues right into the cutting room and the director is only left free once he has died, and even then it is only because a loyal friend (Judit) has disobeyed the order to destroy all the original material. Almodvar was once linked with going to Hollywood to direct Brokeback Mountain, but at the time he turned it down saying he would never be allowed to make the film as he would want to make it. Elsewhere he has described Hollywood films as producers cinema so I guess we cant expect an American film from him any time in the future

The restless way the film flits around (especially between 2008 and 1994) suites the central theme of the difficulty of seeing concretely and the effect is muddled even further by the relentless quotes and references to others films and directors who are clearly of great importance to Mateo/Almodvar. When Mateo is feeling down he wants to hear the voice of Jeanne Moreau (in Lift to the Scaffold [1957, Louis Malle]) and when Ernesto Jr. plagues Lena with his camera mounted on a tripod Peeping Tom (1960, Michael Powell) is cited. As Diego sorts through DVDs on Mateos shelf we hear the names of Nicholas Ray, Jules Dassin, Fritz Lang, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and films such as 8  (1963, Fellini) and Fanny and Alexander (1982, Bergman). Watch the walls of Mateos home and studio and we can see posters of The Big Heat (1953, Lang) and Gun Crazy (1950, Joseph H. Lewis) among others. Most of these references don't mean anything except to tell us what Mateo /Almodvar value and the yardstick by which they measure themselves. The most meaningful quote (in the sense that we see Mateo and Lena watch a clip on TV) is to Voyage in Italy (1953, Roberto Rossellini). The way this is done underlines a great fault in this film as clearly the film isn't as bedded within the narrative structure as All About Eve (1951, Joseph. L. Mankiewicz) is in All About My Mother or Bellissima (1951, Luchino Visconti) is in Volver. The clip we see is the famous one of Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders at Pompeii seeing a plaster cast of a couple in a locked embrace just as they had been 2,000 years ago at the very moment the lava from Vesuvius drowned them. The Bergman character realizes the cold embrace represents her own cold marriage and turns away in tears. Almodvar clearly means to draw a parallel between the couple we see and the cold relationship Lena is locked into with Martel which Mateo is rescuing her from. Dig deeper though and we find the reference is wrong. In the Rossellini film the point is that both frozen couples had once been in love and that the realization that a living marriage has become so cold leads to a miraculous epiphany where they re-discover each other. This has nothing to do with Broken Embraces in which Lenas relationship with Martel has never been romantic at all and there is no epiphany. The reference may appeal to Almodvar as he is very eager to cite a film held up by the French New Wave as an important one in the history of cinematic modernism, but it lacks resonance of any kind for the story at hand beyond the surface reaction of Lena to cold marriage.

Almodvar is usually so good at bedding his references within the fabric of his films and pretension is not a word I would usually use for him, but clearly in Broken Embraces there is something wrong with the relationships between the characters. All the fractured intensity of temporal jumping around, flashy film-referencing and cerebral meditation on seeing pushes simple human relationships off the screen. The film is clearly meant to be a romance with Penlope Cruz putting in what seems to be a wonderful performance as a tragic beauty used and abused by the predatory Martel, but who gets a brief respite from her suffering with her relationship with Mateo. Sadly, Almodvar never allows us to feel her emotions, her stress or her desperation. Indeed the lack of any romantic clinching scene between Lena and Mateo tells us that perhaps this director is temperamentally unsuited to romance. There is plenty of sex in all 19 Almodvar films, but preciously little romance. Take the brief sequence here where Mateo takes Lena to Lanzarote. To a wonderful Miguel Poveda love song on the soundtrack the island is introduced by a loving helicopter shot which shows off the spectacular black sand beaches to perfection. Lena and Mateo are shown together. Lena often has her arms around him, but he always has his back turned to her, preoccupied with taking photographs  of the sculpture on the road, of the beach. One scene has him photographing a landscape as Lena hugs him from behind. Is this guy so disinterested in his partner? Or is he really just a picture-taking monster, a machine to equal Ernesto Jr.? Even the would-be romantic clinch of the couple watching Voyage in Italy is accompanied by the taking of a self-timer-delayed photograph of the two of them. Perversely, Almodvar refuses to let romance ever settle and we never sense Mateo is saddened by her death either, something which proves disastrous for Cruz whose wonderful performance goes completely for nothing in a film too busy depicting Mateos problems of seeing within his own art to bother about his relationship with her. Another outstanding performance to suffer is Blanca Portillos Judit. Barely on screen for the first two thirds of the film, we are given fleeting hints that she had been in a relationship with Mateo long ago and that she is hiding something, but suddenly without warning shes given a grandstand restaurant scene in which she reveals how she cooperated with Martel to destroy Girls and Suitcases. In itself the scene is grippingly played, but we are left wondering why we couldn't have seen more of her in the film and the sudden shift of focus from Mateo to her sits very uneasily indeed. The film being firmly centered on Mateo surely it would have made better sense to feature his reaction to her words rather than focus so deeply on her face in one spectacular scene which seems to have strayed in from another film entirely. The following mornings revelation to Diego that Mateo is her father is also mismanaged. Without any build-up, our reaction is simply, So what? Like Cruz, Portillo is a marvelous actress, but again her performance has been sabotaged by a director too busy focusing on his own creative process to worry about letting his characters breathe believably. Almodvar is usually such an accomplished actor-director that it comes as a surprise that he could get the balance so wrong in this film. So much more could have been achieved with so much less self-reflexivity.

Lovers of Almodvar will want to see this film. It does bare tall the hallmarks of a typical film coming from him  the lush Rodrigo Prieto primary color photography, Antxn Gmezs chic production designs (check out Martels sumptuous home!) and the appearance of many of the usual actors (Rossy De Palma, Lola Dueas, Chus Lampreave, ngela Molina, Mariola Fuentes, Carmen Machi, etc) are all eye-catching. Lovers of Women on the Verge will also relish re-visiting old territory. It is perhaps useful to see a less successful Almodvar if only to appreciate the other films which are so much better. Bad Education and The Law of Desire are also centrally about the artistic process, but they never for one moment ever forget about the character relationships central to the story, everything bedded within a rich texture which eludes the director here.",1457395200,,16406,4.840042750267189

3994391,5,B002VECLXM,"I enjoyed this film tremendously.  It has many delights for one who loves film and studies film technique. The camera work is creative without appearing self-consciously strange.  The story is very well-structured. The principal actors play very well, and so do many of the supporting cast.  Nathan Anderson's review mentioned some of the allusions - tributes to other directors.  I didn't see the hints of Vertigo, but noted many other traces of the master of suspense.  The camera-carrying son had a strange look that might have suggested Psycho?  Scenes of cars along a mountain road were reminiscent of scenes from ""To Catch a Thief.""  The director in the film requested ""Elevator to the Gallows"" by Malle, and I consider that the best Hitchcock take-off made by the French New Wave.  On the shelf from which that film case was taken were several classics, including ""Orpheus"" by Cocteau.  The presence of potentially threatening staircases and falls evokes several of Hitchcock's films.  A woman in a wheelchair faintly evoked ""Rear Window.""  There was a shot with feet walking, with an original touch, which must have paid tribute to the well-known and often emulated opening sequence of ""Strangers on a Train"" - without a touch of cornyness. Nathan Anderson mentioned Antonioni, and I thought of ""Blow-Up"" at several moments during this film.  Anderson mentioned ""Peeping Tom"" and the compulsive camera-carrying son might relate to that film - or perhaps to the camera-obsessed neighbor in the more recent ""American Beauty."" Yet another: Cruz is made up to resemble Audrey Hepburn for the film-within-the-film ""Women and Suitcases,"" and her hairstyle resembles Hepburn's in ""The Children's Hour."" The Blu-ray has an extra of Almodovar directing Cruz which is rather interesting.  It must have been an early rehearsal, and he provided so much direction that some actresses would have fought his interference - but the way he described inner thoughts that did not appear in the dialogue was quite funny.  So it was actually a good way to direct Cruz's reactions.  DVDs permit us to see more than is visible at normal film speed.  I found some interesting things occurring in the background in some of the shots in this film.  This is the third Almodovar film that I have really loved, after ""Talk to Her"" and ""Volver,"" and I consider it better than either of those.",1393891200,,2370,5.035897435897436

3994403,3,B002VECLXM,"In parts, I really enjoyed `Broken Embraces', but as a whole it felt very underwhelming.  The characters are there, but they aren't completely woven into the fabric of the film, and the ending in particular seemed sloppily put together and underwritten.  Some of the character integration felt `off' from the primary focus of the film and so it took away from the end result.  It leaves you waiting for a resolve that it appears was never truly intended.

`Broken Embraces' tells the story of a screenwriter named Mateo Blanco who falls in love with the mistress of a very jealous and ultimately dangerous man; Ernesto Martel.  Ernesto is a stockbroker who takes the luminescent Lena as his mistress when she finds herself in desperate need of money.  Ernesto cares for her concerns and, in return, she gives herself to him.  Lena's dream is to one day become an actress, and so when she hears of an audition for one of Mateo's pictures, she takes a leap of faith that winds up in her favor, since Mateo is instantly smitten by her endearing charm and undeniable good looks.  Despite Ernesto's concerns, Lena takes the part and soon she falls into a passionate affair with Mateo.

The affair ends badly, and as a result Mateo loses the girl and his sight and his name; going by the name Harry Caine instead.

Pedro Almodovar is not a director I am entirely familiar with.  I think I've seen four of his films, and three of them have been made post-2000.  So, with that in mind, I am not really familiar with his overall style.  It is apparent from what I have seen (outside of `Talk to Her') that he embraces the soap operatic aspects of his culture and infiltrates that into his work.  I guess there is a tad of that in `Talk to Her' as well, but it is certainly tamed down.  In `Broken Embraces', that stylistic approach is a hindrance.  I loved the layers of soapiness in `Volver', for it felt so in tune with the flow of the film.  Here, the opening act (especially the scenes involving Lena and Ernesto's initial `affair') seems somewhat disjointed and uneven.  It doesn't help that some actors in the film, namely Ruben Ochandiano (who plays Ernesto's bitter son), seem to be starring in a different film altogether.  Sadly, it isn't just the tone of the film that seems underworked.  The story itself has nice flourished of complexities and mysteries (the throwback to the great noirs of the past is obvious here) but certain layers of the film are underwritten and in turn take away from the film's impact.  Especially when concerning the development of Ernesto's son, who pops back into Mateo's life with a strange request.  He goes from intriguing character to mere plot device; a prop of sorts who basically serves as a way to propel other aspects of the film forward.  The ending is also unfulfilling.  It just seems like a cheap way to close the film, and it doesn't really make a lot of sense when you think about it (Judit confessing to what she has kept all those years makes NO SENSE WHATSOEVER when she was fully aware of Mateo's feelings on the film in question).  It just felt like a lazy way to `tie up loose ends' without really having to tie them up.

It's an odd feeling, considering that the final lines in the film deal with the importance of `finishing' a picture.

`Broken Embraces' doesn't seem finished.

But, amidst all the negative is some serious positives in the vein of the performances found in this film.  Nearly everyone outside of the aforementioned Ruben Ochandiano is very good here.  Penelope Cruz is luminescent and perfectly mysterious in her delivery; attracting us with her allure and holding us in her presence by her commanding air of intrigue.  She also nails the emotional complexities (the disgust, the lust, the self-pity, the frustrations) with ease.  Jose Luis Gomez is brilliantly diabolical as Ernesto.  I love that he is ruthless and harsh and yet it finds a way to find some sympathy for this pathetic man trying desperately to hold onto the woman he adores.  He layers the creepy with the sympathetic well.  Lluis Homar has some great moments as Mateo, finding depth in his characters memories.  For me, the standout was Blanca Portillo.  She has such a quiet intensity; her eyes burning through the screen as she pines for a man who doesn't return her affections and she tortures herself over immature decisions.

It's a stunning performance.

While I have my issues with the film's overall tone, I do love some of the directorial decisions made by Pedro.  He knows how to build a scene and he understands how to frame his films so that they make the desired impact.  The love scenes in particular really color the story well; using tricks to create an emotion within the scene (the `blind' anonymous humping on the couch; the chaotic filming of the rapturous start to the `affair'; the suffocating sensations under the sheets).  It's just one (or three) examples of Almodovar's ability to weave sequences with subtle manipulations.

In the end I don't `highly' recommend this one, but it is worth seeing.  Pedro can tell a story well, even if that story isn't completely `there'.",1313971200,4,5140,4.7141255605381165

This is a great mystery, with loads of suspense. The time frames are a little hard to follow at first, but all settles in after about the first half-hour. It all makes sense, and it's worth it. Excellent support from Blanca Portillo, Jos Luis Gomez, and drop-dead handsome Tamar Novas, all perfectly cast. I've read some of the other reviews, and it's apparent that I liked it a lot more than many others; it totally worked for me, and my admiration of Almodovar is intact.

Pedro Almodovar's latest, ""Broken Embraces,"" is like a high-class telenovela for the art-house crowd.

Its love triangle - involving a film director (Lluis Homar), his gorgeous lead actress (Penelope Cruz) and her elderly, abusive boyfriend (Jose Luis Gomez) who's financing the film on which they're working - spans the period from 1994 to 2008.  In the present time, the financier, Ernesto Martel, has just died, while the director, Mateo Blanco, who has since become blind, has plans for writing another film.  But what's become of Lena, the girl of both of their dreams, in the intervening years?

Structurally, the movie divides its focus fairly evenly between the two time periods.  The intricately plotted narrative unravels like a conventional mystery story, with clues being dropped in at key moments and character connections and motivations becoming ever more clearly defined as the movie goes on.

This isn't prime Almodovar, by any means, but the customary florid melodrama, color-rich palette and elegant direction make it a worthy addition to the director's oeuvre.",1290038400,,1088,5.364705882352941

Of course, any pairing between Almodvar and Penlope Cruz is bound to be magic.  It's no different here.

3994410,2,B002VECLXM,"It is not possible to be more radiant, sympathetic, sultry, or vulnerable than Penelope Cruz manages in this movie.  The scenes with her stuck in the relationship with her millionaire lover are astonishing.  Two scenes are must-sees.  One involves a lip-reader, a secret video camera, a distraught lover, and a defiant ex-lover.  The other is just two flashes: her angry lover at the top of the stairs, and her reaction when being picked up from the bottom.  They are transcendent, and they will stay with me.

But the rest of the film is, shockingly, crap.  The lead actor is unsympathetic, totally uninteresting, and, worst crime of all, dull.  If we are supposed to feel drawn to a passionate-lovers-trapped-in-an-impossible-situation plot, Almodovar has to give us someone more compelling than this lunk.  There was zero chemistry between them, which is so shocking considering the actress involved I leave you to ponder the magnitude of this mistake.

The frame story is lengthy beyond endurance, trite, unoriginal, and convoluted to no good effect.  The discrepancy between the merit of the two stories is a real puzzle.  When we're with Cruz's character and her millionaire lover, we feel, happily, that we are in the hands of a master filmmaker.  But when we're taken to the frame story, it's as if we got transported to a Film 101 class senior project.  See the great scenes, and forget the rest.",1285804800,2,1405,4.9742489270386265
3994411,5,B002VECLXM,"Yet another absorbing human drama from Pedro Almadovar, surely the most interesting filmmaker working today. It begins as we meet the protagonist, a blind writer who has abandoned his true name and goes by the pseudonym Harry Caine. Gradually we learn through his web of complex relationships how he lost his sight and his soul.

We flash back to the 1980s. Harry is directing a comedy -- and his female lead, Lena, played by Cruz, is the mistress of an elderly but extremely rich and extremely possessive industrialist. Of course, Harry and Lena fall in love. We also meet other key characters -- Harry's agent who is in love with him, her son who helps look after him and the industrialist's son who is plain weird and creepy.

This movie unfolds like a thriller. The landscapes, especially the stark, volcanic terrain of the Canary Isles where the climax takes place, add immensely to the experience. There are some unforgettable images -- one that I can't get out of my mind is a close-up of Harry's two hands outlined against a projection screen. On the screen is a fuzzy image of him kissing Lena -- but of course he can't see it because he's blind.

Cruz gives yet another wonderful performance. She is of course strikingly beautiful but she's not afraid to be photographed looking haggard and bereft. She's also not afraid to bare her body to advance the plot or our understanding of her love for Harry.

In the end, the movie is about redemption -- about how people suffer incredible tragedy but find ways to carry on with the support of those who love them; about how souls can heal eventually although the hurt always remains.",1285113600,4,1637,4.693379790940766
3994412,5,B002VECLXM,"""Broken Embraces"" marks Almodovar's first self homage, moving from the overwrought melodramas of Douglas Sirk to the equally over-the-top telenovella style of ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"", quoted here as a film within a film. Starring Penelope Cruz, the director's resident muse, in a performance of dazzling physical beauty and deeply wrought emotionalism, Almodovar's film visually links her to both Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe, in the process making the case for Cruz as one of this point in film history's reigning icons.
Beginning with the positioning of a blinded filmmaker as his main character, Almodovar explores the themes of filmmaking, betrayal and parent/child relationships with vigor and imagination. After shout-outs to both Bunuel and Hitchcock, ""Embraces"" concludes with a son serving as his blinded father's eyes and father, mother and son working together to redeem both a family and a film. This is a filmmaker's and a film viewer's dream vision.",1283904000,4,988,5.380645161290323
3994413,3,B002VECLXM,"*** This review contains spoilers ***

For me, an Almodovar film is always a mixed bag. Broken Embraces is no exception. On the plus side, you have the consistently excellent dialogue that always features interesting information. For example, at the beginning of the film, Harry Caine (formerly Mateo) with his agent and former lover, Judit, discuss adapting a true-life story about playwright Arthur Miller, who placed his mentally handicapped child in an institution. There's another scene where Harry and Diego come up with a clever idea for a new screenplay--a group of vampires who work at a blood bank. The whole idea is very creative but it goes on too long (like so many other aspects of Almodovar's scenes); and when the two add in all the sexual jokes, I just wondered, is all this necessary?

Some internet posters felt that Diego's accidental overdose was an unnecessary scene which added little to the overall plot. It did go on a bit too long but obviously served as a device to introduce the series of flashbacks which Harry relates to Diego as he tells the story of his affair with Lena. For awhile, Almodovar emulates Hitchcock, and it appears that Broken Embraces is headed for neo-noir territory. Almodovar introduces us to the enigmatic Ray X, Ernesto Martel's insecure gay son, who trails Lena and Mateo around with his camcorder while they conduct their furtive affair during the filming of Mateo's new comedy 'Chicas y Maletas'. And then there's another unique character, Lola, the lip reader who Ernesto hires to try and deduce what Lena and Mateo are up to.

Despite the unique setup and characters, Almodovar is unable to sustain the suspense which we would expect from a film which is modeled on Hitchcock. In a scene straight out of the 1945 tear-jerker, Leaver Her to Heaven, Martel, consumed with jealousy, (and channeling Gene Tierney), pushes Lena down the stairs. The film virtually grinds to a halt after Lena and Mateo decide to flee from Madrid and Lena takes a job at a tourist hotel. Almodovar does answer one of the central questions of the film--how did Harry end up going blind? I suppose it's best that he doesn't have Martel take revenge on Harry by blinding him. It's fate that ends up doing Harry in--a chance car accident that takes his eyesight and kills Lena at the same time. Ernesto does take his revenge by cutting up 'Chicas y Maletas'.

If the car accident seems anti-climactic, the film's denouement appears even more so. Judit confesses first that Harry is Diego's father. She further confesses that she accepted money from Martel in exchange for revealing the whereabouts of Lena and Mateo while they were on the run back in 1994. This allowed Ernesto Jr. to film Mateo and Lena's last kiss before the unfortunate car accident. Judit makes it clear however, that Junior had nothing to do with the car accident--that it was simply a matter of fate. Fortunately, she saved the original takes of 'Chicas y Maletas' and Mateo and Diego get to work on re-editing the 'masterpiece'. Even better, Harry decides to dispense with his Harry altar ego and goes back to being Mateo. In that respect, Mateo's character arc is complete.

The film could have ended right there but no Almodovar has to show us scenes from the re-cut 'Chicas y Maletas'. And no, unfortunately, it's not the comic masterpiece, he would like his audience to think it is! It's just another example of Almodovar's tendency toward overkill in his overall approach toward film making.

Broken Embraces features rich cinematography with a plethora of arresting images. You also cannot go wrong with the actors here from Lluis Homar's low key but intense Harry and the over the top but thoroughly enjoyable Penelope Cruz. With some judicious editing (particularly with the final film within a film), Broken Embraces could have been a much better film. With Almodovar, too much of a good thing is not always good.",1280793600,2,3926,4.869760479041916

His latest film ""Broken Embraces"" has beautiful Penelope Cruz in a lead female role that she carries on well as always.  Although the story is unique, it definitely is a typical Almodovar movie in which he employs many of his ideas from the previous films.  Homosexuality, obsessive love, revenge and femme fatale are themes his fans will recognise quickly throughout the film.

This is a story of two people who loved each other deeply and sincerely.  Power, money and possesiveness got in a way of them being together and like most doomed relationships, this one was not to last.  The mere impossibility of such love to exist makes this story so lovely and touching.

3994420,3,B002VECLXM,"A film by Pedro Almodvar always offers something fresh with his unique sense of story and interesting plotlines. In Broken Embraces aka Los Abrazos Rotos in Spanish, the director in my opinion has fallen short. It does not offer anything new or exciting and seems to be a mixture of many other films but despite its flaws it is watchable if only once. Since it is a Almodvar film one expects yearning, loss, women and sex.......this film does not disappoint in any of those areas.
Harry Caine (Lluis Homar), a blind man has been living a quiet life. One day he hears the death of a wealthy tycoon and becomes upset. His assistant's son wants to know the reason so with great hesitation he starts telling his story set in the days when he used to be known as Mateo Blanco,a director who fell in love with the businessman's wife, Magdalena played by Penelope Cruz.  He makes the tycoon furious and faces trouble and tragedy.
 The film shifts back and forth but everything is neatly narrated and nothing is left unanswered. The acting by all the leads is memorable and the English subtitles are great. Color has been used very vividly and makes each scene a treat to watch. Almodvar's camera is in love with Penelope Cruz and she shines throughout the movie.
