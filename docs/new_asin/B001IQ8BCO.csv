8311263,1,B001IQ8BCO,This is awful!  The music reminds me of a funeral and the monotone voice of the narrator is depressing. This is not for me!,1455235200,,123,4.125
8311264,2,B001IQ8BCO,"I'm afraid I was disappointed by this ""workout"".  I liked the beginning section (starting gently), which includes some nice, gentle spinal twists and self-massage of the feet.  But after that, it was just TOO basic.  I'm not far past being a beginner with yoga, but have done some much better beginning yoga workouts that I enjoyed.

My problem with this workout was that I didn't feel there was a workout!!  They keep repeating basic moves over and over, which can be good for some, but not me.  It's VERY slow learning.  The dvd has a lot of different workouts, but after doing a number of them (and spending almost an hour and a half of my time), I didn't feel like I got a workout AT ALL!  So, it unfortunately was a waste of my time. I would think that beginners would actually get bored with this dvd.",1436918400,,807,4.405405405405405
8311265,5,B001IQ8BCO,Great DVD for starters.,1424390400,,23,5.0
8311266,4,B001IQ8BCO,Very nice beginners yoga dvd. It has a relaxation part n seperates the sections from a beginer yoga till a more advanced program.,1402531200,,129,4.6521739130434785
8311267,5,B001IQ8BCO,"I borrowed several yoga DVDS's from the library. This was the one I kept renewing. I've only done 2 of the 12 routines so far as they seem to fit my schedule. I do yoga in a class twice a week and the 2 routines - a.m. and p.m. - are similar to what we do in class. I've watched all the other routines and they seem challenging enough even for someone who's done yoga for a while. The instructions are very clear and you can pick your routine depending on the amount of time you have that day. The routines done with an ocean setting are especially pleasant. The Amazon price was excellent and the shipping cost reasonable. All in all, very pleased with the product",1331942400,4,665,4.244094488188976
8311268,5,B001IQ8BCO,"This DVD has a nice selection for beginners that I enjoyed.  4 that really help with movements and getting some basics down.  Another 4 to help with stress and energizing and relaxing routines and a few more that are more geared for losing weight.  I have not really used the last 4 because the others were more what I was looking for and all of them can be done by a beginner, but there is enough in there to make the DVD worthwhile.

Working with those workouts have been very helpful and this was a good pick for me.",1239494400,5,519,4.212121212121212
8311269,5,B001IQ8BCO,"This is the first yoga DVD I've bought.  Like it says, it's a great way to get started with yoga.  You get a variety of workouts by different instructors.  Some routines are a little more challenging then others but they are all good for newbies.  If you want to try yoga and aren't sure what to get, this is a really good choice.",1233619200,7,330,4.190476190476191
8311270,5,B001IQ8BCO,"This is a nice introduction to Yoga.  It's got a total of 12 different Yoga routines that cover working on flexibility, relaxation, stress related issues and some more general routines.

This DVD has different instructors.  There are a instructor interviews so you can get to know more about them and their Yoga ideas and give you suggestions on how to get the most benefit from doing Yoga.

I think all the routines  are suited for people just starting yoga.  There are routines specifically for inflexible people if you need them.  Other routines give you modifications.  Overall, this is a good sampling of yoga to get started with.  It's a compilation from other programs and each routine tells you what DVD it's from.  There are a few routines I really like and I'll probably get those DVDs next.  I liked having a mix of different things and different instructors so I can try it out and see what I like best.",1233100800,9,915,4.65625
