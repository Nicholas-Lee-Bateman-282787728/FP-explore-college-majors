4588597,5,B0056HTELS,"Every now and then a movie comes along that defies traditional story-telling techniques and yet is so hypnotically compelling that it resides in some deep level of one's soul or psyche.  Michael Frammartino's ephemeral, ineffable and sublime visit to Italy's mountain region of Calabria allows us to participate in the mysterious village life and especially that of an aged goat herder.  There's hardly a spoken word in the long takes that evoke the rituals of life and death and rebirth.  If words could do justice to this beautiful and mysterious movie, then there would be little reason to experience the film itself.  According to several interviews, director Frammartino has suggested he was inspired by Pythagoras' belief in a ""four fold"" transmigration of the soul.  The title literally translates as ""The Four Times.""  But I think this is just a ruse, because what we actually experience is the strange human rites of passage and celebration that no longer have obvious meaning to outside eyes, yet are so utterly human.

The extraordinary cinematography plays with textures, light natural sounds and the lulling jingle of goat bells in such a way as to suggest a lucid dream.  I loved this movie and for 88 minutes I was transported to another time and place that will always reside within.  What's most amazing is that the film is like an extended meditation.  I found myself pondering not so much the meaning of life but the truth of how everything is connected and though we struggle with our frail mortality, there is always mystery and beauty that remains.  There's ancient wisdom here.  You'll either get it or not.  Finally, embracing the mystery of life is all we can do, and this extraordinary film does it with a rare eloquence and elegance.

Don't miss this hypnotic and profound cinematic meditation.",1320796800,9,1821,4.966996699669967
4588598,5,B0056HTELS,"This is a review of the blu-ray of LE QUATTRO VOLTE (The Four Times).
My grandparents came from Calabria, and I have been there several times to see the relatives.  Calabria is not the land that time forgot, but it is the land that does not want to be noticed, because ""vogliono i sordi"" -- ""they want to take our money.""  This film pulls away the Calabrian veil and invites us into the life of an old shepherd, a kid goat, a tree and a wisp of smoke.  Oh, but they are a single character!  The film is full of characters, all of them lovable, but especially the dog (whose name in real life is Vuk) who manages to upstage the Good Friday procession, and Pythagoras too.  The film starts very slowly and deliberately and requires about thirty minutes of patience, and then, all of a sudden, the dog provides an incredibly well choreographed sequence of comic scenes.  I was so taken with this sequence that I had to pause the film and go get a breath of fresh air and find a friend to watch the film with, then start over.  The second time (a segunda volta) I noticed small details that were invisible the first time (a prima volta).  The old man picks up a rock from the side of the road, sets it on top of his bucket of snails, then when the snails get loose throws the rock out his window, and that same rock is used to brake the truck tire before the procession, and the dog climaxes his big scene by removing the rock, sending the truck rolling downhill to smash through the goat pen, releasing the goats into town while it is depopulated during the Good Friday ritual.  How so much action could be involved with one simple prop, a rock, is amazing.  When a film is set in the spectacular mountain country of Calabria, who needs SFX or CGI?  The anamorphic widescreen picture is very clear and allows an excellent view of the panoramic landscapes and picturesque village architecture.
So the film requires some patience to view, but gives good payback.  This is not a tease like so many artsy films, where it seems like nothing is happening and it really isn't.  Here very little is happening most of the time, but a lot is happening some of the time, and the short film manages to cover four reincarnations, which is quite a bit of territory when you think about it.  The film is great in the little details of Calabrian life, and great in the big sweep of philosophical thought, even though there is no dialogue or musical score whatsoever.  This film is not for everyone, but anyone who sees it once should see it twice.",1317081600,13,2528,4.406451612903226
4588599,5,B0056HTELS,"""Le Quattro Voltre"" or `The Four Times' is a slow moving and beautiful work of art. A silent and serene portrayal of the ideas of Pythagoras and transmigration, the idea of the soul being reincarnated again and again into humans, animals, vegetables and minerals until it is immortal; a continuous cycle of creation and existence. All of which is seen from a distance, with no dialogue or soundtrack and just the sounds of nature to accompanying the images on screen. At first we observe an old shepherd tending his flock, drinking a home remedy of water and dust from the floor of a local church, until his sudden death which is immediately proceed by the birth of a goat whose life comes to an end under a tree, which is cut down and used for a village ritual and later burned in the creation of coal, all ending in a puff of smoke from a lone chimney as ashes and dust enter the air, some of which to inevitably gather on the church floor,  everything coming full circle.

The view of the order of the world, of these people, of life and creation, existence, and superstition are all so clear it is as if you are discovering something that has been there all along but are only now recognizing, like an acknowledgement of complex themes for the first time done through the simplest means.

By simple I mean restrained and meditative. I was personally surprised in how given the lack of any real action or narrative it still managed to be totally engrossed within every second of every frame. Whether it was a moment of subtle and natural humor, or due to hypnotic events including an astonishing longshot involving a dog and a truck; it all builds up to an enlightening revelation in the very end, the sort that makes you rethink and reexamine everything that had come before it and naturally leads to further pondering on its themes and meanings long after its conclusion.

It truly is an incredibly fascinating piece of art that from a distance many would probably expect couldn't say much, and under another director that would have most likely been true, but Michelangelo Frammartino's ability to be so minimalistic yet still communicate on such a cosmic scale is as mystifying as it is refreshing and the reason it works. This is a wonderful achievement, however it is not for those unattuned to any sort of art-house cinema and most are better off ignoring this, the majority of the general movie going audience in fact would probably find it to be a tedious and monotonous affair. On the other hand, for those interested and willing to sit quietly and observe while allowing themselves to be overcome by a surreal and profound work of art this is the `must see' film of the year.",1313539200,27,2689,4.631027253668763
4588600,5,B0056HTELS,"Having been on a kick of watching films labeled as 'Slow Cinema' there are a number of stylistic similarities that, while I don't think each director is conscience of in a sense of copying or mimicking from other directors in this style, nevertheless is similar to each of these films.

The most obvious is the use of the long take. Each of these films have shots that can last for many minutes typically with minimal or even no camera movement. These lingering shots allow you to take in far more visual information than a more conventional film because the director wants you to see everything in the frame. And because there is no cutting to direct our attention to a specific action on screen, every movement within the frame becomes far more important. I think of it like going to live theater where the director has no control over what the audience chooses to look at on stage. Some people may be watching the actor who is speaking, another member of the audience may be looking at the backdrop, another might be watching an extra in the background. Even if the villain pulls out a gun on stage and shoots the hero, we can choose to look at whatever we want. In a standard film the director and editor will just show on screen only that which they want you to see.

So in Slow Cinema we are given a freedom of observation. Directors who use this slow style might draw your attention in with minuscule movements on screen, such as a man on a homemade raft slowly drifting across a pond, or they will allow for a lot of movement, but linger on it for so long, such as a person walking or a horse pulling a cart, that the importance of the action is heightened.

This is what Slow Cinema does best, it draws our attention to action we would otherwise not be aware of in normal life. True, we may be aware of a slight breeze passing through the leaves of the trees in a field, but how often do we spend the time to actually watch this action? How many minor, seemingly unimportant actions are going on all around us without us being fully aware of them?

These are some of the problems Slow Cinema attempts to address - the action that takes place when we've stopped defining what action really is, such as a car chase, a bank robbery, a sex scene, or witty dialogue. Slow Cinema hopes to show us there is an entirely other world of action all around us, that the world is constantly alive with a hum of unseen action. We live in a world of constant change and movement but because we chose to only see action as something that is dramatic or we only react to action that we've been biologically predisposed to care about (is that a tiger stalking us in that dark jungle?) we've filtered out the actions that aren't immediate.

This film attempts to play the very long game of observation by making us aware not only of the slow movements of our own life, but that of multiple lives, one of which is that of a tree. Through four different characters - an old goat shepherd, a kid goat, a tree, and the element carbon (through the process of making charcoal) - the film attempts to show us what Carl Sagan taught us in Cosmos that we are all interconnected to the totality of the universe (star stuff as Sagan called it). The film shows us even though one life ends, life still endures and  even when we have died we are still a part of the vast machine of the universe.

Another aspect of Slow Cinema is that of the strangeness of the world we live in, very often explored through various uses of magic realism. In one film the ghost of a long dead son might just appear during a family dinner, or a monkey might speak, or fire will no longer work, or a massive stuffed whale and a Russian midget will drive a town insane, or a man's dead wife will come back to life during her wake, or Roman Centurions in full gear will jump out of a two-stroke cart. And while these are overt attempts by directors of Slow Cinema to explore themes of nature and death and oppression, religion is also a common theme that while some people will be offended at it being categorized with magic realism, is nevertheless the same because it attempts to answer questions pure science and reason cannot.

This film incorporates elements of the Catholic faith that are probably unknown to anyone outside of the few people living in the village in this film. Dust swept up in the church is collected and given as a sort of cure-all medicine (in this case to the old goat shepherd). And while we are not given much of an explanation, we can intuit what is happening: that the dust has been imbued with holy (read: magical) properties and that since it has come from a holy and sanctified place that it possess holy (again, magical) properties.

In other films, such as Into Great Silence,religion is the central focus but it too takes on a magical quality. The monks in that film seem to have transcended base human action and exist purely as spiritual and profound beings.

Slow Cinema is far less interested in rational explanations for the world and is always trying to connect us to a place where we are free to wonder and marvel at the moments that are normally missed. This can seem as if many of these films are a rejection of modern civilization, that they bemoan technology and its influence on human society, and in a way this is accurate, but only insofar as these filmmakers only want us to expand our limited view of the world. Why can't we live in a world where imagination is just as important as logic? Why can't we see the magic in the sun shining across a window pane? Why do we have to live in a world where everything needs to be explained?

So in many ways these films look at the world the way a child comprehends the world - a world where time is stretched out because everything is new to their senses and they are always trying to take it all in and a world where magic is hidden in every sunbeam because they do not yet understand there is a mass of fusing hydrogen 93 million miles away. A child can be endlessly fascinated with watching ants crawl about or with the snow falling on their faces. So why can't we?

Now I realize I have done a terrible job at talking about this particular film, but the film embodies everything about the style of Slow Cinema that it would be difficult to fully appreciate it without understanding why it was made the way it was. Not that the film does not stand on its own - it's a wonderful and beautiful film - but we can see so much more when we put in the extra effort. As William Blake said:

To see a world in a grain of sand
And a heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
And eternity in an hour.",1406332800,,6666,4.353177795655672

The photography and the flow of the film was quite beautiful but there is absolutely no dialogue. Nevertheless for those who are willing to observe and be taken by the flow of the film there is deep spiritual wisdom in this film about the human condition. I realised the real theme of the movie on Ash Wednesday when the priest said ""from ashes we come, and to ashes we shall return"". In a very beautiful and simple way this film shows the cycles of life from the ashes in the church, to the goat herder, then to his goats, then to lush forests of Calabria, then to the community celebration of Christmas, then the burning of the wood into charcoal, and then the return of the charcoal to the church. It is a sublime commentary on the existence of a poor goat herder who lives out a life of simplicity in the hills of Calabria and how he is intimately connected with all of God's creation.",1362873600,,1022,4.356020942408377
4588606,5,B0056HTELS,"Definitely NOT for everyone!  This movie must belong to a genre with relatively few films in it.

A couple of years ago, a friend introduced me to a movie about the daily life of monks in a monastery where they had all taken a vow of silence.  Definitely a ""silent"" film (lol), and not exactly a thriller.  Like we say to one of my friends... ""it doesn't have anything that blows up, so you wouldn't like it"".  :-)

Well, this one is in a similar vein.  I believe the title stands for ""The Four Seasons""... and it focuses on the life of pretty old gentleman in some old Italian village, as well as some of the 'customs' in that village as well (I suppose 'old' is redundant when referring to Italian villages?).  It's been nearly a year since I've seen it on a large cinema screen (I haven't had a chance to watch this DVD yet), so my memory of the contents is pretty fuzzy.  I just remember I enjoyed it.  Again - not much blows up - so if you're into things blowing up, this isn't for you.  Much time is spent viewing something that I couldn't figure out - until near the end I began thinking I must've figured it out... but had to research the movie to verify my idea (I was right).  And there's some time spent on the preparation for & execution of a celebratory custom the village has.  And of course - there's this old gentleman... and *his* custom for remaining healthy.  I don't recall if there was ANY dialogue in the film... but if there was, it certainly wasn't pervasive, or memorable.  ;-)

As for ordering this Blu-Ray disc... the ordering/shipping/receiving process was excellent.

And if you're someone who actually enjoys this movie, it would be interesting to hear from you (if there's a mechanism for you to 'contact' me?), to find out what kind of person likes this type of thing.

4588611,4,B0056HTELS,"<strong>Le Quattro Volte</strong> (Michelangelo Frammartino, 2010)

This might be a spoiler, I'm not sure, so if you don't want to know, skip the first paragraph: From watching the trailers, hearing about this movie, etc., I had been under the impresion it was a documentary. It was only once we got about half an hour into the film and I started noticing how incredibly composed some of the shots were that I realized it is, in fact, a work of fiction. My reaction to this revelation was about the opposite of what it usually is; I became even more enchanted with this gorgeous, almost-silent little film than I already was. Which is not to say it doesn't have a few problems here and there, and I'm not sure it's ever going to end up on anyone's list of classic cinema, but for all that it's one of the most enjoyable times I've had watching a film in recent memory.

The movie recounts the death of a shepherd (Giuseppe Fuda in his only screen role to date) from the southern Italian province of Calabria, and then explores the Pythagorean idea that the soul goes through three more stages before progressing to [...wherever; the movie, for all its pretensions, does not get into <em>that</em> question, and that was a very good choice indeed]; the animal, the vegetable, and the mineral. (Note: you'll need to pay close attention during at least one of these transitions to get what Frammartino's on about, and even then, it may require a bit of post-viewing reflection.) And then... well, that would be telling, wouldn't it?

I can see where there are a lot of things about this movie that would annoy some folks. The utter lack of dialogue, for example. (There is some background dialogue, but it's indistinct; don't bother trying to make it out.) The movie's studied slowness. Its complete lack of characterization during the final half of the film (after all, the main ""character"" is now deceased). Etc. The best way to think of <em>Le Quattro Volte</em> is as a painting, but a moving one; it is a thing of great beauty that one looks at and puzzles out without necessarily identifying with. This is not necessarily a bad thing. However, it's obviously not for everyone. It probably <em>should</em> be, but it isn't. *** ",1341532800,,2230,4.739690721649485

Eternity in Hell comes closer.

I have in fact seen lots of things like this movie. The ""works"" of Donal Judd for instance, or the ""music"" of Phillip Glass"" to name a couple of sources of this kind of minimalist nonsense. My 8 year old daughter observed 10 seconds in to it that "".......this is very boring!""

I suggested that we give it a chance as I spent many memorable hours in the 70's watching foreign films (usually under the herbal influence) and know very well that you have to give these slow paced artsy movies a fair shot.

4588617,4,B0056HTELS,"For those of us who live day in and day out with our cell phones, Internet, DVR's and technology... sometimes, you need a little diversion and get perspective of an opposite lifestyle, simplistic and very traditional.

The film ""Le Quattro Volte"" (The Four Times) is one of those films that showcases a life that many people still live, in this case, in Italy's mountainous region of Calabria.

Directed by artist/architect/photographer turned filmmaker Michelangelo Frammartino (""The Gift"") comes a beautiful film that explores Pythagoras (an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathemetician and founder of the religious movement known as Pythgoreanism and a man known to influence Plato) and his belief in the four times or the four levels of existence.

According to Pythagoras' belief, human souls went through animal, vegetable and mineral states.

With that being said, the film begins with an elderly goat herder (played by Gieuseppe Fuda), a sick man who drinks the dust of the church floor each night.  A nightly ritual which he believes, keeps him alive.  One night he forgets to drink his concoction and dies in his sleep.

This then transforms to Pythagoras' second time of existence and then we see the birth of a goat.  We watch as the goat from birth and eventually grows but becomes separated by the other goats one day and is left alone to be by itself.

This leads to the third existence which is the vegetable existence and in this case, we see a large tree which is cut down and used for a village celebration.  And then after the celebration is done, the tree is cut up and then turned to charcoal (mineral state).

""Le Quattro Volte"" is a spiritual, cinematic poem of Pythagoras four levels of existence and invites viewers to see a traditional way of life that still exists today.

VIDEO:

""Le Quattro Volte"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film is beautiful!  From the older buildings that exist in Calabria, the details on the face of the goat herder as he sits and we can see details as bugs fly in his face, an ant crawling on a tree, the birth of a goat and the remnants of the afterbirth on it.  But most beautiful is the cinematography by Andrea Locatelli, showing us the beauty of the mountainous region of Calabria through different seasons.

While not as vibrant or highly detailed compared to a documentary like ""Planet Earth"" or other nature films that are meant to be showcased in HD, ""Le Quattro Volte"" is still a beautiful film that manages to capture the look and feel of the village and its surrounding area with great efficacy.

AUDIO:

There is no dialogue, no music in ""Le Quattro Volte"". It's a film that focuses on ambiance of the area of where it's shot in.  You do get a lot of goats making noise and while a lot of the film is coming through the center and front channels.  I did notice a few ambiance especially during the goat scenes coming from the surround channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Le Quattro Volte"" comes with its theatrical trailer and stills gallery.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Beautiful and also interesting film based on Pythagoras' ""four levels of existence"".

The film is without dialogue, without music and its present day activity of the village of Calabria in Southern Italy and what we see today is probably what has happened in Calabria for a very long time.  Villagers with their goat herders, goat herders walking the goats through the village and the open streets and bridge in order to get to a destination for the goats to eat.  Then you have your Christmas day and Easter celebration and an whimsical look at the surroundings of the village.  It's greenery, the mountains over the distance, the village in their very old buildings and the happiness of the villagers during their celebrations or just getting a bag of coal and of course, images of the making of the coal.

This is a slice-of-life documentary but it makes you wonder... was everything real or was everything staged?

We see the elderly herder gasping his last breath and his chest no longer moving.  Is this an actor or did Michelangelo Frammartino capture onscreen a man's death?

There is no doubt that Frammartino was able to capture impressive moments on camera.  From the birth of a goat, to a vehicle hitting an area releasing the goats to a single young goat being left behind and stuck in a ditch to be left wandering alone and no help in sight.

As I watched the film with my wife, she asked me... is this a real film that incorporates documentary elements or is this a full-on documentary capturing life and death?  As far as I know, ""Le Quattro Volte"" is a documentary capturing Calabrian life, showing us everyday life that continues in today's world but yet a tradition that probably has gone on in the village for centuries, that has not been affected by modern day technology.  Aside from a vehicle that transports the coal, everything else featured in the film shows no relation to the life that many of us live.

These are people who don't use cell phones, Internet.  There are no signs of telephone polls, no signs of microwave ovens or television sets.

If anything, Michelangelo Frammartino has done a great job in breaking down the film into Pythagoras' four levels of existence and focusing on the shepherd (human), the goats...and the baby goat (animal), a tree (vegetable) and the tree being turned into coal (mineral).

The film is for the patient viewers who can sit, enjoy nature and enjoying the serenity of what is shown on camera.  We see visual beauty but I have to admit that I found myself chuckling in the moments of seeing these goats behave towards each other.  From their behavior of knocking down a broom, one goat on top of a table and not knowing how to get down, seeing a dog interfering with the Easter celebration, there are so many of these moments with animals that are fun in their own way, but of course, it's all subjective to the viewer.

The Blu-ray release features the beauty of Calabria and for those wanting to see the beauty in 1080p, the Blu-ray release is the way to go.  This is not a film in which to expect a lot of audio, there is no dialogue or musical soundtrack played during the film.  It's pretty much a straight-forward, easily accessible film about life in Calabria.

Throughout the film, no one questions the livelihood of the villagers, nor do we question the dust that the herder drinks every night.  We know that cultures have its traditions and old concocted remedies, but that's part of life.  We know that goats are a big part of other cultures around the world for their meat or their milk and that is a part of life.  But to get a visual  of this old world and see it in a film is quite amusing, breathtakingly beautiful and also humorous.

Overall, ""Le Quattro Volte"" is a film that may not be for the masses, especially those who are not patient with slow paced scenery and breathtaking backdrops but for me, there is a sense of peace and tranquility that comes with the viewing of ""Le Quattro Volte"", an appreciation of what filmmaker Michelangelo Frammartino had accomplished which made my viewing experience of the film worth the while.

""Le Quattro Volte"" is recommended!",1323993600,8,7197,4.706869009584665

The cinematography, writing and directing were not bad either - well, Ok, engagingly spot on.

Interpretation hints (beware, use while or after viewing):
Thoughts of a deeper story start sneaking in when after the goat herder dies we next find our viewing attention shifted to a newly born kid (baby goat) who we wonder might be in a perilous predicament when lost alone under a tree then to have our viewing attention shifted to that tree being cut down for a ceremony and then finally being cut up to make charcoal. You then think back to the beginning when the herder is given what appears to be ashes swept from a floor (left over from burned charcoal and spread by the wind throughout the village?) to take as folk medicine for his pneumonia. So is it a cycle?",1322956800,,1179,4.836633663366337

I specifically looked for a film that I'd find inspiring, profound, that would make me feel glad to be alive.  Based on the rave reviews, I watched.  This wasn't it.

***BIG SPOILERS FOLLOW of the READ ME! KIND***  Let me summarize it for you: unheeded, lone lives end in death/dissolution.  At least two suffer alone before dying.  Four lives are detailed- the first: an old goatherd, growing sicker with each passing day, knocks in vain on a bolted church door but no-one answers (the church has only DIRT to offer him, and in the end, not even that).  He then goes home and collapses.  The next morning his dog barks frantically, trying to summon aid, but people are too busy with their own doings (ironically, a rich, formal ""religious"" procession)- they throw sticks and stones at him, and disappear in the distance, oblivious to someone in dire need mere feet away (this scene is described as ""humorous"" by some, due to the dog's desperate antics).  The man dies, while his goats bleat pitifully.  BTW, the compassionate dog unfailingly evinces concern and takes responsibility for others' welfare, unlike human beings in the film.

Next is shown one of the man's goats giving birth.  The playful, curious, seemingly irrepressible kid has her mouth roughly tied shut with string (presumably to keep her from waylaying her mother and the herd by trying to nurse), then is led out with the other goats for a trek to the hills.  She can't keep up, is left behind, and gets lost.  Since her mouth is bound, she can't eat, and dies of starvation at the base of a tree, alone.  I found her cries, her small, vulnerable form and pain-filled eyes hard to bear.

The next life is that of the tree, a majestic lone pine on a mountaintop.  It is felled, chopped into logs, then burned and converted to charcoal (the 4th incarnation). The director made a point of showing the workmen carelessly strewing the logs about, as if they're nothing, refuse (one of the few close-ups of townspeople- others include muzzling the goat, and awkwardly manhandling the goatherd's crude coffin out of his dwelling).  Indeed, none of the lives are treated with respect or care, except possibly the coal, as it's bagged for sale, a commodity.  And finally, a relentless truck that has trundled past the shepherd's house in previous  shots, oblivious to the man, the goats, and the dog, the one which carried his body away (I think), now brings charcoal to the house's new occupant.  The truck has endured while our protagonists have not.  The final shot shows smoke issuing from the chimney, dissipating in the cold air.

Wow.  The cycle of ""life"".  Ain't it grand.  In nearly every shot humans are distant, silent or muffled, self-involved, working in the background, as it were (insidious, viral?).  They're oblivious to the protagonists, at least two of whom lead lives with seemingly few joys or triumphs, lives that end unheralded, in pain and suffering.  Perhaps the pristine dwellings shown at a distance are full of others also leading lonely lives of desperation and futility.  Each of the four incarnations is ""of use"" in some sense- the man and his goats supply milk; the kid's body feeds worms and the tree; the charcoal from the tree warms the house.  Perhaps the smoke is meant to symbolize final freedom from this terrible existence.  Or, perhaps something precious has ""gone up in smoke.""

I saw only faint hints of the transmigration of souls, e.g., one shot of the base of the tree where the kid perished.  It's notable that typically the transmigration of souls involves ascension from ""lower"" forms to higher, culminating in the ""ultimate""- human; it was significant that the reverse was implied.  Nearly every scene in this film screams of disconnection, depersonalization, desperation, futility, dissolution.

The director went to great pains (pun intended) to craft one existentially disturbing scene after another (e.g., one in which the old man puts some snails in a large, decrepit pot to eat at a later time.  He anchors the misshapen lid to keep them from escaping.  The next day, somehow or other the lid has come off and the snails are making their getaway (echoed in a later scene by the goats' bid for freedom).  One by one the man captures them and returns them to the pot, foiling their escape- a dark, chilling scene, which reminded me of HAL silently, inexorably cutting off each means of escape in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B0093QJSIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>.  Many scenes were reminiscent of that film, especially the director's use of ominous, foreboding silence that underscored the peril that lurked beneath the facade.  There were affecting Escher-like shots of lone people endlessly ascending and descending myriad parallel staircases- though close in proximity, remote from each other.  A thought-provoking film, indeed, but not provocative of well-being for some, so bear that in mind (my reason for writing this review- the movie deeply saddened me, something not suggested by other reviews I read).

I don't find anything inherently disturbing about death, to the contrary, I like films that help people better come to terms with it.  But death isn't noble or of value in itself, only as the flip-side to a life well-lived or one that has meaning.  I like the old Native-American saying:

""When you were born you cried
and the world rejoiced-
Live your life so that when you die
the world cries and YOU rejoice.""

If you find someone trudging over hill and dale in tortured pain, schlepping milk all over town to people who don't know he's alive so he can buy a few snails to eat, and dying alone with no-one to care or comfort him meaningful and inspiring, you'll revel in this film.  Ditto with lost, dying baby goats and magnificent trees felled and burned, replacing oxygen in the air with carbon dioxide.

As for me, I was looking for something to give me a boost of inspiration, something that would make me glory in life.  Perhaps those who described it as serene, profound, inspiring, etc. watched it while checking facebook, helping kids with their homework, sipping wine or cuddling or chatting with someone.  I find it hard to fathom how anyone who gave this film their undivided attention, with faculties intact could be undisturbed by the misery and discord radiating from the goatherd and his animals, even from the tree, or by the film's larger implications.

To me it seemed a cautionary tale ABOUT reducing precious lives to ""abstractions"", about people becoming desensitized and inured to the suffering of others and the impact of their blind, self-serving ways. ""Beautiful abstractions"" (a phrase used in several rave reviews) are all some 50% of species on earth soon WILL be, as tangible as dragons or unicorns, thanks to this kind of thinking.  It struck me as an allegory for how we treat each other, those with whom we share the planet, the environment, the earth itself.  Horrifying.  It's undeniably gifted, powerful film-making, with stunning cinematography- brilliant.  In truth I could've just as easily accorded it five stars- I gave it one to counter others' characterization of it as a ""celebration"" of life.  I found it the exact opposite.

Four films with similar themes that I did love (the first two possibly disturbing to the tender of heart), because of the way protagonists lived their lives, reacted to seeming insignificance and powerlessness, and triumphed in the face of adversity and even death were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Return/dp/B005DWBIAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Return</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-From-Titov-Veles/dp/B00GG1RE8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am From Titov Veles</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cherry-Blossoms/dp/B004I6LB1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cherry Blossoms</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Still-Mine/dp/B00IOFDKKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Still Mine</a>.

8459634,5,B0056HTELS,"Reality. The Greeks said there are two kinds of reality: ""normal"" reality which everyone (except nut cases) agrees on, and philosophical reality which can never be finally depicted, but which is the product of rational thinking and discourse about what it is. In this second way, philosophers attempt to understand reality. Poetry uses metaphor to depict thoughts and in that way, actually comes closer to reality than philosophy: if everything is ""representation"" then, the depiction of reality through metaphor is more ""accurate."" (Comedy uses irony to depict a ""larger"" reality.) LeQuattroVolte is lyric poetry in cinematic form. I don't want to say one more word about it, because talk might spoil the experience for you. All I will say is that my wife and I loved the film so much that we gave it as Christmas presents to thirteen of our closest friends; I don't think it made any impression on any of them, except one woman with whom I meet once a week to talk about poetry who ""got"" it.",1419984000,3,993,4.812865497076023
