8310238,4,B001HZY1KM,"This is a CNBC documentary about the state of GM around 2009. It consists of four major segments:
1) Interview w/Bob Lutz
2) Description of GM business in China
3) Interview with Ed Welburn about the upcoming Camaro, includes a Dale Earnhardt Jr. test drive
4) All about the Volt, at this point just a show car and the production drive train in a Malibu
This is all before bankruptcy and the Gov't. bail out. In that bail out the CEO Rick Wagoner will be outed. He is interviewed a lot for this video, but not as much as Bob Lutz. The DVD includes bonus footage of the GM Heritage Center with a walk-around the classic cars with Bob Lutz. I enjoyed this DVD. It makes you want to drop by Bob Lutz's house and talk cars!",1494979200,,719,4.255474452554744
