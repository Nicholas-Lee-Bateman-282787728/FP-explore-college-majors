8454926,5,B005318JXQ,"New to the K-drama craze, I ordered this movie not knowing that it has to be the right region, for the movie to play.  I sent it back & Kimchee Boy's Stephen wrote an explaination & refunded my $, in the nicest possible way.  Though I missed out on a cool movie (I'll save for the universal regions model), I had a very positive interaction w/ a really kind guy.  I would recommend Kimchee Boy to anyone!",1343001600,,404,4.220779220779221
