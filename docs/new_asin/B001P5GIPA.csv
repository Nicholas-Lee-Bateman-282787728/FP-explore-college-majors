3738330,5,B001P5GIPA,This has to be one of my top 10 drama TV shows. The characters in these stories really make you feel for the group. A must watch and the series is only about 18 episodes long over three seasons.,1324166400,5,194,4.0
3738331,5,B001P5GIPA,"The show is terrific. The writing, acting and production values are all excellent. The BBC does a great job. The second season isn't yet available on Netflix, so I bought it here. Streaming quality on my 50"" plasma TV was really good...just as clear as Netflix streaming, not quite as clear as true HDTV or a DVD. The picture was widescreen. I'm satisfied. I believe streaming quality depends on connection speed. A slower connection speed means more highly compressed video and a lower quality picture.",1310601600,2,503,4.929411764705883
3738332,2,B001P5GIPA,"I downloaded this for the PC to display on my 40"" TV via HDMI.  Video quality is horrible looks fuzzy like SD content.

Love the show bad video quality.",1308096000,,152,4.206896551724138
3738343,4,B001P5GIPA,"REALLY ENJOYED THE UK VERSION. STREAMING QUALITY WAS EXCELLENT. I JUST WISHED THAT THE EPISODES CAME ON AUTOMATICALLY, INSTEAD OF STOPPING AND CLICKING ON NEW EPISODE.",1377820800,,167,5.461538461538462
3738344,4,B001P5GIPA,"Excellent British series, much better than the American copycat!

Really enjoyable with great acting. The English accents make it so fun to listen to. The situations were interesting and funny.",1376784000,,193,5.433333333333334
3738345,2,B001P5GIPA,Very different from season one not enough excitement. I am going to check out season 3 to see if it gets better,1376524800,,111,4.090909090909091
3738346,4,B001P5GIPA,"It's a great show if you enjoy watching women make really bad choices about men which further complicates their lives. Some of the tangles are hard to believe because can anyone really be that immoral? But, I guess the answer is yes! Suspend reality and go with it. You won't be disappointed.",1375228800,,292,4.634615384615385
3738347,3,B001P5GIPA,"I saw Season One on Netflix and thought it was so much fun that I couldn't wait for Season Two.  Found it on Amazon and began watching with great anticipation.  Suddenly, these women . . . and I mean all of them . . . started ticking me off.  Grown women with utterly NO self-control are hard to watch. These women do not represent modern woman at all. They are whiny, self-indulgent and so out of the realm of reality for today's woman that you want to pitch shoes at the screen. The men are saps. And the conventional plot lines quickly become a bore. I won't write anything here that might spoil it for others, but I got halfway through Season Two and thought, ""I MUST have better things to do than this. There is some paint drying over in that corner . . . ""  So disappointed.  After powering through ""The Shield"" and ""The Fringe"" (which I loved), this just looks like cotton candy, and not even yummy cotton candy. I take that back.  Jessica's clothes and shoes were fun to look at. I will give the show that. For the rest?  Eh. Too bad.",1374796800,,1042,4.258883248730965
3738348,5,B001P5GIPA,Great series and I finished series one & on to two & three & so on.  What will I do when I get to the end.,1374710400,,106,3.076923076923077
3738349,4,B001P5GIPA,"Let's face it.  This is not high drama, but it is fun to watch! The characters are funny, look good and have that tongue in cheek British humor.  Liked this series much better than the American version.",1374624000,,202,4.4324324324324325
3738350,5,B001P5GIPA,Very entertaining.  My wife and I really enjoyed this series and highly recommend it.  Well cast and acted - watch it.,1374624000,,118,4.571428571428571
3738351,1,B001P5GIPA,"The first season had its moments, but this second season is a decline.  The characters are selfish, self-absorbed, make awful decisions and are hard to believe. If you're going to make a show about flawed characters behaving badly I think the character and plot development has to be really good, plausible and make you want to root for the characters in some way--not happening here.",1374537600,,384,4.907692307692308
3738352,3,B001P5GIPA,"I would only give this two stars since it is a walking clich, but it takes itself so seriously that you have to enjoy the camp.  No need to buy a novel at the grocery store this month, you know the ones next to the magazine display, this covers every possible plot point.",1374364800,,271,4.113207547169812

3738354,5,B001P5GIPA,"This is a fantastic series.  The four women in it are sensational and the story-lines are dramatic and oh so addictive!  Once you start with Season 1, Season 2 is a must!!",1373932800,,171,4.3125
3738355,5,B001P5GIPA,I've seen the UK version on BBC America a couple of times & loved it. Watching the US version on ABC has been  realllllly hard for me to do. It's just such a poor imitation. Every actor is wrong for the part. Yuk! Just watch the UK original - you'll be so relieved to see a truly excellent series.,1373932800,,297,4.033898305084746
3738356,5,B001P5GIPA,"i loved this series more than the american one running now on abc television.. done well and love the characters acting,,all of them were fantastic,,",1373500800,,149,5.0
3738357,5,B001P5GIPA,"Great series, well written and played. The girls get into all kinds of capers and problems and just reinforce the idea that nothing lasts forever and most things may not be what they seem...take a second look, not to be suspicious, just not stupid",1373500800,,247,4.636363636363637
3738358,5,B001P5GIPA,The British version of Mistresses was more enjoyable than the American version of which I have seen two shows.  Would like to see Season 3 of the British version  when its available.,1371686400,,182,4.65625
3738359,5,B001P5GIPA,"Really enjoyed this show, loved the women and the British day to day life? Fun to watch and would recommend it.",1371686400,,111,4.333333333333333
3738360,5,B001P5GIPA,"Season 2 is unpredictable, fun, real and suspenseful. You become invested in these characters and want the best fir them.",1371686400,,121,5.1
3738361,5,B001P5GIPA,Enjoyed it immensely never boring just loved it. I loved all the characters and wonderful story. I highly recommend it.,1371081600,,119,5.0
3738362,5,B001P5GIPA,"great show, wish it ran longer....... I hope the U.S, version can stand up to my standards set by the U.K. Version!!",1370908800,,116,4.318181818181818
3738373,5,B001P5GIPA,I am hooked.  I just hope the American series will not be a total disappointment compared to this cast.  I highly recommend it.,1370822400,,127,4.478260869565218
3738374,5,B001P5GIPA,"I loved this show and season, I hope that the US version is just as good . . . i miss this show already.",1370822400,,104,3.375

3738376,5,B001P5GIPA,"Once you start watching this series you want to watch right thru to the end, and hope it continues.
The story line keeps you wanting more!",1370649600,,138,4.346153846153846
3738377,4,B001P5GIPA,"I've been watching a lot of BBC shows lately and stumbled across this one. I rather enjoyed the whole series. I enjoyed the characters and seeing how they got themselves out of (or back into) their ""mistress"" situations. Never a dull moment!",1370476800,,241,4.761904761904762
3738378,3,B001P5GIPA,This is an addictive series. Kind of like a guilty pleasure. This is my second time to watch it as I had to remind myself of the story line prior to watching series 3,1370044800,,166,3.911764705882353
3738379,4,B001P5GIPA,"Lots and lots of drama, twists and turns galore. I wonder how the US version compares to this UK series....
Wish there were more seasons available.",1369440000,,147,4.6923076923076925
3738380,5,B001P5GIPA,"I really enjoyed this series, just a shame it was so short. I am glad to see that ABC is picking it up and doing their own version of the show. Hope it is just as good.",1368489600,,168,3.5675675675675675

3738382,4,B001P5GIPA,I love watching material about women's relationships whether fiction or non-fiction. The way we relate to people is so interesting!,1367971200,,131,5.6
3738383,5,B001P5GIPA,"Great drama, about, love, sex and every day life!
Wish it had more than 3 seasons and didn't go off the air so soon!!",1367712000,,117,3.9166666666666665
3738384,5,B001P5GIPA,"I like British shows and this series is a good one to watch if you want to kill a few hours.  I am enjoying my Amazon Prime, especially being able to watch free shows on my iphone, iPad, or PS3!",1367020800,,194,3.85
3738385,5,B001P5GIPA,"This series transfixed me. So many levels, so much emotion. Very real & revelatory. BBC does it again. I only wish it went longer.",1366156800,,130,4.458333333333333
3738386,5,B001P5GIPA,It's a show I never expected to like but fell in love with it and all the characters. I wish it had lasted longer than 3 seasons.,1365638400,,129,3.814814814814815

3738389,5,B001P5GIPA,Great smutty drama...like Sex in the City all grown up.  Watched all 3 seasons in a couple weeks...without kids of course!,1363219200,,122,4.809523809523809
3738390,5,B001P5GIPA,Through-put speed is slow for video. Audio is faster than video. Netflix does not have this problem. I hope amazon can address this issue. I am going to stay with the service any way because it does not detract from getting the full effect of watching the show.,1362182400,,261,4.458333333333333
3738391,3,B001P5GIPA,"I loved the first season and was drawn into the stories but the second season is just making me mad!  The women keep making bad choices and I'm not sure I want to continue watching awkward scenes, hurt feelings, damaged families, etc.",1360454400,4,234,4.571428571428571

These characters warm my soul!",1431129600,,102,5.0588235294117645
8332143,4,B001P5GIPA,why did Amazon have to switch back to Mistresses being a non-Prime series? I was just in the middle of Season 2... Real bummer.,1381708800,3,127,4.333333333333333
8332144,3,B001P5GIPA,"This is the BBC version of Mistresses, not the American crap that came on TV this summer. I was in the middle of the second season, viewing the episodes for free with my Amazon Prime. When I finished the 5th episode and went to watch the 6th, it suddenly became paid. What the heck? I am extremely disappointed that I can't watch the rest of the episodes that I started watching for free. I am not going to pay $1.99 per episode and I'm in the middle of a season so I am not going to waste the money to buy the whole season. Thumbs DOWN to Amazon. Booooo.",1381104000,4,555,4.10091743119266
8332145,5,B001P5GIPA,this was intriguing from the start of season 1 and I could not wait to see the next episode to see what was gonna happen....the writers and directors and producers were really excellent in bringing this series to an exciting and wonderful close....I fell in love with each of the characters and truly cared about their lives and how they were developing....all the loose ends were tied up perfectly and I say bravo to all those involved in this project..,1381017600,,454,4.6875

8332148,3,B001P5GIPA,great acting with solid performances. i am glad to see some characters growing. i am concerned it is becoming formulaic.,1379203200,,120,5.05
8332149,5,B001P5GIPA,"Each episode had me wanting to see the next.  Trudy is especially good in this season.  Actually, I like all the ladies' characters.  There really needs to be more episodes of this show.  Hoping to see more in the future.",1378771200,,221,4.45
