5734625,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"I am so happy that I purchased this DVD.  Nicky is absolutely wonderful.  In addition, I love the music, the setting and the exercises.  The whole experience of working out to this DVD is elegant and peaceful but you do work all of your muscles.  You feel energized and yet relaxed when you are finished.  I would rate the exercise routine as intermediate.  It has been an excellent purchase for me as I love the barre-type workouts and this is one of my absolute favorites!  Very well done!",1391731200,10,491,4.511363636363637
5734626,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"I loved this workout. It really felt like I was in a ballet class at a studio. Not only that, it was easy to follow. The exercises were somewhat challenging, however. She is a very friendly, professional, encouraging instructor. By the end of ""class"" I felt like a graceful ballerina. I also appreciate the subtle, classical music because that's what I expect from an actual ballet class. I do recommend this workout.",1387238400,9,417,4.805555555555555
5734627,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"As a disabled veteran with chronic fatigue, I am constantly looking for short, but effective workouts. I don't know any ballet, but found that I could do all of these moves (though I sometimes use a chair to help balance). The sections are split up in reasonable portions, so you can do as much, or as little as you want. I have lost weight, and built muscle tone just doing 7-15 minutes a day. I would recommend  this video to everyone.",1386979200,55,437,4.395061728395062
5734628,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"I really love this dvd. It's something different for me. There's no cueing, so you really have to pay attention. But all in all it's interesting, and you really do get a workout.",1386892800,18,178,4.424242424242424
5734629,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"Instructions are spoken slowly and you are able to do them with her at the pace for the routine.

5734630,4,B00CQ8NXY4,"This is an excellent DVD of Ballet Conditioning. I love the music, which includes many classical pieces from Ballet. It also has some elements of Yoga music as well. Nicky is great, in one section she refers to the exercise ""Bingo Wings"" for Bat Wings which is hilarious. This DVD is actually 65 minutes, and divided into 6 parts, all great. If you are looking for a conditioning class that can give you great results, this one is it. She uses the elements of Ballet (and some Yoga) to strength and elongated the limbs, and tone the abs. So if you work slowly at this routine, it will definitely give you the long lean figure you are wanting. It worked for me!!  Watch out for some cueing omissions when doing some leg exercises, other than that, it is great. Hope this review is helpful to you.",1386115200,33,795,4.445205479452055
5734631,1,B00CQ8NXY4,"I ordered this item a while ago and waited for it to be delivered to Switzerland by my friend (on whose address I ordered it in the US). Imagine my disappointment when I tried to play it and the DVD does not work, just freezes the program. Now I cant get the money back, and I cant get a replacement. Very unpleasant experience.",1385251200,,328,4.222222222222222
5734632,3,B00CQ8NXY4,"Amazon doesn't allow half scores so I would rate it 3.5 stars if I could.

Ballet Fitness is the sort of workout you would expect a ballerina or dancer does as part of their fitness/toning regime. It is all very doable for a non dancer such as myself - though a strong core is needed for the core, belly and back section (titled Fire Bird on the DVD). In this section she moves through a sequence over and over quite quickly. I suggest going at your own pace until you've built up the core strength to keep up with her.

The workout is broken into 6 sections (as below). Each section is named after a ballet (as I have no interest in watching ballets I cannot attest to whether or not the moves are what you would find in the actual ballet routine) and focusses on certain areas of the body. With that said, even when you are working on one section of the body, the moves usually all involve the core and holding it in correctly. The workout run time is about 60 minutes.

1. Swan Lake: Arms (Warm up ) 10 mins
2. Fire Bird: Core, Belly and back 10 mins
3. Nutcracker: Hips, Butt and Inner Thighs 15 mins
4. Coppelia: Ankles and feet 16 mins
5. Cinderella: Dance Expression 7 mins
6. Sleeping Beauty: Stretch and relax 6 mins

Nicky works out alone in what looks like a loft or barn that's been converted. Very nice looking set. Nicky instructs the workout via voiceover which I usually dislike - and this is one of those occasions where I dislike the voice over. Her cueing is off at times so you have to keep your eyes glued to the tv - or risk having to press rewind several times. For example on one occasion when you are on all fours working one leg, I am happily working away on the one leg until she moves onto another move and I then realise she's switched to the second leg at some point without mentioning it. Frustrating! Also her breathing cues seem a bit off - you do a move lying on one side and she'll cue breathing out on the exertion but when you do the same move on the other side she tells you to breathe out but not on the exertion! Maybe it's just me. Ellen Barrett DVDs are excellent for toning (her workouts are a fusion of methods and combine strength, stretch, cardio, dance, yoga and pilates) and her cues for breathing and the next move are always spot on.

The stretch and relaxation section at the end is on the short side and doesn't feel anywhere near as good as Jennifer Galardi's stretch session at the end of Ballet Body.

The music is quite nice during the workout but the music that plays whenever you are on the main menu is quite depressing to me!

All in all, it is a good workout particularly for toning the legs and core. It is relaxing in terms of the music but you will be worked relatively hard during the leg focussed routines. On the scale of difficulty 1 being easy and 10 being very hard I would rate this a 4 to 4.5. I work out 6-7 days a week but as I find the cueing (or lack there of) rather annoying - plus I don't want to end up with pot belly due to the strange breathing directions - I will add this DVD to my workout rotation but use it only once or twice a month.",1381104000,61,3121,4.174418604651163
5734633,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"I really don't enjoy working out, so I thought I'd keep myself interested by trying new things (bellydancing fitness DVDs, dance fitness DVDs, pilates, yoga, etc.). I previously used the Ballet Beautiful series, and although I still love it, I feel like it's more of a workout and less of a dance experience.

When I started this DVD, I started with the first option: Swan Lake Arms. I was worried it would be 10 minutes of grueling arm workouts, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was more of a stretch in combination with the arm movements. Nicky moves quickly through the routine, and I enjoyed the pace because 10 minutes passed as if it was nothing! I decided to do a few more sections from the DVD, and I really felt like I was dancing, not working out. The movements were so fluid that it felt effortless. At the end of the workout, I was certainly out of breath, but I wasn't aching anywhere like I usually do after using other fitness DVDs. I was a bit worried that maybe I hadn't worked my muscles as hard as I should have.

Then the next day arrived. My abdominal muscles were aching in that good, you-really-did-an-amazing-workout-yesterday sort of way.

I'm really looking forward to using this routine regularly, as it makes working out easy and fun. I'd say if you enjoy dance, or if you want to find a fitness video that makes exercise fun and easy, you'll probably want to check this out. Thanks Nicky!",1378857600,95,1431,4.538759689922481
5734634,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"I wanted this video based on certain ballet moves and streches I am trying to learn.  I do not have a barre and with Nicky's work out there is no need for one. You still recieve maximum results with minimum impact.

When I was searching for the video I contacted a company in the UK, not thinking she was going to respond back to me, but I was surprised. Nicky contacted me the very next day which made it even more impactful.  The personal touch inspired me to purchase the video.

And I am glad I did.  I love Nicky.  She is so graceful.",1372636800,35,539,4.134615384615385
5734635,2,B00CQ8NXY4,"While I appreciate being able to work out to something other than the THUD-THUD-THUD of most popular music, there is little else about this particular workout video to set it apart from dozens of others.

The exercises are pretty standard old-school calisthenics, which in itself isn't a bad thing. The newer workouts have drifted rather far away from some of the more tried-and-true classics. However, McGinty does little to engage the viewer in terms of smiles, eye contact or friendly patter. She doesn't even offer a great deal in the way of instruction in proper technique, so you sort of have to guess and hope you guessed correctly.

Further, as another reviewer has noted, her voiceover cueing is very inaccurate and misleading, making these relatively simple exercises extremely difficult to follow. I've used this video only once because I got tired of following what I thought were her instructions (which often had me facing away from the screen), looking up at the screen and realizing she and I were doing two totally different things, and having to rewind and start over. Not worth the effort. There are far better ballet workouts than this one.",1463356800,8,1160,4.974226804123711
5734636,5,B00CQ8NXY4,"After no exercise for 5 years and no ballet for 28 years, this is a good exercise to slowly back to routine. Each set can be done separately. Good for muscle tone. Good for old ladies. Not good for people with knees problem for one part of the exercise. I'm still in my 3rd day and I can only do 3 sets from the 6 sets at a time. It's better than not doing anything. I started sweating after one and a half set.",1462924800,5,411,3.9047619047619047

5734639,4,B00CQ8NXY4,"good exercises. the intensity was not as I had hoped. I wanted a very intense workout. overall, good dvd and easy to understand",1458864000,,127,4.565217391304348
5734640,3,B00CQ8NXY4,"NOTE:  I received this DVD as part of a set to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews.

British native Nicky McGinty had a background as a dancer and choreographer before she trained in India to become a certified yoga instructor.  She has studied in various styles of yoga, includin  Kundalini, Ashtanga, Jivamukti, and Vinyasa Flow.  In this DVD, McGlinty instructs alone in a large indoor studio via voiceover.  Although the DVD case says that there are six 10-minute routines, the lengths of the practices actually vary more significantly as noted on the Main Menu:

Play All (60 mins.)
Swan Lake: Arms (10 mins.)
Firebird: Core, Belly and Back (10 mins.)
The Nutcracker: Hips, Butt and Inner Thighs (15 mins.)
Coppelia: Legs, Ankles and Feet (16 mins.)
Cinderella/Dance Expression (7 mins.)
Sleeping Beauty: Stretch and Relax (6 mins.)

By the title, I expected the first section to be an arms workout; instead it is more of a gentle warm-up, with some arms moves (arm circles, floor dips, and ""press ups"" aka push-ups) thrown in for approximately the final three minutes.  The core segment includes pelvic tilts, bicycles, scissors, seated dips, full situps, side twists, more push-ups (plank) with knee dips, locust/swimming, and cat/cow.  For the Nutcracker, McGlinty begins working on all-fours for a series of hydrant-style leg lifts.  She also performs a side-lying series for the inner thighs, including lifts and bicycles.  The next section is standing and uses a chair for work from a ballet first position as well as balance work.  For the Cinderella routine, many of the moves are similar, but they are more free-flowing and performed without use of the chair.  There are also additional exercises such as arabesque, attitude, pli&eacute;s, relev&eacute;s, slow knees, and sways.  For the final stretch, McGlinty starts standing in a crouch and then moves into cat/cow stretches.  She finishes with lying hamstring work and a brief final stretch.

I generally enjoy ballet workouts, but this one felt too uneven to me--sometimes more like Pilates, sometimes too slow, etc.  McGlinty is pleasant enough and instructs well; I simply did not click with her in this workout.",1458000000,,2201,5.152112676056338

I deal with chronic pain and several old injuries and for years have not been able to find an exercise program that didn't end up flaring up my chronic pain.

I love the background music and the set and I love that it feels like, even ungraceful me, can dance such a beautiful form of art all while getting more fit and toned!

I have had knee surgery and this workout doesn't bother my knees at all. I have a bad wrist, but with the elbows on the floor modification I have no problems making adjustments. I am NOT a dancer and primarily run for my fitness, so this is a great addition to my cross-training.
