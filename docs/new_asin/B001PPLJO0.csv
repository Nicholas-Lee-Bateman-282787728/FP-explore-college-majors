8334140,4,B001PPLJO0,"This video was informative and the entomologist was very enthusiastic. Not a huge variety of insects were covered, but that was to be expected as there are so many different species. My son (10yrs) really enjoyed this though.",1471305600,,225,4.947368421052632

8334147,5,B001PPLJO0,"""The World's Biggest and Baddest Bugs""  not only showcases big bugs, but also other bugs like ants, spiders, and bees.  It runs about 87 minutes, so it is a long look at bugs.  I thought it was going to be all about bugs, but the entomologist, Ruud Kleinpaste, sidetracks into other related subjects like insect oxygen and praying mantis kung fu which are interesting and sumo wrestling which is less interesting.  There are closeups of some insects, which I like.  What I really wanted was more close-ups.

Don't feel like you have to watch the whole video.  We're just looking at bugs here.  I personally suggest that you just look at the bugs you want to examine.

Here's a list of some of the big bugs covered by Mr. Kleinpaste.

Giant Cockroach
Helicopter Damselfly
Praying Mantis
Weta
Centipede
Leaf Insect
Stick Insect
Goliath Spider
Hercules Beetle

Other bugs include the following.

Stinkbug
Bombardier Beetle
Army Ants
Bullet Ant
Bark Scorpion
Black Widow Spider
Funnel-Web Spider
Mosquitoes
Africanized Honey Bees (Killer-Bees)

Guess how many times Mr. Kleinpaste gets stung by the bees?",1316476800,3,1100,5.011049723756906
8334148,4,B001PPLJO0,"This appears to be longer and have more video than what I have seen in broadcast versions. Which is fine. But for our kids it made it extra long. Quality isn't really great for BluRay, but better than DVD and the price was right when I bought it. If you like the broadcast version, just be aware that this is significantly longer. This can be good and bad.",1310515200,3,356,4.25
