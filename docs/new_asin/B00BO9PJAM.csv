5661768,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Louise Palanker put together an insightful and realistic look at the 60's family band, The Cowsills, who were the inspiration for the hit TV show ""The Partridge Family."" This is a must-see for any Cowsill fan, or for anyone who grew up in the 60's. While the children smiled and charmed the audiences with such delightful hits as ""The Rain, the Park, and Other Things,"" behind-the-scenes, they had to deal with their controlling, abusive father. Their story is a bittersweet rags-to-riches-to-rags one, and a testament to the determined spirit of the talented siblings to rise above their past.",1362614400,6,594,5.071428571428571
5661769,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Well rounded documentary with terrific footage of this underrated 70's band.  What happened behind the scenes is always fascinating and sometimes tragic, but the ups are what really move this story along.  I have new respect for The Cowsills",1362614400,3,241,5.153846153846154
5661770,5,B00BO9PJAM,Amazing story of an amazing band and family.  Thanks to Louise for all the hard work and the The Cowsills for all they gave for their whole lives.,1362614400,2,146,4.214285714285714
5661771,4,B00BO9PJAM,"I had never heard of these guys until David Cassidy died. I looked them up and have been hooked ever since. Its good for all of us to tell our stories and hopefully expose whatever abuses were done to us to help the next generation.

This was well written. I enjoyed it.",1513296000,3,270,4.1923076923076925
5661772,5,B00BO9PJAM,I love the Cowsills.  A sad documentary.,1513123200,,40,4.714285714285714
5661773,5,B00BO9PJAM,Brutally honest and at times difficult to watch.  It moved me to tears to learn of the abuse endured by talented young kids who gave so much joy to my generation.  And their long and difficult recovery coming to terms with their abusive father.,1513123200,,244,4.5227272727272725
5661774,5,B00BO9PJAM,Fantastic story. I had no idea the pain they went through. Flower girl was my favorite song in my teen years..Please watch this film ,1511740800,,133,4.541666666666667
5661775,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Good documentary, done by the family. Doesn't pull all punches (although you get a sense that life with Bud was much worse than they portray). This band was formative for those of us at that age. Happy, positive, family oriented in a period where so many things in the country were dark (Vietnam war, youth in the streets, the sometime violent push back by many against racism, the assassination of Kennedy). Harmonies were awesome.... great to see the clips.",1511654400,2,459,4.822784810126582

5661779,5,B00BO9PJAM,"It goes to show that what you see on the surface is not necessarily what's going on underneath, especially in show biz.  My heart goes out to them for having such an abusive father. I didn't know they were the real life inspiration for the Partridge Family, which was one of my FAVORITE shows growing up, so WOW, they are the real deal. Bless all of them.",1504051200,,355,4.298507462686567
5661780,5,B00BO9PJAM,"I was born in 74, yet recall seeing their albums in thrift shops years later. Funny, I always thought how they looked like, ""The Partridge Family"". Never knowing they were the original concept. I can honestly say they are talented. Over the years, I've heard their music pop up and do enjoy it. My mother actually remembers them and will enjoy this movie as much as I have.",1503792000,4,373,4.5
5661781,4,B00BO9PJAM,Really interesting and well done.  Sad.  I think I'd be very bitter for many reasons.  Wishing them the best.  So talented.,1503446400,,123,4.714285714285714
5661782,5,B00BO9PJAM,Phenomenal story of one of the most underrated bands of all time.  I was born in 1959 and in the late 60's I was too young for hard rock.  I loved the pop harmonies of the Cowsills and so wanted to be just like them.  This is a touching and many times sad and distressing story but it makes them that much more real.  And just this past Friday I was able to mark one item off my bucket list...I saw the Cowsills LIVE as part of the Happy Together Tour when they came to Hot Springs!  They sounded spectacular.  Wished they would have been the whole concert.,1503273600,4,557,4.111111111111111
5661783,2,B00BO9PJAM,"love the music, but alot of origin story is left out as it rapidly skips ahead to become not much more than a whine fest. The end shows the siblings accepting each other for who they are, but that's only after everyone has had a chance to tell their horror story of how their parents ruined their lives.
ON the bright side, you won't be inspired to get into the music industry",1502928000,,376,4.236111111111111
5661784,4,B00BO9PJAM,"You don't have to be a big fan of their music to appreciate this honest portrayal of siblings growing up in a large, musical family. The 60s and 70s had a lot of large families -- both on television and in real life, and for those of us who grew up in one, we can relate to so much of this film. It is true, to a great extent, siblings raise each other in large families, and those bonds can be greater than the parent-child bond. I enjoyed this movie very much!",1502755200,,462,4.032608695652174
5661785,5,B00BO9PJAM,truly excellent documentary.  left me moved . . . made me care.  hat talent!,1502150400,,76,4.357142857142857
5661786,4,B00BO9PJAM,"'m the same age as Susan, and I went right back to being a kid watching them on Saturday music shows, listening to AM radio.  They were so talented, and I always wondered what happened to them. They just disappeared. Today's kids are more empowered than we were, and can't fathom kowtowing to Authoritarianism, but it was a very different era, and still, I remember 1969 as a great year to be a kid.  Sure, Vietnam was raging and civil rights were struggling, but our older brothers and sisters were shining klieg lights on all that hypocrisy.  We went to the moon.  The future seemed bright.  Well, fast forward 5 decades and...I wonder what Bill's musical output could have sounded like, given different circumstances. Haunting, and ultimately uplifting in this family's love for each other.",1502064000,2,793,4.844444444444444
5661787,3,B00BO9PJAM,"Just OK, I've seen better band bios.  Was good to find out what happened.  I very much remember them and they were HUGE for a short time.  They really had the *pop* sound of the 60s.  What this film did not do, and I wish it had, was to tell how much they actually were allowed to play/sing on their albums.  They allude to not playing in one anecdote, but if you aren't looking for it, you might miss it.  I imagine they just came in to sing (with help, perhaps) after studio musicians laid down the tracks.  Unlike some other made-for-TV groups, they had a ton of talent, so were able to back it up live.  It is a shame that their father was an angry, alcoholic pedophile (using alcohol to deal with his desires, which only caused him to lose whatever control he tried to exert over himself).  A good watch if you remember them.  If you don't, then it is probably hard to 'get'!",1501804800,,880,4.2155688622754495
5661788,5,B00BO9PJAM,"How interesting to hear the story of The Cowsills. It feels good to hear and remember the great songs they produced, but especially to hear from them personally what their lives were like. They are amazingly talented and I enjoyed seeing how much they love and respect each other after all of it.",1501200000,,296,4.60377358490566
5661789,5,B00BO9PJAM,"What an excellent documentary! I loved the Cowsills when I was a kid...I was born in 1963...(I remember hearing ""Hair"" on every radio station that we tuned into, in every state, while on a family road trip from Washington to Missouri) and ""The Rain, The Park, & Other Things"" remains a favorite song of mine to this day. I loved it that a little girl that was my age was in a band!

I recall hearing of Barry's disappearance during Katrina and was saddened by his death, but I had no idea that Bill died too.

It's disheartening and sickening to discover that their father was so abusive. The Cowsills were so talented, only to be shot down by their father.

But I found myself tapping my feet and singing along while I watched this movie. If you love their music, as I do, you will enjoy this movie.",1500940800,2,800,4.355704697986577
5661790,5,B00BO9PJAM,"As a child I loved the Cowsills and even though I didn't know them personally, I was very proud that kids like me....made it (The Cowsills).
Then after a couple good songs, it was like they vanished. I loved the Cowsills Story-the adult children were honest and very down to earth. My mother once watched Bud Cowsill doing an interview and stated to me,"" Well we all know who wears the pants in that family..big time."" As a kid, I didn't know what she was talking about, but after watching this...now I understand. I think if Bud just step back and let the kids breathe alittle, they would of stayed famous. Truthfully I believe the kids,  that much of the money that they made was wasted on bad decisions and investments by the father. And what is truly  sad you didn't hear of the passing of Mrs. Cowsill and the 2 brothers. I give a thumbs up on this story and hope only good things will happen for this talented family.",1499385600,6,923,4.391812865497076
5661791,5,B00BO9PJAM,"I loved the movie. Both times! That uplifting joyous Spirit of the 60's all came back watching this. I clearly remember waiting for INDIAN LAKE to come on the radio. And when it did, would close my eyes and SING!! Bill Cowsill hated it, but the beautiful harmonies and the feeling of endless possibilities swept over me. And Susan was the joy filled Spiritual Center. Watching them on Ed Sullivan I fell in love with her. First crush. First girl in a group............ Too familiar story. Bad management. Hurt feelings. Should have fired the Colonel, or their dad. Like Elvis, management, or dad tried to maintain a certain image. But as I was reminded, the Cowsill's were much more! If you were a child of the 60's, I was eleven when I was first transfixed by Susan dancing to INDIAN LAKE, watch this wonderful movie!",1499385600,5,818,4.6482758620689655
5661792,5,B00BO9PJAM,Right up there among my favorite documentaries. Their personal story is beyond anything you could imagine if you followed this band as a youngster. What a shame this talent was squandered by the last person who should have been in charge.,1497571200,2,238,4.829268292682927
5661793,5,B00BO9PJAM,"What a horrifying true story of heartbreak behind the uplifting sound of America's family band. This is an eye-opener for anyone who ever envies the lives of people so relentlessly in the public eye, presented in an idyllic fashion. So sad and depressing, but the human spirit is stronger than we imagine. For me, this story was truly a horror. I sincerely hope that the person who called himself ""father"" has found the reward that he so justly deserves.",1497052800,4,454,4.7594936708860756

5661797,5,B00BO9PJAM,What a story. I was and still am a big fan of the Cowsills. You cannot be a fan and not watch this movie. Bob Cowsill does a great job of walking the viewer through it.,1490572800,,168,3.6944444444444446
5661798,1,B00BO9PJAM,"After seeing this on tv, I really wanted it, as I'm a big fan of the band. However, this dvd is of poor quality, and I've been tempted to return it or just junk it. The label appears to be a pc generated one, and those do eventually peel off, and will damage your player. The menu is poorly made, and the live videos are stretched and very poor quality both audio and video. This gives the appearance of an illegal copy, and I am very disappointed. You'd be better off recording it from tv.",1490486400,,490,4.168421052631579

Every time I see or hear them I am amazed at their talent and their courage and fortitude. I highly recommend this documentary. You not only get to hear their beautiful harmony, you will walk away wanting to hang out with them.

Thank you!",1481587200,,381,4.219178082191781

Great Band.  I listened to The Cowsills growing up.  I like their new music too.",1481328000,,156,4.703703703703703
5661804,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Another band that got screwed, and so did we. In the same controlling vein as the Beach Boys father, this poor family of extremely talented kids had it even worse. They were forced into the bubblegum mode when according to insiders, 2 of the young members were already writing great songs and they were squashed. The mom didn't even want to be in the band.  The vocal harmonies were like watching 2 Bee Gees vocal groups on the same stage. They could have been so much more. This documentary is really worth watching because if you weren't a fan before, (I wasn't) you will be after watching it.",1481155200,4,595,4.5092592592592595

5661813,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Did you grow up during the sixties?  If so you simply must see this documentary.  Oh, how I love the time.  It was, perhaps, the most musically magical period in all of modern time.  So many years later I must say I remember The Coswills.  But, I hardly knew them.  They blipped on the screen for a moment and then they were gone.  What happened?  This documentary tells the story.  It isn't the story you might think.  This family was the real deal.  They weren't the kids picked out to represent a musical juggernaut of a family.  They were the real deal.  So, what happened?  Well, it started with the patriarch being horribly divisive, and since he held the keys to the kingdom, he crushed it.  But, there's much  more.  The family didn't just fade into pop oblivion.  This was a family and it kept on being brothers and sister.  They reemerged and in that there is  a story.  The family that had it all, lost it all, and became the absolute blueprint for The Partridge Family kept breathing and living  This is their story and it deserves another look.  Thank goodness a filmmaker thought the same.  I can't tell you how much this story has moved me.  It's sad and it's also uplifting all in the same.  If you grew up when The Cowslips were a blip on the radar you simply must see this film.  It's a survivor's story and it's a celebration of what family really means. The music is a huge bonus.  Please see this film if you were born in a time when pop music defined so much.  You'll be richer for it.",1471996800,,1507,4.320143884892087

Incredible music, but above all, a touching, inspiring story of the strength of sibling love, and the power of family ties, individual strength, and resilience.  Long Live the Cowsills!!!! If you ever loved their music - or even if you haven't a clue who they are - treat yourself to this engrossing film. Thanks to the filmmakers and The Cowsills for sharing their stories with us.

5661823,5,B00BO9PJAM,"An excellent documentary covering the rise and fall of this late 60s family band. Most Americans living in the late 60s and early 70s will remember the Cowsills, but  don't know what happened after they shot to stardom.  Most people probably didn't realize how insanely talented each member of this band is and was.. Even though we have heard this kind of story before, complete with a father who had no idea how to love his family and in the end, ended up killing the band, The filmmakers give a great insight to this all -American family and their battles with addiction and lack of a loving father' and most importantly their survival.  The film barely hits on Barbara Cowsill, the mother, and her plight in all of this, but this film is more about the kids journey and shows how much parenting has changed in 50 years but not the family dynamic.",1465257600,,849,4.5359477124183005

Although the intention may have been to present a truly spontaneous video I found this format difficult to follow.

5661868,5,B00BO9PJAM,A very interesting trip down memory lane.  I was fascinated by the Cowsills story.  I knew there were family issues but not to the extent shown in this documentary.  I was a big fan of The Cowsills back in the late '60s and this story tells of how they started and ended so fast.  I really enjoyed this.,1429488000,,303,4.172413793103448

5661870,4,B00BO9PJAM,"When I was 12 years old, I was introduced to the music of the Cowsills.  I was amazed at just how talented this group was, as I enjoy good harmony (from barbershop quartets to music of groups like the Beach Boys and Four Seasons).  Also, being an only child whose mother was accepted into the Julliard School of Music but chose not to attend, I was intrigued about a single family who was so talented and using its talents.  These two facts made me an almost instant fan of the Cowsills.  But as time went on, I heard less and less about them, and after going off to college in 1973 and entering adulthood, I rarely gave them a thought.  Then one day recently, I came across information about the Cowsills almost randomly after performing a Google search, so I decided to see if I could uncover information about them.  I read about them on Wikipedia, and found a link to this video.

After reading about all the hardships the Cowsills endured over the years, I felt I had to watch this video.  It is very well-done, and covers the story of this family both objectively and sensitively.  This group was a national sensation in the early sixties, and then fell into obscurity only a few years later.  The video grabs you from the beginning, as it shows Bob Cowsill setting up for a bar room gig, and telling the audience that ""I once had four hit songs"".  It's obvious the audience had no clue about this.  The video then goes back to the sixties and tracks the group's rise to stardom, and subsequent fall, in detail.  It shows how Bud Cowsill, the patriarch of the family, ruled with an iron hand and brought his family down with a series of bad decisions.  I don't want to say too much, but if you remember the Cowsills at all, I'm sure you'll find this video gripping and worth watching.",1427500800,12,1790,4.4176829268292686

The exceptional work by Louise Palanker brought it all together-the good,  the sad and the ugly reality of having it all andv then losing it all by ""forces beyond your control"" (Daddy dearest). The Cowsills may have scattered and faded but NOT in the hearts of their loyal fans. Louise brought them back to life ""In the media sense"" and bravo to her!

5661877,5,B00BO9PJAM,"The first time I ever heard The Cowsills was back in the late 1980s when my parents bought one of those 1960s compilation cassette tapes from Silver Eagle Records (remember them?) and their hit song ""The Rain, The Park & Other Things"" was on one of them.  I LOVED the song and many years later when I saw the movie ""Dumb & Dumber"" I INSTANTLY recognized it although it was misidentified by some as ""The Flower Girl Song"".  Needless to say, I found out about the history of the band and how they were the inspiration for TV's ""The Partridge Family"", but I admittedly wasn't really a fan of theirs or their music until a few years ago when I watched this documentary on Showtime.

Watching it, I gained so much respect for The Cowsills as a band AND as a family.  Sadly, I knew little about their story and history and, unfortunately, there wasn't a whole lot to go by until this documentary.  Some of it was probably because of the personal issues that went on behind-the-scenes with their father as well as some of the children's struggles with alcohol and drug abuse.  What I find to be illuminating and inspirational about this family is that, in spite of all of the years of abuse and personal struggles, each and every one of the kids have such a deep and abiding love for one another and they are as close now as they have ever been.  No doubt in large part because of the fact that they share a common and unfortunate bond of growing up with a father who ran a very tight ship (no pun intended).

The Cowsills have been perceived over the years by some as a bubblegum pop band with little substance, but I VEHEMENTLY disagree with this perception and here's why: they play their own music and pass the ultimate test by proving that they can perform great live as a band, they took a song in ""Indian Lake"" which was, by Bill Cowsill's account, a crappy demo and they turned it into not just a damn good song, but one that was unique and distinctively Cowsills-esque, if there is such a word, they took the song ""Hair"" and were able to not just make it unique and distinctive of their own sound, but managed to shed their squeaky-clean family image and break free from the perception which frankly didn't hold a lot of merit.  Not only can they play their own instruments and do it well, but they can sing like angels and have some of the best harmonies that I have EVER heard.  Even now, they still sound great and IMHO better than ever!

The first thing that I did after watching this documentary was buy a Cowsills CD and started listening to their songs.  I was so inspired and taken by their story, but more than anything their music, and if this documentary and their story that is told in 90 minutes can make a fan out of me, then I know full well that I am not alone.  Moreover, I even watched the extra, additional footage on Amazon because I wanted even more and I felt like these people were like new friends and acquaintances that I had just met.  Many times it felt awkward and painful to listen to them talk about the pain and abuse they have suffered individually and collectively over the years.  No child should EVER have to endure what Bill, Bob, Richard, Barry, John, Paul and Susan had to experience.  I am just overwhelmed and moved at how strong and confident they are as a family today and that is inspirational.  Thank you for the music and memories and God bless Bill, Barry, Richard and Mrs. Cowsill!",1420416000,8,3430,4.401898734177215

5661890,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Being 52 years old I remember the Cowsills and listening to their music and then again later on when oldies formats would play their song I always thought to myself what a bunch of goody too shoes. How incredibly wrong I was. They were and still are very talented musicians who were if handled correctly back then would have been house hold names and in everyones music collections as serious artist instead they were relegated to one hit wonder status and has-beens.
They are still performing today as Cowsills and other groups as a nostalgic acts playing their hits from then and others. What might have been will never really be known to anyone but God, because they were a dysfunctional family with an abusive father and Im assuming the mother was not strong enough to stop the abuse. They could have been superstars, but were so badly managed by their abusive father that he ruined any chance that could have happened.
I knew when I began watching this film that this would be the case, because it always is the case time and time again when you see these famous people and wish you too could have their fortunes. Fact is these people had to live a nightmare with some fun times between. Poor Susan when she started talking about her father trying to molest here was just the straw that broke the camels back. You just knew that this was going to be part of the story because it always is when abusive parents are to blame. I wonder sometimes how this world is so screwed up and looking at this documentary shows why.
Im glad they have found solace and peace now and Im so sorry for the 2 brother who died way too young. But, isn't that always the case in situations like this? I hope the money that I spent on this film is going towards their pockets. It was worth every cent. I was honored that you shared your story with the rest of us.",1415318400,3,1844,4.410557184750733

Susan Cowsill was even sexually abused by him. They all managed to survive, but, they will endure emotional pain for the rest of their lives. Hopefully, when it becomes their time and they are gone, they will no longer feel the degradation that one carries life long from abuse by a parent who is supposed to love you. Their mother, Richard, and Barry have already passed. While watching the survivors, now in their 50's or 60's in age, it is easy to see that they are still in pain trying to understand and find a way to put the pain behind them. I wanted to reach out and help them. Of course I can't. Almost 30 years after their father's death the survivors are still in pain. Amazing that sweet music like ""the flower girl"" and ""Some Good Years"" could come out of that situation.",1414281600,4,926,4.452941176470588
5661893,5,B00BO9PJAM,"I remember The Cowsills as a novelty pop-group during the age of enduring bands such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Yardbirds, Who, and Doors.  The clean-cut Cowsills were the darlings of teeny-boppers and older generations, but they weren't taken seriously by young fans of rock music.

This documentary was a revelation.  First, I never had any idea that the Cowsill brothers were so talented.  I enjoyed watching and hearing them play musical instruments so well, and Bill's strong lead voice, and the nice harmonies, were excellent.  Second, it's sad to learn the story behind their evolution -- from a solid foursome, with limited success, to a ""bubblegum"" group featuring Mom and baby sister, with a meteoric rise and fall.

If Bud had let the four brothers pursue their own path, would they have become famous?  They were already popular throughout southeastern New England, and they had a recording contract and some standing gigs.  We'll never know whether that would have been the end of the road or the start of fame.  We do know that the changes and group additions, forced by Bud, altered the Cowsills's course forever.

Isn't it interesting that the ""Partridge Family"" mother was a widow, with no domineering husband/father in the picture?",1414108800,2,1254,5.043689320388349

5661901,5,B00BO9PJAM,"If you love music, popular music, if you 'remember the '60's', ~or if you find the entire era fascinating, then you MUST see(absolutely) must see Family Band: The Cowsills Story. This is real, raw, un-varnished, un-wrapped family history OUTSIDE of the candy wrapping.
  Here you'll be invited to catch some long-sought-after glimpses of events that played-out before any of them (and most of us) had the context or perspective necessary for this conversation about them to take place HERE, in the next century. The circle of their friends and professional colleagues, the parade of luminaries and true celebrities of the recording industry, (even Hollywood, [EVEN Vaudeville]) have here their orbits that encompassed this group's incredible story. Here, you'll discover that the Cowsill's pioneering music-video 'Hair',(their last, big, solid-gold hit together), was the industry legend Carl Reiner's inspired idea. (WHO KNEW!) And with their 'Hair' flying in the face of MGM record co. execs. who hated it, they sold more than two and a half million copies after only the first radio broadcast from WLS in Chicago. THIS, folks, is what radio legend Paul Harvey meant by ""..the REST of the story.."".
  As with all true stories, you will have a chance to buckle-up and ride-out the bumpy parts of memory lane*.
They do not sugar-coat it. American success-stories (especially those of music and show business), are not nursery
rhymes for children. (~no matter how many of them are in it). But the music they have written and recorded since
their early days will astound you. It is magnificently inspired and proof of their love for each other. They are truly amazing musicians and their harmonies are the gold standard for every fan of the family-band.
  *There are some casualties here, as with any family. And the more you liked them as a child yourself, the
more shocked and stunned you must prepare yourself to be. We were all children once. If you loved them then, and
havn't followed or kept-up, this will hurt. The good news is (they're the Cowsills). Their music heals now.
  Try some. and buy some. It's good for ya. It's good for everybody. Love 'em then, love them now.",1405296000,6,2179,4.983471074380165
5661902,4,B00BO9PJAM,"There was a ""Kids in the Hall"" sketch about a garage band in which one member's dad insisted on being their manager, professing to ""know a little something about the rock 'n' roll business"" by virtue of being an insurance salesman. It seems Navy veteran Bud Cowsill had a similar delusion. Among the many blunt revelations and poignant insights in the very watchable ""Family Band"" comes when Bob Cowsill says people in show business ""only ever wanted to work with us once,"" due to Bud's overbearing nature and tendency to alienate those whose support might have helped prolong the group's career.

On one hand, you can't fault the man for hard-nosed negotiating tactics, but if in the end you lose out completely -- and predictably -- to entertainment giants like Ed Sullivan, ABC and the seemingly ever-supportive New York music industry pros interviewed in the doc, you really only have yourself to blame. And his obviously horrid mismanagement of the money that clearly was made by this hard-working, relentlessly touring band is a disgrace. The sad irony is that it was Bud's kids' immense and still-evident talent that even allowed the dream (his, theirs or both) to materialize. And then when it did, lots of showbiz types only wanted the elemental gimmick of a family unit, nothing more. Still, you have to wonder what might have been if Daddy Dearest could have managed to keep his boozing at bay, and his tongue, ego (and fists) in check just enough to let the smart, experienced people run things.

That wasn't to be, of course, and so we're left with this doc, which shows the siblings admirably trying to examine the fragments of their alternately strange and intense childhood. Personally, I find the Cowsills' story so compelling that a lot of the exposition in the movie got to feel dull or dragged-out (did we really need that much Hurricane Katrina news footage?) when what might have livened things up was some insights from the Cowsill ""kids"" into how Barbara, the mother, coped with all the stress. For someone who was reportedly so shy and averse to the stage, why did she soldier on even after her oldest son was booted from the group? Was the family that much of a business by then that it was unthinkable to stop? I'm not saying she should have, just that I would have liked to hear something about the thinking of ""Mini-Mom,"" who died quite young and, of course, isn't here to speak for herself (same goes for her domineering husband). As it was, the leaden commentary from the aunts showed a tendency of families in the '50s and '60s to look the other way when evidence of abuse, alcoholism and various improprieties emerged. And that reinforces an underlying theme in the movie that behind many a pretty facade is something else entirely.",1404950400,5,2765,4.7824267782426775

I always figured the old man for a real piece of work, even when I was a kid, and it was heartbreaking to find he was even worse than I could have imagined. They were immensely talented and without the iron-fist of the old man who knows how far they might have gone. The stories of how life unraveled for them was truly compelling. I knew some of Bill's story, but not the true extent of the drug addiction and total downward spiral. I remember Dick being in Vietnam, but didn't know the story about how he ended up in the military at a time when no sane parent would have wanted their child in any branch, and his drug addiction problems when he came home. Barry's story was maybe the saddest of all. Truly a man-child who was never able to find his way.

I don't want to give everything away but they truly had dysfunctional parents.  They could have been bigger and more popular and even richer if not for the mistakes of the father.  But as adult children, I think their problems made them closer and it's interesting to hear them talk to each other.  When you hear their song ""Some Good Years"", it is clear that they made it through, and can even look at the past with fondness.  I watched this three times which is rare for me.",1401753600,3,649,4.262295081967213
5661911,4,B00BO9PJAM,"Apparently the interviews were divided between Bob Cowsill and the director.  Bob may've been too close to his sibllngs to be objective enough to go deep into certain subjects (the family grew up learning not to ask questions, which may be why they still don't know the answers to what happened in their childhood and have to be interviewed by Bob to find out) and I get the feeling the director didn't make up for it.  I saw a radio interview with Paul Cowsill and he gave me additional, interesting info that this documentary didn't, which was 7 years in the making.  For example, he said that not only did father Bud Cowsill try to rape Susan from a young age but his sisters in law and nieces as well.  The latter parts were not in the documentary.  Also, I read elsewhere that shortly before he died, father Bud Cowsill visited each of his children and gave them $1000.  He asked Bob, ""Are you prejudiced?""  ""Of course not, Dad!""  ""Well, then at least I did one thing right.""  It's not mentioned here.

However, there is a lot of good stuff, like the fact that mother Barbara Cowsill was so racked with guilt over not stepping in when her husband beat their children that she was in psychotherapy up until the day she died.  Many great music clips (Susan was adorable as a youngster and quite a dancer, which I wish they'd discussed).  Obviously a very talented family who actually played on their own records.  How can you see little Paul drumming up a storm on one of those TV shows and not be impressed (he now tours with the Beach Boys)?

They skip over the '89 reunion (you can see clips of them on youtube as they made the rounds to many talk shows; I remember a People Magazine article around the time).  As I say, incomplete for all the time they were interviewed.

It's heartbreaking to see former leader Bill Cowsill being interviewed because from the timing, he must've died within a month or two of it.  He's winded from various ailments and is unrecognizable from his usual skinny, high cheek-boned self.  The band still sounds great today even with only 3 of them performing together.  Check out youtube for how they sound doing their old hits and their version of the Partridge Family's ""I Think I Love You.""  Wow!",1400803200,3,2234,4.523690773067331

Great trivia including how ""Hair"" became a surprise hit, why they didn't like ""Indian Lake"" being foisted upon them; their parents, and also the tragedy of losing two of them in a short period of time. Should ""mom"" have joined the band or let them alone? How about their hard-drinking father and his strictness?

But there was a downside--paternal cruelty, financial mismanagement, drugs.

Not all musicians are as candid and forthcoming as the Cowsills.  Spurred by brother Bob, still a working performer along with other family members, they lay themselves open before the cameras and tell all.

I came across it on Showtime in March 2013 and almost a year later I am still watching it.  The film, by documentary filmmaker Louise Palanker, chronicles the rise and fall of the 1960s band, family strife, and their spot in music history.  The film earned the grand prize for Audience Favorite at the 2011 Rhode Island Film Festival.  After seeing the film I became an instant fan.  I am a member of Generation X  I was born after the Cowsills initial success.  However I was so impressed by this family and this film that I was moved to purchase their music and see them multiple times in concert: Bob, Paul, & Susan Cowsill as The Cowsills, Susan in The Susan Cowsill Band, John Cowsill as the singing drummer in the touring Beach Boys.  I have also had the pleasure of meeting Bob, Paul, and Susan who are very sweet, genuine people in addition to their incredible talent.

This is more than a film about a talented rock band.  This film is about love and family  family that can withstand anything when love is there.  It is a love story with incredible music.  A few of my favorite quotes from the film sum it up well:

As an adult I look back at The Cowsills and I see different versions of it, but the version that I love and I see, and I will keep to myself, they were the most absolutely insane talented group who got taken down a s***ty path, but that doesnt change how great they were. John Cowsill

What we had and still have, and will have forever is our talent, our music, and each other.  We have our family. Bob Cowsill

It was good to see much of the clips and explanations of how the group ""evolved"". Unfortunately most of the film is comprised of the remaining Cowsills in various configurations and settings doing ""family therapy"" much like you see on those cheesy reality shows with grown up kid actors. Yes, the father was a bad guy, no question about it. This could have been made clear with a few stories told briefly rather than many of the excruciating segments that went into way too much detail. Then we see, again in various settings, the remaining Cowsills working through issues amoung themselves. All very tedious.
 Their mother doesn't get much play here either. We do hear about 100 times that they didn't want her in the band but little else. Nothing at all about her life after the band broke up or how she died.
 And if this wasn't enough you can watch the ""bonus"" CD which is more of them talking much like you saw in the film.",1389052800,3,1047,4.505263157894737

It was very interesting (and a bit sad) to learn about all the puppetry and tension going on behind the scenes.

What's bad about this documentary is that, with the exception of a few ten-second clips, it does not include any of their performances.  This is something that is usually included on most band/artist documentaries and I was disappointed to see that nothing of such was included here.  Obviously, the point of the documentary is to tell the story and it's done well... but as a fan, I still wish I could have seen some of their most famous songs performed in there entirety.",1388016000,,762,4.573529411764706

This documentary is certainly well done, and although i had heard about a lot of this stuff over the years, i did learn a few things about them.

However....let's not revise history here.  The Cowsills, even at their peak of popularity, were at best a second tier bubblegum band and not much more than a novelty act to most people.  Yes...they had a couple of hits (written by professional songwriters and played by professional session musicians in the studio) ...and yes... the boys had good harmonies when they were young... and they were all moderately talented on their chosen instruments.  But these guys were never going to be on the same level as some of the groups that they compare themselves to in this documentary, even if their tyrannical father WASN'T running the show.....and ruining everything.

 Having a wholesome ""family band"" image opened a few doors for them in the industry...for a very brief period.  But as we all know....""wholesome"" wasn't a big seller in the late sixties  (whether you were a milk drinker or not)...and these guys, including the most talented older brother, never really had the writing and playing chops to make a long term success of this group.",1386288000,3,1340,4.791304347826087

This documentary does an excellent job tracing the groups roots in Rhode Island to the top of the pop charts in the Sixties and their crash back down to earth. Bob Cowsill is the narrator and adds tremendous credibility to the story. It is great to see that the survivors, Bob, Paul, John, Susan and brother Richard (not a part of the group) have all gone on to other careers and are intact as a family. The footage of Bill, whose melodious vocals on The Rain, The Park and Other Things, will fortunately live on, is heartbreaking. The same for Barry, who battled addiction as did Bill, and was a victim of Katrina in '06. The film's last song, Some Good Years, was written by Bob Cowsill and proves that he still has the Cowsill magic.

There have been many tell it all stories of good vs. evil ,stories of how the world just sunk below so many celebrites in our life time and there are slao the successful stories of the little guy rising to the top. The Video itself is about music. Music from the late 60's. A era that of music was different then today,and the movie which is a documentary tells the story of a talented family that was mis-managed from the get-go. By a father who as you watch this was very hands on with his direction of his family's band. The interviews are great,Shirley Jones a talented actress,Artie Kornfield who help as a songwriter and  guide for th group,and many of the Cowsill family as they are today telling their story.
We also have a lot of tv footage and you can also say music video's from way back before the era of MTV. The movie tends to be a little dark at the fustration of their career has a little profamity in it also. But just sit back and this film will take you back to a era when music was fun. The creators of this fim also have footage from the Cowsills of today singing some of their old songs. Some of the family has passed since this video was released so it is sad that some of the interviews are with Cowsill family members that just passed since the video was released,I'm sure you will be taping your feet on the floor to the beat of the music as it seems music is always playing in the film,I myself had 5 brothers so I know what it is like growing up in a large family I wish I and my family were as close as this one was.

5661957,4,B00BO9PJAM,"What is not asked or answered here,is when these great kids were being brutally beaten, WHERE WAS BARBARA?
I know if my kids were being beaten I would be in there to protect and defend. We do get the idea from her sister and even herself, as she said in an interview, ""you hit them and you love them, I guess""

The lack of asking this obvious question puzzles me. The interviews are great, and my heart broke when Barry was discovered dead. And Bill, something of a genius. I cannot help wonder, if they had had real, loving and caring parents what wonderful music they would have produced.
Susan's revelations tells the viewer how brave and feisty this little girl was. On YOUTUBE there is a video of them playing at the Playboy Mansion, take the opportunity to check it out, for it really showcases their talents, particularily Susan, whose dance moves were amazing, and Barry. Also check out the tribute to Barry, very sweet and compelling.

Sorry, I got sidetracked. It is a fine film, but this question of Barbara who is not really spoken of is a mystery.
Was she just a puppet to her husbands will? I tend to think she too felt the sting of abuse, but something's said in the movie leads me to believe otherwise. While her kids were being beaten down, was she just sitting chain smoking cigarettes? No mention made, of 'we'll, mom tried too.....' Zip.

Through it all these kids show us that music saved them and I am thankful for that. For talented, seldom acknowledged, musicians this is long over due.",1375142400,3,1510,4.544117647058823

I even made our daughter watch it, who had no idea exactly who they were, other than Susan having mutual friends with us, and seeing her perform live.  But, as soon as she heard ""The Rain, The Park and Other Things"" played, she immediately recognized that timeless classic.  I'd never heard the beautiful ""Some Good Years"" before this film, and it became another instant favorite (so I bought it on Amazon!).  Thank you Cowsills for putting out this amazing film.

5661972,5,B00BO9PJAM,"The key to this remarkable history of the Cowsills comes near its conclusion, when Bob Cowsill (who narrates) says he always thought the group ""had it all, then lost it"" after their late-Sixties burst of success - but that more recently he wondered if that was really so. By then we have heard how the fortune they earned (an estimated $20 million) was gone, leaving band members with tax bills on money they never banked. We have seen how the wholesome family image devised to sell Cowsills records and concert tickets was no match for the tyranny and abuse of their father Bud, who broke the family and the band apart. After all the sensitively edited interviews and sad revelations, we understand that this was a fabulously gifted group that never ""had it all"": the Cowsills' happy image was a distortion that couldn't compete with the sitcom version it inspired (The Partridge Family), and the fortune the group made only enriched others. Even their financial success was an illusion.

What the Cowsills actually had were prodigious talents, recordings that preserved those at their peak, and devoted fans who stayed that way. The uplift at the end of what could have been a depressing story is provided by onscreen evidence that the Cowsills haven't lost any of that. What's more, the make-believe happiness of Cowsills marketing has given way to genuine family unity and devotion. All that the Cowsills appear to have lost was never real. By contrast, what they have today is true, clear-eyed, hard-won and moving to witness.

The DVD presentation of the documentary includes extended interviews with the subjects who spoke to Bob Cowsill and director Louise Palanker. Most will be of great interest to fans, though it's clear why they didn't make the final cut. (A chat with an early producer and songwriting partner is the exception; one wishes for more Q&A about Bud Cowsill's having him removed.) The quality of the source material (e.g., TV guest appearances, their own NBC special, and even some of the recent interviews) varies considerably but is never less than acceptable. Some fans will wish that more vintage performance clips were included, but those are available on the Internet and elsewhere. What this documentary offers instead is rare indeed.",1363564800,73,2267,4.994708994708994
5661973,5,B00BO9PJAM,"In the summer of 2005, I put myself on a mailing list on a club that no longer exists (what else is new). On one mailing I noticed an act by the name of The Susan Cowsill Band. Could this be the same Susan Cowsill of that family group I adored so many years ago? I looked up the Cowsills, and whoa, they had their own website, complete with a community of fans. After lurking briefly, I joined this community and was welcomed with open arms.

Just as I was getting comfortable with the first fan-driven site that I ever enjoyed, Katrina happened and all Hell broke loose. Barry, the once heart throb of a teen nation, the still heart throb of a graying nation was missing. The overwhelming support the family received from fans was amazing. We all did our part in our own way of trying to locate Barry, sometimes stepping on the emotional toes of family members in our pursuit of truth. After discovering Barry's fate, we all waited for his ""Going Home"" ceremony. Billy's health worsened. In fact on the very day of Barry's ashes being carried far and wide, but mainly into the faces and clothes of the frigid family and guests, Billy indeed past away.

This left me wondering on what happened with them in 35 years since I bought their last record? What had happened to me in those 35 years? Where are we going and where have we been? We all go through our own version of self discovering, inflicting our own pain on top of the pain already there. For me it was self-induced outrageous misfortunes. But I had triumphs as well as tragedies. I imagine the Cowsill were no exception.

Fast forward to the release of the documentary Family Band- The Cowsills Story. On its release last year to screenings at film festivals and the like, I had ants in my pants wondering where and when I could see this. The cable network Showtime came to my rescue.

I learned things I did not and could not know. For years the family was in denial, for self-preservation and self-growth. I had to remember that these were children when their fortune changed forever, both literally and figuratively. As a boy of 16 or 17 the bitterness can last forever, bitterness over what kind of band you were perceived as becoming, and then that life ending. You may not have liked it, but it was your normal. Yes they were famous, but there's still a teenage boy with normal teenage angst; having something extraordinary happen at that same time can be catastrophic. You could almost have a separate documentary on Barry alone.

Thanks should be given to the film's guiding light, Louise Palanker, who did a really fine job. It is as haunting as anything I've seen in a bio doc. Susan (my first celebrity crush) and Billy's stories alone are riveting, with Susan's story of bravado and triumph compelling. Richard's story is haunting as well and your heart goes out to his treatment by Bud, the father, and even by his siblings. It's not all gloom and doom. There is enough wonder and awe in their lives and in the film as well. There is a balance, a triumph over tragedy. It is worth viewing again and again. There is redemption among the family at the end. Who doesn't love a happy ending?",1363132800,5,3161,4.519230769230769
5661974,5,B00BO9PJAM,"I can't count how many times over the years I wondered about The Cowsills, the group I had grown to love more than any other in my adolescent years.  Time passes but little snippets of information in a newspaper would let me know something.  There was no internet.  I was amazed to find out in later years, how truly close by they were to me at times.  The age of the personal computer arrived and my first search was for...yup, the Cowsills.  I found them.  I found fans who became friends and the rest, as they say, is history.

This documentary shines light on the Cowsills, not just the band, but the people.  Their incredible journey has twists and turns, ups and downs, some tragedy, sadly, but two things have remained constant.  Their talent and them as a family.  I always identified with them coming from a family of 7 kids myself.  This documentary is a great story, the story of triumph over adversity, the story of love and the importance of family, the story of what life was really like for people we admired from afar, whose family many of us wished we had been a part of.

5661976,5,B00BO9PJAM,"About a year and a half ago I had the great good fortune to attend the World Premiere of filmmaker Louise Panenker's splendid documentary ""Family Band: The Cowsills Story"" at the 2011 Rhode Island International Film Festival in Providence. For those under the age of 50, The Cowsills were an extremely talented and highly popular family recording act hailing from Newport, Rhode Island. The band scored several hit records in the late 1960's. The Cowsills specialized in tight harmonies and began performing and recording at a very young age. The group consisted of brothers Barry, Bill, John, Bob and Paul, little sister Susan and their mom Barbara. Their metoric rise to the top of the charts was the inspiration for the hit TV show The Partridge Family. Unfortunately the demise of the group would prove to be just as dramatic. ""Family Band: The Cowsills Story"" chronicles the life and times of a family that knew both the exhilaration of success and the pain of seeing it all slip away. I thought it was a very moving film.

The driving force behind The Cowsills was their father Bud Cowsill. The boys all started singing and playing instruments at a very young age. It quickly became apparent that this group had the potential to be something very special.  Bud believed in his boys and was instrumental in getting them a recording contract.  The Cowsills had three local hits in 1966 that got the attention of the folks at M-G-M records who signed the band in early 1967.  Several months later The Cowsills released their first single for  M-G-M called ""The Rain, The Park & Other Things"" (you probably remember it as ""The Flower Girl"") which made it all the way to #2 on the Billboard charts. Over the next few months the group would also score with a pair of hits ""We Can Fly"" (#21) and ""Indian Lake"" (#10). There were appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. It seemed for all the world that The Cowsills would be a fixture on the music scene for many years to come.

But behind the scenes there was trouble brewing. To put it mildly Bud Cowsill was a tyrant. He was overbearing and abusive to his children. It was his way or the highway. The story might remind you of the saga of The Jackson Five.  Furthermore, Bud Cowsill was extremely abrasive in his dealings with record producers, record labels and booking agents.  He rubbed people the wrong way and as one of his sons points out in the film Bud was beginning to get in the way of the groups success.  People just did not want to deal with Bud.  In the spring of 1969 The Cowsills would manage one final hit record. ""Hair"" (from the rock musical of the same name) was kind of an accident.  The record company wanted nothing to do with it but after the boys brought a demo to a Chicago radio station the song took off and within a matter of weeks The Cowsills once again had a #2 hit single.  Shortly thereafter oldest son Bill and Bud had a falling out that resulted in Bud Cowsill firing his son not only from the group but as Bill tells it also from the family.  It was heartbreaking to hear Bill discuss this in the film.  The Cowsills had lost their lead singer who was the heart and soul of the group.  I don't think Bill ever got over it.  It was all down hill from there.  It has been estimated that over a three year period from 1967 to 1970 The Cowsills raked in around 20 million dollars.  To this day the members of the band have no idea what happened to most of the money.  They certainly never saw it.

""Family Band: The Cowsills Story"" goes on to document what life was like for everyone after the demise of the group.  Each went their separate ways.  It seems like Barry and Bill had the toughest time of it.  Each was haunted by drug and alcohol abuse.  Barry had moved to New Orleans just weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck in 2006.  Sadly, he was listed as ""missing"" in the aftermath of the storm.  His badly decomposed body was discovered in late December 2006.  His siblings were devastated.  Then just a few weeks later the family learned that brother Bill had passed away.  It was all too much.  Meanwhile, Bob, Susan and Paul continued to dabble in music with their own bands and would reunite and perform as ""The Cowsills"" from time-to-time.  I found  ""Family Band: The Cowsills Story"" to be a very engaging and entertaining film.  The film is certainly not all doom and gloom as Louise Panenker liberally sprinkles in lots of joyous footage of the band's performances during its peak years.  When the credits finally rolled at the conclusion of the premiere showing the audience erupted with a standing ovation.  Then Bob, Susan and Paul appeared on stage and performed several of  The Cowsills  hits.  All in all, for me this was truly a night to remember.  The Cowsills were a really big deal here in Rhode Island when I was a teenager.  I am thrilled to finally see ""Family Band: The Cowsills Story"" available on DVD.  Check it out....you won't be disappointed. Very highly recommended!",1363046400,54,5019,4.550724637681159
5661977,5,B00BO9PJAM,"The Cowsills were a household word in the late 60's - early 70's.  Everyone loved their music (although some were too cool to admit it - cough cough), and saw them as a perfectly polished hit machine, a goody-goody family band, diametrically opposed to the psychedelic movement of the time.  No one could have imagined the turmoil beneath their squeaky-clean shiny brightness.  Louise's film uncovers the deep and dark goings on of a severely dysfunctional family.  Included are interviews with guitar virtuoso Waddy Wachtel (a neighbor and friend of the band), song writer/producer/Woodstock promoter Artie Kornfeld, and other industry witnesses of the Cowsill story.  ""Family Band, The Cowsills Story"" is a fascinating and heart-wrenching account of a talented group of siblings whose father was very, very, bad.",1362614400,3,814,5.377952755905512
5661978,5,B00BO9PJAM,"An honest and inspirational story of complex personalities, family dynamics and the remaining siblings healing together as they bravely share their turbulent history and give us an inside look at the impossibly brilliant, raw talent and music making that helped them survive. Giving well-deserved credit to the musical genius of Bill Cowsill, Billy shines in interviews as he describes attempts to lead his band up the charts while facing a wall of parental abuse and subterfuge. Filled with rare photos and clips of standout performances, interviews with record producers, managers, friends and family with great narration by Bob Cowsill, this film is a must-see for music fans.",1362614400,2,679,5.355140186915888
5661979,5,B00BO9PJAM,"The Cowsills are talented, real people.  Their story is revealing, raw and gripping...and finally told in their own words.
Whether you were a fan, are a fan or never heard of them, this story is an amazing tale of survival and worth your time to view!",1362614400,6,251,4.456521739130435
5661980,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Family Band: The Cowsills Story is a poignant look at the lives of a band I grew up loving The Cowsills. Honesty is the word that comes to mind after watching the documentary that reveals the truth behind the smiles and harmonies that the Cowsills  gave us. Bob, John, Paul, Susan,  Richard, Barry and Billy all share there stories that show what the real meaning of dysfunctional family really is. Billy and Susan's words are raw and almost difficult to hear, but the truth often is. Louise did a fabulous job bringing this story to people who maybe do not even know the music of the Cowsills (which is unbelievable by the way) but will hear a story that will open your eyes and after watching will want to know the Cowsills and their music. This is a documentary beautifully done and tells a story you need to hear.",1362614400,12,817,4.476510067114094
8571893,5,B00BO9PJAM,"When I was a young kid, I had two Cowsills albums that I loved, their greatest hits and  their live album which included their huge hit single of ""Hair"".  I played them over and over again.  I loved the group's soaring harmonies... that genetic ""it"" factor that families sometimes have when they are also blessed w/ musical talent matched with drive.  The Cowsills had it.  In spades.  And then, they seemed to vanish.  With this documentary, I now know why.  If only there had been somebody able to get in there and help direct their musical careers far away from their damaged and abusive father before it was too late... and the mother who too often, seemed to have just stood by and allowed the misery and the mismanagement to continue.  But, through it all, the Cowsills, in group form or in a solo capacity, continued to make terrific music.  Their ""The Cocaine Drain"" available as a digital download on CD Baby is music truly worth owning. And 1990's ""Global"" was an inspired and joyous work.  And now they are working on a new album.  One that their fans can help support through pledgemusic.com.  (And no, I am not paid to promote the new Cd.  LOL.  Just glad to do it.)  There is also an A Capella Cd soon to be available of the Cowsills hits.  I, for one, am looking forward to hearing new music from this extraordinary group... a group, at this point, of true survivors.",1530576000,,1382,4.508064516129032
8571894,5,B00BO9PJAM,"The wife and I watched this and was shocked at what this family had gone through.  We never knew, and this movie was eye opening.  It really makes you appreciate the music all the more.  This is a great piece of music history, well worth watching.",1525996800,,247,4.326086956521739
8571895,5,B00BO9PJAM,"Fantastic documentary! Well done and put together. Very raw, real, genuine, and authentic. Thank you! The story made me tear up and smile. I was born in 1969...but my older sisters and brother had their older albums. I remember singing their songs and especially HAIR when I was 6 and 7 years old...We played it over and over and over again..lol. This doc has not only turned me on to the older Cowsill family stuff, but turned me on to all of the kids solo work from over the years. Really awesome stuff and a breathe of fresh air...REAL TALENT and REAL BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. So glad I cancelled my Netflix account and opened the Amazon Prime or I would have never seen this. LOVVVVE",1523145600,,679,4.483870967741935
8571896,3,B00BO9PJAM,This family was blessed with talent overflowing!  Sad what their parents did and it seems the children followed doing.  They do not seem to acknowledge the talent giver.  They used their talents to make a living but it seems they ended with lives destroyed and questions unanswered.  What a different story it could have been if they did what Jesus said to do with talents from the Master in Matthew 25.  Heartbreaking.,1521849600,,419,4.763888888888889
