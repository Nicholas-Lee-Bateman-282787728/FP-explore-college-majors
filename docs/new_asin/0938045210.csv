7793470,4,0938045210,"This video is another in John Du Canes's qigong series. I have all of the videos and the book that accompanies them. (See my review of John's Bliss qigong video also.)
Suffice it to say that John is one of America's best qigong instructors on video. His instructions are clear, his voice relaxing, and his manner builds confidence as you learn. Qigong is one of the best personal health arts around, and this series introduces what are known as the Five Animal Frolics, a famous exercise set. The video shows the movements clearly and John describes them in a very understandable manner. He also adds important points about your qigong practice as he teaches.
I have seen many videos from many instructors, and this series ranks with the best. I recommend them.",1074124800,6,761,4.7727272727272725
