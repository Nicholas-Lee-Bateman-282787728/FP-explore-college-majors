2161781,5,B00062IXJW,"THE SADDEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD is much more than just director Guy Maddin's exercising his talents.  Though the story of a Winnipeg bilateral amputee beer hall baroness Lady Helen Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) staging a world competition for the saddest music may sound a bit silly, watch this film for a competition to beat all competitions, a grand spectacle where a Thai flautist competes with a Mexican Ranchero band, Russians, Chinese, Serbians etc.

Add to this the personal tragedy of Lady Helen facing her lover Chester Kent (Mark McKinney) who watched while his father Dr. Fyodor Kent (David Fox) mistakenly and drunkenly amputated both of her legs after a car accident while Chester's brother Roderick (Ross McMillan) exiles himself to Serbia over the loss of his wife Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) and child, constantly playing his sad music on his cello!

All this may sound a bit over the top, but it is actually WAY over the top and happily so.  Maddin has shot the film primarily in black and white in the just-out-of-focus manner of the earliest of movies (the story, after all, takes place in the Great Depression).

But despite the emphasis on 'artiness', the story is not mere parody or wedge of surrealism: there are many cogent social comments here - enough to keep you thinking.  This film may not be for everyone, but for those who enjoy something different, it is highly recommended! Grady Harp, November 2004",1100908800,9,1437,4.941908713692946

2161786,5,B00062IXJW,"Guy Maddin just gets better and better. In this, his latest film, he's outdone himself. The fusion of content and style is so brilliant, clever, and emotional, the film has to rank as one of the best of 2004 even with the year not yet over.

Set in 1933, ""the depths of the Great Depression"", the location is Winnipeg, Canada, home of Lady Port-Huntly (Isabella Rosselini), the astoundingly wealthy beer baroness of Canada, who decides to hold a contest to select the saddest music in the world--for business reasons, of course. Among the entrants are her former lover, Chester Kent (Mark McKinney), his current lover Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros), Chester's estranged brother Roderick (Ross McMillan)--separated from Narcissa, and the men's father, Duncan (Claude Dorge). Duncan represents Canada; Chester, America; and Roderick, Serbia (of all places).

The prize is $25,000, a fortune in those days, so naturally there are entrants from all over the world--among which are Mexico, Siam, and Africa. The music is inspired, but eventually converges on the lilting popular American tune The Song is You, for which there are diverse renditions in the course of the film. The show-stopper is the version by Chester near the end, a big band production that fuses influences, in typical American fashion, from all over the world.

Familial tensions converge with unrequited love, and with the most peculiar prostheses anyone has ever seen--either in real life or on film. Lady Port-Huntly is a double amputee, and he whose reckless mistake resulted in her unfortunate current condition fashions for her a pair of legs that must be seen to be believed.

The entire film is shot using a blue-haze filter, with a faux stereopticon effect that narrows the viewing screen to that resembling what one would see from the early days of film, and with the faintest, subtlest and tiniest of lags in action-speech synchronization that makes this uncannily resonate as a work fusing a 30s setting, a pre-20s style, and a contemporary sensibility that knows how to combine these elements in the first place. This is a truly brilliant--I would even call it genius--approach to filmmaking that noone else in the known world even remotely approaches. Maddin is one of the contemporary masters of cinema and this is the proof.",1095465600,37,2304,5.087301587301587
2161822,5,B00062IXJW,"Guy Maddin's work really defies description. Words fall short. I'll try.
Script: quirky and understatedly hilarious. Performances: Quirky and understatedly hilarious. Plot: Quirky and understatedly hilarious, a parody of early black and white melodrama.
All I can say is if you're thinking of watching it, check out the trailer first, and don't go into it expecting anything very similar to anything you've ever seen before, or you're bound to be disappointed.
I feel like Maddin accomplishes effortlessly the bizarre-yet-subtle hilarity that so many other independent filmmakers I've watched my whole life try desperately to force, and fail miserably (i hesitate to name names because I know we all like different filmmakers for different reasons, but after watching Jarmusch movies all my life and thinking they were almost-but-not-quite-really-good, when I recently discovered Maddin's body of work, I quickly came to the conclusion that Jarmusch is just a poor man's Guy Maddin, and let's face it, Jarmusch hasn't had anything remotely interesting or original since Dead Man, and even that was mediocre like all his movies that went before, there I said it, although the comparison may not be really quite fair since they may not be trying to accomplish the same things/evoke the same mood).
Anyway, I personally loved this movie so much that I own it for frequent and repeated viewing (and even quote it almost constantly at odd and inappropriate moments, because it's just that fun!), but it definitely won't appeal to everybody.

2161862,5,B00062IXJW,"""If you're sad and like beer, I'm your lady.""

""In my pocket is a jar. In the jar, preserved in my own tears, is my son's heart.""

If those quotes simultaneously give you a chuckle, puzzle you, disturb you, and perhaps promote the tiniest tinge of wistfulness or longing, then Guy Maddin's hilarious, surreal, frenetic, and even slightly sad tribute to Busby Berkeley musicals, beer and international relations circa 1933 just might be the thing for you.

This is as crazy and inventive as anything Maddin has ever done, and contains most of the themes and tropes for which he has become famous (well, famous amongst connoisseurs of weird): a film language that has for the most part skipped the past 75 years of history, instead relying on silent, early sound and 2-strip Technicolor devices for its bizarre and beautiful style; disfunctional families and equally disfunctional sexual situations, with a father and son both smitten with the same woman and both partially to blame for the loss of her legs, and the son and his brother also smitten with another woman who happens to have amnesia. Add to this Maddin's typical self-deprecating love of his country (Canada) and city (Winnipeg) and a plot involving a contest to find ""the saddest music in the world"" and you've got the makings of something that only this demented director could dare to dream.

The mutilated woman happens to be beer baroness Lady Helen Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini, channeling Jean Harlow and perhaps a bit of Marlene Dietrich), and her would-be-lovers are Canadian WWI veteran Fyodor Kent (David Fox) and his estranged son Chester Kent (Mark McKinney) whose name is taken from the character played by James Cagney in the 1933 Berkeley-choreographed Footlight Parade and who also has dreams of Broadway grandeur. The two Kents had competed for Helen's hand years before and both played a part in her disfigurement; now, the legless lady of lager holds a contest in the middle of worldwide Depression, asking: which country produces the saddest music?

Not only do father and son both compete for the prize of $25,000, representing Canada and America, but another son, now representing Serbia, returns to compete as well. This is Roderick, aka Gravillo the Great (Ross McMillan), cellist extraordinaire, who has lost his wife and son (prompting the quote about tears and heart above) and who now wishes to compete for the prize and atone for Serbia's role in starting WWI. Unbeknownst to him, though, his wife Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) has not merely run off, but through amnesia and typically outrageous Maddinian coincidence is now the girlfriend of his brother.

The musical sequences are generally quite amusing, and not only offer elements of the backstage Hollywood style but also a game-show format reminiscent of cheesy TV programs like The Gong Show - presided over by the thumbs up/down of the beer baroness, and announced for the radio by a pair of effusive sportscaster types - most of the real poignancy that is actually apparent in some of the performances is undercut by all of this lunacy, as well as regular scenes of audience members enjoying the sponsor's beverage in large quantities - and regular dunkings of the winners in each one-on-one elimination contest in a huge vat of suds.

I could go on at length about the absurdities of the plot, but I think you get the drift; what's fascinating to me is how the sexual intrigues and the whole baroque strangeness of the basic situation - worldwide musical competition during the Depression, set in Winnipeg in the winter - seems to refract the Canadian sense of provincialism and dependency on America. Of course such an event could never, would never have happened, not in Winnipeg of all places - but of course when Maddin invents it, and offers it as a lens through which to filter the American fantasyworld of the backstage musical of the era, it all seems to make some kind of crazy sense; and though the film is for the most part quite funny and absurd it gains a strange kind of power as it builds towards an apocalyptic climax, and I for one found myself thinking a few sad thoughts to go with the smiles of gratitude at the masterpiece Guy Maddin had made for me.

Presented on the excellent MGM DVD with two making-of documentaries that are both solid, and three shorts:

A TRIP TO THE ORPHANAGE (2004) is a fairly disposable but pretty bit with a soprano singing a dolorous song as brief snippets of Narcissa from Saddest Music, a man in pajamas possibly sleep-walking, a young boy...pieces of a dream perhaps.

SISSY BOY SLAP PARTY (1995) ""You all better go back to the gym, you look like you're gaining weight. I gotta go to the store and buy some condoms."" A pause. ""And remember, NO SLAPPING."" says the old man to his dozen or so proteges, handsome and shirtless young sailors in some tropical surroundings, as a dreamy 30s sort of romantic melody plays. As soon as the old man and his bike are out of sight though, a homoerotic Three Stooges slap-party starts, with percussive steel-drum (played by more shirtless guys) and a droning deep string section (unseen). For a second, one of the guys in close-up looks just like Curly! Manic, crazy, hilarious.

SOMBRA DOLOROSA (2004) Reminiscent of the 2000 short THE HEART OF THE WORLD in that it seems to be trying to condense a full narrative (a woman trying to defeat death, by boxing?) into 5 minutes, I found this much more opaque than most of Maddin's other work, more reminiscent of difficult surrealist works by Lynch or Buuel - I felt I should be finding meaning, but wasn't. I'll watch it again, perhaps I'll be able to give in to the Latin American fantasy-rebirth-reincarnation motif more on a second try. In any case, like all of the director's work it's technically marvellous, beautiful and musical. I'm just not sure what else it is, if anything.

Guy Maddin just keeps growing in my estimation; alongside David Lynch, Terence Davies and Clint Eastwood, he's easily at the top of the heap of living English-language directors for me.  I think I want to move to Winnipeg and just sweep the floors or break down sets for him.

One of the very best single-disc DVDs out there.",1259452800,,6207,4.821428571428571
2161863,5,B00062IXJW,"The Saddest Music in the World (Guy Maddin, 2003)

Guy Maddin has been making films for over two decades now, quietly becoming one of Canada's most respected directors in the critical community; very fewoutside it seem aware of him, at least in America. Those few who do know of his work know it through this movie, which during its widest American release, played on twenty-five screens. There's something horrendously wrong with that. The weekend of May 30, 2004, The Saddest Music in the World cleared just over eighty-nine grand in the theaters. The same weekend, The Day After Tomorrow, one of the worst movies of 2004, made eighty-five million. It's enough to make a movie fan cry.

Set on the outskirts of Winnipeg (for the geographically challenged, Winnipeg is in the southern part of Manitoba, due north of the border between Minnesota and North Dakota) during the Great Depression, The Saddest Music in the World stars Isabella Rosselini (Blue Velvet) as Lady Helen Port-Huntley, the proprietress of a beer hall. In general, beer halls are one of the businesses that prosper during a depression, but in order to drum up business both for herself and the rest of Winnipeg, Port-Huntley comes up with a brilliant idea: offer a $25,000 prize to any artist who can come up with the saddest music in the world, in honor of the depression. Canada's own entry comes from a family very close to Port-Huntley, whose dynamic is, shall we say, a bit on the dysfunctional side. They have to be experienced to be believed.

Maddin is a connoisseur of the absurd (check out his short ""Sissy Boy Slap Party"" for all the evidence you could possibly need), but here he takes the absurdity to the next level by having everything in this movie that just looks like it's nuts having a solid reason for being there. (Wait'll you see what he does with the glass legs.) Maddin takes a screenplay from the great Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day) and turns it into a stylized, witty, brilliant film I just can't get enough of. If you haven't yet discovered Guy Maddin, this is a great place to start. **** ",1245974400,,2098,4.724043715846994

Chester Kent: Idealism and business rarely mix.
========================================

I bought this DVD at Big Lots for $3. The film was made on a budget of $3,500,000. I think it was a great deal, but some people may have been disappointed. They see the title, The Saddest Music in the World, starring Isabella Rossellini, who is a classy broad, and they see that it is about a contest to find the saddest music in the world. They envision a serious endeavor to seek out the truly saddest music in the world, and examine why it is that the saddest song can be the best song. What about that song, Gloomy Sunday that Billie Holiday sang? I hear that song was blamed for several suicides. How about Joy Division? The Smiths? Maybe find the best Emo Shoe Gazer band, from a depressing place like Manchester, or how about Winnipeg? The coldest and saddest city in the world?

That sounds like a great movie, but it is not the movie they will get if they watch this film. Instead they will get a comedy about sadness. Kind of a dark comedy, but they will not get the jokes. I loved this movie, and if that makes me weird, then so be it.

------------------------------------
Chester Kent: Why bother with shame at all is my philosophy.
==============================================

Filmed in the far Northern Canadian city of Winnipeg, one of the bleakest, coldest, cities in the entire world, it was filmed in black & white, and is kind of a parody of silent films, or at least the really early films, the talkies, that had just incorporated sound technology into the mix. The kind of film Lon Chaney made--especially the ones where he would play an armless beggar or some such, requiring him to contort himself into impossible postures. Isabella plays Lady Helen Port-Huntley, and though she is making a mint as the baroness of beer--especially since she is right over the border from the U.S. where Prohibition and The Great Depression are in order, she still has plenty to be sad about.

---------------------------
Lady Port-Huntley: If you are sad and like beer, I'm your lady.
==============================

She is missing both legs due to a freakish accident. Though Fyodor Kent (David Fox) is hopelessly smitten with her, she is carrying on a torrid affair with his son, Chester Kent (Mark McKinney). Chester is at the wheel, and so distracted by her carrying on he doesn't see his father trying to flag them down. Chester swerves, and then skids in the snow. The grotesque accident would really be tragic were it not so over the top that it seems like it is really just a big put on. You expect to see Ashton Kutcher emerge from behind a snowman to tell you that you've been punked. I started to warm up to this off beat comedy, and by the time they got to Fyodor's ""beer legs"" it had me.

There is a contest to find the saddest music in this film, and there is some very interesting music from all over the world. There is a quite sad arrangement of ""The Song is You,"" for cello, played by Chester's brother Roderick Kent, alias Gravillo the Great. ""The Song is You"" by Jerome Kern was a favorite of Frank Sinatra, and also musicians love it because the bridge, through a series of subterfuges manages to modulate a half step below the original key, and then when the main theme is reprised, it is like you are rising up, but you are really right back where you started. It is kind of an audio illusion, similar to the picture of the monks climbing the endless stairs at the top of the tower in that wood block print by M.C. Escher. But I digress.

The two brothers, Chester and Roderick Kent, are quite different. While Chester is a brash impresario who exemplifies the crass American approach to show biz, Roderick is an extremely sensitive soul. How sensitive is something I can't even begin to describe--you really have to see the film. The performances of Mark McKinney and Ross McMillan as Chester and Roderick, respectively, are really superb. They both hit the perfect tones--and though those tones are completely opposite, they somehow manage to magically harmonize. David Fox, as Fyodor, their father, is also worthy of mention. And don't let me forget Teddy (Darcy Fehr), Lady Helen Port-Huntley's ever accommodating manservant, or Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros), the oblivious object of Roderick's tortured desire.

Getting back to the contest, there is some great music, but it is all undercut by the competitive contest atmosphere. A loud and annoying buzzer goes off repeatedly whenever the judges start to get bored--which is often. Two announcers--Duncan Elksworth (Claude Dorge) and Mary (Talia Pura)--talk over the music, making inane comments, like sportscasters. It is really a great parody of the whole notion of American Idol style singing contests.

------------------
Mary: No one can beat the Siamese when it comes to dignity, cats, or twins.
====================================

So, I hope I have been ""helpful"" with this review, and though I really loved this film, it is not for everyone, and those Philistines who wouldn't appreciate this sort of billingsgate, and you know who you are--should avoid it like the plague.

2161865,5,B00062IXJW,"In classic Film Noir style, Guy Maddin directs The Saddest Music in the World, set in Winnipeg, Manitoba, (1933) during the depths of the Great Depression. Maddin, in collaboration with George Toles, sets the mood with an astute level of cinematography, employing old-fashioned iris lens techniques to create the antique, distressed look of a Golden-age movie-screen, using grainy blues and silvers to invoke moods of emotional intensity. He skillfully manipulates stark camera angles and chiaroscuro to accent light and shadowy effects, while highlighting exuberance and humor with unconventional music and dialogue.

Isabella Rossellini plays the role of the clever and tragic Lady Helen Port-Hunsley, a wealthy Canadian beer baroness who launches a world competition seeking the most melancholy music on the globe, as she endeavors to dramatically increase beer sales at the tail end of America's failed experiment of Prohibition. The purse is a huge twenty-five-thousand-dollar award that brings forth competitors from as far away as Scotland, Serbia and Siam. The main protagonist in the film emerges as the cynical Chester Kent (Mark McKinney), in contention with his brother, Roderick as Gavrillo the Great, and others in this great rivalry, where winners in each round slide into a giant vat of beer.

Twists and turns of emotion fill the plot, pulling you from humor to tragedy within a framework of grandeur and the absurd. As bygone secrets unravel, Fyodor, father of Chester and Roderick, attempts to exonerate his past guilt by fashioning glass legs filled with beer for Helen, his former lover, and the victim of an accidental amputation.

So, it is no surprise that his hundred minute long 2004 film The Saddest Music In The World is not good, not bad, simply weird. Visually, however, it's a truly brilliant work, with color freely mixing with black and white, on contrived sets that evoke German Expressionism from the 1920s, and with Vaseline smeared on the lenses to give it a softer look. It also has a grainier feel in some sections, and reputedly was shot on 8mm film, then blown up to make it even grainier looking, as if it was just uncovered from some old studio's vault. The only other recent film that I've seen that invokes such a different place, time, and worldview was Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow, which was also set in the 1930s. However, whereas that film was an homage to the classic serials and set in New York City, and global vista, and shot all on blue screen, this film is set in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in Canada, and the world comes to Winnipeg, which has been chosen by the London Times as the world capital of sorrow, four years running.
  Reputedly, the film is based upon a screenplay by the highly regarded novelist Kazuo Ishiguro (most famous for The Remains Of The Day) which Maddin and co-writer George Toles added their own idiosyncratic spin to. The plot is rather thin, and follows a legless and blondly bewigged beer baroness, Lady Port-Huntly (Isabella Rossellini), who decides to capitalize on the impending revocation of Prohibition in America top make a killing. She decides to hold a musical contest to determine the saddest music in the world, and offers a prize of $25,000.
  Overall, The Saddest Music In The World is one of those films that I am loath to comment too harshly on. This is because while it fails, overall, as a film, one cannot help but admire the daring and vision of a director like Maddin. After all, in this dumbed down cookie cutter world of film put forth by megabucks Hollywood schlockmeisters like Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, and George Lucas, Maddin can easily and rightly be seen as a hero to arthouse, indy film lovers.
  However, none of that concerns me as a critic. So, I have to say that, despite some razzle-dazzle, and the best of intentions, The Saddest Music In The World ultimately is not a good film. No, it's not a bad film, but one has to wonder what it might have been if the original Ishiguro screenplay had been more faithfully followed. Perhaps then it might have had some of the depth and real inquisitive power that great art has. As it is it is merely a curio. But, occasionally, them things can be damned flashy, can't they?",1221868800,,2664,4.586134453781512

2161868,5,B00062IXJW,"Love, death, beer, dismemberment, and really sad music.

""The Saddest Music"" in the world is perhaps Guy Maddin's most accessable movie to date, from a director known for strange, eerie pieces of work. But it's also a brilliantly surreal tragicomedy, with shimmers of German expressionism painted over a story about fumbling for artificial happiness, in the middle of all that sad music.

It's snow-smothered Winnipeg, in the Depression. Failing producer Chester (Mark McKinney) and his amnesiac girlfriend Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) into a bar, just as beer baroness Lady Helen Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) announces something on the radio: a musical contest for the saddest song in the world, with $25,000 as the prize. Hundreds of musicians arrive to compete, hoping to bag the prize (and get bathed in beer).

She is also an old flame of Chester's, who blames him and his alcoholic father for the loss of her legs -- a loss that his dad Fyodor (David Fox) is trying to remedy, by making her glass prosthetics. And his brother Roderick returns home, paralyzed by grief over his son's death and his wife leaving. But when he discovers his wife -- Narcissa -- is with his brother, he is determined to beat Chester. Who will create the saddest music in the world?

""The Saddest Music In the World"" is a really weird movie -- it's full of glass legs, hearts in jars, skating funerals, and an antlered seer who predicts doom for Chester. But the movie is really focused on just one thing: the false happiness that people seek from transient things -- money, prosthetics, booze -- and how these only lead to more heartbreak in the end.

Maddin has a pretty unique style -- neo-expressionist, like an old 1920s German silent film made in twenty-first century Canada. It's grainy and full of rapid cuts (dozens of musicians playing until they bloody their hands), shadows and stark white faces, even against the drifting snow. The only exception is the dream sequences, which are just as blurry but full of vibrant colour.

But he sprinkles it with darkly humorous moments -- Fyodor chugging beer from a glass leg -- and dialogue ranging from zany (""I'm not an American. I'm a nymphomaniac"") to weirdly poetic (""... to lay claim to the jewel-studded crown... of frozen tears""). And there are moments of sorrow too, such as Roderick playing his ultimate sad song, for a woman who is only starting to remember him.

McKinney is deliciously despicable as the amoral Chester, Medeiros is sweet as the wide-eyed nympho, and McMillan is heartbreaking as the mournful Roderick, who is haunted by the loss of his family. But Rossellini really rules the movie as the brilliantly cruel, powerful Lady Port-Huntley -- she rules every scene, even when she gets dumped into a bathtub.

""The Saddest Music in the World"" is a deliciously bizarre tragicomedy, filmed with Guy Maddin's neo-expressionist flair. Definitely a unique, delightfully dark movie.",1211328000,2,2942,4.977596741344196
2161869,5,B00062IXJW,"If Un Chien Andalou, The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari, The Blue Angel, Samuel Beckett's ""Film,"" Buster Keaton, German Expressionism, Tristan Tzara, Jean Cocteau, and LSD have any resonance for you - then you are ready to dive into a large, foamy vat of The Saddest Music In The World.  This exquisite film is certainly not for everyone, but its intended audience will love it.  I did.

Critics tend to be analytical people, and - like humorless individuals attempting to explain why a joke isn't funny - even the ones who praise this picture seem to be missing the point by a province or two.  In dreams all things are possible and the unreasonable is reasonable.  One does not dictate to a dream, one follows it in awe and rapture.  In dreams it is quite normal for a man to carry the heart of his dead son with him everywhere in a bottle.  In dreams, Marlene Dietrich-esque beauties hold court poised on glass legs filled with beer.

Certain performances deserve mention.  Rossellini, always good, is exceptionally good here.  Maria de Medeiros as Narcissa is quite unnerving, really powerful.  But the sleeper performance is by David Fox as Fyodor Kent, the demented cellist.  His character is from off the map, in all respects, and yet he has intense credibility throughout.

But.  The hero of The Saddest Music In The World in director Guy Maddin, not to mention the set designers, costume designers, prop men and women, and especially cinematographers around him.  This is a very funny, deeply absurd movie with layer upon layer of irony, silliness, homage, and self-referential humor.  But what it is most is a feast, even an orgy, for the eyes - no small trick given that it's in B&W except for a few brief moments when it slips, again, dream-like, into color.  Not a film to analyze, just surrender to it.  You never saw a ""battle of the bands"" quite like this.",1201392000,6,1865,4.703703703703703
2161870,3,B00062IXJW,"I recently saw this again on IFC, and I have to admit, I don't really like it as much as I thought I did.  Guy Maddin is a Canadian filmmaker who has one of the most unique visual styles today.  He shoots his films in a deliberate ""silent film"" style (with iris shot and hand tinted frames) which is fascinating to watch.  Unfortunately, his films (especially this one) are all style and very little substance.  For a bit, I watched some of this film with the sound off, and it was better that way.  Once you get past his very fascinating and at times overwhelming technique, there really isn't much there.  He seems to be mocking his characters and the smarmy dialogue and performances seem to confirm this.  The story here is quite unique (it's a contest to create the saddest music in the world).  To me, that story has endless possibilities.  Sadly, it feels like Maddin doesn't really have any feeling for the people of the depression.  It was not a particularly great time to be living in.  Maddin treats them kind of like a joke, which I don't agree with and it detracts from the initial storyline.

My favorite film of his is, surprisingly, his short film The Heart of the World (which is available on the Twilight of the Ice Nymphs/Archangel DVD), which is a wicked parody of Soviet silent films.  The story of that film is silly and shallow (boy meets girl kind of stuff), but the film is only 30 minutes long or so, so it works very well in that type of format.  Another great short film of Guy's is Sissy Boy Slap Party (included on this DVD as a bonus) which is hilarious and actually better than the feature.  I think Guy is talented and certainly unique.  His style seems more suited to short films than to feature length ones.

Personally, I believe people should see at least one of his films just to take in the look of them.  He's not a horrible filmmaker, just too flashy for me.",1195862400,,1899,4.423631123919308
2161871,1,B00062IXJW,"This movie does not use surrealism.  There is no contradictions of time and location. There is no acting out of dreams.  It only feels surreal.  This movie is Satanic, not surreal.  It feels surreal because of some stylistic decisions the director made, but primarily because of the contradictory and opposite emotions associated with all of the suffering and torment that the characters experience.  When tragedy strikes instead of sadness, regret and compassion, there is laughter, glee and revelry.  This movie is philosophically Satanic.  It embraces the torment of others: when the fires are burning up everything and everyone runs for their lives in horror, the star is rejoicing and explicitly professing his extreme happiness and just soaking it all in. There is even a cameo of Lucifer laughing at it all.  It embraces suicide.  It laughs at the pain of others. Betrayal is not denigrated.  Promises mean nothing. This is not a ""dark comedy""; it is just plain dark and twisted. Wash up after watching this sick thing.",1193702400,3,1026,5.053571428571429
2161902,5,B00062IXJW,"This may, quite frankly, be the strangest movie in the world but it works so well in all its utter weirdness that I have to rave this film to its very core.  Coming across as an old silent film, choppy and filmed in black and white, `The Saddest Music in the World' is one of the most artistic and genius films I've seen in quite a long time.  I am new to the world of Guy Madden so maybe this style isn't new to any long standing fan but I for one had no idea what to expect when I sat down to witness this creative masterpiece, but I will admit that at the first glimpse of the grainy footage I was instantaneously absorbed in the film.

The film has a very interesting plot, absurd as many have noted, but interesting none-the-less.  Taking place in the midst of the Great Depression in the city of Winnipeg `The Saddest Music in the World' covers a competition held by an amputee beer baroness to find just that, the saddest music in the world.  She encourages the countries of the world to compete in their sorrow to ultimately win a cash prize of $25,000.  This peeks the curiosity of many but most notably a father and his two sons who have a special connection to the baroness Lady Helen Port-Huntley.  First is Chester Kent, a man who had at one time been involved with Lady Helen while his father Fyodor loved her.  The clash between father and son over this woman is what ultimately cost her both of her legs.  Chester has since moved on but Fyodor continues to harbor love and devotion for Lady Helen.  Next comes Chester's brother Roderick who loathes his brother for various reasons but is suffering from the loss of his son and the disappearance of his wife on top of family resentment.  Father and two sons enter the contest on apposing sides.

The underlying implications of `The Saddest Music in the World' are deep, much deeper than one may expect upon initial reaction to the brand of satire presented.  The main character of Chester Kent is incapable of sadness.  He is the happiest man alive so-to-speak and this becomes a central idea or issue raised throughout the film.  His lack of emotional feeling allows him to destroy his relationships because he cannot feel the pain of rejection of circumstance.  He has no reservations of hesitations about sleeping with the woman his father loves, nor does he care when it becomes known to him that the strange woman he is now involved with just may be his brothers long lost wife.  In the opening scenes Chester is speaking with a fortune teller who informs him of his fate based on his inability to feel sadness.  This theory is one that we do well to contemplate.

Sadness is an attribute that makes us human, it makes us individuals and shapes our values and morals and ultimately the person we will become.  When ironing out the differences between those who love more and those who love less it's usually determined by their ability to feel the pain of the unloving.  If someone has grown callus to feeling in that they cannot feel the emotional pain of loss then they are less likely to extend love and consideration but the individual who fears the loss of fellow feeling is more likely to extend kindness and sincere hospitality to others in their lives.

The film also exposes the common trait of forced sadness and in contrast the rare expressions of genuine or authentic grief or despair.  All too often sadness is dramatized in order to receive sympathy from others but real sadness is a rare attribute we all do well to attain and cultivate.

On the outset `The Saddest Music in the World' may not appear to be that deep of a `message' film but when one digs a little deeper they can see its purpose.

The acting is phenomenal here.  The hysterics and over the top theatrical expressions help capture the era Guy Madden sought after and helps establish an artistic mood and setting for the picture.  Mark McKinney is exceptionally good here, hamming it up for the camera while still maintaining the earnestness his character requires.  Isabella Rossellini though is the star here.  Her portrayal of Lady Helen Port-Huntley is effortless and downright brilliant.  David Fox is wonderful as Fyodor and Ross McMillan captures the pain and devastation of Roderick's character masterfully.  Maria de Medeiros is stunning as Narcissa the strange young girl who may or may not be Roderick's bride.

In the end this bizarre film is a genuine masterpiece if I ever saw one and is worth its weight.  I highly recommend this film, but I warn you to watch this with an open mind for this is not your typical entertainment.  This is deep and meaningful, but its importance is glossed over with outrageous theatrics so one must be willing to examine each and every frame to find its inner beauty.",1193702400,2,4763,4.604265402843602

The film takes place in Winnipeg, Canada, ""The world capital of sorrow"" in 1933 during the Great Depression. A legless beer baroness, Lady Port-Huntly (Isabella Rossellini in a blond wig) organizes a contest to find the saddest music in the world. Musicians from around the globe arrive to Winnipeg to try and win a $25,000 prize. Among them is Chester (Mark McKinney), her old boyfriend who arrived with his lover, Bosnian singer Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros of ""Pulp Fiction""), the amnesiac nymphomaniac who listens the advice of a telepathic tapeworm in her bowels. Chester's brother Roderick (Ross McMillan) is the contestant from Serbia performing by the name Gavrilla the Great, hiding his face under the big veil and looking like Salvador Dali in his craziest. He is overwhelmed by the death of his young son and looks for his long lost wife, who happened to be Narcissa who had lost her memory and does remember neither him nor their little boy. Chester's and Roderick's father Fyodor (David Fox) enters for Canada. He's got his own sad story. One night while drunk, he caused a car crash and attempted to save his lover by amputating her crushed leg -- but, being drunk cut off the wrong leg. The lover was Lady Port-Huntly who at the time of the crash was cheating on Fyodor with Chester in the car. Is it crazy enough? Wait until you see it. Visually, the film is nothing I've seen before but I understand that Maddin's fans will recognize his very distinguished style - the film shot in black and white, and edited in such a way as to recall the old pictures from the 1930s. There are a couple of color scenes, and those moments stand alone. One of the most striking color images is Isabella Rossellini standing on glass legs filled with beer from her breweries. If for nothing else, the film should be seen for this jaw - dropping moment.

It is certainly not for everyone but I am glad I saw it. How could I not like this dialog?

2161911,5,B00062IXJW,"Just about any of Guy Maddin's films would have made interesting additions to the midnight movie circuit, but perhaps his most accessible feature to date, THE SADDEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD, is the one most likely to sell a few soundtrack albums as well.

  Tongue-in-cheek social satire and musical melodrama merge in this expressionistic film that combines a loving homage to the early days of cinema with the sheer strangeness of life. The biting cold of winter and the circumstances of the Great Depression have turned 1933 Winnipeg into the saddest place on earth. As a marketing ploy, leg-less beer Baroness, Lady Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) stages an international competition to find the saddest music in the world. With $25,000 going to the winner, oddball musicians and two-bit schemers pour into the Canadian town from all over the world. Among them is smarmy, down-on-his-luck Broadway impresario Chester Kent (Mark McKinney), returning home with his amnesiac girlfriend Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros). As the contest progresses, Chester finds himself competing against his estranged brother while also re-igniting a past love-triangle involving himself, the Baroness, and his own alcoholic, ex-surgeon father. Complicating matters further are the secret identity of Narcissa, and the elder Kent's gift to the Baroness--a pair of beer filled, glass, prosthetic legs. Spectacular musical numbers alone can't save the sad characters from fate, and ultimately tragedy strikes as the last note is sounded.

  Maddin's signature archaic visual look, his unique sense of humor, and his subplots-and-triangles driven storytelling are all displayed here in abundance.  Rather than spotlighting a single romantic triangle, a pair of interlocked trios buttresses this momentous melodrama.  Played with wondrous flair, Chester revels in the fact that he's stolen the hearts from his emasculated father and brother former lovers.  Playing with some of his favorite themes (rival brothers, amnesia, a missing parent) and embracing the trappings of the musical, Maddin has succeeded in creating an accessible, artful, and ambitious film.",1149120000,6,2136,5.608695652173913

Mark McKinney hams it up as Chester Kent, Helen's former lover who took her heart...and legs.

2161945,5,B00062IXJW,"Guy Maddin's stylized film, ""The Saddest Music in the World,"" has been mislabeled as ""Surrealist;""  it is not.  The visual display of the settings, along with the stylized costumes fall clearly into the stage and film genre called ""expressionistic-contructivistic,"" a creature of design from the 1920s silent film studios, primarily, of the UFA films complex near Berlin, and the mechanistic stage-designs of the early Soviets, under the watchful eye of the Kommisar of Education (Culture), Lunacharski.

  The formal or sociological element of such ""expressionism"" remains with the placement of man-the-victim, into a hostile world environment, in which the atmostphere, itself, is mephitic, and hopeless.  Man struggles against a ""system,"" as the playwright, August Strindberg, wrote his ""The Dream Play,"" which is ever forlorn to him; he is adrift, as it were, in a sea of ethical indifference.

  Now, the people of such an expressionistic film are always flawed in both their character and background development.  They share the burden of a shameful ""historicity"" of their past as the Phenomenologists would say; while, at the same time the characters bravely struggle against 1.) the environment, 2.) their antagonists, and 3.) themselves, in good ""existentialist"" fashion.

  Whether the characters of ""Saddest Music"" can be justly punished, reprieved, or liberated from their past transgressions and omissions, remains the film's thesis. Their confrontations and recollection-of-past-confrontations comprise the film's major point in the drama.

  One other observation should be made about Maddin's work which has been somewhat overlooked. His aesthetic dwells with both  the ""exotic"" and ""grosteque"" in life, a distinct and popular, 19th-century pictoral genre.  Federico Fellini also used grostesquerie to great effect in expresssing his photographic selectivity.  All in all, the characters of ""Saddest Music"" lead lives of desperation, and certainly not ""quite desperation"" at that.

  There is little empathy or identification associated with the charcters in Maddin's film, leading to one's more passive (or as Berthold Brecht would say, ""objective"") observance of it, as, say,  one might watch performers in a circus, or, following Brecht's postulation a bit further, one  experiences what he called ""epic drama"" as distinct from empathic,""engaged,"" or subjective drama.  With the latter a person must resort psychologically to S.T. Coleridge's ""willful suspension of disbelief,"" in order to engage in the drama.  Maddin's film does not require any such submersion, but rather exhibits itself as a ""presentation"" of bizarre events, matrixed by the remoteness of place and time, rather than exposed as  a ""representation"" of meaningful events as displayed in a conventional, narrative drama.  No, as another Canadian once remarked, the medium is the message in ""Saddest Music,"" and what a medium-message it is!

  As such, ""Saddest Music"" is a film-maker's film, a superb example of what a group of talented, educated film-technicians can do with visual material and, of course,  three-million dollars. ""Saddest Music"" is a ""Sundance Film,"" _ne plus ultra_. All readers who enjoyed the silent films of the early German/Russian period in the 1920s should enjoy this work very much.  ""The Saddest Music in the World"" is the best film I've seen at a Sundance Film Festival in many-a-year.",1112140800,7,3401,5.567251461988304

I can see the appeal of this type of movie, it's just not my style. The musical interludes were the best part & weren't particularly sad. The acting was wooden & stiff & maybe that's the point I missed. A movie doesn't have to be good to be a cult classic & that's where I see this movie heading.

2161959,5,B00062IXJW,"Art is a subjective experience with no necessarily functional purpose, but with the intent to create a unique happening as time and place are relative to the creator's approach to the moment of conceptualization of an impression.  The impression art has on it's audience is relative to the audience's acquired values, morals, and beliefs, which are based on life long experiences.  The obtained knowledge will help skew the audience's appreciation of the art in the direction of like or dislike.  This means that the appreciation of the art is completely in the hands of the spectator as knowledge and wisdom function as a guide.  One of these art forms is music as it produces a subjective happening as the listener makes their own judgment based on their past experiences and values, which makes it desirable or not.

In the Saddest Music of the World Lady Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) arranges a musical competition, in Winnipeg, Canada, at peak of the Great Depression.  The Great Depression, a time when people suffered from starvation, poverty, and homelessness in great numbers throughout many parts of the world, has a special spot in American history.  This was a time when United States enforced the law of prohibition, yet alcohol was still easily accessible in illegal clubs and bars where people could drown their sorrows.  Misery was plentiful and an income was hard to come by, which made the $25,000 winning reward in the music competition extremely attractive as many had plenty of misery to share.  However, the music competition was a front for corporate greed as the winning music was intended to help increase the revenues for alcohol sales, as prohibition was nearing its end.

The story opens with Chester Kent's (Mark McKinney) visit to a blind seer in Winnipeg where he is told to look into his own lost soul and listen to seer's warning.  Chester does not take the warning seriously.  Instead Chester takes the opportunity to have a sexual encounters with his nymphomaniac mistress and traveling companion Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) while insulting the seer at the end.  This moment sets up Chester's character, which seems to be driven by an enterprising greed and cruelty towards those in his path, while missing the important aspects of life.  Chester also has certain levels of talent to create music, but he does not possess the ability to feel the musical experience as he seems to lack the wisdom.

After the brief introduction of Chester the audience is to follow him on his reunion with his former lover and brewery owner Lady Port-Huntley, his father, Fyodor (David Fox), and his long lost Serbian brother, Roderick (Ross McMillan).  Chester's reunion brings several flashbacks to the audience where the viewer can witness the tragedy behind the family whose pain is about to be exploited on the stage as they all compete for the $25,000.  These flashbacks show how Lady Port-Huntley lost her legs by the alcoholic hands of Fyodor and how Roderick lost his son followed by his wife leaving him.  When these people meet again it tears up old scars that never seemed to have healed, which causes further anguish among those involved.

The competition becomes a farce where the true beauty of the musical art is exploited and measured by how much beer the audience gulps down during the competition.  In addition, Lady Port-Huntley is the lone judge of the competition, as her choice of a winner is ultimately affected by her past experiences with the competing persons.  This means that the competition turns out to be a subjective experience, but not subjective in regards to the music.  Chester who knows Lady Port-Huntley pushes the right buttons in order to achieve the goal to win the $25,000.  This means that Chester also buys the competition as he cannot generate something completely unique, and he turns the music into a decadent show of visual and auditory experiences, which means that he does not rely on the music.

Each musical performance is represented by countries such as Siam, Serbia, and the United States whereas Chester represents the United States, his father Canada, and his brother Serbia.  The national division serves as an analogy to the dysfunction in the family.  It also provides some insights to why the family members lack appropriate communication skills, or empathy to hear the pain of others as their pain seems to be overwhelming to themselves.  This notion is supported by flashbacks and heavy symbolism such as Roderick carrying his child's heart in a glass jar that is submerged in his tears.

The director, Guy Maddin, produces a genuinely surreal cinematic event that will bring the audience a nostalgic visual experience through the throwback cinematography.  The throwback cinematography reminds the viewer of films made during the silent era, and the time when the story supposedly takes place, 1933.  The camera has a clear focus in the center of the image while the surrounding area closer to the edge of the frame becomes more dissolved into fussiness.  The film is mostly shot in black and white, but it does have moments of color that enhance the emotional experience.  Using this technique adds to the visual experience in a way that makes it feel as if it was the 1930s.

The Saddest Music in the World is in the hands of the beholder, and to truly become engrossed by the story it helps to have a good understanding of the art form film.  This is because the film utilizes a unique style that brings bizarre comedy and tragedy mixed into one while the script and cast guide the audience into a bleak dream where Maddin conceptualizes his vision of a personal impression.  In the end, the impression is left for the audience to ponder as Maddin leaves the viewers a heap of notions and perspectives on what has taken place during the film.",1107043200,25,5834,4.930470347648262
2161960,3,B00062IXJW,"The premise: would-be minstrels gather in Winnipeg in 1933 for the ""Port Huntley Lager Saddest Music in the World"" contest, intended to bring levity to the ""saddest city in the world"" at the height of the great depression, and sell a few beers along the way. I think the braintrust behind this film had a few too many Port Huntley lagers when they were coming up with this one. A bizarre movie with a generally incomprehensible plot, made interesting by the 1930s era stylings of the visuals - part silent flic, part surrealism, part Movietone News reel. Goofy, entertaining performances abound, particularly by Rosselini as the legless beer magnate.

2161961,2,B00062IXJW,"I ""get"" Guy Maddin. I thought ""Careful"" was very clever and entertaining and ""Twilight Of The Ice Nymphs"" certainly worth a peek on a rainy day. But I refuse to wet myself over Emperor Maddin's newest clothes merely because it's simply ""different"". It IS possible to be ""different"" and still be ENTERTAINING at the same time, and I think Maddin has now officially worn out his welcome with the let's-smear-vaseline-on-the-lens-and-use-super-8-cameras-and-Expressionist-set-design-and-make-this-look-like-a-lost-silent-film-from-the-1920's trick with the release of ""Saddest Music In The World"". The idea of an international musical olympics, where countries compete to compose the Saddest Music In The World is quite brilliant and a great comic set-up (wouldn't the Swedes be shoo-ins?), and would have made a perfect SHORT film subject. After about 30 minutes, Maddin runs out of ideas and then literally precedes to wear the viewer down through sheer repetition of images and set-pieces. Isabella Rosselini is quite watchable, as always (even rolling around on a cart as a double-amputee) but she alone does not have the power to carry this film. Worth a look if you crave the offbeat, but ultimately just chalk this one up as an interesting failure from a genuinely talented director.",1103587200,5,1287,5.538071065989848
2161962,3,B00062IXJW,"If you know that Isabella Rossellini is married to David Lynch, you will have no problem understanding why she chose to star in this film.  Director Guy Maddin tells a bizarre story, filmed through a snowy, distorted lens in black and white, making for a truly surreal vision.  The story itself is simply about a Baroness in Canada who recrutes musicians from around the world to promote the worlds ""saddest"" music for a large sum of money.  However, instead of gut wrenching sorrowful music, the audience is treated to a unique collage of `cold' characters seeming to come from the 19th century.  The cinematography is fantastic, but the characters don't bring much life to the story.  They are all stilted, bland inventions plucked straight from a silent film.  At best the film is a study in film cinematography and style.  There is love, tragedy and all the elements of true cinema, but it never fully evolves.  However, the film is an advanced version of what David Lynch might have done if he chose this story, time and place.  This film is for the real film buff who will not be disappointed.

The extra featurettes are truly amazing and spark enough interest in what a filmmaker will do to make his dream come true.",1103155200,26,1223,4.699530516431925

I have been watching films for over 45 years and never have  seen such a hilarious tongue-in-cheek presentation of a film about sadness.  Three of the five most important characters are wallowing in their own self-pity to such extremes I couldn't believe it or stop laughing.  German expressionism copycat...whatever dude...get over yourselves.  It's set in the depression and it's about sadness.  Where would you rather have it based?  In Hawaii?  The low budget sets were beliveable and the over the top acting was right in tune with the theme.  I can't wait to see his earlier pics.",1102377600,12,911,4.762820512820513
2161964,3,B00062IXJW,"These sort of hyper-visual, experimental movies need to be made now and then to show what filmmaking and imagination can achieve in the arts. Of course, a movie like this relies more on visuals and technique than story - though that's not to say there isn't a story here. It's just not the most compelling story. The movie itself could easily have been condensed into something like 45 minutes, maybe even 30, and you'd still walk away with the point they were trying to make. Making it as long as a feature film gives it more ""legitimacy,"" I suppose, so it won't be tucked away in some IFC ""short collection."" But as well conceived as it is, with superb 20's/30's atmosphere (grainy, black and white, glowing, surreal-faux sets), you simply sit back and feel bored a lot of the time because of the slowness of the story. Visuals can only carry a film so far. Genius filmmaking? Well, that'd debatable. But it's refreshing, and I think essential, that experimental movies like this be made. If the actual story and the characters had been more compelling, I think this would be a ""must buy"" and one you'd want to see quite a few times. I've watched it once, I'm glad I did, but I doubt I'll ever see it again. Not bad, not great - as a movie. But great eye candy!",1101254400,4,1263,4.471861471861472

Although I was engaged enough to sit through the whole film, immediately afterwards (and for large chunks of the viewing itself) I felt that I wasted my time watching it.  It's painfully derivative of David Lynch's work (which I've never been overly fond of...) along with the same sort of kinetic, surrealistic visual absurdism as movies like ""City Of Lost Children"" and ""Amelie.""  This is a well-crafted film, in terms of its look, the editing, and the elaborate cinematographic trickery, but the easy irony and lack of true emotional substance ultimately makes it an artsy cinematic puff piece.",1101168000,5,875,5.235714285714286
