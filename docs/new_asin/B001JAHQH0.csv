3653166,5,B001JAHQH0,I am so tired of flipping channels and turning the TV off. When will the remaining seasons from this terrific show FINALLY be released?!?,1349136000,4,137,4.75
3653167,5,B001JAHQH0,Please release all the season. The last few seasons were better than the first- people will buy it if its available.,1335398400,3,116,4.571428571428571
3653168,5,B001JAHQH0,"Pity poor 20th Century Fox-every time they are questioned as to why they don't release certain back catalogue tv titles on dvd they always respond with 'not marketable enough to warrant distribution' or some similar response. After releasing the 1st season of The Mary Tyler Moore show, it took them around 3 or 4 years before they finally relented and started releasing additional seasons. Well, hopefully Shout Factory, who licensed the rights to another Fox series, Rhoda, will rescue the classic tv show Hill St. Blues from oblivion so that we fervent fans can finally own and enjoy one of the 5 greatest tv crime dramas ever created. If not Shout Factory, then maybe VEI, who has truly done a fantastic job of releasing every season of the very entertaining series McMillan & Wife. Either way, Hill St. Blues is way too great a series to be allowed to become a distant memory!!!",1333152000,12,883,4.777777777777778
3653169,5,B001JAHQH0,Hill Street Blues is entertaining TV from the 80's. It would be great if viewers could purchase the entire set. Does anybody know if/when they will be available?,1288310400,4,161,4.785714285714286

3653171,1,B001JAHQH0,"I agree complety with ""Gordy D"". This tv series was amazing. The producers have to release togheter all the seassons.

3653265,5,B001JAHQH0,"Thank you so much for releasing the seasons individually.  I know that there is a complete boxed set, but some people can't afford to get it all at once and need the individual sets to enjoy.  It's been a long time, but this is a classic show that keeps you on the edge of your seat each week.  Some of the finest acting that still holds up today!  I can't wait to hear those immortal words again, ""Let's be careful out there.""",1424044800,,427,4.170731707317073
3653266,5,B001JAHQH0,"Season 4. Most television programs peak with their third season and begin their slow but inevitable decline with Season 4. Not so with HSB. The acting remained first rate (I'd like to highlight the underappreciated Jon Cypher, who really stands out as oily Chief Daniels, and James B Sikking's Howard Hunter along with Barbara Bosson's Fay Furillo one note characters grow into three dimensional characters this season). And the writing remained top notch for the first three quarters of the season (very strong storylines dealing with corruption, an election that turns the Hill upside down and shocking deaths. Dated technology aside, the show remains  powerful now as it did way back in the day.

Spoilers Begin:
I nicknamed  Season Four ""The Season of Death"" the season marked the final appearances of many recurring characters, most notably the beloved Sgt Phil Esterhaus (with the untimely passing of actor Michael Conrad), his passing left a void that was never satisfactorily filled; Belker's repeating nemesis pickpocket has a memorable sendoff; Hector Ruiz, a troubled teen from the very first episode bites it, as does a potential romantic partner for Bobby Hill. But none of these deaths are for shock value and have repercussions effecting the major characters.
Spoiler End.

Season Four is HSB's last hurrah. The series would continue on for three more seasons, but it surrenders to the soap opera elements that the writers balanced so well in seasons past, and for me, the show falls off the rails with season 5. Having said all this, if you haven't experienced the series as a whole, I would urge you to continue on. But this is where I disembark on my journey. It was great while it lasted, and I feel richer for the experience, but I want to remember the show while it was at it's best. Thanks for the great ride ladies and gents in blue. As always, be careful out there.",1418601600,6,1889,4.8753894080996885
3653267,5,B001JAHQH0,This indeed is one of the best police dramas ever to be aired.  It is insanity for the entire series not to be released immediately.,1376870400,,132,4.28
3653268,5,B001JAHQH0,"This TV drama was innovative.  It had a very successful run as part of NBC's Thursday night lineup that included The Cosby Show, Family Ties, Cheers, and Night Court.  It influenced similar shows which came later such as ER and NYPD Blues.  It was popular and it was of high quality.

  So why, when we have so many inferior shows making their way to home DVD is this show ignored?",1368748800,2,381,4.371428571428571

8312262,5,B001JAHQH0,We continue to watch the Hill Street Blues series and revisit old friends from the Hill.  The picture quality if great.  It's amazing that the problems that the police experienced in the 80's continue today.,1505088000,,207,4.885714285714286

8312264,5,B001JAHQH0,This is an old series but well worth watching - very fun police procedural,1496966400,,74,4.357142857142857
8312265,3,B001JAHQH0,"If you get to the end of season 3, you're pretty much seen most of what this series presents that you'll want to see.  Season 4 presents a few changes: the replacement of Esterhaus with a new Sergeant, and a few personnel shuttles to try to spiff up dying screenwriting.  The ascension of Dennis Franz into a role suggesting his future success occurs. But after season 4, the series dies slowly of 1,000 razor blades cuts do a lack of imaginative screenwriting. For season 7, the show just stops.  There is no ending, no farewall segment.  It just stops.",1493856000,,554,4.565656565656566
8312266,5,B001JAHQH0,"HILL STREET BLUES Season 4 continues its run as great television.  This is the season Sgt. (the poet) Esterhaus dies in the sack (Michael Conrad died in Nov. 22, 1983...) with Mrs Gardener (Barbara Babcock).  His final role call as ""read"" by Capt Furillo (Daniel J Travanti) is a touching tribute to the man (and actor).
Henry Goldblume (Joe Spano) does 'role call' briefly until Lucy Bates (Betty Thomas) is promoted to Sergeant ahead of slightly jealous Coffey (Ed Marinaro).
There is the eventual cop killer in Season 4.  All are on edge, for sure.
Furillo is considering ""drink"" (it's been 7 years...) as job and relationship with Davenport (Veronica Hamel) begin to weigh on him.
This is top-notch still, even if the Precinct windows must have been shot-out and/or shattered in general at least 6 times by Season 4!  A little silly for sure especially when ex-Mrs. Furillo karate chops ""a creep"" through one of the windows for comic relief.  Hunter (James B Sikking), impressed, then asks-out Mrs Furillo to the opera.  Oh well.  Show, overall, still great.
P.S. By my count at least 2 people have fallen through Hill Street Precinct ceiling, too.  Yes, it is a zoo around there, but,
again, HILL STREET BLUES SEASON 4 still rates plenty of quality.
5 stars.",1489708800,2,1263,4.814814814814815
8312267,4,B001JAHQH0,"There was a spot on disk 5 that would freeze up the entire system on all 3 DVD players I have.  The set was replaced 2 days after notification.

This is an awesome series that I stumbled upon on HULU.  After watching seasons 1 thru 3 (all available) I came here to buy the remaining 4. Love this series and holds up even today though there are a few noticeable things I needed to explain to my granddaughter, like corded dial phones and all the big boats that they were driving around in.  It held her interest at 11 as well.

This was the first hour long crime drama and led the way for shows like Law and Order franchise and NYPD Blue.  I love the way the main characters of the show grow in their characters as the show progresses.  I still remember back in the day waiting to see Joyce Davenport and Frank Furillo wrestling around and teasing and laughing with one another at the end of most episodes.  I wish todays shows were based on a similar formula so they appear more realistic and based on real people with real thoughts, faults and emotions.

Even Franks ex wife is a stand up character who, though somewhat annoying in the first season or so becomes a part of the show that is loved and appreciated on her own merits.  All the characters are shown with flaws as people are and the flaws are the same as what we deal with even today.

Great show, great story, plots and characters.  Steven Bochco's finest work!",1489449600,,1424,4.332075471698113
