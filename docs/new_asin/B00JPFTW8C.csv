8652781,5,B00JPFTW8C,"Just in time for the release of The Rocks version of Hercules on July 25th, The History Channel and Lionsgate have teamed up to offer three of THCs shows that explore the man, the myth, and the legend.  The result is an excellent compilation of history and mythology that entertains as well as informs.

This DVD contains three History Channel shows:  Hercules: Power of the Gods, Clash of the Gods: Hercules, and In Search of History: The Greek Gods.  Each one has its merits, and each takes a unique look into the mystery behind the myth.

Hercules: Power of the Gods looks a bit dated (Im not sure when it was made), however it contains a plethora of information, including the stories and evidence that has been found about Hercules up to a point.  I say this because the next segment contains newer archaeological finds that shine even more light on who he was.  But regardless, the information presented here is fascinating.

Clash of the Gods: Hercules tells more about the truth behind the myth.  In 2004, in the Greek town of Thebes, the remains of an alter were found at an excavation site; surrounding the alter were many artifacts that told the story of the actual man Hercules is based upon.  This find is the most revealing in decades of research, as it finally illuminates the darkened figure that has long been regarded as nothing but a myth.

In Search of History: The Greek Gods gives insight on the gods themselves and how Hercules plays into the Greek pantheon.

I highly recommend HERCULES: HERO, GOD, WARRIOR.  It is an excellent DVD for anyone looking to gain more knowledge on this Superman of history, however parents might want to preview it before letting children watch it.  Many of the paintings and sculptures depict nude men and women, therefore it might not be family-friendly for some.",1405296000,2,1818,4.73015873015873
