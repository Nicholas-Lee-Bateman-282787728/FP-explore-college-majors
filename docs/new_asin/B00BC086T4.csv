8565615,5,B00BC086T4,"This is a fascinating journey through the exhibits and archives of the famous Mtter Museum in Philadelphia. The film is like entering into the text of the famous Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, but as poetry. It is not a film for the squeamish, as images of deformity and antique medical instruments must indeed resonate in the darker human recesses. Nevertheless I found this film moving, certainly not a mere field trip.

By the way you can find this DVD through the museum itself. If you have been following the films of the Brothers Quay then you will certainly add this to your collection.",1381708800,5,601,4.778846153846154
