8491871,3,B0063AB3GG,"The heroine is one of my favorite Chinese actresses who did a beautiful job in the movie Chungking Express. In this movie she is not up to par to that performance. This is not her fault, the script is cheesy, a transplant of Hollywood film making into Chinese culture. It's just plain doesn't work. Certainly not one of my favorite movies, and I can't recommend it!",1410566400,,365,4.545454545454546
