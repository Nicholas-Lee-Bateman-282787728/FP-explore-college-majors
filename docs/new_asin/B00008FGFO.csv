7982408,4,B00008FGFO,"If you're in the market for some early video of Eric Clapton, you've come to one of the few retail spots available.  While some film exists of Clapton with the Yardbirds, Cream, and cameo, back-up roles in 'The Last Waltz' and 'The Concert For Bangladesh', you're going to be hard pressed to find Eric performing anything close to a complete set of his early work.  Unfortunately, this video is not available on DVD (as of May 18, 2005), and arguably does not catch Clapton in the prime of his career, which occured in the early 1970's, touring as 'Derek and the Dominos'.  The set offered here does feature one-half of that band however, with Carl Radle on bass, and a scintillating version of one of their standards, 'Tell the Truth'.  That in itself is reason enough to hunt down a copy of this rare production.

'Live On the Whistle Test' captures Clapton and his band on their 1977 tour in support of his 1976 release 'No Reason To Cry' at the BBC Television Theatre.  No surprise then that three tracks from that disc are offered, the opener 'Hello Old Friend' and second track, 'Sign Language', along with the blues-rock number 'Double Trouble'.  Also no surprise is the inclusion of an eight and one-half minute version of Clapton's sole number one hit, 'I Shot the Sheriff' from 1974's '461 Ocean Boulevard'.  Much of the band accompanying Clapton on his 1977 tour, including singer Marcy Levy, drummer Jamie Oldaker, and second lead guitarist George Terry, appeared on that disc.  Two selections are drawn from Clapton's 1975 live disc 'E.C. Was Here', 'Further On Up the Road', and backup singer Yvonne Elliman's beautiful acoustic rendition of Blind Faith's 'Can't Find My Way Home'.  Other tracks include the slow-tempo blues number 'Alberta Alberta' (a John Lomax tune first performed by Clapton on this tour), 'Tell the Truth' from the epic 'Layla' disc, Bob Dylan's 'Knocking On Heaven's Door' (first covered by Clapton in June of 1975, and available on the 'Crossroads' anthology), and an eight minute performance of Cream's classic 'Badge' as the closer.

Eric's band has special meaning to myself, since two of the members, Detroit born and bred singer Marcy Levy, and drummer Jamie Oldaker both contributed to my favorite Bob Seger disc, 'Back In '72'.  Oldaker also toured with Seger on his notable 1977 tour as a member of the Silver Bullet Band.  Also featured are Dick Sims on the Hammond B3 organ, George Terry (who wrote 'Mainline Florida' for the '461...' disc) offering lead guitar on the first two tracks here while Clapton strums out the rhythm on an acoustic guitar, Sergio Pastora on a variety of percussion instruments, Yvonne Elliman on background vocals, and of course Carl Radle, who passed away in 1980, on bass.

The ten tracks chosen for this sixty minute set offer a good deal of diversity.  While 'Hello Old Friend' and 'Sign Language' offer agreeable pop, and 'Alberta Alberta' a shot of the blues, Clapton finally straps on the powered sound for 'Tell the Truth', and delivers a bit more up-tempo rendition than is found on the live 'In Concert' discs from 1970.  After Elliman's 'Can't Find My Way Home', Eric cranks up the blues again with 'Double Trouble'.  The reggae sound of Bob Marley's 'I Shot the Sheriff' is followed by an inspired 'Knockin On Heaven's Door'.  'Further On Up the Road' and especially 'Badge' rock the rafters in the finale.

There is no question that this rare performance would rate five stars if the recording quality was improved.  The video is sharp, but very few shots of Sims, Radle, and Oldaker are offered.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is less than desirable.  You'll definately be cranking up the volume, especially when the softer fare, such as 'Alberta Alberta' and 'Can't Find My Way Home' are queued up.  I believe you'll also notice that the recording fidelity lacks range, and is often unable to deliver some of the more subtle instruments such as Elliman's tambourine.  Despite the limitations, the rarity of this recording makes it an essential component of any Clapton fan's collection.",1116374400,,4079,4.895348837209302
7982409,5,B00008FGFO,"This is Classic Clapton from 1977. I take this as a rare performance and refreshing ,as I saw the show of him in Seattle in the same year.

The band is great and performs tight, with well done tunes and great vocals. ""Hello Old Friend -1st song"" was a top 40 hit and is performed nicely. This is just classic Clapton !

Don't miss it.",1094515200,,334,4.123076923076923
