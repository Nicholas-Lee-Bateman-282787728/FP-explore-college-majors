I had seen this film twice in film festivals.
It was very difficult to find.
The movie examines the difference in the ways men and women behave. I thought it was hilarious and felt it should have received wider distribution.
The price was reasonabe and delivered extremely promptly.",1359244800,2,299,4.882352941176471
