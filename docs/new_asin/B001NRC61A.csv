8327794,1,B001NRC61A,Absolutely the worst Amazon purchase I have ever made.  Amateurish grainy images repeated ad nauseum boring muzak no commentary.  Save your money,1266451200,2,145,5.545454545454546
8327795,5,B001NRC61A,"This is a beautifully shot and edited documentary of QE2's last year along with her two younger sisters giving her a royal sendoff.  There are some stunning shots of her crossing the North Atlantic at full speed (taken from the QM2 sailing in tandem).  Some shots are especially poignant when you know that this was her last time after a 40-year career which spanned more than a generation.
This is a must for anyone who has or has ever wanted to sail on a true ocean liner.",1234137600,2,474,4.436781609195402
8327796,5,B001NRC61A,"I was there for several of these events.  The 3 Queens meeting under cover of darkness in the morning of the 13th, the evening of the 13th when they majestically sailed out of NYC, when the Elizabeth and the Mary left together from New York one last time in October.  This dvd brought back all the memories and emotions that I will always treasure.

Mr. Marshall's love for the ships is evident and has such a way with words and pictures that he inspires the viewer, even if he or she has never sailed on a Cunarder, to be just as excited at the events that were part of Elizabeth's last year and how they were shared with her sisters.

In sum, whether you are a veteran of Cunard's ships, or are one who appreciates the history of Cunard or of any of the passenger liners, or merely just curious about them, Mr. Marshall's dvd will be most satisfying and will bring a smile, a tear, or both, to the viewer.  And when I watched the Director's Cut it was especially fun because it was as if a friend was there sharing his tales of his time at sea.  A really nifty approach to ship movie-making.",1234051200,2,1093,4.281553398058253
8327797,5,B001NRC61A,"The DVD was simply stunning. Hauntingly beautiful. A fitting tribute to the heritage and legacy of Cunard. The time, effort and love he put into this project is quite evident. Enjoy!",1234051200,2,182,4.903225806451613
8327798,5,B001NRC61A,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of ships.  Yet, I was curious about this particular event and decided to purchase the DVD.  I find the footage very beautiful alone, yet when I selected Robert Neal Marshall's narration to be included I found it was much like having an art expert take me to their favorite exhibit.  The experience was enhanced for me as I was led through an event which was so meaningful to so many people, and pointed out many details I didn't know.  Great shots include views at night, sunset on the water, and one of the ships beautifully slicing through the water.",1234051200,3,583,4.523809523809524
8327799,1,B001NRC61A,"For diehard Cunard fans only.  I expected something more than endless handheld video of liners sitting at docks and passing in the distance.  The ONLY glimpse of an interior is a shaky walkthrough of the QE2. She had the misfortune of being launched in 1969 when nearly everything was a horrible earthtone shade of yellow or green.  She looks like a 30 year old roadside motel made of fiberglass and mass-market furnishings.  Depressing!  If you want to remember the few occasions these 3 queens met then this is a keepsake but if you are looking to explore the ships and learn more of their history, this will disappoint.",1234051200,3,622,4.722222222222222
8327800,5,B001NRC61A,"If you love Ships and Ocean Liners, this is a great DVD! I've not found any other program that has this much great footage of the Royal Rendezvous in both NY and United Kingdom.  Great photography with excellent soundtrack. Fantastic up close views of QE2 at sea, some of the best I've seen.  Amazing horn tribute with all three ships and really emotional. The TITANIC ceremony is really moving as well.  Be sure to play the optional director's commentary, really adds a fascinating dimension to entire program!  A great DVD for your collection!",1233532800,2,545,4.827956989247312
