6872626,3,B00QJN33GK,Most people will probably not like this film. I get it. I was able to watch it with some enjoyment. Tom Sizemore was probably the worst part of the film. I have seen him in a lot of good films. Not too good in this one. The rest of the film was mildly interesting. CGI was fair. Don't over expect & you should enjoy.,1426377600,3,316,3.953125

6872649,1,B00QJN33GK,I don't know how anyone could give this movie a rating over 1 star. The acting sucked! The story sucked! THE MOVIE SUCKED!  I regret buying this movie and will never watch it again. Tom Sizemore should retire if this is the best acting he can do. Don't be suckered in by the ratings that you see this movie is really bad.,1429920000,2,321,4.17741935483871
6872650,4,B00QJN33GK,"I found this movie very entertaining from start to finish. The special effects were very well done in my opinion as it seems each movie tries to outdo the other in that department. Is it better than ""Sharknado""? Definitely. I was highly impressed by the leading lady of the film. Evalena Marie is a relative newcomer to the cinema world, but this is her second starring role in a Syfy related movie. Her first, ""Remains"", debuted on Syfy's sister network, Chiller, a few years back. She shined in that picture as well, but it is in ""Dark Haul"" that she really glows. In this humble one's opinion, she steals the spotlight from her two better well known stars, Tom Sizemore and Rick Ravanello. I hope this movie will lead to bigger and better things for this young star. I certainly hope so.",1427673600,5,790,4.570422535211268
6872651,3,B00QJN33GK,"Hundreds of years ago a pair of twins were born, one a demon looking creature with wings and the other a baby girl with a tail.  They have been guarded and imprisoned all this time by a dedicated group of religious guardians.  Now because the male demon seems to be getting stronger the group is moving them to a different location by a trailer rig.  The group themselves are divided, some want to just move them and others want to kill the creature and the dissension doesn't help anything.  They believe the sister is helping to contain the brother, but she has her own agenda.  Lots of action, not a bad looking CGI monster and a fair storyline make this one that monster fans are going to enjoy.  Fun escapism monster flick.  Better than the standard Syfy films.  Worth a watch for fast paced action fans.",1426550400,7,809,4.493150684931507
6872652,5,B00QJN33GK,"Syfy Channel movies can be really good and fun (a la Sharknado) or they can be depressingly awful and boring (a la Manticore), and I imagine the latter is what pops in to most folks head when they hear the phrase, ""Syfy Channel Original Movies"". However, every once in awhile, they create something so unique and engaging, that not only is it fun, but seriously damned great- Dark Haul is one such movie. The acting is excellent, the special effects work very well, the creature design and the history of is very original, unique, and pretty damned cook. Everything about this worked, and I think everyone should check it out.",1426464000,6,626,4.7
8691644,5,B00QJN33GK,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2014 and directed by Daniel Wise, Dark Haul (aka Monster Truck) details events when a 279 year-old female with superpowers, Zib (Evalena Marie), is held captive and transported on a semi tractor-trailer with her gargoyle-like twin brother by a sect of ""keepers"" who are in conflict with other ""keepers"" over the interpretation of cryptic prophecy. Damon (Rick Ravanello) has developed father-like affection for the girl while Knicks (Tom Sizemore) thinks shes wholly evil, like her monster brother, the inspiration for the Jersey Devil myth. Kevin Shea plays the Catholic priest.

I was surprised by how good Dark Haul is, particularly compared to the typical half-baked SyFy nonsense, and was shocked by the low ratings. The script is well thought-out, the main cast is stalwart, the desolate wintery Northeast locations are great and the films fast-paced & action-packed. The only negative you have to withstand is the unbiblical Catholic-tinged gobbledygook (but this is expected in a fantasy-based story). The cartoony monster CGI could be cited as another negative, but this is offset by the superb traditional F/X used in the climax where the creature looks like the devil incarnate. hooves and all.

Redheaded Evalena Marie is comely in a girl-next-door kind of way, not to mention all-around effective as the protagonist/antagonist. There are a couple of other quality women in the periphery, like Maya (Adrienne LaValley) and another brunette (which might be Kate Billard; its hard to tell by the credits).

THE MOVIE RUNS 87 minutes and looks like it was shot in Pennsylvania, where the story takes place, or somewhere else in the Northeast (theres no verification of where the film was shot). WRITER: Ben Crane.

8691648,3,B00QJN33GK,"I enjoy schlocky entertainment from 'The Asylum', 'Shout!', and, other, ""movie-of-the-week"" distributor-studios.
THIS movie may NOT have the, absolute, best CGI SF/X... but, it DOES have Tom Sizemore. I can forgive al-
most anything---except presidents, senators and representatives---when I'm watching ""mindless entertainment""
such as this... as a matter of fact, THIS close to 8 November/ 17 January this kind of movie may be all that I've
GOT to keep what's left of MY sanity.
This movie, and the reviewers' opinions of it, are all over the place. It's NOT a five-star hotel... but it certainly isn't
a bottom-of-the barrel one-star, either. Yup! It's a middle of the road release---with a passable premise---and, an
excellent actor: the over-worked, and under-appreciated, Tom Sizemore.",1466121600,,790,5.537190082644628

8691651,1,B00QJN33GK,"Awful film that had an interesting start. A woman gives birth to a boy and a girl - the boy is more demon-like, the girl more human-like (except for a tail). Then the plot falls apart. Almost 200 years later this pair are still alive. The church has plans for them. They have their own plans where the sister wishes to free her brother.

Unfortunately the demon brother is really poor CGI.

Then there's a silly plot twist where it can project itself into the minds of others so they go around killing each other thinking that the demon has escaped. And that's the majority of the film - people being shot by each other, someone tackling a guy saying ""It's just an hallucination"", over and over again.

Poor acting, poor special effects, woeful script, huge body count from mistaken identification.",1450569600,3,798,4.6453900709219855

8691653,3,B00QJN33GK,"Even though they mention a vague prophecy several times, it does nothing to clarify the basic plot of this movie.  There's a set of siblings who are monsters of a sort.  A religious sect has imprisoned them for several centuries.  Why?  Because of a prophecy they clearly didn't understand but decided to be proactive about anyway, thus incarcerating these siblings on the off chance they might herald in the end of the world or bad hair day, they weren't particularly clear about that point.  The only point they are clear about is that they consider these siblings dangerous, and they are, but could it be due to their unlawful confinement?  Which came first, the bad deeds (as a justifiable response to ill treatment), or the rush to judgment that dictated they should kill or neutralize these strange beings because they are afraid of what they might do.  That point is never made clear.  Both sides are presented as victims and villains at one time or other during the course of this cheesy movie.  The filmmakers take sides so many times that it is impossible to feel sympathy for either faction.  And with that ambiguous ending.............
This is a monster movie where the monster is rarely showcased unless you consider Tom Sizemore (as Knicks) the only monster in this movie.

Unclear in every regard so they went for some hasty action sequences instead.  It's passable entertainment at best.  I enjoyed some of it some of the time.  I saw it first on the Syfy channel so I knew exactly what I was getting.  And no, a second viewing didn't help.",1446595200,,1556,4.732342007434944
