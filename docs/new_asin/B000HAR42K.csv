8137907,1,B000HAR42K,"There was an episode of Modern Marvels: Motorcycles which aired on November 15, 1999 (Season 6, Ep. 43) with a run time of 2 hours.  I have it on VHS and I have just about worn out the tape watching it.  I wanted to replace my VHS version with a DVD, so I bought this.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  This is not the same episode.  This is either an abbreviated version (50 minutes) with all the interesting parts cut out or a different episode entirely.  Wish I could find a DVD of the Modern Marvels: Motorcycles which aired 11/15/99 (Season 6, Ep 43).",1457222400,,543,4.326732673267327
