5994355,5,B00FK7CSHQ,this is the best series on tv. it show how people work together to form lasting friendships.  The best investment you can make,1385856000,,126,4.478260869565218
5994356,5,B00FK7CSHQ,Great show and I have already watched the whole season four times; and every time I am laughing myself to tears.  My favorite character is Woody.  Its for mature audiences only (language). Its the beast animated show of the 21st century!,1384387200,,237,4.7560975609756095
5994357,5,B00FK7CSHQ,"I am thankful for the CreateSpace DVD options that are starting to show up more and more, including 'Brickleberry' season one. The discs are thick and high quality, and the artwork is scan-printed onto the non-playing surface so there are no stickers making things uneven. The clamshell casing is sturdy, and the discs actually seem comfortable and secure for storage, which is great. Since these are produced on demand, the price is a little higher and the option for discounts is reduced, but the good outweighs the bad in this case. 'Brickleberry' is one of the funniest and most fun animated shows ever, and this collection of all 10 season one episodes is well worth owning. The lack of frills is actually a distinct benefit to me, because there are no unnecessarily fancy menus that take forever to load, no annoying commercials to try and skip through, etc. - just 5 episodes per disc that load immediately and play in quick succession when the 'play all' option is chosen. It's great to have season one on DVD, and I am definitely looking forward to this show having a long run AND to having each season released on DVD. If future releases are put together as well as this one, I'll continue to collect them all without question.",1384387200,12,1237,4.7050691244239635
5994358,3,B00FK7CSHQ,"It's a hilarious show that will offend everyone who watches it.  Can't wait to get it on DVD, but there is no info here of how many episodes, any clue as to what exactly you're getting...the first season could be fewer episodes than I want to pay thirty freaking dollars for it.  Tosh not making enough money as it is??????",1381276800,3,323,4.366666666666666
5994359,1,B00FK7CSHQ,"How does anyone find any of this funny. I'm good with ranchy and crude as long as it's funny, but this thing is as bad as today's SNL. Horrible voices and poor acting combined with crap writing shows there is no potential for the future. It's sad when animaniacs, that was a kid show, was far more clever than this crap. I just wanted to be there when they saw the final result and really said... ""Yeah this crap will sell cuz the public is stupid enough to eat this crap up.""",1460073600,,476,4.184782608695652

5994366,4,B00FK7CSHQ,"The show itself is just as great as they were on TV.  The DVD they were printed to are very basic with absolutely no frills of any kind.  No bonus material or even episode details.  Just play all or play one, that's it.  Video and sound track quality is good, not great, but good enough.  The same goes for season one and season two, and yes, I plan to buy season three when it comes out.",1437091200,,388,4.052631578947368

5994370,1,B00FK7CSHQ,"This is Comedy Central's latest hit ""Brickleberry"", another show that is more focused on offending as many people as possible rather than make a good joke. This show has received many positive ratings and is in it's third season. This is one of those cases where I have to ask - WHY?!?!!

The show features Steve: a very incompetent - and at times psychotic - park ranger; Ethel: a ranger that's more suitable for Steve's position; Denzel: an employee that embodies about every black stereotype; Woody: the oldest ranger; Connie: who's the lesbian of the bunch (that's pretty much the joke); Malloy: a bear cub voiced by Daniel Tosh (a comedian who earns his living by making fun of Youtube videos - something pretty much millions of Youtubers do), who's basically the most negative aspects of Eric Cartman and Stewie Griffin rolled into one.

This show is basically a mix of South Park and Family Guy. Only difference is they take the negative aspects and they don't even TRY to be funny.  Nothing but bad sex jokes, racist jokes, and other dark humor jokes meant to offend the largest number of people.

It embodies everything wrong with adult comedy today. It's a shame that masterpieces like Futurama, Mission Hill, and Arrested Development keep getting the closing curtain, whereas garbage like this keeps getting aired and worshiped.

Overall, this show will have to do without my approval. And for the ones praising this monstrosity, please look at the three shows I mentioned above and see what real comedy is!",1420243200,2,1518,4.868217054263566

5994373,3,B00FK7CSHQ,"I am not rating down for the show, but for the media in which the product is delivered. If it were possible to buy this on tangible media that was not MoD, I would have, but it doesn't exist. Fox needs to stop using this crappy medium and go back to putting out actual DVD sets. I knew what I was getting (which is why I didn't give it a lower rating) but this has got to stop.",1417824000,3,377,3.8461538461538463

5994375,5,B00FK7CSHQ,Really funny stuff. It really surprised me that they could say and show some of that on regular TV. Raunchy humor. Do not buy if you are easily offended. This series leaves no minority untouched. Freaking hilarious!!!,1416528000,2,217,4.891891891891892

5994381,2,B00FK7CSHQ,"Lots of shows try to be funny with low end garbage humor.
The only show that really pulls it off is South Park.
Brickleberry is all the grossest, degrading, garbage, thats  too low for Frisky Dingo, and Teen Hunger force.
I was so happy when the makers of Frisky Dingo split, and the humor elevated to Archer.
Archer is still one of the best animated shows available.
Brickleberry should take some notes on the way they do things.
Remember American Dad? If you just took the Roger parts of the show, THAT would be funnier then this.
Instead, we get every animal humping, junk rubbing, hooker-sex, koochi-canons, drug usage, racist everything, and add that to killing hookers, park animals, homeless people, and homosexuals, and you  get the picture.
If you can remember Ren & Stimpys worst gross outs. This show does that, about every other episode.
If you are still interested in this, here is what you have to look forward to:
Steve gets fat and becomes a gymnast, but his testicles keep popping out of his outfit.
Dansel like to have sex with 90 year old woman. Lots of detailed cut scenes.
Ethel likes to have sex with  well.. everything.
There is a redneck who has sex with forest animals, that is why he lives in the park.
The Park leader, use to be a porn star, and now keeps dead hookers in his freezer.
Seeing a theme yet?
Now add laxative, and killing baby animal jokes.",1407715200,2,1380,4.556451612903226

5994386,5,B00FK7CSHQ,"This first season of the hysterically funny animated series is bound to offend most, and that's what makes it so good.  Set in Brickleberry National Park, you have rednecks, various types of park ranger (ex-porn star, lesbian, college party girl, idiot, and urban street smart) as well as assorted visitors and special guests who shouldn't drink, and a very funny bear cub (voice of Daniel Tosh) from, naturally, Black Heart productions.

8616242,4,B00FK7CSHQ,"The production is about four forest/park rangers, their boss and a talking bear. It was running jokes that carry through the series and sometimes are unfortunately repeated. The extras also repeat themselves.

This is a continuation of adult cartoons with over-the-top politically incorrect, stereotypical humor which for many may leave something to be desired. Like South Park, if you haven't been insulted, wait for the next episode. There does not seem to be any limits as Native Americans, blacks, gays, and people with drinking problems, all get offended in the first season. The running joke about Connie's gurgling vee gets old. I am sure we will eventually discover her surname is Lingus and only Mallory the talking bear will understand it...that is the style of adolescent humor the series incorporates. How I long for the sophistication of the ""Oblongs.""

Guide: My version had the ""F"" word beeped out. It does use the ""D"" ""S"" and SOB words. Sex is frequently shown. Nudity is covered.",1497484800,,996,5.067073170731708
