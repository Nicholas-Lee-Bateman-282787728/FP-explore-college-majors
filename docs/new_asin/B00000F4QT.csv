7907283,5,B00000F4QT,"This surreal,druggy christmas special has Sid & Mart Krofft written all over it! Colorful citizens populating a lollipop making polar community prepar for an annual christmas race,the winner of whom will win a special lollipop made in their honor and the flavor of their choice. A pesky villian named Baron Badblood wants to enter the race-why?Because he wants to win a liver flavored lollipop-whatever. Some want him to be denied the right to compete but the kind Lollipop Dragon insists,correctly that the Baron has the right to compete if he chooses and they have the right to win fairly. In the end the good guys win and everyone gets a lollipop.

  This is a very cute kids story anchored by mostly loving characters. Kids will eat it up but some adults such as myself will still find it a wonderfully surreal,almost trippy experience. My favorite character is Harry Troll,a funky little lavender tribble who plays honkey tonk piano and where's a pimp hat. The story is okay but the best part is the subtle message of equality for all. I think that the seeding of the democratic process should be seeded into kids as early as possible so for a very accessible entry into that ideal this will do nicely. And if your not too age appropriate or uptight you may find some enjoyable fission in it yourself too.",1115596800,2,1310,4.711790393013101
