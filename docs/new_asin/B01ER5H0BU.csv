Mr. Fortier explains how to become a market gardener without all of the expensive farm equipment and vast acreage I thought was mandatory to make money in farming..  I learned that I don't need a thousand acres and a big  tractor to making a decent living as a farmer..  By working in plant beds arranged strategically so that you work smarter, not harder is the key to success.  I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and my husband and I have implemented some of his techniques with great success.  I highly recommend this DVD as well as his book entitled ""The Market Gardener"".",1531526400,,640,4.578947368421052
