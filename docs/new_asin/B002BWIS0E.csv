8362185,5,B002BWIS0E,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL FROM THE 80'S, BUT IT WAS GOOD. I DID GET 3D GLASSES, I DON'T WATCH 3D MOVIES, I LIKE 2D MOVIES. THE ACTING WAS GOOD, BUT THE KILLER IN THIS ONE DID GREAT. I SAY IF YOU HAVE THE ORIGINAL FROM THE 80'S, DO GET THIS ONE.",1441324800,,261,3.6785714285714284
