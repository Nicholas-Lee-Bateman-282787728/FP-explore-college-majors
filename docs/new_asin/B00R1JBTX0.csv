8693678,5,B00R1JBTX0,I watched the first 2 seasons on Amazon Prime.  It's such a great series and a great change of pace from most of the Anime I watch.  You really become attached to the characters.  I believe there are more seasons released in Japan.  I do hope they make it over here so we find out what happens to all the characters who were struggling with studies or family problems or what-have-you at the end of season 2.,1530316800,,408,4.259740259740259
