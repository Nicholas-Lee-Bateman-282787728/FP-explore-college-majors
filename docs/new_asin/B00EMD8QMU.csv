8606827,5,B00EMD8QMU,One of the best interviews about the Cuban Missile Crisis that was ever done. Maria Shriver did an excellent job of talking with Castro and the Russian Generals about what was going on at the time from their perspective. We had come to within a heartbeat of Nuclear World War III. Thought that I would never be able to get this until someone sold a private collection. This is almost impossible to find now.,1486425600,,407,4.513513513513513
