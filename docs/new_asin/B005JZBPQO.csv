4713626,3,B005JZBPQO,"Billy Bob Thornton is the all American actor, director, and writer otherwise Arkansas's answer to Orson Welles with Sling Blade. Billy Bob plays two Arkansas husbands and fathers in both films on this DVD.

The first film is an ensemble piece about a dysfunctional Arkansas family with an all star cast with then girlfriend Laura Dern and her mother Diane Ladd playing her mom. Kelly Preston plays her sister. Jim Varney plays Uncle Hazel with a charge of attempted murder. Andy Griffith plays the family patriarch. But the best is Brenda Blethyn as a British psychologist and newest member of the family by marriage. She has the best scenes.

The second film only stars Billy Bob Thornton as a married car salesman in a road trip with his wife played by the late Natasha Richardson in Arkansas and their best friends, Roy and Candy played by Patrick Swayze and Charlize Theron.

Both films are comedies starting Billy Bob. Waking Up in Reno is probably better of the two. The DVD is stated redneck but that's wrongly titled. The DVD has no extras.",1440288000,,1048,4.747252747252747
