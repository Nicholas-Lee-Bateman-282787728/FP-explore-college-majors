8643700,5,B00INMLU92,"In my opinion, serious Vampire fans should definitely check this film out. Director Jac Avila has created Bolivia's first Vampire film, and it is unique among Vampire films. Take it from someone who has watched a lot of Vampire movies in my lifetime, from the Universal classics through the Hammer Films masterpieces to more modern fare such as Interview with the Vampire, Near Dark, and the Twilight series, I have never seen a Vampire film like DEAD BUT DREAMING before. It makes the genre new again by inventing its own consistent Vampire Mythology. It is not for those who prefer bunny rabbit fantasies of romantic Vampires, however. This is a tough and gritty unflinching view of the world of the Undead, their motives, passions, and occult evolution. Amy Hesketh stars, and as always gives a startling and wonderful performance. The cinematography is exquisite. Five stars. Recommended.",1491609600,,892,5.116438356164384
8643701,3,B00INMLU92,Interesting but slightly confusing vampire movie that jumps through space and time with the same actors playing various characters Still entertaining,1480723200,,149,6.142857142857143
8643702,4,B00INMLU92,"This is a Spanish-language horror movie that contrasts the  fantasy horrors of the vampire genre with the more realistic terrors of torture under a repressive government.  The main character, an adventurous Irish girl named Moira O'Higgins, encounters both when she travels to 19th century La Paz to help in the South American revolution.  Her sufferings are witnessed by a chorus: a priest and novice who sympathize with the rebellion but are banned by their vows from taking action.  The sympathetic treatment of the two church officials is unexpected when one considers that the same company's previous movie, MALEFICARUM, focussed on the greed and brutality of the Inquisition.

The cinematography is excellent, taking advantage of the grandeur of the Andes and scenes of colonial La Paz.  The score is effective, its melancholy strains fitting the subject matter.  The special effects are sufficient to make the vampires convincing without being obtrusive.

The main flaw with the movie is confusing motivation of the main characters.  We're never told why Moira got involved in the South American rebellion ( rather than, say, fighting the British in Ireland).  It may be that her ""Irish"" background was invented simply to explain away the American actress's  Anglo  accent.  Nor is it clear what the agendas of the two battling vampire groups are.

The movie has not been rated by the American agencies.  However, there are several scenes of nudity and torture  (often simultaneous) and it would probably be considered a hard ""R"".  Definitely not for consumption by children.",1466380800,3,1582,5.239043824701195
8643703,5,B00INMLU92,"As Dead But Dreaming opens, it's 1805 and the Irish traveler Moire (Amy Hesketh) is on horseback descending a dirt road. Following her on foot and unnoticed is Nahara (Veronica Paintoux), a female vampire who has traveled across time to reach La Paz, Moires destination.

The Irish traveler is coming to help the rebel freedom fighters against their Peruvian overlords. Nahara has another agenda, to treat herself to the Irish lass in a kind of bisexual vampire lust that only an exchange of blood can satisfy.

Finely scripted by director Jac Avila, Dead But Dreaming takes its shots at society and culture. The Church's oppression of women is a prime target when the novice nun Varna (Claudia Moscoso) rejects her womanly condition that demands obedience to Christ, or if she leaves the convent, a husband. Feminism is also on the table when Varna talks of independence and Aphrodisia (Mila Joy), a crucified slave turned into a vampire pain toy centuries ago, resists her love/hate relationship with her master. The vampire overlord Asa (Jac Avila) is at war with Nahara and demands Aphrodisia's obedience in this family feud. Like Varna, Aphrodisia is frustrated, exchanging one form of slavery for another.

There are many fine performances in Dead But Dreaming but one stands out. This is Amy Heskeths film. As Moire, she is arrested and publicly humiliated at the whipping post (the BDSM crowd will love this scene) before her execution by garroting. Throw in a rape scene and Heskeths performance is convincing in a physically demanding role.

For the squeamish, a warning is due about the sequencing of Moire's punishments. Everything is in real time, no shortcuts, and there are real marks on her body.

Dead But Dreaming wears more than one hat. It is an erotic horror film with a vampire theme but very little blood and gore. However, there is a good dose of sadomasochism in a softcore framework. The crucifixions are bared female flesh with nowhere to hide. On the other hand, this film offers an alternative perspective as a historical drama with a political message wrapped in a supernatural fantasy.

Beautifully crafted with accurate costumes and colorful sets, Dead But Dreaming does suffer from a few shortcomings due to the limited budget woes that typically plague indie films. But they are minor so buy the movie. Its worth the price.

For the record, Dead But Dreaming is a production of Bolivia's Pachamama films. The dialogue is in Spanish but the DVD includes a version with English subtitles. Commentary (in English) on making the film is offered by Jac Avila and Amy Hesketh.",1463270400,6,2604,4.972413793103448
8643704,4,B00INMLU92,"Even though most viewers will go for the vampires and the exploitation features of this movie, I was particularly impressed with the vivid colors ( looks like kodacolor) and the creepy music, which was quite unsettling at times. The DVD came with an option to turn on a Commentary audio track, which I highly recommend after you have viewed the movie once. Amy Hesketh is very interesting and I have always enjoyed her interviews, and I was not disappointed this time. This movie is not for children, but I believe most adults will appreciate the artwork if not the vampires and nudity.",1455580800,3,586,4.754901960784314
8643705,3,B00INMLU92,Not an extraordinary film. Was interesting as far as the corruption of the church in South America during the period. Never considered that before.,1436140800,2,147,5.166666666666667

As  a avid fan I am feeling a repition of the vampere theam is clouding creativety.
Glad I bought this but wish there was beter characture drive.",1431907200,2,257,4.586956521739131
8643707,5,B00INMLU92,"I bought this film from a source other than Amazon because they previously did not offer it. It is excellent. Hope they someday offer all the Amy Hesketh films. I've reviewed several other of her films here which I did buy from Amazon and I always enjoy her work.

Despite the photo on the DVD cover Amy is the primary focus of the film. The girl on the cover is excellent as well, much better looking than Amy and a good actress given the role, a vampire who is stripped and executed. Sort of. She does manage some vengeance and reappears later in the film. The main scenes are when Amy is whipped and then garrotted. The whipping scene is kind of a classic, a dusty square in a Spanish town, soldiers in bright red uniforms, peasants in serapes, a nerdy commandant and a sweating torturer. Plus Amy, bound hands above her head to a stake on a raised platform, completely naked, suffering through 39 lashes. And suffer she does. Great work. Then follows a rape scene and the garrotting. As usual, Amy is more than equal to the acting tasks at hand.

There is a rather long, boring scene after the garrotting when the padre and his acolyte are figuring out that the vampire girl is really a vampire, but just hit fast forward. Eventually they get to finishing her off though just as in the Martyr movie she stubbornly refuses to surrender all of her clothes. Thankfully, Jac Avila is not as omnipresent in this film as he is in some others. He IS in the first vampire execution scene but the girl is so pretty its easy to ignore him.

Buy this if you enjoy this genre. You'll enjoy it.",1393545600,12,1585,4.402730375426621
