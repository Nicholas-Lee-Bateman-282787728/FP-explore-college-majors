8078241,1,B000ADWDJS,"I read the reviews and was looking forward to the spookiness, the creepiness, the re-enactments, the moments of turning the lights down to get ready for a real scare.. I never found any of it. It was just plain out-dated and boring. All I saw was a very basic documentary that can be caught on any rerun when there's nothing else to watch on tv.

  There's nothing spooky or creepy to it. There wasn't anything remotely scary or a must see story. It was 4 very brief stories of ppl's encounters. People tell what they've experienced, then some scientist or skeptic gives their reasoning of a logical explanation (as usual), and then they move on.

  It's very short at not even an hour long and most of the time is spent watching interviews and ppl giving opinons than anything else. They'll show a door open or a gate open as someone explains their story, but that's about the extent of it. It's very brief and very out-dated. This is from the mid 90's I believe when ppl were just starting to really talk about this stuff on talk shows and documentaries.

 What may have been creepy to watch back then has come a long way with shows like 'A Haunting', 'Paranormal State', and the majority of all the Paranormal shows out now that really give you something to jump out of your seat over. If you want a nice documentary to watch that pre-dates the shows above, this is fine to have. It's a very basic documentary.",1301875200,3,1413,4.470817120622568
8078242,3,B000ADWDJS,"This is a pretty interesting documentary. It covers four poltergeist stories in various locations. What makes this documentary interesting is the thoroughness with which each case is adressed. There are in-depth interviews with the witnesses and people who experienced the events discussed, reenactments of events described, a history of the building or area where the events took place, and interviews with different scientists and psychologists explaining how the occurences could have been caused naturally. (i.e. old plumbing carrying voices from over a mile away so that they sound like they are nearby).

The overall objective feel of the entire show helps add to the credibility of some of the stories, and it really leaves everything up to the viewer to decide how they feel about the incidents. If you're interested in the paranormal and hauntings/poltergeists, it's definitely worth a watch.",1167782400,,901,5.435714285714286
8078243,5,B000ADWDJS,"I must admit I really am super interested in Ghost, sprits, Poltergeists etc, and I absolutly loved this video!.
My favourite story was the one about the ghost haunting the two young sisters ""Tara Walker 14"" & ""Devon Walker 7"" it was really spooooky! (It was probably just a fix!..but I LOVED it anyway!. If you love things about ghosts etc. then I do not only recommend this Gem, I also recommend the first two Poltergeist movies as well (no relation to this vid accept for the theme).
Don't bother with the 3rd one it was really poor.
All I can really say is ""Get you're Pizza, turn all you're lights off get a copy of this Vid & the two Poltergeist movies and get ready for a night of TERRROR!
P.S - NOT FOR THE WEEK AT HEART.",990576000,5,729,4.251798561151079
