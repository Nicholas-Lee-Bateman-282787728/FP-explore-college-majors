A powerful message, and the ending is definetly not sappy compared to recent movies that have been put out by producers.",1027900800,3,290,4.160714285714286
1042821,5,6305498725,this was an excellent film. gema zamprogna was amazing. the thing i liked the most was the way she showed her emotions of her father dieing in a odd way which shows the pain she was going through and that just made me emotional. but an excellent film it was.,1017878400,2,258,4.18

1042823,5,6305498725,"One of the first films Gema Zamprogna did, even before her Avonlea days, this movie is a tear-jerking drama about a young girl mourning for her father and trying to fit in with her peers.  If you don't cry over the  ending, you've got to be heartless!  This movie is wonderful, and it's a  shame that it isn't as attainable as it should be!",944870400,10,340,4.265625

7890919,5,6305498725,"I saw this movie when I was young as it aired a few times on CBC in Canada. A few years later I found a copy at my local library and renewed it so many times it was nearly mine by default (until the wouldn't let me renew it anymore and I was forced to return it). Soon after that it went missing from the library and I've been looking for a copy ever since. My fantastic brother presented me with one this Christmas, and after watching it again all these years later, it is still just as awesome as I remember. It's just one of the greatest little movies ever. The one down side is that the main song from the movie gets stuck in your head for days on end, but the song is so good that that's hardly a down side. So if you can live with that and you're looking for a fun movie from the '80s (or early '90s?) that is brimming with awesome, (and a killer soundtrack to boot!), look no further. This is it!",1262044800,,903,3.994475138121547
7890920,5,6305498725,"Definitely a cult classic in many respects.  This movie would probably sell very well if released on DVD.  A great film about finding out who you are, acceptance, and breaking the rules.  Great for kids, parents, and any family who has gone through any sort of rebellious situation.",1244160000,,282,4.833333333333333

7890923,5,6305498725,"This movie, although filmed in 1994 (12 years ago), still touches my heart. Eleven year old Mackie (Mac) is having a hard time getting over the death of her FATHER, so when the oppertunity to join a gang/band called THE CHALLENGERS presents itself, she jumps at it. This is her chance to pretend that her Father is still alive. The only catch is, the Challengers only accept boys in their group...therefore Mackie becomes ""Mac Dales"", Mackie's ""Cousin"" and makes some new friends while still trying to hold together her recent friendship with Jenny, the first person (and only girl) to befriend her at the Rec. Center in her new town.

Throughout the entire movie we get to see how tough it is to be both a boy and a girl, respectively. And trying to be both at once? Not an easy task, as Mackie will find out.

""The Challengers"" is a sweet, family movie which I don't think anyone will ever grow tired of seeing. I'm 23 now and having watched this movie as a kid, I still love it. I'm planning on buying it off e-bay or amazon in order to have it to share with my own kids someday. Everyone should watch it at least once, for the ending song/scene (""Somehow I'll Find My Way Home"") alone! :)",1144627200,4,1192,4.413636363636364
