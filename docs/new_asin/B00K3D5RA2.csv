6402790,5,B00K3D5RA2,"I enjoyed this DVD so much because of the clarity in the teaching which is separate than the practice section for EACH move!  It IS like having a private home tutor in Modern Dance but with the heart of worship and glorifying God!  This combination is precious and so unique.  I enjoyed the different levels of dancing experience in the people who are in the demo part during practice portions.  I connect to different people when my body doesn't seem to move the way I want it to and that is helpful to know what is ""ok"".  I would recommend this to other beginners like me who are not familiar with the terms for each move.",1462492800,,624,4.344827586206897

6402792,5,B00K3D5RA2,"I really like this DVD, it is beautifully done.  I really like how Lynn explains the exercises completely before doing them, which helps in following along.  The across the floor exercises will give any dancer added movement vocabulary, and the included dance gives a good intro into billow cloths, which makes me want to look into billows next.  Great DVD.",1462060800,,357,4.916666666666667
