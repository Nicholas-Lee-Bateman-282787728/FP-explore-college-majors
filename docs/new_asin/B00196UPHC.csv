That aside, I've seen the results of his efforts, and the community should be very grateful to him for the risk he and his wife took, plus all his dedication.",1425427200,,270,4.645833333333333
8272221,5,B00196UPHC,"The 1-hour, 23-minute DVD documentary ""New Urban Cowboy: Towards a New Pedestrianism,"" released on DVD in April 2008, is the story of paying attention to and changing the urban landscapes where most of us on the planet now live.

The documentary takes us in the footsteps of Michael E.(for Edward) Arth. (Arth relates that his name comes from his Swiss-German paternal grandfather, and that in German the name is pronounced ""art."")

The plot of the documentary is how one man, at age 48, fairly newly married (to a wife about twenty years younger), moved into a former crack house in a small slum a couple blocks from downtown DeLand, Florida and began cleaning it out to fashion his vision for an urban landscape.  (DeLand [population 22,875] is twenty-four miles from the coast, and is located in central Florida about half-way between Orlando and Daytona Beach.)

After dropping out of college, Arth did fine arts and photography, and at around age 33 he began designing and building homes as a building contractor in southern California. In his early 40s he started working on his now soon-to-be-released book ""The Labors of Hercules: Modern Solutions to Twelve Herculean Problems.""

When asked to explain his motivation and inspiration for reviving a slum neighborhood, he said that they were three-fold: 1) to find a project where he could try out some of his ideas for urban design in the real world, 2) to create a living laboratory for the book he has been working on for so many years (""The Twelve Labors""), and 3) to rebuild a historic neighborhood where he and his wife could live and raise a child."" He also wanted a place with an historic downtown, located a short drive from the ocean, and close to a major airport.

With the borrowing of $50,000 from a friend and $10,000 from his mother, he bought two derelict houses at public auction for $16,000 and started off with his project in August of 2001. In the first couple months he planted about one hundred palm trees, painted the facades of the buildings, put up white picket fences, and threw out thirty loads of trash. With the help of about a dozen financial backers, Arth qiuckly became the landlord for about twenty buildings which comprised about thirty homes and apartments. His budget for this first phase was to be just over a million dollars, which works out to about $50,000 to acquire and restore each building. By the following spring, in 2002, he had nearly completed the first phase. Eventually the project would grow to include about thirty buildings in an area of four blocks, or about one square mile, centered around a street known as E. Voorhis Ave.

In the years 2006 and 2007, well into the project of what Arth dubbed the ""Garden District"" of the city of DeLand, the freelance writer and film maker Blake Wiers filmed new footage which was combined with the previous footage which Arth had made during the main season of renovation in order to put together the ""New Urban Cowboy"" documentary. This is the second full length feature by Wiers. His first film, completed in 2006, was a fictional ""documentary-style"" look at the dotcom boom in San Francisco of the 1990s.

""New Urban Cowboy"" shows us the utterly remarkable transformation of one neighborhood, while interweaving Arth's progression from artist to home builder to neighborhood redesigner to aspirations for modeling whole cities and influencing the whole planet. Though a whole cast of characters would have helped Arth realize his vision for the ""Garden District,"" the artisty of the film places Arth front and center--- not in a boastful sense, but as a call for each individual to realize his or her full potential.

There are many memorable scenes in the film. For this reviewer, one of the most touching scenes was how Arth renovated a dilapidated outdoor bigger-than-life dollhouse/playroom originally built in 1939 and brought back to life for his two year-old daughter Sophia (""wisdom"") in 2003.

The unofficial manifesto-writer of the growing New Urbanism movement by the name James Howard Kunstler adds his moral weight when he appears in interviews during ""New Urban Cowboy."" In Kunstler's book ""The Geography of Nowhere,"" he writes: ""I believe a lot of people share my feelings about the tragic landscape of highway strips, parking lots, housing tracts, mega-malls, junked cities, and ravaged counryside that makes up the everyday environment where most Americans live and work.""  Michael E. Arth sets out to show us in ""New Urban Cowboy"" a way out.

At the very end of the film, as Arth is walking into a Florida twilight with ominous lightning-storms in the distance, we hear Arth in a voice-over reading a summary of his current aspirations: ""Rebuilding the Garden District was the hardest thing I ever did. It was physically and emotionally grueling and it challenged me in every way. It will take a Heruclean effort like this on the part of many to take on our modern labors of Hercules. All new towns and neighborhoods could be pedestrian villages. We could end homelessness, the drug war, and the war on terror. We could reverse the population explosion. The environment could be cleaned up. We could have political, judicial and economic reform with equitable taxation. Energy could come directly from the rays of the sun or from the heat of the earth. The synergy created by all of these things could ensure that humans fulfill a noble destiny. We could be united in truth-seeking purpose and live harmoniously on a beautiful earth. I am just one man, in one town, but I believe with all my heart that these things can happen.""  (If this sounds like an election platform, you're in part right because Arth is currently a contender in the Democratic Party for the office of governor of Florida in the 2010 elections.)

One of the threads throughout ""New Urban Cowboy"" is the underlying relatedness of all things. Arth quotes the sometimes-Episcopalian priest Alan Watts who was influenced by eastern worldviews, who spoke about ""dijimuji"" as the ""mutual interpenetration of all things,"" and how he operated out of ""passionate non-attachment.""  While looking at some of Arth's sensitive poster-like artwork, we hear Arth say that ""mystics throughout the ages have tried to express what really cannot be expressed but only experienced, but they often describe it as a feeling of oneness, compassion, love--- when you experience it as I have on one occasion at least, it changes you forever. It's a place where there were no questions and there was no time, but it seemed more real than real and it is something I try to connect to again and again. It's fundamentally what makes me feel like everyting is OK.""

This finally leads into the subject that the ""New Urban Cowboy"" is the first in a trilogy of films under production by Arth. The second film is to be about the ""Twelve Labors of Hercules"" on how to approach some of the world's most pressing problems, and the third film is to be about the ultimate extension of what Arth labels as his own personal philosophy, which is ""Secular Transhumanism""--- which is in part the using of technology to transcend current boundaries in human life. In this Arth was preceded by the 1960s media-analyst Marshall McLuhan who was quoted as saying that ""the computer holds out the promise of a technologically engendered state of universal understanding and unity, a state of absorption in the 'logos' that could knit mankind into one family and create a perpetuity of collective harmony and peace.""  The rejoinder by McLuhan's interviewer was that ""Isn't this projection of an electronically induced world-consciouness more mystical than technological?"" To which McLuhan replied, ""Yes--- as mystical as most advanced theories of modern nuclear physics. Mysticism is just tomorrow's science dreamed today.""

And finally, regarding the cover image for the DVD ""New Urban Cowboy,"" we see Arth standing atop the cloud-covering of a hurricane as seen from orbit above the earth.  With a full moon in the background, Arth is standing armed and ready, but this time with only three tools. Arth says in ""New Urban Cowboy"": ""I had a lot of meetings with the police; one of the officers said that I should get a gun. So I got a nail gun, a brad nail gun, and a staple gun.""",1259366400,5,8274,4.901358112937813
8272222,5,B00196UPHC,"Michael Arth buys two crack houses in Florida and creates his dream of a walkable town. You will find inspiration to pursue your own dream.

I enjoyed the gritty feeling of the Florida street and the balanced portrayal of the ups and downs of putting the renewal project together,  the ""real life"" understanding that it takes financing, and the overall airy Florida feeling. Michael Arth has done varied things, & done them his way. An interesting cameo by Keanu Reeves.

To balance the perspective, the movie occasionally goes into side notes explaining Mr. Arth's motivation that can be a bit long. The ending explores future plans that appear interesting but may not be clear to the casual consumer of New Urbanism.

All in all, a satisfying exploration of how one person made a difference, and an interesting window into the movement to improve our cities.

P.S. The filmmaker is my brother!",1213056000,6,895,4.900662251655629
