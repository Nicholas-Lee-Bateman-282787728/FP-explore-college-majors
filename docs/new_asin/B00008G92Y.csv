7983604,1,B00008G92Y,Calling this a cult film is a compliment. It is extremely cheesey in writing and acting. The budget must have been $100 made with dads camcorder. I don't know if I'll be able to finish watching this movie.... ever. The sound quality is very poor with whole sentences of dialougue droping out from being audibile. If you like Sic-fi with an Alien premece mixed with a dash of time travel try something else.... anything else. Now I know why I'm the first person to review this movie. But I hope I'm the last to waste money on it.,1075680000,4,528,4.3979591836734695
