Both mom and dad like the DVD too and sing along.  It's a nice change and is fun and entertaining.  I have recommended it to friends!!",1185753600,,284,4.203703703703703
8044496,5,B00070QQEM,"Laughing Pizza makes music that my kids enjoy.  They laugh, dance, and sing.  And better yet, it doesn't annoy me ( mom ).  Catch a live performance - they are really fun and great entertainers.",1134259200,,194,4.485714285714286
8044497,5,B00070QQEM,"My family and I watch Share a Smile! over and over again, and then we watch it some more.  Laughing Pizza's music is so great you never get tired of it.  The dancing and animation are so much fun you never want it to end.  And the kids interview segments are abolutely adorable.  Laughing Pizza is everything childhood should be -- fun, exciting, imaginative, energetic, whimsical, comforting... There is so much garbage marketed to kids today. The world needs more Laughing Pizza!!!",1127779200,,483,4.853658536585366

This is a must have for anyone who likes having fun.",1108598400,,134,4.153846153846154
8044499,5,B00070QQEM,"I can't believe I finally found something both my kids enjoy that I can watch too! We dance around the house together, and I find myself leaving the songs on in the kitchen while I make dinner - even when I'm by myself! Really catchy, and we love the daughter, Emily. They really look like they're having fun, and so do we. I recommend this dvd to anyone with kids!",1105574400,,365,4.228571428571429
