8239919,1,B00112KZWE,"I purchased this video based on the stellar reviews it received.  I was very disappointed in the product.  It does offer basic makeup applications and some brush information. The end results were not what I would want my daughter to think was pretty.  The models were very heavily made-up and also looked like they had excessive makeup on. From everything that I have read - the trick to makeup application is to look like you don't have much on and to highlight your best features. This video misses these marks.  I purchased several books and this video.  This is the only one that I'm reviewing as it was so substandard.
Your money would be much better spent on books by Rae Morris - Makeup: The Ultimate Guide and Robert Jones - Makeup Makeovers: Expert Secrets for Stunning Transformations.",1246838400,15,795,4.731884057971015

8239922,5,B00112KZWE,"I usually use the review section on Amazon to let people know that I was not pleased with a product that I purchase for my children (hence the title name). However, I was so pleased with this video that I wanted to write a review about it. I really liked the ideas that I got from this video. The steps are easily layed out and I feel that I have been able to apply them to my every day routine.",1207526400,3,395,3.95

8239924,5,B00112KZWE,This is a great DVD.  It taught me a lot about makeup application techniques and I have been wearing makeup for years!  The teacher is easy to follow and the video shows each step very clearly.  I was amazed at how much better my makeup looked after watching this video.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends but make them purchase their own copy.,1205712000,6,356,4.430769230769231
