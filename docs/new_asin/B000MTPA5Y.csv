2747959,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I'm as happy as a musical flea that the legendary Tex Avery Droopy cartoons are finding their way to DVD release.  For years, they were shown on the ""Tom and Jerry Show"" on television and for many people, they were the highlight of the show.  The deadpan doggie Droopy is one of the funniest cartoon characters of alltime.  I only wish there were more than 24 Droopys, I would like thousands of them everywhere I turn.  I'll be satisfied to see these animated gems in any condition but I do hope they are clean prints with no hiss because I HATE NOISE!!!  I CAN'T STAND NOISE!!!! (That's a joke, son.)",1171843200,20,601,4.427272727272728
2747960,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I saw Avery's Droopy set Droopy's Good Deed screenshots, and it's amazing! Finally we have uncut version of Droopy's Good Deed after all these years. I have The Compleat Tex Avery LD box set, and Droopy's Good Deed edited one blackface gag scene. And even worse, I read vhs version of Droopy's Good Deed is edited two scenes. But, don't worry folks. Droopy's Good Deed is fully restored for this release. It's uncut, and looks really great.

This set has Avery's 17 Droopy cartoons with Michael Lah's 6 Droopy cartoons and Dick Lundy's Cabarello Droopy. Plus, you have 16 minute documentary about Avery's Droopy cartoons. Tex Avery's Droopy cartoons are some of the funniest cartoons ever made. If you haven't seen it, don't miss the chance next time. Especially, NORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE is one of the greatest cartoons ever made. And, my absolute favorite Droopy cartoon of all time.

Next year is Tex Avery's 100th year birth anniversary. I hope Warner Home video do the right thing, and they'll release next year, long-awaited Tex Avery dvd box set. RED HOT RIDING HOOD, BAD LUCK BLACKIE are some of Avery's masterpieces. They deserve rightful dvd treatment. But, I think WB do the fine job for Avery's Droopy set. I love it! Thanks for reading.",1171152000,,1249,4.859154929577465
2747961,5,B000MTPA5Y,"A little story...As I made my way through college and all through 80's, I was heavily involved in classic film revivals and film in general.

One week, we were running a classic western and I decided to put a cartoon in the program.  The cartoon I selected was ""Deputy Droopy"".  I have never seen an audience laugh as hard as that one laughed at a cartoon.  They laughed so hard, many of them missed some of the best rapid fire gags that Avery would throw at you in many of his cartoons. ""The man must have been absolutely nuts,"" I thought.

Then in 1979, I was visiting Chuck Jones in his Acme offices in LA and the subject of Tex Avery came up.  The film society I worked for wanted to recognize Avery for his life's work.  Mr. Jones picked up the phone and called Tex and put me on the phone with him.  To my absolute amazement, Avery seemed to be very shy and soft spoken.  He really appreciated our offer, but preferred not appear in public. So, thank you, Warner Brothers for releasing these classic cartoons Tex Avery.  Please release the rest of his MGM work...",1170288000,8,1069,4.353535353535354

2747970,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Since the spring of 2007, all 24 original theatrical shorts of Droopy have been on DVD in this authorized collection. Even if most of them are unrestored prints, they're still a laugh riot to behold, in Tex Avery's own unpredictably wacky style! Bonus features include a retrospective on Tex Avery's past and career, and a gag reel from the shorts in this collection! Since this collection, very few of Tex Avery's other MGM shorts have ever been on DVD, but many are seen on Blu-ray with volume 2 of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection, all unrestored prints. You never know what or who Droopy will face next, but he always comes out a winner somehow! His legendary sadsack voice was shared with 3 soon-to-be toon legends, not just Bill Thompson, but also by Tex Avery himself and Don Messick, Daws Butler's close buddy! Even if most of Tex Avery's MGM shorts never came to DVD, this collection alone is a landmark, alongside the Academy Awards Animation Collection in 2008! Too bad these collections have never been equaled due to the economy going down the commode. You're sure to enjoy this collection yourselves if you don't already have it! ""You know what? I'm happy.

2747992,3,B000MTPA5Y,"Droopy, the old cartoons of the early/mid 50's I grew up with and loved. Tex Avery was a genius of his time doing things in animation that no one else would. By this time Disney had already salidified itself in animation, but MGM was still on the rise. Avery's over the top animation was unheard of and in all the MGM films you can see his animation style that later others would adopt and you get to see again in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" The first disk of the Droopy shorts are all that I recall and remember. EXCELLENT with the same over the top, absurd humor I loved in my single diget years and still enjoy today. The second disk however is far less likeable. A falling out between Avery and MGM left the Droopy series far less likeable(and often recycled) thus pushing Avery onto bigger/better projects and greener pastures. Still, It is animation history worthy of acquiring in my opinion and at least the first disk you can/will never grow tired of.",1438905600,4,958,4.511494252873563

2748007,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Both DVDs contain a highly offensive introduction.

Upon starting each disk we are presented with warnings and cautions that these movies are not politically correct, (paraphrasing).

There is nothing in these cartoons that would offend anyone unless they were fully brainwashed beginning at the age of two with extreme, hyper-liberalism.  I was unable to detect any racism, sexism or any other ""isms"".  Clearly, whoever had the idea to put these cautions at the beginning of each disc has overdosed on ""sensitivity training"" and needs to ""lighten up"".

Droopy is an amazing cartoon character, like Bugs Bunny he is a winner. He always comes out on top. Yes, you will find a variety of exaggerations and a complete suspension of the laws of physics, ( shocking for cartoons, right? ).

Lots of children and adults have watched these cartoons over the decades and I don't know anyone that developed even a remote tendency towards violence.  Anyone with an IQ above 60 will understand the humor in these fabulous cartoons.

It should be noted, that new entertainment like this is no longer allowed.  So buy these DVDs and add them to your collection (while you still can).

His sense of humor, timing, and sheer outlandishness are on full display in these wonderful cartoons, which have been restored and look beautiful.  Best of all these cartoons are uncensored and unedited!  These are the only Tex Avery MGM cartoons currently available for region 1 (North America).  If you have a region free player (capable of playing region 2) I also recommend the Tex Avery Limited Box Edition 5 DVD set which includes nearly all of his MGM cartoons.  It's a French import but the cartoons look good and include his very best work.  I wish we could get a complete Tex Avery blu ray set one day.

And all of a sudden it seemed like I was watching the same cartoon plot line. The first episode where Droopy keeps showing up where the wolf wouldn't believe that Droopy would be any near was repeated more than once. And then when the dog surfaces as the villain there was this continuing lack of an original idea. And for some reason I wasn't laughing whatsoever.  There was some pleasure at the first few clips but then soon after the quality of what was made fell off a cliff. By comparison to say the beginning Tom and Jerry's pictures where the quality and plot lines remained very high for a long time. This memory I had of Droopy seems askew and I am disappointed that maybe my recall is more at fault. So to anyone contemplating buying might consider renting this first and THEN deciding. Droopy as a character is awesome but it seems to me that
he never really got down the runway and took off. The creators never ""used"" him to do more than the same old same old schtick.",1334620800,,1097,4.377450980392157

The second disc is lower quality animation, reused gags, and a severely different design for Droopy and the cast.  Some of the plots are lifted wholesale from the original Tex Avery shorts.

2748076,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I've always been a huge fan of the old movie shorts that migrated to TV in the 70's.  Most people know Bugs Bunny and Popeye better than the old sad hound Droopy, but for some reason he's long been a favorite of mine.

This series is just wonderful.  All 24 shorts gathered on 2 DVD's and ready for showing.  Nothing was cut, although Warner Brothers does have a disclaimer at the beginning of each DVD warning that the shorts are a product of their time and include some humor that might be considered offensive.  Frankily, the modern movie comedy that has tons of toilet humor and vomit is far more offensive in my mind than the scenes found on these DVDs.

This is a great series.  Some of the jokes are rather adult, but much like the old Warner Brothers shorts with Bugs Bunny, the adult jokes will rarely be caught by your average five year old, and even if they do, a show like Desperate Housewives has far more adult situations and comedy.

If you love cartoons and comedy.  This is a great series to add to the library.",1309132800,,1028,4.368421052631579

2748079,5,B000MTPA5Y,"The picture quality is beautiful. Turner did a superb job with the transfers. At first my primary concern was whether they would release them slightly cut, because a number of scenes in a few of these are considered by today's standards as ""politically incorrect."" That's the polite way of saying it's racist. But times have changed and Turner has accepted that fact. The first thing that will pop up on the screen before the menu is a notice pointing out that since we're far more mature today to understand and accept the historical nature of what was p.c. back then, they presented them uncut. God bless them.

By the way, if you do not have time to watch all of these cartoons, I recommend the best Tex Avery cartoons, ""The Shooting of Dan McGoo"" (1945), ""Wild and Wolfy"" (1945), and the two classics, ""Millionaire Droopy"" (1956) and ""Dixieland Droopy"" (1955). My personal favorite is the spoof on the three little pigs story, ""The Three Little Pups"" (1953).

The restoration of these discs was done nicely, too. They look good and sound good, just like those Looney Tunes Golden collections.

I thought the best Droopy cartoons were in the first handful, such as ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew"" and the only so-so ones were those widescreen episodes near the end of the little dog's animated career.

2748090,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Thank you Warner Home Video for not butchering these classic cartoons like you tragically chose to do with the Tom & Jerry set! Where as the aforementioned Tom & Jerry collections claim that the content is unedited, it turns out that this claim is a falsehood and that the cartoons really were edited to be compliant with wimpy modern PC sensibilities. BUT NOT HERE!! These Droopy cartoons are the original versions, warts and all, and I for one am thankful!

As a huge Tex Avery fan, I seek out any uncensored material of his I can find on DVD, and let me tell ya, the pickins are slim indeed. That being so, this DVD set is the one to get for Tex Avery nuts who want to see his cartoons unedited. Although there is still lots of his non-Droopy material missing in the States as far as a complete compendium of unedited Avery, this at least contains all his cartoons containing Droopy. I would love to see the unedited versions of ""Magical Maestro"", ""Billy Boy"", ""Rock-a-bye Bear"", ""The Flea Circus"" etc on a legit U.S. DVD release, but this is still a great set for fans.

As far as an appropriate age for viewing, I think that matter is totally subjective. I saw all these as a kid and loved them, and I've never killed anyone, tortured animals, or had any mishaps with dynamite, fire-arms, or hatchets. My suggestion, If you're worried about your precious Junior being inspired to do others bodily harm because of media influence, rest assured that there is much worse on TV today than this.

The cartoons in this set look and sound great! No annoying scratches or out-of-synch audio. All the prints are bright and clean. And, as I mentioned before, they really are unedited!! Personally, I consider this set money very well spent! I give it an enthusiastic five stars and I wish I could give it more. Now if only Warner home video would give their Tom & Jerry sets this same treatment and release all of Avery's work for MGM in the States!",1260835200,7,1944,4.532763532763533

2748093,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Here's the deal on the Avery cartoons. Contrary to what is said on the back of the DVD box, ""Caballero Droopy"", No. 12 on DVD 1 was directed by Dick Lundy. 16 of the 24 are pure Avery and 1, ""Deputy Droopy"" is co-directed with Michael Lah. The other 7 are Michael Lah.

Racism: there is nothing ""racist"" about these cartoons; many things are caricatured in these and other cartoons of the era and everything was up for grabs. Singling out the black faces after an explosion with southern music playing in the background like these scenes deserve some special attention is patronizing to black folks - it's like saying, ""They can't take it"" like they're a bunch of children or something.

This idea that everyone in the U.S. was a racist in the 40's is simply stupid. Notice how it's never the reviewer, or Jimmy Carter or that idiot Dave Mathews of the Dave Mathews band. It's always some guy they can't name or point a finger at. Leave it alone.

The quality of these cartoon is great, restored or not. The so-called faded look to the first cartoon one reviewer mentioned has more to do with the style of the first 2 cartoons at that time.

All in all a great set that neatly wraps up all the Droopy cartoons which are hilariously funny. Retro history has no place in these reviews. It's like the politically correct have been indoctrinated rather than having an original point of view.",1254182400,2,1387,4.536

To notice the difference between one method of restoration and another is a time waster. Dixieland Droopy is clever, cute and worthy of awards. Butch as a waiter being tormented by Droopy twins is hilarious. Tex Avery made adult cartoons, so they were never made for children in the first place. That said, they are not edited -- God bless them. But honestly, will four-year-olds understand the humor of a dog who gets black faced when a rifle backfires? Come'on. These are hilarious and children will love them. And iif they are old enough to question whether or not the sterotypes are inappropriate by today's standards... answer them honestly. It's like watching Roots and not answering their questions.

Don't let my personal feelings get involved. Those particulars make up 1/100th of the content on the discs. The picture quality is superb and worthy of my bookshelf.",1222214400,,977,4.9573170731707314

I am an African-American who watched Droopy during my childhood in the late 70s and early 80s and was taught that this kind of creativity was the way things were back in the days when they were made.  The cartoon can serve as a medium for teaching today's youth how some things in the USA have changed and some have not, both for the good and the bad.  Today, it is definitely a different kind of USA.

The good:

1. The cartoons are uncut and digitally restored.
2. Every single Droopy theatrical short is included in the set.
3. The packaging style is good & secure - no overlapping discs inside the case.
4. The DVD extras are interesting.
5. The artwork on the inside & outside of the packaging is well-done.
6. The ""product of it's time/contains old stereotypes"" warning isn't overdone in this collection - just a simple screen that explains the facts at the beginning of each disc.
7. There are no commercials on these discs.
8. The price is low compared to many other cartoon collections.

The bad:

1. There aren't any alternate language or commentary tracks included.
2. A couple of the later cartoons are remakes of earlier ones.
3. Although I'm usually annoyed by them, in my opinion, a couple of spots in this collection genuinely did deserve the ""product of their times/stereotype"" warning.

Summary: In my opinion, this set is one of the best collections of classic cartoons available for the price. If you are an adult fan of cartoons from this era, this will be a good choice. If, however, you are considering it as a gift for small children or someone who is easily offended, you may want to watch it yourself first.",1209859200,2,1456,5.424778761061947

2748119,4,B000MTPA5Y,"Let me start by saying that I enjoy all of the films on this DVD.  None of them are what I consider ""bad animation"".  It represents a chronological journey through the theatrical life of one cartoon character.  I found this very enlightening as to what happened to animated shorts over the span of their popularity.  My knowledge of animation is not expert level, but definitely better than the average viewer (it's at this point I ""name-drop"" my life-long friend and Disney, Family Dog, Fern Gully animator, ""The Critic"" director and Pixar story director. I owe much of what I know to him).  Now that my feelings and credentials are straightened out, let me break down what you should expect from this DVD set from the collectors perspective and the Parents perspective;

P.S.; I'm not going to include a list or synopsis of the shorts.  It would be redundant in this forum and not particularly enlightening at this point.

COLLECTORS;

-First things first; as stated on the box, this is a collection of all the THEATRICAL Droopy cartoons ever made.  None of the later television appearances are included.

-Many reviews say the same TRUE thing; Shorts 1-11 and 13-18 are directed by Tex Avery (unlike the assertion on the box that states ""1-18"".  A small caveat in this is that (and this is only my speculation as I can't find any real information on this) Number 18 ""Millionaire Droopy"" is a complete cell-for-cell re-shoot of ""Wags to Riches"" on new cinemascope friendly (more graphic) backgrounds.  This film credited Avery and Michael Lah as Director.  I suspect Lah gets credit for putting in the new backgrounds.  Tex was probably already gone by then.

-Many reviews here state that the first disk is not restored.  I would add that it is worse than not restored.  These shorts were put through the DVNR process.  This process was designed to automatically remove scratches and artifacts from live-action films.  The computer's algorithms detect unusually sharp lines in moving objects and replace them with surrounding hues.  Unfortunately this is hard line animation.  The undesirable effect is the blurring of black or dark lines with surrounding color.  Personally, I would rather watch a scratched and hairy film.  That said, I am still thankful that these films are here to view.

-This is a great way to understand how ever tighter budgets changed animated shorts.  In the early shorts each frame of film is a unique image.  The characters are completely animated from frame to frame.  Using this technique Tex was free to use the wild shape changing techniques that made cell animation great.  Squishing, stretching, bouncing and dismembering were an advantage Tex understood and employed like no other in animation.  Also, the background were very painterly and three dimensional.  As time passes you notice the backgrounds become more graphic and flat in nature.  Even later, the characters bodies start to slow down or become stiff.  By the end you have animated comic books.  Often only the extremities and the head move.  Sometimes only the mouth would move.  To their credit, these later cartoon still (at least) employed full animation to the parts that did move and still obtained a shred of cleverness that existed in the prior films.  Near the end, as Hanna and Barbera took over the production of these shorts for MGM, you can see a hint of their early independent animation and character style to come.

-I can't vouch for whether these are completely unedited.  Based on some of the un-PC content I'd have to assume any omissions were unintentional.  I'm not complaining about the content.  Though offensive to the reasonable person, it is great source material for why things can't go back to the way they were.

This is a good time to move on to what concerns parents.

PARENTS;

As a parent I had to think a little bit about whether I want my kids to see some of this.  I'm going to break this down into sub-categories to make it simple for all of us.

-VIOLENCE:  Yep, there's lots of it!!  Lots of gun play (very cartoony for the most part), lots of Road Runner gravity violence and lots of explosions.  If your kid has trouble discerning what the real consequences of these actions are, you might want to stay away.  Personally, I talk to my kids about the thing that happen (i.e.; what would really happen if you jumped off a tall building?).  I let my kids watch a lot of this stuff and they have yet to show interest in repeating any of it.  In fact, the stuff they repeat is from current cartoons and it usually pertains to a sassy attitude (unique, I know).

-VICE:  Yep, there's lots of that too.  Lots of beer drinking, lots of smoking and a fair amount of gambling.  I have more problems with my kids seeing this stuff because this is where the consequences get a little blurry.  The cartoon characters seem to be having a lot of fun doing this stuff.  With alcohol and drug addiction rather rampant in schools these days, it is a tough one to get around.  In all fairness only three episodes depict drinking beer as a great thing (I enjoy a beer now and then, but I'm an adult).  I don't think the gambling is such a problem to explain to kids.  They understand losing something or being tricked out of something (like your money!!).  I also don't have a problem with the smoking.  My kids will have nothing to do with it.

-SEX:  Yep, a fair amount of this too.  Lets face it; RED IS HOT by just about any standard.  She must have drove soldiers crazy back in her day.  However, I have to pause and think what message this sends to my 9 year old daughter (who is nowhere close to the intended audience).  In fact it probably sends the wrong message to my 5 year old son as well.  This is the new millennium after all.

-BIGOTRY:  Though claims can be made that a few of these films have insulting racial images, only one of them has clear bigoted images.  This would be ""Droopy's Good Deed"".  If you wish to isolate your kids from the ugly realities of the past, that's up to you.  I thought long and hard on this one.  I'm going to discuss it with my wife.  My argument will be; if our kids don't know where we've been they may end up there again.  I think this is a great tool to get your kids to understand how bad things were for anyone who was not part of the mainstream culture of that time.

Here is a list of episodes broken down by potential child hazards;
BIGOTRY: 9 and10 (9 has a very brief post explosion black face gag. 10 has a very clear depiction of an ""Uncle Tom"" like character who can't count correctly and the term ""Blackie"").
VICE: 2, 3, 6 and 18 (2 and 3 depict life in an old west saloon.  You figure it out.  6 and 18 have one small beer reference)
SEX: 2, 3, 8 and10 (2 and 3 have a very sexy RED and full ""body"" engorgements. 8 and 10 use curvy women as a prize.  6 references women as ""Babes"").
VIOLENCE:  1-24.  Don't buy this if you're afraid of your kids seeing violence.

So, to wrap things up....

...PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T SEND ME A COMMENT SAYING I'M ADVOCATING CENSORSHIP!!!  Nothing could be further from the truth.  However, as a parent I felt a responsibility to let other parents know what they are in for.  For you collectors, despite the quality issues, you're not going to do any better than this apparently.  The extras could be better (though I did not expect any on a collection as specific as this).  I still think this is an awesome collection and have zero regrets purchasing it.  If it were a pristine restoration it would be 5 stars all the way!!",1202947200,33,7549,4.578160059835453

Now that I have seen this it is time we got a vote together for a DVD of Spike (or Butch) shorts!  THOSE were funny as all outdoors.  The one I want most on that set is Rock a Bye Bear where the bear HATES NOISE!! Plus one with a cat who throws the voice and another where he is guarding a garden...great stuff! Love MGM cartoons for their site gags and Tex Avery was tops in the field!!,1199491200,3,552,4.0
2748122,5,B000MTPA5Y,"As an enthusiastic but not quite collector-level fan of the classic MGM cartoons, I am more than happy with this Droopy DVD set, though some of the critiques from more hardcore collectors might be legit if you're in that crowd. For one, the picture quality could be better, but historians are reporting that the original cels have been lost so we are stuck with inferior reproductions. Also, the DVD extras aren't so hot but this should not detract from the greatness of the originals. In any case, it's a joy to have these old classics on DVD for on-demand hilarity, with Droopy nearly rising to the level of prime Tom & Jerry for drop-dead guffaws and outstanding animation. Note that this set collects all of the theatrical Droopy shorts, not later ones that were made for TV. Even so, these 24 Droopy shorts feature fairly repetitive sight gags and storylines, and there is even a completely repeated episode created for two different cinematic formats (""Wags to Riches"" and ""Millionaire Droopy""). But we also have to remember the demands of the medium in the 40s and 50s, in which incredibly energetic animated shorts were created at a breakneck pace to support the movie market.

The theatrical shorts starring Droopy happen to be among the best showcases for the cracked genius of Tex Avery, as Droopy was his most enduring character. Surrounding the moribund hound with high-octane slapstick and far more energetic side characters was a perfect way for Avery to exercise his groundbreaking exercises in comedic timing and visual innovation. Like some other collectors around here, I would also like to see an omnibus DVD collection of the works of Tex Avery, because he spread his talents around several cartoon studios and many of his characters did not enter the public consciousness. In the meantime, fans of both Avery and Droopy will drolly mutter ""You Know What? I'm Happy"" upon receiving this DVD set. [~doomsdayer520~]",1198800000,2,1934,4.969135802469136
2748123,1,B000MTPA5Y,"I bought this dvd set cause I remember having seen Droopy cartoons when I was a kid thirtysome years ago. So last weekend I put them into the DVD player, sat in frot of the TV with my son and I could not believe my eyes! These cartoons are so passe! They don't make sense, characters get their heads and stomachs blown away after which they trodded on and away happily. I swear I feared my son could get funny and harmful ideas from these cartoons.. I hated them, thought they were dangerous to have kids watch and I removed them from our cartoon collection immediately..",1194220800,4,571,4.39622641509434

2748125,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I love vintage MGM Cartoons -- and Droopy was a particular favorite of mine.  What a thrill to get this collection in all its unedited, ""politically incorrect"" glory!

The gags, sight humor, plays on words, frenetic pace and fluid animation were what set apart these cartoons of the 40's and 50's from the cheesy, limited-animation cartoons from the 60's and later.  They are reminiscent of Warner Brothers' Looney Tunes in their glory days, and their ""political incorrectness"" hark back to simpler times when people knew how to laugh at other's -- and their own -- expense without worrying about offending certain peoples or groups.  Among the classics are ""Dumb Hounded,"" ""Senor Droopy"" and ""Out-Foxed."" Even though the later (non-Avery) cartoons in this set are done in limited-animation Cinemascope, they are still hilariously funny.

The bonus features on this set include a very interesting background of Tex Avery, Droopy's creator and the director of most of these theatrical shorts, and gives the viewer an insight as to why his cartoons were so laugh-out-loud funny.  The second bonus feature is a collection of the best of Tex Avery's Droopy gags -- which you would see anyway watching the original cartoons.

While other reviewers have complained about the print quality of these shorts, just be thankful that we still have them in any form -- especially since a fire on the MGM lot destroyed many of the priceless original nitrite tapes!

Avery's deadpan creation endures in mini-masterpieces such as ""The Shooting of Dan McGoo"" (1945), ""Northwest Hounded Police"" (1946) and ""Homesteader Droopy"" (1954). However, the non-Avery cartoons (directed by Dick Lundy and Michael Lah) are forgettable.

One exception to this is the fact that one of the cartoons made in the '40s was remade shot for shot in the CinemaScope format in the '50s.  So you get two identical stories, where one would have been enough.
My biggest bone to pick is that this set is billed as ""The Complete"" Droopy Cartoon oeuvre--but it is not.  I can remember other Droopy cartoons from my youth and from TV that were not included here.  Obviously, there is going to be a ""Volume Two"" in the future, and maybe more after that.

Remember Droopy, the mellow-sounding mutt who always prevails with his razor wits and unusual ubiquitousness ?

Well, now he's back in all 24 theatrical cartoons on two discs remastered and unedited for those who love him.  The set also includes the heroic hound's final seven episodes returning in their original widescreen Cinemascope format.

The little pooch with a big heart may seem glum on the outside, but he always catches up when you least likely expect it.  And since this dog's ""master"" is the legendary Tex Avery, expect a bunch of gut-busting gags and hysterical wild takes like any other Tex-directed MGM cartoon.  Always remember, keep your eyes on Droopy 'cause wherever bad guys like Spike the bulldog and the Wolf go, he goes, too.

And check out special features like the retrospective ""Droopy and Friends: A Laugh Back"" and the comical montage ""Doggone Gags"".

This is good for those who are fans of the great Tex Avery.  I really hope there'll be other sets of Tex's other characters like Screwball Squirrel, George and Junior, and of course, Red Hot Riding Hood.  I hope you consider this DVD set enjoyable, too.",1186704000,,1150,4.9119170984455955

2748181,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Frederick ""Tex"" Avery,late of the Warner Bros. animation studio,created a basset hound named Droopy shortly after arriving at MGM in 1942. I'm sure Avery sorely missed his WB stars Bugs Bunny,Daffy Duck and others. Avery's unresolved rift with WB producer Leon Schlesinger led to the transfer to MGM. Anyway,here are all of Droopy's(that particular adjective describes the hound's voice) adventures where we see him outsmarting villains and criminals such as in DUMB HOUNDED,NORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE and others. Avery would later transfer to Wanter Lantz studios,where Woody Woodpecker is that studio's biggest star. Michael Lah assumed the responsibilities at Avery's off-leaving at MGM. Droopy would later appear on the small screen in television cartoons and broadcasts of the theatrical cartoons. It has been a few years since the theatrical cartoons aired on the Cartoon Network. I also used to see them on New York-based,independent WPIX Channel 11 in my native New Jersey also on Philadelphia-based and independent WTAF(now WTXF) Channel 29(this station was part of our cable television line-up until TNT(Turner Network Television) was launched on October 1,1988.). Most of these cartoons contained herein were part of the now-out-of-print collection,THE COMPLEAT TEX AVERY(it was only available on laser disc).

2748192,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Without a doubt, Tex Avery directed some of the funniest Hollywood cartoons ever made influencing generations of animators and directors to come! Tex directed noteworthy cartoons at Warner Brothers in the 1930s and was considered to be the father of the Bugs Bunny we all came to know from 1940 on. But, once Tex made the move to MGM, he hit the ground running. Almost at once, Tex's cartoons took on a slicker, faster, more irreverent tone which seemed to increase with each cartoon he made. His first efforts at the lavish MGM studio brought us ""The Early Bird Dood It"", ""What's Buzzin' Buzzard"" and ""Blitz Wolf"", the latter a hilarious WWII retelling of the 3 Little Pigs, featuring a Big Bad Wolf (who bears a striking resemblance to Hitler) getting his comeuppance from the smart little pig ""Sergeant Pork"". Droopy is one of Tex's few reoccurring characters, preceded briefly by Screwy Squirrel, a.... screwy squirrel who was hilarious and irreverent like Bugs Bunny but with slightly less charm which could make him grating. Droopy, the sardonic and ubiquitous hound, had the charm and wit needed to carry him though nearly 2 decades of the theatrical shorts featured in this collection. Now, It is interesting to note that, though most of the cartoons are Tex's, a few of the later cartoons (mostly the Cinema-scope offerings) were directed by Tex animator Michael Lah, who took over directing duties when an exhausted Tex left MGM for a rest, later resurfacing at Universal to make 3 brilliant cartoons for Walter Lantz before going into television to do animated commercials for another decade or so. Lah's cartoons continue the breakneck pacing set up by Tex, but sported greater stylization, in both characters and backgrounds, very reminiscent of the early Hanna Barbera television cartoons. And, why not? These later Droopy cartoons featured the inspired work of Lah, Ed Benedict, Dick Bickenbach, Fernando Montealegre and others who would later on lend their great talents to H & B shaping the look of it's early cartoon production for television. In the end, this is a really great collection of MGM cartoons (very nice prints, good sound, interesting extras), but just a fraction of the many wonderful cartoons Tex Avery directed during his stint at the studio. I hope that this collection will lead to another DVD set featuring Tex's other stellar MGM work such as ""Red Hot Riding Hood"", ""Lonesome Lenny"", ""Bad Luck Blackie"", ""King Size Canary"" and many, many more currently available only on VHS or Laserdisc.",1183334400,2,2527,5.004750593824228

2748196,3,B000MTPA5Y,"Like most animation fans I love the work of Tex Avery for its rich, varried and fast paced humor. As a teacher of animation history I show my students about 2 hours of Avery's best work after their midterm exam each semester to cheer them up. That selection always includes at least one Droopy short.

  I assume the producers of this collection thought the best way to sell Avery's work is to give the public a well known star who had a TV show years ago. That may sell more DVDs than a disc set called The Crazy World of Tex Avery, but in Averys case they are simply selling a once popular name and not the artist's best work. Avery's best shorts were not cartoons that featured the same star over and over. While a few of the Droopy shorts are brilliant, it appears Avery's producer or the front office at MGM told him they wanted more of the same. As a result too many of the shorts on the disc are full of variations of the same plots and gags. To make matters worse there are several late Droopys directed by Mike Lah after Avery left MGM that are disapointing for many reasons.

  If you are an Avery fan the set is worth buying for the 5 or 6 gems on it and to understand what happens when the boss says give me more of the same. Seeing the set also helps explain why Avery felt he had to leave directing theatrical cartoons. I hope enough copies of this DVD set sell so in another year or two we will be treated to a much better selection of Avery classics. Many of those shorts do not feature a star, but are brilliant ""one off"" films; wonderful works of surreal humor. Avery is still in my mind the king of cartoons, but you might not agree he was that great after seeing this selection that features too many of his lesser works.",1181174400,37,1741,4.213213213213213

I read all the reviews on high quality versus old show transformation.  And I don't see or hear what all hubbub is about?  This Droopy collection is excellent!  My favorite by far is Double Droopy.  I just wish they made more Droopy cartoons.,1180224000,,385,4.5588235294117645
2748213,5,B000MTPA5Y,"These are all of the Droopy cartoons made between 1943 and 1958. Only the five made from the 1980s and later are missing, but this is the theatrical collection after all. I applaud Warner Home Video for releasing this collection uncut and simply issuing a disclaimer about the ethnic and racial stereotypes shown as being wrong then and wrong now, but to omit them would be to claim they never existed. This is unlike Disney, which buries all offensive material in the backyard so that nobody may ever see it, fearing chaos will break out otherwise, and thus underestimating the public's ability to take matters in context. As for the audio and visual quality, only the earliest cartoon, 1943's ""Dumb-Hounded"", seems to have any noticeable problems in the video throughout, and ""Out-Foxed"" had some problems in places. However, the audio came across just fine in all of the cartoons. The colors came out looking quite vivid compared to what I've seen in these cartoons on TV in the past. My absolute favorite will always be ""Homesteader Droopy"" with the Western version of Droopy's wolf nemesis taking his hat off frequently during the cartoon after each bad act he commits and solemnly saying ""sorry ma'am but it's the law of the West!"".

The 20 minute documentary which comes with the set, ""Droopy and Friends: A Laugh Back"" was quite interesting. Apparently Droopy WAS Tex Avery, at least personality wise. Physically the two couldn't have been more different - Avery was no 120 pound weakling. Like Droopy, though, Tex Avery was a man of few words with a laid back way about him. Included in this documentary are interviews with animator John Canemaker, Andy Heyward, and cartoonists Don Dougherty and Scott Shaw.",1180224000,5,1717,4.9206896551724135
2748214,5,B000MTPA5Y,"When I was a kid, Droopy cartoons used to be shown on the local TV station on Sunday mornings, as part of the Tom and Jerry show (since both were from MGM studios). I always enjoyed the adventures of the sad little underdog (and most everything else by Tex Avery).
This set features several pictures which I had never even seen before, including ""Dumb-Hounded"" (Droopy's first appearance), ""The Shooting of Dan McGoo"" (with Red, the inspiration for Jessica Rabbit), and ""Wild and Woolfy""(also with Red).
The pictures are presented in chronological order, so you can watch Droopy's character evolve over time, as well as how the style of animation changes from the lush, detailed backgrounds and fluid motion of the earlier pictures made during the 1940's to the simpler, stylized and less expensive animation style of the later 1950's.
Even with the differences in animation, the cartoons themselves are still funny.
Supporting characters include Wolf as escaped convict, also as ""Dan McGoo"" who chases Red, and as the cattle rancher who competes with Droopy for grazing land.
Spike the bulldog (who usually speaks with an Irish accent) makes a number of appearances, I had forgotten that in later films his name was changed to ""Butch"".
One film features the aristocratic Reginald the Fox, and several episodes feature the second version of Wolf, who whistles a southern tune and speaks with a voice very similar to Huckleberry Hound. One picture features the real-life latina actress Lina Romay, who appeared in a number of films during the 1940's and 1950's, as the object of Droopy's affection.
Watching these cartoons again is a pure delight. I literally laughed out loud, even watching the ones which I had already seen years ago. My wife grew up without ever having seen ANY of them, so was absolutely enthralled, and laughed even more than me.
The dust jacket states that these are intended for the adult collector, and may not be suitable for children. This should not be taken to mean that these cartoons are X-rated, or even R-rated, or that kids won't enjoy them. There is no nudity or profanity at all, although there are a few pictures featuring gags which would be viewed as politically incorrect today, usually involving someones face being blackened as a result of a fire or an explosion. I support the producers decision to include these as originally filmed, instead of editing these gags out. Art always reflects the social attitudes of the time in which it is produced. To deface these cartoons by editing them would be the same as pretending that those attitudes had never existed. These cartoons were originally written for a primarily adult audience, including members of the military, with some jokes which kids wouldn't appreciate as much (such as Red's dancing on stage, or Wolf's infatuation with her).
I highly recommend this set, and hope that other Tex Avery cartoons will also be released on DVD. I'd especially like to see the other pictures featuring Red (""Red Hot Riding Hood"", ""Swing Shift Cinderella""), as well as ""Rock-A-Bye Bear"", the ""Tomorrow"" series, etc.",1180224000,6,3096,4.990328820116054
2748215,4,B000MTPA5Y,"Disclaimer - while made by MGM, they were put on DVD by Warner Bros.  The disclaimer you read is the same one Whoopie Goldberg narrates on the Looney Tunes DVDs.  On these, you only get the verbiage to read.  Fair enough, some of these cartoon episodes could be considered racist, of which I shall now adumbrate:

Yes, some of these episodes have bits that could be perceived as racist or are unquestionably racist.  An example of a questionable bit is when the Wolf in ""The Three Little Pups"" sticks his head in a bag, not realizing the pup escaped and put in a piece of dynamite, and the bag explodes, the result is a charred black face (not dark brown) with a puffed mouth.  This could be seen as caricaturing a black man, yet the skin is charred black and drawn in a way that seems more outlandish than anything remotely deliberately disparaging.  However, gags like that one were usually not edited for modern day (1980s/1990s) broadcast because they generally don't come across racist.

However, occasional scenes that truly are racist were edited out.  These exist in their entirety in this collection set.  ""Droopy's Good Deed"" features a scene where a rich British millionaire's hat is blown away by the wind.  Droopy runs for it.  Spike the dog, in hiding, intercepts the hat and puts in a bomb.  Droops, not seeing this, later catches the bomb and returns it to the rich British guy.  The rich guy says Droops deserves an award and counts out ten $5 bills.  During this point, Spike kicks Droopy away.  At the $55 mark, the bomb explodes.  That must be an expensive hat...  The result of this explosion (now finally seen since its original showing in theatres) has both Spike and rich guy looking most distinctly like two disheveled penniless black men, completed with stereotyped broken teeth and high pitched voices as the rich guy continues to hand out charred flakes and count nonsensically, in overtly ridiculous manner.  When seeing this the first time, my jaw dropped at the flagrant racist undertones; for it not only pokes jibes at black men, but the poor as well.  (Remember, these were the days when education did pay off.  In today's day and age, people with Masters degrees also have their jobs offshored.)

Keep in mind, these toons spare nobody.  ""South Park"" has done far worse and gets away with it, but I digress.  ""Blackboard Jumble"" shows the Wolf as a lumbering Southern Liberal type (now that's a combo!) having to teach three pups (Droopy, Snoopy (not the Peanuts one), and Loopy) as these pups had terrorized the previous teacher (Spike!) into leaving.  This short is my favorite and hasn't dated that much considering what kids do today.  So, in short, these shorts go after everyone and that needs to be taken into account too.

For the objectionable parts, look at them from a historical perspective as well as the perspective that, as with South Park, no race or mindset was spared.

As for the film quality, the sound is excellent.  Clean and crisp.  The video is a different story and the reason why I knocked off a star.  Colors are accurate and vibrant, with little DVD compression artifacting (very nice), but the number of flakes and scratches shows no real attempt was taken to clean these distortions.  Indeed, in ""Out-Foxed"" (another fave that has no obvious racial disparities), there is a horrible marring between two scenes' frames.  The release could have been far worse, but if you're used to clean visuals, you'll be disappointed.  But it's not terribly bad when all is said and done.

I shouldn't complain too much as the shorts that were made in CinemaScope (2.4/1 aspect ratio!) have been released in their proper frame aspect.  W-O-W!  I never realized how much detail was chopped to fit normal television screens.  These were very nice to see.  Kudos!

As for the extras; there are promos for other old cartoon releases - which I found interesting from a historical standpoint.  ""Wait Til Your Father gets Home"" (with Tom Bosley?!) is an interesting piece of 1970 kitsch.  Thelma of Scooby Doo is present, albeit not in anorexic form...  Nice to see Popeye (1933-1938) as well, though those cartoons personify violence in a way few modern shows do.  Just a forewarning.  And having seen 1920s Betty Boop cartoons that were racist, these Popeye ones probably won't be much better.  But I digressed again.

The documentary of Tex Avery's origins and mindset of the 1950s was fun to watch as well.  There's something to learn in everything, even if you completely understand the time in which it was made.

All in all, the Droopy set could have been a better release, but all things considered it's a very solid release very much worthy of purchase.",1180137600,12,4705,4.777915632754342

2748217,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I wanted to take a star away because disc #1 contains some un-restored cartoons, in particular the first. I actually think the Laserdisc looks better!  The grain is the same, but the LD colors are brilliant while the DVD colors are faded.  All other cartoons look better on the DVD.

It appears that disc # 2 is restored & newly remastered, all of the cartoons look brilliant & sharp.

The five stars are for the cartoons themselves!  These are real gems of the golden age of cartoons!  Tex was an expert at throwing gags at you faster than you would know what hit you.  But Tex did tend to repeat himself, so viewing this entire set in one sitting may lessen the enjoyment of some later cartoons.

It should also be mentioned that while Tex Avery's name is on the title of this DVD set, he only directed 17 out of the 24 Droopy cartoons.  Which also means that 7 cartoons from this set would not appear on any possible future Tex Avery DVD collection.

There is a mistake on the DVD sleeve title listing, the credit reads ""Cartoons 1-18 are directed by Tex Avery"", but not all of them are!  I know the last one on disc #1 is not a Tex Avery 'toon.

The extras on Disc #2 leave alot to be desired, the documentary is full of clips from the cartoons you just saw, with interviewers telling you why you laughed. But there is no real new information here.  This is followed by a greatest gags clip show, which is pointless if you just watched the cartoons or the documentary.

 Excuse me?? I grew up watching droopy dog,bugs bunny,speed racer and alot of other great cartoons,as opposed to pokemon,yugi-oh and alot of other junk that kids watch today. You know what?My fragile little mind wasn't warped or harmed in the least. And you know what else?None of my

generation brought guns to school either.

 Why?

 Because kids were disciplined back then,we knew are parents and teachers were in charge,and we took responsibility for our own actions. We knew we couldn't get away with whatever we wanted and then blame a convient scapegoat.....like tv.

 I guess it's ok for kids to watch south park or family guy or adult swim,

but Droopy is offensive. Give me a break;Tex Avery would be rolling in his grave if he heard about this.

There is no reason not to put all of Tex Avery's work on DVD! He's one of the all time great animation directors, and there is nothing here that is as violent or suggestive as a half hour of afternoon television!

2748220,5,B000MTPA5Y,"The package for This DVD set cleary states - well, okay, in flea print three-quarters down the back cover - ""Droopy The Complete Theatrical Collection is intended for the Adult Collector and May Not Be Suitable for Children."" So why has this set appeared in the ""Family"" section of so many stores? Sometimes life is filled with boundless mystery. One peek-a-boo at Tex Avery's famous shapely gyrating red headed female dynamo - featured as a sensuously splayed ""centerfold"" in the DVD's gatefold - and the message that ""this ain't for kids"" gets delivered like a blunt object to the skull. Cartoons in general weren't conceived of as puerile entertainment until the butt end of the twentieth century appeared on the dusty horizon. Then kiddie demographics reigned in toonland. Why this happened remains somewhat of a scalp scratcher. As such, it stands. Droopy appeared long before this in 1943, somewhere around the century's hairy midriff, while war raged in Europe and Asia. As the mini-documentary ""Droopy and Friends: A Laugh Back,"" included with this set, says, Avery had the fighting troops in mind while concocting his frenetic masterpieces. He aimed his humor at their gullets as others took dangerons literal aim at their corporeality. Hence the jiggling bombshells, eye-gouging violence, exaggerated pacing, psychotic absurdity, and bungling idiot con men. Here lies troop humor that weighs heavily toward the masculine side of the scale. Into this testosterone drenched landscape enters Droopy, the cute little guy who everyone, most of all the idiot con men, underestimates. For instance, draw a mustache on a picture of his girl and this small sack of nil, with speech like molasses gooing down a tornado slide, becomes the Incredible Hulk. Dragons and toreadors beware when this diminutive basset hound utters, in stultifying monotone, ""You know what... that makes me mad."" Apart from this dormant AK-47 strength, Droopy's most impressive power is instantaneous teleportation. He can transport himself from Hollywood to the North Pole in under a nanosecond. Though his inocuous ""boo"" carries little horror, the small hound terrifies with his improbable omnipresence. Droopy stands as a perennial reminder never to judge anything by its size alone. Which also applies to this 2-DVD set. Though small in stature, it won't take up much room on your shelf, it contains a brain blast of cartoon frenzy. Prepare thy psyche and keep it away from the kids (on second thought, generations of people were raised on this stuff and turned out just fine).

The vast majority of the toons presented here are of the highest quality and attain maximum toonosity. Things sag a little bit towards the end as directorship hops from Avery to Michael Lah (actually, ""Cabellero Droopy"" was directed by Dick Lundy, not Avery as the package indicates). Still, the set contains no bad toons whatsoever, though incredible standouts include Droopy's jaw-dropping debut ""Dumb-Hounded"" and the incredible cow versus sheep ala Ben Hur ""Homesteader Droopy."" The undeniable influence of these toons on others, most notably Ren & Stimpy, becomes apparent after a single frame. Avery also mastered the self-referential gag. ""I do this to him all through the picture,"" ""Hello all you happy people,"" and ""Exciting, isn't it?"" become mantras. And though some of the jokes get repeated more than a few times, this doesn't detract from the brillance that is Droopy. Viewers also receive ample warning about some of the racism and sexism that pervade these cartoons. They remain products of their time. Nonetheless, Warner Brothers edited none of them. They play as they played originally. No sanitizing or political correctness was applied here, and that's a good thing, because it's easy to forget the appalling heights that racial and gender stereotyping reached a mere fifty years ago. Editing out such material does no one a squat of good. So sit back and enjoy the mania that Tex Avery wielded from the director's chair. He shaped the medium, and his influence continues to do so. Droopy stands as one of Avery's best know characters and this amazing set provides more than enough ample evidence as to why. Exciting, isn't it?",1179705600,7,4207,5.159590043923865

I give this set 4 stars due to several shortcomings. The cartoons were processed with DVNR, which blurs some lines on some frames.

Saving -- and restoring -- these beautiful cartoons and the history they represent is worth the time, energy and creativity of everyone working on the project.

First, the color is astonishingly brilliant -- even better than the restoration color in the Looney Tunes.

Beyond that is the endless stream of creativity that makes the Droopy cartoons more than kiddie fodder.  This is where Jessica Rabbit was born.  This is where the 20th century technicolor realization of skirt-chasing men as big bad wolves came to life.  Not to mention the reckless abandon of letting the unconscious run wild without a conscious check and balance interveening.

I like to think of Droopy Dog as our own little unconscious representative.  There are not artificial manners or conscious controls on him or any of his cohorts.

And the laughs are still there after all this time.  There's the now standard disclaimer that some of these cartoons may not be politically correct and thus not fit for younger eyes and ears.... but we all know that.  This is Tex Avery of the 1950's, after all.

But historical context aside, these are just great pieces of animation art.  Thanks for saving them and restoring them to their original ccontent, and stunning color and sound.

  In 'Droopy's Good Deed' Spike runs into a burning house to rescue a pretty lady in distress - the house promptly burns up leaving Spike charred in the middle of a charcoal frame - Droopy runs back to the house, looks inside and says, 'Hey blackie, any more babes in there?' WHOA! That's uncensored folks.

 10 stars for the studio having the balls to face up to our history and release these cartoons the way they were once originally seen.

No matter how awful and thoughtless, I believe original examples of pop culture - like Droopy -  are one of the best ways to understand how racism was 'accepted' in the genteel and prosperous 1950's.

 What will happen if all the offensive material is edited and removed from re-releases of great movies, shows, and cartoons like Droopy and Tom & Jerry?

History will repeat itself of course!",1179187200,16,1076,4.546875
2748246,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I bought the Droopy set today and I'm glad I did. To the people that know the cartoons without all the PC censorship,I got one word for you:Yeah!

WB released the cartoons unedited,unPC'ed. Hopefully WB will release some more  Tex Avery and MGM cartoons.",1179187200,5,254,4.75
2748247,5,B000MTPA5Y,"Don't you just love Tex Avery? His zany work shines in this collection, which features his best-known character. I'm a big fan of Disney cartoons (note my byline below), but most of these Droopy shorts (sorry, couldn't resist) are just terrific. They're fast-paced, the characters are often well aware they are in a cartoon (they stop often to address the audience) and nearly every gag takes you by surprise. Avery created Bug Bunny and Daffy Duck at Warner Brothers, but really hit his stride when he left in a censorship fight for MGM, where he spent more than a decade creating these classics.

There's something here for everyone. The first few shorts introduce the deadpan doggie, but actually give more screen time to Avery's libidinous Wolf and slinky, um, woman. OK, dame. (This, by God, is a dame.) Not for kids at all, ""The Shooting of Dan McGoo"" and ""Wild and Woolfy"" are as lusty as anything you'll ever see that's sold on Amazon. Avery designed the two shorts with American G.I.s in mind, and they were shown at U.S. military camps during World War II. The other Avery girlie cartoons, ""Red Hot Riding Hood"" and ""Swing Shift Cinderella,"" are currently out of print. (Want to see an early Avery effort? His 1936 ""I Love to Singa"" is a bonus feature on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Feet-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JPCF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Feet (Widescreen Edition)</a>.)

The rest of the cartoons here are more family friendly, with the Wolf often replaced by Spike or Butch, both G-rated bulldogs. The last few shorts on this set were produced without Avery by television outfit Hanna-Barbera. They will be of interest only to children.

Most all the shorts have been digitally restored, and they look fantastic. The colors are bright and the focus is sharp. Extras in this collection include the documentary ""Droopy and Friends: A Laugh Back,"" which includes commentary by animation historian John Canemaker, as well as a ""Doggone Gags"" montage of Droopy highlights.

Here's the list of the cartoons, each with my rating of one to five stars:

DISC ONE

The first four shorts on this DVD are the cream of the crop, and worth its price all by themselves:

***** ""DUMB-HOUNDED"" (1943). A real classic. From the moment Droopy drags himself onscreen (bringing up the rear of a team of police bloodhounds) you know he's a different kind of hero. ""Hello all you happy people,"" he deadpans to the audience, breaking the fourth wall for the first of, oh, a hundred times. ""You know what?"" I'm the hero."" He continually sniffs out the Wolf, an escaped prisoner.

***** ""THE SHOOTING OF DAN MCGOO"" (1945). The song ""Frankie and Johnny"" sets the theme for this adventure set in (say it fast) Coldernell, Alaska. It's a gag-filled remake of the Robert Service poem ""The Shooting of Dan McGrew"" (""A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon; the kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune...""), with a dance-hall dame so hot even Droopy howls at the moon.

***** ""WILD AND WOOLFY"" (1945). Droopy gets the girl -- and lets loose with another wild howl -- after he saves her from the Wolf's kidnapping attempt. Along the way there's a fork in the road (yes, a real fork) and a horse that takes off its shoes to cross a stream.

***** ""NORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE"" (1946). When the Wolf escapes San Francisco's Alka-Fizz Prison -- by simply drawing an escape door -- Droopy tracks him down wherever he goes. Amazingly funny.

Other shorts on Disc One:

*** ""SENOR DROOPY"" (1949). Bullfighters the Wolf and Droopy (""Senor Droopy from Guada-loopy"") compete for a beautiful (and live action!) senorita. About as good as the best Bugs Bunny.

** ""WAGS TO RICHES"" (1949). Spike the bulldog tries to knock off Droopy when a millionaire leaves our hero a fortune... that goes to Spike if he dies.

* ""OUT-FOXED"" (1949). Droopy goes fox hunting. Skippable.

** ""THE CHUMP CHAMP"" (1950). Droopy and Spike compete in sports events. OK, but Disney's ""How To"" shorts with Goofy are funnier.

** ""DAREDEVIL DROOPY"" (1951). Droopy and Spike compete to become a circus acrobat. See above.

*** ""DROOPY'S GOOD DEED"" (1951). Droopy and Spike wage war in a Boy Scout competition. The best moment: when Droopy goes into a burning cabin, the damsel in distress looks a lot like Disney's Cinderella (whose film was, gee, released the same year). A moment later comes the black-face moment with Spike that other reviewers have mentioned. A Rochester gag comes later. The racial scenes take away from an otherwise first-rate cartoon. The slapstick gags are similar to, but funnier than, those in the best Road Runner shorts.

** ""DROOPY'S DOUBLE TROUBLE"" (1951). Now a butler, Droopy teams up with his twin brother Drippy to stress-out Spike.

*** ""CABELLERO DROOPY"" (1952). Violinist Droopy and a guitar-strumming wolf (the ""Kristo Kid"") woo a senorita. More Road-Runner-style gags.

DISC TWO

** ""THE THREE LITTLE PUPS"" (1953). A parody of Disney's ""The Three Little Pigs."" Snoopy, Loopy, and Droopy are the three little dogs. Has another black-face moment. Includes a couple moments where the characters watch a (real) live-action western on TV.

**** ""DRAG-A-LONG DROOPY"" (1954). The definitive Droopy cartoon. When his sheep destroy the pasture of some cattle country (the ""Bear Butte Ranch""), shepherd Droopy gets into argument, a shooting-skills contest and eventually a head-to-head stampede with the rancher Wolf. Has talking cows, naked cows and the strangest Droopy dame: the Venus de Milo, who, when the Wolf takes over her body (don't ask), runs away on very shapely high-heeled gams. (Yes, gams. I'm really getting the lingo down, don't ya think?)

***** ""HOMESTEADER DROOPY"" (1954). The plot? The Wolf (here, ""Dishonest Dan, the Cattle Man"") hassles homesteader Droopy. The reasons to love it? Well, it's got great gags, great writing, a baby Droopy (he's the hero this time) and one of the funniest talking-cow moments in film history. When a bull comes into the Wolf's office and says simply ""Moo Moo Moo Moo! Moo! Moo!"" the Wolf responds ""What? A dirty homesteader just fenced in our water hole in Red Rock Canyon?""

*** ""DIXIELAND DROOPY"" (1954). Droopy plays John Pettybone, a dog who has one single ambition: to lead a Dixieland Jazz Band in the Hollywood Bowl. A loud Dixieland score, with unexpected sudden moments of dead silence, sets this one apart.

*** ""DEPUTY DROOPY"" (1955). The characters get more angular (i.e., more '50s-style) and the colors get brighter as lawman Droopy stops some varmints from making off with some gold. No Wolf, no Spike, but not bad.

** ""MILLIONAIRE DROOPY"" (1956, Cinemascope). A throwback, this is simply a widescreen version of ""Wags to Riches.""

Now things change. Tex Avery leaves MGM and animator Michael Lah creates six Droopy shorts on his own. Kids will like them, but these remaining cartoons lack the Avery touch. Produced by Hanna-Barbera, they lose their fast pace and unpredictable nature, and seem much more like 1960s TV fare. But the color, at least, is fantastic:

** ""GRIN AND SHARE IT"" (1957, Cinemascope). When Droopy and Butch (think Spike crossed with Yogi Bear) strike gold, Butch wants it all to himself.

** ""BLACKBOARD JUMBLE"" (1957, Cinemascope). Three school boys (all of which look like Droopy, but don't have his personality) try the patience of their substitute teacher, a slow-moving Wolf (who now has the voice of Huckleberry Hound). Funny at times, but has none of the deadpan Droopy wit.

* ""ONE DROOPY KNIGHT"" (1957, Cinemascope). Sirs Butchalot and Droopalot vie to kill a dragon. Nominated, somehow, for 1957's Best Short Subject Cartoon Academy Award.

*** ""SHEEP WRECKED"" (1958, Cinemascope). Droopy guards his sheep from the Wolf. The best of the Hanna-Barbera shorts. Very colorful, with lots of orange backgrounds.

** ""MUTTS ABOUT RACING"" (1958, Cinemascope). Droopy and Butch compete in a car race.

* ""DROOPY LEPRECHAUN"" (1958, Cinemascope) Butch mistakes Droopy for a leprechaun. An airline stewardess looks just like Jane Jetson.",1178928000,102,8108,5.07218045112782
2748248,4,B000MTPA5Y,"The two previously censored cartoons: DROOPY'S GOOD DEED, and DAREDEVIL DROOPY, are both completely uncut on this set, the former of which was even edited on the Compleat Tex Avery laserdisc!

Sadly, 4 of the cartoons feature DVNR artefacts (where the characters appear warped and blurred due to botched film restoration), which is 4 too many, but don't let that put you off, because the other 20 range from good to excellent in terms of quality. The Cinemascope cartoons look especially good.

So, it's a shame that it's not a complete replacement for the 1993 Laserdisc set, but it's still a must-have.",1178668800,7,604,4.911764705882353

2748250,5,B000MTPA5Y,"I have to agree with Mr. Bozzo. Warner Brothers should release all of Tex Avery's works. I swear to you I have seen so many movies and TV shows with cutting edge graphics and none of them can keep me awake. They should use all those computer graphics to animate some open eyes for me. Tex Avery put alot of emotion and life into his characters. Get this people. His characters had character. It is refreshing to come upon these cartoons in a world where every character is summed up within the first 10 seconds of a show by crossing their arms. They bore. I snore.

Avery's cartoons were even more fast paced because not only was every character doing something but the characters had completely different personalities almost to the opposite ends of the spectrum. He was a genius with even the slightest emotions. I laughed my bush off to Deputy Droopy and throughout the cartoon Droopy was gagged and tied to a chair. It was pure hysteria and there are times you just give up thinking because you're laughing so hard. I thank Warner for releasing these pieces but let's not put Whoopi Goldberg on these like you did with my Tom and Jerry DVD. My rib cage curled foward when I saw that. Last Christmas I treated myself to a collection of all of Mr. Avery's MGM cartoons by purchasing them from Europe. Thank God they were all in English because a huge part of the experience is the sound.",1173225600,7,1389,4.490118577075099
