7870324,5,630434208X,"After the success of ""Sinbad the Sailor"" Maureen O'Hara was ready to play another princess of Arabia in 49 and along came this story of Bagdad that suited her perfectly. She plays Princess Marjan of the Beduins but there is nothing tribal about her. The first time we see her she is dressed like an English Victorian lady riding in the desert with an overdressed Vincent Price as Pacha Ali Nadim, who is of course the EVIL character that slaps all his subordinates on a regular basis and protects the Black raiders, a bandit club that is as endemic to these movies as the absurd amounts of early polyester silks and gilt-costume jewelry on the women, always covered by perfectly transparent veils.

Princess Marjan has been studying in London, though we are never told what. When she arrives at the caravansary, the man in charge assumes she is English, but she tells him she is an Arabian Princess, you can't blame the man, her flowing mane of red hair is not particularly an Arabian trait and neither is her ivory skin. She proceeds to go on a shopping spree for native garb, which is Hollywood interpretations of what they thought Arabian women should wear, and translates as a Maureen, because there is no other way to describe the costume: weird shoulder treatments, occasionally with flounces, sometimes attached to an impossibly small vest, heavily embroidered, sometimes to a camisole that at the waist flairs into a half- train or baggy pants, sometimes both. The total effect is sometimes late Renaissance as interpreted by cookie boxes that have a medallion with a 'lady' from 'Verona' or 'Florence' but are more readily found in real life at wedding receptions in Newark.

Princess Marjan is trying to put her tribe back on its feet after her father's assassination, she is trying to talk to the Emir, persuade the Pasha, and seduce a handsome Prince who one minute is a camel driver and the next a rich merchant from Cairo spewing precious stones at her dinner table on a horrid night that the Pasha imposes himself on her to have dinner at the one and only Western cuisine restaurant in Bahgdad, ""I Franghi"" (or something like that). The restaurant has entertainment also, which consists of dancing girls. This gives Princess Marjan the brilliant idea of adding extra income to her enterprise by singing in this place which is a concoction of all the 'elegant French restaurants"" outside of Paris by way of Wyoming. No sooner was this flash of genius stricken than she glides from the table like a panther in love and sashays around the place singing ballads. This is the best moment of the film, and it could go on Broadway anytime as a revival with a few extra tunes. She has an amazingly good Broadway voice and when she stops you want to hear another one. You will, but it will take a while.

The plot thickens with so many useless details I can not record them accurately, except that at one point Princess Marjan appears dressed in gypsy garb with her friends at the enemy camp and the movie hits another high point. This Princess can look like a sassy gypsy, tell a fortune with grace flashing that ultra-Colgate smile that probably introduced toothpaste to the Bedouins right there, poison a soup, flirt at a battalion of women-hungry Arabs and she still goes away unscathed and virginal, ready for her close-up with her hero-prince and a happy ending. Now that's ENTERTAINMENT. This movie can also team up with either ""Sinbad the Sailor"" (1947) or ""Flame of Araby"" (1951) for an excellent double feature that will leave you floating in your own magic carpet of Arabian Technicolor dreams.",1250553600,,3611,4.76517571884984
7870325,3,630434208X,"Charles Lamont's 'Bagdad' set the tone for Maureen's 1950s film career...

In past adventure movies, she had been merely the irritable and decorative female lead... Now she moved into the full limelight, demanding the screen title once held by Maria Montez, and more recently by Yvonne DeCarlo, as Queen of the period adventure tales...

More than Montez and DeCarlo, Maureen is a spirited and robust actress who can stand up to any hero. She combines her surprising screen beauty with an athletic finesse that allow her to move smoothly from a star with dramatic ambition to a Queen of the B-adventure movies...

'Bagdad' encloses all the fundamental escapist entertainments that flourishes Maureen's appeal: Technicolor lensing, a handsome, co-star not so dynamic, and a weak script which permits Maureen complete freedom to win her noble screen causes with her own feminine persuasion and many vigorous swashbuckling...

With dishonest dealings among the sheiks of Bagdad, princess Maureen, who assumes the disguise of a caf entertainer and who sings three songs, learns to her relief that Paul Christian is not the leader of the cowardly Black Riders, a desert gang in partnership with the corrupt Pasha Vincent Price...",1232841600,4,1224,5.2615384615384615
7870326,4,630434208X,"Here's the companion film to 'Flame of Araby' (see my review of that film).

Shot in California, the mountainous ranges had to play substitute to the sands of Arabia - go figure.

I have never seen Paul Christian before, and I couldn't decide what to make of him.  I think the picture of him on the VHS box is so handsome - and in parts of the movie, he did appear handsome - but in some scenes, he had such a little boy quality to him that I was kind of turned off.

The sets were very good, the acting quite good (Vincent Price's presence helps), Maureen's outfits were as beautiful as ever, especially the one where she does the dance for the gang of fellas decked out in black.  There was some minor sword play in a scene or two, giving it a bit of the swashbuckling effect missing from the companion movie 'Flame of Araby'.  This movie comes with the original theatrical trailer, but sadly, 'Flame' did not, for some reason.

All in all, I'd put this one at about 9.0 on the 1-10 scale.  This movie had more of a plot to it, I'd say the acting was a bit better than it was in 'Flame', even if co-star Paul Christian didn't have the strong build that Jeff Chandler did in 'Flame'.  It would be great if Universal would release these two movies on a double dvd.  I would purchase it if they did, and I'm sure that other fans of the swashbuckling/Arabian adventures would too.",1171152000,8,1378,4.285714285714286
