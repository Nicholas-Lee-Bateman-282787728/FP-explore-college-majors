The first time I did it, I got just through the warm-up, and I was dying!  :)  I highly recommend this to anyone wheelchair-bound, or those who have to work-out seated.  It will build as much stamina, help you lose weight, and you will enjoy it, just like any able-bodied  person.  Meaning, the best part will be when it's over. HAH!  But, keep at it!",1498089600,,438,4.192771084337349
