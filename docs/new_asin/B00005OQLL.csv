1641557,5,B00005OQLL,"I bought this dvd because I'm going to join the Marines I was nervous that I might git dropped from boot camp because I was not a good shot so I bought this dvd and well I've only watched it once and my aim has improve drasticly. I don't have to wory about giting held back or not earnig the expert badge any more.

This dvd has strate to the point teaching that is easy to learn and understand. I thank it is a must buy for anyone how wants to learn how to shoot a rifle or how is going to join the military and wants to git a high score on the rifle range.",1127001600,4,558,3.810344827586207
1641558,4,B00005OQLL,"It should come as no surprise that this set of two tapes is just the basics, becuase that's what works. You're right there on the range with the recruits as they get the lecture from the range DI. The Marines are the best when it comes to marksmenship and this is how they get that way.",1035158400,3,286,4.125
1641579,5,B00005OQLL,"Unlike many of the other reviewers of this DVD I was never in the Marines. After recently reading the ""Art of the Rifle"" I realized that most of my rifle shooting takes place from the bench. As a hunter and shooting enthusiast it dawned on me that I should really start to make an effort to learn my shooting positions.

After reading some books on the subject I went to the range but only to be frustrated. It sure looked easier in the books than the practical application.

This DVD fills the gap between theory vs. practical and I am very glad I picked it up. There are parts where I continuously rewind, play, jot down notes, and practice shooting positions on my living room floor. To see the Sargeant go through building the positions from the ground up, adjust natural point of aim, and preach the fundamentals is excellent. Use of the sling is also very helpful as this is another element that can be hard to apply strictly out of a book. The only thing that would be better is if a Gunny showed up to help analyze your form... okay, maybe not.

Is this video perfect? No. As others have said sound can be an issue, but also things like the whiteboard dissappearing in the background is annoying. But I will take it as is and not mind paying the $$$ I did for the DVD.

Note that the ""Marine Marksmanship"" book is often bundled with this DVD purchase. This book is actually a good companion if you are really trying to learn from the DVD. The DVD follows the book closely, which is really no surprise considering it is the syllabus for the program.

Also, others have made the point that the focus is on the M-16 type rifle. I shoot all scoped weapons and the application is the same. For instance, the cheek weld method utilized in this video has full application to a hunting rifle if you apply it. Since black rifles are now making their way more and more into sport shooting the application of the M-16 in this video is actually a bonus. Tapping magazines, forward assist, are all applicable to an AR type sporting rifle.",1262131200,2,2033,4.425133689839572
1641580,3,B00005OQLL,"Pros:
1) I found this video to be fairly informative.
2) The linear flow of the information was easy to follow.
Cons:
1) The video is seriously lacking an even brief explanation of care and maintenance of the AR-15/M-16. Marksmanship practices are worthless if the weapon is not in top working order and clean.
2) The Audio quality of this video is very bad. There are several instances when it is extremely difficult to make out what the instructor is saying.",1257206400,2,460,4.691358024691358
1641581,5,B00005OQLL,Same as the training I went through 42 years ago at PI. View this DVD and you'll understand why the Marine Corps still produces the worlds best riflemen. Semper Fi.,1252713600,2,164,4.5
1641582,1,B00005OQLL,This DVD did not play in either my DVD player or my computer. Neither player would even load the DVD. I returned it to Amazon.,1231200000,,126,4.08
1641583,5,B00005OQLL,"I was in the Marines from 1981 to 1985. I recently purchased an AR-15 and was sad to realize I had forgotten many of the very important marksmanship basics I learned in bootcamp. This DVD brought it all back. It's just like when I was in bootcamp. The only difference I found was that I remember being taught to use the pad of the first joint on my trigger finger to fire the weapon. In this video, recruits are taught to use the crease between the first and second joints.",1200873600,8,473,4.266666666666667
1641584,5,B00005OQLL,"I have been out of the Marine corps for 21 years now. I hadn't really shot much since getting out. I am shooting more these days and was having problems remembering the drills. I bought this video and it really took me back to Boot Camp. The instruction is on the M-16 but the principles apply to any long arm. The instruction is from basic knowledge to advanced marksmanship. All the shooting positions are covered in detail, tips on leading a target, effective cover, sight alignment-sight picture,breathing,clearing a malfunction, and more are covered in this video. The Marine Corps way is the best and most accurate way to fire your weapon. This is a great video for anyone who picks up a rifle. With this video, you can't miss.

1641585,5,B00005OQLL,"The instruction provided in the DVD are clear and precise providing an excellent knowledge base. Workign for a consulting engineering firm involved in tactical trainign facility design a lot of our enginers do not have military experience and have a hard time understanding what we are tryign to achieve for our Clients. This DVD makes it easy as they understand what, how and why the Trainers and the Trainess need to go through in basic training which also allows them to get a foundation for more complex facilities.

Very good and highly recommended (improved my aim as well)",1190246400,2,579,4.908163265306122
1641586,4,B00005OQLL,"Overall, I got what I was hoping for from this DVD -- shooting fundamentals from the perspective of the U.S.M.C.. From what I know, the Marine's reputation for training riflemen is second to none so I figured who better to help a new shooter like myself to learn basic rifleman skills. In that I was not disappointed. Unfortunately, the rifle I recently purchased was not an M16A2, so some of the information presented - that specific to that rifle - was not relevant. But I would still recommend this to other beginners regardless of the rifle they are shooting; especially if you are interested in learning the fundamentals of shooting military type rifles.",1184544000,,659,4.84070796460177
1641587,5,B00005OQLL,"This DVD is a great instructional DVD.  It sits you down for actual U.S.M.C. PMI and really demonstrates why the Marine Corp produces some of the worlds greatest shooters.

You will be taught how to properly breath, relax, aim, sight, and squeeze off your shots accurately, and quickly.  Not only will you be taught how to shoot well, but also proper handling and safety information for your M-16 (or civilian variant) and procedures to assist in the event of a malfunction (jam.)

For any civilian that would like to improve their marksmanship skills on ANY weapon system, (particularly the M-16 and all variants)  this DVD is perfect.  I'd also highly recommend it for anyone planning on entering service in any of the branches.  It will put you one step ahead of the game, and trust me.  That step will earn you a lot of points.",1151452800,8,831,4.682758620689655
1641588,5,B00005OQLL,"This video was exactly what I needed.  I own an AR15 exactly as used in the video.  It was time for me to learn the fundamentals of shooting after struggling for several months on my own.  Every one knows that Marines are superior marksman, and this video shows you everything from putting the strap on the gun, looking through the sights, breathing, all the shooting positions, and everything else you need to shoot well over the 4 hour program.  The concepts in this video can be applied to ANY firearm.  I was so impressed with the depth of this video.  You get to see about 5 different drill instructors during basic training teach their recruits in a true, personal, and disclipined approach to shooting.  There is a lot of content over 4 hours so you really want to watch scenes more than once, maybe even watch the entire DVD again at somepoint.  I went out shooting the next day after watching the program and was just blown away how well I was shooting with a first try at the techniques.  After a few more weeks of going out to the range and applying the fundamentals each and everytime, my accuracy and confidence improved immensly!  It makes shooting so much more fun because you will develop a new appreciation for shooting.

I am going to search for more Marine Corps related marksmanship videos because they do the best job in teaching you what you NEED to know with no bs whatsoever.  This might be the only video you'll ever need to learn how to shoot well.",1138233600,19,1474,4.520754716981132

7948985,5,B00005OQLL,Excellent video. I learned several things that made my last couple of trips to the range. Worth the price for the sling instruction and body positioning tips alone.,1412553600,,164,4.892857142857143

7948988,1,B00005OQLL,"I think this is a typical production for what they want civilians to see , I was trained in the 1960""s at Paris Island ,SC and The training was the Best, They train you to shoot right . the film is for none marines ,our class was short and to the point , thin we hit the grass for snap in , followed by range week and shooting to Qualify and every one did that or they got there ass ran off in PT .

7948989,4,B00005OQLL,"I made an mistake. I thought the dvd dealt with marksmanship involving the use of a scope, as apposed to iron sights. I still like it. There are some techniques that I can use with my scoped rifle.",1296432000,,197,4.2105263157894735
7948990,2,B00005OQLL,"Contrary to what other reviews indicated, the DVD over emphasized the basics of shooting; consequently, it was pretty boring. It is geared to people who know little if anything about gun handling and shooting. A few good practices and tips, but not nearly enough information on advanced shooting techniques which is what I was looking for.",1292716800,2,339,5.071428571428571
