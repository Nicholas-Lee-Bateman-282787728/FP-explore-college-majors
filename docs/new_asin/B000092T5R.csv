7988625,5,B000092T5R,"If you don't know what GLOW is, check out my reviews for volumes one and two. I'll just cut to the chase and tell you what's on this video (I have the video not dvd).
The Matches: 1) Jungle Woman & Spanish Red vs Susie Spirit and Debbie Debutante (2) Dementia vs Little Egypt (unusual but no commentary for this match...) (3) Dallas vs Colonel Ninotchka in a Texas Bar Room brawl match and (4) Eight girl tag team street fight - Hollywood, Vine, Envy & Adore vs Sally the farmer's daughter, California Doll, Tina and Ashley. The point of this match is to STRIP your opponents clothes off...kind of like a WWE ""bra and panties"" match.
There's skits, mini rap videos for some of the girls, and some crappy wrestling, but overall, fun to watch.",1073260800,17,741,4.455882352941177
