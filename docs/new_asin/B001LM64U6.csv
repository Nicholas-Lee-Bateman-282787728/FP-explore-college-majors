This second season set was remastered MUCH better than the first season. The picture quality is very good, some episodes I would say are almost perfect. It is definitely a big step-up from the first season release. I also think the 2nd season's episodes were better, they seemed more polished and well-written.

The special effects might seem simple when compared to today's products but I think it has the positive quality of making sure they aren't over-done.

Now if only those same people could go back and remaster the 1st season again....,1234569600,2,282,4.2407407407407405
3685453,4,B001LM64U6,"...absolutely no attempt has been made to remaster the show's video or audio. In some strange way this flagrant disregard adds to the charm of watching this again, but after a few hours of staring at a blurry slightly out-of-focus looking picture, your head is likely to start pounding. My advice? Chew slowly. It's the good stuff!

3685456,5,B001LM64U6,A lot of fun. Seems like they finally got formula down this season and it was much improved over the first one. I love this show and I am so sad that it only lasted 3 seasons.,1451779200,,175,3.7567567567567566
3685457,5,B001LM64U6,"When FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE SERIES debuted in 1987 it wasn't exactly bright on my radar. I was aware of it, and even saw an episode I thought was very good (""Doctor Jack""), but until recently I'd forgotten the show ever existed. When a friend of mine mentioned it in passing early this year, I had a sudden, inexplicable desire to buy the first season on the spot, and so I did...and boy am I glad, because I haven't had this much fun with a TV show in a long, long time.

FRIDAY THE 13TH was produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., the same guy who brought us the notorious slasher films of the same name, so you could be forgiven if you thought this was a biopic of Jason Voorhees set in Crystal Lake. Actually it has nothing to do with the hockey-masked killer, but is an entirely different story, albeit very much in the horror vein. Here goes:

Lewis Vendredi (R.G. Armstrong) made a pact with the devil. In return for wealth and immortality, he agreed to sell to the unwary customers of his antique shop items which had been cursed by Satan. When Vendredi tried to go back on the pact, he is sent to hell and the shop was left to his niece Micki Foster (Louise Robey), and her cousin by marriage Ryan Dallion (John D. LeMay). The two clueless relations are quickly educated as the true nature of the store's stock by a former business partner of Vandredi's named Jack Marshak (Chris Wiggins), who had no idea the items he was selling Lewis were being used in such an evil manner until it was too late. Renaming the shop Curious Goods, the three of them set out to recover each of the more than 200 cursed items in circulation and place them in safekeeping so that they can do no more damage. This is easier said than done, of course, as each object carries a different curse -- and therefore a different danger.

I should probably start by addressing the show's three principal faults to get them out of the way. First, and especially during the early episodes, the budget for F13 was obviously very low, which affected every aspect of the production, an affect heightened for the modern viewer by the now horribly-dated special effects. Second, also most notably in the early going, the acting and writing are wildly inconsistent, with Robey tending to over-emote and DeMay tending to deliver the nervous, uncertain performance of a young actor out of his depth. Last, the style in which the series is executed is very portentous, with a lot of awkward moments: weak cliffhangers, bad jokes, and cheesy melodrama. When the show is bad, it's very bad indeed -- and I ought to add that the first episode of the second season, ""Doorway to Hell,"" is an embarrassing clunker which showcases all of these failings.

Having said that, this is a series that gleefully transcends its faults, and not merely because as the season wore on, the budget clearly increased -- even to the point of getting David Cronenberg as a guest director. Yes, many of the flaws were ironed out, and the episodes in the later seasons had flashy cinematography, better character actors for backup, and an ambitiously large scope; but the reason I found it so compulsively watchable was because it foreshadowed many of the characteristics which were to make shows like THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, SUPERNATURAL and FRINGE so popular in later years. It combines surprisingly bloody and gruesome horror with sharp and seditious wit, while utilizing a family-style dynamic among the cast, and backing up a good-size truck of sexual tension in the bargain. Jack is the wise but somewhat enigmatic father-figure with the shadowy past; Micki is surefooted and responsible but restraining great passions; Ryan is the immature slacker coming to grips with manhood and destiny. Together they produce that chemistry and likeability that ever show strives for but very few achieve. Just as importantly, this is a horror show that really delivers the goods. The curses are full of terrible irony, the villains diverse in their villainy, and the killings are grisly and, considering the time period, extremely graphic and long-winded: you'll see people burned alive, electrocuted, riddled with bullets, stabbed, impaled, beheaded, and in one case, drowned in a toilet. And going beyond this, and despite its humor, FRIDAY was a not a series which was afraid of unhappy endings. Some of the quests were less successful than others, and as the season wore on, each of the characters suffered a terrible, personal loss which made them question whether they wanted to continue fighting the good fight.

A few of my favorite episodes:

""Tails I Live, Heads You Die"" - Micki is kidnapped by a Satanic cult looking to buy its way into the devil's good graces at any cost. (This episode has a sequel in the third season called ""Bad Penny"")

""Night Hunger"" - An excellent and moving episode about a cursed keychain which gives its troubled teenage owner the power to beat anyone in a drag race. Winner gets the pink slip, loser dies.

""The Sweetest Sting"" - The gang tangles with a sadistic beekeeper whose bees have the power give live...and to take it.

""The Playhouse"" - A truly disturbing story about a kids' playhouse which offers a pair of abused, neglected siblings a refuge from their drunken mother...for a very hefty price.

""Eye of Death"" - An unscrupulous collector is using a cursed object to travel back and forth from the era of the Civil War to steal priceless antiquities.

""Face of Evil"" - A cursed compact allows a fading model to rid herself of her young rivals in hideously brutal ways.

""Better off Dead"" - Even by today's standards this story, about a doctor who kidnaps prostitutes and experiments on them with a cursed syringe, is shockingly brutal, the moreso because the doctor is not so much evil or sadistic as desperate.

""Scarlet Cinema"" - In a homage to ""The Wolf Man,"" this story revolves around a film-school loser whose cursed object, a camera, allows him to summon a werewolf right out of Hollywood's cinematic past.

""The Mephisto Ring"" - Yet another story featuring the excellent character actor Denis Forest, who made many appearances on the show; this one puts a degenerate gambler in hock to the mob in possession of a cursed ring that foresees the outcome of sports events.

""The Butcher"" - Chris Wiggins gets to do all the heavy lifting in this episode that pits Jack Marshak against a resurrected Nazi war criminal he killed in the waning days of WW2.

""Mesmer's Bauble"" - 1980s pop-siren Vanity guest stars in an episode with -- again! -- Denis Forest as an obsessed fan whose cursed object, a pendant, allows him to get very close to her...so close you might not be able to tell them apart.

""The Maestro"" -- The first appearance by coldly competent Colm Fiore in this series (he returns in Season Three's excellent ""Mightier Than The Sword"") is a fascinating story about a crippled dance master whose cursed music box literally causes people to ""dance 'til they drop."" Dead.

""The Shaman's Apprentice"" - This gut-wrenching episode features an Indian physician who cures patients using a cursed totem that demands a death for a life: a stinging attack on racism that presents a cruel moral dilemma to our heroes: if they stop the doctor, they condemn a terminally ill friend of Micki's to death.

As I said, FRIDAY is a series with many flaws, but at the same time I found it compulsively watchable and a great deal of fun. It not only delivers the sort of old-school horror-movie atmosphere I greatly enjoy, it clearly had an enormous influence, directly or indirectly, on people like Chris Carter, Joss Whedon, Tim Kring, David Greenwalt, and others who enjoyed considerably more pop-culture fame with their own shows. And this, the second season, is arguably the best of all three. It has everything you could want: horror, suspense, drama, sex, gore, nastily ironic curses, and ethical dilemmas from which there is absolutely no escape. It also introduces Johnny Ventura (Steve Monarque) as a recurring character who, at the beginning of the third season, steps in for the departing Ryan Dallion. So what are you waiting for? Take a trip down to Druid Street to Curious Goods and say hello.

But for God's sake don't buy anything.",1448582400,3,8242,4.770526315789474
3685458,5,B001LM64U6,"Glad to complete my collection of Friday the 13th: The Series with season 2! Cheesy acting, flimsy plot lines, and terrible F/X but as anyone who's read my previous reviews will know I love this sort of thing! Louise Robey is resplendent in 80's hotness, and the stories are interesting even if they ask you to seriously suspend disbelief. The last season with Ryan as Mickey's (Louise Robey) sidekick, which makes it the last really good season in my book. Worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of cheesy 80's stuff, and if you can stomach the $9 price! Love this one.",1445817600,,573,4.572815533980583

That' being said, there's still tons of episodes here that are worthwhile and juicy.  Symphony in B, 13 O'clock, The Sweetest Sting, The Maestro, and one of my favorites Face of Evil all make Season 2 worth purchasing. Some episodes disappointed me a tad with boredom, such as Wedding in Black and Eye of Death, so a 4/5 seemed fair to me. Still a necessity in my DVD collection.",1414281600,2,545,4.333333333333333

3685478,5,B001LM64U6,"The writers of this series really came up with some great little hair-raising stories to creep you out with on this season of Friday the 13th the Series. Some of these episodes are so good that they are better than some full-length Horror movies that I have seen. Just a lot of really entertaining and spooky, thought-provoking, edge-of-your-seat little thrillers.

Louise Robey, Chris Wiggins, and John D. LeMay all return to play Micki Foster, Jack Marshak, and Ryan Dallion, a trio of antique dealers who face many deadly challenges in their attempts to collect the cursed relics that their evil uncle Lewis Vendredi unleashed upon the world with his unholy pact with the Devil.

This series was so good that it's hard to believe that it only ran for 3 seasons?",1333411200,2,764,4.824427480916031
3685479,5,B001LM64U6,"Just received this set a day ago.  Ran tests on the picture quality starting with a standard DVD player/recorder and a blu-ray player.  On my 42 inch plasma, the picture looked fine on both players with a slight improvement with the blu-ray upscaling.  The opening title was nice and sharp (based on the text) but right toward the end the smoke that appeared rendered the picture somewhat soft.  This series uses an over-abundance of smoke/haze/fog which makes the picture grainy.  In fact, the antique shop is always smoky in the background.  Sharpening this haze won't improve the picture.  Also tested the picture quality with a standard DVD player connected to a late-80's 31 inch tube TV by an old video cable from the 80's.  Watching a late 80's program on a late 80's TV was a nice nostalgia trip but the picture was grainy esp. in the hazy parts.  Maybe the change of cast from season 2 to season 3 was due to excessive smoke inhalation.  Bottom line is the DVD picture is as good as it can be with Friday the 13th.",1332201600,,1023,4.540983606557377

3685481,4,B001LM64U6,"The show itself is a good ride! It's over the top, improbable situations, over acting, but great fun all the same. How they got away with some of the violence on TV is a mystery!

The first story in this set is not very good. There is another about a violin I wasn't real crazy about.

But then they take off! My favorites  are the one about the stop watch, the World Series ring, and the coin, and the syringe.

If the sets sold for around $15, then so be what you buy here. But they are priced $25 and up, and when you see the quality, you feel a little taken advantage of.

The problem rests in the picture quality. Different reviewers have had multiple expalnations, but for what the series is costing on DVD, the price should either be lowered to the actual quality, ot the DVD's should be remastered using one of the multiple ways out ther to improve the picture and sound.",1298592000,2,879,4.271084337349397
3685482,5,B001LM64U6,"Glad this is available on dvd finally. And i don't think the dark quality a number of you have a problem with was a duplication error. Such a dark, uneven tone was one of the things i enjoyed about the series; it set the mood and made many an 80's Sat. morning deliciously creepy... a fun addition to the frivolity of the time. The other great thing about the series is the detail. From set decoration to smallest character, that attention to nuance, even of otherwise over the top characters, allows you to develop empathy for each one and care about the story. That's a skill current filmmakers, especially American, could do well to emulate. There was also some really good performances and character development from many really good actors! I'm thankful Mancusso made as many sordid, joyful little yarns for me to revisit as he did :)",1272844800,,839,4.675675675675675
3685483,4,B001LM64U6,"It's been ages since I last saw this great little horror series on TV, but the entertainment value still holds up on a DVD format.  It's a shame that the ""Lewis Vendredi pact with the devil""  introduction to each episode was omitted, along with any interesting bonus materials for this re-release.
The premise of recovering cursed antique's is a clever one, and the 1989 special effects are still very effective for supporting the story line.
The price for one entire season was  reasonable, and the picture quality  acceptable.
 I would recommend this product and will probably buy the other two seasons.",1251763200,2,605,4.9504950495049505

3685487,4,B001LM64U6,"The reason the show looks the way it does is because of the era. Many shows in the '80s were shot on film and then edited on videotape, which gives it that fuzzy look. It's a lot easier to restore film than video. It's sad it looks this way, but that's just the way it is. Some of you have mentioned that Twin Peaks is amazing restoration - that's because it was shot and edited on film.

I wish the show looked better, but I'm still happy to have them, especially since I never thought Paramount would release them. Be honest: Did you ever think this would be released?",1242172800,20,570,4.229357798165138
3685488,3,B001LM64U6,"""Friday the 13th: The Series"" is one of my favorite shows of all time; let's get that out of the way first. I rated the first season's DVD release low because of poor video quality, the absence of the 'saga sell' at episode's start, and the threadbare extras. So how did this release, just months after the previous one, fare?

The good news is that the video quality is better than in the previous set. (The last set looks better when you watch it on Chiller than on the DVDs!) The bad news is that the 'saga sell' (""Lewis Vendredi made a deal with the devil, to sell cursed antiques..."") is still nowhere in sight, and this set has even *fewer* extras than the previous one.

On the plus side, the episodes here are better than in the last set, and I'm happy to say the episode ""Mesmer's Bauble"" is intact, music and all. It was feared to be missing from this set because of guest star Vanity's condemnation of her appearance (leading to the show's not having aired in the U.S. for some time).

I still think Paramount can get it right with the third and final set, whenever it appears. I already sent my letter to their DVD division voicing my displeasure for this and the previous set. Surely we can hope for the saga sell to be restored on the intact, two-hour ""The Prophecies"" (season 3's premiere episode)?

Rating: Three stars (average).

With the lack of quality programming nowdays this has become a classic.

I might be getting off-track here, but let me say that I consider Louise Robey to be quite a beautiful woman. I cannot imagine any other female taking her place in this program. The director may have gone a bit overboard with some of Robey's outfits in the first season, but that didn't detract from her beauty; and in the second season the outfits were all very tasteful. I won't list favorite episodes since I consider all of them to be great and I don't want to detract from the entire package.

Some of the bad guys in particular went on to better known parts such as the the vampire master in Forever Night and he also played Prince in the oddball series Lexx.
