4984606,3,B006EMSO74,"I notice that there are some people who assume that only Dennis DeYoung lovers are responsible for all comments panning the current lineup's recordings. Not true. I own every recording Styx has ever published, and have attended concerts including every lineup. It's simple, Lawrence Gowan just isn't a great vocalist. There is no no need to compare him to Dennis in order to recognize that fact.

October 17, 2012
I want to make it clear that I have edited this review based on listening to the CD's, watching the DVD and seeing them in concert again since my original review. Let's be clear about what this is: it is an opinion piece regarding the re-release of Styx: Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight - Live [Blu-ray]. I have been a Styx fan since 1975 and have seen every lineup they have ever put on stage. I will admit that the gaffs that Lawrence Gowan commits on stage have been ""fixed"" in these recordings for the most part. This review is not about the state of the band beyond what they have recorded in this effort. I don't care about the politics and hand wringing. I am simply stating that while this is the current lineup's best effort to date, it still doesn't give the music on these albums their full due. Close, but not quite.

I did send them a thank you note however for releasing remastered audiophile vinyl versions of these albums. NOW, they are AWESOME!

I wish I could have any of you who decide to hate on me for my heartfelt review over for a listening party. Then we could debate the nitty gritty of our opinions, and hopefully come to a mutual understanding.",1326240000,7,1586,4.519163763066202

4984608,1,B006EMSO74,"Had Dennis DeYoung still been a KEY member (It's NOT Styx without him) I would pay $100 for this blu ray.

Sorry guys, I don't want it.

To all you me bashers-

The ONLY original member in this band is James Young-Tommy Shaw did not join til the 6th studio album. John Panozzo died Chuck quit and then there is no Dennis and without Dennis there is NO Styx.

This is a Styx cover band NOT the original so STOP your whinin and do a lil research before you bitch.

This is why I don't want it.",1325808000,17,491,4.020618556701031

4984611,5,B006EMSO74,"Since everyone is reviewing this before it even comes out, I figured I would put my two cents in since I actually saw the tour live....

It was fantastic... Sounded as good as the original album if not better. Styx always puts on a good show and MOST of the original guys are in the band... Yeah the drummer isn't original but he died and Todd Sucherman is AMAZING! Yeah Dennis isn't there... but Lawrence Gowan brings something new and exciting into the band. They have fun on stage and true fans have fun watching them.

I can't wait to see this dvd and relive what was one of the coolest concept tours and one of the best sounding concerts I've ever been to. I've seen hundreds of bands live but Styx has something special that makes me keep going to see them every year. If you don't like them.... don't waste your time reviewing their dvd. Go do something productive because true fans don't care what you think. They know how awesome the band is!",1325721600,25,951,4.3977272727272725
4984612,2,B006EMSO74,"I agree with David.  This isn't Styx, and never will be, no matter how hard the band tries to say they are.  And they TRY hard by acting as if nothing has changed.  It has.

I think the reason why some (ex) Styx fans dislike this product and other product like it (re-generation, countless live albums, etc) is that for a band claiming they want to move on, they are doing anything but.  You can't compare ""new-Styx"" to a band that lost a ""non-key"" member, a member who died or left for health issues, or a member who left a band voluntarily.  This is a band that is re-recording classic songs made when ""key member"" Dennis was in the band, and acting as if Dennis was not important and/or never existed.  NONE of the other bands bass boy mentions do this, and/or to this extent.  No other band has this much DISRESPECT for a former KEY, founding member.

An equivalent to the way this band acts would be if Gilmour Mason and Wright FIRED Waters and hired a singer and bass player who sounds like him, removed all mention of Waters from the band's website, referring to him only as their former bass player, bring in another keyboard player after Wright died, call the band Pink Floyd, take to the road and perform the Wall live!  Then release a DVD Pink Floyd the Wall live.  All over Water's objections and/or desire to be in the band!

If a band wants to move on after a key member voluntarily leaves, I'm fine with that.  But MOVE ON.  Such as Black Sabbath did with Dio, or Van Halen did when they got Sammy Hagar.  Did they re-record a live version of the Paranoid album or the 1984 album with 40% of the band that originally recorded them?  No!

What's the point of this anyway?  This isn't a new approach to these albums, it doesn't offer anything new or better than the originals.  I'll tell you- it's to redo them without Dennis, and like everything else this band does these days, an attempt to convince people and themselves that Dennis didn't matter.  All for JY and Shaw's egos, I imagine.

I (and maybe some other fans) could possibly accept this band as Styx if A) Dennis stated he no longer wanted to be in the band  B) They acknowledge the huge impact Dennis had, but state they wish to continue making music C) they create some decent new music and D) stop trying to re-write history with crap like this.  Since this is not the case (Dennis WANTS to be in the band) then I (and many others) cannot support the band without him.  It's that simple.  It doesn't matter how long it's been since they FIRED Dennis, I will never support this band again, until they get him back, especially with releases like this.

So again, I agree with David- this angers me.  This is a slap in the face to Dennis and all of his fans, which means many (former) Styx fans.  It's disrespectful and egotistical.  This is beyond a band trying to move on because a member (voluntarily) left, this is childish egotistical games meant to hurt a former founding KEY member that they FIRED.  Don't think they don't know how Dennis will feel about this- they don't care.  And don't think the band did this because fans wanted it- they don't, and the band doesn't care.  JY & Tommy Shaw do not care about Dennis or their fans, they care about themselves and feeding their egos, and attempting to continue the ""illusion"" that this is Styx.  It isn't.  Don't be fooled, or support it, or Tommy's and JYs childish games.",1325548800,16,3405,4.429951690821256
4984613,4,B006EMSO74,"I am puzzled why all the hate for the modern-day Styx. I'm a DDY fan but let's admit it, DDY has been out of the band for well over 12 years, people.
Would I rather have DDY in Styx today? Sure. Do I hate Lawrence Gowan or Tommy Shaw or James JY Young for DDY's absence? No.
If this DVD is anything like the July 2011 concert I saw by Styx, it will be really great. Yeah, I sorta missed DDY at the 2011 show, but Gowan is a good showman, and the rest of the band also put on a great show (Shaw and Young handle most of the lead vocals in Styx's concerts these days, with Gowan only singing three (or maybe four)songs. And it's cool to see former Babys bassist Ricky Phillips thump the five string (Chuck Ponozzo is still a member of Styx but can only play so much live due to his health.)

I don't know, I guess I am tiring of hearing the complaints that DDY is no longer in Styx, just like those who argue that Kiss shouldn't tour without Ace Frehley (who doesn't want to be in Kiss) and Peter Criss (who might want to be back in but has health issues that prevent him from touring extensively; a friend of mine who is a diehard Kiss fan saw one of Kiss' last shows with Peter and said he loves Peter, but Peter was struggling through the show, even on just the simple cowbell intro of ""Calling Dr. Love."")

I dig the 1970s Styx, but I also am a fan of Styx's current lineup.  :)",1325462400,21,1380,4.0476190476190474

He wasn't the only guy in the band (3 or 5 of the players that were on these albums are in this concert, another is dead). While it would be nice to have DDY here,  Lawrence Gowan is an extremely worthy replacement. Few groups (AC/DC comes to mind) could replace one of their leads and still have ""their sound"". This concert was done in 2010 in Nashville, and it was fantastic. To do these two albums live, back to back in the order the tracks were on the platters, and sound this good is simply ... amazing. We enjoyed this so much that my wife, sons and I have already watched it 3 times this week. The music is just that good. The only thing missing, and I'm not deducting for it, is the subtitles. When this aired on cable/dish, you got subtitles, but even though the disc offers the option, I've found no way to enable it.

The band performs top notch and the quality of the Blu-ray is top notch. The picture quality is so clear and several cameras were used so you always have a great view of the band. The concert is about 2 hours, as they play both albums in their entirety. The bonus features show you behind the scenes, all the people involved in putting on a Styx concert.

It's a great buy for $12. In terms of picture and sound quality, it's gotta be Styx's best concert film (and they have many). Other Styx concert films contain more hit songs though, as all the B-side songs are performed here from those albums.

Lastly, I really hate all the negative comments I've read about Gowan not being Dennis DeYoung. Noone sounds like DDY vocally, so it's unfair to criticize him for that. Gowan CAN sing all the notes and he plays the keyboards as well as DDY (maybe even better?). He's learned all the parts properly and he fits in with the band wonderfully. He deserves credit, not criticism. The man is very talented, as is Tommy Shaw and the rest of Styx.

4984665,5,B006EMSO74,"This BluRay of the two best STYX Albums has been a big part of my life in the past  2 years. I listen to the music on headphones when I'm out in the yard or I watch it on my home theater when I'm inside. So, I've heard / watched this BluRay over two hundred times. When I first saw this dvd on Amazon, I noticed that Lawrence Gowan was in the band. I like him and I have the two albums STYX was playing, so I decided to buy it. The first time I watched it, I immediately loved the Star Wars intro and the young guy who put on the headphones to start listening to the music. The Grand Illusion song starts a little bit distorted but it's fixed quickly. Then I hear Lawrence singing and he sounds great. And that revolving keyboard is very cool. But then the song gets to Tommy's part and I'm blown away. Then JY blows me away with his guitar playing. Then Tommy and JY play together at the end and they are perfect. Of course, Tommy and JY are what I love most about this band and they put on an incredible show. What a gift they have! And the guitar playing on Super Star (Tommys solo is the best part of this dvd) and Come Sail Away is amazing. Its to bad someone whistled at the beginning of Come Sail away. Then I thought, this performance is the best these songs have ever sounded! And the HD video is very high quality. And I believe, this BluRay should be the standard which you use to rate stereo and TV systems. It is that good. It should be like Santana Abraxas was for rating stereo systems in the past. I don't know how it would sound in 5.1 though

Then I love it when Tommy says to flip the album over to listen to side two. I love this concept of playing complete albums back to back in the order in which they were recorded. Because this makes side two of the Grand Illusion one of the top albums ever made, in my opinion. It starts with Tommy and Lawrence having fun and then JY takes over for Miss America. He is so talented and his guitar work is always flawless (as is Tommys). Man in the Wilderness is my favorite song and oops, Tommys solo in this song is the best on the dvd. It is a treat to watch JY and Tommy sync together and seeing JYs eyes light up and he smiles because their playing sounds so darn good. That always makes me smile too. This song fades out at the end which is unusual because they normally wind up a song by free styling their instruments and this is where Todd stands out. With his hands and feet moving in all directions at great speed, I don't know how he keeps everything so together. He is a side show in himself (no offence) and is a great reason to buy a ticket to see STYX play in person. I think he is one of the best drummers in the world. I can't wait to see them live in November. Castle Walls is played to perfection and at the middle of the song when Lawrence and Todd and the background video all synchronize, it gives me tingles. Then they stop. Rickys bass starts (and let me say Ricky plays bass perfectly in this dvd also). Then Tommy and JY play beautifully together for a bit and then JY takes over and plays an amazing solo. The song finishes with beautiful harmonies. There is a nice bass lead into the Grand Illusion closing and another JY/ Tommy syncing together (smile) and finishing of the album in Grand form. As the guys walk off stage, you can hear a woman yell that was perfect! and I agree. I give this dvd a ten out of five!!

4984666,5,B006EMSO74,I was born in 1968 so when I was 10 or 11 or whatever I was sneaking into my big brother's record and 8 track collection. Led Zep Van Hallen AC/DC Journey you know all the usual...but Styx always captivated me. When i first saw this performance on sat tv I was taken back so hard. I felt those feelings again in my stomach you know when you feel in love in 6th or 7th grade. I have a lot of concert dvds/blurays. This one conjures feelings that don't compare to any other. If I could be any rock star it would be a cross between Tommy Shaw and James Hetfield. :) This is one of those concerts that I HAD to own.,1442016000,5,611,3.975609756097561

4984673,5,B006EMSO74,"Wonderful albums. Don't listen to the Dennis  DeYoung fans. Cowan has his own unique voice that, in my opinion, fits much better with the rock style of Styx. Ricky Phillips is gifted on the bass and does good vocal backup. DeYoung left Styx, not visa versa. Every other living original Styx member supports the group, and Chuck Pinazzo often performs with the group. I find DeYoung' s voice a bit sappy, personally.. In his lone performances, you only hear his voice. You can't hear the other components of the music. With Styx, you hear it all. Smooth.......",1430265600,3,559,4.762886597938144
4984674,2,B006EMSO74,"So, here we have the Tommy and JY show once again passing themselves off as Styx, when in fact neither one are founding members when Chuck Panazzo isn't making hiis obligatory cameo; But what we do get is a pseudo-live pesentation to about 1200 ignorant fans of two albums that once meant something to music fans. It's very revealing too, as the revisionist re-telling continues in the altered visuals playing behind the band, which includes people that not only suck at replicating the original parts, but at the behest of Tommy Shaw and the prime scumbag of them all, James Young, imposing these charlatans on the revised album covers! One thing Styx never did right up to Deyoung's unforgivable termination is use ""backing,"" or ""sequenced"" vocal patches to cover the limitations of playing live. Scumbag JY, obviously still paying off all the extensive dental work at 66, remarks that some songs they couldn't replicate onstage all those years ago is now possible. No, they're not fine wine...it's called technology. Live sampling can fool everyone that isn't privy to live sound engineering, but make no mistake....Ricky Phillips and the horrible Lawrence Gowan's s***ty vocals can't even polish a turd. It goes a long way to explaining why this collection of misfits tour incessantly, as they are not a functioning band honoring the true Styx, because if they did, Deyoung would be back, or they should just retire. Loads of post-production work was done to make this relesable, but what is the point? Gowan is a fine keyboard player, but his nasal, whinning voice on classic the Dennis wrote and made memorable have been castrated and butchered. Tommy Shaw and James Young were both hired by Dennis Deyoung, and although he is often villified, along with his wife as being a control freak, he started the band, wrote and sang most of the hits....and produced these albums. Does Tommy and JY really believe what they do is authentic Styx? SAD",1429142400,5,1947,4.939024390243903

I think Styx is one of our great American Rock band and I wish Dennis De Young was still in the band.  He wrote some great songs and he's a wonderful entertainer.  When they came out with the Return to Paradise DVD I was stoked!  That being said, this DVD on it's own merits with the new guys, is awesome.  Lawrence Gowan has a great voice and can hit those notes De Young did so well.  He's being respectful of the music and the lyrics that De Young wrote as far as I can tell.  Tommy Shaw sounds as good as ever and while watching the show I wished I was there.  They were very true to the songs we all grew up with and is sounds wonderful.

4984701,5,B006EMSO74,"1977  1978.  I spent many hours listening to The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight albums along with The Eagles, Aerosmith, and Van Halen, back when these guys were all top 40 on the radio.

2014.  Fast forward thirty six years.  So Im in the channel store on my Roku and a new channel called Qello Concerts appears and they have a free 7 day trial. So, I check it out. One of the first concerts I tried was a Paul McCartney concert, cant go wrong there and then, the Styx live concert, Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight.

Ill set the scene. It is 3:45 am, Im lying in bed with my headphones tightly in my ears and turn the volume up. The very first part of the concert was a Star Wars type of intro, explaining where this concert was coming from. The sound from this presentation was not very good so I thought to myself, This aint gonna be good!

Then the guys start playing The Grand Illusion.  The sound suddenly blows out of the phones. I have to crank it up more. I close my eyes and my head sinks back into the pillow. There are many subtle differences, but all are an improvement of what I remember the Styx sound to be.  The singer now has an accent, cant be Dennis? I open my eyes and for the next couple of hours I am in a trance. I love this new band called STYX!

All these guys are not just the best musicians Ive ever seen as a group, but just plain good showmen. In this concert all are really enjoying the experience and each other. They are choreographed by years of on the road performing. The dual guitars of Tommy Shaw and James Young (J.Y.) have chemistry together that Ive never seen before, with the exception of perhaps the Eagles guitarists.  Oh, Ive heard it before in studio albums by Boston and others, but this is live no double tracking or going over everything a dozen takes.

Okay, now, about Dennis DeYoungs replacement, Lawrence Gowan. If you check out some of the recent concert videos (many are on the net) by DeYoung, there is no comparison. Hes nothing more than a lounge singer now.  You cant compare 1977 DeYoung to the current Styx keys, Gowan. Larry flies over DeYoung like superman over the tallest building. I am a keyboard/guitarist and I don't know how Larry does it! What a showman! He plays the keyboard behind his back, he plays from behind and over the keyboard, his keyboard is constantly rotating and he never misses a single note! I understand that some people don't like or tolerate change, but in my opinion this was a fantastic find for this band. In my opinion (I have to keep saying that), Larrys singing, note for note, tops DeYoung. Again, just my opinion, I don't particularly like the deep tremolo Broadway style of singing that DeYoung has these days.

The drummer, Todd Sucherman, works his a** off every minute of this concert. His timing is dead on, the rolls and cymbal play are perfect. And, just as importantly, the technical crew got the mix right on the drums.

Ricky Phillips, the current bass player, is excellent as a bassist and fits right in with the Styx vocals. It was an added touch when they brought back the founding bass player, Chuck Panozzo, for a few of the songs. Just one slight criticism on the technical end of it, the bass guitar is a little light on the Roku Qello version.  Im going to order the BluRay version from Amazon, I hear that the bass is enhanced on that disc.

My favorite song in the concert was Tommy Shaws Man in the Wilderness. He explained (during the concert) that he wrote that song while Styx was touring with the band Kansas. And, that song really does have the Kansas flavor. If youve got Roku, definitely check out Qello Concerts. They don't have Aerosmith, Van Halen, or the Eagles yet but, they do have many other artists worth checking out.

One other reviewer that writes for a guitar magazine stated that the individual members in a band do not really matter, its the compilation. I know by personal experience that that is ALL that matters in a band! Each member works with each other member and basically bond with each other, or not. If it doesnt work, the music is bad and the band will dissolve pretty quickly!",1412553600,3,4135,4.432717678100264

You won't hear Babe or The Best Of Times or Mr. Roboto.  However, it's a flawless performance and superior progressive musicianship.  A guest appearance is made by the original bass player and the vocal harmonies are spot on.  Nothing is transposed and it sounds just as great as 1978.",1409097600,5,408,4.71830985915493
4984704,5,B006EMSO74,"This Blu-ray gives the viewer an idea of the excitement of a Styx show. As with any band that replaces a key member, there are always naysayers that say that it is not the same band. As far as Lawrence Gowan goes, he does an excellent job of reproducing the keys and vocals of the original albums.
I recently had the good fortune of getting to see Styx live, and while it was a completely different show, having this Blu-ray concert is a fine memento of the experience.
The bonus features are interesting as well. It features all the behind the scenes goings on of everyone from guitar techs, merchandisers, sound, etc. The content is interesting for musicians as well as for people who may be simply curious as to the hard work it takes to put on a show like this.

4984715,5,B006EMSO74,"During 1977, Styx wrote what most think is their most stunning material on an album called 'The Grand Illusion'. Then in 1978, they followed that wonder with what most fans feel is yet another stunning album called 'Pieces Of Eight'. Now picture Styx at their absolute best live performance ever to date performing both albums straight through as originally recorded on both albums oddly including even the side changes of the records.  Even back then, they thought many of these songs far, far too difficult to perform live and NEVER attempted to. Yet here we are today....they did it absolutely perfect. Most of these live versions here are recorded far better than the studio originals. Tommy Shaw is amazing in this show stunning me most of all with his apparent agelessness, he's lost nothing to age neither in voice or guitar. If you even LIKE Styx, YOU MUST OWN THIS BLU_RAY! The 5.1 DTS and HI-DEF widescreen presentation of this concert has to be seen to be believed.

This is something Styx can be very proud of.  I have now come to accept their singer replacement.  This band has re-invented themselves.  Such great musicians and entertainers. Really not in to all of this new metal stuff. Listen to these lyrics. They have meaning. I love the way styx songs build and then explode with heavy rock tone. funny,  used to play come sail away and wait until the big guitar solo, then crank the stereo to max and hope the bass didn't make the record skip due to vibration.

4984726,4,B006EMSO74,"Right off the start, if you hold any kind of animosity over the split of Dennis DeYoung from the group, this is not a release for you. Your opinion of how that all transpired and has been dealt with since the breakup and any allegiance to DeYoung is going to cloud your judgement of this. Quite honestly, all you have to do is look to the 1-star ratings to see persons who fell into the group I am referring to. So save your money and frustration.

Member allegiances and drama aside, if all you are interested in is the presentation of the concert, both visually and sound, this is definitely worth your money and time.

Technically, the quality of the image is fantastic. The usual rock video quick cuts are there, but we also get plenty of holds on the players so you don't feel the quick cut whiplash effect. The sound quality also does not disappoint, the balance of instruments and vocals is flawless. All in all, from a technical aspect, all thumbs up.

Musicianship wise, nothing to complain about. Todd Sucherman's drumming is, as it has been, spot on. Newest member Ricky Philips on bass and backing vocals, steps in for Chuck without any complaints (Chuck comes in and out on certain songs to play bass and is a welcomed sight to see him there).

The principle vocalists; Tommy Shaw, JY and Lawrence Gowan, are all in fine form here. Shaw hasn't lost any range that I can tell. He is still able to hit the high range that he is known for. JY, more of the traditional ""rock"" vocalist of the group still can belt it out. Gowan's vocal range and ""sound"" are close enough to Dennis DeYoung that the songs do not suffer from sounding that much different from the originals. There is no mistaking the differences in Gowan's vocals from DeYoung's, but solely judged on his own merit, Gowan is more than able to handle the songs that DeYoung originally sung lead vocals on.

Shaw and JY's guitar playing are on par with their early glory days, no loss of skill in that department. Gowan is a more than capable keyboard player, he does a great job of playing the well known intros, melodies and solos as they were recorded originally with bits of his own flourishes thrown in.

My one and only complaint with Gowan is a very superficial one. He has a keyboard which is able to turn 360 degrees. He tends to spend long periods of time with his back to the audience. I understand why he mostly does this; he is able to see the faces of his other band mates during jam segments of songs. But it is also an unspoken breach of entertaining live to have your back to the center audience for any extended period of time. As I said, this is a very nit picky complaint, Gowan is a wonderful showman and his energy level helps to feed the rest of the band. This is just a personal critique of mine.

As I mentioned, this is a release which is squarely intended for the fans who are not caught up in the drama and the soap opera elements of the personnel conflicts behind the scenes. Based entirely on the talent and entertainment presented, this is a highly entertaining release that I recommend.",1392681600,2,3088,4.4548672566371685
4984727,5,B006EMSO74,"I liked Styx back in the day and had a few of their albums, so I decided to give this DVD a shot.  It exceeded my expectations.  The music still sounds great, and the band brings it to life really well.  A few things that jumped out at me:

- The level of musicianship is very high.  In particular, Lawrence Gowan nails the keyboard parts, James Young spits fire with the guitar, and Tommy Shaw isn't too shabby either.  I like the drumming as well, but wasn't happy with the drum sound - too distant and dull.  The bass is fine, you don't really notice it much, and I suppose that's the way it's meant to be with this music.

- I was apprehensive about getting a DVD with someone replacing Dennis DeYoung, but I have to say that Lawrence Gowan nails it.  In addition to his excellent keyboard work, he's a great singer with a tone not too far off DD, and he's a great showman too.

Very enjoyable overall, recommended to any Styx fan.",1391990400,,935,4.261363636363637

4984729,5,B006EMSO74,"Styx is my favorite 70's-on-up band ahead of Journey, Boston, Uriah Heep and several others. I have seen them in concert ten or more times over 30 years. Played on a BIG SCREEN T.V. with a good home theatre sound system, it is like you are there, only more comfortable.",1389312000,,269,4.4
4984730,5,B006EMSO74,"Concert was well performed and captured beautifully.  Sound is fantastic!

Any group will evolve, and in my opinion, DeYoung is not missed in this performance... it allows the band to ROCK without him, and the electricity is obvious in this concert.  Too bad he wanted to sell out the rock vision and try to force them into Top 40 / theatrical, but I'm glad that the others wouldn't have it.  They survive very well without him, and continue to thrive with the extreme talent of Lawrence Gowin on keys and vocals.  Chuck Panozzo's appearances show everyone that THIS is the direction he and his brother John wanted the band to go!  And I have no doubt that John is smiling down on Todd Sucherman's renditions with pride!  He is one of the greatest drummers of all time, and worthy of the awards he's received!

This is the next best thing to seeing STYX live!  And even if you have, you won't be disappointed with this outstanding Blu-Ray. In fact, this is a great compliment to a live show.  I like the concert DVD with the Contemporary Youth Orchestra, but THIS is STYX in their full glory.

They are tight, on the money, and perform to entertain their fans!  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame needs to wake up and induct this band.",1389052800,,1231,4.4708520179372195

This is a great concert.  I watched it beginning to end twice!

The only criticism I can muster is that they play the first 5 songs (Grand Illusion to Ms. America) with even more passion than the rest of the show.  Too bad they could not keep it up all night (giggedy).  Also, I wished they had not shown the crowd so much.  They seem a bit too sedate.  If I had been in the front row I would have been dancing and screaming the whole time!!!",1386979200,,546,3.990740740740741

Gowen is fine,....of coarse Id like to hear Dennis but I rather not see his theatrics. Phillips substantial. The sound quality of this DVD , very good.

4984738,4,B006EMSO74,"My favorite Styx member has always been Dennis DeYoung (Paradise Theater FTW). I've always heard that Tommy Shaw was a true show man, but I've never seen Styx live until now, and I see that it's true.
The other Styx superstar James Young was highlighted with his song Miss America, and performed well with tons of emotion. Back to Tommy. Tommy Shaw sung Man In The Wilderness and I had to just hit the rewind button like 10 times. Definitely, the best performance on this Blu Ray.

Grand Illusion is an excellent album, but Pieces of Eight for me was just okay, and you always heard Blue Collar Man and Renegade on the radio anyway. Grand Illusion is more like a storybook. Of course, you know what your purchasing when you buy this and Dennis isn't there, but Tommy and James made me forget a little bit, just a little bit. For the most part though, I feel the new Styx member did an awesome job with Castle Walls and other songs in general. I've seen other videos of the newest Styx member when he sounded atrocious, but he's come a long way. It is what it is. Very good performance overall.",1381449600,3,1093,4.410891089108911

4984744,5,B006EMSO74,"For all the  negative reviews about this DVD, most are whining about Dennis not being there and this isn't STYX. Well , True Dennis aint there however,,,,,Ive seen STYX in this line up Live 4 times and lets see, John Panozzo DIED and Todd Sucherman joined as drummer in 1996 as an official member with Dennis still a member, Chuck Panozzo is Semi-Retired, however, Chuck P. is still technically in the Band and have seen him Live on stage with TS and JY, so really yes This IS STYX, just without Dennis. Ricky Phillips fills in for Chuck most of the time and I don't hear people complaining about that? The music, audio quality and performance are excellent and kudos to Lawrence Gowan he may not be Dennis but he is an excellent keyboardist, can sing well and puts a lot of effort into what he is doing. True no Dennis, but this is STYX and the DVD just compliments your music collection, get Return to Paradise DVD see some Dennis and Get this one, you won't be disappointed, I promise. The interesting thing I did notice about this concert is the band must have asked the audience to hold back so the recording would be better and it is, because each of the 4 times Ive seen them live the audience loves the songs so much it usually overpowers the sound system.",1378080000,,1264,4.424892703862661
4984745,5,B006EMSO74,"...so my review may not be subjective.  Loved the full album concept, it let you hear some songs live that they have never done in concert before.  While I am a big Dennis DeYoung fan, I like the current line-up as well.  Lawrence Gowan puts his own stamp on the music while still staying true to the song.  The video quality (Blu-ray) is exceptional.",1377734400,,351,4.4375
4984746,5,B006EMSO74,"This is the current lineup as they tour today playing two of their biggest albums, in the order they appear on the albums.  It's really cool to sit back and watch. I love the video that goes with it, and the crowd's cheers as the actor rifles through the stack of vinyl looking for the Styx albums.

I know there are many reviews that score it low because Dennis DeYoung is not part of this lineup, but, let's be clear. John Panozzo is gone and can't be part of the band. Chuck is sick and can only muster a few songs per show. You can't have the ""real"" Styx. The band as it stands does a very credible job of reproducing the sound of the original band. Yeah, Dennis wants back, and yeah, he was the song writer that did most of their hits. But, there were issues between Dennis, Tommy & JY. This is what we get to see, and I for one, along with my wife, both of whom grew through our teens listening to Styx loved this lineup in concert.

But after a few seconds, it became clear you simply got someone to mimic Dennis' voice. It's eerily close, but close in a way like Arnel Pineda is close to Steve Perry. I realize Styx has had internal issues & not all personalities work out in a collaboration. When Styx broke away from Dennis, I thought the main reasons were creative differences (as well as personality ones) and that Styx was wanting to go hard rocking and get away from the more theatrical direction Dennis wanted to pursue. But, here we are in 2013 and we have Grand Illusion/Pieces of Eight which have Dennis' ghost appearing in every single song. It's strange. It's surprising that as businessmen, Styx wouldn't swallow their internal bickering and regroup with Dennis and make even more money. Since cutting Dennis loose, where are all the hard rocking non-Dennis songs Styx promised? C'mon guys, swallow your pride, regroup, and give us the Styx we knew and work together to create some new music.",1373587200,2,1086,4.69109947643979

4984778,4,B006EMSO74,"The product / disc itself is five star.  Excellent picture and sound.

The show itself causes a minimal one star deduction.
Some of the production on the video screen behind the band is awful.  To give one specific: During the song ""Lord of the Rings"" the screen is displaying some sort of circus montage.  If the song were related to scary clowns this would make sense.  Even allowing for concerns over copyright, etc., there must be a thousand other better choices.  Anyway, much of what's going on behind the band during the show is somewhere between distracting and stupid.
One more reason for the one star deduction: I will never understand what the value of the spinning - play behind my back - keyboard is.  It only makes me miss Dennis more.  ""Lawrence"" is an excellent musician - but hard to watch.  Dennis can never be forgotten, but if ""Lawrence"" would show some integrity, many people would not think so much about the missing Dennis.
And Todd... wow.  Todd's a brilliant drummer and manages to give you Panozzo where it's needed while still putting his own stamp on the performance.
Ricky Phillips is outstanding on bass and a solid Styx man.
JY still amazes on guitar.
Tommy Shaw has not only maintained his art, he's exceeded it.  Tommy is better than ever.  The precision and clarity of his vocals amaze me.  If I could, I'd thank him personally for the version of Man in the Wilderness found on this blu-ray.  It's the best since hearing the album for the first time.
So, all things considered, if you're a Styx fan - buy this immediately.  If you're not a Styx fan, buy it anyway.  Some people won't get all of the 'album cuts' but there's enough good stuff for any rock fan to enjoy!",1362355200,,1702,4.567656765676568
4984779,5,B006EMSO74,"With this wonderful concert the Styx's legend comes to live again. An extraordinary high powered reloaded concert where original members as Tommy Shaw, James (J.Y.) Young and Chuck Panozzo explodes the escenary, helped by their esoteric musical chemistry and the endless support of his friends Lawrence Gowan Ricky Phillips and drummer Todd Sucherman that take the audience experience to another level with all the design of the screen animations on every track of the albums ""The grand Illusion"" and ""Pieces Of Eight"" with flawless accuracy. There is another high point that is a must to mention because it helped the music: The sound of the drums are more deep and resonant like in the way of Seventies decade, as well as all the drum licks or little sound details of John Panozzo's playing... The same thing happened with keyboards and bass so the kind of medieval magic is still there... although it's inevitable to think that maybe, it would have been better that Dennis Deyoung had stay there partying with his old and long time friends (no matter what had happened before...).

I had the opportunity to stay at the Dennis DeYoung and Styx concerts here in Mexico, and take part in a little chat with Tommy, Chuck and J.Y. after the Styx concert here... They are still the best for me, and no matter what happened, they will live forever in my heart the same as when I was just a kid looking for a guiding light in this life. THANKS!!!...

4984788,5,B006EMSO74,"For those of you lamenting this is ""not STYX"" I have a bit of a reminder for you. There were THREE songwriters during Styx's heydey: Tommy, Dennis, and JY. Most of the songs were written collaboratively. STYX was NOT DDY's band, nor was he necessarily the most talented of the bunch. This current STYX lineup features 2/3 of that songwriting powerhouse we all love. DDY is an amazing talent, but does not eclipse Tommy or JY in any way. In fact, his personality flaws finally tore the three apart. He made the mistake of thinking he WAS STYX, and based on some of the reviews on here, it seems like he convinced a few of you, too. Now, on to the DVD. This is without a doubt one of STYX's finest concerts that I have ever seen. The sound is superb, musicians are all in top form performing some of the best rock music the 70's had to offer.

Highlights are the 4-part harmony on Great White Hope, Tommy singing Man In The Wildeness, Superstars, and QOS.

Now buy this DVD.....seriously....now.",1360368000,2,993,4.480662983425415

I realize that many people have criticized this due to Dennis De Young not being in the band and since it isn't the original Styx..With that said i will say this (or actually write) that i feel that although Dennis did contribute to the band that he was also detrimental to them in some of his choices for the band,Kilroy was here is a prime example of that. I also saw behind the music with Styx and can understand the position of Tommy Shaw & James Young on how they wanted the bands music to go in a different direction than it was going in with Dennis in the band,that said i think that this was an incredible concert although i felt that the audience was rather lethargic which is no reflection on the performance of Styx,i have also read reviewers complain about how they are simply cashing in on old material however the way i see it is if they are enjoying what they are doing and the people spending money to go to their shows are as well whats the problem?...Some of you people should stop being haters, just because all of the original members are no longer in Styx doesn't mean that they are unable to perform great music or have excellent concerts such as this one.",1360108800,,1338,4.313492063492063

I never really enjoyed the songs featuring James Young but they do those songs justice in this rendition.

I'm no historian, purist, or archival scientist of Styx, their members, former members, or anything like that - having said that, there seem to be 2 types of 'fans' - those like myself that enjoy them for the music and what they brought to the masses for entertainment, style, and influence - and the angry, upset group that nit-picks and criticizes everything but the audience at the concert.
The question is - were viewers entertained? And if so, were they entertained enough to enjoy the show and not analyze it to death. If one spends most of the time critiquing, then why bother?
If one truly enjoys the music, it shouldn't really matter who plays and how well or not it's performed.
The sound was amazing, the music was great, and the visuals were clean and spot on. The 2 albums played back to back, in order, made for great theater.
In short, it was a Styx concert, and if you're a fan, casual or otherwise, then this DVD will be a good addition....",1359417600,5,1103,4.438423645320197
4984795,2,B006EMSO74,"I waited a long time to purchase this product- knowing that DDY was absent. Eventually, I decided that I was ""feeling Tommy"" at the moment and wanted to see Gowan for myself.

I like the concept. Rather than getting a couple of songs off 6 or 8 albums, you get 2 complete albums. It gives you the few hits on those albums plus 16 or so songs that are rarely if ever are done live. In the end, this is pretty much the only reason I can recommend buying this product. It's a fill in DVD for when I want something a little different from Return to Paradise.

Tommy and JY were solid but not spectacular. The drummer was excellent; I like him a lot. The bassist was ""just a guy"" same as the old one. So no loss there. But the DDY songs were not good. Gowan is a major downgrade.

Some people have pointed to all the dorky histrionics that DDY does when he isn't ""the guy"". And yea, they are dorky. And Gowan does his dorky histrionics too. Just different ones. The fact is that in some parts of the songs there isn't anything for the keyboardist to do.

In terms of energy, overall song selection, song quality this DVD pales in comparision to Return to Paradise. If you only buy one Styx DVD, buy that one.",1359331200,2,1203,4.217391304347826

(ok, we've seen that, but that IS excusable -- and it ain't nearly as good). That is how important Dennis DeYoung is to the history, success and sound of Styx.

But that is precisely the Styx we are sold here.  Don't get me wrong; I am also a fan of JY and TS.  They are talented in their own right.  But for them to shrug off the real substance of that group because they legally can, does not excuse their childish entitlement to the Styx name that DDY was most responsible for making.  I've been to a DDY show within the last month and he sounds as good as he did in the 70s.  Stunning.  His vocal talent is on par with the greatest singers in rock history.  I've also been to a TS/JY ""styx"" show live.  It was a good show.  But the big piece was missing, even as good as the stand in is.  C'mon guys, stop being ingrates to the real Styx fans and the man who made your comfy lives possible.  Get back to where you once belonged.

That said, the sound and production on this are good.  But honestly, the big problem here, this is NOT Styx.  And we all know it.

Please kiss and make up.  DDY has taken the high road publicly and stated he's open to regrouping.  So the kids holding the ball have yet to learn to play nice.  Sad.  You all still sound good and can rock it.  Not much time left for grudges before it's too late.",1354060800,20,1446,4.155797101449275

4984805,1,B006EMSO74,"I've seen the DVD and one of the spin off, similar shows from this tour at the small Houston Arena Theater. The 2 albums are not represented properly without the primary songwriter and better voice. The fact that original golden voice is not present makes this a one star effort. This is just another cash in, half baked effort from Tommy and JY. There is a major problem with not including Dennis on this project 1. He wrote the majority of the songs on both albums-more than Tommy, more than JY. 2. His voice suits the songs better-more range, strength. His writing, direction, production, voice and talent are 2nd to none in the Styx camp. Sure Tommy and JY have moments, Dennis just had more.

General complaints about current Styx and fans:
Current Styx ""fans"" common argument ""Styx still plays big venues without DDY.""
The truth: Styx plays big venues with support of at least 2 other big bands from the era (not small time opening bands) to draw ticket sales. And many people buying tickets think DDY is still in the band + they play several of his songs.
It would kill ticket sales if everyone buying a ticket solely for Styx were told DDY is not in the band, the band will not play any DDY songs as they've moved on and are no longer held back from being a true rock band.
Many in the crowd do not keep up with band websites and are to this day shocked when DDY is not there. And for all you idiots that will reply ""They didn't know DDY was not in the band, where have they been, under a rock?"" News flash: Most people at concerts and in that demographic do not care to read up on the internet or think to check the band member facts. It's not exactly important headline news. People hear Styx is coming to town and decide to see them. It is expected the primary songwriter and best singer they've known on the biggest hit songs will be there.

I like most of the bands they tour with, enjoy Tommy and JY songs/singing but do not respect them, the same way one can be entertained by a movie but disrespect the actor's lifestyle. However at this point I will not see them unless there's another must see band on the bill and if Styx is on last, then will leave as the 4-5 Tommy/JY songs aren't worth the pain of hearing butchered DDY songs or lack of show's flow without the original ringmaster.

Tommy, JY: You want Dennis out of the band cause he does too many slower songs and you guys just want to rock.
OK guys, where's all this bottled up scorching hard rock music Dennis stopped you from making? You couldn't write anything good for Kilroy Was Here because of Dennis, or was it due to the heavy drug use? When will this rocking stuff be released? Cyclorama (Alan Parsons called and wants his album cover idea back)? Said album is substandard to garbage level and half of it is an insult to Dennis DeYoung; immediate discount bin. So you guys get creative control, want to break free of Dennis and come out with an album that's more of an insulting tribute to him? You call that moving on? DDY releases an orchestra concert DVD, does broadway music production, the very things you guys ridicule him for, and guess what? You release an orchestra concert (nowhere near as good) and do Improv on Ice, come on guys? You can't stand DDY, want to move on from his legacy but still play his songs + make money off his creation? That's about the equivalent of feeling good about one's self for taking a woman out to a nice restaurant, night on the town while using the ex-husbands credit card to fund it, all the while bashing the man.
JY, you put down DDY's love songs yet the juvenile, crap lyrics for Miss America is great stuff?
Tommy: ""She Cares"", your solo stuff, really? Rivals even JY's corny lyrics and more sappy than DDY. DDY suggested you turn Renegade into a heavy rock song...hmm. Without his creative input you guys would both be nothing.
You can't stand Mr. Roboto, so I assume due to your high standards and virtue you guys have waived all earnings for the DDY songs in commercials, concerts? Guess what? The majority clearly have bought the Styx product because of Dennis. Surely deep down both of you guys know the first 2 minutes of Come Sail Away eclipses everything you've come up with? Does it bother you that Dennis DeYoung The Music of Styx tour would outsell Tommy Shaw The Music of Styx, or even worse JY The Music of Styx?
DDY has the heart, soul, creativity, you both have the Styx banner to wave and legacy to coast on.
So you tour now more without Dennis? Is it maybe because you don't create anything new as band, ride the Dennis wave of hits and at this point don't have to learn or rehearse anything while with Dennis you were creating worthwhile songs and recording a new album almost every year?
You release a DVD with REO Speedwagon, play Blue Collar Man 2x, the 2nd time with REO, yet no difference in arrangement, silly. DDY would never allow such a goofy thing to be done at a show.
Have you heard DDY 100 Years From Now? Thoughts? Think you guys can beat that content? You can't, it's the best Styx album since Paradise Theater.
I would love to see you guys bring Dennis and his band on tour to open, full show, lights, sound and see how he would wipe the floor with you guys.",1353024000,17,5223,4.404761904761905

They perform songs from 2 of their classic albums, song by song, taken right from the albums. The albums are ""The Grand Illusion"" & ""Pieces of Eight"". If you like Styx or Classic Rock, then you'll love this special dvd. Thanks!!!!!

P.S. I got to see this exact line-up of Styx in Concert on their 2012 Tour, in Bossier City, Louisiana on November 10, 2012, and let me tell you THEY WERE FANTASTIC!!!!! AND SO IS THIS CONCERT DVD, It's the next best thing to being there watching them perform live. Thanks!!!!",1351728000,,712,4.696
4984807,5,B006EMSO74,"So my brother told me of this DVD a few months back, I was like ""No Dennis, No thank you!"". saw real cheap at Best Buy, so I bought a copy. The Grand Illusion is my fav Styx album and Pieces of Eight ranks high up there too, so to have a Live show where they just do those albums, sure why not.
  That Gowen guy does do a decent job, he's no Dennis, but he aint bad either. Plus, him and Todd Sugarman have been in the band now 13 years, how time flies by huh? The 2 replacement guys have spent more time in Styx then DDY did!
The DVD is filmed beautifully! Good clean crisp film of the show. The 5.1 sound mix is ok, seems it could have been a better use of speaker separation, but it didn't stink either. The crowd was small and seemed rather quiet, but this isn't Rush or The Who they came to see either, but they seemed a tad reserved, those big stadium days are over, this theater prob housed 8,000 tops, so you get a good intimate night with Styx. Tommy Shaw was superb, his renditions were excellent and he played and sang with a lot of emotion JY did a very good version of ""Miss America"". So I have to highly recommend this DVD! Even if your still mad because they booted out Dennis, I understand your frustration, I'm there with ya, but this is a very good and entertaining DVD, a DVD where they play 2 classic albums from start to finish....enjoy!",1349827200,2,1358,4.120754716981132

I'm so glad that they decided to put this show on DVD to hold on to that memory forever.

Two songs that should have been included here are ""Too Much Time on My Hands"" and ""Crystal Ball"" - two masterpieces penned by Tommy and are amazing in concert! That withstanding, this recording is truly representative of the band as it is currently.

Lawrence Gowen does an awesome job of filling DDY's shoes, but he doesn't quite have that vocal quality that defined many of DDY's songs. Also, although the concept of playing entire albums as a first and second half of a concert is an interesting one, there are two or three songs (particularly in the Pieces of Eight half) that really don't deserve a concert performance and it would have been better to hear more famous, or successful tunes rather than these. But it's still a joy to see Tommy Shaw and JY Young doing their thing- rocking out Styx songs with a passion and they are both very accomplished rock guitarists.

4984827,3,B006EMSO74,"Yes, I remember Styx.  I must have seen them at least 4 times live.  Two times, maybe even unpaid.  I believe I saw them in 1979 at the Michigan State Fair as a free show, simply because I paid for admission to the State Fair itself.

During this era of their successful career, I was already growing tired of them. I think I shared a couple of beers backstage with Tommy Shaw even though I was just there because some girl I was dating wanted to go to the State Fair and get out of the house and just get out and party with some guy who had a remote interest in the Styx ""Equinox"" album.

Anyway, this concert really offers a time capsule that really reflects how long ago 34 years was from today. I can see their point of view of wanting to keep their two classic albums alive to audiences that remember when these two albums were the best selling albums of Styx.

I still prefer ""Equinox"" over these two albums, and I'm glad that they didn't play ""Babe"" or ""Mr. Roboto"" because I'd really like to forget that era of Styx.

My kids wouldn't get into this concert, I don't think.  Maybe a few people my age.  Maybe friends of mine back in Michigan, but certainly no one I know here in California.

I'll watch this Blu-ray disc again, only if a friend of mine stops by and sees it in my collection. I wouldn't watch this one alone again. This is a concert to be shared by someone who equally dwells on the past. So, let's see what happens in the next 30 years or so.

Once I saw the full range of these guys, I was awestruck and had to get my hands on more of their albums and videos. I must clarify by saying that I am in love with this present lineup, NOT with the previous band that included Dennis DeYoung. So, to have the chance to hear a concert of the old 70's albums Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight with my favorite lineup was a dream come true. I was blown away by the sound quality and the stage production. That just added to my rock fantasy. Seeing the songs that were not previously recorded live was an added treat and showed the talent and expertise of this team.

Why bring Chuck Pannazo on for 1 song. Let him go.

Cons: Lawrence Gowan sucks as a replacement for Dennis DeYoung.
While DeYoung's voice soared, Gowan's voice is harsh and he can not hold a tune.  While he tries hard to mimic DeYoung he falls far short. His voice is bothersome and weak.

4984838,5,B006EMSO74,"(I purchased the CD/DVD combo pack first, then picked up a copy of the BR).

In what has to be one of the best conceptualized concerts of the decade, Styx took 2 of their platinum selling albums for a refreshing tour of the US, stopping in Memphis for the filming of this event.  While it may seem unnecessary to state, these recordings come alive, literally alive.

Some might argue that many of these songs are already mainstays of the Styx setlist and that many of them have been captured live in the trove of live CD's and video released by Styx in the last decade, but this format gives them a new life.  It's kinda like taking out your old Styx records and putting them on your turntable, and suddenly the band walks into the room and plays all of the songs.

Of the DVD, I can't imagine that it could have been filmed or recorded any better.  There are plenty of cameras to give the viewer a multitude of views and the sound is presented in DTS, filling the room with that ""right there in the middle of it"" sound.  For a fan, it can't get any better.

Sure, the songs are old and many of them have been part of the setlist for decades, and there are many other live recordings from the band, but this is the only place to get the Side 1> Side 2> next album> Side 1> Side 2 in one convenient package.  For more than 2 hours and 11 minutes Styx fans are treated to the show of a lifetime.

When all is said and done, this package works.  For fans that weren't able to catch this tour, this gives you the perfect opportunity to see the event and enjoy it over and over.  When you consider the price of concert tickets versus the very reasonable price here at Amazon, you'll see that you just can't go wrong with this purchase.",1331251200,,1730,4.240853658536586

Other reviewers have written about the technical quality of the video, music, & stage show, and they're right, it's fantastic. I'm here to tell you, this is Styx the rock band. They didn't screw with what we know & love. No drama and the songs are all close to the original recordings, not rearranged because they're bored with their own music. Nothing ruins live music more than musicians who look unhappy performing. Tommy & JY look like they're having more fun now than 30 years ago. If their tour comes to Boston this summer, I'm there.

Multi triple platinum albums 1977's Grand Illusion and '78 Pieces of Eight  two of the probably the greatest rock albums of all time played live with Styx main core members Tommy Shaw and James 'JY' Young peforming flawlessly. Tommy and JY have been able to hold Styx  leagacy  for over a decade together well, with a very competent line up and despite their well publicised break up with original member Dennis De Young have been able tour and release albums with huge success. Their line up over the years have been consistant with Lawrence Gowan on Vocals and Keys, Ricky Phillip on bass and Tod Sucherman on drums. The concert filmed on November 9th, 2010 at the historic Orpheum Theater in Memphis, TN, culminates the great showmanship,energy and friendship the band has been harnessing over the years.
I lived off these albums in '78-'79 played them 24/07 this was truly a 'Rock Odyssey' they were the 'real' days of hard rock!!!I still have these albums including the limited edition  of pieces of eight.
Orignal founding member Chuck 'chucky' Panazzo as usual makes guest appearences on songs with the heavy base lines like 'fooling yourself' and appears to be very happy with these stints. For years I've been yearning to hear 'Man in the wilderness and tommy nearly brought tears to my eyes so was Lawrence on  Castle Walls, Sing for the day, I'm Ok were executed to perfection, also JY songs Miss America, Lord of the Rings  were performed  to perfection It's  as though you are  listening to them off the original albums. I've always loved the ageless  Tommy's songs in Styx's Crystal Ball, Grand Illusion, Pieces of Eight and Cornerstone he had that 'lulaby voice' and together with JY produced some soaring solos De Young was very Inspirational until in '80 when he tried to'theatrerise' the band and that was the end of Styx...but the  Styx resurgence in  the last era has moved us the harcore fans !!!

For anyone that remembers these 2 albums when they were released, this blu-ray is an absolute must own.  I literally had chills as I cranked some of the deeper tracks:  Man in the Wilderness, Castle Walls, Queen of Spades, & Pieces of Eight.  I never thought I would hear these songs again live, much less in the manner captured here.  I remember and love DDY as much as the next diehard Styx fan, I saw him and Styx in 77 and 78 when they toured on these albums, but Gowan is much more than a capable replacement.  He truly is a talented showman.  Right now, I really don't know if DDY could pull-off a song like QoS the way Gowan can, when Gowan hits the ""and she's THERE!!!!!!!"" note in QoS it truly is something to savor.

The technical merits of this blu-ray are well documented by others, however it's the true transporation in time to a rock music era that no longer exists which I cannot overstate.

4984851,4,B006EMSO74,"Journey sans Steve Perry. Foreigner sans Lou Gramm. And Styx sans Dennis DeYoung. Shadows of their former selves, or a rejuvenated reinvention? Or something else?

Three years ago after taking a hiatus from concerts, I went to see Def Leppard with special guests Styx and Foreigner. Def Lep has pretty much had the same line-up, with the exception of Vivian Campbell. I had no real expectations of Foreigner or Styx. However, I was pleased with their showmanship and decided that they at least deserved that much.

There are a lot of purists out there, some who have posted reviews, and I appreciate their comments as well. They have every right to voice their opinion that Styx with DeYoung just isn't Styx. I agree to a certain extent. But I've seen Styx twice in the past three years and I'd see them again this coming weekend except that I'm working nights. They worked hard to please the audience, and please the audience they did.

My concert T-shirt says ""Classic Rock My Ass!"", a testimonial to the band's constant touring and performing. Who can't appreciate that? Having the label ""Classic Rock"" doesn't imply dinosaur status; in my humble opinion, the label means that the music has and will continue to stand the test of time. And no matter the line-up, I'll continue to see them for as long as they continue to perform.",1329264000,3,1332,4.757575757575758
4984852,5,B006EMSO74,"I've bought LOTS of stuff on Amazon but this Styx concert is the first one that prompted me to write a review so that should tell you something.

I am a big Styx fan and they are one of my favorite bands.  I used to listen to them as a kid in the early 80's and the first cassette I got was 'Caught In the Act' or 'Grand Illusion' (I can't remember which was first).  I've since bought a lot more of their stuff, most of it in the last year.

It seems impossible to comment on the newer material without mentioning the absence of DDY in the band.  I recognize the significance of DDY in the band and will always favor his vocals in the songs he's sung with Styx.  At the same time, from what I've read and seen in the live concert dvds I've watched recently, it's obvious that his musical interests drifted too far from the traditional Styx sound and just didn't fit with the band anymore.  After watching this 'Styx: Grand Illusion / Pieces of Eight - Live' concert, I have finally accepted the fact that he will probably never be in Styx again and I think Gowan is an excellent replacement.  Even though vocally I still favor DDY and his Styx song writing is unequalled, Gowan absolutely distroys him on the keyboards and stage presence.  Gowan just looks like he fits where I hate to say it, but DDY was looking too much like Barry Manilow wannabe stuck in with a rock band (post 70's).

As far as this concert dvd/blu-ray goes, it is easily the BEST overall production of any concert recording I've ever seen and far outshines any other Styx live video previously created.  The video is phenomenal and the sound is even better.  I cannot get over how good the sound is and how well the band plays.  Their music is SO tight and crisp in this recording.  I suppose the camera editing could be a little better with a few less close-ups but it is a minor gripe.  The vocals in the concert are very good overall but not perfect.

Tommy Shaw was spectacular vocally and near perfect I think.  The harmonies were also VERY excellent and I think the best of any live Styx recording.  Individually, JY and Gowan were a little more of a mixed bag.  I think Lawrence actually did a better job than DDY has previously on some songs and shined on 'I'm OK', but was kind of weak on others like 'Come Sail Away'.  JY, as much as I normally love his vocals were a lot more inconsistent in this live recording.  Some moments he was spot on while others were lacking.  Either he is getting to old to nail the songs or was just tired vocally (hopefully tired).  They weren't horrible or even bad, but just not the caliber I was hoping for.

I think all of the band members were brilliant in their instrument playing except for maybe Chuck P. who just obviously isn't in concert shape anymore and in my opinion, added nothing to the experience.

Styx is probably the one band that if I had a time machine, I would have loved to gone back into the 70's and gone to a concert.  I will never forgive myself for blowing off the Return to Paradise tour and even their show last year at Red Rocks in Denver.  I have never seen them live and hope I get one more shot because I will not miss it again.  This live concert is probably as good as being there as it gets.

Unfortunately, the guys are getting up there in age and who knows how long they can and will keep touring.  If you watch their concerts in sequence, you can see that they have slowed down quite a bit on stage physically and that's a real bummer.  Fortunately, they still bring an amazing sound to the show and may be at their best sonically right now (except for lacking DDY vocals).  I would love to see them live even if they just stood there and sang/played.  I agree with others that they need to record new stuff and I did enjoy Cyclorama overall.  That said, who can argue with the awesomeness of them recording their BEST TWO albums in their entirety live?  This has to be the best decision the band has made since doing the Return to Paradise tour back in the 90's and their execution was so excellent that I can give nothing but 5 stars for this product.",1329091200,12,4108,4.29778933680104

4984855,5,B006EMSO74,"Styx: The Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight Live is an eye-popping DVD of the concert of all Styx concerts for the discerning fan.  For those of us who were teens in the seventies, this DVD will bring back many, many very fond memories as the band performs both albums in their entirety.

Performed and recorded in the beautiful and historic Orpheum Theater in Memphis, Tennessee, Styx delivers each and every tune from both albums absolutely note perfect.  What makes this DVD especially unique is that, reportedly, the band never performed three of the songs live prior to this concert. Personal favorites such as Fooling Yourself, Blue Collar Man and Renegade never sounded better.  Hearing them on this DVD instantly transported me back to the late seventies.  What a trip!

As with other bands from the seventies, the current line-up in Styx isn't ""all original"" on this recorded concert but I defy anyone to say that this version isn't as good as it gets.  The musicianship in this line-up is supremely represented in this concert.  Dennis DeYoung is replaced Lawrence Gowan and does a dang good job of it, thank you very much.  The late J.C. Curulewski is replaced on drums by Todd Sucherman who I at first thought was Journey drummer, Deen Castronovo but I soon figured he wasn't. But fans will be quite pleased that J.Y. Young, Tommy Shaw, Chuck Panozzo, and Ricky Phillips (formerly with Bad English and The Babys but with Styx  for the past nine years) are still cranking out the Styx tunes on this DVD.

The albums that this DVD is based on are well known so a review of the songs isn't necessary here. However, as far as concert DVD's are concerned, you won't find a more brilliant DVD both in its quality of sound, visual appeal and production quality and is well worth the watch even if one isn't a Styx fan.

Some thirty years ago I was into all the progressive rock bands, and I was trying to like Styx because their songs on Crystal Ball were so good, except for the annoying vocal timbre of their lead singer Dennis DeYoung. Grand Illusion changed that, and, thanks to Tommy Shaw, Styx became one of my favorite bands. This line-up is terrific. I can't believe Tommy Shaw still looks and sounds so good. Lawrence Gowan is incredible. Todd Sucherman? One of the best drummers in the world! Of course we're all happy Chuck Panozzo made it through the HIV thing, but Ricky Phillips is a REAL bass player.

4984858,4,B006EMSO74,"I read a lot of the reviews of this dvd, but must say I don't know what all the hoopla is about. Is styx after money? Yes- like it or not, rock music is a business. Does it matter? No. I watched this dvd back to back with Return to Paradise. Both are good, but neither is really superior to the other. The guy taking DDY place does not sing as well, but isn't as dramatic (a plus in my mind). The music is great. Tommy Shaw's energy and guitar playing, not to mention his seemingly unchanged voice, carry the whole show. I don't care much for JYs gutteral singing, but to re-create PoE, I suppose it was necessary. Other than that, this is a great set for only 15 bucks. It is worth the ticket price for Man in the Wilderness and Castle Walls alone (tho there are many other highlights). If you are a Styx purist, avoid it (but don't whine about it's existence either). If you just like good music performed well... its not perfect, but I'm glad I bought it.",1328832000,10,958,4.211956521739131
4984859,5,B006EMSO74,"I saw original live shows in the 70s with the original members. The real truth here is that the original band didn't put out a DVD of these two albums live so I am GRATEFUL for the efforts of the current band to celebrate their love of all that is STYX. I just saw Styx in concert last week in the Seattle area and they ARE NOT a bunch of hired musicians imitating Styx. They are great musicians who honor the past by performing it even better than the past band did....no kidding...the energy on stage is BETTER than ever! That's quite something for musicians who are not young in any way. It can be argued that the singing talent of the individuals or the band in total doesn't better the past but it is truly a shame that people can't just appreciate it for what it is and resist the tempatation to compare. Why not be just honestly grateful for a band that does Styx songs SO close to the originals....I refuse to understand the haters. I saw their Improv on Ice accompaniment of the ice skaters as they improvised their ice skating routines. Another honor!! The haters are so busy crying that Dennis De Young isn't part of the band that they CAN""T SEE that the music is so awesome and artistic in its musicality....to be chosen to accompany ice skaters is such a great honor for the band that I love. I saw Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" live with Roger Waters last year and I didn't hear ONE person complaining that it wasn't the ""original band."" We were there to see a SHOW and what a SHOW it was. Styx should be just as honored as part of the very few bands still performing from the era they began. Haters, go away.",1328832000,7,1617,4.304918032786885

I've seen them in concert a large number of times and they just keep getting better every year. Yes, there have been changes in the line up (but there's a lot of bands out there with those same changes) but as much as I'm a huge Dennis DeYoung fan, I love this current line up. They put on an incredible show and this concert is no exception. I was lucky enough to see this show in Atlanta, and watching the DVD brought it all back.

4984861,5,B006EMSO74,"Even while I'm not a hardcore/die-hard fan of Styx, let's face it, I grew up listening among others, to their music as well, so it is not hard at all for me, to grab anything from them from the 70's, and give it an spin. While I saw this video, offering two of the best albums from them together, in their entirety, and IMO two of the best albums from that time as well, I couldn't resist the temptation of getting it. Guys, I was expecting some kind of maybe good approach to the real sound of that time, given some of the complexity of that work, but no, I was wrong, I was really shocked to see how good this concert was put together, and performed, songs seem to be directly from the album...And for the DDY fans, guys, just face it, he is good, one of the best singers out there nowadays, but he is also responsible for some, if not most of it, of the mediocre material of the 80's of that band as well, his Barry Manilowish performance of the last albums is simply unbearable for me...if you can get it, just jump on it, do not let this one get away...",1328313600,4,1058,4.140776699029126
4984862,5,B006EMSO74,"At age 13, one of the first records I ever bought was Styx's ""Grand Illusion."" When ""Pieces of Eight"" came out, I scrambled to get it. I remember lying on my back, lights out, headphones on, partaking in their sonic magic.

By the time I began attending concerts (probably just a year later) Styx had already ventured off into ""Top 40 Land"" and I lost interest. I've seen the band numerous times since they re-grouped in 1990. And while every show has been great, none have fully matched my initial infatuation.

For me, this DVD is pretty close to ""the Holy Grail."" It's the concert I was imagining in the dark all those years ago.

Anyone familiar with these albums already knows that the set list is nothing less than perfect. In this performance, Styx is musically tight and with a majestic sound, looking healthy and happy. Each musician excels, and the Styx signature harmonies are out in force. Great care has been taken to fine-tune everything, even Styx mainstays (for example, ""Miss America"" gets back her usually-absent instrumental intro).

Tommy Shaw is like some miracle of nature, singing and playing with as much prowess as ever. (""Sing For The Day"" is out of this world!)

Drummer extraordinaire, Todd Sucherman, is exciting like fireworks. I read in an interview that his affection for these albums in his youth made this project a particular labor of love. It shows. And his technical flair adds a magic all its own.

I wasn't expecting it, but some of the best sounding numbers turn out to be ""I'm Okay,"" ""Queen of Spades"" and ""Pieces of Eight,"" all penned and originally sung by Dennis DeYoung. Keyboardist/vocalist Lawence Gowan really nails them. And I'm happy to report, the keyboard ""voices,"" which I understand can be tough to replicate with equipment 30 years after-the-fact, come pretty darn close to the original tones.

The only weakness I notice in the performance is a strain in James Young's voice on a couple of songs (although, not all of them). It must have been a bad night, as he's usually outstanding.

Overall, I don't think the band has ever sounded better. These guys are total pros. And their joy and enthusiasm is infectious.

The video itself is pristine and skillfully edited. You definitely feel up-close and catching special moments. The audio has been masterfully mixed by the band and very-long-time Styx engineer, Gary Loizzo.

Included on the disc is a documentary where members of the Styx crew walk us through the staging and execution of the show. As a hobby guitarist who has spent some time with bands, I found it pretty interesting. My kids did as well.

If you like 1977-78 era Styx, simply put, this DVD ROCKS! For fans that refuse to enjoy Styx sans Dennis DeYoung, (if, for nothing else, the principle of it), this obviously is not going to be their cup of tea. (To each his own.) But for everyone else, I can say without hesitation,

Anyway, I am running a Pioneer Elite SC-27, Klipsch Refrence series 7.1, and Epson Pro Cenima 9700UB. Watching this  disc right after the show was like still being there.

4984868,3,B006EMSO74,"Another live release from a band that looks like they are going to play music forever. Now they have a steady line up, the same as the previous DVD release, with the contemporary youth orchestra of Cleveland. This time, there is no orchestra. The band played their 2 most popular albums of the late 70's : ""The Grand Illusion"" and ""Piece of Eight"", in their entirety.

Shot in high definition with 11 cameras at the Orpheum Theater in Memphis, this DVD offers a nice picture quality and a DTS-HD sound that give you what your looking for when you want surround sound. The stage settings is interesting with a giant back screen and a nice light show as well. On this screen, the band decided to show someone using a turntable to play the music of those 2 albums, like it was LP with side one and two.

As far as the performance goes, there is not much wrong with this band that got a lot of experience over the years, knowing how to make this show a success. The music of Styx while not always interesting in their later days, was better in their earlier days. To take the decision to play the 2 most popular albums, was not a big risk, but i can't say i was pleased with the quality of the songs on both albums, especially with ""Piece of Eight"", who contains some more ordinary songs.

The highlights songs were the well known ""Come Sail Away"" , ""Castle Walls"" for the great instrumental part, and ""Lords of the Ring"" for his symphonic approach. If you like pop music with a symphonic touches, nice vocal harmonies and a nice guitar and keyboard interplay, you will enjoy most of the material here, but for someone who want hear some pure progressive rock music, this is not for you. Myself i am in the middle of both categories, i was a little bit disappointed by some of the songs on ""Piece of Eight"" and would have prefer hear some others songs from the band on others albums, like ""Suite Madame Blue"", but it was not possible here, with the concept of the show.

This is a nice addition for any Styx fans, or those who have enjoyed a lot these two albums. I would have prefer hear and see ""Equinox"" on this show. But for a technological aspect, this show is a real success. If i had to rate this for the quality of sound and picture, it would be 5 stars, but i think the music is more important than the package, so i give 3.4 stars.",1328054400,4,2337,4.316628701594533

Never thought I'd get to see and hear Man in the Wilderness performed live and DeYoung's I'm Ok and Castle Walls should, in my opinion, be included on the set list on a regular basis. As for DeYoung...well...he didn't seem to take rock music seriously after Pieces of Eight. I count just TWO rock tracks from DeYoung on the THREE records that followed Pieces of Eight (Borrowed Time and Rockin the Paradise). When you move too far away from an established sound, as DeYoung did, you deserve what you get. And it's too bad because he IS a great rock singer but insufferable, to my ears, as a balladeer. Note to DeYoung fans... this band didn't become huge because of DeYoung's Barry Manilow-ish ballads. They became a top concert draw because of loud, crunchy rock guitars, progressive rock oriented keyboard flourishes and soaring choruses. And that's mostly what you'll get with this performance - a return to form. I suspect that if DeYoung was still in the band, he wouldn't have agreed to cover these albums. Seems like it was always his way or no way. So no, I don't miss him. I hate Babe, Don't Let it End, Robot and all that crap.

I thought I was going to be disappointed, as the latter two bands did not have their original line-ups... I'm happy to say that that was NOT the case with Styx. STYX STILL ROCKS. In my humble opinion, they are the hardest working band in show business, continuously touring and continuously pleasing the crowds.

No, this review is nothing ground-breaking, just my opinion on one of my long-time favorites. Thank you for the music, Styx, and may you continue to rock house after house! This new DVD will be on my shelf this week.",1327881600,3,756,4.71969696969697

Lawrence Gowan and JY gave excellent performances during their songs, with Lawrence's rendition of ""Queen Of Spades"" being one of the highlights of the show. Todd Sucherman and Ricky Philips are definitely one of the tightest rhythm sections in rock & roll. Todd's fills are just jaw-dropping; he adds a lot of great new dynamics to the classic songs. Ricky plays the bass parts with authority and is also an excellent harmony/background vocalist. Original bass player Chuck Panozzo appeared for a few songs and was rock solid.

My wife and I caught the show at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, four days after the band had videoed and recorded the show at the Orpheum Theatre in Memphis for this release.

From a technical sense, this is a masterpiece---filmed in HD w/ 11 cameras, and the accompanying coordinated video that played on the screen while the band is playing live is visible enough to where you can tell that the video production company nailed their assignment in prepping this for the concert
(definitive example: The screen explodes with a ""Get up!"" graphic when that shout-out line comes along in ""Fooling Yourself"".

Three of the songs had never been performed in concert before, and the band is in fine form. As for perceived controversies about the lineup, the disproportionate live albums, etc., this is the most stable lineup the band has ever had; the newest member is Ricky Phillips, who came on board over 8 years ago. For what my opinion's worth, Gowan has taken the so-called DDY songs and made them his own---he sings in the same range but is a bit grittier, and he is quite animated onstage, never taking himself artsy/seriously.

Here's the point (of this release and my perspective): Every generation wants to hear the music it came of age with for the rest of its collective life. Styx fully acknowledges they're now in the ""classic rock"" band category, and part of that pigeonhole includes playing the hits for folks who are in the same age demographic as most of the band members. This presentation is an enjoyable and professional effort by a band that still knows how to rock hard, and how to entertain their audience.

4984879,4,B006EMSO74,"Curiously, in music there are many people complaining about member switches during the live of a musical group. Such is the case, especially, with Styx (as so many other groups out there). I see a group like a sports team: It can (and will) suffer member changes because there are (or not) empathy, comfort, same direction, interests, share of thoughts, virtuosity, death, and the like. I wonder if all of the people that are in constant complain about this, complains the same with their favourite sports team, and member switches (even, manager, trainer, couch, or the like, switches). All these movements are done with the idea of enhance or better the experience.

The same happens with music groups. It is really the same thing with long-live musical groups, like Kiss, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, Rolling Stones, Magnum, Van Halen, and many others. If a group that I like switches members, I just keep my ear in the new (and existing) materials, and their way to interpret them with the virtuosity of the new member, and that's it. It can be good, better, or worst than the original alignment, but always will be different, without being a different group.

I think that people is tearing their clothes with things like this. This is Styx, and will be Styx. Music is Styx, and result of their job will be Styx. Even, Tommy Shaw is NOT an original member of Styx (such guy was John Curulewsky), but it was still Styx. Sound is under the signature of Styx and I enjoy to hear and see Styx.

For what my opinion's worth, Gowan has taken the so-called DDY songs and made them his own---he sings in the same range but is a bit grittier, and he is quite animated onstage, never taking himself artsy/seriously.

Here's the point (of this release and my perspective): Every generation wants to hear the music it came of age with for the rest of its collective life. Styx fully acknowledges they're now in the ""classic rock"" band category, and part of that pigeonhole includes playing the hits for folks who are in the same age demographic as most of the band members. This presentation is an enjoyable and professional effort by a band that still knows how to rock hard, and how to entertain their audience. A band's personnel lineups are, bottom line, irrelevant if the customer's satisfied, and I thought this show delivered in spades.",1327104000,133,1918,4.771084337349397
4984881,5,B006EMSO74,"I saw Styx half a dozen times back in their day.  I've seen them a couple of times in the past 2 years.  They were great in both era's.  But the fact is Dennis wanted to turn them into a sappy ballad band with Broadway theatrics.  He was great but he's gone, so get over it.  Mr Gowan adequately covers his parts.  He's a very good singer, a good keyboard player, and a special plus... he's a team player.  Sure, any of us would like to see the full original line up, but saying this is a ""tribute"" group to Styx, or that Gowan is a no-talent hack is absurd.  If they hadn't kicked Dennis out there would be no Styx at all.  I saw them this past fall with Yes.  And the people I went with said Styx was one of the best shows they had ever seen.  And all of us there had several decades of concert experience.  Folks, ignore the nay-sayers and enjoy this very vital group who are exciting to watch and still rock hard!  To the nay-sayers, go back to sucking your thumbs and watching your Air Supply DVD's!",1327104000,9,1004,4.11340206185567
4984882,1,B006EMSO74,"Can the ""new-Styx-fans"" imagine if Dennis Deyoung owned the Styx name, FIRED Tommy Shaw and JY, hired 4 new musicians, called the band Styx, then re-recorded Fooling Yourself, Renegade, etc OVER And OVER again with his new singer so that there were more versions of the new singer singing Fooling yourself on Styx albums than Tommy?  Can you imagine if he released something like this with those other musicians?  Can you imagine if he did this with no acknowledgement whatsoever of Tommy or JY other than to say: ""our new Styx guitarist is the best we've ever had and he sings these songs better than our old guitarist""?  It's hard to imagine because I doubt Dennis would ever be so classless.  Yet that is exactly what ""Styx"" is & does with releases like this.  And this is EXACTLY what fans of ""true-Styx"" and Dennis do not like this release (sight un-seen) and the countless others like it.  What if Ricky & Todd gained control of the name, fired Tommy & JY, and released a live DVD of past Styx songs with all new members singing past Styx songs and called the band Styx?  Would we be allowed to comment on that?  Or do we just have to say how wonderful it is that they're still playing music.  I would think Tommy Shaw fans would be all over a release like that (sight un-seen).  Would it then be fair to say to all Tommy Shaw (and Styx) fans that they're living in the past just because it's 5 different guys calling themselves Styx?

I like plenty of bands that have changed personnel.  Not liking a band's new member choice or direction  doesn't make me ""living in the past"" or delusional.  It simple means I don't like their choice(s).  This product is simply lousy, in my opinion (I KNOW it WILL be because it doesn't have Dennis on it :)).  So before you attack me for not likely this simply because Dennis isn't on it you're no different ""attacking the attackers"" and defending the band, and product like this.

It's not about past versus current it's about good versus crap!  And I think this will be crap.  hey- it's just an opinion- and isn't that what reviews are supposed to be?",1327017600,7,2096,4.482849604221636
4984883,5,B006EMSO74,"I have seen these guys soooo many times and as far as I'm concerned, they rock harder than they ever did with Mr. Dennis DeYoung! In my opinion it seems as though he was the one calling all the shots and just loved those slower,sugary ballads (for example Babe.)Not that I disliked them back then but just feel as now they're simply a band that really rocks! If you never saw them live with their current, but same line-up for around 5 yrs. now or more,please don't let the negative reviews make your decision for you. They are awesome in concert and my friend who's 18 and never saw them before (or knew much of them) said they are the best band she'd ever seen before! Rock on everyone",1327017600,8,687,4.333333333333333
4984884,5,B006EMSO74,"I was front row for this show when they performed this tour. They played both albums back to back. They rock! They don't just stand there and play...they PERFORM! They are audience friendly, high energy, musical perfectionists who really try to put on a show for the fans!!! Every member contributes their all. Tommy Shaw & JY are more awesome than ever! Gowan is an awesome keyboardist and does some DDY vocals. Those 3 are the ""showmen"". Todd, the drummer, is so hard working and Ricky Phillips also adds his talent to the guitar mix. Chuck Panozzo brings nostalgia and his rock ability. The sound was just like the original and it is a great chance to see some awesome songs not performed in their regular shows. Well worth every penny. You will watch it again and again.",1326758400,2,774,4.615942028985507

This one does not have Dennis, but is awesome in every way.  In fact, if I could keep only one, this would be the one.  They play Grand Illusion album from start to finish and kill it.  They play pieces of eight songs (never played live before).  This one takes me captures how awesome they are.  I have about 35 killer concert videos from great Rock and Country Bands.

8496885,5,B006EMSO74,"Truly outstanding DVD of Styx's live show shot in hi-def with 11 cameras  playing every song from two of their iconic LP's: Grand Illusion and Pieces of Eight. They've polished their act into a highly enjoyable, dynamic hi-octane show. Not only are each of the players at the top of their game, the added bonus of interviews with the road crew and inside behind the scenes details on how each member's roadie becomes another member of the band in split second backstage choreography in making Styx one of the most spectacular live shows touring today. Though Dennis DeYoung will always be missed, Lawrence Gowan stays true to the original compositions while lending his own unique brand of stage performance to the mix. James Young is as smooth as ever, while drummer Todd Sucherman astounds with his boundless driving drumming. Tommy Shaw is always up to the task rounding out this tight knit ensemble with skill and prowess. Styx has toured tirelessly since DeYoung's departure and they are  stronger than ever, the hundreds of performances have resulted in an act so finely tuned and polished it seems impossible to improve on it. They wisely stick to what they do best - bringing back the timeless treasure of their 70's recordings. You will not be disappointed, this one's a keeper.",1515974400,,1287,4.89908256880734
