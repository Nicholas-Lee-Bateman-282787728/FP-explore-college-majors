The other 3 movies of this series, including this one, are just basically rehashing more of the same information. Watch the first movie and skip the rest.",1390867200,,298,4.75
8165399,5,B000LZ56IA,"This a fascinating look at the mess we made of one of the world's most significant natural wonders and what is being done to, as much as possible, reverse the damage. What happened to the Everglades is a classic example of man's ignorance and disregard of the function of wetlands in nature. It is also an example of how people can come together with a common purpose to achieve a goal. This DVD and its companion volume present many sides to the Everglades' story intertwined with scenes from within and interviews with many scientists, ranchers, farmers, and other involved parties. This should be required of all Ecology and Environmental Science students and teachers.",1251244800,3,672,4.95575221238938
