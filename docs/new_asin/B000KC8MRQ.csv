He covers the grip, stance, swing path, preshot routine, release and waggle. He contrasts what is written in the book versus what Hogan actually did (likely from his near fatal car accident).

Historic footage of Ben Hogan's swing and vignettes by his contemporaries in the video give a perspective into the legendary golfer.

McLean includes drills that Ben Hogan illustrated in the 5 Lessons.

This video is not purely instructional and is useful as a supplement to the book.  You will not likely have the swing from just watching the video.

Whether you are a fan or a student of his 5 Lessons, this video is a must have for your library.",1221523200,,1177,6.267080745341615
8155530,3,B000KC8MRQ,"I found this DVD to be a disappointment.  Where I was looking for step-by-step instructions geared to a player who wants to review basics as well as learn some tips from a pro, entirely too much time is spent in this DVD trying to convince the viewer how great Ben Hogan was.  There are several interviews with other pros telling you how great he was, how he was always impeccably dressed, etc., etc.  You might not hear his entire life story but hordes of time are wasted on non-instructional material.  Don't get me wrong; there is solid instruction in this DVD.  You just have to be liberal in using the FF button on your DVD player to get at it without falling asleep.  After purchasing this disappointing DVD, I just bit the bullet and hired a golf pro for lessons.",1218499200,3,770,4.464285714285714
8155531,4,B000KC8MRQ,Jim McLean's narrative and old footage of Hogan's actual swing combine to make this video a worthwhile purchase. Some of the book's controversial points are explained and shown in clear footage and discussion by McLean.  This is a must have for anyone serious about adapting Hogan's basic fundamentals to his/her game.,1186617600,5,318,5.235294117647059
