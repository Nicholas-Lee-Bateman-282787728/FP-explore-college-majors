8332873,1,B001P9PWYO,i totally agree  with the one above me very disaponting though i didn't realy purchase a copy of it but rather get one from a friend of mine.  eventually i gave it away .,1378944000,,170,3.9705882352941178
8332874,4,B001P9PWYO,"Brian Auger is without a doubt one of the premier Hammond B-3 players of our generation. His approach is another angle, he does not use a ""Leslie"" Tone Cabinet, as most B-3 users. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because as a player myself, I bought this to learn from and maybe steal a few ""licks"". If he could have spent a little more time showing in a teaching way, Still it's a really good addition to my music video library.",1366848000,,425,4.132530120481928
8332875,3,B001P9PWYO,"No one can argue that Auger is a master  and most gifted... While his 251 concept is useful and somewhat universal ... The average player will struggle using the concept without making every free style solo sounding the same...he needs to spend more time developing the right hand chops that fit for various forms of music styles... Still, worthy of the money!... I'm glad I have it for study...and practice.  Thanks, Brian!",1363392000,,424,4.875
8332876,1,B001P9PWYO,"Very disappointing! Not instructional in the least. Mr. Auger is a conceited narcissistic bum. Yes, he can play, but he cannot teach or is just unwilling.",1358640000,,154,4.961538461538462
8332877,5,B001P9PWYO,"I probably should wait a little longer before I write the review.  I may be able to offer a little more insight when I have had more time to digest the material(s) within the DVD.

The DVD will definitely inspire any aspiring Hammond player.  It is saturated with interesting technique and crystal clear examples of exceptional Hammond playing.  Some of his work is hard to follow but this DVD is not necessarily for an entry level musician.  The more you know about music the more you will get out of this DVD.",1315612800,2,511,4.510869565217392
8332878,5,B001P9PWYO,"Not a concert DVD but an instructional one that comes off very entertaining as well. Brian ""The Auge"" Auger is the preeminent practitioner of the modern Hammond organ and he has not lost ANY of his chops over the years.
A must see DVD!!!",1247875200,3,237,4.409090909090909
