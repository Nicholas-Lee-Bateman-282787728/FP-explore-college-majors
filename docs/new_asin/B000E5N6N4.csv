8106185,5,B000E5N6N4,"I enjoyed my DVD... I got it on time, and in a fairly short time. The DVD was in great condition and it works great!  I never heard about this DVD Thanks again!",1368230400,,160,3.8484848484848486
8106186,3,B000E5N6N4,"A good but short documentary featuring heroics from different time periods. An attemt is made to link them together, which is not entirely sucessfull. Also contains the 10 best plays in playoff history and a small documentary of the greatest game of all time (5th game 1976 finals between the celtics and the suns). I think this documentary was also present in the Boston Celtics set in NBA' s Dynasty Series, but am not sure it is exactly the same.
Oberall I think the material is a poor collection",1207612800,,499,4.617977528089888
8106187,5,B000E5N6N4,I enjoyed the footage showed here that mainly focused on the 80's Nba&the great Battle in 69 between the Knicks&the Lakers.strong footage of those Great 80's Laker&Celtics teams as well.,1044144000,,186,5.233333333333333
8106188,4,B000E5N6N4,"Great video, with many amazing stories of teams fighting injuries and over-coming adversity in order to achieve greatness.  This video discusses many events, including Spud Webb's performance in the slam dunk championship, the 1984 playoff match between Pistons and Knicks, and the 1969 NBA Finals between the Lakers and Celitcs.  My one criticism is that this film is very similar to another NBA video, ""NBA Awsome Endings"".  This video is a good selection for Celtic and Laker fans, as well as fans of 1980s basketball and the great battles in NBA history.",1014595200,,558,5.043478260869565
