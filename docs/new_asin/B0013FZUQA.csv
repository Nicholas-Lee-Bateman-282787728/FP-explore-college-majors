3108373,1,B0013FZUQA,"At this point you would think that every movie lover should know that whether or not a movie is gonna be good should not be determined solely by the previews. I must admit that I fell for that once again because the previews really make this movie look interesting. Now, truth be told, I can't start popping off about the comparisons between the movie and the book like most people tend to do in their reviews because I never read the book. However, I do know what I like, and what I don't like, and this movie I didn't like friends. Not to take away from someone else that said it before me, but my only gripe was that nothing pertaining to the weeds got explained which I find frustrating in a movie. I think it cheats the viewers when they have to walk away from a movie with tons of unanswered questions. Like, what are these vines? where did they come from? and why they are only confined to the Mayan temple. I guess the blood and gore was suppose to distract us from these little minute tidbits. I won't bother to go over the plot because as we all know a group of Americans are on vacation in Mexico and they head off to explore an ancient pyramid engulfed with a man-eating plant species. I know it sounds far-fetched as hell, but it could've worked. The ending was also awful. I mean, are we suppose to guess whether or not the only survivor made it off the pyramid infested with these vines only to spread it to the outside world. I don't know. I recommend that you wait for video and save your money. However, not to be totally unfair, I've seen worse so it's worth watching at least once when you have absolutely nothing else to do.",1208649600,5,1645,4.309677419354839
3108374,4,B0013FZUQA,"Four American tourists, somewhere South of the border, on their last day of vacation and open for diversions, allow themselves to be talked into going to view a remote Mayan ruin with a European tourist they meet at the hotel. He is connected to a group who are executing an archeological dig at the ruin and he hasn't heard from them in a few days. So off the tourists all go, without a worry in the world.

Their first clue should have been the hostile reception they get from the native people who live nearby the ruin, who leave no doubt about where they stand on visitors...but by then it's too late to turn back. The group ascends the pyramid to try to find out the fate of the archeological team and to wait for rescue from anyone who might notice they are missing, and things rapidly go south from there.

This is my annual obligatory horror movie, and I have to say it held my interest. Definitely not for the squeamish...but if you're into horror movies, I doubt it will keep you up nights, although there is blood in plenty, some pretty nasty offings, and in a neat twist in the monster end of horror flicks, carnivourous plants that make the one in Little Shop of Horrors look like a well-mannered Pekinese. Well-acted for the genre, it was worth the time, and will leave you with the notion that the water isn't all you should be careful about in that region.",1207785600,6,1372,4.440476190476191
3108375,2,B0013FZUQA,"There's something to be said for sitting in an empty movie theater. The day I saw ""The Ruins""--a film adaptation of Scott Smith's novel--there was exactly one other person in the theater with me; he sat at the opposite end, and he made not a single noise, although he was eating popcorn one handful at a time. I have to treasure moments like this because, for the first time in ages, I watched a horror film without being distracted by inappropriate laughter and idiotic teenagers that scream just for the sake of screaming. Not that there's much to scream about in the case of ""The Ruins,"" a film with a plot so serious that it's paradoxically laughable. What we have here is a rare case: a movie too awful to be enjoyed and not awful enough to be campy good fun. It exists in a dull, derivative gray area somewhere between the two, so there's nothing much to get out of it other than ninety minutes away from home. No wonder there was only two of us in the theater.

The film opens with a shot of a woman engulfed in darkness, frantically trying to use her cell phone as she screams for help. She's suddenly grabbed by something and pulled into a pitch-black corner of wherever she is. The tension is immediately interrupted by the start of the story proper--while vacationing somewhere in Mexico, college students Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Eric (Shawn Ashmore), and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) meet a German tourist named Mathias (Joe Anderson), and he tells them of an off-the-beaten-path Mayan temple just begging to be explored. They all decide it would be worth a look. I ask you: What part of this idea seems plausible? Who in their right mind would venture into remote jungles with a completely unknown person? I guess it doesn't matter that Mathias has drawn his own maps to the area, a place supposedly kept secret.

There's a good reason for this. They arrive at the temple the next day, only to be surrounded by a group of villagers so isolated they don't even speak Spanish; Jeff and his group unknowingly step onto a patch of vines that shrouds the entire temple, and from then on, none of them are allowed to leave the site. But why? What's so bad about a patch of vines? It's eventually revealed that the temple is covered with a species of man-eating plant; its vines can surround a body in a matter of minutes, and God forbid you should have an open wound for them to enter. The rest of the film shows the tourists falling victim to this plant, beginning when one of the characters enters the temple via an opening at the top. They enter, you see, because they hear a cell phone ring tone coming from deep within--Mathias believes it's coming from his brother's phone, since they found his jeep not too far from the temple.

But there are other things to worry about besides the plant. Faced with the possibility of starvation, dehydration, and infection, the main characters slowly lose their rational minds. Some, like Stacy, are more directly affected; I won't reveal why, but rest assured it has something to do with the plants. Others, like Jeff, show subtler sings; he angrily holds onto the hope that everyone will be rescued. ""Americans on vacation don't just disappear!"" he snaps, and do I really need to explain why that's a bunch of baloney? He occasionally tries to take charge, probably because he's the goody-goody med school student that seems to know what to do for every injury he comes across. One of the film's most unnecessary scenes involved the amputation of one of the character's legs, and I'll never understand how Jeff came to that decision. It didn't even make sense as a plot device, simply because this isn't a horror film that supports cringe-inducing gore.

The only affective moment of this movie is the revelation that the plants are able to mimic sounds, such as Stacy screaming. Close ups of the red flowers show them vibrating whenever they make a noise, and this is frightening, I guess, because it shows that the plant is intelligent. The thing is, even a B movie plant monster is too good for a film this weak, unoriginal, and insignificant. ""The Ruins"" aims to tell a story the quick and easy way, and we see this through more than the flimsy character development and rehashed plot--every sequence goes from one to the next with very little payoff. Everything just sort of happens, and we're never given the opportunity to savor the moment.

This is especially true of the ending, which has resolution but doesn't stay on it long enough to satisfy. You watch this movie knowing that the filmmakers made very little effort, even in terms of scaring the audience. It was all about being quick and minimalistic, which would have been admirable under different circumstances. And by the way, yes, I get that this is supposed to be an escapist horror film, the kind you're just supposed to enjoy and not analyze. But how much fun can it possibly be if only two people decide to see it? I considered walking up to the man with the popcorn and asking him why we were the only ones in the theater, but I thought better of it; based on the fact that he never gasped, never laughed, and never applauded, the answer to my question seemed obvious. ""The Ruins"" will be forgotten almost as quickly as it was introduced, forcing it to retreat into some dark, secluded vault. Much like the vines of a man-eating plant.",1207699200,9,5372,4.638655462184874
3108376,4,B0013FZUQA,"This was a good horror film, if you don't mind gore.  (Not my bag.)  I saw it in the theater and I spent several times looking at the floor while people screamed on the screen. That said, it was scary, suspenseful, acting was good, plot was good. I did NOT read the book, so this review is based solely on the movie content.

The movie begins with 4 American young couples, (age 25 ish?) partying on the beach in Mexico.  A German guy joins their partying and he tells the 4 that his brother is on an archeological dig with the brother's girlfriend at some remote, off-the-map ancient Mayan temple deep in the jungle.  The German guy is going down there tomorrow.  Would the 4 like to join him and his friend?  Since it is the 4's last day in Mexico, they agree (well, 3 of them agree, and 1 reluctantly goes).

So, the 6 embark on this adventure in the morning.  They travel by bus for awhile to an old town, then they find a cab to take them farther.  The German guy has a map and shows it to the cab driver.  The cab driver immediately says, ""This place no good.""  (HINT!), but, they encourage him with $20 US dollars and off they go.  They arrive where the road ends, and now they must hike deep into the jungle.  Still following the map, they finally arrive at a clearing and a huge Mayan temple, covered with ivy and beautiful red poppy-looking flowers. (But don't let this green stuff fool you.  It makes poison ivy look like a Peace Lilly!  And the pretty red poppies are NUTHIN like Dorothy found in the field in the Wizard of Oz!)  But, I'm getting ahead of myself.

In the clearing, they meet some not-so-friendly natives, who speak something other than Spanish.  (It was not Mexican Castillian either).  Anyway, the natives already know how treacherous this poison ivy stuff is, so once some of the 6 touch it, the natives get real restless, forcing 5 of the 6 up the side of the temple.  The natives will not let them leave, so they are stranded on the temple.  Things begin to happen as people get hurt and the vine begins to attack.  (It can wrap around skin and tighten until it cuts, then it crawls inside.--NASTY!) And, those pretty little flowers can emulate sounds, and talk inside your head. There is some pretty gory stuff here, so if you can't stand blood and open cuts (and worse), spare yourself the flick.  But, if you like that stuff, then go for it.

I am happy to report that I did not have nightmares last night.  I rated it 4 star because it did what it did well, regardless of my lack of tolerance for these kind of movies.",1207526400,3,2555,4.337552742616034
3108377,3,B0013FZUQA,"I have the book by Scott Smith, upon which this movie is based, but unfortunately I haven't had the time to read it yet.  After seeing the film, however, I do want to read the book because I often find that the book is, indeed, better than its celluloid counterpart.

  This time around Smith (who also wrote 'A Simple Plan') takes us deep into the Mexican jungle.  A group of four young people who are spending their time in Cancun around the pool and drinking until they look like morons, meet Mattias, a German tourist who plans to visit his brother at an archeological dig.  Jeff, a pre-med student and the most level-headed of the bunch, along with his girlfriend, Amy and couple Eric and Stacy, set off with Mattias and Dimitri, a Greek tourist, to spend a day exploring the uncharted Mayan pyramid.

  Once at the pyramid, however, things take a horrific turn almost immediately when Mayans show up with weapons and will not allow the group to leave the area.  Unable to communicate with the agitated natives, the group climbs to the dig site, unaware of the terror they are about to face.  Atop the pyramid the young people slowly begin to realize what a nightmarish situation they have stumbled into with no viable way out.  Smith takes a normally beautiful part of nature and turns it into a monster and I find that one of the best parts of the films.  The travellers are stunned when they find out they are becoming victims to...we'll, I won't spoil that part of the film for you.

  'The Ruins' is a decent horror flick but didn't give me the willies like 'The Descent' did (the last horror movie I thoroughly enjoyed).  The scenes inside the pyramid were creepy but nothing compared to the claustrophobic terror that I felt during 'The Descent'.  It is, though, a good film and worth watching.  You may want to wait and enjoy it on dvd.  Its worth a rental but you may not want to fork out 10 bucks to see it on the big screen.",1207440000,3,1940,4.472934472934473
3108378,4,B0013FZUQA,"I went into ""The Ruins"" not really having any idea what it was about. It just looked interesting from the previews. The basic premise is a group of American twenty-somethings are on vacation in Mexico and on their last day decide to go see these ancient ruins that are not part of the normal tourist attractions. Once they get there things start going wrong, then they get worse. The suspence is held thruout the movie. There is a major element of the story that you just have to accept and once you do you're all set to enjoy the movie.
 My fear was that ""The Ruins"" would be like ""Touristas"" or ""The Cave"", it is like neither of these. It's more like ""Hostel"" in that the people don't really do anything overly stupid to get them into the situation they are in.
 Those who have read the book have complained about the ending. I didn't think it was a bad ending at all. I haven't read the book, but the end shown makes sense and leaves the viewer basically knowing what is going  to happen next without it being shown.
 If the movie teaches you nothing, it teaches you that if you go on vacation bring along some Weed-B-Gone, you never know when it will come in handy!!!",1207353600,14,1171,4.3577981651376145
3108379,2,B0013FZUQA,"When a group of friends get together for a vacation in Mexico, the last thing they think is that they'll wind up dead. Jeff and Amy are a couple who may be on the verge of collapse. Jeff is in med school 2,000 miles away from his sweetheart, and the distance manifests itself with Amy making out with anyone and everyone who is willing. Amy's best friend Stacy is also on the trip with her boyfriend Eric. The foursome are partying at their Mexico resort when a German named Matthias mentions that he has directions to some Mayan ruins that are a little off the beaten path. Determined to get in a little culture with their tequila, Jeff convinces the others that it will be a good idea. It's not.

The moment they find the ruins, a group of Mayan natives come bearing shotguns and bows and arrows (how cliche) and force the group deeper into the ruins. Pretty soon after their arrival, Matthias and Stacy are injured trying to find a missing cell phone at the bottom of a well. Jeff realizes that the locals have no plans on letting them leave. And the group realizes that the ivy surrounding their location just might be alive--and out for blood.

I slept with the lights on and felt things crawling on me when I went to sleep. The movie was a disappointment after that. First of all, the ending is different, and not in a good way. It's pretty evident that we're being left open for a sequel and who really wants to see two movies about a man-eating plant? Not me. Secondly, the action came and went pretty quickly with no real direction. There was no buildup. No tense moments while you wondered what would happen. Nope. I pretty much knew they were going to die. And it's a shame. The book left the road open for a lot of opportunity, and none of it was taken with this movie. If you're in the mood for a lackluster thriller with a predictable and trite ending, go ahead and see The Ruins film. But if you want to be scared and wonder about the banality of human cruelty, go ahead and read the book.",1207353600,9,2240,4.723785166240409
3108380,3,B0013FZUQA,"My wife and I both read Scott Smith's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ruins/dp/0307389715/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ruins)</a>"" two summers back when it came out, which is why she did not go to the theater this afternoon to see the movie version.  Previously she has left me sitting alone in the movie theater during showings of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakes-on-a-Plane/dp/B000JBXHQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakes on a Plane</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Terror/dp/B000XASD1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Terror</a>,"" and I am pretty sure that there is some sort of third strike rule here that I need to stay clear of (for the record, she walked out of parts of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>"" too, but she went with her mother and I was the chauffer and therefore not on a date).  So I returned from seeing the opening showing of ""The Ruins"" this afternoon, and reported to her that yes, indeed, the scenes that she did not want to see and in the movie, so we was wise to stay eating popcorn in bed and watching episode after episode of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-60-on-the-Sunset-Strip/dp/B00005JPI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a>,"" because she would have fled the theater.  Then she asked how the movie was, and I told her in one concise sentence was happens at the end.  She frowned and said, ""So they ruined it.""

Down in Mexico on Yucatan peninsula a pair of American couples are nearing the end of their vacation.  We have Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), along with Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey).  They meet up Mathias (Joe Anderson) and his friend Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas).  Mathias is trying to track down his brother, who is working on an archeological dig in the area.  The idea of seeing an ancient Mayan ruin that is not some sort of tourist trap is intriguing so they find a local taxi pickup truck and head out into the jungle.  Once there they find the path to the ruin, but as soon as they touch the bottom step a group of Mayans show up brandishing guns and other weapons, demanding that the visitors keep going the direction they are going and not return.  Once atop the ruins, the group is trapped.  Then things get worse.

Reading the novel will tell you most of what happens in this movie, but in adapting his screenplay to the screen, Smith has decided to switch who things happen to in this version of the tale.  Maybe this is just to surprise his readers, and maybe it is because some of these people look better in their underwear than others.  I cannot say that these changes hurt the story, because they do not.  Trying to cut out pieces of an insidious vine invading your body or doing major surgery with a rock and a knife is always going to make me cringe, and I have to think many people will feel the same way.  The problem with most of the film is that why all of the choice parts of the novel remain, albeit somewhat recast, most of the connecting tissue has had to be excised to get this film in at 91 minutes.  That means that one of the key aspects of the novel, the fact that these people are trapped for several days in the hot sun with next to nothing for food and water, is fast forwarded through in the movie.  One of the things that made the novel effective was that you had a real sense for how these people were spending hours not doing anything but living in fear.  Then every time they actually tried doing something, it only tended to make things worse.  All of that is essentially lost in this movie, which is where we lose the first star.

It is the ending that costs ""The Ruins"" a second star.  Yes, Smith wrote the screenplay, so it would seem that the finger of blame should be pointed in his direction, but I have seen way too many alternative endings (and multiple alternative endings), so I am well aware that directors and studios do not care about how good a book or a script is, they only care about what the test results tell them to think.  Because this is the sort of ending that a test audience might like, but only because they did not read the book and they have no appreciation for what makes a great ending in a horror film.  What allows hyperbolic copywriters to claim that ""The Ruins"" is the greatest horror novel of the 21st century (good to know that it is all downhill for the next 92 years) is that the ending of the book drives home the final nail in the coffin.  When this movie gets to what is essentially the same final scene as the book, the context is all different because of one massively monumental and stupid change.  That final shot is now rendered superfluous.",1207267200,23,4956,5.026894865525672
3108381,4,B0013FZUQA,"I never read the novel, but The Ruins is a worthy horror film for those with a strong stomach. There are two really disturbing scenes that put Hostel to shame and the camera doesn't shy away. I can't imagine what they cut out for the Unrated DVD (which you know is coming), but it probably isn't much. The cast is good overall (especially Laura Ramsey in a chilling performance) and there were only a couple of times when I sat shaking my head at the stupid things they said or did. A couple of times is not bad when compared to most horror films, besides it comes with the territory.

My only gripe is that the ""creature"" isn't shown enough (much like Cloverfield) which can add to the suspense, but by the end of the film I was hoping to see or learn just a little more about it.

All in all, The Ruins is one of the most shocking horror films I have seen in quite some time and worth a trip to the theater.",1207267200,40,909,4.159090909090909

I didn't feel it offered a good fright but it was certainly creepy. Creepy you ask? The name of the game here is 'different'. It is not going to be your standard serial killer or ghost. I think that is part of what is charming about both the movie and the book. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone by giving away details, but I think when faced with a situation as weird as this one it would be hard to react any differently then the way some of these people did. The set was beautiful and set in a jungle. I think they could have expanded on some of the scenes and made the main area a little bigger (by doing this they may have gotten into a little more danger). But maybe that was what the writer/director was going for: intimacy. How can things go so horribly wrong when other people are so very close and within a few feet of one another. Well, I suppose you will just have to sit and watch. All in all, it was entertaining but I probably won't watch it again simply because the love of the book was so strong and pretty different from the film (read the book...sorry guys I had to!).

The good:
- Original concept for the story
- Actors are good (not perfect, but definitely good)
- Great special fx (everything fits well and doesn't feel over done)

The Bad:
- The story is a little cliche at the beginning and at the very end (not enough to ruin the movie at all, but worth a mention)
- Can easily pick out who is most likely to survive it all (which is kinda standard in horror)

They encounter some renegade villagers who blow a guys brains out.  They force the scared kids up the hill and keep them trapped up there.

A man who went with them to find his brother is being lowered into the underground site.  The rope breaks and he takes a nasty fall to the bottom of the pit.  This turns into a survival story.  No food, limited water, and friends turning on each other.  But the killer vegetation is the real problem at hand.

These vines deceive us to believe there is a cell phone ringing  in the pit. They can give off sounds of human voices. The worst  weapon  of the vines is they get inside of an open sore and grow inside of you!  Lots of good effects as they cut open legs and a back to yank out these long strings of vines.

3108517,5,B0013FZUQA,"Scott B. Smith, writer of ""A Simple Plan"" (the novel and the 1998 movie), also wrote the 2008 novel & film ""The Ruins,"" which is about two college couples vacationing in Mexico who hook up with a German and visit an unknown Mayan pyramid off the beaten track. They are terrorized when local Natives surround the pyramid with deadly weapons, refusing to permit them to leave, and more horrified by the reason why!

""The Ruins"" refuses to make the mistake of too many conventional horror flicks by not going over-the-top with the situation, the ""monster"" or the horror/thrills, which makes these films more goofy than horrifying. For instance, take the ending of ""The Ruins"" (which is different than the book and, in my opinion, better): In a typical horror movie there would've been a wild (i.e. thrilling but totally unbelievable) vehicle pursuit by the Mayan descendants; not here. It's the BELIEVABILITY of ""The Ruins"" that makes it effective, which is reinforced by the notable acting of the five protagonists.

Speaking of which, I don't normally notice acting performances, but I found the acting stellar by the main protagonists - Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric and Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German. The two girls and Tucker (Jeff) especially stand out.

I found these protagonists likable and fairly fleshed-out for a 90-minute horror flick. For one, they're not the typical frat trash you see in so many horror movies. Secondly, we see signs of character again and again, which I detail below.

Some complain that the non-human antagonists are decidedly un-scary, but that's one of the main points of the movie. Like 1963's ""The Birds,"" it takes something we see every day and are NOT scared of and turns them into a source of horror.

One memorable scene is when Stacy and Amy are in the dark bowels of the pyramid searching for a cell phone they keep hearing. What they discover is equal parts shocking, surreal and amazing. More on this below. Another memorable sequence is when Jeff & Eric are forced to perform a gruesome operation. The ending is also well-done and suspenseful.

While the story takes place on the Yucatn Peninsula, Mexico, it was surprisingly shot at Gold Coast and Tamborine Mountain, Australia, just south of Brisbane, which is on the East coast. In any case, the locations are spectacular.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Ruins"" really surprised me in light of the inexplicable mediocre ratings and incessant panning. It's an adventure story mixed with psychological horror utilizing something common and un-scary as the ""monster."" It features quality gore, excellent locations & props, top-of-the-line performances and quality filmmaking in general. Plus it takes advantage of the presence of Laura Ramsey and eschews the overdone cartoony-ness of too many horror flicks, which are more funny than creepy or horrifying. In other words, ""The Ruins"" delivers the goods.

The theatrical version runs 90 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes. I viewed the latter.

GRADE: B+ or A- (a strong 4/5 Stars or weak 5/5 stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

The plants that live on the pyramid and what they are able to do spur a fascinating point: The animal kingdom spans the spectrum of worms to human beings. What about plant life? The plants at the Mayan ruins are obviously from the higher-developed end of the plant kingdom - they work as a team to obtain sustenance and are able to mimic sounds, like human voices and the ringtone of a cell phone, etc.

I've heard complaints about how the protagonists constantly make the wrong decisions. Answer: The foursome had befriended Mathias and therefore trusted him. They wanted to experience some Mayan history off the beaten track. When the Natives suddenly arrive on the scene and brutally shoot one of their members in the head the only place for them to safely flee is the pyramid. At that point they're stranded because the Natives have the ruins surrounded. How is any of this a wrong decision?

Besides, show me a list of the most popular horror flicks and I'll be able to cite way more ridiculous decisions by the protagonists than seen in ""The Ruins.""

Someone complained that the youths never attempt to escape the pyramid until it is basically too late, which supposedly defies logic. Answer: They're only on the pyramid for two nights and were waiting for help to arrive. Their only other recourse was to make a run for the jungle, which was impossible because the pyramid was surrounded by Natives with deadly weapons who already proved they would kill without mercy anyone infected by the plants. As such, the most logical thing to do was to wait for help and only make a run for it (to the jungle) if they absolutely had to, which is what happens. Sounds logical to me.

I've heard the criticism that the protagonists are imbeciles with little character development. I found them likable, as noted above, and there are numerous examples of character: They desire to experience the culture of the area and not just utilize their exotic vacation to party, like the average one-dimensional spring-breakers. Also, they refuse to leave Mathias for dead in the pyramid and the girls risk going down the same dubious rope that resulted in his fall. Moreover, Jeff insists on performing the gruesome task of cutting off Mathias' legs and Eric agrees to help even while the primitive operation causes him to vomit. Lastly, Jeff willingly sacrifices himself so that Amy has a chance to escape and she makes a bold dash for freedom. All this sounds like character to me.

Needless to say, the criticisms leveled at the film are mostly invalid or easily explained.",1424476800,,5738,4.912190082644628

3108543,2,B0013FZUQA,"Such a great novel turned into such crap.  I'm not going to spoil the ending by pointing out that it is completely lame.  I am going to complain a bout the visual where the place the vine is growing is a Mayan Temple.  The entire scene where they enter the Maya territory  is completely wrecked, and would have been a better use of footage to do it honestly rather than watching twenty minutes of the girls in their bikinis coming on to the boys.  Scott Smith describes the hill as (and please note there is no Maya temple in here): ""This clearing wasn't a field.  It looked like a road but it wasn't that either.  It was as if a gang of men had planned to build a road....On the far side of it rose a small hill.  The hill was rocky, oddly treeless, and covered with some kind of vinelike growth...""  Where from that do you get the steps of a Maya temple?  The headman of the village in this movie doesn't even have Maya features.  It's a shame that Hollywood once again could not get this right.  I'm with Steven King, the book is one of the creepiest I have ever read.  The movie takes the low and easy road, and arrives pretty much nowhere.  The vines look like Christmas decorations!  Unbelievable!  Where is the slimiest?  Where is the evil?  And don't blame it on the Maya, they're just trying to contain it.",1409788800,,1315,4.297959183673469

3108564,3,B0013FZUQA,"The Ruins, a dark and visceral novel of modern horror by Scott Smith, has been named as The best horror novel of the new century (Stephen King). Published on July 18th 2006 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., the film rights for the story adaption of The Ruins were sold to Red Hour Films before the novel was even completed. Scott Smith, being a friend of Red Hour Films owner Ben Stiller, had shown the film company the outline of the novel along with the first three chapters of the book during the writing process. Stiller and his company snatched up film rights then and there, requesting that Smith also write the film adaptation for the book. The company then produced, filmed, and released the film adaptation by April of 2008, a mere 2 years after the books original release.
 The Ruins focuses on a group of young college-aged Americans who travel to the wild interior of the Yucatan in search of an archaeological dig site. Upon finding the ruins, the group quickly discovers that the location is much more sinister and terrifying than anything they expected. The story quickly develops into one of survival and human frailty. While many of the stories elements are adapted or changed for the purpose of film, the integral meaning is carried between the novel and the traditional film adaptation.
 The original text has a slow burn, melting off like wax on a candle until there is nothing left of the characters in the end. The young group members spend much of the 509 pages deliberating methods of survival in the harsh wilderness before slowly be widdled down, physically and emotionally, and picked off one by one. The film on the other hand feels more like an intense napalm, burning liquid fast to its end in less than an hour and a half. The planning becomes condensed to a small portion of the film before the bloody attacks come upon the characters.
 The film, though bearing a remarkably close resemblance to the novel, is a less satisfying rendition of the themes of survival and human frailty. It keeps the integral meaning but fails to interweave it among the characters. In the end it seems as if The Ruins is more of a teaser for what is to come in the novel. By dropping the element of building tension we lose much of the fear that is inherent in the text.  Likely, the strongest contributing factor to this loss is the change to the ending of the story. The small amount of hope introduced through the films final shot manages to extinguish the riveting and terrifying note the book ends on.
 As its own creature the film is an entertaining and remarkable work. The text alone is simply the best horror novel I have read in many years. Together, there is much to glean from both versions of this macabre story.

3108579,3,B0013FZUQA,"As you've probably noticed, a lot of reviewers are complaining about a lack of character development. And to be honest, they are justified in that complaint. There really is no character building, so when the characters perish, which some obviously do, you really won't care. And even if you did care, there is no evil villain or torturous entity that makes their deaths memorable or necessary. To put things into perspective, and to give you an idea of what this movie is, nobody gets killed by plants. The problem here is that while the book focused on psychological trauma and less on the actual plants, the movie does neither. This would have worked well in the film, but the screenwriters decided to throw out the psychological aspects of the book and simply create an evil plant that really is there and really does feast on human flesh. Problem is, you don't really see much of the plants, just some moving vines that do eventually, briefly, get inside one person. So is it a movie about a killer plant? No. It's about a group of college kids stranded on top of a Mayan temple harassed by the locals with guns and bows. The characters are stereotypical drivel. There is the foreign guy they meet who takes them to the temple, the heroic male lead, his whiny girlfriend, the crazy partying blonde and her nerdy whiny boyfriend. Is it about the psychological trauma that they each endure? No. There's none of that. So why watch it other than to see people get killed? Well, there really is no reason to. If you're a die hard horror fan than maybe you'll like it for it's decent production values, nasty, well done gore, and brief flashes of jungle cinematography. I went to the same high school as the director, Carter Smith, and I admire his efforts. He's not a seasoned director and this is his second feature length film. With that said, it's a phenomenal achievement. I hope he goes on to bigger and better things, and I wish him all the best luck.

The movie seemed to take some of the major events from the book and display them in (somewhat) shocking detail.  The characters were switched around and eliminated willy-nil.  But those things were not what the movie lacked and made it mediocre:  There was little, if any, exploration into the emotional and psychological factors that plagued each of them.  So we really didn't get to know them; we didn't see the devastating effects of the food and water scarcity.

The movie revolves around some twenty-somethings going deep into the jungle to an old pyramid that the natives are frightened of...for good reason.  They get trapped there by the natives, who won't let them leave...also, for good reason.  Turns out the pyramid is covered inside and out with these vines that have a mind (and agenda) all their own.

I think that the most creepy part was how the plants kept trying to get inside of people.  That definitely had a good ick factor going for it.  Plants as the ""monster"" is not your typical bad guy and somehow the way the leaves and vines moved all on their own was kinda unsettling.

***************************

It's too bad, because I was getting into this movie. In fact, it was just starting to remove the bad taste of The Cave, when the vines became suddenly sentient and started actively attacking the two girls, after it was discovered the vines' flowers were producing the mysterious ring of a cell phone. First, CG is always a bad idea, and in a movie like this, it should be completely unnecessary. Second, the idea of a sentient, malevolent plant that moves impossibly fast and responds intelligently and can magically adapt to mimic different sounds is pretty ludicrous. Lots of things I could nit-pick and really, I'm not being critical just to be critical -- this aspect of the film is what ruined it (haha) for me. If they had stuck with the vines moving very slowly, growing over night, and if the 'sound' being produced was limited to the ringing and a very nebulous ringing, then I probably would have been able to accept it. The idea that the plant could make a sound to lure them was pretty creepy and a good idea -- I just think it was way overdone from what was necessary.

The plant slowly growing overnight toward them, in the manner of vines, was just fine and more than scary enough. A faint, distorted ring, would have been much creepier than so accurately reproducing the cell phone ring, not to mention their voices... like a talking parrot. They really took it beyond reasonable limits with the voice mimicking.

Oh and the vine grabbing the torches... that were burning with oil-soaked rags (alcohol, whatever) ... wouldn't a plant, especially a 'smart' plant (not that I'm in any way condoning it) draw back, away from fire? How did the fire go out, without setting the entire vine patch aflame? While we're on this line of thought, why didn't they try burning the vine to begin with, as soon as they found out it was after them? This too, did not make any sense.

Other than these quibbles, the film was actually quite good and somewhat better than I was expecting. There's a brief topless scene (getting dressed), and a fair amount of skin shown, but nothing too crazy. I'm on the fence as to whether this is worth owning, but there's definitely much worse out there.",1320105600,,2245,4.690355329949239

Much of what made reading the book so good was getting into the mind of each character.  Plus-it seemed so much of what made the story so scary and fraught with tension was absent here.

3108609,2,B0013FZUQA,"I'll admit right upfront, I've never read the book that ""The Ruins"" is based from. So, I can't really comment on how true the movie is to the original story. What I can say, though, is that this movie did nothing to make me want to seek out the book it is based on.

I really wanted to like this movie. I've been so hoping for a good rated R horror movie for some time. All these remakes and torture films masking as horror, have really had me thinking maybe no one knows how to make a new and original horror movie anymore. I was praying ""The Ruins"" would change that feeling for me, but it has only intensified it.

The film starts off well enough, with a couple of young college couples vacationing in Mexico, when they are given the opportunity to check out some ""off the tour guide"" ruins, before they have to leave. The first 30-40 minutes of the film is pretty solid stuff. You even come to like the characters a little.

Once they reach the ruins, though, the movie starts to lose it. It never is explained exactly where these vines came from, or what the deal with them is. We come to see the nearby villagers are trying to keep them from spreading, but we don't know how or why. The whole threat the vines pose really isn't given any kind of explanation, which only leads to unsatisfying questions that don't get answers.

There are a few really gory moments in the film, but most of it happens within the last third of the film. And by this point, you really just don't know what to make of anything that you care a whole lot about it. It just feels like gore for the sake of it.

The only truly ""jump from your seat"" moment is when the girls first come to learn of the danger the vines represent, otherwise there is little in the way of suspense in the movie. In fact, the vines seem to do less damage to these tourists, than they end up doing to themselves. So they don't seem to pose much of a threat, after all. And when the lone survivor escapes, you are left wondering what this means for the rest of the world, since keeping the vines contained was made into such an important point in the film. And the ending of the film? Total rubbish, which is all I have to say about that.

""The Ruins"" starts off like a classic horror film from the late 70's and early 80's, but soon degenerates into little more than a plodding and uninteresting film, that relies on some torturous moments of gore to try to shock you awake again. It almost feel disingenuous to call it a horror film, since the only thing to provide you with horror, is the realization that you aren't going to get the those 91 minutes of your life back. If there was a moral to this movie, I guess it would be to stick to the tourist traps, when you are in a strange country. But I'd impart the additional moral to stick to renting a good horror movie, over viewing this poorly done effort.",1311811200,,2866,4.259191176470588
3108610,3,B0013FZUQA,"Tourists visiting a Mayan temple become trapped in terrifying situation, in The Ruins (2008), a horror adventure set in the jungles of Mexico.  The film earns some points for originality, as the visitors are held as virtual prisoners, and are threatened by strange flesh craving vegetation.  The situation quickly goes from bad to worse for the tourists, whose most every move results in a disaster.  The film does feature some decent special effects, creatively designed carnivorous plants, and some messy gore, that should provide some thrills for horror fans.

Four Americans hook up with some German tourists, joining them on a trip into the jungle to visit an archeological dig.  The group make their way to an ancient Mayan temple that is partially covered with vegetation.  At that point, a group of native people with weapons suddenly appear.  When Amy (Jena Malone) steps on some vines, the agitated natives kill one of the tourists, and force the rest of the group to climb to the top of the temple.

At the top, they find a couple of tents, and a winch setup over a shaft that goes down into the center of the temple.  With no working phones, Mathias (Joe Anderson) is lowered down into the shaft, when a phone is heard ringing below.  Unfortunately, the rope breaks, and Mathias breaks his back after falling to the bottom.  Stacy (Laura Ramsey) and Amy descend into the shaft, and with Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) manning the winch, the group manages to lift Mathias up to the top.

Things start to get messy, as the survivors discover that the vines can move, enter the body, and even kill.  Stacy finds that the vines have entered a wound in her leg.  Well aware of how dangerous the plants are, the natives are determined to keep the group from leaving the temple.  Mathias' condition worsens, leading to a rather crude amputation of his legs.  This is followed by more surgery, as Jeff cuts into Stacy, pulling out vines moving through her flesh.  After another crisis and more bloodshed, the survivors make a dash for freedom.

While the deadly vines don't really do that much, killer vegetation makes for a nice change of pace, and the related special effects while low key, are executed pretty well.  The film manages to get by, with the action limited to the top of the temple, the cavern inside, and a few selected views of the ground below.  Attention is directed only on the side of the temple with steps.  Presumably the other three sides are ignored because they are covered with vines, but it's a pretty convenient plot hole, that facilitates Amy's escape attempt.

The characters are not complete idiots, and there is usually some intelligence behind their actions, but unfortunately they have bad luck in almost everything they try, and usually wind up compounding their troubles.  Although you may not really like the group a lot, overall the acting is pretty good for what the film is.  Laura Ramsey does a very good job as Stacy, as the character kind of slowly slides into a self-destructive madness.  Jena Malone's Amy is often quite annoying, but she does step up at those times when it really counts.

The DVD has a solid set of extra features, including a commentary with director Carter Smith and editor Jeff Betancourt, deleted scenes, and various featurettes.  Adapted from a book by Scott Smith, who also wrote the screenplay, the plot of The Ruins isn't that believable, but it holds together well enough, and without too many scenes of annoying dialog, the film moves along briskly, providing some tense moments and brief scares.",1306972800,,3592,4.817292006525285

The movie has a sense of panic that makes the movie even more intense. The whole ""flesh-eating vines"" thing is kind of weird, but it's unique, also, since nobody ever really did that a horror film before. ""The Ruins"" also gets pretty gruesome after an hour. The grossest scene is this leg amputation scene (bloody!). It just gets bloodier from on there. The ending is also intense, and to be honest, it ends pretty well, with just a little cliffhanger.

The pros
 Nice interesting setting. The story is interesting with a group of people visiting some ancient ruins and getting into trouble with a group of Mayans. I though the cast did a great job and acted their parts well. I found a plant as the main protagonist to be a change of pace and some what interesting. The film is bloody for those who like that sort of thing. As a fan of the book it was cool to see these characters and setting visualized on the big screen. This unrated version also has some deleted scenes and director commentary. The effects people did a good job making every thing look good in my opinion.

The cons

The film doesn't have any of the character development of the book. Characters roles and situations are switched around which I didn't care for. The vine is a lot more scary in the book and does more to scare and unsettle the characters in the book. The ending was changed from the book which is inferior to the book's ending to me. A number of events of the books are missing which really hurt the film in my opinion. Some scenes of violence may disturb some. One scene were a characters gets his legs cut off is very gory. Missing the heart and soul of the film. You don't get the same sense of foreboding doom like the book. The film tries to rush through things to fast.

conclusion.

A pretty decent version of the book. Worth watching for hardcore fans of the book,but inferior to the book. They gutted out some of the best parts of the book. A number of the best parts of the book which raised the fear and tension are gone here. I'd suggest reading the book over this any day. I hope somebody comes along one day and makes a more faithful version of the book.",1282521600,,1973,4.421487603305785
3108631,1,B0013FZUQA,"I hate horror movies that make me laugh.  From the films opening shot of that chick screaming in such an unconvincing and stereotypically obnoxious manner I knew that this movie was going to be an unintentional riot.  It delivered in that regard.  I have yet to read the book from which this film was adapted.  I hear mixed things about it.  One thing that I hear the most though is that the book is FAR better than the film, so I may have to check it out eventually.

The movie follows a group of really stupid American youngsters as they are eaten alive by some carnivorous plants surrounding some `off the map' ruins.  The group is attempting to gain some culture in their last day in Mexico and so they blindly follow some German guy they meet at the hotel pool who happens to tell them that he is going to meet his brother and some chick he just met out by the ruins the following day.  They decide to tag along and they regret it almost immediately when a group of savage Mayans trap them atop the ruins and refuse to let them leave.  They are baffled, but once the plants start hissing and biting them they realize that the Mayans are afraid of these idiot American's spreading the disease that is these ungodly plants.

The group then has to find a way to survive, or at least that is what you would think they would do.

I have so many issues with this horrible movie that it is almost pointless to try and list them all.  First of all, the plants are laughably un-scary.  When they actually perform their first real attack on the two girls I almost spit out my beer it was so funny.  The computer animated look to the whole thing was just ridiculous.  The scare factor is lost in the way in which the scenes are shot.  It is also lost when you consider how annoyingly retarded these kids appear to be.  They do NOTHING right and in the end you are just begging for the plants to quite wasting their time and just eat these stupid kids.  They make one ridiculous decision after another, from leaving a wounded friend mere inches from the plants unattended when they could have easily moved him to repeatedly trying to calm a hysterical friend with a knife.  They never truly attempt an escape until it is basically too late, which defies all logic.

I'm baffled at the lack of intelligence the script allots these characters.

The acting is actually the perfect compliment to the script, stagy and unrealistic, kind of like the characters.  I used to really like Jena Malone and I thought she would have a great career...but she appears to know nothing about evolving as an actress and her performance here is just awful.  Jonothan Tucker is annoyingly unattractive, and the way he talks is a distraction.  Laura Ramsey is beautiful to the eyes, and one of the more convincing aspects of the film, so I won't attack her or Shawn Ashmore too much, even though they are hindered by the scripts lack of attention to detail.  They come off as one-dimensional, which is a shame since this film really could have used some character development.

In the end this film is just lazy.  It doesn't really try to do anything and so it succeeds in being a forgettable mess.  The gore is there, and the amputation scene is genuinely squeamish, but it winds up being a mere moment of gratification in a film that serves no purpose other than to annoy the audience with its lack of intelligence.",1281916800,2,3389,4.47557003257329

3108643,3,B0013FZUQA,"There's plenty here we've seen before - young good looking American 20-somethings  with horrible things happening to them, and we the audience wondering which if any will survive.  However, it's done in such a way as to adequately build some genuine tension, and along the way build some characters which may not be exactly likeable, but are at least believable.  At least we start to care if they survive, which makes this a cut above many of this ilk.  In this movie, they naively take a detour from their beach `n' booze vacation to explore some Mayan ruins which mysteriously do not appear on any of the maps.  When they arrive at the vegetation covered ruins, they find themselves quarantined by some particularly belligerent natives, and things quickly deteriorate as they begin to realise the natives have good reason to be afraid of the Ruins, and of never letting a soul leave alive.
The director does not overplay the gore (even though it IS in places gory) and it plays for the most part as a survival pic.  If the movie is in genre terms routine, it has some plusses.. the little known cast do a decent job, and the maguffin they are scared of is kind of a neat idea, even if somewhat stretching the realms of believability.  The scenes that work best are the claustrophobic scenes with the relationships between the friends believably unravelling as the threat and tension mounts.  If the horror element is too tame for horror fans, but a little strong for a more mainstream audience, the sugar that makes the pill go down is when you take this as a character piece.. that's when it works best.
Somewhat of an oddity then, this is not without merit... if you've seen the trailer though, you probably know most of what happens.  Worth a rent.",1274918400,2,1754,4.650485436893204
3108644,1,B0013FZUQA,"The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie ""The Ruins"" is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of ""A Simple Plan,"" adapting his own bestselling novel, sticks steadfastly to the standard clichs and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense, we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore, unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed, ""The Ruins"" provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines.

The set-up for ""The Ruins"" resembles the 2006 horror movie ""Turistas"" where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed, ""Turistas"" generated some legitimate thrills and chills. ""The Ruins"" spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill.

The rest of ""The Ruins"" borrows from another movie: ""The Descent,"" a superb, 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind, too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic ""The Lost Continent"" about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (1961)about a New York florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop..

""The Ruins"" unfolds in the scenic, sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the ""X-Men"" movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of ""The Covenant""), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of ""Sleepers"") and Amy (Jena Malone of ""Pride & Prejudice""), are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool, but a helpful Teutonic, twentysomething tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson of ""Copying Beethoven"") recovers it, and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party, and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept.

First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going, you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left, and they haven't done anything adventurous, our two couples along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend, Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear, you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat.

No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted, and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually, the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, ""The Ruins"" turns into ""Bug,"" the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison, it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame.

""The Ruins"" ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it.",1268784000,,4649,5.102496714848883

Guess what happens when a group of college students and some newly acquired foreign friends - none of whom know Spanish, or any other useful, local foreign language for that matter - decide to do some remote exploration while on vacation in Mexico?

Couples Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) and Eric (Shawn Ashmore - Iceman from X-Men) decide to eschew leisurely beach resort activities to visit a remote archeological dig, proposed by their new friends Mathias (Joe Anderson) and Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), discovering a remote Mayan temple.  Immediately thereafter, armed men on horseback ride up and surround the tourists.  Hostilely barking orders, the locals shoot an arrow into Dimitri's chest, following it up with revolver fired head shot, splattering brains everywhere.  Terrified, the friends make their way up the vine-covered ruins that look suspiciously sacrificial.  For some reason, however, the men do not pursue, leaving the tourists quarantined.  Once atop the pyramid, the tourists learn they have more to fear than the men below.

For a fairly predictable horror movie, the filmmaking and script is nonetheless terrifying.  Creeping, insidious terror and obvious danger are used efficiently in this film.  Add in a healthy dosage of gore, a vicious amputation, the worst two surgeries one could wish upon their worst enemy, and the result is a complete loss of all hope.  Even though the character development was nonexistent I didn't care.  What I did care about was the fact that not a single person tried to actively fight back against their impending deaths (vine grenades anyone?); that was aggravating.

Despite the fact that I could constantly predict the next scene, it's nonetheless heart-stopping.  A new, creative perspective on suspenseful horror-thriller without sparing quality, The Ruins will cause me to stay ON the beaten path more often than not.

SPOILER:
For those who doubt the believability of this film, and the evolutionary concepts proposed, I encourage looking up the plant Nepenthes Attenboroughii, and following it up with the talented exploits of the Lyre Bird (great video on Youtube).

The gore isn't constant, but when it is used it is very effective..the surgery scene is as bad as anything I've seen on film, including the so-called ""torture porn"" genre.  Some other reviewers mock ""The Ruins"" for having a plant as it's monster, but I thought that it was cool and not something I'd seen before.

Two pairs of fairly witless young folks decide to team up with a young German vacationer to venture into the jungle where his sister is an archaeologist investigating an obscure Mayan temple ruin. When they finally arrive at the site, the locals make them wish they'd never heard of the place... and that's hardly the end of their troubles -- killer vines abound!

The screenplay comes from the Scott B.

The acting is actually pretty good as horror films go and the camera work is equally good. Also, the two shapely girls are very easy on the eyes, including Jena Malone (as Amy) and Laura Ramsey (as Stacy.) The film features some brief sexual content.

There are some really dumb aspects to this film but to reveal them would generate a number of significant spoilers... so I won't disclose those incidents here. Just take my word for it that as people get injured, the two boyfriends aren't very skilled as first-aiders.

The movie runs for 90 minutes (the unrated version runs for 93 minutes) and the aspect ratio is 2.35:1. All the film footage was actually shot in Australia but the locations look real enough.

3108655,2,B0013FZUQA,"Relatively spoiler free thoughts:
The Ruins falls into the ""people making bad decisions"" type of movie.  Every problem that befalls our characters ultimately stems from bad decisions that they make.  Chief among those bad decisions...?  Taking a 20 mile taxi ride to the middle of nowhere in a jungle in Mexico into an area with no cell service and LETTING THE TAXI DRIVER LEAVE!  Just going to hike back through the jungle huh guys?  Sure there's a Jeep there but they don't know if they'll be able to find the person with the keys and didn't even try to stop the taxi driver or ask him to come back later.

They do this type of thing often.  They end up going to the ruins they came to see and are quickly encircled by some crazy men waiving guns around who won't let them leave.  On top of the pyramid they hear a cell phone down in a deep dark hole.  Never mind that none of them have cell service (and have not had it for quite some time while hiking) and another phone in the same location down inside a pyramid should have no chance - and that it keeps ringing and ringing and never going to voice mail, let's drop down in there and get it!  Granted they were pretty freaked out.  I think I'd still check the rope that's been out in the elements for who knows how long first before I let my friends drop me in a hole though.

Before long several of the crew are hurt and they start to learn why they've been quarantined.  And they begin to be picked off one by one in various ways.  Good thing the characters are the typical 1 note fair so we're not too emotionally involved.  There's whiny girl, likable guy, other whiny girl who turns out to be tougher than she looks, bossy guy, injured guy and guy who gets killed really early on so we know this movie means business.

Some silly plot elements, unlikable and uninteresting characters and a lack luster ""monster"" make this a pretty lame movie.  It did have a few creepy moments and decent effects though and a couple of gory moments.  It's a one watcher.

Slightly more spoiler filled discussion:
 OK the monster is a plant.  You probably already knew that.  As far as a monster antagonist goes it wasn't very good.  It demonstrates that it is fast and strong and fully capable of grabbing a person and dragging them off yet it instead tries to use traps and slowly sneak up on people while they sleep.  Must not have been a very hungry plant.  It has the ability to mimic sounds, which is an interesting concept but not used very well in my opinion.  I will say this though, seeing the plant grow up inside of people and killing them is pretty creepy and a scene where whiny girl tries to cut the plants out of her is easily one of the bloodiest moments in the film.

The idea of these people quarantining the pyramid so this plant can't spread is also interesting but wouldn't it make more sense to scare people away instead of letting them get there and then keeping them there to die?  I kind of got the sense that these people were trying to do a good thing but it seems they chose a weird way of doing it.  The movie even starts with another person trapped in the pyramid before our group arrives.  I'm starting to think these guys are just jerks.

In the end the less whiny girl gets away though and nothing is made of that.  We just see some new folks showing up at the pyramid (Hey guys! Scare them away this time don't just let them.... Too late).  The whole point was that these guys were quarantining our group in so I'd have thought that seeing the plant spreading because she got away would be a more sensible ending.  Oh well, I'm no film maker.  Much of this plot seemed silly to me.",1254441600,,3659,4.307467057101025

Not so good was the movie itself.  The premise of the movie, best described as shrubs gone wild, doesn't really lend itself to building much tension, much less actual horror.  It doesn't help that the killer plants, especially on the blue ray version, don't look that real.

Without any tension, the film becomes more of a gorefest, and with an amputation scene and a self-mutalation scene, it delivers to that on some extent.

And when will these dumb American tourists ever learn?  You'd think that, after all those cheapjack horror movies, they'd have figured out that the minute some smooth-talking stranger in a foreign land offers to take them on a private tour to some ""off-the-beaten-path"" attraction, the only sensible response would be to run as far and as fast as possible in the opposite direction.  You'd think so.  But instead they inevitably pile into a rickety old pickup (or bus or motor scooter or whatever mode of transportation happens to be available in that particular movie) and eagerly head off to a place that even Vincent Price wouldn't be caught dead going to on his creepiest day.

In ""The Ruins,"" the victims are two American couples - Jeff and Amy and Stacy and Eric - who are just wrapping up their vacation in Mexico, and the stranger a charming German man who offers to escort them to a mysterious Mayan temple buried deep in the secluded jungle.  Before you know it, the five of them are at the mercy of some murderous locals who, for some initially undisclosed reason, refuse to allow them to leave the structure.

Though there's a decent amount of suspense in the early stretches of the film - and even one pretty nice turnaround in the plot - once the ""true nature"" of the menace is revealed, the movie becomes tedious and silly.  Moreover, it expends more effort trying to gross us out than actually scaring us.  I mean, just how many dismemberments and anesthesia-free operations are we expected to sit through before finally crying uncle?

In the final analysis, ""The Ruins"" proves once and for all - for those who may have found themselves doubting it - that there's only so much compelling drama one can wring out of a bunch of people stuck on the top of a pyramid.",1250899200,,2004,4.7

3108673,3,B0013FZUQA,"When I first read ""The Ruins"" two years ago, I remember enjoying the tense atmosphere created by the author and was wondering how the book would translate into a movie. Well, they did make a movie out of it, and predictably, a couple of things get lost in translation. The book was highly atmospheric and tense - these are a group of young people who get trapped on a sort of pyramid for days, battling their fears, sense of isolation, and the very real threat posed by the vegetation that grows around the place.

In the movie, the roles of the young people are ably portrayed by Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, and Joe Anderson as Matthias. It all begins on a lark - Matthias is trying to locate his brother, who is working on a dig somewhere deep in the forests of the Yucatan Peninsula. The two American couples decide to go along with him for fun. The idea of exploring some unexplored ancient Mayan ruins is just too irresistible and eventually they do locate the place, only to find themselves trapped there as the locals will not let them leave the ruins.

The cast is the strength of this movie - the actors really do get into their respective roles and the chemistry comes across as natural and not forced. These are characters that one comes to genuinely care about and sympathize with, unlike other B-grade horror flicks where one couldn't care less what happens to the mostly idiotic and immature cast.

The effects are not shoddy either - and there are some really gory effects in here - involving cutting out the creepy, 'malicious' vines out of bodies etc, not for the faint of heart.

In adapting the book for the big screen, some liberties have been taken with the plot, and even the characters are portrayed as doing stuff that is different than in the book. The ending was a disappointment to me as it was totally different than the book, but all in all, this is a pretty decent horror thriller and the suspense holds for much of the movie.",1247356800,,2019,4.508196721311475

Usually a masked killer that can't be stopped, some type of crazed creature, or a mysterious entity rule in the world of scares but not this time. Oh no this time our poor cast must attempt to survive the wrath of some fast growing highly intelligent vines. Certainly the premise is quite different from what we're used to which is refreshing. However the way it played out in this one left us more bored then anything else.

Two coulpes head on down to Mexico for a little relaxing vacation. On their second to last day they decide to take a trip to explore some ancient Mayan ruins. They aren't content checking out the well known ruins though. They want to find one with no tourists for the real effect. They meet a man named Mathais who is in search of his brother working on an archeological site and shows the crew where to go. Once they get to their destination they are chased up the ruins by a gang of crazed Mayan's. As they are stranded they begin to realize the people are less of a threat then the vines growing everywhere. These vines know how to mimic sounds and voices to send the crew through a psychological test of survival in which some fail miserably.

Upon our explination you may think the film sounds great, but it's not. It does have a very interesting premise and some decent acting. The problem is the film is way drawn out and the characters really begin to get on you nerves. Usually films based off of books never live up to the challenge as The Ruins proves. If you have the chance to catch it you may want to check it out since some people rave about it. Guess it's in the eye of the beholder here.

3108677,4,B0013FZUQA,"""The Ruins"" is arguably an under-rated horror film. The plot centers around a group of four twenty-somethings (it's implied they are in their early twenties, due to one character's comments about medical school) who decide to take an expedition into the Yucatan rain forest in search of an unmarked ruin that one of the character's sister, an archaeologist, had been searching for. They find the ruins, but unfortunately, the ruins are guarded by a group of local Indians - and once one of the characters makes the mistake of touching the ruins, the Indians shoot at and frighten them until they are effectively quarantined upon the ruins (a pyramid, to be exact).

Confused and frightened (one of this film's strong points is the acting, which is excellent throughout the film from the largely unknown cast), the characters explore the pyramid while struggling to think of a way to escape their ""guards"". What they find is that the pyramid is infested with a rapidly-growing, highly dangerous carnivorous vine, which the Indians have kept at bay on the pyramid by salting the ground surrounding it. The vine continually encroaches upon the main characters in their prison.

As mentioned earlier, one of the strong points of this film was the acting, which is well-done throughout the movie. This is complemented by the beautiful scenery.

The movie's main weak point is that the premise is inherently limiting. Once the characters are quarantined, the movie is bound into two options: either they escape, or they die up there. The choice the movie ultimately makes, and its execution, is the primary weakness in an otherwise good horror film.",1243900800,,1643,5.033088235294118

I went into the film with low expectations, and the film merely confirmed those expectations.  Acting is average, and effects are OK for those who don't lose interest after the first half hour.

3108680,4,B0013FZUQA,"If drug cartels and the Swine Flu haven't persuaded you not to visit Mexico, maybe watching ""The Ruins"" will.  This nifty horror flick is simple but very disturbing.  It has great acting from a young, attractive cast; great direction from Carter B. Smith; and is based on the best-selling novel by Scott Smith.  ""The Ruins"" is a must see for fans of creature features.

  On their last day of Spring break, a group of college friends visit an ancient Mayan pyramid.  The local, gun-toting natives are angry and keep them imprisoned there.  Meanwhile, the friends begin suffering accidents while exploring the temple in search of two tourists who went missing the day before.  As the heat increases and the food and water run out, tension and fear mount among the survivors.  Their tempers flare.  One by one they begin falling prey to a creature unlike any seen on this planet.  Using its special powers, it implants paranoia within their minds, forcing them to the edge of the pyramid, to the edge of insanity and to the horrible death that awaits them all.

  ""The Ruins"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy sun drenched, outdoor science fiction horror movies involving bizarre creatures.  This film should serve as a warning to all.  Don't visit ruins that are not on the local tour maps.  Even the birds and mammals won't go near the ruins in this film.  It is best to watch ""The Ruins"" as a double feature along with ""Turistas.""

Well, ok, they are good looking white kids in a foreign country, but they're not jerks and I can honestly say that they do not deserve what happens to them in this film.
The Ruins is actually based on a quite popular book that I never heard of until after I saw the movie. From what I hear, it's a fairly accurate adaptation (it should be, the same author wrote the book and screen play). Since I never read the book, this mini review will be based on the movie only. Bottom line, I really liked it.
2 couples are vacationing in Mexico (I think Cancun). They meet some other people and become friendly. They go on a hike to an uncharted Mayan ruin. Up until that point, it's a fairly enjoyable teen movie like any others....drinking, sex, a little nudity (wish there was more of that!). When they reach the ruins though, the s*** hits the fan....HARD CORE. Without spoiling too much, let's just say that the friends can't leave the ruins now. This is where the movie becomes a sort of Cabin Fever type movie, where they are all trapped and forced to deal with something they never thought possible. What elevates this movie from others like it is the acting and smart writing. I won't say who dies, who lives, or anything like that, but I honestly cared about the characters here and didn't want any of them to suffer the fate that many/some/all/none (heehee) received. I actually found it sad when something bad would happen to one of them. Normally, when I'm watching Hostel or Saw types, I just want to see how the next person dies.... Here I was actively hoping none of them would.
This is labeled a horror film, but it's not really scary. It's got more than its fair share of ""make you squirm"" moments, and it definitely can fill you with the ""what the F now"" kind of tension. But it's not a cheap scare movie. I guess it's more of a Misery type horror movie.
I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Hostel/Turistas type movies, but wants something that steps it up in the story and acting department. It's certainly way better than what the Saw series has become. There is one thing in the movie that I can see some people not going for...again, I don't want to spoil the plot, but it's one of those things that you either go with it, or you don't. I went with it, and I had a great time with the movie.

They find this jungle that they KNOW better not to come to, and even worse, find an ancient ruin hidden in the middle of it. Surprised, and stoked, they decide that they want to take a closer look.

But that's not always the smart thing to do. Foreigners surround them and even kill one of their friends. They have no choice but to climb the ruin which later you learn, is bound by these moving, and seem-ably breathing plants.

It's a strange movie indeed, and some happenings ""ruin"" the movie, but I think overall, it's worth at least one watch.

The plot was a little flimsy (where did those particular plants come from? what made them act like that?), but they did stick to it pretty well, I think. And the effects were top-notch. But after watching it the one time, I haven't wanted to see it again, and one of the ways I know if I like a horror movie is if it leaves me wanting to watch it over to get all the nuances. This one just didn't to that. It was a one-time thing.

3108684,1,B0013FZUQA,"It's weird to begin a review of a movie by talking about a book, but The Ruins by Scott Smith could have been a triumph in the horror genre. But, as I stated in my review of the book, the ending is just plain awful.

Like the movie, we watch (or read about) this group as they struggle to survive against Mayan protecting themselves and the creepy plant. However in the book, all of their struggles, their small triumphs, their will to survive is absolutely pointless since not a one of them survive the ordeal. They're destined to become a pile of bones just like all the folks who have come before them. Of course this begs the question of why the author gives us their story. Since the tale for any victim of the plants ends exactly the same, why bother telling us the tale of THIS group?

Well, the movie fixed this major flaw in the book only to reverse it on the DVD. I watched the DVD with its alternate ending only to have my hopes dashed as the movie became as pointless as the book. Then, heading over to the special features, I find the theatrical ending which is 1000% better! Better than the alternate ending and the novel's.

An option would have been nice to watch the theatrical release with the proper ending but, no, they had to give us the ""special"" ending not scene in theaters. And, for that, I give the movie 1 star.

What also would have helped the movie would be to add an actual fight between the plants and humans. The group seemed content to sit and wait for the end while waiting for help. All I can say is that if I was stuck on a hill with deadly plants all around me, the damn thing would have a lot of regrowing to do after it got me. I wouldn't sit around while the ""talking"" plants mocked me. This was another flaw in the book, albeit a minor one, and I was sorry to see it carry over to the movie.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the theatrical version of the film and, if it's available on DVD (without the crappy ending), The Ruins is a horror film I'd happily add to my collection. As it stands now, I'm done with the DVD like I'm done with the book.

If you like movies where the protagonists are doomed right from the start and absolutely nothing they do to survive means anything in the end, then The Ruins is for you. If not, then don't waste you time on what could have been a great film.",1239321600,3,2334,4.221973094170403

This is a standard spooky ""eat them sexy dump girls"" movie. So why not at least three stars for a mediocre display of blood and gore? Because there is no effort to mask the story or add, any depth to this ridicules premise.

The added German accent was a nice touch and sticking close to the book helped but this is one novel that just does not morph well to a movie.

This film of course is a good candidate for Blu-ray as it has great color, detail, and sound. Too bad, it is wasted on a movie that is a cheap knockoff of people that need to be eaten.

3108686,3,B0013FZUQA,"I'll admit that when I first saw the trailer for ""The Ruins"" in theaters, I was pretty interested in seeing it.  Once in finally came out, however, I decided that it looked more like a DVD rental.  In my opinion, I was correct.

The film begins with a young lady in a dark room crying for help.  As usual, she can't get a signal on her cellphone and she is eventually pulled into the darkness screaming all the way.  From there, the film introduces us to four of the primary players in the film.  Amy (Jena Malone), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) are on the last leg of their vacation in Mexico.  They end up meeting and befriending Mathias (Joe Anderson), a fellow traveller who's looking for someone to join him on an excursion to find his brother who happens to be working on a dig at a mysterious Mayan pyramid.

Despite Amy's resistance, the group (including another traveller, Dmitri) head off to look for Mathias' brother.  What they find is a hesitant taxi driver who only agrees to drive them for most of their journey after being given a heavy tip.  When the driver goes as far as he feels safe enough to travel, he drops them off in the jungle.  The group hoofs it to the pyramid and quickly find themselves surrounded by a jumpy group of natives who are packing pistols, bows and arrows.

Despite trying to tell the natives why they are there, the group is shot at and forced up to the top of the pyramid for reasons I don't want to reveal (and aren't clear until later in the film).  At this point, the story becomes a tale of survival and emotional anguish, both of which are fueled by the unique enemy that awaits them in the pyramid.

This film is based on a novel of the same name by Scott Smith.  Having not read that book, I cannot honestly say how closely the film follows the original story.

What I can tell you is that this movie manages to give the viewer a relatively decent group of heroes to pull for.  This is a nice twist for horror films that feature young college-aged characters.  Most of the time, I'm happy to watch the bad guys off characters since most of them are unlikeable in the first place.  While one character does receive enough attention to make it rather easy to determine who survives, there's a genuine sorrow in seeing some of the characters meet their demise in this film.

The film isn't all that scary, but does offer up a nice helping of gore.  The CGI is a bit heavy in certain parts of the film, making it a hard to accept what is happening on the screen.  There's also a brief bit of nudity and some suggestive content, but nothing as excessive as most films in this genre contain.

Overall, the film shoots itself in the foot by having all of the action limited to one area.  While this works well in other films, the enemy in this film's limited range hinders the story's overall pacing.  I can easily see how this would work much better in book form, where character and creature development can be fleshed out, but the constraints of film keep this movie from being anything more than a three star flick.

Recommended to fans of gore, creature features and films that feature a decent bit of suspense.  I wouldn't necessarily call this film a keeper, but it is worth at least a couple of viewings.",1237939200,2,3296,4.431893687707642

However, they persist and he drops them off.  Little do these kids realize what's in store for them.

The pyramid is covered in vines that have a taste for human flesh.  Here is where the movie gets really stupid.  A bunch of local natives surround the pyramid and threaten our heroes with violence should they try to leave.  One of the group descends into the pyramid, becomes injured and ultimately becomes fodder for the hungry vines.  I'll only mention in passing the crude attempt to amputate his legs (after which the pieces are carted off by the vines).

What these geniouses failed to learn was that the natives surriounding the pyramid were deathly afraid of the vines.  At one point a chunk of vine lands in their direction and the one guy freaks out over it.  The unofficial leader of the kids, the medical student, failed to come up with a way to use the vines to their advantage.  If they had only thrown vine chunks at the natives, or found another way to scare the native off.  But no, these college kids were too dumb to make this connection.

So ultimately only one kid escapes, a girl who was able to start up an abandoned truck then cruise through the jungle with shooting natives in hot pursuit.  The movie ends with two new explorers happily entering the scene, presumably to face a similar ordeal.

3108702,4,B0013FZUQA,"""The Ruins"" kept me sitting on the edge of my seat, and anticipating what would happen next.  No other horror movie, except ""The Descent"" held my interest like this one.  I must admit, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is.  The hopelessness of the situation and ending ran along the same lines in both movies. If you don't think plants can be things of terror, this movie might change your mind. There are other horrors, as well, and they are very real.  As with ""The Descent"", I didn't especially like the ending here, but the actors played their characters well.  One of the best horror movies I've seen.",1231027200,,614,4.446428571428571

This film has some pretty graphic gore and they don't pull any punches! Some of this was laugh out loud funny as it's so over the top, I had to wonder who thinks of the stuff! :-D  It's fairly well acted and the tension is there, but it has a rather abrupt ending and I felt it left a few questions unanswered.

3108704,2,B0013FZUQA,"Having read Scott Smith's book, ""The Ruins"" at least three times and listening to the audio CD as well, I was very disappointed with the movie version.  The movie was  loosely based on his wonderful and highly entertaining novel.  I implore anyone who only saw the movie to do yourself a huge favor and read the novel. There were some engaging moments in the movie but they were few and far between. Rarely have I seen a movie veer so far away from the main story line of a novel. Perhaps ""The Ruins"" should have been a TV mini-series instead so that there would be adequate time for much needed character development.  May there NOT be a movie sequel.

3108705,5,B0013FZUQA,"I thought this was one REALLY scary movie.  Actually maybe not scary- more like disturbing.

Disturbing because the amount of blood was very high, and it just kept getting bloodier as the story went on.

These mysteriously EVIL weeds are the monster of the movie, so to speak.  They are especially drawn to blood, so whenever one of the teens started bleeding either from a big fall or got cut or whatever, the weeds would sense this and slowly sneak forward and attack without the teens knowing about it.

I admit I thought it was stupid how the plants apparently had an ability to mimic the sounds the teens would make, or the sound of a phone ringing.  I could have sworn the plants were giggling at one point.  Very silly.

But the story that involved WHY the kids weren't allowed to leave this mysterious place covered with weeds kept my interest, and I was wondering why the people who wouldn't let the teens leave were camping out and waiting for them to die.

Well, now we know why- they didn't want the teenagers to leave and possibly risk spreading the weed (which is silly, because there was one scene that showed a bird flying by, and as you probably know, a bird can simply carry leaves and seeds somewhere else, effectively spreading the weed- but we'll ignore that little mistake from the writers).

Anyway, I loved the movie, and the scenes where the weeds were actually crawling INSIDE the people and moving around inside their stomachs and legs like snakes was disturbing to me.  They looked like snakes moving around in peoples bodies!  I felt so sorry for that one blonde-haired girl and all the stuff she had to put up with.

3108706,3,B0013FZUQA,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  I loved the book by Scott Smith and found it ingenious with a clever evil source and slowly mounting terror and suspense.  It's no secret that the plants on the ruins are the evil presence.  Does it work in the film?  No, not really but the film is still better than a lot of the tepid horror films released.  So I had to give it 3 stars if only to give credit to the stars who give their all to try to make this film work.

I have honestly never seen such a bad adaption from novel to film though.  All character development is lost.  The film follows some parts of the book with 100% accuracy and totally skips others.  Without having read the book the film will make little sense.  With today's modern technology the vines and blossoms that possess such evil look very fake and plastic.  In the novel the happenings on the ruins and the reason the natives were not letting them get away was slowly revealed.  The plants power supplied much terror as its capabilities sunk into the minds of the characters.  It makes no sense in the film that these people would so easily accept the powers of the plants.

The book showed how the four characters tried to survive physically and mentally  and succeeded greatly as a survival film.  Here when alcohol is needed for an impromptu surgery it magically appears.  Who had it and where did it come from?  Throughout the film the actions of the people makes no real sense.  We have no understanding of their motivation.  This film could have been much better if treated as a psychological drama with terror combined and allowed character development and put more effort into making the plant believable and realistic.  Instead the movie takes the goriest parts from the book and utilizes them for simple horror effect.  Big mistake is all props look fake.  Body parts when being tortured etc. all look fake.

When watching a horror film one expects to suspend disbelief and go on a journey of terror and suspense.  That is with a high quality horror film.  This film is a basic B Movie and wastes the opportunity to have been a very good film.

See this film with little expectation and rent it.  Not worth buying.",1229126400,,2197,4.521628498727735
3108707,1,B0013FZUQA,"Where to start, first of all, you should avoid any horror movies that start off with college coeds on a beach in a foreign country, it's a bad omen.  Second, if you plan to make a horror movie centered around a creature you should make the creature more visible.  Third, you should not rely on gore ALONE to make people take notice of your film.
I almost think they should have named this movie ""Hostel 3"" because the only thing that would pull your attention towards it is the gore that is shown.  The plot is as follows: 4 teenagers and a german back-packer decide to visit a ruin and get stuck there while a plant slowly turns them into gardens.  The creature of film is nothing more than a pile of vines with flowers that slowly infests someone's body or drags them off, albeit slowly.  Nothing in the movie was scary in the slightest, and considering I didn't flinch during Hostel I was not too impressed with this movie either.
I actually see this movie as more of a comedy with gore rather than a horror film, I laughed at a lot of what was said and the ridiculous actions that took place.  The first of which occurs near the beginning when the german falls from the sling that was lowering him into the temple, the med student, without batting an eye quickly says to the girls, ""One of you has to go"".  Why doesn't either of the men go?  Because they need to man the crank.  There also appears to be a hand job going on, or at least something sexual, during the most inappropriate time.  The worst part is that when everything possible goes wrong, including a death, vines coming to life, vines coming to life then killing and dragging away a corpse, and a short supply of food and water, the group STILL decides to ""hang tight"" and wait for rescue, meanwhile being surrounded by said killer plant.
This movie doesn't bring anything new to the horror genre, in fact, it probably brings my view of modern horror movies down a few notches.  It wasn't scary, it wasn't gross, it was a waste of time.  It follows the basic formula of kids getting stranded, cell phones having no service, and slowly being killed one by one.  Despite the bad reviews I wanted to see this movie to see a killer plant, but even that was a let down because it looked like anything you would see anywhere in the woods.  If you want to go see another Hostel by all means see this movie, and if you were scared by this, then you're pathetic.",1225497600,2,2421,4.375

By the pool they meet a German named Mathius, who says his brother Heinrich is missing and he's going to go look for him near some ruins.  Mathius talks the couples into going with him.  Heinrich left a map showing the location of the ruins, far off the tourist area of the Yucatan.

The next day the couples and Mathius set out, accompanied by Demitri, a Greek friend who doesn't speak English.  After a bus, a taxi, and a hike through the jungle, they discover the ancient site.  The ruins rise above the jungle floor, magnificent, and covered in blooming vines.  Mayans race out of the jungle, shouting warnings in a language the tourists don't understand ... until Dimitri is shot for stepping into the vines.  The Mayans chase the tourists onto the ruins and surround them, threatening to kill anyone who attempts to leave the cursed place.  Now they are trapped, and must struggle to survive.

There's so much more that happens in the movie but you must watch it to find out what.  The book by Scott Smith was fantastic, and since Smith also wrote the screenplay the story stays true to the book (except for a surprise altered ending).  The movie has some very decent gore in it; gory cuttings, grisly amputations, and of course, a flesh-hungry vine.  A fantastic enemy and a hopeless situation, along with gruesomely bloody scenes, save this movie from being just another typical ""slice and dice"" film.

Ruins doesn't make any secret of its pretty absurd 'monster', but the film is smart enough not to take the concept to laughable extremes. When gore befalls our travelers it's mostly self-inflicted, and the tension comes not from the usual chase but from the increasingly dire situation and the character's utter inability to escape it.

Ruins is like 'Cabin Fever' with weeds instead of viruses and the pacing follows the typical slasher pic to a tee. It doesn't get points for originality, but the cast features some familiar (if hard to place) faces, all veteran B film or bit role actors who know their stuff. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, but I'd grab it from the bargain bin in a heartbeat.

3108723,3,B0013FZUQA,"Four young, attractive Americans are in Mexico for a few days of Spring Break-like laying around and drinking.  They meet a young, attractive German guy who encourages them to go with him to visit a Mayan ruin that is off the tourist radar.  You see, his brother, an archeologist, has gone there with his girlfriend...otherwise they'd have the place to themselves.  The Americans, in a nod towards soaking up some history & culture, accompany their new friend to the ruin, which is nothing more than a modest sized Mayan pyramid, fairly well covered in some sort of vine with red flowers.  Along the way, they pick up a young Greek man, also on his way to the ruin.

They arrive and are suddenly surrounded by some natives, who speak Mayan, not Spanish, and their threatening gestures drive the 6 tourists up the pyramid and into the foliage.  This, based on the reaction of the natives, is REALLY BAD.  In fact, after touching a plant, the Greek man tries to leave, and is promptly killed by the natives.  So our remaining ""heroes"" find they are kinda stuck at the top of the pyramid.  Cell phones don't get signals, the natives are vigilant and vicious and there is no sign of the German archeologist and his girlfriend.

This is the setup for the laughable yet somehow insidiously creepy THE RUINS.  I've never read the book, so cannot judge it's faithfulness to the source material.  I can't imagine it's all that important.

As you might guess (or seen from the trailers), all is not well at this pyramid.  The seemingly harmless vines actually have fairly malevolent powers, and the 5 tourists have a pretty miserable, scary time of it.

I hesitate to tell you more of the plot.  This film isn't terrifically gory, nor are the effects even terribly convincing.  But as time wears on and the humans become more desperate to escape...the movie begins to become effective despite itself.  There is just something inherently creepy in what happens.  The idea of things literally getting under your skin is just a little too cringe-worthy to simply be laughed off.

It's a very simple, direct story that could have been readily told in 20 minutes less time...but the writers REALLY stretched to get us to 90 minutes.  The opening 15 minutes or so establishes the dynamics between the lead characters, and this portion is DEADLY dull.  We know it's obligatory...but I couldn't help thinking about the far superior THE DESCENT, which took about 6 minutes to establish its characters.  Yes, it did it in a fairly clich&eacute;d manner, but at least it got it over with in a hurry.  THE RUINS seems to take forever to get going.

The acting is spotty too.  Best known, and least successful is Jena Malone, who seems like the person you'd least want to take on spring break with you.  Whiny and high-maintenance...she does little to win our sympathy, particularly when she gets drunk and we see how poorly she behaves with her inhibitions down..  Far better is relative unknown Laura Ramsey, who endures some of the greatest hardships and is most successful at translating her fear right to the audience. Jonathan Tucker (""The Black Donnellys"") is okay as Malone's boyfriend...he is at least suitably annoyed at her through most of the film.  Joe Anderson (ACROSS THE UNIVERSE) is Mathias, their new German friend, and he lays on a thick accent, a little more that is very convincing.

But we all know we watch these kinds of movies for the thrills and chills.  I wouldn't say it delivers many thrills, but there are a decent number of chills, if you have the patience to wait for them.

I am literally completely on the fence about recommending this movie.  If you like the kind of film I've described, check it out.  If you normally shy from the genre...this is NOT the film to change your mind.",1222646400,2,3793,4.722983257229832

By isolating the story in one small geographic area (really, just one ""ruin""), writer Scott Smith increases the despair of his characters, but also limits where the narrative can go.  The main antagonist lacks the sinister, deliberate quality that it had in the book, making it seem somewhat more incidental than the secondary antagonist(s).  Without giving too much away, Smith never explains the theory of ""why"" they are trapped, as in the book, so it feels less satisfying.  Ultimately, it gets the Hollywood treatment, with a different ending, the omission of a crucial character (his lines/actions are given to other members of an already large protagonistic cast), and a final feeling of ""that's it?"".",1221177600,3,843,5.079710144927536

3108736,1,B0013FZUQA,"The Ruins (Carter Smith, 2008)

Scott Smith's novel The Ruins was either a love-it-or-hate-it book, so when the film version was released, I kind of half-assumed that the people who were reviewing it all came down on the ""hate"" side where the book was concerned. For some odd reason, despite my extensive experience watching really bad film adaptations of novels, it simply never occurred to me that Smith, who adapted his own novel, would make so many absurd changes to the book when writing the screenplay. But, oh, for the love of Pete, what changes he hath wrought. And not a single one of them does anything other than take a very interesting novel that focused on the psychological states of the people trapped at the ruins and make it into a stupid hungry-plant movie.

The plot: four friends-- Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Stacy )Laura Ramsey), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore)-- are on vacation in South America. They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), who's going into the jungle tomorrow to look for his brother, who went out to some ruins with a cute archaeologist he met, and hasn't been back since. The four friends decide to head out there with Mathias (sans the Greeks, for those of you who read the novel) and run into some very unfriendly Mayans who, once they're on the ruins, won't let them off again. You find out why pretty quickly (again unlike the novel).

Very little effort is expended on the characters' psychological states, which is the aspect that made the book worth reading. Also, to confuse people I guess, Smith rewrote who was doing what (and who died when-- I guess if you leave the Greeks in town, everything has to change, huh?) so that there will be quite a few cognitively dissonant moments for those who have recently read the novel. And the ending-- oh jeez. Could it possibly be any dumber? At least the ending in the book made a shred of sense. Then, of course, there's the big revelation about the plant. In the book, Smith managed to turn it into a major subplot. Here, it appears as a teaser, then gets pulled out for show, and... disappears. Oh, the humanity (or florality, I guess).

3108740,4,B0013FZUQA,"I just watched the unrated version of The Ruins and liked it. Let me explain why I think you will too:

1) The acting and dialog were quite good....better than the screeching, amateurish, idiotic performances generally passed off as ""acting"" in similar movies. The characters behave as rational, reasonably intelligent young people and their comments and actions are both practical and appropriate. They do not go for midnight swims in haunted swamps; they do not enter darkened rooms looking for axe-wielding maniacs; instead they react like we would to the serious threats they encounter. As a result, we connect with them. This makes the horror of their predicament more involving and convincing. When people we like are threatened and killed, the experience becomes far more personal.

2) The special effects are convincing, relying on realistic prosthetics that are mutilated before our eyes...with no camera or CGI trickery. In addition, virtually all the horror scenes take place in broad daylight and in close-up. One of the greatest weaknesses of many horror movies is that the action occurs in semi- or total darkness (i.e. A vs P Requiem). Whether inferior movies do this to mask the phoniness of the effects or as a misguided effort to make it all more scary, the actual result is confusion on the part of the audience. Truly scary things can happen in broad daylight....The Ruins proves it. This takes skill and artistry, talents missing from a lot of horror movies.

3) No horror movie can rise above the quality of its ""villain"". Unfortunately, the truly classic ""monsters"" from previous great horror films (Jason, Mike Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc.) have been done and redone to the point of becoming a cliche....the source of parodies like Scream, Scary Movie, and (my personal favorite) Behind the Mask. In The Ruins, the ""monster"" is an entity which we take for granted, not realizing the startling and original powers it possesses. Hitchcock used birds, normally so familiar and nonthreatening, to terrorize audiences. Now, in The Ruins, another seemingly familiar and harmless organism comes forth to do the same. Whether or not the book (from which the movie came) does a better job in this regard is irrelevant. Imagination has an artistry that no camera can match, but in my opinion this movie comes close.

4) The photography and direction are far better than other movies of this (and other) genres. No supposedly artistic fluttery, nauseating hand-held camera work. You are given a clear view of everything that happens and allowed to judge each scene and event for yourself. Also, I was aware of no manipulation by jarring music, often a cheap way to startle and shock. Again, this subtlety requires artistry, and a respect for the audience that has become (unfortunately) so rare.

In conclusion, watch the movie and judge for yourself. Compare it to other such offering currently and recently on the market. I feel confident you will agree that The Ruins is a ""cut above"" (pun intended).",1218758400,,3015,5.046184738955823

The changes from the original novel were done with excellent care & finesse that detracted very little from the story, but I found crucial to a visual medium and assisted the viewer in relating to the personal horrors and pshycological terror of the characters. The story moves at a great pace that kept me engrossed from beginning to end with a escalating gut tightening tension, erosion of hope and sanity, as well as reality altering horrors. Excellent directing, special effects, editing, and site coordination as well as great casting with exceptional performances from these talented actresses and actors have made this one of the best horror films I've seen in quite some time. I have seen literally hundreds of horror and sci-movies over the years and can say honestly & gladly that this film is powerful and unforgettable. Not only does it contain one of the most unique storylines to come out of a seemingly stagnant Hollywood's ""Let's make another classic horror remake"" in years, but on every front grabs the viewer and doesn't let go until the bitter end.

3108756,3,B0013FZUQA,"When I read the book I thought it would make a good film, and it did.  The basic plot is that some young, rather naive people visit an out of the way archeological dig and are forced to stay on a Mayan pyramid by some locals.  The suspense, at first, is to discover the reason these locals are willing to kill anyone who steps off the pyramid.  It turns out that they are essentially in quarantine, with the Mayans basically protecting the world from a dreadful ivy escaping.  Yes, an ivy.  Pretty flowers.  This plant is, as it turns out, evil and takes over anyone it touches, infesting them, killing them.  In the book, there was the sense that the plant was intelligent.  In the film, it is just extremely invasive (kadzu gone bad), though it does have the ability to imitate sounds.

Can this end happily?  Not likely!  The worse thing is that it is pretty grizzly to watch.  The thing that really saves this movie is that the folks who made it are actually very talented.  The acting was excellent/ the directing was well done / the music was perfect / the entire ""realization,"" set design was very, very good.  So, for what is basically a pretty thin story turned out to be worthwhile.

That the screenplay is also written by the book's author may explain why this book-to-movie translation doesn't have the chopped up feel many adaptations do but in a plot this thin, I'm not sure that's saying much. Also, the acting is better than I expected and, at times, the cinematography was note worthy. But the film does have it's share of problems. The setup feels tired (a group of 20 somethings find unexpected danger on their exotic vacation), the characters lack any real depth and the scare-factor is a bit weak. The movie isn't overly gory but if people clawing/digging into their own body does more than make you squirm, this movie is best avoided. Personally, I would have preferred a deeper movie with a little more psychological terror and a bit more reason to care about the characters.

Soon enough, they're on the run from murderous Mayans, and on their way to becoming dinner.  Despite what could be seen as a ridiculous plot line, The Ruins manages to succeed thanks to a surprisingly well-orchestrated sense of dread and tension that escalates as the blood and gore mount.

3108761,5,B0013FZUQA,"A group of vacationers coming across a recently discovered ancient Mayan temple in the heart of the Mexican jungle is the basis for ""The Ruins"", in which long-dormant deadly plants are awakened and create the menace for what might turn out to be the best horror movie of the year.  Killer plants have been used periodically in horror movies, sometimes successfully (the demonically-possessed woods in ""The Evil Dead"", for example), but more often not.  What's more surprising than the success achieved in The Ruins is that the angle is played 'straight', with a seemingly non-supernatural origin and a level of believability that one probably wouldn't have predicted.

  A group of two young couples at a Mexican resort meets and becomes friends with a German archaeologist (or it may have been an anthropologist, I can't remember) who's planning to embark the next day on a trek into the jungle to meet up with his brother and the brother's research partner, who've uncovered some old ruins.  Looking to add something different to their vacation, the group joins up with their new friend and his guide and takes a jeep into the wild.  At this point, no one in the party has any reason to suspect that the ruins are anything more than what they seem to be - an interesting find of ancient buildings out in the jungle.  Upon arriving at their destination though, things soon change.

  Once inside the clearing, they're surrounded by jungle-dwelling locals who seem terrified of the temple but who refuse to allow them to leave the clearing once they've entered it.  Upon making their way into the ruins in search of the pair who was supposed to already be on-site but appear absent, the real horror begins.  Something deep under the surface has awakened and is getting stronger after centuries of dormancy.  The things this movie does with the plants and the ruins are just too good to give away in a write-up; suffice it to say that there are some freaky, seriously frightening things going on.  Innovative, gorgeously photographed and emotionally powerful, with some cool sexy parts and occasional, highly effective moments of viciously gory carnage, it's a shame that this movie seemed to fly under a lot of people's radar.  It's unquestionably one of 2008's best, and one of the year's best ensemble casts to boot.  A definate horror must-see.",1217376000,,2347,4.9012658227848105

3108773,3,B0013FZUQA,"Scientists have theorized that there are certain extinct plant life that can possibly induce partial mind control through their spores. They can cause anxiety, paranoia and fear to protect themselves from predators. Fossils have been found to support these theories and some plant life are even believed to be meat eaters and is capable of attracting prey. One plant that still exists today is the ""Venus Flytrap"" which is a predatory plant, so what do you think the possibilities are for a supposed extinct plant life to be able to prey on human beings?

THE RUINS is a film freely adapted from the novel by Scott Smith (Sam Raimi`s A Simple Plan), who is also responsible for this film's screenplay. Director Carter Smith is at the helm of this fright flick and he doesn't shy away from giving us a straight-forward monster film. Oh, yes, in some ways, ""The Ruins"" is a monster film but it also doesn't forget the horror of human nature.

Four college students (Shawn Ashmore, Jena Malone, Jonathan Tucker and Laura Ramsey) are on vacation in Mexico, a long week of margaritas and white sand beaches. When a German tourist (Joe Anderson) mentions a site where an ancient Mayan Temple stands, the foursome decides to get away from all the fun stuff and embark on a little adventure a day before they have to leave. Once the group arrives at their destination, they find that they are not welcomed by the local townsfolk and ends up being trapped on top of the temple. Little do they know that the angry locales and potential starvation are the least of their worries as the flowers and vines almost have a mind of their own--and they have a taste for human blood.

Murderous flowers. Sounds real campy doesn't it? Well, the movie has a lot of flaws from the get-go with a script full of clich, stereotypical characters, some nudity, the cast goes to secluded spot and nasty townsfolk traps them in a scary situation. The film does give off a lot of bad impressions that would cause us to roll our eyes immediately. The movie's set up is definitely unoriginal that it gave the impression that here's just another horror film that it doesn`t stand out. It would take some patience in order for one to at least see its good moments.

The film is more on cerebral torture and the sense of dread. Human nature is also displayed as embodied by the scared townsfolk that they would do anything to keep whatever it is they fear secluded and quarantined than to try to understand the problem. The way that the director displays the feeling of dread and mental torment is by having our protagonists knife their own flesh to keep the vines from invading their bodies. Yes, blood and gore is omnipresent as these group of young people even perform an amputation with a steak knife that shows the gory details.

The performance of its cast is a mixed bag. But Stacy (Laura Ramsey) does somewhat grab the spotlight as the only character who truly experiences the full assault by the killer plants; physical violation and paranoia is experienced head on by this girl. The film relies on displaying visual gore instead of the usual emotional hysteria. With its visuals, the blood and gore gives an uneasy feel, and they serve as the film's saving grace. The resulting self-inflicted despair and the panic from the vines is quite intense. It is rather frightening to have a `thing' invading your flesh to breed in your body. It also emphasizes the feeling of being trapped and underestimating nature itself. The scenes are reminiscent of the movie ""Cabin Fever"".

Unfortunately, after it achieves ""shock value"" through its sequences of human torment and the pain inflicted both psychologically and physically, the film becomes predictable again. The movie has already disconnected itself with its stereotypical characters and what makes it worse is its predictability near the climax. The proceedings had already displayed potential but it decided to go for the usual histrionics. The film should have also given more character development (ahem) to our ""green"" antagonist. The townsfolk seem to be a minor plot device to get everything going.

""The Ruins"" is not by any means a bad movie. The film did manage to generate a feeling of dread and emotional torment that kept me interested for the most part. It is a little better than fair but comes a little short of being `good'. It is a modest attempt to emulate raw human horror and a lot more decent than the recent Hollywood remakes that has plagued us of late. It did manage to generate a feeling of claustrophobia and panic but its formulaic approach just kills whatever it manages to bring into bear. ""The Ruins"" isn't a total ""ruin""; it's just rather uneven and forgettable.

Although quite faithful to the book (Smith also wrote the screenplay), the filmmakers seem more interested in seeing how graphic they can get with the leg amputations and self-mutilation scenes. There are a few good creepy moments, like when the girls discover that the cell phone ringing is something else entirely, but those moments are rare. The acting is good and the sets are impressive but the movie isn't scary, which is what the main premise of a horror film should be.",1216857600,3,628,4.718181818181818

Get The Descent and never buy this movie. You have been for warned.",1216857600,,496,4.221052631578948
3108776,3,B0013FZUQA,"The trailer for the Ruins grabbed my attention, with the combination of a Mayan temple in what appeared to be a ""Descent"" type setting.  Seeing how much I enjoyed the Descent and how clever and original of a horror film it was in recent years, I thought I would give this a try, little did I expect what this film really focused around.  While there is a Mayan temple and a bit of exploration inside its dark & creepy interior, most of the film actually takes place ""on top"" of the temple.

The Ruins begins with a group of teens on vacation (big surprsie) who meet up with another group of young guys who ask if they want to tag along to a site of an old Mayan temple.  Once there, the group if surrounded by angry natives who set up a kind of quarantine camp, and will not hesitate to shoot anyone who leaves the site.  The group is thus trapped and spends the remainder of the film figuring out how to survive and how to get help, all while slowly dying off one by one (just like any horror film).  Though I keep saying horror, the Ruins is hardly that.  While there were maybe two moments I jumped off my seat, for the most part (which is typical of horror films these days) the focus remainds on grisly scenes of gore.  Makeup was done well, and scenes a-plenty will make you squirm, if nothing else, an unforgettable scene of cuting off one's legs with a mere hunting knife.  Unfortunately, I couldn't take the wild plant too seriously, however, the damage it causes to its victims you can take seriously when you see the results.  The ending disapointed slightly, ending too abrupt and without much satisfying, but that too seems to be becoming more of a constant these days in the genre.

Overall I'd say this is worth checking out.  There is some originality, but not too much as the film seems to borrow ideas from already established horror films.  Though not truly scary in the classic horror sense, if you are into getting creeped out by intense gore, Ruins should safice, however, it is still mediocre compared to films like Saw, Hostel, or Inside.

Maybe I'm just not doing my homework, but it seems to me like, recently, writers/directors of ""scary"" movies have decided that what is really, truly scary is simply being scared.  In other words, forget the actual concept of horror, let's not go to the trouble of coming up with a creative and unsettling premise.  Let's just come up with a bad guy, toss him (or her, or it) some victims, and have the poor, doomed dopes get batted around for an hour and a half.

THE RUINS and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strangers/dp/B00005JPSB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strangers</a>&nbsp;are two remarkably different films in tone, pacing, style and substance, but at their core, they are both dismally, lamentably alike.  Both of them wholeheartedly believe that if they can scare the characters in their films, then that is the exact same thing as scaring the audience watching those characters.

THE RUINS will attract more viewers, but only because it's gorier.  It wears its blood on its sleeve, let's say.  Based on Scott Smith's flawed and overlong&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/0307389715/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>, the movie takes the only thing about the book that worked -- the character development -- and completely tosses that out the window.  What you're left with are six carbon copy twenty-somethings (yes! younger viewers, there IS gratuitous nudity, and boy, is it gratuitous!) who must fight against an insidious force that dwells among them!

I'm just kidding.  I lifted that last line from the book jacket.  They don't fight the insidious force.  They just fight each other.  Aside from some squeamish bits involving legs and the threat of sepsis, the only thing about the film that's supposed to be scary is the fact that the ""insidious force"" takes its sweet, sweet time killing the vacationers when, by all accounts, it could've obliterated them within minutes of their arrival.  But, see, that wouldn't be scary, would it?  Eschewing even the tiniest shred of plausibility that would make it endurable, THE RUINS artlessly banks on the concept that watching a cat toy with a mouse is a riveting, suspenseful and horrifying experience.  When, in fact, you eventually just yell at the cat to eat the poor thing already.

A young couple returns from a wedding to a summer home, only to be terrorized all night by three masked intruders.  Just like THE RUINS, the ending is forcasted from the opening credits.  Unlike Scott Smith's movie, however, THE STRANGERS's devious devilry makes a bit more sense, considering its source.  After all, humans are more likely to thrive off of the power-trip of terror than vines.  (Whoops.  I think I may have just given away the secret of THE RUINS.  Ha ha.  I'm just kidding.  THE RUINS has no secrets.)

Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman (or, as I like to call them,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aerosmith/dp/B000068QZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aerosmith</a>'s Daughter and That Guy From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Felicity/dp/B00005JLJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Felicity</a>) as our estranged and horrified young couple, do a pretty good job of making us feel their fear, but the movie still falls flat in the usual places.  Characters fail to believe anything odd is going on until it is Too Late.  The victims make the obligatory Dumbest Decision Ever (""Let's split up!"").  And, of course, just like THE RUINS, the movie is only as scary as the Bad Guys are deliberately and gratuitously trying to be.  (No, younger viewers, the ""gratuitous"" in this case does not involve nudity.)

I've always been a fan of scary movies because of the primal reaction that terror engenders in me (and in most people, I think).  In that sense, I can empathize with the poor, clueless cannon fodder that get chewed and abused in both of these films.  But empathy, as necessary as it may be for horror films, will only get you so far.  After all, I am entertained by fear only as long as I feel that fear.  I don't get my jollies watching other people get scared out of their wits.

But if you do?  Well, now you know what to watch.",1216771200,,4690,5.545070422535211

How do you make a horror story in broad daylight, atop a pyramid? This is how. It's claustrophobic and this is emphasised by the brilliant use of widescreen. For my money it plays more like a drama than a horror story but that's just fine since the film is populated by believable people with believable lines. I'm not sure about the premise of the plant life and the end is formulaic - no-one here gets out alive. You do get a choice of endings to sweeten things up a little.
It's hard not to root for the characters so to speak. It doesn't seem to have the mounting sense of hopelessness that The Descent did but it stands head and shoulders above The Happening. However, B Minus rather than B Plus but still very well worth a look.",1216339200,,970,4.455056179775281
3108781,2,B0013FZUQA,"Taking Spring Break in Mexico, four college kids hook up with a couple of European tourists and embark on a trek to an ancient pyramid in the interior jungle. A bus drops them in a small village where they try and hitch a ride with a Mexican man who rebuffs them, advising them to stay away from the ruins.  However, he quickly relents when they flash a twenty in front of him.  At the ruins, the young people are surrounded by an armed group of Mayans who, after killing one of the party, force the others to the top of the pyramid, where they spend the remainder of the movie being menaced by an intelligent, man-eating vine.

I didn't love the bestseller by Scott Smith, and, even with some significant changes, the movie doesn't improve upon the novel.  Director Carter Smith presents some nice views of the Mexican coastline, but does little to enliven his characters or generate much interest in their fates.  It doesn't help that the movie starts very slowly, and that the action is confined to a relatively small space.  Instead of playing on the character's paranoia and the audience's feeling of claustrophobia, Smith throws on gore and hysteria, which, oddly, makes the film seem flat and lifeless.  I don't have a problem with gore if it's necessary to advance the plot, but gore for gore's sake doesn't cut it--it's a cheap ploy, a last resort when creativity is limited.  When we see the gore here, it's just gratuitous; there is no real buildup of tension leading up to it, no suspense, and we don't really care about these characters because they're not close to believable. It's not necessarily the fault of the actors; the roles are seriously underwritten.  The book never really fleshed them out either, which, I think, interfered with its effectiveness.  As the film's nominal hero, Jonathan Tucker does his best in the role of a med student.  Tucker's actually quite a good actor, but he's wasted here.  Jena Malone, known for better performances, plays his girlfriend with a whininess that quickly becomes annoying, but when you have a part like this, one that doesn't offer much to begin with, you have to do what you can.  Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey, as the other college couple, are both photogenic and athletic, and their performances hint at the true talent that they'll hopefully be able to exhibit in future films.

I'm giving this film two stars because of the cinematography, and because, as bad as this film is, there are even worse (much worse) films out there that are truly deserving of a lower rating.",1216166400,2,2541,4.732426303854876
3108782,3,B0013FZUQA,"Premise: Two American couples on vacation in Central America meet up with a German backpacker and head out into the jungles to find the German's brother at a newly discovered Mayan ziggurat. Once there, they unintentionally step onto the vines growing on the ruins. The locals show up and refuse to let the travelers leave, quickly causing them to retreat to the top of the ruins where the bad events commence. The forced isolation causes the characters to become less rational. The ending is predictable but the alternate ending was better.

I have not read the book but have gathered enough info about it that some evidently important details were left out of the movie. Okay, for the movie: well shot, some beautiful scenes, moderate amount of tension, scare factor was low for me, and the best performance is by Laura Ramsey. The ""bad guys"" are the unassuming plant life vines coating the ruins which is a bit disturbing. The performances are limited (especially Eric's {Shawn Ashmore}) and the characters are flat with the exception of the breakdown of Stacy (Ramsey). For the most part, the gore in the film is actually well done and the injuries are largely caused by the main characters rather than the vines which are basically reactionary like a venus flytrap... rather cool.

The Unrated DVD is well nothing special. Limited special features including the building of the set, art departments creation of the vines, effects on the blood & gore, and the commentary. Then there are three deleted scenes and two other endings, the 'alternate ending' that was ""never before seen"" is better but may not have worked well enough in theatres. Overall, The Ruins is worth watching but in a few weeks or months you will forget about this movie unless you're a big fan of it.",1215993600,,1775,4.8355263157894735

3108784,4,B0013FZUQA,"""The Ruins"" is a film adaptation of the popular Scott Smith novel of the same name.  Released in 2006, it was the author's follow-up to 1993's acclaimed ""A simple plan"".  As such, The Ruins came in with a lot of hype, and a few gushing reviews notably by Stephen King.  But despite the fact the book has sold a great amount of copies, it has also been victim of some lashing critical ire, especially here on Amazon, where there are countless extremely negative reviews of the book due to its pacing, supposedly annoying characters and length.  This movie adaptation attempts to mostly use the overarching concept of Smith's novel and deliver suspense in a tight, filler-free 95 minutes of running time.  For the most part, it succeeds.

The film follows the travelling exploits of 4 vacationing college students who are in Mexico on an all-inclusive resort for some much needed rest, relaxation, and some partying thrown in for good measure.  Times are good, and with only 2 days left of vacation time, they meet a young German traveller by the pool who tells them about a Ruin temple, off the beaten path that is supposedly tourist-free and would make a great one-day trip.  The 4 take him up on the offer and despite the warnings of a couple of locals who say it's ""bad place"", they hire a villager to drop them off into the remote spot.  Once they get there however they soon discover that there is a very good reason why these Ruins are so isolated and off the beaten path.  Let the horror begin...

I found ""The Ruins"" to be an extremely effective horror film and somewhat unique within the horror genre.  Of course, the ""young people vacationing in a remote spot"" has been done tireless amounts of times but the approach is somewhat different here.  Instead of the travellers enjoying their spot and slowly realizing something is wrong, terror escalates from the first minute they are there.  From then on it never really lets up.  Also, this film is quite unique in the sense that the horror and physical violence is all self-inflicted.  It begs to ask the question:  What is more horrifying than having someone slash you with a knife?  Answer: Having to slash yourself with a knife!  Slowly, methodically and deep into the wounds.

There were unbelievable scenes of gore in the unrated version that I watched.  Me and my 2 brothers are both horror vets and somewhat immune to on-screen violence but there were several scenes here that had us cringing and that we found difficult to watch.  I haven't read the novel this was based on so can't really compare the two but I can safely say that the movie suffers from none of the pacing issues and overwhelming amount of character development that the book supposedly suffers from.

3108802,3,B0013FZUQA,"How could you discribe a movie like ""The Ruins""? Easy, get some ditzy collage kids looking for fun in ancient Mexican ruins, get stranded, and killed by plants.

 ""The Ruins"" spawned from its' 05 book brother named as such. You know how some of your favorite books marinate in time to change into something even better? Well, Ruins comes to dissapoint. It suffers from the 'poor directon' syndrom. Not saying that Ruins is bad, but some scenes felt drawn out, or just plain silly, such as the plants I've mentioned earlier. Mabey some ideas sound better on paper(or in a book, but thats kinda the same thing), I dunno, but seeing one of the protagonists cut herself because a flower told her to just seems a little abstract.

actual people would, which is all I ask for out of any movie. There
were only a few exceptions:

--When Jeff chased Amy down the temple as she tried to go for help,
he's sitting there trying to reason with her, pleading for her to come
back up so she doesn't get shot. Unrealistic. If that's your loved one
doing that, you YANK and physically snatch that person and drag them back up the temple.

--Same thing with the other guy and his girlfriend. When they came out
of the tent and saw the girl with the knife cutting herself, you don't
try to reason with someone who's obviously irrational and not in their
right mind. You don't slowly walk towards them casually, only to be
stabbed, you walk CAUTIOUSLY towards them, then get in position to
tackle her, and restrain her knife wielding arm. They both
approached facing her back side, so they had plenty of opportunity to
perform to subdue her without drawing aggro.

--I thought this had very good acting in it, surprisingly, even by the
girls. I haven't seen much of Jena Malone, but at least here she did a
great acting job, which makes her all the more hotter to me. Usually in
a horror movie I'm wishing for maximum pain to be inflicted in the
shortest amount of time to the beautiful, non-acting, bimbo sluts in

3342872,2,B0013FZUQA,"There's something to be said for sitting in an empty movie theater. The day I saw ""The Ruins""--a film adaptation of Scott Smith's novel--there was exactly one other person in the theater with me; he sat at the opposite end, and he made not a single noise, although he was eating popcorn one handful at a time. I have to treasure moments like this because, for the first time in ages, I watched a horror film without being distracted by inappropriate laughter and idiotic teenagers that scream just for the sake of screaming. Not that there's much to scream about in the case of ""The Ruins,"" a film with a plot so serious that it's paradoxically laughable. What we have here is a rare case: a movie too awful to be enjoyed and not awful enough to be campy good fun. It exists in a dull, derivative gray area somewhere between the two, so there's nothing much to get out of it other than ninety minutes away from home. No wonder there was only two of us in the theater.

The film opens with a shot of a woman engulfed in darkness, frantically trying to use her cell phone as she screams for help. She's suddenly grabbed by something and pulled into a pitch-black corner of wherever she is. The tension is immediately interrupted by the start of the story proper--while vacationing somewhere in Mexico, college students Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Eric (Shawn Ashmore), and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) meet a German tourist named Mathias (Joe Anderson), and he tells them of an off-the-beaten-path Mayan temple just begging to be explored. They all decide it would be worth a look. I ask you: What part of this idea seems plausible? Who in their right mind would venture into remote jungles with a completely unknown person? I guess it doesn't matter that Mathias has drawn his own maps to the area, a place supposedly kept secret.

There's a good reason for this. They arrive at the temple the next day, only to be surrounded by a group of villagers so isolated they don't even speak Spanish; Jeff and his group unknowingly step onto a patch of vines that shrouds the entire temple, and from then on, none of them are allowed to leave the site. But why? What's so bad about a patch of vines? It's eventually revealed that the temple is covered with a species of man-eating plant; its vines can surround a body in a matter of minutes, and God forbid you should have an open wound for them to enter. The rest of the film shows the tourists falling victim to this plant, beginning when one of the characters enters the temple via an opening at the top. They enter, you see, because they hear a cell phone ring tone coming from deep within--Mathias believes it's coming from his brother's phone, since they found his jeep not too far from the temple.

But there are other things to worry about besides the plant. Faced with the possibility of starvation, dehydration, and infection, the main characters slowly lose their rational minds. Some, like Stacy, are more directly affected; I won't reveal why, but rest assured it has something to do with the plants. Others, like Jeff, show subtler sings; he angrily holds onto the hope that everyone will be rescued. ""Americans on vacation don't just disappear!"" he snaps, and do I really need to explain why that's a bunch of baloney? He occasionally tries to take charge, probably because he's the goody-goody med school student that seems to know what to do for every injury he comes across. One of the film's most unnecessary scenes involved the amputation of one of the character's legs, and I'll never understand how Jeff came to that decision. It didn't even make sense as a plot device, simply because this isn't a horror film that supports cringe-inducing gore.

The only affective moment of this movie is the revelation that the plants are able to mimic sounds, such as Stacy screaming. Close ups of the red flowers show them vibrating whenever they make a noise, and this is frightening, I guess, because it shows that the plant is intelligent. The thing is, even a B movie plant monster is too good for a film this weak, unoriginal, and insignificant. ""The Ruins"" aims to tell a story the quick and easy way, and we see this through more than the flimsy character development and rehashed plot--every sequence goes from one to the next with very little payoff. Everything just sort of happens, and we're never given the opportunity to savor the moment.

This is especially true of the ending, which has resolution but doesn't stay on it long enough to satisfy. You watch this movie knowing that the filmmakers made very little effort, even in terms of scaring the audience. It was all about being quick and minimalistic, which would have been admirable under different circumstances. And by the way, yes, I get that this is supposed to be an escapist horror film, the kind you're just supposed to enjoy and not analyze. But how much fun can it possibly be if only two people decide to see it? I considered walking up to the man with the popcorn and asking him why we were the only ones in the theater, but I thought better of it; based on the fact that he never gasped, never laughed, and never applauded, the answer to my question seemed obvious. ""The Ruins"" will be forgotten almost as quickly as it was introduced, forcing it to retreat into some dark, secluded vault. Much like the vines of a man-eating plant.",1207699200,9,5372,4.638655462184874
3342873,4,B0013FZUQA,"This was a good horror film, if you don't mind gore.  (Not my bag.)  I saw it in the theater and I spent several times looking at the floor while people screamed on the screen. That said, it was scary, suspenseful, acting was good, plot was good. I did NOT read the book, so this review is based solely on the movie content.

The movie begins with 4 American young couples, (age 25 ish?) partying on the beach in Mexico.  A German guy joins their partying and he tells the 4 that his brother is on an archeological dig with the brother's girlfriend at some remote, off-the-map ancient Mayan temple deep in the jungle.  The German guy is going down there tomorrow.  Would the 4 like to join him and his friend?  Since it is the 4's last day in Mexico, they agree (well, 3 of them agree, and 1 reluctantly goes).

So, the 6 embark on this adventure in the morning.  They travel by bus for awhile to an old town, then they find a cab to take them farther.  The German guy has a map and shows it to the cab driver.  The cab driver immediately says, ""This place no good.""  (HINT!), but, they encourage him with $20 US dollars and off they go.  They arrive where the road ends, and now they must hike deep into the jungle.  Still following the map, they finally arrive at a clearing and a huge Mayan temple, covered with ivy and beautiful red poppy-looking flowers. (But don't let this green stuff fool you.  It makes poison ivy look like a Peace Lilly!  And the pretty red poppies are NUTHIN like Dorothy found in the field in the Wizard of Oz!)  But, I'm getting ahead of myself.

In the clearing, they meet some not-so-friendly natives, who speak something other than Spanish.  (It was not Mexican Castillian either).  Anyway, the natives already know how treacherous this poison ivy stuff is, so once some of the 6 touch it, the natives get real restless, forcing 5 of the 6 up the side of the temple.  The natives will not let them leave, so they are stranded on the temple.  Things begin to happen as people get hurt and the vine begins to attack.  (It can wrap around skin and tighten until it cuts, then it crawls inside.--NASTY!) And, those pretty little flowers can emulate sounds, and talk inside your head. There is some pretty gory stuff here, so if you can't stand blood and open cuts (and worse), spare yourself the flick.  But, if you like that stuff, then go for it.

I am happy to report that I did not have nightmares last night.  I rated it 4 star because it did what it did well, regardless of my lack of tolerance for these kind of movies.",1207526400,3,2555,4.337552742616034
3342874,3,B0013FZUQA,"I have the book by Scott Smith, upon which this movie is based, but unfortunately I haven't had the time to read it yet.  After seeing the film, however, I do want to read the book because I often find that the book is, indeed, better than its celluloid counterpart.

  This time around Smith (who also wrote 'A Simple Plan') takes us deep into the Mexican jungle.  A group of four young people who are spending their time in Cancun around the pool and drinking until they look like morons, meet Mattias, a German tourist who plans to visit his brother at an archeological dig.  Jeff, a pre-med student and the most level-headed of the bunch, along with his girlfriend, Amy and couple Eric and Stacy, set off with Mattias and Dimitri, a Greek tourist, to spend a day exploring the uncharted Mayan pyramid.

  Once at the pyramid, however, things take a horrific turn almost immediately when Mayans show up with weapons and will not allow the group to leave the area.  Unable to communicate with the agitated natives, the group climbs to the dig site, unaware of the terror they are about to face.  Atop the pyramid the young people slowly begin to realize what a nightmarish situation they have stumbled into with no viable way out.  Smith takes a normally beautiful part of nature and turns it into a monster and I find that one of the best parts of the films.  The travellers are stunned when they find out they are becoming victims to...we'll, I won't spoil that part of the film for you.

  'The Ruins' is a decent horror flick but didn't give me the willies like 'The Descent' did (the last horror movie I thoroughly enjoyed).  The scenes inside the pyramid were creepy but nothing compared to the claustrophobic terror that I felt during 'The Descent'.  It is, though, a good film and worth watching.  You may want to wait and enjoy it on dvd.  Its worth a rental but you may not want to fork out 10 bucks to see it on the big screen.",1207440000,3,1940,4.472934472934473
3342875,4,B0013FZUQA,"I went into ""The Ruins"" not really having any idea what it was about. It just looked interesting from the previews. The basic premise is a group of American twenty-somethings are on vacation in Mexico and on their last day decide to go see these ancient ruins that are not part of the normal tourist attractions. Once they get there things start going wrong, then they get worse. The suspence is held thruout the movie. There is a major element of the story that you just have to accept and once you do you're all set to enjoy the movie.
 My fear was that ""The Ruins"" would be like ""Touristas"" or ""The Cave"", it is like neither of these. It's more like ""Hostel"" in that the people don't really do anything overly stupid to get them into the situation they are in.
 Those who have read the book have complained about the ending. I didn't think it was a bad ending at all. I haven't read the book, but the end shown makes sense and leaves the viewer basically knowing what is going  to happen next without it being shown.
 If the movie teaches you nothing, it teaches you that if you go on vacation bring along some Weed-B-Gone, you never know when it will come in handy!!!",1207353600,14,1171,4.3577981651376145
3342876,2,B0013FZUQA,"When a group of friends get together for a vacation in Mexico, the last thing they think is that they'll wind up dead. Jeff and Amy are a couple who may be on the verge of collapse. Jeff is in med school 2,000 miles away from his sweetheart, and the distance manifests itself with Amy making out with anyone and everyone who is willing. Amy's best friend Stacy is also on the trip with her boyfriend Eric. The foursome are partying at their Mexico resort when a German named Matthias mentions that he has directions to some Mayan ruins that are a little off the beaten path. Determined to get in a little culture with their tequila, Jeff convinces the others that it will be a good idea. It's not.

The moment they find the ruins, a group of Mayan natives come bearing shotguns and bows and arrows (how cliche) and force the group deeper into the ruins. Pretty soon after their arrival, Matthias and Stacy are injured trying to find a missing cell phone at the bottom of a well. Jeff realizes that the locals have no plans on letting them leave. And the group realizes that the ivy surrounding their location just might be alive--and out for blood.

I slept with the lights on and felt things crawling on me when I went to sleep. The movie was a disappointment after that. First of all, the ending is different, and not in a good way. It's pretty evident that we're being left open for a sequel and who really wants to see two movies about a man-eating plant? Not me. Secondly, the action came and went pretty quickly with no real direction. There was no buildup. No tense moments while you wondered what would happen. Nope. I pretty much knew they were going to die. And it's a shame. The book left the road open for a lot of opportunity, and none of it was taken with this movie. If you're in the mood for a lackluster thriller with a predictable and trite ending, go ahead and see The Ruins film. But if you want to be scared and wonder about the banality of human cruelty, go ahead and read the book.",1207353600,9,2240,4.723785166240409

Previously she has left me sitting alone in the movie theater during showings of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakes-on-a-Plane/dp/B000JBXHQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakes on a Plane</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Terror/dp/B000XASD1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Terror</a>,"" and I am pretty sure that there is some sort of third strike rule here that I need to stay clear of (for the record, she walked out of parts of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Passion-of-the-Christ/dp/B00028HBKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Passion of the Christ</a>"" too, but she went with her mother and I was the chauffer and therefore not on a date).  So I returned from seeing the opening showing of ""The Ruins"" this afternoon, and reported to her that yes, indeed, the scenes that she did not want to see and in the movie, so we was wise to stay eating popcorn in bed and watching episode after episode of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-60-on-the-Sunset-Strip/dp/B00005JPI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a>,"" because she would have fled the theater.  Then she asked how the movie was, and I told her in one concise sentence was happens at the end.  She frowned and said, ""So they ruined it.""

Down in Mexico on Yucatan peninsula a pair of American couples are nearing the end of their vacation.  We have Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), along with Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey).  They meet up Mathias (Joe Anderson) and his friend Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas).  Mathias is trying to track down his brother, who is working on an archeological dig in the area.  The idea of seeing an ancient Mayan ruin that is not some sort of tourist trap is intriguing so they find a local taxi pickup truck and head out into the jungle.  Once there they find the path to the ruin, but as soon as they touch the bottom step a group of Mayans show up brandishing guns and other weapons, demanding that the visitors keep going the direction they are going and not return.  Once atop the ruins, the group is trapped.  Then things get worse.

Reading the novel will tell you most of what happens in this movie, but in adapting his screenplay to the screen, Smith has decided to switch who things happen to in this version of the tale.  Maybe this is just to surprise his readers, and maybe it is because some of these people look better in their underwear than others.  I cannot say that these changes hurt the story, because they do not.  Trying to cut out pieces of an insidious vine invading your body or doing major surgery with a rock and a knife is always going to make me cringe, and I have to think many people will feel the same way.  The problem with most of the film is that why all of the choice parts of the novel remain, albeit somewhat recast, most of the connecting tissue has had to be excised to get this film in at 91 minutes.  That means that one of the key aspects of the novel, the fact that these people are trapped for several days in the hot sun with next to nothing for food and water, is fast forwarded through in the movie.  One of the things that made the novel effective was that you had a real sense for how these people were spending hours not doing anything but living in fear.  Then every time they actually tried doing something, it only tended to make things worse.  All of that is essentially lost in this movie, which is where we lose the first star.

It is the ending that costs ""The Ruins"" a second star.  Yes, Smith wrote the screenplay, so it would seem that the finger of blame should be pointed in his direction, but I have seen way too many alternative endings (and multiple alternative endings), so I am well aware that directors and studios do not care about how good a book or a script is, they only care about what the test results tell them to think.  Because this is the sort of ending that a test audience might like, but only because they did not read the book and they have no appreciation for what makes a great ending in a horror film.  What allows hyperbolic copywriters to claim that ""The Ruins"" is the greatest horror novel of the 21st century (good to know that it is all downhill for the next 92 years) is that the ending of the book drives home the final nail in the coffin.  When this movie gets to what is essentially the same final scene as the book, the context is all different because of one massively monumental and stupid change.  That final shot is now rendered superfluous.",1207267200,23,4956,5.026894865525672
3342878,4,B0013FZUQA,"I never read the novel, but The Ruins is a worthy horror film for those with a strong stomach. There are two really disturbing scenes that put Hostel to shame and the camera doesn't shy away. I can't imagine what they cut out for the Unrated DVD (which you know is coming), but it probably isn't much. The cast is good overall (especially Laura Ramsey in a chilling performance) and there were only a couple of times when I sat shaking my head at the stupid things they said or did. A couple of times is not bad when compared to most horror films, besides it comes with the territory.

My only gripe is that the ""creature"" isn't shown enough (much like Cloverfield) which can add to the suspense, but by the end of the film I was hoping to see or learn just a little more about it.

All in all, The Ruins is one of the most shocking horror films I have seen in quite some time and worth a trip to the theater.",1207267200,40,909,4.159090909090909

I didn't feel it offered a good fright but it was certainly creepy. Creepy you ask? The name of the game here is 'different'. It is not going to be your standard serial killer or ghost. I think that is part of what is charming about both the movie and the book. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone by giving away details, but I think when faced with a situation as weird as this one it would be hard to react any differently then the way some of these people did. The set was beautiful and set in a jungle. I think they could have expanded on some of the scenes and made the main area a little bigger (by doing this they may have gotten into a little more danger). But maybe that was what the writer/director was going for: intimacy. How can things go so horribly wrong when other people are so very close and within a few feet of one another. Well, I suppose you will just have to sit and watch. All in all, it was entertaining but I probably won't watch it again simply because the love of the book was so strong and pretty different from the film (read the book...sorry guys I had to!).

The good:
- Original concept for the story
- Actors are good (not perfect, but definitely good)
- Great special fx (everything fits well and doesn't feel over done)

The Bad:
- The story is a little cliche at the beginning and at the very end (not enough to ruin the movie at all, but worth a mention)
- Can easily pick out who is most likely to survive it all (which is kinda standard in horror)

3343014,5,B0013FZUQA,"Scott B. Smith, writer of ""A Simple Plan"" (the novel and the 1998 movie), also wrote the 2008 novel & film ""The Ruins,"" which is about two college couples vacationing in Mexico who hook up with a German and visit an unknown Mayan pyramid off the beaten track. They are terrorized when local Natives surround the pyramid with deadly weapons, refusing to permit them to leave, and more horrified by the reason why!

""The Ruins"" refuses to make the mistake of too many conventional horror flicks by not going over-the-top with the situation, the ""monster"" or the horror/thrills, which makes these films more goofy than horrifying. For instance, take the ending of ""The Ruins"" (which is different than the book and, in my opinion, better): In a typical horror movie there would've been a wild (i.e. thrilling but totally unbelievable) vehicle pursuit by the Mayan descendants; not here. It's the BELIEVABILITY of ""The Ruins"" that makes it effective, which is reinforced by the notable acting of the five protagonists.

Speaking of which, I don't normally notice acting performances, but I found the acting stellar by the main protagonists - Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric and Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German. The two girls and Tucker (Jeff) especially stand out.

I found these protagonists likable and fairly fleshed-out for a 90-minute horror flick. For one, they're not the typical frat trash you see in so many horror movies. Secondly, we see signs of character again and again, which I detail below.

Some complain that the non-human antagonists are decidedly un-scary, but that's one of the main points of the movie. Like 1963's ""The Birds,"" it takes something we see every day and are NOT scared of and turns them into a source of horror.

One memorable scene is when Stacy and Amy are in the dark bowels of the pyramid searching for a cell phone they keep hearing. What they discover is equal parts shocking, surreal and amazing. More on this below. Another memorable sequence is when Jeff & Eric are forced to perform a gruesome operation. The ending is also well-done and suspenseful.

While the story takes place on the Yucatn Peninsula, Mexico, it was surprisingly shot at Gold Coast and Tamborine Mountain, Australia, just south of Brisbane, which is on the East coast. In any case, the locations are spectacular.

BOTTOM LINE: ""The Ruins"" really surprised me in light of the inexplicable mediocre ratings and incessant panning. It's an adventure story mixed with psychological horror utilizing something common and un-scary as the ""monster."" It features quality gore, excellent locations & props, top-of-the-line performances and quality filmmaking in general. Plus it takes advantage of the presence of Laura Ramsey and eschews the overdone cartoony-ness of too many horror flicks, which are more funny than creepy or horrifying. In other words, ""The Ruins"" delivers the goods.

The theatrical version runs 90 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes. I viewed the latter.

GRADE: B+ or A- (a strong 4/5 Stars or weak 5/5 stars)

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)

The plants that live on the pyramid and what they are able to do spur a fascinating point: The animal kingdom spans the spectrum of worms to human beings. What about plant life? The plants at the Mayan ruins are obviously from the higher-developed end of the plant kingdom - they work as a team to obtain sustenance and are able to mimic sounds, like human voices and the ringtone of a cell phone, etc.

I've heard complaints about how the protagonists constantly make the wrong decisions. Answer: The foursome had befriended Mathias and therefore trusted him. They wanted to experience some Mayan history off the beaten track. When the Natives suddenly arrive on the scene and brutally shoot one of their members in the head the only place for them to safely flee is the pyramid. At that point they're stranded because the Natives have the ruins surrounded. How is any of this a wrong decision?

Besides, show me a list of the most popular horror flicks and I'll be able to cite way more ridiculous decisions by the protagonists than seen in ""The Ruins.""

Someone complained that the youths never attempt to escape the pyramid until it is basically too late, which supposedly defies logic. Answer: They're only on the pyramid for two nights and were waiting for help to arrive. Their only other recourse was to make a run for the jungle, which was impossible because the pyramid was surrounded by Natives with deadly weapons who already proved they would kill without mercy anyone infected by the plants. As such, the most logical thing to do was to wait for help and only make a run for it (to the jungle) if they absolutely had to, which is what happens. Sounds logical to me.

I've heard the criticism that the protagonists are imbeciles with little character development. I found them likable, as noted above, and there are numerous examples of character: They desire to experience the culture of the area and not just utilize their exotic vacation to party, like the average one-dimensional spring-breakers. Also, they refuse to leave Mathias for dead in the pyramid and the girls risk going down the same dubious rope that resulted in his fall. Moreover, Jeff insists on performing the gruesome task of cutting off Mathias' legs and Eric agrees to help even while the primitive operation causes him to vomit. Lastly, Jeff willingly sacrifices himself so that Amy has a chance to escape and she makes a bold dash for freedom. All this sounds like character to me.

Needless to say, the criticisms leveled at the film are mostly invalid or easily explained.",1424476800,,5738,4.912190082644628

3343040,2,B0013FZUQA,"Such a great novel turned into such crap.  I'm not going to spoil the ending by pointing out that it is completely lame.  I am going to complain a bout the visual where the place the vine is growing is a Mayan Temple.  The entire scene where they enter the Maya territory  is completely wrecked, and would have been a better use of footage to do it honestly rather than watching twenty minutes of the girls in their bikinis coming on to the boys.  Scott Smith describes the hill as (and please note there is no Maya temple in here): ""This clearing wasn't a field.  It looked like a road but it wasn't that either.  It was as if a gang of men had planned to build a road....On the far side of it rose a small hill.  The hill was rocky, oddly treeless, and covered with some kind of vinelike growth...""  Where from that do you get the steps of a Maya temple?  The headman of the village in this movie doesn't even have Maya features.  It's a shame that Hollywood once again could not get this right.  I'm with Steven King, the book is one of the creepiest I have ever read.  The movie takes the low and easy road, and arrives pretty much nowhere.  The vines look like Christmas decorations!  Unbelievable!  Where is the slimiest?  Where is the evil?  And don't blame it on the Maya, they're just trying to contain it.",1409788800,,1315,4.297959183673469

3343061,3,B0013FZUQA,"The Ruins, a dark and visceral novel of modern horror by Scott Smith, has been named as The best horror novel of the new century (Stephen King). Published on July 18th 2006 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., the film rights for the story adaption of The Ruins were sold to Red Hour Films before the novel was even completed. Scott Smith, being a friend of Red Hour Films owner Ben Stiller, had shown the film company the outline of the novel along with the first three chapters of the book during the writing process. Stiller and his company snatched up film rights then and there, requesting that Smith also write the film adaptation for the book. The company then produced, filmed, and released the film adaptation by April of 2008, a mere 2 years after the books original release.
 The Ruins focuses on a group of young college-aged Americans who travel to the wild interior of the Yucatan in search of an archaeological dig site. Upon finding the ruins, the group quickly discovers that the location is much more sinister and terrifying than anything they expected. The story quickly develops into one of survival and human frailty. While many of the stories elements are adapted or changed for the purpose of film, the integral meaning is carried between the novel and the traditional film adaptation.
 The original text has a slow burn, melting off like wax on a candle until there is nothing left of the characters in the end. The young group members spend much of the 509 pages deliberating methods of survival in the harsh wilderness before slowly be widdled down, physically and emotionally, and picked off one by one. The film on the other hand feels more like an intense napalm, burning liquid fast to its end in less than an hour and a half. The planning becomes condensed to a small portion of the film before the bloody attacks come upon the characters.
 The film, though bearing a remarkably close resemblance to the novel, is a less satisfying rendition of the themes of survival and human frailty. It keeps the integral meaning but fails to interweave it among the characters. In the end it seems as if The Ruins is more of a teaser for what is to come in the novel. By dropping the element of building tension we lose much of the fear that is inherent in the text.  Likely, the strongest contributing factor to this loss is the change to the ending of the story. The small amount of hope introduced through the films final shot manages to extinguish the riveting and terrifying note the book ends on.
 As its own creature the film is an entertaining and remarkable work. The text alone is simply the best horror novel I have read in many years. Together, there is much to glean from both versions of this macabre story. However, the film feels more like a flash fiction rendition of a well-developed novel that lacks the eloquent character development and analysis of humanity that the novel offers.",1384473600,2,2909,4.662768031189084

3343076,3,B0013FZUQA,"As you've probably noticed, a lot of reviewers are complaining about a lack of character development. And to be honest, they are justified in that complaint. There really is no character building, so when the characters perish, which some obviously do, you really won't care. And even if you did care, there is no evil villain or torturous entity that makes their deaths memorable or necessary. To put things into perspective, and to give you an idea of what this movie is, nobody gets killed by plants. The problem here is that while the book focused on psychological trauma and less on the actual plants, the movie does neither. This would have worked well in the film, but the screenwriters decided to throw out the psychological aspects of the book and simply create an evil plant that really is there and really does feast on human flesh. Problem is, you don't really see much of the plants, just some moving vines that do eventually, briefly, get inside one person. So is it a movie about a killer plant? No. It's about a group of college kids stranded on top of a Mayan temple harassed by the locals with guns and bows. The characters are stereotypical drivel. There is the foreign guy they meet who takes them to the temple, the heroic male lead, his whiny girlfriend, the crazy partying blonde and her nerdy whiny boyfriend. Is it about the psychological trauma that they each endure? No. There's none of that. So why watch it other than to see people get killed? Well, there really is no reason to. If you're a die hard horror fan than maybe you'll like it for it's decent production values, nasty, well done gore, and brief flashes of jungle cinematography. I went to the same high school as the director, Carter Smith, and I admire his efforts. He's not a seasoned director and this is his second feature length film. With that said, it's a phenomenal achievement. I hope he goes on to bigger and better things, and I wish him all the best luck.

But those things were not what the movie lacked and made it mediocre:  There was little, if any, exploration into the emotional and psychological factors that plagued each of them.

The movie revolves around some twenty-somethings going deep into the jungle to an old pyramid that the natives are frightened of...for good reason.  They get trapped there by the natives, who won't let them leave...also, for good reason.  Turns out the pyramid is covered inside and out with these vines that have a mind (and agenda) all their own.

I think that the most creepy part was how the plants kept trying to get inside of people.  That definitely had a good ick factor going for it.  Plants as the ""monster"" is not your typical bad guy and somehow the way the leaves and vines moved all on their own was kinda unsettling.

***************************

It's too bad, because I was getting into this movie. In fact, it was just starting to remove the bad taste of The Cave, when the vines became suddenly sentient and started actively attacking the two girls, after it was discovered the vines' flowers were producing the mysterious ring of a cell phone. First, CG is always a bad idea, and in a movie like this, it should be completely unnecessary. Second, the idea of a sentient, malevolent plant that moves impossibly fast and responds intelligently and can magically adapt to mimic different sounds is pretty ludicrous. Lots of things I could nit-pick and really, I'm not being critical just to be critical -- this aspect of the film is what ruined it (haha) for me. If they had stuck with the vines moving very slowly, growing over night, and if the 'sound' being produced was limited to the ringing and a very nebulous ringing, then I probably would have been able to accept it. The idea that the plant could make a sound to lure them was pretty creepy and a good idea -- I just think it was way overdone from what was necessary.

The plant slowly growing overnight toward them, in the manner of vines, was just fine and more than scary enough. A faint, distorted ring, would have been much creepier than so accurately reproducing the cell phone ring, not to mention their voices... like a talking parrot. They really took it beyond reasonable limits with the voice mimicking.

Oh and the vine grabbing the torches... that were burning with oil-soaked rags (alcohol, whatever) ... wouldn't a plant, especially a 'smart' plant (not that I'm in any way condoning it) draw back, away from fire? How did the fire go out, without setting the entire vine patch aflame? While we're on this line of thought, why didn't they try burning the vine to begin with, as soon as they found out it was after them? This too, did not make any sense.

Other than these quibbles, the film was actually quite good and somewhat better than I was expecting. There's a brief topless scene (getting dressed), and a fair amount of skin shown, but nothing too crazy. I'm on the fence as to whether this is worth owning, but there's definitely much worse out there.",1320105600,,2245,4.690355329949239

3343106,2,B0013FZUQA,"I'll admit right upfront, I've never read the book that ""The Ruins"" is based from. So, I can't really comment on how true the movie is to the original story. What I can say, though, is that this movie did nothing to make me want to seek out the book it is based on.

I really wanted to like this movie. I've been so hoping for a good rated R horror movie for some time. All these remakes and torture films masking as horror, have really had me thinking maybe no one knows how to make a new and original horror movie anymore. I was praying ""The Ruins"" would change that feeling for me, but it has only intensified it.

The film starts off well enough, with a couple of young college couples vacationing in Mexico, when they are given the opportunity to check out some ""off the tour guide"" ruins, before they have to leave. The first 30-40 minutes of the film is pretty solid stuff. You even come to like the characters a little.

Once they reach the ruins, though, the movie starts to lose it. It never is explained exactly where these vines came from, or what the deal with them is. We come to see the nearby villagers are trying to keep them from spreading, but we don't know how or why. The whole threat the vines pose really isn't given any kind of explanation, which only leads to unsatisfying questions that don't get answers.

There are a few really gory moments in the film, but most of it happens within the last third of the film. And by this point, you really just don't know what to make of anything that you care a whole lot about it. It just feels like gore for the sake of it.

The only truly ""jump from your seat"" moment is when the girls first come to learn of the danger the vines represent, otherwise there is little in the way of suspense in the movie. In fact, the vines seem to do less damage to these tourists, than they end up doing to themselves. So they don't seem to pose much of a threat, after all. And when the lone survivor escapes, you are left wondering what this means for the rest of the world, since keeping the vines contained was made into such an important point in the film. And the ending of the film? Total rubbish, which is all I have to say about that.

""The Ruins"" starts off like a classic horror film from the late 70's and early 80's, but soon degenerates into little more than a plodding and uninteresting film, that relies on some torturous moments of gore to try to shock you awake again. It almost feel disingenuous to call it a horror film, since the only thing to provide you with horror, is the realization that you aren't going to get the those 91 minutes of your life back. If there was a moral to this movie, I guess it would be to stick to the tourist traps, when you are in a strange country. But I'd impart the additional moral to stick to renting a good horror movie, over viewing this poorly done effort.",1311811200,,2866,4.259191176470588
3343107,3,B0013FZUQA,"Tourists visiting a Mayan temple become trapped in terrifying situation, in The Ruins (2008), a horror adventure set in the jungles of Mexico.  The film earns some points for originality, as the visitors are held as virtual prisoners, and are threatened by strange flesh craving vegetation.  The situation quickly goes from bad to worse for the tourists, whose most every move results in a disaster.  The film does feature some decent special effects, creatively designed carnivorous plants, and some messy gore, that should provide some thrills for horror fans.

Four Americans hook up with some German tourists, joining them on a trip into the jungle to visit an archeological dig.  The group make their way to an ancient Mayan temple that is partially covered with vegetation.  At that point, a group of native people with weapons suddenly appear.  When Amy (Jena Malone) steps on some vines, the agitated natives kill one of the tourists, and force the rest of the group to climb to the top of the temple.

At the top, they find a couple of tents, and a winch setup over a shaft that goes down into the center of the temple.  With no working phones, Mathias (Joe Anderson) is lowered down into the shaft, when a phone is heard ringing below.  Unfortunately, the rope breaks, and Mathias breaks his back after falling to the bottom.  Stacy (Laura Ramsey) and Amy descend into the shaft, and with Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) manning the winch, the group manages to lift Mathias up to the top.

Things start to get messy, as the survivors discover that the vines can move, enter the body, and even kill.  Stacy finds that the vines have entered a wound in her leg.  Well aware of how dangerous the plants are, the natives are determined to keep the group from leaving the temple.  Mathias' condition worsens, leading to a rather crude amputation of his legs.  This is followed by more surgery, as Jeff cuts into Stacy, pulling out vines moving through her flesh.  After another crisis and more bloodshed, the survivors make a dash for freedom.

While the deadly vines don't really do that much, killer vegetation makes for a nice change of pace, and the related special effects while low key, are executed pretty well.  The film manages to get by, with the action limited to the top of the temple, the cavern inside, and a few selected views of the ground below.  Attention is directed only on the side of the temple with steps.  Presumably the other three sides are ignored because they are covered with vines, but it's a pretty convenient plot hole, that facilitates Amy's escape attempt.

The characters are not complete idiots, and there is usually some intelligence behind their actions, but unfortunately they have bad luck in almost everything they try, and usually wind up compounding their troubles.  Although you may not really like the group a lot, overall the acting is pretty good for what the film is.  Laura Ramsey does a very good job as Stacy, as the character kind of slowly slides into a self-destructive madness.  Jena Malone's Amy is often quite annoying, but she does step up at those times when it really counts.

The DVD has a solid set of extra features, including a commentary with director Carter Smith and editor Jeff Betancourt, deleted scenes, and various featurettes.  Adapted from a book by Scott Smith, who also wrote the screenplay, the plot of The Ruins isn't that believable, but it holds together well enough, and without too many scenes of annoying dialog, the film moves along briskly, providing some tense moments and brief scares.",1306972800,,3592,4.817292006525285

The movie has a sense of panic that makes the movie even more intense.

The pros
 Nice interesting setting. The story is interesting with a group of people visiting some ancient ruins and getting into trouble with a group of Mayans. I though the cast did a great job and acted their parts well. I found a plant as the main protagonist to be a change of pace and some what interesting. The film is bloody for those who like that sort of thing. As a fan of the book it was cool to see these characters and setting visualized on the big screen. This unrated version also has some deleted scenes and director commentary. The effects people did a good job making every thing look good in my opinion.

The cons

The film doesn't have any of the character development of the book. Characters roles and situations are switched around which I didn't care for. The vine is a lot more scary in the book and does more to scare and unsettle the characters in the book. The ending was changed from the book which is inferior to the book's ending to me. A number of events of the books are missing which really hurt the film in my opinion. Some scenes of violence may disturb some. One scene were a characters gets his legs cut off is very gory. Missing the heart and soul of the film. You don't get the same sense of foreboding doom like the book. The film tries to rush through things to fast.

conclusion.

A pretty decent version of the book. Worth watching for hardcore fans of the book,but inferior to the book. They gutted out some of the best parts of the book. A number of the best parts of the book which raised the fear and tension are gone here. I'd suggest reading the book over this any day. I hope somebody comes along one day and makes a more faithful version of the book.",1282521600,,1973,4.421487603305785
3343128,1,B0013FZUQA,"I hate horror movies that make me laugh.  From the films opening shot of that chick screaming in such an unconvincing and stereotypically obnoxious manner I knew that this movie was going to be an unintentional riot.  It delivered in that regard.  I have yet to read the book from which this film was adapted.  I hear mixed things about it.  One thing that I hear the most though is that the book is FAR better than the film, so I may have to check it out eventually.

The movie follows a group of really stupid American youngsters as they are eaten alive by some carnivorous plants surrounding some `off the map' ruins.  The group is attempting to gain some culture in their last day in Mexico and so they blindly follow some German guy they meet at the hotel pool who happens to tell them that he is going to meet his brother and some chick he just met out by the ruins the following day.  They decide to tag along and they regret it almost immediately when a group of savage Mayans trap them atop the ruins and refuse to let them leave.  They are baffled, but once the plants start hissing and biting them they realize that the Mayans are afraid of these idiot American's spreading the disease that is these ungodly plants.

The group then has to find a way to survive, or at least that is what you would think they would do.

I have so many issues with this horrible movie that it is almost pointless to try and list them all.  First of all, the plants are laughably un-scary.  When they actually perform their first real attack on the two girls I almost spit out my beer it was so funny.  The computer animated look to the whole thing was just ridiculous.  The scare factor is lost in the way in which the scenes are shot.  It is also lost when you consider how annoyingly retarded these kids appear to be.  They do NOTHING right and in the end you are just begging for the plants to quite wasting their time and just eat these stupid kids.  They make one ridiculous decision after another, from leaving a wounded friend mere inches from the plants unattended when they could have easily moved him to repeatedly trying to calm a hysterical friend with a knife.  They never truly attempt an escape until it is basically too late, which defies all logic.

I'm baffled at the lack of intelligence the script allots these characters.

The acting is actually the perfect compliment to the script, stagy and unrealistic, kind of like the characters.  I used to really like Jena Malone and I thought she would have a great career...but she appears to know nothing about evolving as an actress and her performance here is just awful.  Jonothan Tucker is annoyingly unattractive, and the way he talks is a distraction.  Laura Ramsey is beautiful to the eyes, and one of the more convincing aspects of the film, so I won't attack her or Shawn Ashmore too much, even though they are hindered by the scripts lack of attention to detail.  They come off as one-dimensional, which is a shame since this film really could have used some character development.

In the end this film is just lazy.  It doesn't really try to do anything and so it succeeds in being a forgettable mess.  The gore is there, and the amputation scene is genuinely squeamish, but it winds up being a mere moment of gratification in a film that serves no purpose other than to annoy the audience with its lack of intelligence.",1281916800,2,3389,4.47557003257329

However, it's done in such a way as to adequately build some genuine tension, and along the way build some characters which may not be exactly likeable, but are at least believable.  At least we start to care if they survive, which makes this a cut above many of this ilk.  In this movie, they naively take a detour from their beach `n' booze vacation to explore some Mayan ruins which mysteriously do not appear on any of the maps.  When they arrive at the vegetation covered ruins, they find themselves quarantined by some particularly belligerent natives, and things quickly deteriorate as they begin to realise the natives have good reason to be afraid of the Ruins, and of never letting a soul leave alive.
The director does not overplay the gore (even though it IS in places gory) and it plays for the most part as a survival pic.  If the movie is in genre terms routine, it has some plusses.. the little known cast do a decent job, and the maguffin they are scared of is kind of a neat idea, even if somewhat stretching the realms of believability.  The scenes that work best are the claustrophobic scenes with the relationships between the friends believably unravelling as the threat and tension mounts.  If the horror element is too tame for horror fans, but a little strong for a more mainstream audience, the sugar that makes the pill go down is when you take this as a character piece.. that's when it works best.
Somewhat of an oddity then, this is not without merit... if you've seen the trailer though, you probably know most of what happens.  Worth a rent.",1274918400,2,1754,4.650485436893204
3343141,1,B0013FZUQA,"The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie ""The Ruins"" is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of ""A Simple Plan,"" adapting his own bestselling novel, sticks steadfastly to the standard clichs and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense, we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore, unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed, ""The Ruins"" provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines.

The set-up for ""The Ruins"" resembles the 2006 horror movie ""Turistas"" where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed, ""Turistas"" generated some legitimate thrills and chills. ""The Ruins"" spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill.

The rest of ""The Ruins"" borrows from another movie: ""The Descent,"" a superb, 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind, too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic ""The Lost Continent"" about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (1961)about a New York florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop..

""The Ruins"" unfolds in the scenic, sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the ""X-Men"" movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of ""The Covenant""), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of ""Sleepers"") and Amy (Jena Malone of ""Pride & Prejudice""), are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool, but a helpful Teutonic, twentysomething tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson of ""Copying Beethoven"") recovers it, and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party, and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept.

First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going, you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left, and they haven't done anything adventurous, our two couples along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend, Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear, you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat.

No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted, and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually, the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, ""The Ruins"" turns into ""Bug,"" the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison, it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame.

""The Ruins"" ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it.",1268784000,,4649,5.102496714848883

Guess what happens when a group of college students and some newly acquired foreign friends - none of whom know Spanish, or any other useful, local foreign language for that matter - decide to do some remote exploration while on vacation in Mexico?

Couples Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Jena Malone), and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) and Eric (Shawn Ashmore - Iceman from X-Men) decide to eschew leisurely beach resort activities to visit a remote archeological dig, proposed by their new friends Mathias (Joe Anderson) and Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas), discovering a remote Mayan temple.  Immediately thereafter, armed men on horseback ride up and surround the tourists.  Hostilely barking orders, the locals shoot an arrow into Dimitri's chest, following it up with revolver fired head shot, splattering brains everywhere.  Terrified, the friends make their way up the vine-covered ruins that look suspiciously sacrificial.  For some reason, however, the men do not pursue, leaving the tourists quarantined.  Once atop the pyramid, the tourists learn they have more to fear than the men below.

For a fairly predictable horror movie, the filmmaking and script is nonetheless terrifying.  Creeping, insidious terror and obvious danger are used efficiently in this film.  Add in a healthy dosage of gore, a vicious amputation, the worst two surgeries one could wish upon their worst enemy, and the result is a complete loss of all hope.  Even though the character development was nonexistent I didn't care.  What I did care about was the fact that not a single person tried to actively fight back against their impending deaths (vine grenades anyone?); that was aggravating.

Despite the fact that I could constantly predict the next scene, it's nonetheless heart-stopping.  A new, creative perspective on suspenseful horror-thriller without sparing quality, The Ruins will cause me to stay ON the beaten path more often than not.

The gore isn't constant, but when it is used it is very effective..the surgery scene is as bad as anything I've seen on film, including the so-called ""torture porn"" genre.  Some other reviewers mock ""The Ruins"" for having a plant as it's monster, but I thought that it was cool and not something I'd seen before.  And for being the stereotypical teens who will die, the cast was game and delivered better acting than I'm used to seeing in these kinds of films.

Two pairs of fairly witless young folks decide to team up with a young German vacationer to venture into the jungle where his sister is an archaeologist investigating an obscure Mayan temple ruin. When they finally arrive at the site, the locals make them wish they'd never heard of the place... and that's hardly the end of their troubles -- killer vines abound!

The screenplay comes from the Scott B.

As is true in so many cases, the novel is far superior to the film version. Smith also wrote the screenplay.

The acting is actually pretty good as horror films go and the camera work is equally good. Also, the two shapely girls are very easy on the eyes, including Jena Malone (as Amy) and Laura Ramsey (as Stacy.) The film features some brief sexual content.

There are some really dumb aspects to this film but to reveal them would generate a number of significant spoilers... so I won't disclose those incidents here. Just take my word for it that as people get injured, the two boyfriends aren't very skilled as first-aiders.

The movie runs for 90 minutes (the unrated version runs for 93 minutes) and the aspect ratio is 2.35:1. All the film footage was actually shot in Australia but the locations look real enough.

3343152,2,B0013FZUQA,"Relatively spoiler free thoughts:
The Ruins falls into the ""people making bad decisions"" type of movie.  Every problem that befalls our characters ultimately stems from bad decisions that they make.  Chief among those bad decisions...?  Taking a 20 mile taxi ride to the middle of nowhere in a jungle in Mexico into an area with no cell service and LETTING THE TAXI DRIVER LEAVE!  Just going to hike back through the jungle huh guys?  Sure there's a Jeep there but they don't know if they'll be able to find the person with the keys and didn't even try to stop the taxi driver or ask him to come back later.

They do this type of thing often.  They end up going to the ruins they came to see and are quickly encircled by some crazy men waiving guns around who won't let them leave.  On top of the pyramid they hear a cell phone down in a deep dark hole.  Never mind that none of them have cell service (and have not had it for quite some time while hiking) and another phone in the same location down inside a pyramid should have no chance - and that it keeps ringing and ringing and never going to voice mail, let's drop down in there and get it!  Granted they were pretty freaked out.  I think I'd still check the rope that's been out in the elements for who knows how long first before I let my friends drop me in a hole though.

Before long several of the crew are hurt and they start to learn why they've been quarantined.  And they begin to be picked off one by one in various ways.  Good thing the characters are the typical 1 note fair so we're not too emotionally involved.  There's whiny girl, likable guy, other whiny girl who turns out to be tougher than she looks, bossy guy, injured guy and guy who gets killed really early on so we know this movie means business.

Some silly plot elements, unlikable and uninteresting characters and a lack luster ""monster"" make this a pretty lame movie.  It did have a few creepy moments and decent effects though and a couple of gory moments.  It's a one watcher.

Slightly more spoiler filled discussion:
 OK the monster is a plant.  You probably already knew that.  As far as a monster antagonist goes it wasn't very good.  It demonstrates that it is fast and strong and fully capable of grabbing a person and dragging them off yet it instead tries to use traps and slowly sneak up on people while they sleep.  Must not have been a very hungry plant.  It has the ability to mimic sounds, which is an interesting concept but not used very well in my opinion.  I will say this though, seeing the plant grow up inside of people and killing them is pretty creepy and a scene where whiny girl tries to cut the plants out of her is easily one of the bloodiest moments in the film.

The idea of these people quarantining the pyramid so this plant can't spread is also interesting but wouldn't it make more sense to scare people away instead of letting them get there and then keeping them there to die?  I kind of got the sense that these people were trying to do a good thing but it seems they chose a weird way of doing it.  The movie even starts with another person trapped in the pyramid before our group arrives.  I'm starting to think these guys are just jerks.

In the end the less whiny girl gets away though and nothing is made of that.  We just see some new folks showing up at the pyramid (Hey guys! Scare them away this time don't just let them.... Too late).  The whole point was that these guys were quarantining our group in so I'd have thought that seeing the plant spreading because she got away would be a more sensible ending.  Oh well, I'm no film maker.  Much of this plot seemed silly to me.",1254441600,,3659,4.307467057101025

Not so good was the movie itself.  The premise of the movie, best described as shrubs gone wild, doesn't really lend itself to building much tension, much less actual horror.  It doesn't help that the killer plants, especially on the blue ray version, don't look that real.

Without any tension, the film becomes more of a gorefest, and with an amputation scene and a self-mutalation scene, it delivers to that on some extent.  Some of the characters are sympatheic and you can root for their survival, but unfortunately the sympatheic characters die off before the end leaving only the ones you wish would die.

And when will these dumb American tourists ever learn?  You'd think that, after all those cheapjack horror movies, they'd have figured out that the minute some smooth-talking stranger in a foreign land offers to take them on a private tour to some ""off-the-beaten-path"" attraction, the only sensible response would be to run as far and as fast as possible in the opposite direction.  You'd think so.  But instead they inevitably pile into a rickety old pickup (or bus or motor scooter or whatever mode of transportation happens to be available in that particular movie) and eagerly head off to a place that even Vincent Price wouldn't be caught dead going to on his creepiest day.

In ""The Ruins,"" the victims are two American couples - Jeff and Amy and Stacy and Eric - who are just wrapping up their vacation in Mexico, and the stranger a charming German man who offers to escort them to a mysterious Mayan temple buried deep in the secluded jungle.  Before you know it, the five of them are at the mercy of some murderous locals who, for some initially undisclosed reason, refuse to allow them to leave the structure.

Though there's a decent amount of suspense in the early stretches of the film - and even one pretty nice turnaround in the plot - once the ""true nature"" of the menace is revealed, the movie becomes tedious and silly.  Moreover, it expends more effort trying to gross us out than actually scaring us.  I mean, just how many dismemberments and anesthesia-free operations are we expected to sit through before finally crying uncle?

Well, they did make a movie out of it, and predictably, a couple of things get lost in translation. The book was highly atmospheric and tense - these are a group of young people who get trapped on a sort of pyramid for days, battling their fears, sense of isolation, and the very real threat posed by the vegetation that grows around the place.

In the movie, the roles of the young people are ably portrayed by Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, and Joe Anderson as Matthias. It all begins on a lark - Matthias is trying to locate his brother, who is working on a dig somewhere deep in the forests of the Yucatan Peninsula. The two American couples decide to go along with him for fun. The idea of exploring some unexplored ancient Mayan ruins is just too irresistible and eventually they do locate the place, only to find themselves trapped there as the locals will not let them leave the ruins.

The cast is the strength of this movie - the actors really do get into their respective roles and the chemistry comes across as natural and not forced. These are characters that one comes to genuinely care about and sympathize with, unlike other B-grade horror flicks where one couldn't care less what happens to the mostly idiotic and immature cast.

The effects are not shoddy either - and there are some really gory effects in here - involving cutting out the creepy, 'malicious' vines out of bodies etc, not for the faint of heart.

In adapting the book for the big screen, some liberties have been taken with the plot, and even the characters are portrayed as doing stuff that is different than in the book. The ending was a disappointment to me as it was totally different than the book, but all in all, this is a pretty decent horror thriller and the suspense holds for much of the movie.",1247356800,,2019,4.508196721311475

They have fire, and plenty of fuel (alcohol) to burn the vines.  Yet, they never do this.  Instead, a really inane movie occurs.  Horrible actors, just plain awful.

3343173,2,B0013FZUQA,"When it comes to horror films very rarely doesn't the thought of a plant pop into your head. Usually a masked killer that can't be stopped, some type of crazed creature, or a mysterious entity rule in the world of scares but not this time. Oh no this time our poor cast must attempt to survive the wrath of some fast growing highly intelligent vines. Certainly the premise is quite different from what we're used to which is refreshing. However the way it played out in this one left us more bored then anything else.

Two coulpes head on down to Mexico for a little relaxing vacation. On their second to last day they decide to take a trip to explore some ancient Mayan ruins. They aren't content checking out the well known ruins though. They want to find one with no tourists for the real effect. They meet a man named Mathais who is in search of his brother working on an archeological site and shows the crew where to go. Once they get to their destination they are chased up the ruins by a gang of crazed Mayan's. As they are stranded they begin to realize the people are less of a threat then the vines growing everywhere. These vines know how to mimic sounds and voices to send the crew through a psychological test of survival in which some fail miserably.

Upon our explination you may think the film sounds great, but it's not. It does have a very interesting premise and some decent acting. The problem is the film is way drawn out and the characters really begin to get on you nerves. Usually films based off of books never live up to the challenge as The Ruins proves. If you have the chance to catch it you may want to check it out since some people rave about it. Guess it's in the eye of the beholder here. As fas as Sid goes this one is NOT one that would have been enjoyed in the glory days.",1244678400,,1810,4.2894736842105265
3343174,4,B0013FZUQA,"""The Ruins"" is arguably an under-rated horror film. The plot centers around a group of four twenty-somethings (it's implied they are in their early twenties, due to one character's comments about medical school) who decide to take an expedition into the Yucatan rain forest in search of an unmarked ruin that one of the character's sister, an archaeologist, had been searching for. They find the ruins, but unfortunately, the ruins are guarded by a group of local Indians - and once one of the characters makes the mistake of touching the ruins, the Indians shoot at and frighten them until they are effectively quarantined upon the ruins (a pyramid, to be exact).

Confused and frightened (one of this film's strong points is the acting, which is excellent throughout the film from the largely unknown cast), the characters explore the pyramid while struggling to think of a way to escape their ""guards"". What they find is that the pyramid is infested with a rapidly-growing, highly dangerous carnivorous vine, which the Indians have kept at bay on the pyramid by salting the ground surrounding it. The vine continually encroaches upon the main characters in their prison.

As mentioned earlier, one of the strong points of this film was the acting, which is well-done throughout the movie. This is complemented by the beautiful scenery.

The movie's main weak point is that the premise is inherently limiting. Once the characters are quarantined, the movie is bound into two options: either they escape, or they die up there. The choice the movie ultimately makes, and its execution, is the primary weakness in an otherwise good horror film.",1243900800,,1643,5.033088235294118

I went into the film with low expectations, and the film merely confirmed those expectations.  Acting is average, and effects are OK for those who don't lose interest after the first half hour.  Fortunately, I was working on something on my laptop at the time, so I can at least count that hour and a half of my life as not being completely wasted.",1242086400,,658,4.458333333333333
3343177,4,B0013FZUQA,"If drug cartels and the Swine Flu haven't persuaded you not to visit Mexico, maybe watching ""The Ruins"" will.  This nifty horror flick is simple but very disturbing.  It has great acting from a young, attractive cast; great direction from Carter B. Smith; and is based on the best-selling novel by Scott Smith.  ""The Ruins"" is a must see for fans of creature features.

  On their last day of Spring break, a group of college friends visit an ancient Mayan pyramid.  The local, gun-toting natives are angry and keep them imprisoned there.  Meanwhile, the friends begin suffering accidents while exploring the temple in search of two tourists who went missing the day before.  As the heat increases and the food and water run out, tension and fear mount among the survivors.  Their tempers flare.  One by one they begin falling prey to a creature unlike any seen on this planet.  Using its special powers, it implants paranoia within their minds, forcing them to the edge of the pyramid, to the edge of insanity and to the horrible death that awaits them all.

  ""The Ruins"" is highly recommended for those who enjoy sun drenched, outdoor science fiction horror movies involving bizarre creatures.  This film should serve as a warning to all.  Don't visit ruins that are not on the local tour maps.  Even the birds and mammals won't go near the ruins in this film.  It is best to watch ""The Ruins"" as a double feature along with ""Turistas.""  Both films are extremely suspenseful and involve the tormenting of innocent tourists.",1241481600,,1526,4.796153846153846
3343178,4,B0013FZUQA,"I wouldn't blame you if you labeled The Ruins as yet another Hostel, Cabin Fever, Turistas clone. Good looking white Americans acting like jerks in a foreign land get brutality murdered/eaten alive. Judging from the trailers, that's exactly what The Ruins looks like....
Well, ok, they are good looking white kids in a foreign country, but they're not jerks and I can honestly say that they do not deserve what happens to them in this film.
The Ruins is actually based on a quite popular book that I never heard of until after I saw the movie. From what I hear, it's a fairly accurate adaptation (it should be, the same author wrote the book and screen play). Since I never read the book, this mini review will be based on the movie only. Bottom line, I really liked it.
2 couples are vacationing in Mexico (I think Cancun). They meet some other people and become friendly. They go on a hike to an uncharted Mayan ruin. Up until that point, it's a fairly enjoyable teen movie like any others....drinking, sex, a little nudity (wish there was more of that!). When they reach the ruins though, the s*** hits the fan....HARD CORE. Without spoiling too much, let's just say that the friends can't leave the ruins now. This is where the movie becomes a sort of Cabin Fever type movie, where they are all trapped and forced to deal with something they never thought possible. What elevates this movie from others like it is the acting and smart writing. I won't say who dies, who lives, or anything like that, but I honestly cared about the characters here and didn't want any of them to suffer the fate that many/some/all/none (heehee) received. I actually found it sad when something bad would happen to one of them. Normally, when I'm watching Hostel or Saw types, I just want to see how the next person dies.... Here I was actively hoping none of them would.
This is labeled a horror film, but it's not really scary. It's got more than its fair share of ""make you squirm"" moments, and it definitely can fill you with the ""what the F now"" kind of tension. But it's not a cheap scare movie. I guess it's more of a Misery type horror movie.
I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Hostel/Turistas type movies, but wants something that steps it up in the story and acting department. It's certainly way better than what the Saw series has become. There is one thing in the movie that I can see some people not going for...again, I don't want to spoil the plot, but it's one of those things that you either go with it, or you don't. I went with it, and I had a great time with the movie.

3343179,3,B0013FZUQA,"""The Ruins"" stars 5 Americans who set out to poke their noses where they shouldn't. Not a new premise.

They find this jungle that they KNOW better not to come to, and even worse, find an ancient ruin hidden in the middle of it. Surprised, and stoked, they decide that they want to take a closer look.

But that's not always the smart thing to do. Foreigners surround them and even kill one of their friends. They have no choice but to climb the ruin which later you learn, is bound by these moving, and seem-ably breathing plants.

It's a strange movie indeed, and some happenings ""ruin"" the movie, but I think overall, it's worth at least one watch. Based on the book of the same name by Scott Smith (of which I have yet to read), ""The Ruins"" catches the eye if you like gore, or simply don't like it because it's here; in its over-the-top fashion and it doesn't let up!

I didn't care a bit about any of the characters, so it didn't matter to me if they lived or died. The plot was a little flimsy (where did those particular plants come from? what made them act like that?), but they did stick to it pretty well, I think. And the effects were top-notch. But after watching it the one time, I haven't wanted to see it again, and one of the ways I know if I like a horror movie is if it leaves me wanting to watch it over to get all the nuances. This one just didn't to that. It was a one-time thing.

3343181,1,B0013FZUQA,"It's weird to begin a review of a movie by talking about a book, but The Ruins by Scott Smith could have been a triumph in the horror genre. But, as I stated in my review of the book, the ending is just plain awful.

Like the movie, we watch (or read about) this group as they struggle to survive against Mayan protecting themselves and the creepy plant. However in the book, all of their struggles, their small triumphs, their will to survive is absolutely pointless since not a one of them survive the ordeal. They're destined to become a pile of bones just like all the folks who have come before them. Of course this begs the question of why the author gives us their story. Since the tale for any victim of the plants ends exactly the same, why bother telling us the tale of THIS group?

Well, the movie fixed this major flaw in the book only to reverse it on the DVD. I watched the DVD with its alternate ending only to have my hopes dashed as the movie became as pointless as the book. Then, heading over to the special features, I find the theatrical ending which is 1000% better! Better than the alternate ending and the novel's.

An option would have been nice to watch the theatrical release with the proper ending but, no, they had to give us the ""special"" ending not scene in theaters. And, for that, I give the movie 1 star.

What also would have helped the movie would be to add an actual fight between the plants and humans. The group seemed content to sit and wait for the end while waiting for help. All I can say is that if I was stuck on a hill with deadly plants all around me, the damn thing would have a lot of regrowing to do after it got me. I wouldn't sit around while the ""talking"" plants mocked me. This was another flaw in the book, albeit a minor one, and I was sorry to see it carry over to the movie.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the theatrical version of the film and, if it's available on DVD (without the crappy ending), The Ruins is a horror film I'd happily add to my collection. As it stands now, I'm done with the DVD like I'm done with the book.

If you like movies where the protagonists are doomed right from the start and absolutely nothing they do to survive means anything in the end, then The Ruins is for you. If not, then don't waste you time on what could have been a great film.",1239321600,3,2334,4.221973094170403
3343182,2,B0013FZUQA,"A bunch of just of age kids locate a missing ruins in Mexico (really Australia). Of course, they are compelled to go and have a good time in the jungle. They run into strange armed people and have a symbiosis with the local flora.

This is a standard spooky ""eat them sexy dump girls"" movie. So why not at least three stars for a mediocre display of blood and gore? Because there is no effort to mask the story or add, any depth to this ridicules premise.

The added German accent was a nice touch and sticking close to the book helped but this is one novel that just does not morph well to a movie.

This film of course is a good candidate for Blu-ray as it has great color, detail, and sound. Too bad, it is wasted on a movie that is a cheap knockoff of people that need to be eaten.

3343183,3,B0013FZUQA,"I'll admit that when I first saw the trailer for ""The Ruins"" in theaters, I was pretty interested in seeing it.  Once in finally came out, however, I decided that it looked more like a DVD rental.  In my opinion, I was correct.

The film begins with a young lady in a dark room crying for help.  As usual, she can't get a signal on her cellphone and she is eventually pulled into the darkness screaming all the way.  From there, the film introduces us to four of the primary players in the film.  Amy (Jena Malone), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Eric (Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (Laura Ramsey) are on the last leg of their vacation in Mexico.  They end up meeting and befriending Mathias (Joe Anderson), a fellow traveller who's looking for someone to join him on an excursion to find his brother who happens to be working on a dig at a mysterious Mayan pyramid.

Despite Amy's resistance, the group (including another traveller, Dmitri) head off to look for Mathias' brother.  What they find is a hesitant taxi driver who only agrees to drive them for most of their journey after being given a heavy tip.  When the driver goes as far as he feels safe enough to travel, he drops them off in the jungle.  The group hoofs it to the pyramid and quickly find themselves surrounded by a jumpy group of natives who are packing pistols, bows and arrows.

Despite trying to tell the natives why they are there, the group is shot at and forced up to the top of the pyramid for reasons I don't want to reveal (and aren't clear until later in the film).  At this point, the story becomes a tale of survival and emotional anguish, both of which are fueled by the unique enemy that awaits them in the pyramid.

This film is based on a novel of the same name by Scott Smith.  Having not read that book, I cannot honestly say how closely the film follows the original story.

What I can tell you is that this movie manages to give the viewer a relatively decent group of heroes to pull for.  This is a nice twist for horror films that feature young college-aged characters.  Most of the time, I'm happy to watch the bad guys off characters since most of them are unlikeable in the first place.  While one character does receive enough attention to make it rather easy to determine who survives, there's a genuine sorrow in seeing some of the characters meet their demise in this film.

The film isn't all that scary, but does offer up a nice helping of gore.  The CGI is a bit heavy in certain parts of the film, making it a hard to accept what is happening on the screen.  There's also a brief bit of nudity and some suggestive content, but nothing as excessive as most films in this genre contain.

Overall, the film shoots itself in the foot by having all of the action limited to one area.  While this works well in other films, the enemy in this film's limited range hinders the story's overall pacing.  I can easily see how this would work much better in book form, where character and creature development can be fleshed out, but the constraints of film keep this movie from being anything more than a three star flick.

Recommended to fans of gore, creature features and films that feature a decent bit of suspense.  I wouldn't necessarily call this film a keeper, but it is worth at least a couple of viewings.",1237939200,2,3296,4.431893687707642

A group of obnoxious college kids on a trip decide to visit some distant Mayan pyramid.  When they approach a local to drive them, he balks and doesn't want to take them.  However, they persist and he drops them off.  Little do these kids realize what's in store for them.

The pyramid is covered in vines that have a taste for human flesh.  Here is where the movie gets really stupid.  A bunch of local natives surround the pyramid and threaten our heroes with violence should they try to leave.  One of the group descends into the pyramid, becomes injured and ultimately becomes fodder for the hungry vines.  I'll only mention in passing the crude attempt to amputate his legs (after which the pieces are carted off by the vines).

What these geniouses failed to learn was that the natives surriounding the pyramid were deathly afraid of the vines.  At one point a chunk of vine lands in their direction and the one guy freaks out over it.  The unofficial leader of the kids, the medical student, failed to come up with a way to use the vines to their advantage.  If they had only thrown vine chunks at the natives, or found another way to scare the native off.  But no, these college kids were too dumb to make this connection.

So ultimately only one kid escapes, a girl who was able to start up an abandoned truck then cruise through the jungle with shooting natives in hot pursuit.  The movie ends with two new explorers happily entering the scene, presumably to face a similar ordeal.

There were some engaging moments in the movie but they were few and far between. Rarely have I seen a movie veer so far away from the main story line of a novel.

3343202,5,B0013FZUQA,"I thought this was one REALLY scary movie.  Actually maybe not scary- more like disturbing.

Disturbing because the amount of blood was very high, and it just kept getting bloodier as the story went on.

These mysteriously EVIL weeds are the monster of the movie, so to speak.  They are especially drawn to blood, so whenever one of the teens started bleeding either from a big fall or got cut or whatever, the weeds would sense this and slowly sneak forward and attack without the teens knowing about it.

I admit I thought it was stupid how the plants apparently had an ability to mimic the sounds the teens would make, or the sound of a phone ringing.  I could have sworn the plants were giggling at one point.  Very silly.

But the story that involved WHY the kids weren't allowed to leave this mysterious place covered with weeds kept my interest, and I was wondering why the people who wouldn't let the teens leave were camping out and waiting for them to die.

Well, now we know why- they didn't want the teenagers to leave and possibly risk spreading the weed (which is silly, because there was one scene that showed a bird flying by, and as you probably know, a bird can simply carry leaves and seeds somewhere else, effectively spreading the weed- but we'll ignore that little mistake from the writers).

Anyway, I loved the movie, and the scenes where the weeds were actually crawling INSIDE the people and moving around inside their stomachs and legs like snakes was disturbing to me.  They looked like snakes moving around in peoples bodies!  I felt so sorry for that one blonde-haired girl and all the stuff she had to put up with.

3343203,3,B0013FZUQA,"I was very disappointed in this movie.  I loved the book by Scott Smith and found it ingenious with a clever evil source and slowly mounting terror and suspense.  It's no secret that the plants on the ruins are the evil presence.  Does it work in the film?  No, not really but the film is still better than a lot of the tepid horror films released.  So I had to give it 3 stars if only to give credit to the stars who give their all to try to make this film work.

I have honestly never seen such a bad adaption from novel to film though.  All character development is lost.  The film follows some parts of the book with 100% accuracy and totally skips others.  Without having read the book the film will make little sense.  With today's modern technology the vines and blossoms that possess such evil look very fake and plastic.  In the novel the happenings on the ruins and the reason the natives were not letting them get away was slowly revealed.  The plants power supplied much terror as its capabilities sunk into the minds of the characters.  It makes no sense in the film that these people would so easily accept the powers of the plants.

The book showed how the four characters tried to survive physically and mentally  and succeeded greatly as a survival film.  Here when alcohol is needed for an impromptu surgery it magically appears.  Who had it and where did it come from?  Throughout the film the actions of the people makes no real sense.  We have no understanding of their motivation.  This film could have been much better if treated as a psychological drama with terror combined and allowed character development and put more effort into making the plant believable and realistic.  Instead the movie takes the goriest parts from the book and utilizes them for simple horror effect.  Big mistake is all props look fake.  Body parts when being tortured etc. all look fake.

When watching a horror film one expects to suspend disbelief and go on a journey of terror and suspense.  That is with a high quality horror film.  This film is a basic B Movie and wastes the opportunity to have been a very good film.

3343204,1,B0013FZUQA,"Where to start, first of all, you should avoid any horror movies that start off with college coeds on a beach in a foreign country, it's a bad omen.  Second, if you plan to make a horror movie centered around a creature you should make the creature more visible.  Third, you should not rely on gore ALONE to make people take notice of your film.
I almost think they should have named this movie ""Hostel 3"" because the only thing that would pull your attention towards it is the gore that is shown.  The plot is as follows: 4 teenagers and a german back-packer decide to visit a ruin and get stuck there while a plant slowly turns them into gardens.  The creature of film is nothing more than a pile of vines with flowers that slowly infests someone's body or drags them off, albeit slowly.  Nothing in the movie was scary in the slightest, and considering I didn't flinch during Hostel I was not too impressed with this movie either.
I actually see this movie as more of a comedy with gore rather than a horror film, I laughed at a lot of what was said and the ridiculous actions that took place.  The first of which occurs near the beginning when the german falls from the sling that was lowering him into the temple, the med student, without batting an eye quickly says to the girls, ""One of you has to go"".  Why doesn't either of the men go?  Because they need to man the crank.  There also appears to be a hand job going on, or at least something sexual, during the most inappropriate time.  The worst part is that when everything possible goes wrong, including a death, vines coming to life, vines coming to life then killing and dragging away a corpse, and a short supply of food and water, the group STILL decides to ""hang tight"" and wait for rescue, meanwhile being surrounded by said killer plant.
This movie doesn't bring anything new to the horror genre, in fact, it probably brings my view of modern horror movies down a few notches.  It wasn't scary, it wasn't gross, it was a waste of time.  It follows the basic formula of kids getting stranded, cell phones having no service, and slowly being killed one by one.  Despite the bad reviews I wanted to see this movie to see a killer plant, but even that was a let down because it looked like anything you would see anywhere in the woods.  If you want to go see another Hostel by all means see this movie, and if you were scared by this, then you're pathetic.",1225497600,2,2421,4.375

But no amount of good acting, or lit pedigree, can elevate this grossout fest. It was disgusting. I couldn't even finish it.

I don't usually give negative reviews, but I think THE RUINS is the worst movie I've ever seen. I would give it negative stars if that were possible.",1223683200,3,433,4.551282051282051

By the pool they meet a German named Mathius, who says his brother Heinrich is missing and he's going to go look for him near some ruins.  Mathius talks the couples into going with him.  Heinrich left a map showing the location of the ruins, far off the tourist area of the Yucatan.

The next day the couples and Mathius set out, accompanied by Demitri, a Greek friend who doesn't speak English.  After a bus, a taxi, and a hike through the jungle, they discover the ancient site.  The ruins rise above the jungle floor, magnificent, and covered in blooming vines.  Mayans race out of the jungle, shouting warnings in a language the tourists don't understand ... until Dimitri is shot for stepping into the vines.  The Mayans chase the tourists onto the ruins and surround them, threatening to kill anyone who attempts to leave the cursed place.  Now they are trapped, and must struggle to survive.

There's so much more that happens in the movie but you must watch it to find out what.  The book by Scott Smith was fantastic, and since Smith also wrote the screenplay the story stays true to the book (except for a surprise altered ending).  The movie has some very decent gore in it; gory cuttings, grisly amputations, and of course, a flesh-hungry vine.  A fantastic enemy and a hopeless situation, along with gruesomely bloody scenes, save this movie from being just another typical ""slice and dice"" film.  The actors are relatively unknown but do a very decent job of performing.  The atmosphere is good and the scenery is realistic.  You feel the struggle of the trapped tourists, and care about their plight.  I'd recommend a purchase, but make sure to pick up the unrated edition.  Enjoy!",1223510400,,1765,4.712418300653595

Ruins doesn't make any secret of its pretty absurd 'monster', but the film is smart enough not to take the concept to laughable extremes. When gore befalls our travelers it's mostly self-inflicted, and the tension comes not from the usual chase but from the increasingly dire situation and the character's utter inability to escape it.

Ruins is like 'Cabin Fever' with weeds instead of viruses and the pacing follows the typical slasher pic to a tee. It doesn't get points for originality, but the cast features some familiar (if hard to place) faces, all veteran B film or bit role actors who know their stuff. I wouldn't pay $20 for it, but I'd grab it from the bargain bin in a heartbeat.

3343220,3,B0013FZUQA,"Four young, attractive Americans are in Mexico for a few days of Spring Break-like laying around and drinking.  They meet a young, attractive German guy who encourages them to go with him to visit a Mayan ruin that is off the tourist radar.  You see, his brother, an archeologist, has gone there with his girlfriend...otherwise they'd have the place to themselves.  The Americans, in a nod towards soaking up some history & culture, accompany their new friend to the ruin, which is nothing more than a modest sized Mayan pyramid, fairly well covered in some sort of vine with red flowers.  Along the way, they pick up a young Greek man, also on his way to the ruin.

They arrive and are suddenly surrounded by some natives, who speak Mayan, not Spanish, and their threatening gestures drive the 6 tourists up the pyramid and into the foliage.  This, based on the reaction of the natives, is REALLY BAD.  In fact, after touching a plant, the Greek man tries to leave, and is promptly killed by the natives.  So our remaining ""heroes"" find they are kinda stuck at the top of the pyramid.  Cell phones don't get signals, the natives are vigilant and vicious and there is no sign of the German archeologist and his girlfriend.

This is the setup for the laughable yet somehow insidiously creepy THE RUINS.  I've never read the book, so cannot judge it's faithfulness to the source material.  I can't imagine it's all that important.

As you might guess (or seen from the trailers), all is not well at this pyramid.  The seemingly harmless vines actually have fairly malevolent powers, and the 5 tourists have a pretty miserable, scary time of it.

I hesitate to tell you more of the plot.  This film isn't terrifically gory, nor are the effects even terribly convincing.  But as time wears on and the humans become more desperate to escape...the movie begins to become effective despite itself.  There is just something inherently creepy in what happens.  The idea of things literally getting under your skin is just a little too cringe-worthy to simply be laughed off.

It's a very simple, direct story that could have been readily told in 20 minutes less time...but the writers REALLY stretched to get us to 90 minutes.  The opening 15 minutes or so establishes the dynamics between the lead characters, and this portion is DEADLY dull.  We know it's obligatory...but I couldn't help thinking about the far superior THE DESCENT, which took about 6 minutes to establish its characters.  Yes, it did it in a fairly clich&eacute;d manner, but at least it got it over with in a hurry.  THE RUINS seems to take forever to get going.

The acting is spotty too.  Best known, and least successful is Jena Malone, who seems like the person you'd least want to take on spring break with you.  Whiny and high-maintenance...she does little to win our sympathy, particularly when she gets drunk and we see how poorly she behaves with her inhibitions down..  Far better is relative unknown Laura Ramsey, who endures some of the greatest hardships and is most successful at translating her fear right to the audience. Jonathan Tucker (""The Black Donnellys"") is okay as Malone's boyfriend...he is at least suitably annoyed at her through most of the film.  Joe Anderson (ACROSS THE UNIVERSE) is Mathias, their new German friend, and he lays on a thick accent, a little more that is very convincing.

But we all know we watch these kinds of movies for the thrills and chills.  I wouldn't say it delivers many thrills, but there are a decent number of chills, if you have the patience to wait for them.

I am literally completely on the fence about recommending this movie.  If you like the kind of film I've described, check it out.  If you normally shy from the genre...this is NOT the film to change your mind.",1222646400,2,3793,4.722983257229832

By isolating the story in one small geographic area (really, just one ""ruin""), writer Scott Smith increases the despair of his characters, but also limits where the narrative can go.  The main antagonist lacks the sinister, deliberate quality that it had in the book, making it seem somewhat more incidental than the secondary antagonist(s).  Without giving too much away, Smith never explains the theory of ""why"" they are trapped, as in the book, so it feels less satisfying.  Ultimately, it gets the Hollywood treatment, with a different ending, the omission of a crucial character (his lines/actions are given to other members of an already large protagonistic cast), and a final feeling of ""that's it?"".",1221177600,3,843,5.079710144927536

3343233,1,B0013FZUQA,"The Ruins (Carter Smith, 2008)

Scott Smith's novel The Ruins was either a love-it-or-hate-it book, so when the film version was released, I kind of half-assumed that the people who were reviewing it all came down on the ""hate"" side where the book was concerned. For some odd reason, despite my extensive experience watching really bad film adaptations of novels, it simply never occurred to me that Smith, who adapted his own novel, would make so many absurd changes to the book when writing the screenplay. But, oh, for the love of Pete, what changes he hath wrought. And not a single one of them does anything other than take a very interesting novel that focused on the psychological states of the people trapped at the ruins and make it into a stupid hungry-plant movie.

The plot: four friends-- Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Stacy )Laura Ramsey), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore)-- are on vacation in South America. They meet Mathias (Joe Anderson), who's going into the jungle tomorrow to look for his brother, who went out to some ruins with a cute archaeologist he met, and hasn't been back since. The four friends decide to head out there with Mathias (sans the Greeks, for those of you who read the novel) and run into some very unfriendly Mayans who, once they're on the ruins, won't let them off again. You find out why pretty quickly (again unlike the novel).

Very little effort is expended on the characters' psychological states, which is the aspect that made the book worth reading. Also, to confuse people I guess, Smith rewrote who was doing what (and who died when-- I guess if you leave the Greeks in town, everything has to change, huh?) so that there will be quite a few cognitively dissonant moments for those who have recently read the novel. And the ending-- oh jeez. Could it possibly be any dumber? At least the ending in the book made a shred of sense. Then, of course, there's the big revelation about the plant. In the book, Smith managed to turn it into a major subplot. Here, it appears as a teaser, then gets pulled out for show, and... disappears. Oh, the humanity (or florality, I guess).

A worse novel adaptation I can't remember seeing in the past five years. A worse novel adaptation written by the novelist I feel quite confident in saying I have never seen. What happened to the guy who adapted A Simple Plan? We want him back. *",1219104000,14,2378,4.641330166270784

3343237,4,B0013FZUQA,"I just watched the unrated version of The Ruins and liked it. Let me explain why I think you will too:

1) The acting and dialog were quite good....better than the screeching, amateurish, idiotic performances generally passed off as ""acting"" in similar movies. The characters behave as rational, reasonably intelligent young people and their comments and actions are both practical and appropriate. They do not go for midnight swims in haunted swamps; they do not enter darkened rooms looking for axe-wielding maniacs; instead they react like we would to the serious threats they encounter. As a result, we connect with them. This makes the horror of their predicament more involving and convincing. When people we like are threatened and killed, the experience becomes far more personal.

2) The special effects are convincing, relying on realistic prosthetics that are mutilated before our eyes...with no camera or CGI trickery. In addition, virtually all the horror scenes take place in broad daylight and in close-up. One of the greatest weaknesses of many horror movies is that the action occurs in semi- or total darkness (i.e. A vs P Requiem). Whether inferior movies do this to mask the phoniness of the effects or as a misguided effort to make it all more scary, the actual result is confusion on the part of the audience. Truly scary things can happen in broad daylight....The Ruins proves it. This takes skill and artistry, talents missing from a lot of horror movies.

3) No horror movie can rise above the quality of its ""villain"". Unfortunately, the truly classic ""monsters"" from previous great horror films (Jason, Mike Myers, Freddy Krueger, etc.) have been done and redone to the point of becoming a cliche....the source of parodies like Scream, Scary Movie, and (my personal favorite) Behind the Mask. In The Ruins, the ""monster"" is an entity which we take for granted, not realizing the startling and original powers it possesses. Hitchcock used birds, normally so familiar and nonthreatening, to terrorize audiences. Now, in The Ruins, another seemingly familiar and harmless organism comes forth to do the same. Whether or not the book (from which the movie came) does a better job in this regard is irrelevant. Imagination has an artistry that no camera can match, but in my opinion this movie comes close.

4) The photography and direction are far better than other movies of this (and other) genres. No supposedly artistic fluttery, nauseating hand-held camera work. You are given a clear view of everything that happens and allowed to judge each scene and event for yourself. Also, I was aware of no manipulation by jarring music, often a cheap way to startle and shock. Again, this subtlety requires artistry, and a respect for the audience that has become (unfortunately) so rare.

In conclusion, watch the movie and judge for yourself. Compare it to other such offering currently and recently on the market. I feel confident you will agree that The Ruins is a ""cut above"" (pun intended).",1218758400,,3015,5.046184738955823

3343253,3,B0013FZUQA,"When I read the book I thought it would make a good film, and it did.  The basic plot is that some young, rather naive people visit an out of the way archeological dig and are forced to stay on a Mayan pyramid by some locals.  The suspense, at first, is to discover the reason these locals are willing to kill anyone who steps off the pyramid.  It turns out that they are essentially in quarantine, with the Mayans basically protecting the world from a dreadful ivy escaping.  Yes, an ivy.  Pretty flowers.  This plant is, as it turns out, evil and takes over anyone it touches, infesting them, killing them.  In the book, there was the sense that the plant was intelligent.  In the film, it is just extremely invasive (kadzu gone bad), though it does have the ability to imitate sounds.

Can this end happily?  Not likely!  The worse thing is that it is pretty grizzly to watch.  The thing that really saves this movie is that the folks who made it are actually very talented.  The acting was excellent/ the directing was well done / the music was perfect / the entire ""realization,"" set design was very, very good.

Also, the acting is better than I expected and, at times, the cinematography was note worthy. But the film does have it's share of problems. The setup feels tired (a group of 20 somethings find unexpected danger on their exotic vacation), the characters lack any real depth and the scare-factor is a bit weak. The movie isn't overly gory but if people clawing/digging into their own body does more than make you squirm, this movie is best avoided.

Soon enough, they're on the run from murderous Mayans, and on their way to becoming dinner.  Despite what could be seen as a ridiculous plot line, The Ruins manages to succeed thanks to a surprisingly well-orchestrated sense of dread and tension that escalates as the blood and gore mount.  What's even more surprising about The Ruins is how often the film pulls no punches in terms of it's violence (including an amputation scene that will give you chills) and still be effective, despite the hokey plot elements.

3343258,5,B0013FZUQA,"A group of vacationers coming across a recently discovered ancient Mayan temple in the heart of the Mexican jungle is the basis for ""The Ruins"", in which long-dormant deadly plants are awakened and create the menace for what might turn out to be the best horror movie of the year.  Killer plants have been used periodically in horror movies, sometimes successfully (the demonically-possessed woods in ""The Evil Dead"", for example), but more often not.  What's more surprising than the success achieved in The Ruins is that the angle is played 'straight', with a seemingly non-supernatural origin and a level of believability that one probably wouldn't have predicted.

  A group of two young couples at a Mexican resort meets and becomes friends with a German archaeologist (or it may have been an anthropologist, I can't remember) who's planning to embark the next day on a trek into the jungle to meet up with his brother and the brother's research partner, who've uncovered some old ruins.  Looking to add something different to their vacation, the group joins up with their new friend and his guide and takes a jeep into the wild.  At this point, no one in the party has any reason to suspect that the ruins are anything more than what they seem to be - an interesting find of ancient buildings out in the jungle.  Upon arriving at their destination though, things soon change.

  Once inside the clearing, they're surrounded by jungle-dwelling locals who seem terrified of the temple but who refuse to allow them to leave the clearing once they've entered it.  Upon making their way into the ruins in search of the pair who was supposed to already be on-site but appear absent, the real horror begins.  Something deep under the surface has awakened and is getting stronger after centuries of dormancy.  The things this movie does with the plants and the ruins are just too good to give away in a write-up; suffice it to say that there are some freaky, seriously frightening things going on.  Innovative, gorgeously photographed and emotionally powerful, with some cool sexy parts and occasional, highly effective moments of viciously gory carnage, it's a shame that this movie seemed to fly under a lot of people's radar.  It's unquestionably one of 2008's best, and one of the year's best ensemble casts to boot.  A definate horror must-see.",1217376000,,2347,4.9012658227848105

Especially if they venture off to an uncharted archeological dig in a remote Mexican jungle with a perfect stranger that offers to be your guide...and by the way, you'll help him look for his brother who went missing at the site of the dig. Nothing to be worried about there, right? Sounds perfectly safe, huh? You'd immediately agree to such an excursion without a second thought, no?

Um...no.

If you can get past the above stretch of the imagination, you'll have no problem with The Ruins, its malevolent vegetation and seemingly an entire village that protects it.

3343270,3,B0013FZUQA,"Scientists have theorized that there are certain extinct plant life that can possibly induce partial mind control through their spores. They can cause anxiety, paranoia and fear to protect themselves from predators. Fossils have been found to support these theories and some plant life are even believed to be meat eaters and is capable of attracting prey. One plant that still exists today is the ""Venus Flytrap"" which is a predatory plant, so what do you think the possibilities are for a supposed extinct plant life to be able to prey on human beings?

THE RUINS is a film freely adapted from the novel by Scott Smith (Sam Raimi`s A Simple Plan), who is also responsible for this film's screenplay. Director Carter Smith is at the helm of this fright flick and he doesn't shy away from giving us a straight-forward monster film. Oh, yes, in some ways, ""The Ruins"" is a monster film but it also doesn't forget the horror of human nature.

Four college students (Shawn Ashmore, Jena Malone, Jonathan Tucker and Laura Ramsey) are on vacation in Mexico, a long week of margaritas and white sand beaches. When a German tourist (Joe Anderson) mentions a site where an ancient Mayan Temple stands, the foursome decides to get away from all the fun stuff and embark on a little adventure a day before they have to leave. Once the group arrives at their destination, they find that they are not welcomed by the local townsfolk and ends up being trapped on top of the temple. Little do they know that the angry locales and potential starvation are the least of their worries as the flowers and vines almost have a mind of their own--and they have a taste for human blood.

Murderous flowers. Sounds real campy doesn't it? Well, the movie has a lot of flaws from the get-go with a script full of clich, stereotypical characters, some nudity, the cast goes to secluded spot and nasty townsfolk traps them in a scary situation. The film does give off a lot of bad impressions that would cause us to roll our eyes immediately. The movie's set up is definitely unoriginal that it gave the impression that here's just another horror film that it doesn`t stand out. It would take some patience in order for one to at least see its good moments.

The film is more on cerebral torture and the sense of dread. Human nature is also displayed as embodied by the scared townsfolk that they would do anything to keep whatever it is they fear secluded and quarantined than to try to understand the problem. The way that the director displays the feeling of dread and mental torment is by having our protagonists knife their own flesh to keep the vines from invading their bodies. Yes, blood and gore is omnipresent as these group of young people even perform an amputation with a steak knife that shows the gory details.

The performance of its cast is a mixed bag. But Stacy (Laura Ramsey) does somewhat grab the spotlight as the only character who truly experiences the full assault by the killer plants; physical violation and paranoia is experienced head on by this girl. The film relies on displaying visual gore instead of the usual emotional hysteria. With its visuals, the blood and gore gives an uneasy feel, and they serve as the film's saving grace. The resulting self-inflicted despair and the panic from the vines is quite intense. It is rather frightening to have a `thing' invading your flesh to breed in your body. It also emphasizes the feeling of being trapped and underestimating nature itself. The scenes are reminiscent of the movie ""Cabin Fever"".

Unfortunately, after it achieves ""shock value"" through its sequences of human torment and the pain inflicted both psychologically and physically, the film becomes predictable again. The movie has already disconnected itself with its stereotypical characters and what makes it worse is its predictability near the climax. The proceedings had already displayed potential but it decided to go for the usual histrionics. The film should have also given more character development (ahem) to our ""green"" antagonist. The townsfolk seem to be a minor plot device to get everything going.

""The Ruins"" is not by any means a bad movie. The film did manage to generate a feeling of dread and emotional torment that kept me interested for the most part. It is a little better than fair but comes a little short of being `good'. It is a modest attempt to emulate raw human horror and a lot more decent than the recent Hollywood remakes that has plagued us of late. It did manage to generate a feeling of claustrophobia and panic but its formulaic approach just kills whatever it manages to bring into bear. ""The Ruins"" isn't a total ""ruin""; it's just rather uneven and forgettable.

Although quite faithful to the book (Smith also wrote the screenplay), the filmmakers seem more interested in seeing how graphic they can get with the leg amputations and self-mutilation scenes. There are a few good creepy moments, like when the girls discover that the cell phone ringing is something else entirely, but those moments are rare. The acting is good and the sets are impressive but the movie isn't scary, which is what the main premise of a horror film should be.",1216857600,3,628,4.718181818181818

Get The Descent and never buy this movie. You have been for warned.",1216857600,,496,4.221052631578948
3343273,3,B0013FZUQA,"The trailer for the Ruins grabbed my attention, with the combination of a Mayan temple in what appeared to be a ""Descent"" type setting.  Seeing how much I enjoyed the Descent and how clever and original of a horror film it was in recent years, I thought I would give this a try, little did I expect what this film really focused around.  While there is a Mayan temple and a bit of exploration inside its dark & creepy interior, most of the film actually takes place ""on top"" of the temple.

The Ruins begins with a group of teens on vacation (big surprsie) who meet up with another group of young guys who ask if they want to tag along to a site of an old Mayan temple.  Once there, the group if surrounded by angry natives who set up a kind of quarantine camp, and will not hesitate to shoot anyone who leaves the site.  The group is thus trapped and spends the remainder of the film figuring out how to survive and how to get help, all while slowly dying off one by one (just like any horror film).  Though I keep saying horror, the Ruins is hardly that.  While there were maybe two moments I jumped off my seat, for the most part (which is typical of horror films these days) the focus remainds on grisly scenes of gore.  Makeup was done well, and scenes a-plenty will make you squirm, if nothing else, an unforgettable scene of cuting off one's legs with a mere hunting knife.  Unfortunately, I couldn't take the wild plant too seriously, however, the damage it causes to its victims you can take seriously when you see the results.  The ending disapointed slightly, ending too abrupt and without much satisfying, but that too seems to be becoming more of a constant these days in the genre.

Overall I'd say this is worth checking out.  There is some originality, but not too much as the film seems to borrow ideas from already established horror films.  Though not truly scary in the classic horror sense, if you are into getting creeped out by intense gore, Ruins should safice, however, it is still mediocre compared to films like Saw, Hostel, or Inside.

Maybe I'm just not doing my homework, but it seems to me like, recently, writers/directors of ""scary"" movies have decided that what is really, truly scary is simply being scared.  In other words, forget the actual concept of horror, let's not go to the trouble of coming up with a creative and unsettling premise.  Let's just come up with a bad guy, toss him (or her, or it) some victims, and have the poor, doomed dopes get batted around for an hour and a half.

THE RUINS and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strangers/dp/B00005JPSB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strangers</a>&nbsp;are two remarkably different films in tone, pacing, style and substance, but at their core, they are both dismally, lamentably alike.  Both of them wholeheartedly believe that if they can scare the characters in their films, then that is the exact same thing as scaring the audience watching those characters.

THE RUINS will attract more viewers, but only because it's gorier.  It wears its blood on its sleeve, let's say.  Based on Scott Smith's flawed and overlong&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/0307389715/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>, the movie takes the only thing about the book that worked -- the character development -- and completely tosses that out the window.  What you're left with are six carbon copy twenty-somethings (yes! younger viewers, there IS gratuitous nudity, and boy, is it gratuitous!) who must fight against an insidious force that dwells among them!

I'm just kidding.  I lifted that last line from the book jacket.  They don't fight the insidious force.  They just fight each other.  Aside from some squeamish bits involving legs and the threat of sepsis, the only thing about the film that's supposed to be scary is the fact that the ""insidious force"" takes its sweet, sweet time killing the vacationers when, by all accounts, it could've obliterated them within minutes of their arrival.  But, see, that wouldn't be scary, would it?  Eschewing even the tiniest shred of plausibility that would make it endurable, THE RUINS artlessly banks on the concept that watching a cat toy with a mouse is a riveting, suspenseful and horrifying experience.  When, in fact, you eventually just yell at the cat to eat the poor thing already.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strangers/dp/B001D2WU9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strangers</a>, with its Hitchcockian patience and unsteady uncertainty, makes a bit more sense in this score.  A young couple returns from a wedding to a summer home, only to be terrorized all night by three masked intruders.  Just like THE RUINS, the ending is forcasted from the opening credits.  Unlike Scott Smith's movie, however, THE STRANGERS's devious devilry makes a bit more sense, considering its source.  After all, humans are more likely to thrive off of the power-trip of terror than vines.  (Whoops.  I think I may have just given away the secret of THE RUINS.  Ha ha.  I'm just kidding.  THE RUINS has no secrets.)

Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman (or, as I like to call them,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aerosmith/dp/B000068QZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aerosmith</a>'s Daughter and That Guy From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Felicity/dp/B00005JLJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Felicity</a>) as our estranged and horrified young couple, do a pretty good job of making us feel their fear, but the movie still falls flat in the usual places.  Characters fail to believe anything odd is going on until it is Too Late.  The victims make the obligatory Dumbest Decision Ever (""Let's split up!"").  And, of course, just like THE RUINS, the movie is only as scary as the Bad Guys are deliberately and gratuitously trying to be.  (No, younger viewers, the ""gratuitous"" in this case does not involve nudity.)

I've always been a fan of scary movies because of the primal reaction that terror engenders in me (and in most people, I think).  In that sense, I can empathize with the poor, clueless cannon fodder that get chewed and abused in both of these films.  But empathy, as necessary as it may be for horror films, will only get you so far.  After all, I am entertained by fear only as long as I feel that fear.  I don't get my jollies watching other people get scared out of their wits.

But if you do?  Well, now you know what to watch.",1216771200,,4690,5.545070422535211

It was definitely original, and for a movie that, by the cover and title, looked to be low-budget, it did have a rather convincing character line-up.

How do you make a horror story in broad daylight, atop a pyramid? This is how. It's claustrophobic and this is emphasised by the brilliant use of widescreen.

I'm not sure about the premise of the plant life and the end is formulaic - no-one here gets out alive. You do get a choice of endings to sweeten things up a little.

3343278,2,B0013FZUQA,"Taking Spring Break in Mexico, four college kids hook up with a couple of European tourists and embark on a trek to an ancient pyramid in the interior jungle. A bus drops them in a small village where they try and hitch a ride with a Mexican man who rebuffs them, advising them to stay away from the ruins.  However, he quickly relents when they flash a twenty in front of him.  At the ruins, the young people are surrounded by an armed group of Mayans who, after killing one of the party, force the others to the top of the pyramid, where they spend the remainder of the movie being menaced by an intelligent, man-eating vine.

I didn't love the bestseller by Scott Smith, and, even with some significant changes, the movie doesn't improve upon the novel.  Director Carter Smith presents some nice views of the Mexican coastline, but does little to enliven his characters or generate much interest in their fates.  It doesn't help that the movie starts very slowly, and that the action is confined to a relatively small space.  Instead of playing on the character's paranoia and the audience's feeling of claustrophobia, Smith throws on gore and hysteria, which, oddly, makes the film seem flat and lifeless.  I don't have a problem with gore if it's necessary to advance the plot, but gore for gore's sake doesn't cut it--it's a cheap ploy, a last resort when creativity is limited.  When we see the gore here, it's just gratuitous; there is no real buildup of tension leading up to it, no suspense, and we don't really care about these characters because they're not close to believable. It's not necessarily the fault of the actors; the roles are seriously underwritten.  The book never really fleshed them out either, which, I think, interfered with its effectiveness.  As the film's nominal hero, Jonathan Tucker does his best in the role of a med student.  Tucker's actually quite a good actor, but he's wasted here.  Jena Malone, known for better performances, plays his girlfriend with a whininess that quickly becomes annoying, but when you have a part like this, one that doesn't offer much to begin with, you have to do what you can.  Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey, as the other college couple, are both photogenic and athletic, and their performances hint at the true talent that they'll hopefully be able to exhibit in future films.

I'm giving this film two stars because of the cinematography, and because, as bad as this film is, there are even worse (much worse) films out there that are truly deserving of a lower rating.",1216166400,2,2541,4.732426303854876

Once there, they unintentionally step onto the vines growing on the ruins. The locals show up and refuse to let the travelers leave, quickly causing them to retreat to the top of the ruins where the bad events commence. The forced isolation causes the characters to become less rational. The ending is predictable but the alternate ending was better.

I have not read the book but have gathered enough info about it that some evidently important details were left out of the movie. Okay, for the movie: well shot, some beautiful scenes, moderate amount of tension, scare factor was low for me, and the best performance is by Laura Ramsey. The ""bad guys"" are the unassuming plant life vines coating the ruins which is a bit disturbing. The performances are limited (especially Eric's {Shawn Ashmore}) and the characters are flat with the exception of the breakdown of Stacy (Ramsey). For the most part, the gore in the film is actually well done and the injuries are largely caused by the main characters rather than the vines which are basically reactionary like a venus flytrap... rather cool.

The Unrated DVD is well nothing special. Limited special features including the building of the set, art departments creation of the vines, effects on the blood & gore, and the commentary.

3343281,4,B0013FZUQA,"""The Ruins"" is a film adaptation of the popular Scott Smith novel of the same name.  Released in 2006, it was the author's follow-up to 1993's acclaimed ""A simple plan"".  As such, The Ruins came in with a lot of hype, and a few gushing reviews notably by Stephen King.  But despite the fact the book has sold a great amount of copies, it has also been victim of some lashing critical ire, especially here on Amazon, where there are countless extremely negative reviews of the book due to its pacing, supposedly annoying characters and length.  This movie adaptation attempts to mostly use the overarching concept of Smith's novel and deliver suspense in a tight, filler-free 95 minutes of running time.  For the most part, it succeeds.

The film follows the travelling exploits of 4 vacationing college students who are in Mexico on an all-inclusive resort for some much needed rest, relaxation, and some partying thrown in for good measure.  Times are good, and with only 2 days left of vacation time, they meet a young German traveller by the pool who tells them about a Ruin temple, off the beaten path that is supposedly tourist-free and would make a great one-day trip.  The 4 take him up on the offer and despite the warnings of a couple of locals who say it's ""bad place"", they hire a villager to drop them off into the remote spot.  Once they get there however they soon discover that there is a very good reason why these Ruins are so isolated and off the beaten path.  Let the horror begin...

I found ""The Ruins"" to be an extremely effective horror film and somewhat unique within the horror genre.  Of course, the ""young people vacationing in a remote spot"" has been done tireless amounts of times but the approach is somewhat different here.  Instead of the travellers enjoying their spot and slowly realizing something is wrong, terror escalates from the first minute they are there.  From then on it never really lets up.  Also, this film is quite unique in the sense that the horror and physical violence is all self-inflicted.  It begs to ask the question:  What is more horrifying than having someone slash you with a knife?  Answer: Having to slash yourself with a knife!  Slowly, methodically and deep into the wounds.

There were unbelievable scenes of gore in the unrated version that I watched.  Me and my 2 brothers are both horror vets and somewhat immune to on-screen violence but there were several scenes here that had us cringing and that we found difficult to watch.  I haven't read the novel this was based on so can't really compare the two but I can safely say that the movie suffers from none of the pacing issues and overwhelming amount of character development that the book supposedly suffers from.  Highly recommended!!",1215907200,,2757,4.709812108559499
3343282,3,B0013FZUQA,"I've seen far better horror films, such as The Descent and both the American and Japanese versions of The Ring/Ringu, but The Ruins isn't all that bad either.
It's got the usual recipe for disaster:  young people in an unfamilar place, bored, looking for fun and adventure, making silly mistakes that get them into a terrible and tragic situation.  This one happens to involve some ancient ruins, a hostile tribe that won't let the youngsters leave the ruins, and some rather creepy and dangerous foliage.
I should warn you that this unrated version gets quite bloody at times, but that's to be expected.
Don't pay too much to rent it, but if you and your friends like some bloody fun that doesn't tax your brain too much, rent this.",1215820800,,733,4.674418604651163

Once they get there they find nowone but locals who will not allow them to leave under threat of death. They friends soon find that the locals are afraid of something evil, something living in the ruis or perhaps the ruins spirit itself.

The whole concept of man eating ancient plants covering a Mayan temple is captivating. I will admit that there were a few times that it became gruesome and I closed my eyes but I really did enjoy the movie.

3343288,1,B0013FZUQA,"'Little Shop of Horrors' meets a big budget 'Blair Witch Project' without the music, without the laughs (intentional laughs that is); it does have horror, but it's so contrived and pushed in your face that it loses any reality quickly.

Stephen King raved about Scott Smith's story.  I agree he's a good writer, but I'm surprised he wrote the screenplay for this mess.  I could care less about the characters; I started to root, so to speak, for the plants.  In one part, the shrubbies started to carry off chopped body parts, and the remaining actors had to emote to it:  Look down, look shocked, really shocked, don't laugh.

The jungle, Maya-type scenery is nice(thus 1 star).  The seemingly, crazy locals yelling and shooting arrows, Phhhitt!, into people was somewhat scary, I guess, the first time they did it.  The ending fizzled to dud speed- maybe one of them got away to the rest of the world- ooh, I'm going to lose sleep on that.

Skip this one.  Go find a cheesier, campier, cheaper, a thousand times better, creepy flick and grab onto someone's arm because this one's going into the mulcher.  I'm on to greener pastures.",1215561600,2,1134,4.7055837563451774
3343299,3,B0013FZUQA,"How could you discribe a movie like ""The Ruins""? Easy, get some ditzy collage kids looking for fun in ancient Mexican ruins, get stranded, and killed by plants.

 ""The Ruins"" spawned from its' 05 book brother named as such. You know how some of your favorite books marinate in time to change into something even better? Well, Ruins comes to dissapoint. It suffers from the 'poor directon' syndrom. Not saying that Ruins is bad, but some scenes felt drawn out, or just plain silly, such as the plants I've mentioned earlier. Mabey some ideas sound better on paper(or in a book, but thats kinda the same thing), I dunno, but seeing one of the protagonists cut herself because a flower told her to just seems a little abstract. Stranded teens isent a fresh idea at all, and the quality gets dowsed even more once you see ivy(main villian?) shaking-like-a-salt-shaker while laughing. Like I've said before, it's just not ment for a movie.

 But for every con, there should be a pro, right(I think it's vice-versa)? Ruins puts a splash of origonalitly in it. Since it is a stranded teen film, there is no crazy killer stalking them. A trait that eludes most modern horror flims. Wiggly, squerming viens jiggling inside hot girls kept my intrest for a while. Add that with the extra human gore and beautiful rain forrest platues ""The Ruins"" into a decent film, so it deserves a decent score.",1215475200,,1385,4.710743801652892

I looked forward to this movie with great anticipation along with a hint of pessimism. The old cliche of the ""book is always better than the movie"" holds true in this case HOWEVER, I was not disappointed in the movie at all. It was entertaining and as true to the book as it could be in the time constraints it had. The book is much creepier and you ""buy-in"" and get more emotionally involved in it but that's what books are good at. I loved the book and liked the movie.

3343303,2,B0013FZUQA,"Lets get things straight, the ruins is a silly movie and has no right to work on any artistic level whatsoever, however the film makers have managed to squeeze an ultra flimsy plot into a 90 minute movie and it's not all bad. What you basically have is your teens in peril movie mixed with some over the top and i must say well done grue & gore, throw in some nasty mexican locals and a bunch of man eating vines and you get the picture, yep, vines? no monsters, no stalk and slash, some vines, and these plants can talk aswell. The cast do there best to keep a straight face throughout the proceedings whilst limbs are lopped off and body parts get invaded ala 'evil dead' style and there's a great scene involving a ringing mobile phone and the introduction of the plants that is well set up and eerily done. Overall it's a polished hollywood b movie horror that probably wouldn't have been made had they had any other more interesting ideas over the production table, if you like gore then it's got enough to keep you entertained, if you want a solid thought provoking modern suspiria then avoid at all costs.",1215216000,2,1112,4.429268292682927
3343304,3,B0013FZUQA,"Overall good horror movie, for the most part the characters behaved how
actual people would, which is all I ask for out of any movie. There
were only a few exceptions:

--When Jeff chased Amy down the temple as she tried to go for help,
he's sitting there trying to reason with her, pleading for her to come
back up so she doesn't get shot. Unrealistic. If that's your loved one
doing that, you YANK and physically snatch that person and drag them back up the temple.

--Same thing with the other guy and his girlfriend. When they came out
of the tent and saw the girl with the knife cutting herself, you don't
try to reason with someone who's obviously irrational and not in their
right mind. You don't slowly walk towards them casually, only to be
stabbed, you walk CAUTIOUSLY towards them, then get in position to
tackle her, and restrain her knife wielding arm. They both
approached facing her back side, so they had plenty of opportunity to
perform to subdue her without drawing aggro.

--I thought this had very good acting in it, surprisingly, even by the
girls. I haven't seen much of Jena Malone, but at least here she did a
great acting job, which makes her all the more hotter to me. Usually in
a horror movie I'm wishing for maximum pain to be inflicted in the
shortest amount of time to the beautiful, non-acting, bimbo sluts in
the movie (and I don't mean quick and painless and let's move on, I
mean shortest amount of time as in having the pain and death images
begin as quickly as possible on the screen for me to see).",1214611200,,1536,4.420494699646643

This movie contains the best performance in a horror movie since the descent and the characters are likeable. The gore is definetly there and it is used wisely. The movie is very original and twists things up from the book but its a worth the watch and horror movie lovers will enjoy this. The Ruins is really a piece of work and the best thing is that it is original and keeps u on the edge of your seat.

Your pulse quickens as these petulant, spoiled twentysomethings find themselves embroiled ever deeper in a nightmare from which they can never emerge.  The movie, with its brilliant blue skies and gorgeous cinematography, lays bare the idiocy of the story, which at its best is in fact a well-paced sci-fi horror book, truly beyond description - and obviously beyond believability.  Here on the big screen, with barely average actors, there are virtually no thrills beyond those which are placed there (cue the music; see the evil malicious vine dart up at the screen 3-d style! Scream!).  The new Hollywood ending is laughable - it is a naked attempt to cash in on a quick sequel (please spare us).

Sadly, the choices were very limited and I wasn't sure what to see so I read the blurb about each show outside the theater. Pathetically, that failed to describe this horrible excuse of a movie in enough detail - I've always been interested in ancient American history and thought that a movie about a Mayan pyramid might be interesting. How wrong I was! Without question, ""the Ruins"" is the worst, and I mean that literally, movie I have ever seen. Why I didn't walk out, I don't know. In addition to the horrible amount of blood and gore (enough blood was lost to have filled the world's blood banks for the next decade), the script can best be described as asinine. At least Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was intended to be a spoof - in comparison, this hideous film looks like an attempt to turn Killer Tomatoes into an art film.

Update: Even though I just posted this review, I've just discovered that all of the local theaters have yanked this from their offerings - at least others won't be subjected to it now.",1209081600,5,1088,4.412935323383085

Once there, they are surrounded by the locals wo make it clear that they will kill them if they try to leave.  They head up to the top of the pyramid with their meager supplies to figure out what to do, but soon find that the villagers below are the least of their problems.

""The Ruins"" is a great horror story of survival.  Death lurks on top of the pyramid for the characters, and is very much a character itself.  The sense of having no way out permeates the film.  Adapted by the author himself from the great novel, Scott Smith has rearranged the kills and story elements to keep everything fresh for the readers of the book.  Despite that, the film is faithful to the spirit of his book.  The cast effectively handles the mental deterioration that their characters endure.  The film is tense and suspenseful and one of the better horror movies to come out in the last few years.  I recommend this film.",1208995200,3,1255,4.603603603603603
