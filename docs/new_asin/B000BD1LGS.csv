2) ""The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal"", a 1980s' documentary on Pal's life and career.
3) ""The Great Rupert"" (1950), a family comedy starring Jimmy Durante and a squirrel (both real and in stop-motion animation by, of course, Pal).",1265155200,2,344,5.160714285714286
8085252,5,B000BD1LGS,"As a boy growing up in Southern California in the 1950's, I thrilled to the ""space stories"" of George Pal:  ""Destination Moon""; ""The War of the Worlds"" (watched on the huge screen of a drive-in cinema); ""When Worlds Collide""; and ""The Time Machine"".  I also saw some of George Pal's memorable puppetoons on television, for example,""Tulips Shall Grow"" and ""Tubby the Tuba"".  So it was with keen anticipation that I ordered ""Flights of Fantasy.""  I was not disappointed.  The documentary was lovingly made by people who knew and worked with George Pal, such as Ray Harryhausen and Chesley Bonestell, and who discussed not only his career, moving from early stop-motion animation in Europe to classic science fiction and fantasy films, but who also recalled him as an unfailingly courteous, kind human being.  The ""Puppetoon"" movie, which is the second disc of the package, is sheer delight, linking together some of George Pal's most impressive, funny and heartfelt animated shorts.  I recalled the screwball invaders of Holland in ""Tulips Shall Grow"" clearly across almost 60 years, when I first viewed it on television.

I have not yet watched ""The Great Rupert"", which is the third disc in the package, but I look forward to seeing it for the first time.

I higly recommend this package set to all admirers of George Pal and his cinematic achievements.  It's a must!",1261872000,2,1367,4.956140350877193
8085253,5,B000BD1LGS,"First-Thanks to cartoon expert and great guy Jerry Beck for alerting cartoon fans to this box set on his websites.

Second-If Amazon is combining the FLIGHTS of FANTASY box with the PUPPETOON MOVIE or THE FANTASTIC FILM WORLD OF GEORGE PAL at a sale price,be forwarned:the FLIGHT OF FANTASY box includes both DVDs along with Pal's first feature film,THE GREAT RUPERT.

Others have said nice things here about Pal and the FANTASY FILM WORLD documentary-suffice it to say that without George Pal there would be no STAR WARS,no E.T.,no TOY STORY and a slew of other pop culture icons.

My childhood was filled with the works of George Pal and I didn't even know it. From the Puppetoon ""Tubby the Tuba"" to the live action 1960 film,many a sit on front of the TV on Saturday morning or the movie theater on a Saturday afternoon was filled with the magic of George Pal.

My list of children entertainment hereoes would include Walt Disney,Jim Henson,Bob Clampett,Tex Avery,Friz Freleng,Chuck Jones and Max Fleischer. But George Pal might take the crown. He influended my love of music with Tubby and laid the seeds for  a positive vision for mankind in his interpretation of H.G. Well's TIME MACHINE. Like the others mentioned above,he never talked down to me as a child and yet his stories resonate with powerful images in my adulthood. I think all of these artists were their own best audience and if they liked what they created,well,the audience came along for the ride.

Of particular interest to cartoon fans is The PUPPETOON MOVIE disc in general and the extras in particular. There are 12-count 'em-12 complete and unedited Puppetoons added to the disc,with their original titles where available. Such a feast for the eyes! Some of these were made as one reel commercials for Philips electronic producats(radios and light bulbs)that were shown in European movie theatres during the 1930s. Pity the feature film that followed one of these ""commercials"",especially if it was a musical. I suspect even Busby Berkeley dropped a jaw at the images that Pal lovingly filled the screen. Colors,sound,movement-all swirl in your head and await another go round. I promise you will watch thiese short films over and over with amazement. George Pal loved his work and had high hope for mankind-not a bad way to go through life. Important lessons to be learned from a shy little tuba.",1138579200,15,2373,4.905236907730673
8085254,5,B000BD1LGS,"Whether you are a Sci-Fi fan or not, buy this DVD ! The star line-up of actors, writers, and directors explaining their parts in the various films outlined is worth the price of addmission. You'll be surprised-and perhaps amused-at some of the faces, and the films they worked on. But be warned: You'll want to race right out and buy everyone of George Pal's films after you view this great DVD. Hats off to Arnold Leibovit.",969494400,13,424,4.592105263157895
8085255,5,B000BD1LGS,"The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal is truly worlds of wonder!  Arnold  Leibovit, producer of this marvelous documentary, has done a wonderful job  at encapsulating the colorful life and career of producer/director George  Pal - from his meager beginnings as a cartoon artist, through his years of  creating the stop-motion animated short films, fancifully named  ""Puppetoons"", and into his wonderful works of feature motion  pictures.  The documentary guides us with affection through Pal's career,  by way of interviews with the cast, crew and peers of his films, and  includes interviews with Pal himself.  His work touches a cord within all  of us - the child that lives within and is dazzled by science and fantasy,  prophetic visions and flights of fancy.  All who have known or worked with  him remember Pal with delight - ""He was a sweet, sweet man;  ...a  gentle man."", as Tony Randel puts it when telling of his experience of  working with Pal.  This was a sentiment felt by all who have had the honor  of knowing and working with Pal.  This documentary thoroughly captures the  whimsy and kind heart of a man who not only was a dreamer, but was one who  inspired us to dream.  People like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg only  stand on Pal's shoulders, and continue the line of imaginative filmmaking  which he started.  The contemporary term ""eye candy"" can so  easily be applied to this documentary, for it is a treat to see this  montage of works by the master that started it all.  Thanks George!  And  thank you Arnold Leibovit, for giving us this special and delightful  glimpse into the life and works of a man who will never be forgotten!  The  Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal was obviously a labor of love!",969148800,16,1732,4.736486486486487
