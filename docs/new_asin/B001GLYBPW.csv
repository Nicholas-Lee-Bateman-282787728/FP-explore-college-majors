8305929,5,B001GLYBPW,"Advanced Tai Chi students practice their Push Hands in many ways. This is one of the most logical and realistic approaches available anywhere.

In this two-disk DVD set Instructor Jason Tsou shows over a dozen simple patterns that allow countless other variations. (Great, no more mindlessly repeating the same move over and over without meaning). In DVD#2 he shows realistic applications of the circles through pushes, locks and throws. He demonstrates both the circling and the entering from different Tai Chi styles. This is an excellent DVD set not only for partner practitioners but for teachers who will gain a wealth of new ways to engage their classes. A student of the famous Liu Yun Qiao, Jason Tsou brings his 40+ years teaching experience and analytical mind (a double masters in engineering and chemistry) to the often hopeless task of making Tai Chi partner skills realistic yet loyal to Tai Chi principles. He has trained military and law enforcement personnel in Taiwan and the United States.",1327968000,,1008,5.072289156626506
