5934018,4,B00EQ2KWEM,"I bought this DVD set for my dad who loves westerns. I have watched bits of some of the movies with him so far and noticed that the quality varies by movie. None of them appear to have been remastered, which can make viewing some of them on an HDTV a bit like the experience of watching a show over an antenna that's not getting a great signal (a bit fuzzy around the edges), and one that he watched suffered from poor sound quality (though for the most part, the sound on these movies from the stereo speakers of my parents' TV has been just as good as any other DVD). However, I'm satisfied with what we got for the price, and, overall, my dad seems very happy with them, which is the most important point. He even mentioned that he had already watched some movies in this set that he had never seen before, so if you are or know someone who is really into the genre and are looking for a decent, budget priced set with a lot of variety, this set should meet those needs quite well.",1404950400,31,984,4.184210526315789

5934026,2,B00EQ2KWEM,The reason I gave this such a bad rating is the awful packaging by Mill Creek. The discs are old double sided and you need a magnifying glass to read the circle around the discs to find out what number it is and the content. A few were single sided. They are just stuffed in the box making selection even more complicated. Have not watched any yet as it just arrived but not looking forward to it.

5934035,1,B00EQ2KWEM,"The transfers on this collection are the worst quality I have ever seen on DVD.  It's like a personal collection of VHS transfers of old TV broadcasts onto DVD.  All the video noise inherent in old TV broadcasts are here from audio pops and cracks and drop-out to film distortion where the analog tape didn't move as smoothly in the projector as hoped. When ""Kentucky Rifle"" starts there is even an icon that comes up at the bottom of the screen with the old fashioned headsets on either side of the the phrase ""In stereo where available"". This would only have been placed on a broadcast of the movie! It would not have been on the original film. All the movies are in 16:9 ratio, even the ones is super Cinemascope distorting the images like silly putty. The titles run off-screen and not all the action is viewable.  Not only that, they appear to have been ""edited for TV"" because some movies have sections missing...perhaps where commercials were edited out. Who knows. The bottom line is...buy better qualities of these films individually or by companies with an eye toward keeping the original films intact.",1443916800,8,1112,4.721649484536083

5934038,4,B00EQ2KWEM,"Great set if you're looking to get a large variety of westerns, from Gene Autry to John Wayne to Lee Van Cleef, all in one set for a decent price compared to what you'd spend on sets with less films.

So far the only issue I've noticed is that Arizona Days is missing about 10 minutes of the middle of the film and in a 52 minute film, there a bug chunk of the story you end up missing. Shortly after the villains are introduced is where the cut happens. The complete film can be found on the Internet Archive and I'd suggest skipping the version in this set and watching it there.

For those that just want to know what they missed, here goes. The stage show goes on a bit more while the villains leave. Shortly after that, it's discovered that the show's wagons are burning and nobody knows who did it but there are suspects. Word spread about Tex standing up to the bad guys in the theater and he receives some admiration from the sheriff and county commissioner. With the show broke from the wagons being burned, Tex needs a job. With the large amount of unpaid taxes from the villains, this leads to him being offered  a job as a tax collector, which he accepts. He rides out to visit his crush. The kid spills the beans that she got dolled up for him, which she denies. Just then, the gang rides up and tells Tex he needs to get out of town. Tex responds that he was hired to collect taxes and they need to pay up. The gang says they won't pay and give him 5 seconds to get on his horse and get out of town. This is where the film picks up again.

For the price of the set and the variety of westerns, I would have given it 5 stars but given the fact at least one film is incomplete, I have to knock it down a notch.",1430956800,9,1722,4.085798816568047
