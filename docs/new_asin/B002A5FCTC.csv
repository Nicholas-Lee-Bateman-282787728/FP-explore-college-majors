3883412,4,B002A5FCTC,"Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. has the distinction of being the only American Supreme Court justice to have a film made of his life. This film, the Magnificent Yankee, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for Louis Calhern in the lead role. By today's standards, this film is short on both action and drama, but for those who like the tone of a different era, in which a man of big ideas could have meaning and influence the course of his country, this is a film is a fine representation. The movie opens when Justice Holmes has been nominated to the Supreme Court by Theodore Roosevelt and chronicles the next thirty years of his life as he goes through a succession of law clerks, sees his friend Louis Brandeis ascend to the bench, the passing of his wife Fanny, and finally his own retirement at the age of 91. Much of the dialogue is borrowed from reported ""bon mots"" by Justice Holmes, remarks in his letters, and the occasional quote from a judicial opinion.

While it may be difficult to find a film revolving around a judge's life entertaining, this film's 80 minutes passes at a brisk pace and carries with it a style of acting that unfortunately has passed away from the silver screen. The only significant detraction that comes to mind is the virtual absence of any bonus features. Aside from a few advertisements for other films and the original trailer, the film itself is all that is present. Luckily, in this case that is enough.",1421020800,3,1454,4.592307692307692
3883413,5,B002A5FCTC,"I know that a lot of the biopics made during the 40's and 50's were very biased in favor of the main character - there is nothing against Justice Holmes in this movie.  I find it difficult to believe he lived to the age he did without making a mistake.  Having said that, I think movie is a SUPERB example of what a Supreme Court Justice should be.  He was unbiased in that his political leanings never influenced his decisions.  He worked with the other justices to get things done.  He was very aware that his position affected every facet of his life,  and that is beautifully brought out in this movie.  This movie should be required viewing by the members of the Supreme Courts, not only SCOTUS but the Supreme Courts in all 50 states.  Justice Holmes was what a judge should be!",1369180800,2,784,4.395833333333333
3883414,5,B002A5FCTC,"I saw this movie at age 14 and it inspired me to pursue a career in the law. A friend gave me this video a few years ago and I still enjoy it. It was a great film at 14 years and a great film at 55 years. Beware, if your child see it, he/she may pursue a career in the law.",1369094400,2,273,3.4193548387096775

3883418,5,B002A5FCTC,"I saw this film many years ago and never forgot it.  To a great many people, if you mention 'Oliver Wendell Holmes', these people will either say 'Who?' or 'Oh, yes.' without having a clue as to who the man really was.  Well, if you watch THIS film, you'll know and you'll never have to say 'Who?' again.

Louis Calhern plays Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes superbly, in possibly his best role.  His caring, compassion and ""his fire in the belly"" for law and justice are in truth, magnificent.  And his love for his wife, Fanny Bowditch Holmes comes through in every fibre of his being.

If you want to see an American classic, either man or film, 'The Magnificent Yankee' is the film to watch.",1278028800,5,706,4.519685039370079
3883419,5,B002A5FCTC,"Thank you again, I received my video just in time for my dads birthday.  We both sat down and watched the film that we both have not seen in such a long time.  The story of Oliver Willdon Homes is a amazing story and a piece of history that we would of missed out on if it weren't for this movie that was put together like a dream.",1252886400,,331,3.8529411764705883
3883420,3,B002A5FCTC,"Considering that ""The Magnificent Yankee"" concerns itself with one of American history's giants at the turn of the Twentieth Century it's a major disappointment.  As biography it's paper thin and the film gives little indication of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes'(Louis Calhern) judicial philosophy or temperment.  The film seems more concerned with the relationship between Holmes and his wife, Fanny (Ann Harding), which is admirable in a way but even that is treated perfunctorily.  At an 89 minute running time the film seems long.  The film can only be recommended by the delightful performance of Calhern who does his darndest to breathe life in this semi-inert material.  Noteworthy are appearances by Herbert Anderson best known from TV's ""Dennis the Menace"" and Richard Anderson from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman"".",1247702400,,844,5.363636363636363

8358968,5,B002A5FCTC,"This 1950 black and white film is a very nice warm look at the life of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (1841-1935) from the time he was appointed to the US Supreme Court in 1902 until near the end of his life. He retired in 1932 and died three years later, at age 93. While he and Justice Louis Brandies court decisions were generally overruled by the majority of justices, after a while, their views became law. The two were two of the finest minds that ever served on the Court. Justice Brandies (1856-1941, died at age 84) were very close friends. Brandies served on the court from 1916 to 1939.  There were many who opposed Brandeis because he was Jewish. The senate argued over his appointment for six months, fortunately for the USA, only 22 senators voted against him at the end.
Holmes fought in the Civil War. He was appointed to the Court by President Theodore Roosevelt. He frequently opposed Roosevelt who said he would throw Holmes out of the White House if he came there. While he was a Republican, he was so respected that the second President Roosevelt, a democrat, came to see him on the very day that the President was inaugurated as president to pay his respect.
Holmes and his wife had no children and, according to the film, treated his law clerks as his sons. The film depicts the very warm relationship Justice and Mrs. Holmes had. Very little time is spent in the film describing his court opinions or in describing why and how he was so intellectually superior. It focused more on showing that he was a very kind man..",1503619200,,1546,4.541218637992832
