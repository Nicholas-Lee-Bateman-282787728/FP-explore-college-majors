612684,3,6303128017,"This is probably the bloodiest UFC ever. Three matches had bloody endings. There were no matches that stood out. Gracie vs. Ichihara was a very boring match. There were two others that weren't too good. There were 16 fighters  in UFC II, instead of eight like in UFC I, and this made it so the first  seven matches weren't televised. Disapponting too, as it seemed there were  some good matches in those seven fights.",912297600,2,417,4.608108108108108

7842208,5,6303128017,"This early UFC is very different from the majority of what you see in the Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) world today.  Yes, it is violent and bloody.  However, if you ever wonder how MMA got to where it is today, this will explain a lot!  From this tape, you will REALLY see why 99% of MMA competitors today can grapple.  As implied by other reviewers, many of the competitors here were not ready for the competition.  This is exciting MMA.  No dull draws here!",1226707200,,455,4.357142857142857
7842209,5,6303128017,"If you want to see a UFC like they are nowadays, forget it. All this UFC is, is brutal full contact fights. Many Martial Artists threw out what they knew and relied on instinct. If you want to know how the UFC got banned from so many states, watch this!!!",1160438400,,255,4.12
7842210,3,6303128017,"The only thing the Proving Ground proved was that there needs to be either more fights or more fighters...quick matches started off the evening, but the slug fest between Scott Ferozzo and Tank Abbott was pretty entertaining...disappointing finish as Coleman wins the title of UFC 11 after there are no healthy fighters left....

UFC U.U. 2 was excellent...good to see all the superstars on one card...wish the UFC had more Ultimate Ultimates...

Good purchase overall...",1112832000,,471,5.266666666666667

7842212,5,6303128017,"UFC 2 was probably one of the more memorable early UFC events because of the brutality factor in this one.  The fighters in this one were all guts in this one and you had to expect nothing and be amazed by everything else.
This event started out with 16 (although all of the matches weren't showed) and just like the first, only 1 could walk away the UFC Champ.  The preliminary fights were shown in clips (usually of the end of the match) and after that the 4 quarter final matches, 2 semifinal matches, the final and for an added bonus, returning Champion Royce Gracie's preliminary fight.  And also there was a small vignette piece on several different styles of martial arts and their brief histories showing footage of styles like Thai Kickboxing, Judo and Jiu-Jitsu, Karate, Kung Fu and even some unknown styles of fighting like Ninjitsu and Pentsak Silat.
The fights are amazing in this one.  Everything you thought you were going to see in this one happened!  A lot more striking, a lot more technique and all in all, a lot more brutality.  Royce Gracie (Gracie Jiu-Jitsu) vs Minoki Ichihara (Karate) was actually a very good match.  Although most of it was spent on the ground, it was still a very skilled and technical match.  The first quarter match was between Johnny Mosely? (Karate) and Fred Ettish (Karate).  I won't give too much away but this was a great match.  The beating that Ettish received is still one of the most memorable matches in UFC history.  This match also proved that technique is sometimes not everything and that true fighting ability is what matters in the Octagon.
2nd Match is returning UFC fighter Pat Smith (Thai Kickboxing) and the American Ninja Scott Morris (Ninjitsu).  This was one of the most brutal matches of the night as well.  Personally, I didn't think that one person could take that many elbows to the face, temples, mouth and nose and STILL be able to get up after a match.  I have to admit again that this was another match where just because you looked good in your video promo, doesn't mean your great in the Octagon.
3rd Match was between French kickboxer Orlando Veit and Holland Jiu-Jitsu grappler Remco Pardoel.  This was a pretty good grappling match.  Although it was more or less simple on how the other opponent was defeated, it was all technique.  And the 4th quarter match saw Royce Gracie against Jason Delucia? (5 Animal Kung Fu).  A decent match.  Again, technique is the key word in this match.  You'll see!
I gotta say it, UFC 2 is probably one of my favorite events from the early UFC events and honestly, still one of my favorites in general.  This one is definitely worth picking and checking out.  Unlike some of the other later UFC events, this one isn't all a bunch of guys in ""the guard"" all fight long.  UFC 2 is a bare knuckle, full contact, brutal fighting challenge and this one became a staple of what people wanted to see  in the UFC and unfortunately it wasn't truly replicated again until UFC 6.  Anyway, check out UFC 2!",1044921600,8,3008,4.598499061913696
7842213,3,6303128017,"I saw pat smith fight and thought to myself ""jesus, he's completely devastating these guys"".  I expected to see a dynamic final between the tournament's best striker and the tournament's best grappler.  When you see the fight you'll know why I was disappointed.  Fred Ettish was laughable and the ninja looked awesome in training, but when you got to see him fight....well, you'll find out.  Muay thai, supposedly one of the most powerful arts in the world made a poor showing.  The announcers wouldn't shut up about a big jujitsu guy for the last hour of the movie even though gracie took him down no problem.
But still, this ufc delivers with devastating elbows causing crushed and bloody faces and beautifully executed submissions by some of no holds barred's dominant forces such as remco pardoel and of course, royce gracie.",1028505600,2,829,4.892857142857143
7842214,4,6303128017,"This UFC I would recommend to a first time watcher because it is entertaining and violent but lacks sufficiant technique to satisfy the trained eye. Its a 16 man tournament but you only see the last 8 plus Royces first round fight (8 fights in total). None of the fights last long and some are brutal. The Fred Eddish match is hilarious - he's the poorest excuse for a 5th dan karateka i'v ever seen. The so-called 'american ninja' was made short work of by Pat Smith. Watch out for the Pardou v Weit fight - the takedown and elbows are truly textbook style. As usual, Royces fights are standadary. He easily beats his unexperienced grappler opponents and proves that Gracie Ju Jitsu simply is the most effective style in the Octogan. If this is your firs UFC then i strongly recommend you to buy it but if your looking for more technical and skilled fights then try a different tape. Hope this helps.",997401600,4,901,4.5
7842215,4,6303128017,"The tape first tape released to the public, and probably the most popular still. I'll be honest, this is the one that hooked me. The tournament and it's rules were changed a bit, I think to make it more ""action  packed"". No rounds, no time-limit, and 16-man tourney were newer and  bolder Gracie rules to ensure Royce would walk through this weak field. The  field did lack skill, but made it up with just being tough. Fred Ettisch,  to me was a joke, he reminds me of my first Karate instructor. Fred was  outclassed and outeverythinged, but he did hang in there.......just trying  to survive. This and the Weit vs. Lucereli fight were and are fights used  by politicians and goody-goods to point out the violence behind the sport.  They were violent, but are only a reflection of how much the sport has  grown. This UFC was a great good vs. evil tournamnet, and skill and  experience proved just too much again.",963100800,,913,4.580246913580247
7842216,4,6303128017,this video is far far better than the first ufc.  this video is also the start of the legendary fred ettish fetal position.  pat smith at his finest.  i guess ninjitsu didn't work to well against him....,956188800,,203,4.4324324324324325
