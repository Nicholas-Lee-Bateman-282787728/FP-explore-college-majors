The print is not good, but i really loved this extraordinary cult f?lm. It really looks like a David Lynch film!!!",1359504000,,289,4.471698113207547

I do wish the reviews were more dependable. seems like ppl get a kick out of helping other to waste time nd fund on nothing.",1322092800,,275,4.0181818181818185
8145275,5,B000IF2KVE,Great nudity!  Thats all that matters... Dont waste your time with the other novel that reviews the film.  Lots of topless scenes make it worth the money.,1295913600,3,154,4.666666666666667
8145276,4,B000IF2KVE,"If David Lynch and John Waters had filmed a script by a totally stoned out, drunken Tennesse Williams, who was trying to combine To Kill A Mocking Bird and Elmer Gantry - Shanty Tramp might be result.

Shanty is not bad and its not so bad it good. Its just plan ole great. Dog on it! There really was some talent involved here, that must have disappeared almost instantly into total obscurity. Why didn't at least one of these folks go onto greater things?

The editing, photography, writing and acting all hit the right note. There is irony, and there is atmosphere. Did I say atmosphere? I mean ATMOSHERE! The folks in charge of lighting and photography got great realistic night time shots in every scene - long shots as well as closeups and on a shoe string budget too! Believe me this is not such an easy thing to do. The editors and or the director wove in great segues that were very well thought out. Shanty Tramp was something much more then a throw-away film to the people that made it and it shows.

Shot in black and white against a steamy rural southern town. Shanty Tramp takes place during one evening over maybe a two to four hour period. It could have almost been filmed in real time. Yet in this short time it tackles all kinds of subjects and taboos, victims, predators, drunken welfare dads, prostitution, lechery, incest, shady revival meetings, hypocritical Elmer Gantry preachers, motorcycle gangs, bar fights, beer drinking, patricide, interracial sex, annoyed southern cops and the magnificent Emily (The Shanty Tramp herself)

Also we must mention a bar room rock and roll dance - I call it the Shanty Dance - I believe Shanty performed the first version of the dance that would latter be made famous by some peanuts characters in A Charlie Brown Christmas - sorry Charley but Shanty got there first. What a dance and what a piece of music. One of the babes does an awesome twist too.

The acting is beyond superb as everyone takes their part seriously and plays it straight with lots of personality. The major part actors knew their characters - and they don't give you a moment to think you are watching actors - you only see the characters not the actors. In particular the preacher and Emily's Dad are outstanding. And the Emily herself (actress Lee Holland) - lets face it - she is the star of the show and in almost every scene - as she struts, wags and grinds her way around town and only occasionally shuts her mouth over those magnificent white choppers. Emily practically drools over every dollar she sees. Maybe I'm crazy but at the right angle Emily is not to bad to look at. That is when she is not being too serious and gives a nice big smile or when she is in a particularly lecherous mood.

And oh Lordy - the magnificent dialogue and innuendos between Emily and the preacher in the Rival tent! Just after she eyes the collection plate and licks her lips. There are so many great lines here and in the entire film that I lost count. If this film had ever taken off - there would be a half a dozen recognizable phrases now peppering the everyday American dictum.

There is a great opening sequence with The Saints Come Marching In on the soundtrack with the camera firmly planted and frozon solid on Emily's loveliest of a**. What an opening as Emily eyes every other Tom Cat up and down. You can feel the heat, smells and humidity coming out of the TV.

Now I must say that most of you"" normal folk"", (such as my wife) will absolutely hate Shanty, hate Shanty's Dad, hate Shanty's naked body, hate The the preacher, hate the motorcycle gangs clothing line, hate the town, hate the revival meeting, hate the old ladies in the rival meeting, hate Shanty's drunken Dad, hate the title of the movie, hate the crickets, hate the bare light bulbs and hate everything about this most excellent of all films and walk out on it within 10 minutes.

But there are those - and we know how we are - who will love this film so damn much it causes a pain in the gut - it might even become your absolute favorite film of all time.

So do yourself a favor and wait until the hottest, sweatiest night of the summer - grab a six-pack or a case or two, put on an old worn greasy tee and tattered boxers. Scratch your belly, pick at your ears and sit down on that hot, muggy night and let the crickets chatter through your open windows, put your best gal beside you or on your lap or kick her out of the house and throw Shanty in the ole DVD player. You'll be there - right in the middle of it - a very dark but real looking place - a place where you ought not to go and were warned against when you were a kid, but were probably interested in. Not to many films can pull this off the way Shanty does.

I give Shanty five stars not only for being one of the finest sleaziest movies ever made but also in the hopes that some company will get the bright idea to present Shanty in a beautiful pristine print as Emily herself truly deserves - but the copy here only gets two sweaty stars as the film print is tattered spliced speckled, cut up and noisy - for now its all we got - it will have to do.

Thanks Lee, where-ever you are. You were a real sport! And thanks Joe Prieto - nice job!",1267920000,4,5206,4.361197110423117

Shanty tramp is damn good!

Shanty Tramp could have been written by Tennessee Williams on  the one drunkest night of his entire life - so drunk he didn't remember writing it - and the script flew out the window and lay in the gutter for about two years - until David Lynch and John Waters found it, collaborated on it and directed it. ther is nothing like it.

Dog on it there really is so much talent here and the folks didn't even know they had it. And that talnet disappeared almost instantly into total obscurity.  Why why didn't at least one of the folks become famous or go onto greater things?

The editing photography, writing and acting all hit the right note. There is irony, there is a moral lesson, a heck of a story, and there is atmosphere - did I say atmosphere I mean ATMOSHERE!

Shot in black and white against the steamiest sleeziest of rural southern towns. Shanty Tramp takes place during one evening over maybe a two to six hour period. It could have almost been filmed in real time.  Yet in this short time it tackles all kinds of subjects and taboos, victims, predators, drunken welfare dads, prostitution, lechery, insest, shady revival meetings, hypocritical Elmer Gantry preachers, motorcycle gangs, bar fights, beer drinking, gang violence, patricide, interracial sex, annoyed southern cops and Shanty Trampism - the magnificent Emily (The  very Shanty Tramp herself)

I have to mention mention what I believe is the best bar room rock and roll dance ever filmed in black and white - I call it the Shanty Dance - I believe Lee Holland performed the first version of the dance that would latter be made famous by some peanuts characters in A Charlie Brown Christmas  - sorry Charley but Shanty got there first.  What a dance and what a piece of music.  One of the babes does a mean twist too. The camera mand truly new a good butt when he saw one.

The acting is beyond supeerior as everyone takes their part seriously and plays it straight and put in lots of personality.  The major part actors knew their characters - and they don't give you a moment to think you are watching anything other then the real characters. In particular the money hungery, lecherous preacher and Emily's drunken Dad are outstanding - this guy truly look smashed thought the entire film. And Lee Holland as Emily - lets face it - she is the star of the show -as she struts, wags and grinds her way around town and only occasionally shuts her mouth over magnificent white choppers. Emily practically drools over every dollar bill she sees.  but believe me she never over acts and does a great job. Maybe I'm crazy but at the right angle Emily is look pretty darn good too. Especially when she givess a nice big friendly regualar ole' gal smile or when she is in a particular lecherous mood.

And oh lord - the magnificent dialogue between Emily and the preacher in the Rival tent! Just after she eyes the collection plate and licks her lips.  I alsmost appear liek the tow are going to go right at it on the floor before all the  even leave the tent. There are so many great lines here and in the entire film that I lost count. If this film had ever taken off - there would be a half a dozen recognizable phrases now peppering the every day American dictum.

There is a great opening sequence with The Saints Come Marching In on the soundtrack with the camera firmly planted on Emily's loveliest of a**.  What an opening as Emily eyes every other Tom Cat up and down.  You can feel the heat, smells, humidity and emily coming out of the TV from that little southern town.

Now I must say that most of you"" normal folk"", (such as my wife) will absolutely hate Shanty, hate Shanty's Dad, hate Shantys nakedness, hate The Preacher hate the motorcycles, hate the gnag fights, hate the shanty dance, hate the town, hate the revival meeting, hate the old ladies in the rival meeting, hate the drunken Dad, hate the title of the movie, hate the crickets, hate the naked light bulbs and hate everything about this most excellent of all films and walk out on it within 10 minutes.

But there are those - and we know how we are - who will love this film so damn much it causes a pain in the gut - it might even become your absolute favorite of all time.

Scratch your belly, pick at your ears and sit down on that hot, muggy night and let the crickets chatter though your open windows put your best gal beside you or on your lap or kick her out of the room and lock the door and throw Shanty in the ole DVD player. Youll be there - you might not like being there and then again maybe its just where youll wan to be - but you will be there in that town - bar fighting and carousing around - not to many films can pull this off.

I give Shanty five stars not only for being one of the most perfectly pulled off movies but also in the hopes that some company will get the bright idea to present Shanty Tramp in a beautiful pristine print as Emily herself truly deserves  - but the copy here only gets two sweaty, leacherous stars as the film print is tattered spliced speckled, cut up and  noisy  - but for now its all we got - it will have to do.",1267833600,2,5367,4.344344344344345
