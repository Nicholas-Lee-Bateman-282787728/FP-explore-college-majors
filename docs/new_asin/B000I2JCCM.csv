8143576,4,B000I2JCCM,"An excellent array of guitar-tapping techniques. The teacher in the DVD is very informative on every lick he teaches. If you are interested in learning how to perfect your tapping techniques then this is an excellent resource. The DVD disc is bit on the cheap side however and there is no accompanying booklet or tabs on the video, but it is still worth every dollar when it comes to the techniques you will learn.",1195776000,2,414,4.608108108108108
8143577,5,B000I2JCCM,"I got this dvd at the first of the year in 2007, and I was a bit suprised at what a great teacher Stuart bull is. I have been playing guitar now for 3 years and I am always picking up new ideas and techniques. Not trying to take anyone's identity or style but just observing what has been demonstrated in the past. This dvd has many different two handed finger tapping techniques. Some of which are less noticeable if you think about how they are done. It has certain famous players tapping styles also toward the end which I think you will find very creative. If you like classical and shredding guitar you will be happy to know there are plenty of excercises to think of. And all are not too difficult  if you just stay dedicated and practice them. A very cool way to spice up your chops with some of the slickest and smoothest tapping runs known to man. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who loves 80's metal music( van halen, white lion, dokken, satriani, vai etc..)",1185580800,2,974,4.351648351648351
