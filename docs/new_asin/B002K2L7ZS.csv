8371715,5,B002K2L7ZS,"We are a large family who'll often get disapproving sneers from passersby due to the number of children we have.  However, it is so critical that people like that come to understand that WE NEED PEOPLE!  Our children carry our nation's and our world's burdens; are loads not lighter when there are more people to carry them?  Demographic Bomb and Demographic Winter expertly make the case for why we ought not be killing ourselves off but rather be open to embracing new life.",1393545600,4,476,4.710843373493976

A good wake up!
Highly recommended.
Get it.",1357430400,2,122,4.857142857142857
8371717,1,B002K2L7ZS,"Anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of exponential mathematical functions and common sense would understand that this ""documentary"" has but a miniscule basis in fact. Although economic growth has been dependent on population growth thus far, this is clearly not a sustainable model, not for individuals, not for the environment, and certainly not for any country. If the filmmakers are worried about the economy, I would direct them to countries such as India, which has less than a third of the US' land area, but well over three times its population.

The enduring racism that was present in Demographic Winter is also present here. What they are really seeking is an increase in the Caucasian population (hardly surprising given the ethnicity of the largely vapid and hollow talking heads in this ""documentary""). Will they change their tune when the inevitable population crash happens?

In this and its prequel, Demographic Winter, the wingnuts and pundits decry governmental coercion to reduce ballooning populations. What they fail to realise (or more likely, simply refuse to see) is that we do not really have a choice, as a species. Either we reduce the population of our own accord, or nature will do it for us, through famine. I know which method I would prefer to see occur.

The film is chock full of lies and propaganda, mostly concerning Charles Darwin, evolution, Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger. They assert that responsible family planning will doom us all. As one might expect, they consistently ignore and downplay the suffering caused by large families and unfit parents. Anyone ever read Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (P.S.)? Roe vs Wade was the single greatest contributor to a precipitous decline in crime rates in the late 80s and early-to-mid 90s.

I'm glad they did not mention the mendacious and specious ""argument"" about being about to fit the world's population in the state of Texas. That's not the issue here. That's not what environmentally responsible individuals are arguing. We simply cannot sustain the current world population ad infinitum; something must give. Either we find a way to stop breeding like rabbits, or we run out of food. I shouldn't have to mention the obvious consequences of famine, war and cannibalism that will inevitably result if we take the former route. I suggest we castrate the entirety of the Quiverfuls and the Duggar Swarm at once.

The filmmakers and misinformed talking heads attempt to disprove Malthus' hypothesis about growing populations and growing food supplies. What they ignored (or blatantly refused) to mention is how technology played the most important role in feeding the world. And even still, millions are dying every year from inadequate nutrition. These people clearly are not interested in presenting fair, balanced and accurate scientific research.

Reducing the population will increase the average share of resources that each individual human (and animal) will have available to use, and will therefore benefit all of us. It really is that simple. We must stop being ""fruitful"" or we will go extinct.",1354233600,,3141,5.1976284584980235
8371718,5,B002K2L7ZS,"Arrived sooner than expected!
We have ""Demographic Winter"", so this completes the set.
This should be ""required"" watching., very revealing!!",1352678400,2,140,6.05
8371719,5,B002K2L7ZS,"This documentary gives a whole new worldview of population and the inexcusable promoting of population control.  One basic premise is that the family unit must be preserved, that is, the traditional unit of father and mother, thereby giving instruction and nurturing to children.  Another premise is that the economicaly advanced countries are producing far less children than the ones less advanced.  On a whole, humanity is simply not replacing itself.  And some think it possible to lead to humanity's extinction.  Others are a bit more optimistic.",1327708800,8,551,5.3604651162790695
8371720,4,B002K2L7ZS,"This DVD has much overlapping content with its precursor documentary, Demographic Winter.  The premise of the documentary highlights the fact that most developed countries are economically experiencing the consequences of declining birth rates below replacement rate.  Even though people are living longer, world populations are projected to plummet after 2040 with continued inaction.  Furthermore, the United Nations and many governments persist with outdated population control philosophies at the expense of human rights, and of their own economies!

The strong correlation between birthrates and economic growth is explained by numerous experts, including a Nobel Prize winning economist.  (Is it any wonder we experienced the 2008 economic housing crisis when there are fewer Generation X-ers to buy houses from aging Baby Boomers?)  The Demographic Bomb sequel ends without the proposed solutions presented in Demographic Winter.  However, the message is an important one for everyone to hear and consider.",1278374400,25,1013,5.897260273972603
