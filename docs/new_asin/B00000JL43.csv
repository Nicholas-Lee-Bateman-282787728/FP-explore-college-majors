7912481,5,B00000JL43,"Episodes 19-21 contain a rematch with Ken and Joker, the supposed death of Kenshiro, and a rebellion in Shin's city. They're really stretching it this time with the dull Garekki and Hidora battles, but things pick up after a while. While this volume may be a bit on the slow-moving side, it's still great, and the big fight is coming up next volume...",992908800,,351,4.587301587301587

7912483,5,B00000JL43,"Great set of episodes, that's all I can say, from the point where Garekki decides that lunch time is much more important than finding Ken to the final few seconds of General Barcom's life (trust me, don't blame Ken for his death, the origins are much closer). The only bad part however was the sudden feeling that the third episode was being stretched out somehow, still great ending.",988416000,,384,4.661764705882353
7912484,5,B00000JL43,"Simply awesome. The graphics are pretty old, but the voice acting and music are superb throughout the entire three episodes. The drama is really brought to life in this volume. Check out the very last few seconds of the  final episode of this tape. THAT is what did it for me. Now I simply cant  wait for volume 8. Buy this.",945648000,,324,4.295081967213115
