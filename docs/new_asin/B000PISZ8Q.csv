2823725,2,B000PISZ8Q,"My husband and I love Reno 911 the TV series, so when the movie came out, we made sure we were in the theaters opening weekend.  I have to say the movie was a big disappointment for us.  The same humor was there as in the TV screen, but it just didn't translate onto the big screen. Maybe inserting a plot into Reno 911's random off-the-wall humor slowed it down too much.",1172880000,3,372,4.152777777777778
2823726,5,B000PISZ8Q,"Familiar with the sheriff's department in Reno, Nevada? They are a fine group of individuals: well-seasoned, well-meaninged, hard working folks that protect the nighttime streets in the Biggest Little City in the country. And then the day crew shows up, Dangle and the rest, and all heck breaks loose in the town. Well, the crew has been transplanted to Miami in their newest and first feature film: Reno 911: Miami, and I'm happy to report it doesn't let us down.

Dangle and his crew have been invited to a law enforcement convention in the great city of Miami, and being the schumks they are, they board their bus and travel to it. However, due to a computer mixup, they arrive at the convention and are not registered, so they are forced to stay at a seedy motel. This sets up the scenario of the movie perfectly, as a plague sweeps through the convention and it's up to our lowly team to protect the streets of Miami.

Those of you who have seen Reno 911! before are very aware of the bawdy, slapstick brand of humor often prsented on the show. The movie banks on that type of humor and does it very effectively. On several occasions, I found myself laughing so hard that I couldn't breathe. The theater that I saw this movie in was crowded, and clearly the crowd enjoyed it just as much as I. Those people who haven't seen it might be put off a bit by the humor at first (I mean, can anyone possible explain Trudy to anyone?).

Kudos to everyone that works so hard on Reno 911 to give us weekly laughs, and for creating an equally wonderful movie experience!",1172275200,31,1564,4.461538461538462
2823727,1,B000PISZ8Q,I went blindly in to this movie. I thought oh this will be a funny stupid kind of comedy that would be fun to see. Boy was I wrong. This movie had no plot. Was gross the whole way through out. I saw everyones [...] and it was not funny. It was gross. Crude humor involving sex. I felt embarrassed that I was watching this. I wanted to leave halfway through but I stayed. Now that I saw this peice of trash I wish I would have just stayed home.,1172275200,5,443,3.933333333333333

2823729,4,B000PISZ8Q,"The dim-bulb cops of the Reno Police Department, lead by flamboyant lieutenant Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon), have been recently invited to a convention of Miami. While partying and getting dirty, they're called upon to stop recent acts of terrorism. Aided by various law enforcement figures (David Koechner, Patton Oswalt), they unwittingly find themselves butting heads with a local drug lord (Paul Rudd), reuniting with cokeheaded prostitute Terry (Nick Swardson), and getting into all kinds of crazy situations.

Combine ""Saturday Night Live"" with Cops and you get the ""Comedy Central"" cult favorite ""Reno 911!"" This Emmy-nominated, heavy-on-improv parody of the FOX reality show has garnered quite a following, starring a bevy of actors capable of laughs. Director Ben Garant (who plays deputy Travis Jr.) also is offered the chance to bring the whole gang to the big screen, as well as set their sights on wrecking havoc in the southeastern coast. Enter ""Reno 911!: Miami.""

Armed with the single-shot, Indie-patented camera shooting from the TV show, ""Miami"" does what the original does best: getting laughs. Now, on the big screen, and rated R no less, Garant takes a page from last year's success story ""Borat"" and crams the movie adaptation with gross-out gags, gratuitous nudity, and violence (some played for laughs) that will have the FCC frantic.

If there's one scene that is classic, it's 1/3 into the movie. It's where the deputies are in their hotel rooms, either masturbating or - even wilder - having sex. It's hard to find a filmmaker to have the gusto to include a scene like that in a film (well, unless it's ""Borat""), yet Lennon proves to be the right boy for the job. Besides, any scene like that is worth $5.50.

There's a bunch of other memorable gags: an ode to buddy comedies in where Raineesha teaches Trudy how to talk black (while they walk around in somewhat-skimpy bathing suits) the deputies blowing up a whale after failed attempts (including Jones falling into the whale), a guy getting ate up by a crocodile in his neighborhood pool, a SWAT leader (played by wrestler The Rock) gets blown to bits while trying to disarm a grenade, Dangle often trying to hem new outfits (he's often nude in these scenes), two of our boys crashing a hip-hop party looking for Death Row CEO Suge Knight (like that won't happen), and plenty more.

As we said earlier, the whole cast is in this film: Thomas Lennon (Lt. Jim Dangle), Ben Garant (Dep. Travis Jr.), Niecy Nash (Dep. Raineesha Williams), Mary Birdsong (Cherisha Kimball), Kerry-Kenney-Silver (Dep. Trudy Wiegel), Wendi McLendon-Covey (Dep. Clementine Johnson), Carlos Alazraqui (Dep. James Garcia), and Cedric Yarbrough (Dep. S. Jones). All are in top form, and improving like no tomorrow, even if some of the jokes are hit-and-miss (the joke about Kimball being a lesbian runs dry, and there's a slapsticky chase across a bridge).

There are also some new faces in the cast. Sure, we got some familiar faces there, such as funnyman Nick Swardson reprising his role as Terry and a brief cameo by Kathryn Fiore going from a Peace Corps rep to playing a helicopter model. But there are other surprises: producer Danny Devito as a lietenant in a dream sequence that mirrors a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, Patton Oswalt as the deputy mayor and, highlight of the film, Paul Rudd as a druglord who watched ""Scarface"" too many times. Sure, ""SNL""'s Bill Hader would've nailed the part, but Rudd's almost dead-on impersonation of Al Pacino's character from the 80's cult film gets the film's browny points.

This is a highly-enjoyable comedy. While not matching the button-pushing or gut-busting hilarity of ""Borat"", it's a nice little film that is sure to turn on a few kids to the hit Comedy Central show.",1172188800,5,3771,4.966719492868463

2823764,3,B000PISZ8Q,"Three stars because it's okay.  It's no masterpiece, though.
The Reno Sheriff's Department goes to a national police convention in Miami Beach.  Their reservations get messed up and they can't get into the convention center on day one.  While they are coping with this there's a bioterrorist attack, the convention hall is sealed off, and there are no cops in the whole Miami area except the idiots from Reno.  They get Miami Sheriff uniforms and are drafted to enforce the law.  There are good moments, such as a Tony Montana-type drug lord, an alligator in a swimming pool, and so on.  There is some nudity, which really does little to improve the comedy or advance the story line.  (After seeing Deputy Raineesha Williams in a thong bathing suit I needed a Pepto-Bismol.)

All the usual interpersonal relationships are on display, but I had hoped they might be explored a bit more in the movie.

2823782,5,B000PISZ8Q,"It's been several years since I watched ""Reno 911.""  I love the show, so I was a bit fearful the movie wouldn't live up to the show's ""standards.""  As it turned out I had nothing to fear: the zany absurdity that put ""Reno 911"" on the cutting edge of comedy is alive and well and holed up in Miami, FLA.  Anyone who's ever watched the show knows it's not your typical sit-com.  It ranks up there with ""Stella,"" ""The Kids in the Hall,"" and ""Red Dwarf"" as the epitome of sketch comedy.  It's not a ""feel good"" kind of show; it's strictly for laughs.  There's rarely a nice, neat little plot that resolves itself by show's end.  The good guys don't always come out smelling like a rose; and the bad guys don't always get their comeuppance - and that alone is a turn-off to devotees of conventional comedy: they don't get the point of a show that touches the funny-bone but not the sensibility.  A show that doesn't exalt and reinforce society's ""norms"" is incomprehensible to those who expect their sit-coms to make sense.

All the show's signature sight gags are present and accounted for, just in a different setting.  You need only read the DVD cover.  The Reno Sheriff Department gets stuck with the task of policing the entire city of Miami, without any help or any backup: there cannot be a greater recipe for total chaos.  And if there's one task Lt Dangle and his deputies are up to, it's creating chaos wherever they go. So when they actually save the day - by sheer chance, of course - they become what you might call Poster Children for Chaos Theory.

I haven't detailed any of the particular incidents in the movie because, as with the TV show, the incidents are merely backdrops to the zany, absurd way the Reno team approaches and even sometimes manages to resolve any situation.  The whale that washed up onto the topless beach, e.g., could have been anything from a conch shell to a submarine - it makes no difference: Dangle's team would have proceeded exactly the same bumbling way no matter what the obstacle was.  And that, of course, is precisely what the show - and this movie - are about.  It isn't what actually happens that creates the comedy, it's how they handle what they encounter. These are not characters who grow, or learn from their experiences.  They're essentially as one-dimensional as characters can be; so you pretty much know how they'll react to each new problem they encounter.  In a word, it's not about Who they are but What they do.  You either like that or you don't.",1364428800,2,2508,4.5456570155902005

2823789,3,B000PISZ8Q,"Reno 911! Miami attempts to take the characters of an excellent, hilarious television spoof of Cops and put them on the big screen in a movie. Unfortunately, the overall feel is that you're watching an extended episode of the TV show; and it's just not as funny as I hoped it would be. It's like being on a plane that taxis down the runway only to stop abruptly at the end, never actually taking off. Ay!

When the Reno sheriff's department is invited to a law enforcement convention in Miami, they all travel--by bus--to the city. Naturally, when they get to the convention these Keystone Cops are denied admission because ""they're not in the system."" After the whole convention of police officers becomes trapped in the center because of a biological attack, our gang from Reno turns out to be the only people who can save the day.

Look for some funny moments with several members of the Reno police force. There are a few good laughs when Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) tries to find out whose face she had tattooed on her breast one night when she was drunk; and Deputy Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash) does her best work not with spoken lines but with her ""faces."" Raineesha and Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenney) have a silly conversation while on Miami beach patrol; and Deputy Travis Junior (Robert Ben Garant) has some funny moments when he attempts to woo a young lady for some romance.

Overall, fans of the television show Reno 911! will enjoy this movie somewhat more than people who have never seen the show; but even for them there's likely to be some disappointment here. The film just doesn't work as well as it should have worked; and it's a shame that these highly talented people weren't given better material to work with.",1343952000,,1761,4.711038961038961
2823790,5,B000PISZ8Q,"I'm a big fan of Reno 911, and this movie is definitely a must see for those who love the show. For those who have not watched the television version of the show, the movie might be a little lost on them, since it references much of the material fans of the show are already familiar with. Characters such as Terry (the roller-skating guy) make appearances in the film, and without background on who they are, someone watching it would probably be confused.

The movie starts out with the group in their typical work meeting, going over all the new announcements. They find they have been invited to a conference in Miami, only to discover after getting there that no one has them listed on the guest list. Suddenly there is an issue in the city that keeps all the local law enforcement from being able to do their jobs, and the only cops left are the visiting Reno Sheriffs Department. They suite up and start doing what they do best, awkwardly patrolling the streets of the city. While they do their best, the new city is like nothing they have seen before and they pretty much mess up everything they touch along the way.

All your favorite officers are in the movie, and it plays out just a one of the TV shows, just with a much larger budget. The biggest difference between the movie and the TV show is you see EVERYTHING. Nothing is blurred out, and nothing is bleeped out. There are some hotel, night club and beach scenes with nudity and definite ""adult situations"". Also in one of the night club scenes, there is a shot of a girl getting sick. It's made to be very fake looking, but worth knowing about ahead of time in case that stuff bothers you. The graphic stuff is not overly done in the film, just the typical Reno 911 situations those who watch the show are use to.

The movie is hysterical and if your a fan of the show, you have to see the film!",1329091200,,1863,4.363112391930835

The series and the movie are daylight and dark, but the acting from the cast was never an issue.  As always, the Reno 911! cast was spot on and in character.  It was the plot far removed from the great episodes that we fans have expected.

2823794,5,B000PISZ8Q,"There is more to this DVD than first meets the eye.  Not only to you get the Digital DVD to download the movies on the DVD into your IPOD, but you also really do get a ""LOST VERSION"" of the movie!  Since all the other reviewers have chosen to review the original movie which is also on this DVD, I thought I'd give you a run down of the ""Lost Version.""  In the ""Lost Version"" there is a huge extended trip across country, where you watch the Reno Sheriff's Department stopping at a scad of different road-side attractions.  There are more scenes of everybody partying in Miami.  There is even a quasi-Lesbian scene with Wendy Covey and Mary Birdsong...but you don't see any skin and Wendy Covey leaves before anything happens.  You also see more of the ""love scene"" between Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenny-Silver.  Junior's adventures with the underage Asian girl and also covered in more depth.  I could go on and on, but to sum it up, the ""Lost Version"" is COMPLETELY different from the movie shown in the theaters or the Unrated Version (which is also on this disc.)  It really is NUTTIER and NAUGHTIER than the movie theater version (just as the DVD cover proclaims.)  It's a completely different movie! Now here's the catch.  If you don't watch the movie in the proper sequence you will keep watching the Unrated Version, which is also on this DVD!  I'm not sure if Thomas Lennon and company deliberately did this, BUT the ""Lost Version"" is HIDDEN (more or less) on the DVD.  The trick is that you go to the ""Intro to the Lost Movie"" section on the DVD Menu and click there.  Then WATCH the Intro!  Do not fast forward through it.  Watch the entire Intro and when it is done click on the ""Lost Version"" movie BENEATH the Intro.  Be warned, if you simply opt to click on the ""Watch Movie"" option, you will continue to get the original hilarious movie released in theaters and then later re-released in unedited form on the Unrated Version of the film.  So if you already have this ""Lost Version"" DVD and think you've been ""ripped off"" because the movie is the same...well...that's the orginal version on the DVD.  Remember there is a ""Watch Movie"" function which will keep on giving you the Original Version and NOT the ""Lost Version.""  Once again, in order to watch the ""Lost Version,"" you must go to the ""Intro to the Lost Version"" and then watch it, then click on the ""Lost Version"" movie to get it.  If you chose to click on the ""watch movie"" option, all you will get is the original movie.  You can tell you've got the ""Lost Version"" because it doesn't have virtually any ""Hollywood"" style music or staging.  It looks like a much longer ""Reno 911"" episode with the television-style music.  The ""Lost Version"" is actually better (at least I think so) than the original version.  According to Lennon's introduction, they really did loose this film and were forced to release the other version.  I'm not sure if this is true, but it is completely different and way more risque.  I'm probably not the only person who discovered this really cool feature which explains why this DVD is sold out almost everyplace.  Fortunately you can still get it from Amazon.com...but they are going fast here as well.  A final clue as to what the Lost Movie is like...if you watch the original movie and see all the strange outtakes at the end of the movie, like the ""Go back to Cuba"" scene...those are all originial scenes in the ""Lost Version.""  In otherwords, they really did make TWO different versions of this movie.  Whether it was by accident, (according to Lennon, they LOST the first version in the editing room) or by design, the ""Lost Version"" is definitely worth having.  You see way more of the Sheriff's patrolling Miami, and way less of the ""Drug Lord"" story highlighted in the Theater/Unrated Version.  Get the ""Lost Version"" before it disappears.  (No pun intended.)  Oh yeah...you also get to see more of Jones and Garcia in this version.  They are two of my favorite characters.  To sum it all up, the ""Lost Version"" is completely different from the Unrated Version, but it's also sort-of-hidden on the Disc.  But thanks to your's truly you now know the code to see the new one.  Remember, in order to see the ""Lost Version"" of this movie you must have the correct ""Lost Version"" DVD, which is the one advertised right here and then click on the ""Intro to Lost Version"" prompt and watch the Intro, then click on the ""Lost Version"" movie.  Then sit back and enjoy a completely different, completely hilarious different version of ""Reno 911 Miami.""",1279324800,30,4552,4.61318407960199

At no point was I wishing the scene would move on to something better.

2823799,3,B000PISZ8Q,"I must confess I have only a limited knowledge of the original show ""Reno 911!"" Actually, I have never seen it. Not a single episode. I knew the original TV series was Comedy Central's parody of ""COPS"" and that's all I knew before watching ""Reno 911!: Miami."" So read my review as such, written by a first-time viewer of the series.

What surprised me is that I enjoyed the film. The film is not perfect and its 84 minute running time is still too long, but I liked it. The story starts promisingly with the Reno Sheriff's Department officers and their mission to resolve a nuclear bomb situation (with a cameo from Danny DeVito, who is also a co-executive producer). The goofy scene is followed by another mission of them, which is even goofier - an emergency call to catch a runaway chicken on the road.

Then the entire officers are ""invited"" to the national police convention held in Miami Beach. After staying at the town's motel (shot in ""Rear Window"" style), they learn that because of the terrorist attack, the convention center is quarantined and everyone inside, including the police officers, cannot leave the facilities. This means the bumbling officers from Reno Sheriffs Department must respond the calls from the civilians and patrol the streets of the town.

As far as humor goes, the film is at its best in the earlier part. Though he appears only briefly (about three minutes, I think), Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as a SWAT agent is hilarious. As the film goes on, however, from somewhere around ""the croc in the swimming pool"" or ""the beached whale"" the jokes start to be repetitious. Paul Rudd is very funny as a ""Cuban"" drug lord (a ""Scarface"" parody), but the film's weak conclusion needs better material.

As a stand-alone comedy ""Reno 911!: Miami"" is largely forgettable, but is still good enough to get us interested in the original TV series, which I believe is much better",1252800000,2,1898,4.742424242424242

After a bio-terrorism scare, Dangle and co. find themselves as the only cops around, and end up patroling the streets of Miami.

While the film seems to be more of a mish-mash combination of skits, it works as what it is, with some off the wall hilarity that ensues among the chaos.  Most memorable is definitely the multi-hotel room look at all the officers getting some ""alone"" time, which is just too funny for words.  With cameos from show regulars Nick Swardson, Paul Reubens, and Paul Rudd; along with a very funny and short cameo from Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Reno 911: Miami ends up being a pretty funny move to the big screen that while not perfect, succeeds as what it is.",1208390400,,1148,4.575609756097561

In this case, it's the police department of Reno, NV in Miami, FL.  The police officers mistakenly believe they're invited to a convention, only to find themselves as the only police force in the city.  Sound familiar?

Certainly, the first POLICE ACADEMY was funny.  However, it didn't deserve a sequel (or about the 50 sequels it got).  Nor did it deserve a ""vicarious"" sequel in the form of RENO 911 about 25yrs after the fact.  The idea is stale and the present movie does nothing to make it fresh.

There's maybe 7 minutes worth of funny material in this film.  The cameo by The Rock was cute, and for me that was the funniest part of the whole movie (it lasts all of 3 minutes or so).  If I pick up a comedy, particularly a slapstick comedy, I want more than 7 minutes of laughter.

One of the biggest problems of the movie is its dearth of hot babes.  Having homely women trying to pass themselves off as beautiful women gets boring after about the first 5 minutes.  The 1 photogenic babe in the whole film is a topless extra who appears in the topless beach scene.  She's hot, but she can't make up the lost ground from the rest of the female cast.

In the end, the cast members of this film seem to think they're way more funny than what they are.  The best comedies I've ever seen have had actors who can make being funny look easy.  These actors struggle along, trying to ""force"" you to laugh, and in the end it just doesn't work.

2823808,2,B000PISZ8Q,"Pros:  Some funny moments and the movie truly seems like it is going to be good in the beginning.

Cons: Taking the movie away from the Cops/reality show format really makes it a lot less funny.

The Comedy Central show is funny, but this movie just doesn't deliver in the same way.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few laughs, especially towards the beginning when it really feels like the idea is going to work, but the overall plot is just not as funny as it could be, despite the fairly nice premise of the team showing up to a police convention at which they are not welcome.  The main problem is that the show got a lot of its steam from the Cops-like format which offered comedy in short, hilarious bursts.  This is not to say that it didn't have a plot, but the plot (or plots) were delivered in a rather subtle way which often, in and of itself, helped fuel the comedy by allowing jokes to be brought up again just when you had forgotten them.  The movie tries for a more cohesive storyline, but much of it is just not humorous and the time spent developing story takes away from the type of humor that Reno is good at delivering.  Even the funnier moments are usually present in subplots (such as Clementine trying to find the mystery man in her tattoo) which are paced in a way that is more similar to the show.  The actors all deliver as good a performance as possible based on this script, but this movie really should have stayed more true to its roots.",1203206400,,1467,4.305454545454546

I'm not a big fan of the TV show either, but I fail to see how the majority of the segments in this film were supposed to be funny.  It's probably just not my style of humor.  A group of cops walking around trying to kill or arrest a chicken on a street wasn't really funny to me.  A whale exploding on a beach isn't funny either.  The Rock (WWE wrestler) making a special appearance to discipline the cops and show them right from wrong ONLY to be blown up wasn't really funny to me either.

A bunch of cops sitting around in a variety of hotel rooms and ""being bad"" wasn't funny, nor was the Asian woman who kept throwing up all over the place.  The skinny teenage guy who was walking around the streets on roller skates failed to entertain me as well.  His choice of words didn't make any sense.  The guy trying to remove an alligator from his filthy swimming pool was rather strange.  The topless woman walking around on the beach was nice, though.

What I really don't understand is why this style of comedy is so sloppy all the time.  I mean, you can barely hear what the cops are saying to each other because they keep mumbling under their breath, and it's hard to make out the words they're saying.  For some reason, that's entirely okay to the producers.  Maybe this is supposed to be part of the typical ""reality television"" style, I don't know.

It wasn't fun trying to figure out what the cops were saying to each other though, nor was it funny in any way, shape or form.  Let's just say, comedy has now hit rock bottom if this show was popular enough to make a movie out of it.",1199491200,,1652,4.2300319488817895

Twenty minutes (not including commercials) of Reno 911 is fine.  90 minutes of it is unbearable.  Actually, make that an hour for me because that is as far as I got watching this movie.

911 Miami doesn't really follow a storyline per se.  Certainly not one you were likely expecting of a big screen production.  No, it really is just like the TV show but with longer, more idiotic vignettes thrown together.  I did chuckle a few times but on the whole the humor is moronic. The kind of childish humor that sends fools and children laughing when someone trips and falls.

It's like being on a plane that taxis down the runway only to stop abruptly at the end, never actually taking off. Ay!

When the Reno sheriff's department is invited to a law enforcement convention in Miami, they all travel--by bus--to the city. Naturally, when they get to the convention these Keystone Cops are denied admission because ""they're not in the system."" After the whole convention of police officers becomes trapped in the center because of a biological attack, our gang from Reno are the only people who can save the day.

Look for some funny moments with several members of the Reno police force. There are a few good laughs when Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) tries to find out whose face she had tattooed on her breast one night when she was drunk; and Deputy Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash) does her best work not with spoken lines but with her ""faces.""  Raineesha and Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenney) have a silly conversation while on Miami beach patrol; and Deputy Travis Junior (Robert Ben Garant) has some funny moments when he attempts to woo a young lady for some romance.

The DVD comes with three optional commentaries. One commentary is by the directors; and two others are by actors in the film who comment on the film as if they were the people they portray and not who they are in real life. There are extended scenes as well.

Oh make no mistake - it's still outrageously hilarious, but even extra running time and the gift of not being censored can't fully restore this to its Comedy Central glory.

The hapless Sheriff's Department of Washoe County is invited to a Law Enforcement convention in Miami. Taking a bus (yes, a bus!) across the country, they arrive only to discover they aren't located on the paperwork, and must stay at a no-tell motel with a rude, seedy desk clerk (Toby Huss, as always, perfect). Their first night in Miami doesn't quite go as well as planned, and each officer ends up, um...let's just say alone.

In the morning they arrive at the convention center only to find that ALL of the other officers have been poisoned and are under quarantine, and they are the only unaffected group. Therefore, they are the defacto protectors of Miami.

Scary, huh? There are some wonderful cameos in this movie: Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) has a small role as a SWAT agent, as well as Patton Oswalt, Mindy Sterling, Paul Rudd, and my favorite - Nick Swardson, reprising his role as Terry the roller skating hustler - in Miami to make a record.

Now the movie was funny, but you have got to do yourself a huge favor and watch the Special Features. There are Public Service Announcements that are a hoot, as well as three feature commentaries: one with several of the actors as themselves, and then two different additional commentaries with the actors playing their characters.

Also, my favorite part of movies like this is just letting the comedians loose and seeing what they come up with. The extended scenes are un-freaking-real.

2823822,4,B000PISZ8Q,"Never having seen ""Reno 911"" on TV, I really had no idea what to expect from ""Reno 911!: Miami,"" the full-length theatrical version of the Comedy Channel cult favorite.  I figured that the movie would be silly and childish to be sure - and I was certainly not disappointed in that regard - but I was definitely not prepared for just how terribly funny and utterly endearing it turned out to be.  All you overpaid writers of ""Wild Hogs,"" ""Evan Almighty,"" ""License to Wed,"" ""Norbit,"" etc, please take note:  THIS is how to make a screwball comedy.

A playful take-off on the you-are-there reality TV show ""Cops,"" ""Reno 911"" features the crazy, slapstick-ridden  antics of the most inept law enforcement agency this side of the Keystone Kops.  For their big-screen debut, these fun-loving goofballs leave their home-base in Nevada and head off to Miami for a national sheriff's convention, giving them a chance to wreak their own unique brand of havoc on the unsuspecting citizens of South Florida.

The movie is really nothing more than a series of loosely constructed comedy sketches held together by the barest outline of a story (all the cops at the convention are quarantined except for our intrepid band from Reno, putting them in default charge of all law enforcement in the greater Miami area).  But you don't really need or want much more than a barebones plot when the material is as clever, ribald and inspired as it is here.  Indeed, there's an almost Marx Brothers-like, burlesque freeform quality to the movie, enhanced by the good-natured, anything-goes fearlessness of the performers, who never balk at what they are called upon to do, no matter how undignified, humiliating or degrading it might be.  In fact, it's that high-spirited infectiousness that comes wafting off the screen and envelopes the audience in laughter.

Credit for the film's success goes to writers Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney, co-writer/director Ben Garant, and their fellow actors, Carlos Alazraqui, Mary Birdsong, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Niecy Nash and Cedric Yarbrough, lovable bunglers all who know that true comedy works only when the performers approach the material with the utmost straight-faced earnestness.  There are also clever cameo appearances by Danny DeVito, The Rock, Paul Rudd and Paul Rubens to ramp up the hilarity.

In a film year woefully bereft of humor and laughs, ""Reno 911!: Miami"" is like a life-saving oasis in a movie comedy desert.

Marvelous fun.",1188086400,9,2464,5.066831683168317
2823823,3,B000PISZ8Q,"The Reno Sheriff's Department has graduated to the big screen, and for those who love the Comedy Central TV series, you're in for more sexual innuendo, more ineptness, and plenty of pithy bathroom comedy moments you've come to expect from this unique band of brothers (and sistas!)

This time, though, Reno's finest have been invited (mistakenly) to the U.S. Sheriff's convention in Miami. All of our favorites plan to attend, too. The sashaying Lieutenant Dangle (Thomas Lennon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conversations-with-Other-Women/dp/B000T14LMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conversations with Other Women</a>) with his exceptionally tight shorts and flagging leadership. Deputy Trudy Wiegel (Kerri Kenney) and her childish IQ and confused feelings for Dangle. Deputy James Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui) and his overly protective racial-ness. Deputy Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey) and her exposed bosom that attracts men like moths to a flame. Deputy S. Jones (Cedric Yarborough), probably the most ept of the inept but continuing to fall in with this depraved crowd and, not surprising, for Clementine. Depute Raineesha Williams (Niecy Nash), a large booty woman who's attraction to Jones is never realized because he's after Clementine. Deputy Travis Junior (Ben Garant) who's only a small step up on the IQ scale from Trudy Wiegel and constantly fails to accomplish anything. And finally deputy Kimball (Mary Birdsong) who's denial of her sexual orientation baffles the rest of her department; she's tough and walks like a man.

This dangerous crew heads to Miami only to learn that they were NOT invited. Ticked beyond belief, they are forced to find lodging at a bottom rung motel. Drinking heavily and trying to fondle each other (but, failing that, themselves) the crew soon learns that a terrorist attack has taken place at the convention center, leaving them (Reno's ""finest"") as the only law enforcement folks in the greater Miami area.

Thrashing everything Miami turns out to be the best our wayward cops can do. Destroying police cars. Disabling dispatch centers. Watching citizens get eaten by gators. There's nothing their not ready to let happen!

There's a weaker subplot that unfolds throughout the story (related to the acting Mayor and a local drug czar) but it is fairly scatterbrained.

For those hoping for any type of cohesive story, you're not going to find it. It is more like a long episode of Reno 911 than a film. Short gag jokes rule, including surprise visits from characters on the TV show that popped in from out of nowhere.

It's still a damn funny film, just not as good as it could have been.",1187481600,5,2687,5.416267942583732
2823824,3,B000PISZ8Q,"I am a huge fan of Reno 911! on TV, and even tho I was happy and excited once I heard there was going to be a movie, worry soon set in. Reno is great as a little 30 minute TV show, but could it's type of comedy and mockumentary style be able to be pushed into feature length form?. Not extreme feature length form, since the end credits begin around the 73 minnute marker or so. The answer is...not really. Don't get me wrong, Reno 911! : Miami is hilarious and fun from start to finish, but after a while, the style of the TV show is wearing a bit thin for the big screen. The movie, save for the the first few minutes, is pretty much shot like the TV show, and looks like it. Our screwball cops are invited to a meeting in Miami. When they get there, they are not on the list. However, all of the other police officers(every single one of them in town)are trapped in the conference building, and our beloved goofballs are the only police officers left on the outside to protect and serve the citizens of Miami. From here on out, it's just a set up for the movie to become like the TV series, with our gang of cops going on their little jaunts and calls. Most of it is pretty funny. Pretty much everything that you liked or loved about the individual characters are here, although some of them seem to take a back seat to others. A few celebrity cameos abound thru the movie, and Paul Rudd's is the most interesting. His section doesn't always work, seems a little odd at first, but it comes out better in the end, even tho we have seen a similar situations like it on the TV show. Another big plus was including Terry in the film. He gets some of the biggest laughs. Some people liked to compare this to Police Academy 5. Unlike PA 5, Reno 911! : Miami is funny. Sometimes even gut busting funny. It's not Citizen Kane, but it looks like it compared to PA 5. This type of movie and comedy may not be for everybody. If you love the show, you will probably like it. It may not live entirely up to your expectations, but you will have a good time. If you've never seen the show, it won't matter any. Despite some characters not getting as much attention, and the joke wearing thin towards the end, the movie is still worth seeing. It's good for a number of laughs. Make sure you check out the special features, especially the longer version of Weigel and Dangle in his room, and the cops' bus ride. The last one is 22 minutes of pure hilarity.

Reno 911 the movie is a lot like the tv show in that it's very hit or miss. There are some very funny bits here and some others that are just stupid or pointless.

2823837,4,B000PISZ8Q,"Reno 911! the TV show is undeniably hilarious. I think anyone interested in watching this movie can agree on that. So it kind of makes sense that they'd try their luck on the big screen. However, how could they keep that touch of the TV show through a feature length film? They didn't.

What makes the TV show so funny is its lack of a plot. It really is just a string of clips tied together to make a 30 minute show. That works. I guess it was naive of me to expect the same out of the movie. There is a plot, and it's not completely just a string of clips put together. There are some of their trademark outlandish calls that Reno's finest respond to (the alligator bit is just an instant classic) but the plot reigns supreme throughout...for better or worse.

The benefit of having a full length movie is that you can call in some bigger named guest stars. Danny DeVito and particularly The Rock (pardon me, Dwayne Johnson) are funny as heck. When all is said and done though, what makes this movie is Reno's finest. The entire crew does one funny thing after another but it seems like Jones kind of got the shaft though. He's awesome in the show but his role in this movie is minimal. Dangle and Junior are the centerpieces in this film and it isn't a bad thing, they are the two best characters from the show (followed by Jones) and that flows into the movie seamlessly.

Basically your enjoyment of this movie will depend on what you went in expecting. Reno 911! Miami is entirely funny and I recommend it, but go in with no expectations and you'll definitely enjoy it more. Ironically, the bonus features (commentaries especially) almost shine brighter than the movie itself. They almost warrant the purchase alone.",1182816000,,1722,4.49520766773163

Instead of waiting around we chose to watch Reno 911: Miami.  Having never seen the television show before, it was fairly fresh for me.  I was delighted.  It was twisted and hilarious.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  That was then, this is now.  When the movie came out on DVD last Tueday, I remembered it with that hazy sense of nostalgia required when purchasing a new-release DVD for like $17. It has entertained me in the theater, gotta have it.  Well...it was much funnier the first time.  Perhaps the spontaneous gift of the gags had been lost.  Perhaps I just wasn't in the same frame opf mind.  Oh, it was funny in its vulgar, twisted hilarity, just not hystrical.  The socially-retarded rejects from the Reno Sheriffs Department head off to Miami to attend a Law Enforcement convention.  When they arrive they find that they can't get in because they aren't on the guest list.  Down-trodden and confused, they take to painting the town red.  The next day they arrive at the convention to discover that all of the law enforcement officers have ben quarantined inside the building due to some bio-terrorist plot.  Hence, the entire South Beach is unattended by law officers.  Reno Sheriffs Dept. to the rescue!  Duh!  The plot is as thin as a sheet of used Neutragena, and it should be.  The power lies in the pranks.  Overall, it just wasn't as hilarious as it was the first time around.  Also, what the f*ck is up with this slew of Not Rated DVD releases?  I watched the entire movie and I didn't notice anything different.  I'm sure the geeks did, but what, was there like 12 seconds of unreleased footage added to the movie.  Who knows? Still a funny flick, just not a new-release I would run out and buy at $17 (oops, I already did).  Wait till it's cheaper.

Yes, they should have been fired long ago from the Force, but in the end, the results are usually in their favor, by dumb luck only.  The premise of the movie is the Gang goes to Miami for a sherrif's convention, A bioterrorist attack on the hotel Quarenteens all the Miami Beach police and thousands of other officers, leaving the Reno Gang the only group outside the compound to patrol the the streets and beach in Miami Beach.  Yes, again the misfortune that they supposedly didn't get registered to the convention forced them to a ""different Lodging facility"", sparing them from the attack.

As hilarious as the show is, this one gave me a few chuckles but overall, the movie was below average.  We've seen it all before on the season episodes, and the screenplay was not interesting, and also a little confusing.  The few scenes that made me laugh kept me from ragging on this movie even more.

2823843,3,B000PISZ8Q,"I love Reno 911. It's an original, amazing show, and when you watch the season DVDs and listen to the ""in character"" commentary from the cast (which, more often than not, has nothing at all do do with what is going on during the episode), you know just how unique and funny this show is.

I wanted to like the movie. It moved V-E-R-Y slowly, and taking the cast out of their element (Reno) was a roll of the dice which gets points for risk-taking but loses points in the execution.

So my recommendation is that you set your expectations toward the ""LOW"" end of the scale and enjoy the high points the film DOES offer:

1). The whale (no spoilers here)

2). Jones expressing horror as he sees through the motel windows of his fellow sheriffs (once again, no spoilers)

3). The whole ""Colorado"" thing with Dangle (predictable yet satisfying closure on this riff, and it also adds an entirely new layer of characterization as we learn Dangle's true attitude toward his associates)

I've always thought that Cedric Yarborough's ""Jones"" was one of the strongest members of the cast, but he seems seriously under-utilized in this film. He's the CARPET guy, the undercover RASTA MAN...where's his big solo in this film? (Hint: He doesn't have one).

Finally, the ""Terry Moment"" at the end of the film (featuring Paul ""Pee Wee Herman"" Rubens) is a kiss-off, a disappointment, a stupid way to end the film. Rubens was transcendant as ""Rick from the Citizens Patrol"" in Season 4. Here, he's just a waste of space. The ""Terry"" character is a mix of the obvious and ambiguous, and the end of the film moves a few ""ambiguous"" details to the wrong side of the fence. Watch it and you'll see what I mean. The end of the movie seems like it was written in 5 minutes by writers who just wanted it to be over.

Caveat Emptor! I'd love to see Season 5 of Reno 911 but can easily do without another movie.",1182297600,7,1886,4.510263929618769
2823844,4,B000PISZ8Q,"If you are a fan of the Comedy Central show ""Reno 911"", then you will without a doubt enjoy this film excursion for exactly what it is: an hour and a half long episode with foul language, awkward and cringe-worthy situations, and lot's and lot's of nudity!

Essentially, it's best to think of the movie as a longer episode that is completely uncensored. Expecting anything more than that will only lead to disappointment. The set up for the main story-line appears thin and entirely unbelievable, but let's face it...this is comedy. It doesn't need to make that much sense in a true-to-life kind of way. It just has to entertain us and make us laugh -- and ""Reno 911: Miami"" manages to do that with ease.

Quick synopsis: Lt. Dangle and his fellow officers from the Reno police department are excited to learn that they have been invited to a special police convention held in Miami. The reason they were invited this year instead of being shunned as usual? Because everyone was invited this year. Nevertheless, the Reno police department arrive in Miami ready to prove their worth to their fellow commrads from across the nation. Unfortunately, their convention reservation didn't go through, and they were shunned once again. However, as luck would have it a mysterious toxin was introduced inside the convention, causing an immediate quarentine zone, locking all available police forces inside, with no one left to keep Miami safe. Unless the officers of Reno (the only officers not in the building during the biohazardous epidemic) can step up and patrol the streets of Miami, keeping crime at bay while at the same time trying to figure out a way to obtain an antidote to the dangerous toxin, then all is lost!

The thin plot-line allows for numerous comdic opportunites as the Reno police try to step up their game and maintain order within the crime-infested streets of Miami. Not many of their 911 calls have much to do with crime though. Among their ""emergencies"" the Reno police deal with a crocodile in a private swimming pool, a giant dead beached whale, a noise complaint at a famous rapper's mansion, and a complaint about 'obscene and lewd behavior' on the beach which brings two of our favorite officers face-to-face with a familiar perp who seemed to have made his way to Miami all the way from Reno! Also keep your eye out for Paul Rudd, who makes a cameo style appearance, and heads a drug-smuggling sub-plot!

Overall, you will laugh at this movie and it's ridiculousness. It's humor lies in it's ability to push the boundaries and walk that fine line between laugh-worthy comedy and cringe-worthy disgust. More than once you will find yourself going ""eeeewww"", and then shift around uncomfortably on your couch as you try to get the images out of your brain. But...that's to be expected from this ballsy and versital show. If you tell them ""do whatever you want, this is going to be completely uncensored and unrated"", then they are going to say ""alright, you're on!"".

Bottom line, it's not subtle comdey, but it's entertaining and enjoyable. If you don't like raunchy humor, then you might want to go ahead and skip this one. If you don't like nudity, skip it. If you don't like sexually uncomfortable situations, definitely skip it. This style of humor tends to be aimed more at college students than the masses of America, but even so, give it a try. You'll be laughing in no time.",1182038400,5,3406,4.785714285714286

8191828,5,B000PISZ8Q,"If you love LT Jim Dangle and the crew, you will enjoy this video. Lots of extras, extended cuts, and bonus segments of the team from Reno making fools of themselves. What's not to like about it?",1501977600,,195,4.297297297297297
8191829,3,B000PISZ8Q,"I ended up turning the movie off before it finished due to boredom.  I love the TV show and was hoping this would be on par with it.  I was disappointed completely.  Paul Rudd makes an appearance in it, so it seemed hopeful but even he couldn't save it.  If you can watch is for free and have absolutely nothing else to do with your time, take a look.  Otherwise find some other movie to spend your time with.",1501200000,,409,4.1265822784810124

8191832,4,B000PISZ8Q,"It's funny, but it's probably best if you're already a fan of Reno 911. It has some pretty funny jokes, though I did guess one of the major plot points.",1491609600,,152,4.1
