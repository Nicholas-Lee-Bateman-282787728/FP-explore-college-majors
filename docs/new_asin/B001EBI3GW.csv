3548691,5,B001EBI3GW,"Someone told about this lion called Christian that they had seen on TV.  Then I saw part of it on TV.  I almost got the DVD called a lion called Christian, but then I read the reviews.  They told me about this full version not the short version.  Have you ever seen a grown lion jump up and hug a person like a person does?  Even when it was sent back to the wild Christian still remembered those who came back to visit him a year or more later, with the same hug.  You have to see it to believe it.",1344816000,,499,3.891089108910891
3548692,5,B001EBI3GW,"This DVD presents a wonderful, and thorough, history of the Lion called Christian, supported by the Born Free Foundation, and given an intoduction by a representative thereof.  The original tapes of the Born Free Foundation have been remastered and attractively presented, and, as with the presentation ""Christian the Lion Who Thought He was People"", the film has the merry song of 'Christian the Lion' rolling through it.  This is a warm film of life, hope, nature and it's animals, disappointment, success and tragedy, but ultimate truimph.  Highly recommended.",1338336000,10,563,5.375
3548693,5,B001EBI3GW,"Read the book on Christian the Lion before viewing this video.  The video was awesome to watch.  Being animal lovers, we found this whole story absolutely remarkable. Christian's memory was greater than mine is! :) Christian's story is touching, and he was such a fun, loving and majestic animal. This is one video that will be watched over and over and over again.  Highly recommend it along with the book on Christian!",1314403200,14,420,4.805555555555555
3548694,5,B001EBI3GW,The first time I saw a video clip of Christian the Lion I said I have to have this!!!  I have looked for a very long time for a complete video of the story that was affordable.  I finally found it here at Amazon.  I received my product in a timely manner.  The video is new and was wrapped in plastic.  I have not watched it yet but it is exactly what I have been looking for.  I am very pleased with my purchase.,1284336000,8,413,3.857142857142857
3548695,5,B001EBI3GW,"""Christian the Lion at World's End"" is an awesome documentary video.  The relationship between the humans and lions in this film is unbelievable. I had no idea that lions are so capable of loving and interacting with people with such gentleness and playful enthusiasm.  This Love and regard for their human family extended after the necessary introduction into the wild and tears will fall when reconnection occurs.

I watched this with my husband, son and his girlfriend.  The friendship between ""Boy"" and ""Christian"" moved all of us, as did the paternal care they both gave to the young cubs featured.  A classic, historical journey full of Love, Tragedy and Relationships that are beyond belief.  A Must-See.  (By the way, my son and his girlfriend were so impressed by the film, that they asked to borrow it to show their friends)

3548696,5,B001EBI3GW,"This is the story I was looking for!  The story of Christian from the beginning, including the clip we've all seen on You Tube.  I loved this movie!  Sat down and watched it as soon as it arrived.  Shows all the problems and joys involved in re-introducing Christian to the wild, including the emotions of John and Ace during the process.  There is also plenty of information from and about George Adamson and his work.  Some very sad moments mixed in with the joy.  What a fabulous film; I loved it and you will tool",1251331200,26,517,4.378947368421053
3548697,4,B001EBI3GW,I was captivated by the clip on YouTube of Christian the Lion.  I was excited to get this full version of the documentary.  I'm a long time fan of George & Joy Adamson and enjoyed seeing this documentary film I had not seen before.  This will be of great interest to other fans of George's life's work or those who just love lions and Africa.,1240876800,22,342,4.230769230769231
3548698,5,B001EBI3GW,"Absolutely amazing DVD about a true love story between a lion and his caretakers.  It was the best story I have ever seen about the love between man and animal.  It was so incredible how much love this lion had for both his caretakers and vice versa.  I will never forget his four leg jump off the ground onto each man--his way of hugging them.  And, to have a wonderful end to the story when so many don't go well.  Hats off to Anthony and  John for a loving tribute to a charismatic, loveable lion. I wish I knew him. You must be so proud and so happy for the love and care you were able to give to Christian while making sure he had the right life to the end of his days.  In return he gave you back more love than you ever imagined.!! Truly amazing story!!",1440201600,,760,4.060402684563758

3548713,5,B001EBI3GW,"This movie is wonderful.  The lions are not ""actors"" portraying the lives of other lions.  They are the actual characters in action.  Christian is amazingly beautiful.  The viewer gets to watch him grow from just a few months old to being a two-year-old adult in his prime.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.",1387238400,,299,4.784313725490196

3548716,5,B001EBI3GW,"This is a lion that otherwise would have eaten them raw for dinner, and here he is lunging at them with affection and hugs.  A good movie, but i would tell adults to watch it before presenting it to smaller children because they would not understand the brutality of nature depicted or the sadness of loosing one's friend even if it is a lion.  Otherwise, pop the popcorn and get ready for an unbelievable ride.  I would also recommend ""Elsa:Born Free"" to anyone who hasn't seen it.",1376524800,,482,4.517241379310345
3548717,5,B001EBI3GW,"Christian was a beautiful creature.  It is quite remarkable how this story has resurfaced after 40 years.  And still touching hearts of millions around the world.  The story of Christian, George and Tony is so uplifting.  A beautiful story and lets face it today, there are not that many good news items happening.  Would recomment this to anyone who needs a feel good story.",1373846400,,375,4.796875

The British Lion that Born free, top lion specialist in the world worked with this lion to teach him how to live as a wild lion.
