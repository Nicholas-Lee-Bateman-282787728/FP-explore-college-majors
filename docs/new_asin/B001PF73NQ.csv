8333207,3,B001PF73NQ,I am not sure what the previous reviewer was upset about. This video is not meant to be a big professional production. Just a simple video showing things to do in Cozumel if you are diving. I found this to be entertaining. I also want to point out I don't know who these divers are but don't do what they do. They dive in situations where more equipment and training should be used and they do not use proper techniques. Other then that if you are a junkie for blowing bubbles and are stuck on shore it is worth your 30 min.,1381536000,,524,4.147058823529412
8333208,1,B001PF73NQ,"This documentary is nothing but a collection of homemade videos without commentary, explanation or narrative.  It is uninspiring and uninspired.  I definitely do not recommend that anybody interested in caves, diving or Yucatan purchase this DVD.",1378425600,2,246,5.805555555555555
8333209,5,B001PF73NQ,This was very interesting to see just what is below the surface of the ocean and didn't know of all the caves that have been found and explored recently.,1371686400,,153,4.310344827586207
