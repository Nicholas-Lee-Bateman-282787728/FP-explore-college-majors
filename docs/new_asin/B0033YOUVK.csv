8480540,5,B0033YOUVK,One of the very moving experiences of people on a sacred journey who had strong or little ties to the holocaust and shared deep and moving experiences which united them.,1498348800,,169,4.666666666666667
8480541,5,B0033YOUVK,"This is a startlingly moving film about a group of people attending a few days retreat at the concentration camps in Auschwitz where mostly Jews were killed by Hitler and his killing machine (i.e. people who were willing to do Hitler's bidding). Some of those attending are adult children of Holocaust survivors while others are adult children of the Nazi's.  They tell the stories of their parents and how it has affected their own lives.  We, as viewers become witnesse also to this brutal time in human history.  The film is a testament to present day healing and forgiveness.  A film of intense beauty and sadness.",1461110400,2,618,4.80188679245283
