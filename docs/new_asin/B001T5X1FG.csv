3788129,5,B001T5X1FG,I ordered South Beach Yoga a few weeks ago and I'm so happy I did!  It is a perfect blend of restorative and gentle yoga flow.  Jess is an awesome instructor and the visuals are just so relaxing.  I practice with this DVD every other day (I trade off with Teddi Bryant's Prenatal Yoga which is awesome!!!)...I don't get bored with this yoga DVD at all.  I look forward to it each and every time.  My confidence in a successful labor and delivery is building with each session.  I just can't say enough!  Thank you so much for a wonderful yoga DVD.,1246406400,2,547,4.303921568627451
3788130,4,B001T5X1FG,"I bought this DVD for my wife who is looking to stay fit during her
pregnancy. She wants to help reduce her risk of having a c-section. She has
been doing the DVD work out several times a week for the last 2 months. We
both love the new found energy she has. DVD also gives some labor room
techniques for the mom and partner. We'll see how they come in handy...",1242259200,3,361,4.027777777777778
3788131,5,B001T5X1FG,"I just got the DVD on Sunday and love it!  It is not your average yoga DVD for sure.

There is so much more to it than just a yoga workout.  It will help you center, be still, and bring your baby to your awareness, as well as give you a great yoga workout.

Can't wait for the Post Natal DVD!",1236729600,,292,3.737704918032787
3788132,5,B001T5X1FG,"I have done the video every day since I got it.  I love it!  It helps me sleep at night...not to mention saves me money on prenatal yoga classes.  It is classy, hip, modern, visually stunning and a fantastic workout.  There is something for all trimesters of pregnancy and all yoga skill levels. I plan on buying copies for friends and family that are pregnant.",1235865600,2,361,4.507692307692308
3788133,5,B001T5X1FG,"As a yoga enthusiast, I was looking for a prenatal program that was challenging, but was also tailored to meet the specific needs of my new body and baby. I am so happy to have this DVD as part of my regular prenatal exercise routine. I am also privileged to have taken Jess's classes in person and I love how convenient it is to have her warmth and knowledge on hand for my home practice. There are all kinds of fun features, including breathing and delivery techniques. I highly recommend this for any mom-to-be.",1235001600,3,514,4.4787234042553195
3788134,5,B001T5X1FG,I highly recommend South Beach Prenatal Yoga. The program is good for those who practice yoga regularly or those who are new to it. It also provides modifications for each trimester and special sections with helpful tips on labor and delivery.,1234656000,2,243,4.951219512195122
8340643,5,B001T5X1FG,"I am so happy I bought this DVD - I have been using it from the first few weeks of my pregnancy and it is still useful at 35 weeks - I love it so much. The techniques are very helpful to cope with the pains and aches all over the body. I would advise you to get it and use it as much as possible during your pregnancy - you will connect with your body and baby at a very special level.
Thank you...",1384214400,,398,3.6941176470588237
8340644,5,B001T5X1FG,I used this through my whole pregnancy and after. Great hip openers! You'll feel so much better after. Dpon't waste your money on other DVDs I tried them all. The relaxing music is nice too. I practice before bed and I am relaxed ready for sleep.,1363651200,,246,4.369565217391305
8340645,1,B001T5X1FG,"I didn't feel safe at all with some of these exercises. I was in shape and practiced yoga before I got pregnant but just didn't feel like some of the positions were safe for my baby.  I used it only once.  I chose not to practice yoga while pregnant because I don't think it's safe, I don't care what the 'experts' say.  Oh and by the way, I had the easiet labor and delivery without any of this!",1341878400,,396,4.051282051282051
8340646,3,B001T5X1FG,"I bought this DVD during my first trimester thinking it would be a great way to exercise before baby. As a very active and athletic person, I found the DVD a little boring and slow going - especially the last segments where poses are held for 3 or 4 minutes at a time. Perhaps I am not ""pregnant enough"" to appreciate the stretches, but I definitely didn't feel the benefit of a work out.",1338768000,,388,4.256756756756757
8340647,5,B001T5X1FG,"A friend of mine told me about this video. I am so glad I listen and bought it. It made exercising during my pregnancy a joy.
This is also a perfect gift for any pregnant friend. We all tend to by baby stuff while pregnant. Why not do something for the baby instead. If you are relax, the baby is too.
Love it ! Love it !",1326844800,,321,3.8059701492537314
8340648,5,B001T5X1FG,"This such a well made video. It helped me so much during my pregnancy. It was hard for me to exercise and this help me stay in shape while relaxing. I have never been a yoga fan before, now I am hooked.  the great thing is that you can also use it after.
Really super satisfied.",1326844800,,278,3.9642857142857144
8340649,5,B001T5X1FG,"This DVD is fantastic.  I have been doing it for about 2.5 months.  I'm currently 38 weeks and still enjoying it thoroughly.  It's a great compliment to a more intense workout to keep toned.  The focus and hip opening exercises are fantastic and as a professional dancer, they have kept me limber and ready to let that baby out in a relaxed environment.

While it will not be enough to keep you in shape, it is great to prepare you mentally for labour and to relax all those muscles completely. The tone of the DVD is perfect.  My only complaint is that she does not reverse what leg she is doing, so if you want to follow along with her visually you have to do the opposite to what she is saying.  This is a very well-informed yoga practitioner, who actually knows what alterations need to be made for each trimester.

I only wish I had it earlier and that she had a post natal DVD!",1310601600,,883,4.27710843373494
8340650,5,B001T5X1FG,I tried this video at the positive recommendations of other reviews and was very satisfied. It has relieved my lower back pain from both lifting up my toddler all the time as well as the added weight of the pregnancy. It helps me sleep more fitfully too. I'm sure I'll be using this video even after pregnancy.,1285891200,,310,4.456140350877193
8340651,5,B001T5X1FG,"I bought South Beach Prenatal Yoga after my doctor recommended yoga was was a great way to stay in shape during my pregnancy. I had some experience with yoga but heard that it was important to find a yoga instructor or DVD that incorporated modified poses for pregnancy. The instructor modifies the positions for each trimester, which is helpful being that my body is changing so much. It's an awesome workout and I feel great!",1268611200,,427,4.706666666666667
8340652,5,B001T5X1FG,"I spent a lot of time researching prenatal yoga videos before getting pregnant.  This gives a good workout, relaxing, great stretching and it has lots of extra info.  I am very happy with this dvd I LOVE it.",1257292800,2,207,4.421052631578948
