186780,4,1566331803,"""Hoover Dam, the Making of a Monument,"" is more than just the story of how the Hoover Dam was built.  It's the story of people who fought for the dam and fought against it.  This fine documentary puts the struggle  to build this dam in its proper context:  in the midst of the Great  Depression when men were begging for work and in the American Southwest  where farms were thirsting for water.  In just one hour, this film  chronicles the struggle to gain approval for the dam, and then the search  to find someone who could build the something most engineers said was  impossible, and finally the actual construction.  The film also tells the  story of the average workers who flocked to the desert looking for work,  regardless of how dangerous it was.  The documentary's validity benefits  from interviews with many former dam workers and residents of the local  workers' village.  These interviews, along with extensive period footage  and still photos, paint a vivid picture of ordinary men and women who  created something marvelous and fantastic in the midst of one of America's  greatest domestic crises.  This film will help you appreciate Hoover Dam a  little bit more the next time you see it, and will remind you that great  works don't just occur by themselves.  They happen because people, from the  highest levels of power to those digging the tunnels, make them happen.",956534400,21,1386,4.82051282051282
186781,5,1566331803,"""Rescue at Sea"" is more than a documentary of a long-forgotten collision between two ships; it is the story of a turning point in world communications.  In 1909, two ships collided off of the Nantucket coast.  The passengers and crews of both ships, over 1,500 people, would have died  if not for the presence of a wireless telegraph on board one of the ships,  the ""Republic,"" and for the courage and determination of the  wireless operator.
Considered a luxury and a toy up to that point, the  wireless was only on board the ship so rich passengers could talk to  friends and receive stock quotes.  With the wireless' use in saving so many  lives, people were quick to recognize its value as an essential safety  measure.  The wireless telegraph also changed the way people viewed sea  travel.  No longer were ships isolated islands all to themselves when they  left harbor.  The world had shrunk a little bit due to the lifeline the  wireless provided.
""Rescue at Sea"" is a dramatic story and none  of that drama is lost in this one-hour documentary.  Producer Ben Loeterman  puts this story in context with its times by detailing the necessary risks  people took when travelling by sea.  Loeterman uses excellent photographs  and archival documentation to bring this rescue back into focus.  The  diaries of passengers and contemporary newspaper accounts add to the  realism.  Although celebrated in 1909, nobody today remembers wireless  operator Jack Binns, who fought to get to the wireless room when his ship  collided and stayed there until help arrived.  This film gives Binns the  credit he still richly deserves.  The film also points out how with the  advent of the wireless we started to regard communciations and  transportation as two separate things.  This event marked a watershed in  the history of communications, and this film documents it with all of the  drama it had over 90 years ago.",956361600,4,1909,4.8930817610062896
186782,5,1566331803,"Originally aired as an installment of the highly acclaimed PBS series ""The American Experience"", this is the story of the murder that scandalized New York society at the turn of the century.
The documentary  tells the story of the beautiful Evelyn Nesbit, famous stage actress and  ""Gibson Girl"", and her role in the murder of New York's leading  architect, Stanford White.
First White's lover, the social climbing  Nesbit eventually married the eccentric heir to a railroad fortune, Harry  K. Thaw. Thaw was obsessed by White, hated him, and hated the fact that his  wife had one been White's lover. Nesbit played off Thaw's jealousy until it  led to murder.
The documentary is wonderful, and shows the feeding frenzy  of the turn-of-the-century press, on which CNN has nothing.",949881600,11,779,5.078740157480315
7796715,3,1566331803,"If you watch Kinsey, you will say, Thank goodness we don't live in the sexually repressive past!  This documentary will make you say the same thing.  It shows pioneering feminists such as Margaret Sanger.  I think folk may want to see this documentary alongside ones about Susan B. Anthony.  This is really good Womens Studies 101.
The work does deal with race, but I did feel that it had a mostly white focus.  Have you ever seen the School House Rock episode on womens suffrage?  It shows no women of color in it.  Here they interview Professor Dorothy Roberts, whose book Killing the Black [Female] Body is really an amazing legal text.  However, the work said when the pill couldn't be tested in Massachusetts, the makers first tried it in Puerto Rico.  The problem is that the work says nothing about the history of forced sterilization on that island.  Rosie Perez brings it up in her documentary about Puerto Ricans.  I found it highly problematic that this matter never comes up.
I sometimes strongly believe the cliche, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  On the one hand, women embraced the pill.  However, when some women complained about side effects, pill makers and male doctors didn't want to hear it.
This work may feel dated to some.  It says nothing about Viagra and how the blue pill has changed life for American men.  There is a documentary out there made by a Brown University alumna that asks if we will ever have a pink pill.  Students who want to write a then-and-now paper could compare these two documentaries.",1419465600,,1555,4.682656826568266

7796718,5,1566331803,"The PBS series American Experience has always had the power to transport its viewers to times past, but never so much as in the 1995 (Season 8) ""Murder of the Century"", the story of the murder of Stanford White in New York in 1906.

This phenomenal documentary captures the paths and patterns of sex, money and media in early 20th century New York. It is a story also of architecture and criminal justice in the Gilded Age, in which 1 percent of the population controlled 90 percent of the nation's wealth; a tale whose relevance and distinction to our own times pours down upon us like a steady rainfall.

The  young and lovely Evelyn Nesbitt rises from poverty in Pittsburgh to become a model and showgirl at the center of social life in New York, where she meets and falls in love with the city's most prominent architect, Stanford White. But a jealous love triangle develops when a very wealthy manufacturing heir, Harry Thaw, competes for Evelyn's attentions.

The astonishing yet understated narration, written by Carl Charlson and spoken by David Ogden Stiers, is among American Experience's very best voiceovers. Stiers nails it in his usual laid back style, but with an intoxicating dose of capriciousness that elevates itself to a tongue-in-cheek satire of the period's social mores.

What a wonderful illustration of the use of Aftereffects (or Oxberry camera) and editing to tell a story, tracking on old photographs in pantograph style. The interviews are also superb, featuring author Brendan Gill, David Lowe, and Suzannah Lessard (a great granddaughter of White's).

Don't miss this one. It is upon documentaries like this that American Experience's sterling reputation rests. This needs to be released on DVD and Blu-ray. A rare find if you can get hold of it.",1339200000,4,1777,4.966329966329966

7796721,5,1566331803,"I have the video from ""The American Experience"" series and have shown it in my high school history class several times, much to the delight of my students, since many of them can readily identify with the young Evelyn Nesbit.  Strangely enough, they seem to show much sympathy for Stanford White rather than for Harry Thaw and their feelings about the case are underscored when, at the end of the documentary, we are informed that on her deathbed Evelyn declared that Stanford White was the only man she had ever loved, understandable since, despite the age difference between the two, he showed her the love which she had lacked in her childhood as well in her subsequent marriage to Thaw, who readily abused her.  A sordid but very human tale from a fascinating time period in our history.",1074556800,12,791,4.72463768115942

7796723,5,1566331803,"Today I would not be surprised if most people knew about the murder of Stanford White by Harry K. Thaw from the book/movie/musical ""Ragtime.""  But the murder of the prominent turn-of-the-century architect who gave his name to that college in San Francisco by the husband of showgirl Evelyn Nesbit was considered to be the Murder of the Century (even though it was 1906 and there were 94 more years to go).  Thaw was the heir to a Pittsburgh railroad fortune, and when White became enamored with his wife the love triangle turned ugly.  Thaw was acquitted by reason of insanity and divorced Evelyn, who went on to be a sensation in vaudeville as ""The Girl on the Swing,"" a reference to the sex games she claimed to have played with White.  This sensational murder story had money, power, class, love, rage, lust and revenge.  Even though the O.J. Simpson trial had race instead of class, it really did not have as much going for it as did Thaw's trial, escept, of course, for live coverage on cable TV.  Thaw's trial was merely reported ""to the ends of the civilized globe.""  Apparently, things did not change all that much during the 20th century when it comes to sensational trials.  David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice to narrate this fascinating documentary from the PBS series ""The American Experience.""  Final note: Supposedly Lucy Maud Montgomery based her description of Anne Shirley in ""Anne of Green Gables"" on a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit.",1009065600,11,1455,4.788
7796724,5,1566331803,"The American Experience series is one of the stellar viewing experiences on television. When they focus on the Presidents, the show assumes even more gravity. These two volumes focus on Theodore Roosevelt and FDR, two of the greatest Presidents of the 20th century. The T.R. documentary is particularly strong in his younger years and the photography is gorgeous, especially around Sagamore Hill, his Long Island home. David McCullough's narration is, as always, masterful.
The FDR segment is oustanding. They open with the radio flash of Roosevelt's death and for those of us who were not yet born, it's as if we are magically transported back to April 12, 1945. Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin is a joy throughout, as she weaves her commentary and perspective into the fabric of the narration. For all of us who revere Franklin Roosevelt, this is the quintessential documentary on his life and times. The music is buoyant, poignant and memorable - it mirrors Franklin Roosevelt in every way. The two best American Experience Presidential profiles are undoubtedly this one on FDR and their 1990 look at LBJ, also available on Amazon.",976406400,5,1133,5.096774193548387
