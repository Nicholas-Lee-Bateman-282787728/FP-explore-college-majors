8124495,5,B000FL6XE6,"Using a staccato type style of still photos, akin to Chris Marker's La Jetee, to help finish Andrzej Munk's Passenger film, since the Polish director was killed in a car crash before completion of this remarkable story. A young jewish woman inmate is incarcerated at the Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp and by fate is hand picked by her Nazi supervisor out of 1,000 to be her personal clerk in the management and inventory of the horde of personal belongings amassing daily. This is not a story of women recognizing the ally they have in each other, but more a challenege of upwomanship in the taking down of each other regardless of good intentions. Years later upon her return from years vacationing abroad, whisking home a new husband, our former Nazi protaganist is confronted by the arrival of her former Jewish immate at the first port of call close to home which in this case is England. If glances could kill, the look they give each other upon recognition is cold as ice and hot as fire. To make matters worse, the Jewish enjenue's future husband was also at the same prison camp. His fate is left untold.

This is where their new found freedoms meet reality and we foresee a lifetime of agony for one, possibly both. The film is cut short in homage and repsect to Munk as a major auteur of Polish cinema so as not to misinterpret his original vision. This film nestles comfortably between the recent revival of A Film Unfinished about the Warsaw ghetto in May of 1942 just months before the major deportations of 250,000 Jews to their murder at the hands of the Nazi SS and Alain Resnai's 1955 film Night and Fog, the 31 minute stalwart statement of the wrath the concentration camps welded on 7 million lives by the Germans during WW II as an enduring lesson in life and reasons to never war against each other again. The pot is sweetened with the additional documentary on the life of Andrzej Munk by his assistant director - Andrzej Brzozowski made in 2000 with extensive interviews from Roman Polanski and Andrzej Wadja whom both worked with Munk as peers while he established his enduring mark on Polish cinema. A tremendous package on the lives of a nation in the worst of times and a look back 60 years later on those whom help frame and document the otrocities unknown unless made public to the world via a visual media. This is a powerful and strong package and comes highly recommended for anyone alive to know the history so it does not ever repeat itself. A big hand to Second Run DVD for their exemplary efforts and results.",1331769600,8,2549,4.602197802197802
