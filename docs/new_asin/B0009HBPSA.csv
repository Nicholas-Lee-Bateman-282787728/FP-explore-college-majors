8061037,3,B0009HBPSA,"In 1914, L. Frank Baum, author of 15 ""Wizard of Oz"" books, started his own film company. Baum scripted and oversaw production on all the Oz movies. Life-size puppets were used for some characters, while actors often portrayed various roles from film to film. The first three titles in this set are of particular interest, for these are how the author himself wanted his classic children's books to appear on theater screens. They are certainly a LOT different than the 1939 MGM movie and yet, still seem familiar.

SYNOPSES:

""The Magic Cloak of Oz"" - Woven by fairies, the magic cloak will grant a single wish to the unhappiest child in Oz. Violet MacMillan portrays King Timothy-- later she would be Dorothy.

""His Majesty, The Scarecrow of Oz"" - Princess Gloria is the hypotenuse of a love triangle. She's in love with a gardener's son, while evil King Crewl has his sights set on her.

""The Patchwork Girl of Oz"" - The first-ever Oz movie. The patchwork girl, created out of rags, is the perfect servant until she develops a free will. Future 'Our Gang' dirctor Hal Roach appears as the Cowardly Lion.

""The Wizard of Oz"" - After his father's death, L. Frank Baum Jr. tried reviving the series. This second cinematic telling of the original Oz story had Oliver Hardy in the cast and featured a lot of slapstick comedy. The original 1910 movie was based more on the stage musical than the book.

8061038,3,B0009HBPSA,"I got this DVD because it was the only way I could get ""the Patchwork Girl of Oz"", even though that would mean me watching the other films (""His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz"", ""the Magic Cloak"" and Larry Semon's faithless Chadwick ""the Wizard of Oz"") having them already of previous DVDs, of course I didn't actually have to watch them all over again.  I only watched ""Patchwork Girl"" and the 'Magic Cloak' Main Menu for the first time here.  I will review the actual films later.

This DVD, the packaging and the Disks, is different to possibly all other DVDs:  When you open the case, there is a *stupid* black slot in the middle which holds the DVDs on both sides - which is very difficlut to put back into place and is unnecessary and there are two Disks, each with 1 Film on either side.

I already have ""His Majesty, the Scarecrow"" and ""the Wizard"" both on their individual DVDs and the MGM 3-Disk with ""Magic Cloak (NOT Oz)"" (both of which are improved on that edition) and here on this ""World"" DVD, are exactly the same, without any change whatsoever.  'Patchwork Girl' is the better film of all 4, because it is based on and doesn't stray too far from its actual book, as well as including the ONLY appearance of OZMA in her THRONE ROOM (I don't count her head appearnce in the openings).  'Scarecrow' is a combination of 'Wonderful Wizard', 'Marvelous Land' and 'Road' etc. before its own book the following year, 'Magic Cloak' DOES NOT have ""of Oz"" in the title and has some of the film focus on Fluff and Bud's Mule in his own animal adventure resulting in a hurried resolution to the actual story.  ""Wizard"", as everybody knows, is a waste using Larry Semon's slapstick comedy that corrupts the original story, written by the actor and author's son!  The 3 main films all have a slow 'departure-from-book' sequence and a useless new character called the Zoop.

I hate it when any DVD with Silent Oz Films uses colour footage for the cover when usually they don't actually appear in the film ESPECIALLY when they show a Rainbow & Yellow Brick Road and make the guidelines/synopsis sound similar to MGM.",1166313600,4,2114,4.568783068783069
8061039,1,B0009HBPSA,I bought this dvd for my daughter who adores The Wizard Of Oz. I didn't know it's a silent film. Definetely uninteresting for kids.,1141344000,,131,4.5
