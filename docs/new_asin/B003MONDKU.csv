8400422,1,B003MONDKU,This package was open and appears to be used.  I am disappointed.,1481587200,,65,4.416666666666667
8400423,5,B003MONDKU,I felt like this was a great place to start. Larry Payne's voice is very calm and relaxing and he explains each step. Very happy with this dvd!,1470009600,,143,4.142857142857143
8400424,2,B003MONDKU,"was advertised as an easy Yoga for Prime, or mature people  .Maybe Ok for people that have done yoga for years, but not beginners, or mature folk.",1439942400,,146,4.407407407407407
8400425,4,B003MONDKU,"This is a great yoga workout for days when one feels a tiny bit under the weather, & also excellent for newbies. The setting is a near-ancient grove of trees, with model in aqua. She shows up nicely in a well-lit space in partial shade of the grove of trees. The narrative and music are soothing and done in nice balance. Because of gentle repetition of poses, I felt at ease modifying how long I held a position. The M.D. who narratives will coach you to breathe throughout...in a way, I haven't seen on other DVDs. No wonder its an immune boost. A good addition to a well-rounded yoga DVD collection.",1408233600,5,602,4.4324324324324325
8400426,5,B003MONDKU,This yoga CD is helpful to relax and get in shape.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a yoga tape.,1396483200,2,114,3.75
8400427,1,B003MONDKU,"First of all, the DVD worked in my lap top but not in my DVD player...said ""no disk"".  The Level One Immune Booster and general conditioning video was not a gentle beginners introduction to Yoga and if I had known they made claims for healing or preventing common respiratory ailments such as allergies and chronic colds I would not have purchased this item.",1391644800,3,358,4.682539682539683
8400428,5,B003MONDKU,"I've taken a lot of yoga classes over the years and bought a lot of yoga DVD's along the way too. Larry Payne's Prime of Life Yoga Series is THE best I've ever tried.

 I use the Immune Booster Level One on an almost daily basis and love it. After a long break from practising yoga, this was a wonderful way to ease back into my practise. After only a few weeks, I have regained the ""ground"" I lost and have started to progress again too.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
