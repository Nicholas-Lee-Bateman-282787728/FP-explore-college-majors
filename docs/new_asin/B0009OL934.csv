2307067,4,B0009OL934,It is a joy to take trip down memory lane and see how we kind of were as kids. All I can say is that it does not turn out how u think it will. Especially looking back 22 years later.,1357344000,,182,3.4634146341463414
2307068,5,B0009OL934,This DVD was finally relesed in Australia over a week ago. Season 3 was a great season. Wheels parents die in a car crash in the first two episodes. After they forbid him to hang out with Joey Jeremiah his best friend. Throughout season 3 Wheels struggles to accept his parents deaths which is understandle no one could blame Wheels for the way he feels. All though how he acted out in Degrassi High was unacceptable. Spike had her baby over the summer a beautiful baby girl named Emma who you can see know in Degrassi Next Generation going to Degrassi herself. Joey remains very committed to the Zit Remedy. His blossoming romance with Caitlin is one of the the highlights of season 3.  Melanie's and Kathleens friendship starts to go under strain when Kathleen becomes vice president and when Kathleen gets anorexia. They become friends again at the end of the season when Allison tries to attract Snake away from Melanie. Melanie also steals $20 from her mum to go on a date with Snake. Shane takes acid at a concert. The twins switch places when Cluch asks Heather out who Erika likes. Lucy acts grown up this season. First she has Paul as a boyfriend then Clutch. Arthurs and Yick's friendship is also under strain when Arthurs mum wins the lottery. Simon and Alexa break up early in the season but then get back together. Michelle and BLT start going out desprite her parents disappoval because BLT is black. Snake finds out his brother Glen is gay. In Australia we have a different cover Joey and Caitlin are on the front. Also we had two discs instead of 3. And no special features. But this DVD is great anyway.,1130630400,,1620,4.56701030927835
2307069,5,B0009OL934,"The first season of ""Degrassi Junior High"" often came very close to feeling like public access, with a miniscule (at best) budget and often very wooden/weird acting. A true guilty pleasure. From a technical standpoint, Season Two was a big improvement. New topics tackled included depression, divorce/remarriage, and sex. The teen actors clearly developed their talents and come off more believable as they did in Season 1. The camerawork and direction also improved.

Season Three is something of an anomaly.  With two seasons under their belt, you would've thought the people behind the scenes (directors, writers, editors, etc.) would have improved by Season Three -- yet be on the lookout for some major editing gaffes, continuity errors, and just plain weirdness (the huge sweat stains on the math teacher's shirt in a few episodes come to mind...the directors must've come to their senses when they put him in blazers in later episodes).

Yet, there are many powerful moments in Season Three.  Wheels' losing his parents in a drunk driving accident and the aftermath of the event are well done.  An episode about eating disorders is also good.  The acting from the young cast also is an improvement over seasons 1 & 2.  Pat M. as Joey Jeremiah is especially good.  The DVD set comes with teaching supplements that would be helpful for any jr.high/hs teachers that are thinking of showing episodes in class. There's also a short ""behind the scenes"" special which is interesting.

Like the first two season collections, you can't go wrong with this DVD. You'll appreciate its honest portrayal of 12-15 year olds, but find much to laugh at in terms of the production values and overall 80s nostalgia. A+.",1128988800,,1707,5.003533568904594
2307070,5,B0009OL934,"I discovered Degrassi in the dark years when my parents canceled cable and I was relegated to public television in the afternoons.  What I've rediscovered is that when you watch one episode, you can't stop...you have to keep going through 4 or 5.  This season was excellent, though Stephanie Kaye is sorely missed.

The old school Degrassi far exceeds the ""next generation"" for one simple reason: it's painfully honest.  You look at them and remember when you had an outfit that bad, or braces that shiny, or a crush on a guy who actually wore tight jeans...  The Next Generation is too slick and too good looking - part of the allure of the old Degrassi is that it shows that adolescence is brutal and awkward, but it does get better.

Some behind the scenes features and interviews would be awesome - it'd be interesting to see what the old bunch is up to now and what they think of the show.",1126483200,12,894,4.487654320987654
2307071,5,B0009OL934,"During its third season, you can see Degrassi slightly alter its format a bit to fit in with the significant changes to the characters through puberty. There's more focus on the relationships, with romance brewing between Caitlin and Joey, and episodes about interracial dating, dating a senior, and the tension between teen parents. Stephanie is gone, Spike's given birth, Kathleen is still a prude, and there's the addition of the funniest character I've forgotten about over the years; Arnold's cousin. The most significant story arc in this season concerns the death of Wheel's parents, which was inspired by the death of the actor's real life father, and it's dealt with a much more grittier tone than the previous seasons. (Compare it to the bout of depression Stephanie suffered in season two.) I reckon the performance is still as powerful as anything you'd see today. This set has a great behind-the-scenes feature that really highlights the impact of the show and will really open your eyes about how convincing the realism was seen during its day.  All in all, a great season and a nice lead in to what will be the much darker and serious, Degrassi High series. I can't wait!",1126224000,3,1186,4.900497512437811
2307072,5,B0009OL934,I will buy this DVD like every other Degrassi release because I like crap. This show has a sinister attraction that snared me as a youth...and never let go. I wish the Canadians would stop making these teenage soap operas so I wouldn't feel like such an idiot watching them.,1124582400,9,274,4.5
2307073,5,B0009OL934,Love this show. Its a classic,1445644800,,29,4.0
2307074,5,B0009OL934,"Once again the series does not disappoint. The stories are well written and cover a range of topics that so many people can relate to during our teenage years. Dealing with things like teen pregnancy, losing one's parents, eating disorders, peer pressure, drugs, and finding out that a loved one is gay can be difficult for anyone to handle yet they're common issues that young people deal with daily. The series makes it easy to relate to the characters and understand many of the challenges they go through. Aside from the deeper issues, there are so many lighter topics that are covered which I find myself thinking ""I remember thinking that"" or ""I used to feel that way, too"". From serious to light hearted, Degrassi Junior High has got it all.",1443916800,,748,4.717557251908397
2307075,5,B0009OL934,"This series is wholesome and deals with real issues kids have. I still enjoy watching these, even after 25 years. Highly recommend.",1439769600,,131,5.0
2307076,5,B0009OL934,"Degrassi Junior High is a Canadian TV production that garnered critical acclaim due to its unflinching treatment of serious issues experienced by adolescents. The series ran for three season and then spun-off into Degrassi High which ran for 2 seasons. It is recommended that the show be watched in order since most of the actors portray the same character roles and it shows how these characters mature and evolve as time progresses.

In Season 3, Wheels experiences a great tragedy when his parents are killed in an accident involving a drunk driver. Wheels then finds himself living with his grandparents who are both aging and life becomes very challenging. This season also deals with teenage drinking and how this impacts not only the teen concerned but those around him. Melanie discovers that Kathleen, the high achieving student with an alcoholic mom, has an eating disorder. The consequences of divorce are also explored when Arthur copes with his divorced dad dating again.

Prejudice and racism is also explored in this season when Melanie is invited to the graduation dance by BLT, who is black. When Melanies parents discover BLT is Black, they refuse to let her go out with him, citing that she is too young to date. Melanie must then decide whether she should let things be or act according to her convictions.

In between the serious episodes, there are some light moments such as teenage crushes, pranks, etc. This show is so well put-together and I particularly love that it doesnt flinch from tackling hard subjects. Even though the issues are difficult and sensitive ones, they are handled with finesse which makes this show a great family show for teens and parents to watch and discuss.",1439164800,,1709,4.947735191637631

2307085,5,B0009OL934,great memories. A bit cheesy in the music and acting but it's 1980's situations and dilemmas at its best. Kind of cutting edge issues for a Public Tv show in Canada. Worth a look.,1417737600,,179,4.294117647058823
2307086,5,B0009OL934,If youve ever seen the newer  degrassi you know that it deals with topics most shows are afraid to and degrassi junior high does the same..great acting..and great storylines,1416441600,,173,4.9655172413793105

2307091,5,B0009OL934,"Watched this as a young teen and it seems even better as an adult. Very little fakery (though cuteness happens here and there) ti captured the feel of the time period and even feels relevant now. The current series has actors that are a bit too self-aware. This actors, mostly neophytes, give the show a cinema verite-like feel.",1408060800,,328,4.672413793103448
2307092,4,B0009OL934,"What's there to say that I have not said about that first two seasons?

The door to junior high is about to close, and the door to senior high is to open. The ups and downs of friendship and intimacy are clear as day and night. The need-to-know issues from racism and drinking to anorexia and depression to dealing with divorce and (do I dare say) sexual preference are top priority. No ""Beverly Hills 90210"" blues added or needed.

Joey is still learning the hard way. Wheels has begun his downward and upward spiraling following the tragic loss of his parents. Kathleen is too proud to admit she has problems. Lucy is going about the right and wrong ways of proving her self-suffiency. Spike is dealing with being a student and a mother, back and forth about whether Shane is in or out. Arthur and Yick, once the lightest of the guys in class, are each growing into their own--and so far liking their standings as bachelors. Melanie and Snake are yet to get past mono-syllables. Mr. Raditch is as professional as ever, like Mr. Feeny after him. Ms. Avery is  still laid-back, as long as no one or nothing gets on her bad side. Oh, and like students, parents, and teachers, school buildings are not perfect.

How much better would ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"" be if they stuck with the standards set by and with the original concept and class. A whole awful lot.",1405468800,,1366,4.563265306122449

2307094,4,B0009OL934,"Very cool show. It may have been made in the 80's/early 90's, but that is my generation of TV so it seems a lot more genuine to me. The characters are unforgettable and the story lines actually seem much more dramatic and believable. I love the show now but these older ones are definitely worth watching, especially if you are a true Degrassi fan.",1402617600,,348,4.453125
2307095,5,B0009OL934,Great as usual!  I love this wonderful series!  Characters are very realistic and I think would still appeal to today's kids!,1396396800,,125,4.904761904761905
2307096,5,B0009OL934,I have seen all of these eps when on PBS & on amazon prime more recently once again superb story lines & characters that tackle a vast capacity of teenage problems that occur in the real world it is not a picnic being a kid there are hardships sometimes. take a look everyone jump street is not the only high school series that dealt with this stuff sure think it is much better then 90210,1392854400,,389,4.2
2307097,5,B0009OL934,"I grew up watching this show when it was an afterschool staple on PBS in the 80s. The issues presented are still as relevant now as they were then, so quite a few of the episodes would be ideal for kids nowadays. Degrassi Junior High is awesome; fashion cheesiness, 80s terminology and all.",1388966400,,290,4.490566037735849
2307098,5,B0009OL934,"Final season of Junior High, Stephanie is finally gone, and we can get down to more interesting issues and dramas.  I liked this season a lot!

2307099,4,B0009OL934,"This show was made in the late 80's and had themes about teen sex, abortion, drinking, death, adoption, and others. However, the show was able to present these while still maintaining a touch of humor.
In my opinion this show was much better than the Degrassi shows which have been made since.",1380067200,,293,4.653846153846154
2307100,5,B0009OL934,This is just a very good show and would be good for kids today still.  They really address some good issues that still apply today and they do it in a very realistic way.  Definitely recommend this series.,1378598400,,205,4.368421052631579

2307102,5,B0009OL934,"Filmed in the 1980s in Canada this show was ahead of it's time.  It dealt with issues that impacted junior high schoolers (e.g.,AIDS, being gay, bullies, teen pregancy).

8064356,5,B0009OL934,It's a neat show and it's nice to see how degrassi started! The acting isn't the best but I think it was ran on like a PBS type station. This show is better than DTNG. The characters and storyline are a bit more realistic.,1461024000,,222,4.068181818181818

There is an uncensored use of the ""N word"" in the episode about race in season 3, so that's something to be aware of if you would be concerned about your child hearing that or find the word offensive yourself.",1452988800,,398,4.605633802816901
