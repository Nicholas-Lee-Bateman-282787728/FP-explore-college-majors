4854565,5,B005OT3FWM,"Pope approves Archbishop Sheen's heroic virtues, step toward sainthood

By Francis X. Rocca  Catholic News Service June 29 2012

VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Pope Benedict XVI has approved the heroic virtues of U.S. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, the Vatican announced June 28, clearing the way for the advancement of his sainthood cause.

Archbishop Sheen heroically lived Christian virtues and should be considered ""venerable,"" said a decree issued by the Congregation for Saints' Causes and signed by Pope Benedict. Before the archbishop can be beatified, the Vatican must recognize that a miracle has occurred through his intercession.

The decree came just more than 13 months after Bishop Daniel R. Jenky of Peoria, Ill., presented Pope Benedict with two thick volumes about the life of Archbishop Sheen, whose home diocese was Peoria.

Archbishop Sheen, who was born in Illinois in 1895 and died in New York in Dec 1979, was an Emmy-winning televangelist. His program, ""Life is Worth Living,"" aired in the United States from 1951 to 1957 and now re -aired on EWTN",1341878400,10,1060,5.133720930232558
