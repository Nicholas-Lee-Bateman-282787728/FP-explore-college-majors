8147214,5,B000ION2AS,"Abel Nightroad is a Cruznik. A vampire that feeds on the blood of other vampires. He is also a clergyman that fights to protect the humans. A organization is out to start a war between humanity and the nations that are ruled by the vampires. Abel and his friends must fight to protect humanity and the vampires from a war that could wipe out both races. Like it almost did 900 years ago.

This anime is beautifully done. The animation and voice acting are great. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. Like all the great animes this story has tons of great characters and very compelling story. There's nothing bad about it. I am shocked to see that there are people out there that didn't like this series. It's certainly different, but not one you'll soon forget.",1354752000,,760,4.547445255474453

Not a vampire though, A Samurai or sword dancer his nickname! a very fatal opponant when using his mysterious sword. I loved this episode. The rest of episodes deal with other stories till the last one, (not complete) in order for you to watch the third chapter. Again, it is interesting and full of suspense.",1175472000,,424,4.821917808219178

8147218,5,B000ION2AS,"So far Trinity Blood is has hit a homerun on the first eight episodes. For a series that I had plenty of doubts for, thinking it would turn out to be exactly like Hellsing and completely unoriginal period but it hasn't sopped impressing me. It's got something new every time, just when you think it's going in a predictable direction you're hit with something you  didn't see coming. The color and animation is perfect, the voice acting is good but could be better, and for it to have a back-story that's been heard before it excels expectations. Episode 5 starts off with tall, broke, and hungry Abel taking Sister Esther Blanchett to the Vatican to meet Caterina Sforza and others to become part of Ax. This is the more talkative episode on this DVD but everything that happens is of importance. In episode 2 Sword Dancer you're introduced to Father Hugue, one guy that is not to be messed with and trust me his skills are very sharp.

His preferred weapon is looks to be a long stick with nice carvings but somehow it can cut like a katana. Hugue is sent to investigate a murder that occurred on holy ground and ends up saving a girl that never forgets him, or maybe he doesn't save her, I can't remember. Trinity Blood vol. 2 actually ends with a very unpredictable seen. Something happens to Abel Nightroad that I thought would never be done but that's what I like the most about this series. You never know what's going to happen next and you never know what new characters will appear. I hope that Trinity Blood stays the way it is because if it does it will go down as a classic.
