4693047,5,B005GP7F5W,"Synopsis: Three homely spinsters live together after the death of their wealthy father. A smooth Tognazzi insinuates himself into their lives in order to marry one of them and is successful, but is not satisfied with bedding just one of them.

It is a delightful story, low-keyed. The town is set in northern Italy, which is beautiful and a nice change from the often seen arid Italian scenery of the southern peninsula.",1362355200,4,420,4.833333333333333
4693048,5,B005GP7F5W,"This is one of the funniest sex comedies to come out of Italy!  For a long time I had a copy of this film on VHS (which I got off Cinemax in the late '70s or early '80s) but in moving, it got misplaced and I never found it again.  Like the first reviewer I've been pleading for someone to release it on DVD.  AND NOW IT IS!

I could say a lot of great things about this movie, but let me sum it up as a CEO might to his top staff, after viewing the film to start a staff meeting...............

""Ladies and gentleman, there are two most important business lessons to be learned from this film!""  ""The first one is....Don't make the mistake of overreaching your resources attempting to expand your holdings, especially too quickly!""  And the second lesson is.....Always remember,  33-1/3% of something, is a whole lot better than 100% of nothing!""

I hope you buy/rent it and enjoy it as much as I have through the years.",1321401600,8,920,4.333333333333333

8472034,5,B005GP7F5W,"I remembered watching this movie in the 70's. And laughing often. Ugo Tognazi was a magnificent actor. The irony was he suffered from depression but was a terrific comedic actor. I bought the movie because is funny, witty and wanted to see it again after so many years. It didn't disappoint me and I had many laughs! He was also great in La Cage aux Follies.",1461542400,,358,4.4393939393939394

8472036,1,B005GP7F5W,"Freezing up, i got a replacement. Almost same problem. I did not ask for a refund, and I could not enjoy this movie fully in any of the 5 DVD players I have at home. Not sure what the problem is with this DVD, but I would not recommend to be purchased.",1455926400,,252,3.8653846153846154
8472037,4,B005GP7F5W,"I like the movie, it is a classic.  Well done, and the information and small details of it are very interesting, it is an excellent movie.  However,  the DVD fail to run after couple times that we saw it. My DVD player and my computer cannot run it any more.",1423958400,,258,4.12
8472038,3,B005GP7F5W,"nothing is wrong with movie , I saw it before and it is still fun , but this dvd  is atrocious.it wouldn't play on computer player , and on other players I have - it stopped and proceeds frame by frame for a while , taking all fun off.

8472040,5,B005GP7F5W,"DVD arrived quickly and in excellent condition.

This is one of my all time favorite Italian comedies. I have been waiting for years to see it come out in DVD. It has, and I own it!
Ugo Tognazzi is at his best in  this film. Better than his role in La Cage au Foilles.

Get it--you won't be disappointed!",1400544000,2,304,4.11864406779661
8472041,5,B005GP7F5W,"Good film. I will classify this one as a black-comedy/tragic-comedy.
The film is directed towards a mature audience with a spunk for finer things...or those who seek lavish life style.
The main character in this movie reminded me a little of Bertrand Morane from THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN (1977).
A middle age guy who has a thing for women, while at the same time is seeking to settle down with single woman who is rich enough to make his life easier.  I do not know if  that is an oxymoron, but it sure sound like the protagonist has a life-dilemma.
In addition, COME HAVE COFFEE WITH US, has some great sequences capturing bourgeois life in modern day Italy, where
eating together at the table seems to be the essence of the ordinary day.

To summarize the movie for an ordinary Joe: lots of conversations while eating food, lots of  'censored' sex scenes, and ending that will leave you either laughing or thinking.",1386028800,,916,4.601226993865031
8472042,1,B005GP7F5W,"I'm trying to learn Italian and it didn't bother me particularly that you can't see more than a few words of the subtitles on the screen - I figured I would just have to work harder to figure out the dialogue. That part was fine. BUT when the video stopped working - the screem turned into mosaics for a while - I was still ok because it began to work again. The second time it did this, it did not ever start again - I got tired of waiting. The DVD was brand new so it shouldn't have had any fingerprints or anything on it. Usually I wash discs off with Joy detergent and dry with a soft cloth and they're fine, but I'm out of luck here because I bought it in August and just now getting around to watching. Sold by Newbury Comics. Went to web and no way to contact them for a return. Won't be buying from them again.",1381881600,,818,4.024539877300613
8472043,2,B005GP7F5W,"A friend recommended this as a funny movie from the 70's. But it is too slow, and the humor belongs to another generation, or culture.",1364860800,,134,4.4
