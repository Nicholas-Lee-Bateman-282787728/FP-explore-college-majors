2796961,5,B000OIOOVO,"The outrageous misadventures of comedian Jerry Seinfeld (himself) and his close group of eccentric friends continue with ""Seinfeld: The Complete Eighth Season"". ""Seinfeld"" follows the lives of stand-up comedian Jerry Seinfeld (Himself) and his close group of eccentric friends going through everyday life in New York City. In this hilarious season, Jerry enters a weightlifting competition with an 80-year-old athlete who can't stand to lose. Elaine (Julia Louis Dreyfus) holds an office party for her co-workers where she loses respect when they see her bizarre dancing style. After being offered a position with the Mets, George (Jason Alexander) tries to make a big exit from the Yankee organization. Kramer (Michael Richards) gets a pet rooster that he names Little Jerry Seinfeld. ""Seinfeld"" is the award-winning creation of producer Larry David and star Jerry Seinfeld. In its eighth season, the comedy sitcom continued to draw a large viewing audience every Thursday nights. The eighth season features some amusing storylines, memorable characters, great humor and guest appearances by Kristen Davis, Derek Jeter, Debra Messing, Christine Taylor, Amanda Peet, Robert Wagner and Lloyd Bridges.

""Seinfeld: The Complete Eighth Season"" is an absolute purchase for any fan of the popular comedy series. All 23 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. Like the previous box sets, the episodes look great and the 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is clear and well balanced. Among special features, the 4-disc box set includes the 23-minute ""Jerry Seinfeld: Submarine Captain"" documentary, deleted scenes, various behind-the-scenes featurettes, a 26-minute blooper reel and 13 informative episode commentaries by the show's cast, producers and writers. Overall, ""Seinfeld: The Complete Eighth Season"" scores a worthy ""A"".",1180656000,22,1832,5.661818181818182
2796962,5,B000OIOOVO,"It's the first without Larry David, but this eighth season of ""Seinfeld"" is still worthy. Certainly the departure of its co-creator, executive producer and longtime writer changed the show -- there's a faster pace, more fantasy storylines and more slapstick humor -- but the actors (especially, in this season, Julia Louis Dreyfus) are still so in their zones that every episode is fun to watch.

In fact, many Season Eight episodes are among the show's best ever. ""The Little Kicks"" features Elaine's infamous dancing.  Kramer gets involved in cockfighting in ""The Little Jerry."" Elaine discovers the menace of muffin tops in, of course, ""The Muffin Tops.""

Here's the entire Season Eight episode list:
* Episode 1: The Foundation
* Episode 2: The Soul Mate
* Episode 3: The Bizarro Jerry
* Episode 4: The Little Kicks
* Episode 5: The Package
* Episode 6: The Fatigues
* Episode 7: The Checks
* Episode 8: The Chicken Roaster
* Episode 9: The Abstinence
* Episode 10: The Andrea Doria
* Episode 11: The Little Jerry
* Episode 12: The Money
* Episode 13: The Comeback
* Episode 14: The Van Buren Boys

As for bonus features, a documentary short interviews various supporting actors and show execs about the impact of David's departure. As with the DVDs for earlier seasons, there are also episode-specific comments and deleted scenes.",1180569600,32,1563,4.756457564575646
2796963,4,B000OIOOVO,"so right as season seven was about to be released, michael richards let out his latent racist-animal side and turned me off to seinfeld for a good while. but, my boycott ended yesterday when i saw season 8 on sale before intended at a local store. i have only watched the first disc, so far. and i can't wait to get into the extras...richards was a genius part of the show and i hope his race baiting ways are at an end.

2796964,5,B000OIOOVO,"Seinfeld just keeps getting better.  I observed no significant differences with the departure of Larry David.  Seinfeld and David put together some great episodes; hovewever, many of the best episodes are from the last two seasons.

I don't understand the previous reviewer's comments regarding the wackiness of the show after David left.  In my mind, the essence of Seinfeld is wackiness: it's that over-the-top character of the show and characters that makes this one of the greatest, most enduring TV shows in the American experience.",1179532800,5,537,5.2823529411764705
2796965,5,B000OIOOVO,"""Seinfeld"" did a pretty good job rebounding from Larry David's departure from the show. Jerry doesn't have as many segments featured around him this season, possibly because of the stepped up demands on his time behind the camera. However, the ones in which he is featured are very funny. For example, Jerry has a check bounce, and the unfriendly merchant puts the returned check on display in his store. Word gets back to Jerry's parents, and they jump to conclusions and decide that Jerry must be broke. Jerry's dad decides to return to work to help support Jerry. Unfortunately, the job his dad takes is working for Elaine, and the situation doesn't work out for anyone.

George, reeling from the mixed emotions he had at losing Susan at the end of season seven, prepares to go on without her, but finds that he really can't. Instead, Susan's parents start a charitable foundation in her memory and have George installed on the board with a large framed photograph of Susan framed on the wall in the room where the foundation meetings are held. Later in the season, George does meet a woman he is interested in, and she seems to be interested in him. George, always trying to better his position through lying but usually just worsening his lot because of it, does the same thing in this instance. The woman believes George is a tourist from Arkansas, and George decides to continue the deception by faking a move to the city so he can continue the relationship. The way George sees it, if you condense everything he has accomplished in the last ten years into just a few weeks, it seems quite impressive.

Elaine enters an alternate universe when she meets Kevin and his friends, who turn out to be the opposite of Jerry and his friends in every way. She likes the fact that Kevin and his friends inspire her to be a better person - they are genuinely kind and helpful and they enjoy reading. However, ultimately Elaine is just not cut out to be among them because of her own selfish personality traits. Perhaps the funniest episode featuring Elaine is ""The English Patient"", titled after the Best Picture winner of 1996. Her boss, the eccentric Peterman, loves the film and forces her to go see it with him. Elaine hates the movie, and just can't take sitting through it in its entirety without blurting out how she feels. Peterman gives her a chance to do penance for her bad attitude which involves a most hilarious assignment. In ""The Susie"", due to a series of mix-ups, Elaine winds up with an alternate identity at work - ""Susie"". Her coworkers begin discussing her as though Elaine and Susie are two different people. Her ultimate solution to the problem is to have Susie ""die"", complete with a memorial service for the fictitious woman that winds up packed with mourners.

Of course, Kramer's adventures are as unbelievable as ever. This season his apartment turns into ""The Red Planet"" due to a neon sign from the Kenny Rogers Roasters restaurant shining through his window all night. At first he is doing everything he can to put the restaurant out of business, but when he and Jerry temporarily switch apartments the pressure is off, and Kramer finds himself addicted to the restaurant's food. In another episode, Elaine's boss Jay Peterman is trying to write his memoirs, but finds his own life isn't very interesting. His solution is to buy Kramer's life story and use it as his own. Kramer and Peterman eventually get into an argument over the details of the  arrangement, and Kramer answers back by starting his own ""Peterman Reality Tours"". Finally, Kramer is incensed by the fact that he can no longer find a public place in which he can light up a cigar, and opens a smoking lounge in his own apartment. As a result of all of the exposure to tobacco smoke, Kramer ages prematurely and goes to his attorney friend, the fast-talking and flamboyant Jackie Chiles, to file suit against the tobacco companies. When Kramer negotiates a deal with the tobacco companies without Jackie's approval, Jackie declares the results to be ""the most public of his many humiliations"".

In summary, this season is very good with more of an emphasis on fast-paced zaniness rather than the comedy that made more of a commentary on human nature that you saw during the Larry David years. However, I still highly recommend it.",1176595200,54,4325,4.7383798140770255
2796966,5,B000OIOOVO,"This is the best TV possible. Season 8 is the Seinfeld genius at full capacity. This is Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine at the top of their game.

This was the season where we get Elaine's little kicks, George poses for his photo shop admirer, Frank returning to cooking (perhaps my favorite episode), George showing an Adrea Doria survivor a thing or two about traumatic experiences, little Jerry Seinfeld, Morty working at Peterman's, ""Jerkstore,"" George and Kramer suggesting the department store management trainee position to Jerry, ""Susie,"" Kramer adopting a stretch of the expressway, the Mandelbaum crepes, Whatley converting to judiasm, the Newmanium, muffin tops and Kramer wins a Tony...

It's amazing stuff. I couldn't recommend anything any higher than this.  It's the funniest stuff that's ever been done.",1176076800,19,820,5.341085271317829
2796967,5,B000OIOOVO,"This show started as an exemplary slow-burner, and the next thing you knew - yada yada yada - it became a cultural phenomenon. There is something you may call a Seinfeld experience, and I want to appraise the 8th installment of it.

The eight season marked two departures: one of the co-creator/scriptwriter/producer Larry David, and second of the show itself into the realm of pure wackiness. The season seven much-maligned finale, 'The Invitations' (S07E22), can be properly understood only in the context of general quality of season eight, which was one of craziness let loose. Susan's death marked the exact moment in which the entire show made 'ping!', and flew way off into the space of absurd. From the word go in 8ht's season's opener, 'The Foundation (S08E01)', there is no way you can relate to the characters as real people. Right until the very last episode they will be first and foremost CHARACTERS - ones we all love and we all laugh our brains out at - but, nonetheless, CHARACTERS. In all of the previous seasons - despite the famous claim that it's all about nothing - there was a sense that IF any of those people encounter a real-life tragedy that touches them personally, they would stop cracking jokes and cry just as you or me would (remember Elaine's tears shed on behalf of the bubble boy...?). 'The Invitations' proved otherwise and the show really became one about nothing: just the four pop-culture characters thrown into wackier and wackier situations. To my mind, this time no Sein-imation is needed, since season 8 (and 9) simply is the live-action equivalent of traditional cartoon.

And what a cartoon it is! One of the benefits of a then well-established mega-popularity of the show is the delight the screenwriters take in self-references. One of the most hilarious episodes of this season, 'The Bizarro Jerry' (S08E03), is the best example of what I'm talking about. It takes for granted our familiarity with all the patterns, all the characters and all the soundstages even - and twirls them around in a way that makes the entire episode a comment on the Seinfeld universe itself. By showing us the opposite (ha!) of Jerry's world within the 'Seinfeld' world, and laughing it up, the show gives a finger to all the reality that didn't absorb Seinfeld and even had the nerve to denounce it's mastery (of the domain). And no, I'm not misinterpreting the show's nose-scratching for an offensive gesture (or even for an actual pick).

The key word to the last two seasons of Seinfeld is irony: the show has become so self-aware, that it could go either way: mocking itself, mythologizing itself, aping itself - and the audience would love it even more than before because it was all so wacky and so familiar at the same time. The ideas were so crazy you sometimes went ""Sweet holy Moses"" - but the little kicks never stopped. And we all loved every minute of them.

The 8 & 9 season are my favourites. To my mind they simply are the muffin tops: with all the stems of society, emotion and common sense neatly sliced off. M-m!

He wasn't sure if he could manage the additional work load.  Jerry also said that they started taking more risks, which they did.  Seasons 8 and 9 are loaded with some of the most hysterical, and outrageous episodes.  However they don't get too ridiculous or over the top.  Seinfeld would have a great legacy if it only lasted 7 seasons, but it is the final two seasons that push it over the edge into being probably the best sitcom in TV history.",1436659200,6,565,4.394230769230769

2797056,5,B000OIOOVO,"Hi,  I have been a fan of Seinfeld from the beginning, and watched it regularly when it was on tv.  Whenever I got a chance to see an old rerun, I took advantage of it.  This was such a funny show, and all the characters were great.  I was very happy to find it had been put on dvd, and I started to collect the seasons little by little.  I have finally gotten down to the last two seasons, and had to have them both.  Now I can watch them over and over, and never get tired of seeing them and laughing out loud.

Also more writers were hired for the series, so the stories got more off-the-wall.  This series will give you a good chuckle for sure.  I especially love the physical coomedy of Kramer.  Oh, yeah!

2797084,4,B000OIOOVO,"Despite no longer having Larry David's creative input (he still played the voice of Steinbrenner though), Seinfeld remained the funniest show on television. In this season, the storylines became a little more far fetched and occasionally bordered on the ridiculous. The show remained very funny and consistent but the highs didn't peak as high as they did on the previous five seasons. Still there is much to be loved and there are many strong episodes, most notably ""The Abstinence"", ""The Package"", ""The Little Jerry"", ""The Millenium"", and ""The Muffin Tops"". The best television ensemble still don't learn from their neuroses or mistakes which continues to lead to great comedy. Also worth noting is that the less visible characters such as the Costanzas, the Seinfelds, J. Peterman, and Newman have a lot of memorable scenes. And as with all the seasons, the special features are top notch with plenty of inside looks, bloopers, and deleted scenes. If you love Seinfeld, all of the seasons are worth owning and Season 8 continues to bring it.",1390780800,4,1044,5.040462427745664

About halfway through season 8 the storylines get heavy with some incoherences in scenario, predictable plots and lines or jokes that just do not work (The Little Jerry episode for example)...The 4some looks kind of tired onscreen and seem to act without conviction, just going through the motions.

  If you liked the show (and I loved it), you may have missed an episode here and there so now you can see them all and go back to the good old days of real funny TV. A show about nothing - Only a Genius like Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David could pull this off on network TV without a single cuss word. Classic material and a simply incredible cast make this a must see again and again and again.
  And if you've never seen this show you owe it to yourself to see it now.

BE SURE of your order w/Amazon b/c I only got about $4 back.  They would only let me do a return, not an exchange (for Season 9).  I had to pay S/H (even though I did not have to the first time) AND a restocking fee!  I knew about S/H when I did the return but not the restocking fee.  Had I known all that, I may have kept it for a gift for someone else!

I will be buying Season 9 elsewhere or at a much later time since I only have $4 to put towards it!

You'll probably sit through the first disc with a smirk on your face, but few season 3-7 type laughs. Even the audience laughter on this season is canned.  A REALLY bad sign. Even Kramer's entrances seem forced.

Look, ya gotta see it. And if you already own Seasons 1-7, you have to own it. But Jerry and the gang were already past their creative peak.

Jerry knew it too.  He tried it for one more year - but even he couldn't bring himself to round it off with a Tenth Season.

While these are all valid points, nonetheless, having watched this season recently, it made me laugh as much as any other. Maybe we're in danger of focussing on the trees and missing the forest - despite all the negatives, Seinfeld remained, and still remains, absolutely hilarious. How many other shows from the 90s bear rewatching now, and manage to retain the charm and humour they had at the time? Very few, it seems to me.

Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!

Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.

No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).

Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, ""Seinfeld"" *was* a ""show about nothing"" -- in every sense of the word:

The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.

The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.

Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as ""Exhibit A.""  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.

Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!

Pathetic.

And, ""Elaine""?

Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.

This is the first season that was made without Larry David.  You can sort of sense something is different in the first few episodes, but then after that they hit such an amazing stride that you hardly miss him.  (Sorry LD!  You're still a genius in my book!)  The writing for this season is sheer genius.  Every single episode is an utter masterpiece.  Additionally, the cast performs everything flawlessly.  It's polished perfection!

The only reason that I do not give it five stars is because, in my opinion, there's no way, NO WAY, this season is better than Season Seven.

Yes, I understand the changes after Larry David left the show, I understand the approach to writing was different, I understand the show was still VERY good, entertaining, unbeliavably funny. But I think seasons 5, 6 and 7 were better.

Anyway, Seinfeld Eight is head and shoulders above the competition in terms of sitcoms. It was an unique moment in television history, one that will not repeat itself anymore.",1183075200,3,610,4.735849056603773
2797180,5,B000OIOOVO,"Finally, we hold it in our hands, the 8th season of maybe the best sitcom ever created.
In season 8, cast and crew, and especially the writers, found themselves in an awkward position. On one hand, they had just finished what some consider Seinfeld's best season (number 7), and a successful season 8 was almost guaranteed, but on the other hand, half of the series' genius spirit, Larry David, had just left the show.
As it is mentioned in the fantastic featurette ""Jerry Seinfeld: Submarine Captain"", this meant a total restructuring of the writing process. Unlike in the previous seven seasons, where Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld would revise other writers' scripts and have the final saying, season 8 is much more of a team effort.
That also meant much more storylines of the individual writers would get to the editing room as they were conceived by them.
The result is a show that takes all the characters' qualities, and human misbehaviours that were established in earlier seasons, and turns them almost into a life action cartoon.
In The Comeback for instance, when the writers take George's envy and (previously subtle) anger, and make it larger than life, so that in the end, he flies from New York to Akron, Ohio, just to come back at a guy with a witty one-liner that he didn't think of earlier.

I always enjoy the audio commentaries, of which there are far more in this season than in season 7, and I like it how the writers aren't shy of criticising themselves. That's really an attitude that I don't think anyone but Seinfeld writers can have.
In The Bizarro Jerry, for instance, writer David Mandel charmingly explains, without rest or full stop, why season 8 and 9 have a different feeling, and how the show commented on itself.
Tom Gamill and Max Pross, whose first episode was ""The Glasses"", have their last show in this season, and quite frankly, I think that was for the better. The ""Notes About Nothing"" subtitles list all their episodes, and to my surprise I discovered that they had written all the episodes that I found least enjoyable and too far out there.

Now, I find seasons 8 and 9 as hilarious and great as all seasons gone before, but for different reasons. And director Andy Ackerman describes it perfectly when he says that they felt like the teacher had gone out of the classroom, and the students could now have some fun.
And by god, they did!
They took all the pure comedy potential the characters always had, and milked it completely dry.

I also find that the final three seasons featured the series' best permanent characters: ""Jacopo"" Peterman (""Where is my pineapple?"") and George Steinbrenner (""Big Stein can't be floppin' and twitchin'!"")
A human caricature like Peterman could never work in seasons 1 through 6.

That being said, I know very well that some people think the show lost its zing, and I fully understand why they think that. This Seinfeld is not a different Seinfeld, but Seinfeld brought to the brink of the absurd. The thing is, the characters and their unbreakable bond of unfounded hostility (formerly the almost inperceptible cruelty of daily life) are so strong that they can take it without collapsing. Even more, I think the separation of the storylines into four distinct ones for every character brought each actor to his or her full blossoming.

But that, make no mistake, goes all to the expense of the ensemble performance.
Every character has much to do in each episode, which contradicts the series' label as the ""show about nothing"". They all have their hands full, and that's a huge part of why season 8 feels different.
Some people may tell you that all storylines are intertwined. That's not quite the truth. Yes, they come together in the end, but before that, each character goes his own way.
In rewatching early seasons, you'll find that Seinfeld's best moments were always the ensemble moments, when two people more or less had the same or (in Kramer's case) no storyline. Remember George and Kramer visiting the busboy? Or Jerry and Elaine in The Pen? Or Jerry, George and Kramer at Ackman the healer? Or the Jerry/George scenes with the NBC executives?
And lengthier face to face conversations are very rare now, too. It all more or less boils down to a daily debrief at the coffee shop. Why? Because there's too much stuff squeezed into the 20 minutes.

And yet, the characters never lost their ""twinkle"" amongst the mayhem, and that's why we love it.

The extras are excellent, as usual. The ""Exclusive Stand-Up"" material is missing, of course, since the show didn't have stand-up anymore.
I know I'll shed a tear or two when I hold season 9 in my hands. Originally, Jerry thought season 8 was going to be the last one, but we're all glad that he decided to add a bonus year, aren't we?",1182988800,3,4776,4.7262905162064826
2797181,4,B000OIOOVO,By the 8th season Seinfield had become very inconsistent. Still there are enough storylines and jokes packed into every episode to make it worthwhile.

2797184,5,B000OIOOVO,"With every season's release, I eagerly awaited Season Eight for this simple reason:  in my mind it stood out as the funniest, wackiest and most memorable of all.  Aside from pure hilarity in his delivery, Seinfeld had the incredible ability to make simple thoughts and actions seem funny; things that might occur to you in your daily life, like The Muffin Top idea, was turned into a non-stop joke.  Larry David's departure didn't impact the show adversely and the ensemble cast, one of the finest in television history, continue to work seamlessly together to deliver scene upon scene of laughter.  Through the nearly 10 years that Seinfeld has been off the air, I continue to hear every day references in conversation to his classic lines, i.e., Not That There's Anything Wrong With That, Yada Yada, I'm a Day Person..... and the list goes on and on.

Those are actually some of the most remembered episodes ever, up there with the Soup Nazi and The Contest.

I can't say anything good about this set that hasn't already been said, but i will say this..the episode ""The Checks"" still features actual Eagles music! The cost of licensing obviously didn't bother jerry too much, of course it wouldn't made much sense including it with crappy replacement music!
