3417749,4,B0018M6J9K,"Transformers Cybertron: The Ultimate Collection is the third and final series in the Unicron Trilogy that began with Transformers: Armada and Transformers: Energon.  The boxed set includes all 52 episodes of the show, known in Japan as Transformers: Galaxy Force.  Like Transformers: Energon, the show was produced with a combination of traditional cell animation for the human characters and backgrounds and computer-generated animation for the Transformers.

Cybertron represents yet another reboot of Transformer history which Transformers fans should be used to by now.  Generation One was great but long gone.  The bottom line goal of Hasbro and Takara is to sell toys and if that means constantly re-writing history, then that is what they are going to do.

The show picks up just after the conclusion of Energon.  The destruction of Unicron has resulted in the creation of a massive black hole, which threatens to destroy Cybertron.  The Autobots are attempting to evacuate the planet when an ancient Autobot, Vector Prime appears.  Vector Prime was one of the original Transformers created by their God, Primus.  Vector Prime is so ancient that he runs on clockwork gears.  He informs the Transformers that the only way to stop the black hole is to locate the Cyber Planet Keys, ancient artifacts formed from the spark of Primus himself.  The Cyber Keys have been lost for eons and are now their only hope.  The Transformers escape to earth where they can different vehicles in order to blend in on their new world.  It's not long before Megatron, Starscream, and Thundercracker arrive on Earth looking for the Cyber Planet Keys as well in order to destroy the universe.

Thus begins the central plot of Tranformers: Cybertron, the search for the Cyber Plant Keys and the Omega Lock that controls the keys.  The action is truly universal in the show.  The Transformers will travel to distant planets in search of the keys.  Planets that strangely are home to other, previously unknown Transformers.  These include Velocitron, the Speed Planet, led by Ovverride; The Jungle Planet led by Scourge; and Gigantion or The Giant Planet, whose leader is the massive Transformer Metroplex.  Each of these planets is found to be home to one of the Cyber Planet Keys and in turn, battles are fought between the Autobots and Decepticons to find the artifacts.  New enemies and allies are gained on each of the new worlds, as Transformer lore is re-written.

The discovery of the Cyber Keys leads to the discovery of Cyber key powers.  These powers are unique to each Transformer and enhance their abilities or provide new ones.  One Earth the Transformers soon make friends with some local kids: Bud, Coby, and Lori because you can't have a show about giant robots without kids getting in the way.  Yes they do tend to be the most annoying part of the show but often times their involvement is minimal.

There are a LOT of transformers in Cyberton.  The cast is huge and the fact that they are from different worlds allows them to be grouped somewhat logically by type.  For example the Transformers of Jungle Planet took the forms of beasts rather than vehicles such as Scourge who transforms into a dragon and Snarl, who transforms into a wolf.  Yes, all names that have been used before in every series since G1 and always in a new form.  All the better to sell toys!

At first it might seem that the quest plot might be too thin to carry the show through 52 episodes but the action moves along surprisingly well.  The different planets all make for fresh landscapes to battle within and new Transformers to discover.  During the course of the show there are a number of Transformers who even re-format into new characters and forms, keeping things interesting.

The voice acting is quite good with Gary Chalk returning as Optimus Prime although the strange accents are confounding such as Jetfire's heavy Australian accent.  I was half expecting him to exclaim ""By Crikey!"" at some point.  Jetfire's cargo plane form is also disappointing and a far cry from the VF-1S Valkyrie of the original.

The animation is fluid and the combination of the cell and computer animation is seemless and as good as many of the Japanese Anime shows.  Transformers Cybertron showed that both Takara and Hasbro were committed to co-producing a quality show which had a depth of plot and characterization better than any other Transformers show since Beast Wars.  Oh, it's not perfect.  The repeated used of the same transforming sequences, especially Optimus Prime's, gets old after about a half dozen episodes and you realize you still have 46 to go!  Also, there are no extras of any kind in the seven-disc set.  No commentaries, no deleted scenes, nothing.  Hasbro and Takara HAVE to do more to appeal to collectors and adult fans.  All in all, the best Transformers show since Beast Wars",1233014400,,4874,4.905867970660147
3417750,3,B0018M6J9K,"I never watched this show when it was on air, but I figured ""it's Transformers, it's gotta be good."" As compared to G1 and Beast Wars the seriousness has almost completely gone out the window and replaced with a campiness often found within anime aimed at young kids. Not terrible to watch, just don't expect much depth.",1223078400,,320,4.631578947368421
3417751,4,B0018M6J9K,"As a big fan of Transformers Beast Wars, I was very pleased that Gary Chalk (Optimus Primal) and David Kaye (Megatron) were back for this series to voice Prime and Megatron again.  Nice.  The Cybertron toy line was pretty decent so if you have some of those toys then this is a nice complement (as it gets into the Planet Keys which were the big action feature gimmick for the toy line).  My kid and I like the way they use cel animation for the 'bots overlapped on the anime style of the humans and backgrounds.  The price is right if you're considering a purchase (mostly for owners of the toys); otherwise it would be a decent rental for the 7+ crowd in your house.  Alot of the Cybertron series toys were repainted and made available again at retail in 2008.  Note regarding potential Disc 1 Defect:
For those of who have an issue with the first disc of their seven-disc ""Transformers Cybertron: The Ultimate Collection"" DVD box set, a solution is coming to you. TV Shows On DVD reports that Paramount Home Entertainment will replace the first disc, which is missing the first seven minutes of episode 3, ""Hidden.""

If you have this issue, you may call the studio's consumer hotline at 1-866-939-0931 beginning September 8th.

Tell the representative why you are calling and you will be asked the following information: name, shipping address, telephone number, and ISBN and UPC code off the box to identify if you are in possession of a faulty set (not that you're lying or anything).",1220832000,12,1489,4.656488549618321
3417752,5,B0018M6J9K,"I've noticed a lot of reviews on other sites that are calling ""Transformers Cybertron"" the worst.  A lot of these reviewers haven't really watched a ""Transformers"" animation since the first series back in the 80's or ""Beast Wars"" in the 90's.

But of all series, ""Transformers Cybertron"" (aka Transformers: Galaxy Force in Japan) is one of my favorite ""Transformers"" animation series since the original G1 series.

Like most ""Transformers"" series, the target are children and hopes for children to buy the toys.  But of course, among the older and hardcore collectors, this anime was so cool because it would introduce so many characters and also feature a large amount of Transformers merchandise.

The series focus on three young humans Coby (the teenager gifted at mechanics), his younger brother Bud (your typical young child) and Lori (a teenage friend of Coby and obviously she likes him.  And a person that can easily get frustrated).

To make a long story short, the autobots have evacuated to the Planet Earth after the destruction of Unicron has left a black hole.  With the black hole threatening their planet, the Autobots must find a way to stop the black hole from devouring their planet and the whole universe.

The three humans discover the Autobots and after developing trust and friendship, the humans assist the Optimus Prime and the other Autobots who are trying to find the legendary Cyber Planet Keys and Omega Lock thanks to the help of an ancient Autobot named Vector Prime.  Of course, the Decepticons are after the same thing.

The four Cyber Planet keys are scattered in four worlds.  Planet Earth, the Speed Planet (Velocitron), the Jungle Planet and Gigantion, the Giant Planet.

And the adventure focuses on the search for the keys and Omega Lock but at the same time, with each planet, introducing more characters (Autobot, Decepticon or neutral), as well as other earthlings who are curious about the alien robots.

The series is quite long and in Japan, typically the anime with longer series are typically good for merchandise sales.  May it be ""Gundam"", ""Pokemon"" or ""Naruto"", the same here in the US as a lot of ""Transformers Cybertron"" merchandise came out and if you were a collector of the line, to have so many Transformers (Autobots and Decepticons) from the various planets, small, tall or humongous was just satisfying.

As an adult, I enjoyed this series and as a father, my son was introduced to Transformers because of this series.

There are many battles, there are some Transformer deaths as well.  But overall, the series was enjoyable if you stayed in it for the long haul.

There are some differences between the Japanese and American animations aside from character names and opening and ending themes but one difference is the leader of Velocitron (Speed Planet) in the US version is Override (a female Autobot) but in the Japanese version Override aka Nitro Convoy is a male character.

But all in all, I found ""Transformers Cybertron"" to be enjoyable, as a fan of the series and a fan of mecha, is the sheer number of robots introduced in this series.

A little bit of inclusion of things from the past such as combining Transformers that would combine with Optimus Prime or Megatron, the addition of minicons and much more.

As for the DVD, the video quality is as expected for a newer series.  The animation is colorful, vibrant.  The series featured more dialog and music, so don't expect any major audio channels.

I was disappointed that there are no special features.  That would have been cool to feature something but there are no special features included.

But still, you do get a lot of episodes in this ultimate collection and the price to obtain it online is much lower than retail.

Granted, those who are coming into this series thinking of the old school Transformers may or may not get into it and I can understand why some reviewers may dislike it.  But for those who are ""Transformers"" fans and also a collector of the merchandise, the series was one of the better ones to come in a long time in my opinion.",1218585600,16,4081,4.831654676258993
3417753,5,B0018M6J9K,"This is definitely the best transformers animated.
It is unique, introducing cyber key to activate special power
And the story is really top notch
The ending is really the best...the duel of Optimus Prime and Galvatron
The duel is really different compare to the duel before, it is really
superb.
And also Cybertron toy line is the best seller compare to other series.
Leobreaker, Wingsaber, the combination with Optimus Prime
The racing team, the defense team, Sideways and Soundwave
Really, really cool
Must see dvd series",1218585600,,524,5.104651162790698
3417754,3,B0018M6J9K,"First off, for this many episodes of transformers in one complete set, you can't beat the price tag. There are no extras with this set. No commentary, no special features, not even the original Japanese dialog with new subtitles. It isn't in widescreen format, either. However,  it's still a good bargain.

As far as the series itself goes, Cybertron had it's ups and downs. It starts off slow (though still not nearly as slow as Armada) and it clearly separates itself from the previous two shows right off the bat. From what I understand, Takara wanted to take the show in a new direction and toss out the previous continuity (as is tradition with Japanese kid shows) whereas Hasbro wanted to continue the same story. The conflict results in more then a few plot holes in the English version. Also, like Armada, the main characters of the series are three human children, and the transformers fill in as support cast. While the children aren't as over-the-top as the ones from Armada, they still steal the spotlight in almost every episode, resulting in another severely dumbed-down series.

If you can tolerate the children, the rest of the story isn't half bad. Autobots and Decepticons clash across the galaxy, fighting in just about every type of environment you can imagine. The action scenes and special effects are top-notch. Voice acting is so-so, as random transformers are assigned random accents, which more often then not come off as cheesy. It's clearly a show angled at very young children.

In the end, the price is well worth it just for the special effects, as long as you can tolerate Transformers being commanded by young human children.",1218153600,,1658,4.868794326241135
3417755,5,B0018M6J9K,"Translated and modified slightly from Japan's Galaxy Force series, Cybertron holds up very well as a stand-alone series that is loosely connected to its two predecesors (Armada and Energon).  Other than a handful of references to Unicron and a fleeting cameo of aged versions of the humans from the prior series, there isn't anything that ties it to the other shows.  I imagine that's why Paramount saw fit to package this set as such.

Cybertron draws some notable plot points and character references from the Marvel Comics continuity, as did Energon before it, and blends in bits and pieces in nostalgic homage to the original animated series.  Its story arcs are heavily serialized, so it's nice to have the whole series in one package -- Energon is spread in incongruous bits and pieces across four discs; Armada is in two halves which, in my opinion, are pretty overpriced anywhere you can find them; and there'll probably never be definitive set of Robots in Disguise DVDs given the nature of the first few episodes in relation to 9/11.

I'm not a particular fan of the Japanese shows that have been brought over after the end of Beast Machines.  I liked overall story and animation of Robots in Disguise, but there were far too many goofy childrens' anime moments for my taste.  I couldn't keep up with Armada because it was just hard to look at; even those few episodes of the original series that didn't look quite right never looked that bad.  I did like that the voiceover cast from the Mainframe shows was brought over, however.  As far as Energon is concerned, I wasn't able to catch a lot of it, but from what I saw it seemed pretty decent; I enjoyed the leap to the CG-cel animation and the story was pretty interesting for the most part.

But Cybertron is hands-down the best Transformers series from Japan to air in the US -- the story arcs are well paced and the animation is breathtaking.  Though unavoidable, what few silly anime moments that are there are tolerable.  As a hardcore TF fan, I heartily endorse Cybertron; even though it's clearly not canon to the original TV shows (Gen. 1 through Beast Machines), it's a fun, well thought out riff on the franchise as a whole.  Fans will enjoy the little echoes from the original show and movie that the translators wrote in.

One product side note: the last episode on the last disc (""Inferno"") is a repeat of an early episode; the series ends with the penultimate episode on the disc.",1217980800,,2457,4.6705336426914155
