2559553,4,B000FBHCAK,Final Destination is excellent for those who like gore and blood.  My husband and daughter do.,1185321600,2,94,4.875
2559554,5,B000FBHCAK,The movie is so scary.  If you don't want to be scared out of your wits this is not for you.  The special effects are terrific.  Can't wait for the next one?,1168819200,,157,3.84375
2559555,5,B000FBHCAK,"Well, we had already watched all the movies separately but we decided to purchase the trilogy for our nephew as a birthday gift since he loves this kind of horror/terror/thriller movies.

I'd classify Final Destination more like a thriller than horror, and it is not those silly and disgusting horror movies like See no Evil or Saw...

I do believe if you watch number one and like it (I bet you will) you more than likely would be the kind of viewer who would love to have the trilogy.",1163980800,,486,4.449438202247191
2559556,5,B000FBHCAK,The Final Destination Thrill-Ogy is exactly what I expected!  I saw all 3 movies and knew when this 3-pack came out that I would be purchasing it.  The movies are full of suspense and heart-pounding scenes that you'll have to rewind to believe again and again.  Great set of movies for those who enjoy these type of movies.  Great buy!,1162512000,3,335,4.533333333333333
2559557,5,B000FBHCAK,wonderful collection brand new when i purchase it all 3 of the final destinations where good but my favorite 1 is  final destination 3 that was the best one,1161993600,,156,4.379310344827586
2559558,5,B000FBHCAK,This was a great purchase.  The movies are all my favorites and I was pleased to finally get them all in a boxed set.  If there's ever a final destination 4; i will surely buy that as well.  Amazon is the best and they always have what i'm looking for.,1156809600,,252,4.0
2559559,5,B000FBHCAK,"the Final Destination series has always been credited for its elaborate death scenes and high octane begining which make the films so much fun. though each movie is pretty much the same, a whole bunch of people 'cheat death' and then they start to die but each movie has it's own zeist that you don't care if it feels like the same story. the first film is about Alex, who sees the plane he's supposed to go on explode and saves six other people, then they begin to die mysterious deaths until he realizes death is after them. the next film this time is about a car pile-up and Kimberly is the one who sees it. Claire Rivers from the first film shows up in the second. the third film is by far the best. this time its a rollercoster going of the tracks (in a dazzling display) and Wendy is the one who sees it. none of the original return in the third film but it's still great. it also has, in my opinion, the best death scenes out of the three. so if you love horror movies, then the FD series is perfect for you.",1154649600,17,1015,4.157360406091371
2559560,5,B000FBHCAK,"Hi. I did see the third movie, and it was great. I mean, none of these 3 movies deserve to win an Oscar, but they're really fun and entrertaining, cool to see all alone or with your friends.

The first one is pretty good, you might have all seen it already. The second is like the same, but with some different characters.

The third one is for me the best of all three Final Destination movies. It's very intense and exciting, in the first 10 minutes you'll have already jumped about 5 times. It's not scary. It's not a movie that while you see it yyou're being petrifyied by suspense, no. But the reason that I think this movie tops them all are the way people die. I mean if you analize the way people die, almost all of those things oculd perfectly happen to you or me tomorrow...now I'm even scared when I'm going to ride a roller coaster! The deaths are not as illogical as the deaths in the other 2 movies, so that's why it's more exciting.

Honestly, I don't know what does the fourth disc includes, but the three movies are great, and I'm absolutely gonna buy this when it's released, and if you liked the movies, I say go ahead and get it. Anyway, it's cheaper to buy the thrill-ogy than the three movies separately, considering the third movie on DVD is about 25 bucks.",1153353600,2,1280,4.325
2559561,5,B000FBHCAK,"I haven't seen the third movie yet. I heard it's supposed to be about a roller coaster so I can't wait to see that one. As for the first two movies, they are just great and scary and will keep you thinking, but at the same time entertained. These movies usually start off about a person who dreams about a terrible accident. As he or she wakes, they are exactly in the position that they were in their dream. The person panics and tries to stop the accident from happening by saving the people. The people usually see the person as a crazy lunatic, because he or she is yelling around and crying for no reason. Well he or she was panicing for a reason, because shortly afterwards, the accident really does accure and the person saves about 10 people or so. Now this person with the dream may have saved the people, but he or she cheated death. That means terrible accidents will happen to the people who were saved and they will die one by one in a brutal way. They are on Death's List.

To understand more perfectly, I recommend that you watch these movies, and even though I've only seen the first two, I still think the third one will be fantastic. If you love horror movies, you definitely won't regret it!",1149984000,7,1210,4.353982300884955

2559569,5,B000FBHCAK,"I wasn't going to write a review of the Final Destination movies because they are so good I worried that my review may not be able to do them justice but when I discovered that the overall rating for this box set was just 3 and a half stars (a rediculously low rating) I decided that I'd better try.

The Final Destination movies are by far my favourite movies (horror or not) EVER and I hope the series gets the endless number of sequels that it deserves.

Final Destination: Alex has a horrible premontion that the airplane he and his classmates sre boarding for French trip is going to crash. He freaks out on the airplane and he and five other people (four students and a teacher) are forcible removed from the airplane. The airplane does crash exactly as seen in Alex's premonition and so it seems that the lucky friends have cheated death. All goes well for the next 39 days until the night after the funeral of the victims of the aircrash and one of the survivors dies in a freak accident.

At first it seems as though the accident was a suicide, but then the other survivors also start to die in bizzare accidents and Alex and his friends must figure out deaths design - and cheat it again - before the grim reaper takes their lives.

Final Destinations 2 involves a girl having a premontion of a major car pile-up on a highway and pulls her car across the road preventing the aciident. The rest of the story is similar to number one but it is gorier and has a higher body-count while still managing to maintain those wonderfully imaginitive deaths, or ""accidents"".

The last survivor of the flight 180 disaster from the first movie (i won't spoil it by saying who) is in a mental institution but agrees to help the survivors of the car pile-up defeat death once and for all.

Final Destination 3: This time the premontition is of a rollercoaster disaster. Yes, the basic storyline is the same in all 3 movies but not enough for them to get boring. In this movie there is a great ammount of suspence as we do not know who is going to die next and this movie is a lot scarier than the prequels as well as gorier.

The deaths in the movies are scary and very suspenceful (and sometimes deliver shocks that make you gasp out loud). The storyline does not get boring and, in fact, (because of new twists, etc in each movie) improves with each addition to the series. This is absolutley the best series of movie ever. The movies are better than I make them sound but I'm not a skilled enough reviewer to do them justice.

I would recomend this series (or any of the individual movies) to anybody and if you've read this review and have still not decided whether or not to buy/watch than please at least buy or rent the first Final Destination and give it a chance. I guarantee you will not regret it if you do.",1237420800,12,2813,4.385796545105566
2559570,5,B000FBHCAK,"These are the three Final Destination movies, including the ""choose your fate"" 2 disc version of the third movie.  Nothing here that you couldn't get buying them seperately besides the case.  GREAT movies.  Lots of chain reactions leading to inventive and surprising deaths.  Of the three movies, the best death is still the quickest: the bus.",1232409600,5,343,5.071428571428571

8120220,5,B000FBHCAK,"this is a awesome movie. the deaths get better in this action horror thrill ride. the story is the same but the main death in this is at a race track. i just realized something by watching these movies. is that the first major accident is something that can truely happen in real life. that is the only scary thing about this movie but the others deaths are just for kicks. the story is good, the acting is good and the special effects are great. i do have one question why call it the final destination when they made a fifth movie. if you are going to make more don't call it the final destination. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do",1477440000,,656,4.173228346456693

8120225,5,B000FBHCAK,"Let me just say that these first three Final Destination movies are the baddest muthas out there! But this Canadian import box set is even sweeter. All three movies in Hi-Def. Can't beat it. Sure you get French writing on FD2 an FD3 but it's not overpowering. The first one is the only one with any features. Once you pop in part 2 and part 3 it takes you right to the movie. Sometimes this set is on sale for around 20 bucks. If you only dig the first three movies alone than this is the set to get. If you want all five (gazillion) than wait for a more complete box set. BTW, don't try and cheat death!",1339200000,,604,4.084033613445378
8120226,4,B000FBHCAK,"I'll review the first two as one entity, since they are closely related enough to be a single movie.

The story itself is something which I have not seen much of outside of this series, which is a plus. The rules set forth for death's design and beating that design are followed pretty well. The different ""accidents"" are for the most part well thought out, original and, in some cases, even funny. Intentional or not, there are a few scenes that I find very humorous, and I like to laugh so that's a plus. There's not much in the way of surprises, or even  plot, but what's given is certainly entertaining. Add the fact that Ali Larter (my second favorite actress) is a pivotal character in the first and given a decent chunk of time in the second, and they both are movies I almost never object to watching.

The third movie is where it falls apart. It's as if someone liked the idea of death having a design, threw in a few references to the past movies, and slapped the name Final Destination 3, onto the cover. It's a watchable movie in and of itself, something to pass the time with on a rainy day when you've watched all your other movies. However, it doesn't really add anything to the mythos of the original other than a concept involving (SPOILER) pictures showing how people die. (END OF SPOILER)
This seems like an interesting idea, but in practice feels out of keeping with the previous entries. There are some entertaining deaths, although with the exception of one or two they don't feel very original. It does have it's redeeming moments, such as a few funny conversations and good gore, but those don't really do enough to raise it to the level of the other two. If I hadn't seen the first pair of movies I would give this movie a four instead of the three I give it now. If you can ignore the name Final Destination in the title, you could probably enjoy this movie. I couldn't do that this time around unfortunately and my viewing experience suffered a little.

I definitely say this Trilogy is worth purchasing, however try to get it as cheap as possible. The first two are good and the third decent, so I don't see many buyers being disappointed with their purchases.",1284768000,,2188,4.489949748743719
