8189817,4,B000P7V4RG,This DVD is excellent and worth the money but I had to give it 4 stars because the video quality could be better and the volume of the instructor needs improvement. However the workouts are easy to follow don't require lots of space and give you a great workout. I would be this again.,1493856000,,285,4.296296296296297
8189818,4,B000P7V4RG,"I purchased this a while ago and have only done it maybe once or twice a week, but it does help.  I wouldn't be able to do this every toning session because the routine would be too boring and I suggest not making the mistake I did which is to start off right away with a 10lb bar.. it gets too exhausting.

The second video sessions not with Sherry Catlin requires a smaller bar that I did not have so I couldn't do those right away.  I rather like the total 30 minute one the best.  It's worth a try!",1455753600,2,502,3.99
8189819,4,B000P7V4RG,"This is a really good, basic body sculpting!  No intricate moves so far (I've done the first 2 30 minute segments several times).  You don't have to feel like you need to be in tip-top shape before trying this either.  I've also experimented with using hand weights as opposed to the bar.  (I have an 18lb bar that is too much for some of the exercises!)  All in all, I really like it.",1435104000,5,385,4.219178082191781
8189820,5,B000P7V4RG,This is a great workout. I really like how the instructional part is separate from the actual workouts.,1433203200,2,103,4.777777777777778
8189821,5,B000P7V4RG,Quick shipping product was as described,1422316800,,39,5.666666666666667
8189822,4,B000P7V4RG,"Good beginner, easy to follow. Cons: can't get from one section of the dvd back to the main menu. If want to switch to a different set of exercises have to eject and reload it to get to main menu and then select a different exercise routine. Tried it on my computer and dvd player and both same in difficulty to get to main menu.  Also if you advance past beginner easy 30 minutes, you have to pick working on abs or lower body specific workouts. There is not a more difficult full body routine besides the easy first session.  I'm a beginner so works for me for now. Will end up buying a different dvd for more advanced full body workout.  Each of the chapters on this is very detailed and well done. Worth the price even though some cons to it.",1422144000,8,746,4.2027972027972025
8189823,4,B000P7V4RG,"This DVD is  good basic training video, especially for person who has not done work with the body bar before.  One can easily adapt most, if not all of these exercises/routine to work with dumbbells and also exercise bands. The music is really more in the background so that the instructors directions are clear",1420243200,3,311,4.7407407407407405
8189824,5,B000P7V4RG,"I used to take a body bar class, and this dvd is just as good as the class. love the shorter session, I can do one or two at a time, it's great! Great for a beginner, but also great for someone like me with a some experince using the body bar.",1309219200,30,243,3.6923076923076925
