7821296,3,6302126207,This was actually a pretty decent movie.  It had some really funny spots especially where Beltran's and De Young's characters were at odds.  This is the first time I've seen De Young in anything and I thought his character was likable and amusing.  The plot is clear for the most part but it's the character interaction that makes it a fun watch.  Robert Beltran is charming in this and looks handsome as ever!!,1317772800,,411,4.589041095890411
7821297,3,6302126207,"This movie is drasticly overpriced, but if you can find it in a video rental place, rent it. To be honest, I was surprised. I am a big  De Young fan, and rented this because of it. I think this to be his second best  role. Robert Beltran did well also.",945561600,4,252,3.9215686274509802
