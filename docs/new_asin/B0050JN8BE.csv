4514620,5,B0050JN8BE,"I was at this show in Sept '82 and I thought it was the last time I would be seeing the band. Fortunatly, it was not. I have this show on VHS, which was copied from a Laser Disc, not a very good copy, to say the least. I can't wait to get this DVD. If you're a fan of the Brothers, buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed.",1309824000,9,325,3.657142857142857
4514621,5,B0050JN8BE,the production of this dvd is excellent.well filmed. i'm amazed at the video quality. the doobie brothers have been an icon in the music industry for many years and to this day they are still rockin' down the highway and playing high quality music. great addition to my dvd concert collection. well worth the money............,1309651200,3,326,4.945454545454545
4514622,4,B0050JN8BE,"Just ordered. Discovered by accident. Been a fan of the Doobies for 40 years. Saw them live in 1971. And, sort of both eras, original Tommy Johnston era and Michael McDonald era. Two completely different vibes. The Live at Wolf Trap DVD is fantastic with very little Michael McDonald era, but a lot of old, good stuff. South City Midnight Lady fantastic on there. This will make a great companion DVD. Took a listen online and sounds great. Looks like DTS sound, and the picture looks OK from the after checking it out on the Eagle Rock website.",1309478400,2,545,4.571428571428571
4514623,3,B0050JN8BE,"This is the song listing for this DVD. It is the same Love At The Greek show (1976)that was released on Video,Laser Disc and CED.I believe there is no extra footage included.(It would have been Great if they would have included the full songs and the JLS medley).I would Love to see a DVD release of Neil's concert run at the Greek or Winter Garden circa 1971-1972!

4514624,3,B0050JN8BE,"This is likely a re-issue of the old Neil Diamond laserdisc called ""Love at the Greek"" filmed in 1976. It's a very good show shot on video, and the Greek Theater in Berkeley is a really great outdoor setting. I much prefer, however, his ""Thank You Australia"" show filmed earlier the same year, available on DVD as well. Neil is just much more schmaltzy here, and the Australia one is simply a better performance. Not sure yet if this DVD will contain more footage, but the version I have begins with Neil explaining some of his background and how he loves to feed off the connection he builds with a live audience. The song listing is (not sure if the order is correct):

1. Beautiful Noise/Street Life/Lady Oh/If You Know What I Mean
2. Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show
3. Cherry Cherry
4. Cracklin' Rosie
5. Holly Holy
6. I Am...I Said
7. I've Been This Way Before
8. Play Me
9. Song Sung Blue
10. Sweet Caroline

""Song Sung Blue"" is quite extended, with audience sing-alongs, etc. A truly cultural moment arrives when Neil pulls Henry Winkler (at the peak of popularity) out of the audience to sing several verses with him. Neil tells him do it as the Fonz, and Winkler obliges! Very funny. There are several other celebrities seen, but I can't remember. Something tells me he tries to goad Carly Simon to sing a verse, but she doesn't want to. I'll have to check that out again. I'm also pretty sure he reprises ""Brother Love"" towards the end of the show.",1274400000,5,1466,4.528301886792453

It is great video and audio, with the disclaimer that rock concerts are dominated by very overpowering instrumentation, drowning out vocals to some degree. This one is not  too bad, ok.

4514776,2,B0050JN8BE,"As a huge fan of Neil Diamond, I was quite disappointed with this excerpt from one of his live concerts for several reasons.

FIRST, IT IS NOT THE COMPLETE SHOW.
This release appears to be excerpted from the same concert as the ""Love at the Greek"" show recorded at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles in 1976 when Diamond was in his prime. A portion of the show was originally issued as a 2-LP set with 17 songs. But when it was reissued on CD some years later, two songs _ ""Longfellow Serenade"" and ""The Last Picasso"" _ were cut so that it could be released on a single disc. There also apparently was a TV special produced from the show which was later issued on VHS tape and laser disc with a partially different lineup of 12 songs. This ""Live at the Greek Theatre 1976"" CD appears to be the same program as the VHS/laser disc, minus one song.

SECOND, THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT VERY GOOD.
Although there are four songs on this CD which were not on the 2-LP or single CD releases of ""Love at the Greek,"" the sound is far from great, which is ridiculous given the current CD technology. In fact, it sounds like it was dubbed from an old VHS copy of the show. It certainly is not digitally remastered. For those who are interested, the four songs from the show that are unique to this CD are ""Cherry, Cherry,"" ""Play Me,"" ""Cracklin' Rosie,"" and ""I Am...I Said.""

THIRD, ONE BIT OF EDITING IS TERRIBLE.
The other seven songs on this release were all on both versions of the ""Love at the Greek"" release. One song, however _ ""Lady Oh"" _ is cut off in a very poor fashion in the middle and the CD quickly goes into the next song, ""If You Know What I Mean."" This probably was done for the TV special, but it is really jarring on a CD. On the original LPs and CD of ""Love at the Greek,"" both songs are complete.

FOURTH, THERE IS A QUESTION OF LEGITIMACY.
The packaging of ""Live at the Greek Theatre 1976"" is much better than that of a typical bootleg, so I'm not sure if it is a legitimate release or not. But two things are certain: It was issued in the European Union and not put out by Columbia/Sony, the record label for which Diamond recorded for many years.

In summary, perhaps one day Columbia/Sony finally will realize that they should issue a deluxe, digitally remastered, two-CD complete version of this show the way MCA did for Diamond's original ""Hot August Night"" concert from 1972. If they include ""Longfellow Serenade,"" ""The Last Picasso,"" ""Cherry, Cherry,"" ""Play Me,"" ""Cracklin' Rosie,"" and ""I Am...I Said,"" such a complete release would have a MINIMUM of 21 songs. Considering Diamond concerts are virtually all more than two hours, there should be even more songs from the show languishing in the vaults.

Such a deluxe package could also include a DVD of the whole concert with 5.1 sound. Since there was a VHS/laser disc, I'm sure the video footage is locked away somewhere. If Columbia/Sony did such a release from when ND was at the top of his game, I believe they would make a whole lot of fans happy. I just hope this ""Live at the Greek Theatre 1976"" release does not preclude such a release from happening.

In any case, this CD is only worth buying if you are big enough ND fan to overlook the sound imperfections and the fact it isn't the complete show.",1419120000,,3272,4.4072847682119205

The overall effect is quite fun.  The late Cornelius Bumpers is on tenor sax and organ and sadly passed away a few years ago.  I met him once and liked him.,1417219200,,321,4.3

4514792,3,B0050JN8BE,"Pretty ok, worth the money, not their best.  This is the Doobie Brothers as far as I can tell just before Michael McDonald leaves the group.  The players are good but they seem to be individual wannabe rockstars trying to establish an identity for when he leaves.  His keys are well down in the mix.  Apparently half of these guys were new to the group and trying to fill big shoes.  They sound like good musicians playing together on the songs Michael McDonald leads and when the old lead singer comes back as a special guest with some of the older members at the end.  I'm guessing or rather whoever had his guitar turned up too loud on Michael Mconald's songs is ashamed now.  It was amazing to see how the same band sounded like completely different groups depending on who was leading the song.  At one point the rest of the band is hyping the crowd and its just MM and the organ/sax player.  That interlude is glorius and glaring.  If you are a Doobie Brother's fan, buy this its still pretty good.  Or you can call me and I'll lend it to you.",1416873600,,1049,4.328205128205128

4514799,3,B0050JN8BE,"I've only seen the Doobies in Syracuse, NY in 1975 and locally just last month.  I'm not a Michael McDonald fan and was glad he wasn't at these concerts.  In fact, he had his own concert at another local place at the same time the Doobies were at a different local place.  Their music has always been great for me.  I mean all of their music and not just their hits.  The subject matter of this DVD is great but there were technical issues.  When they created this DVD from the original concert, they should've re-edited the 5 bonus songs back into the first part of the original concert footage where it was edited out from.  Then the concert would be seen in it's entirety.  There was no reason to insert part of the end credits during the last part of the last song of the concert.  They could've run the end credits at the very end against a black screen or concert stills.  I noticed a volume change twice near the first part of the concert.  The 5 bonus songs that were edited out were probably from that spot.  I had a sound drop-out 57.23 minutes into the DVD.  I think this was technical because the DVD player's timer was steady and the video stayed steady.  There were at least 2 cameras that had problems with assorted lines from the top center to right of the lenses, and the lines would keep on changing designs.  The DVD creators should plan better and use more quality control.",1406505600,,1393,4.365758754863813

4514831,5,B0050JN8BE,"Honestly, I always thought the original ""Farewell"" concert film of the Doobs, the final show of the '82 tour, was filmed in Oakland, what with both Tom and Keith sporting A's jerseys. So I was under the impression that this was a different show than the original ""Farewell"" concert film, of which I've had a pretty good quality copy of for years.
  Upon putting this DVD on, I quickly realized it was, in fact, the same ""Farewell"" concert film I already owned, which I first saw on PBS in the late 80's. However, whatever disappointment I might have had that it wasn't an entirely different gig was quickly superceded by the noticeable quality upgrade in both sound and video. If you need the most modern production, then look elsewhere, like maybe that Live At Wolf Trap DVD. Likewise, if you prefer the harder-edged Tom Johnston lead version of the band, again, go with Wolf Trap. But if you want a serious upgrade of your VHS or laser disc transferred copy of this great show, as Michael McDonald influenced as they would ever be, then pick this baby up immdediately!
  The band sounds great here. Whatever zest they may have lost by this point in general is more than recouped by the emotion of this being the ""final"" show. I used to think this show was merely good or very good, but as I stated in the heading, the quality upgrade is so noticeable that I now have to say it's great. It's simply that much better a viewing experience.
  I enjoy all of the Doobie lineup configurations. What versatility these guys showed moving from bluesy rock into a soulful jazz rock and finally the jazz infused pop/rock they ended up playing by this show. Make no mistake though, this show is as Michael McDonald driven as they would ever be, and the older rock hits are not as rocking as they originally were. I personally like it this way. For example, multi-instrumentalist Cornelius Bumpus sings the opening track ""Listen To The Music"". I'm a major rock video collector, and I already have at least 3 versions of Tom singing it, so to me it's a nice change of pace. Also, it shows off the band's sheer talent and confidence being willing to allow a fairly new member take the reins of a number one song. This might not be for everyone, but you have to keep in mind that by this point Mike had been the driving writing force in the band (1976-82) as long as Tom had been earlier (1970-76).
Tom appears for one song at the end, and this is a landmark video of the band, so even if you prefer the earlier Doobs, for the money this show's a must! Plus, there's 5 bonus songs cut from the original film, making this purchase a no brainer at around $10. All 5 tunes are Mike era songs, however, just so you know. Man, they sound great! My one wish would have been for a menu option to view the show with the 5 extra songs reinserted so as to watch the concert complete as it originally was. Instead, you can only watch them separately, but at least there is a ""play all"" option to watch all 5 bonus tunes straight through. One can only hope for more remastered DVD releases from the band's pro-shot archive, namely their Soundstage appearance in 1977, my favorite, and their daytime outdoor show Live At Santa Barbara from 1981 with the same lineup as this Greek Theater show.

I was fortunate to catch the Doobie Brothers live in 1975 or 1976. I'm not really sure. I caught them with a friend of mine, Daniel Timothy Moore, who passed away a few years back.
The Doobies had just added Michael McDonald to the mix and released one of their best albums Takin' It to the Streets, which launched two singles ""Wheels of Fortune""'and the title cut.
I was especially impressed with the stage presence of Tom Johnston, who sang lead on ""Wheels"" and Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter who was ablaze with energy.
The Doobie Brothers got their name from, not a band member, but a housemate Keith ""Dyno"" Rosen. The guys originally called the band Pud. Johnson would say later they got the name ""because Dyno had a fondness for `doobies' (slang for marijuana cigarettes).""
My friends at Eagle Rock recently released Doobie Brothers: ""Live at the Greek Theatre 1982"" on DVD and on a two-CD set.
The two hour DVD'has all their greatest hits including ""Rokin' Down the Highway,""'""Long Train Runnin,'"" ""Black Water,""'""Minute by Minute,"" ""China Gove"" and many more.  Even my personal favorites turn up -- ""Jesus Is Just Alright,"" ""Out On the Streets"" and ""Listen To the Music.""
This would not be just the final tour, but final show of the tour so you can feel the hometown heroes feed off the audience and visa versa.
Of course, if you're a true fan you know the Doobies are still rockin' with two of the original members, Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons and have a new CD out, World Gone Crazy.",1315785600,9,1540,4.658088235294118

The crowd is really into this one. It was suppose to be their Farwell Concert, and it was for a while, but thankfully they re-united around 5 years later. They are still performing today, however, Michael McDonald is not in the current version of the Doobie Brothers, but he is in this ""Farwell Concert"". This particular version of the Doobies, and the re-united versions are all relatively large bands. You get 3 drummers, 2-3 guitar players, a bass guitar player, 2 keyboard players, a saxaphone player, a fiddle player, and multiple lead singers. This band is ""Packed"" full of talent, especially this version on this concert dvd. It was great to see this relatively early version of the Doobies performing together again, after all these years.

4514878,4,B0050JN8BE,"Judge Victor Valdivia, DVD Verdict-- There's probably no more terminally unhip classic rock band than The Doobie Brothers. Lacking the bad-boy glamour of the Rolling Stones, the mystique of Led Zeppelin, the devoted following of the Grateful Dead, or the sheer popularity of the Eagles, the Doobie Brothers have always been dismissed as musical lightweights despite their undeniable popularity. In some ways, however, that very lack of pretense is what makes the band's best songs still enjoyable even decades later. The Doobie Brothers: Live at the Greek Theatre is a TV special filmed at the last performance of the band's 1982 ""farewell"" tour (though they would reform some years later) and it demonstrates that the Doobies' most enduring music, especially the songs recorded later in the band's career, remains worthy of respect. The concert was filmed at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California, on September 11, 1982.

What the concert makes clear is just how much the band changed when singer Michael McDonald joined. When the Doobie Brothers began recording in the early '70s under the direction of original singer/songwriter Tom Johnston, they were a pleasant guitar-boogie band, as heard in hits like ""Listen to the Music"" and ""Black Water."" Johnston left in 1976, however, and was replaced by McDonald, who changed the band's sound to reflect his affection for jazz and R&B. McDonald expanded the Doobies' audience substantially with hits like ""Minute By Minute,"" ""Takin' It to the Streets,"" and ""What a Fool Believes,"" the latter of which scored the band a Grammy Award and was a multiplatinum smash. The band plays both sides of their music with equal skill but the difference is clearly evident in the audience's response. When the Doobies play their earlier songs and even when Johnston returns to join for a closing jam on ""Listen to the Music,"" the audience is pleased. When the band launches into their McDonald-era material, however, the audience erupts into cheers and applause. The early songs are agreeable but it's really the McDonald material that defines what most people think of when they think of the Doobie Brothers. They may not be as groundbreaking or influential as those of their peers, but McDonald's songs remain infectious, well-crafted slices of pop craft that are undeniable. The band's performance is solid (the Doobies were always a consistent, if hardly overwhelming, live act) so the concert delivers the band's most notable songs in entertaining versions that do them justice. It makes for a fine way to enjoy the Doobie Brothers' music.

Technically, the disc is typically first-rate, as is the case with most Eagle Rock releases. The full-screen transfer looks surprisingly sharp and crisp, especially for a concert shot on video in the early '80s. It doesn't suffer from the fading and softness that plagues most videos from the era. The surround mixes are also superb, crisp and clear with good separation of each instrument. There are a couple of spots where they sound a bit tinny, but for the most part these are good mixes. The extras consist of five songs left off the original TV broadcast of the concert.

The only reason I was interested in this show was the return of Tom Johnston to the Doobie lineup, and he doesn't disappoint - although he sings only one of his signature songs with the band.
I can only add, here, that his permanent return to the band (in 1987) marked one of the happiest days of my life.
This DVD will really please Michael McDonald fans.  It marks the end of his ""top dog"" status with the band.  He plays once in awhile with the band these days, but the original incarnation of the band can't be beat in my opinin.",1310083200,27,704,4.285714285714286

The editing let the show down a little bit, but it is a nice piece of memorabilia to have. Pity we can't get ""Hot August Night"" on DVD. That would be something to see.",1521590400,,309,4.0
