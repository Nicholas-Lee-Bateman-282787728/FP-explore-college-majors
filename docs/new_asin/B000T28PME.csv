8207291,4,B000T28PME,"I enjoyed this very much.  The author obviously did not interview Tom Hanks, but he interviewed many people who knew him at various points in his life AND quoted Hanks'  words from many, many interviews.  It felt like a balanced biography, and I found it very interesting.",1312243200,,272,4.74468085106383

8207293,3,B000T28PME,"Like many a ""Biography"" episode, this is gushy.  Tom Hanks is interviewed for the work and perhaps he insisted on that.  They never mentioned that he came off like a sore loser when Russell Crowe's film beat ""Castaway.""  It says nothing about how his wife's pilot ""My Big Fat Greek Life"" never soared.  It says nothing on how he has been filmed barely clothed but never nude, unlike most famous actors.

I think ""Luckiest"" in the title speaks to both Tom's talent and to his being at the right place at the right time.  The work does a good job in showing how almost everything he touches turns to gold.  Maybe my ears were closed for a second, but the work didn't seem to mention ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and Tony Kushner once said moviegoers preferred that film over ""Philadelphia.""  Tom's high school drama teacher is interviewed.  He doesn't say anything about an important aspect of his identity, yet Tom brought it up when accepting the award for ""Philadelphia"" and the fact was spun into the film ""In & Out.""

Though my copy of the disc said 2007, this work said nothing of Tom's performance in ""The Da Vinci Code.""  Tom's partner in ""Bosom Buddies,"" Peter Scolari, is interviewed a lot here and he doesn't appear to be jealous about how Tom has skyrocketed unlike himself.  I wonder if the actor who played Ted has no hard feelings against Keanu Reeves either.  (Why am I channeling that Simpsons episode where Lisa meets a girl smarter than her now?)

This work is really for Hanks' hardcore fans or for folk who want to know how the famous became famous.  I admire Hanks a lot, but those who don't care for him won't like all the praise that is spilled upon him here.",1193961600,6,1675,4.536666666666667
