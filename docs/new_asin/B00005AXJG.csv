8324679,5,B00005AXJG,"Dear Amazon.com:
I am writing this as a testimonial for the video ""Me, My ADD Coach and I.""  I  have found this video to be extremely informative in helping me to -- not  only make the decision to get a coach for ADD -- but to train as a  specialized ADD coach as well.
I've since been recommending this video to my ADD clients, with great  results.  They have found it interesting, amusing, explanatory about their  issues.  As a practicing ADD coach, I find the video a great tool in  introducing prospective clients to coaching and easing their understanding  about the nature of their disorder.
I hope you do all you can to promote this unique video.  There is nothing  else like it today for ADD adults.
Sincerely, Bonnie Mincu...",996019200,3,735,4.569230769230769

A.D.D. Coaching promotes knowledge about A.D.D., sensitivity, empathy, honesty and acceptance, but more importantly, it is a safe place to gain insight. It's about bringing balance & passion back into your life.  This video is interesting, fun and most importantly, thorough. I frequently share this wonderful video with my new clients as well as parents of children diagnosed with ADD.
Coaching provides you with a chance to experience a shift in your thoughts, feelings and actions in a safe place.  Friends can be a wonderful support through some of life's difficulties.  But only a dedicated coach can care and remain objective while guiding you forward to a Life...Worth Living!
Thanks, David, for creating this video!!!

8324682,5,B00005AXJG,"I'm a student of David Giwerc and the ADD Coach Academy as well as an ADD Coach and Advocate and have three copies of this video to lend out to clients, professionals and schools.  I've found it a tremendous resource to explain what ADD coaching can do for an ""ADDer"" and their loved ones.  It's also a very understandable, ""user friendly"" resource on ADD and how it affects ""ADDers"" and their relationships.  The video interviews real people who are or have been ADD Coaching clients of Dave Giwerc's as well as ADD professionals Dave works with and respects.  I think the best points made, however, are the real life SUCCESS stories in this video, ""ADDers"" who once properly diagnosed, got help and through a multi-modal approach (a team behind them consisting of a coach, psychiatrist, psychologist, family, friends, school, employers) learned how to manage their ADD rather than be managed by it.
Dave Giwerc is one of the best resources out there on ADD and ADD Coaching bringing to others his own personal struggles and successes as well as his extensive, comprehensive and empathetic knowledge of ADD.  Dave has done a wonderful job creating this resource for others to understand not only the impact that ADD has on the lives of ""ADDers"" but better yet, the impact that an ""ADDer"" can make and have on his/her own life once diagnosed and coached toward their tremendous potential.  It's an educational, positive and hopeful video.  I recommend it to all professionals as well as ""ADDers"" and their loved ones.",994377600,3,1517,4.879377431906615
8324683,5,B00005AXJG,"Have you ever felt ""broken"" in spite of your successes?  Are you an overachiever?  Underachiever?  Do you ever wonder why things seem harder for you than they are for others?  Year after year, these monumental concerns adversely affect thousands of individuals. Not one of us who has grown up this way, ever dreamed that the reason for all of this ""baggage"" may be caused by a neurological disorder.  By watching this expertly designed and performed video, you may begin to understand how to turn around your life in spite of the ordinary, yet often overwhelming struggles we face.  Do you have more creative ideas than you have the ability and/or time to develop?  Are you a ""paralyzing perfectionist"" who ruins the quality of life not only for yourself, but also for your loved ones and everyone else?  Are you a chronic procrastinator, no matter if you ""pull it off"" or not?  Again, the pathway toward improving the quality of your life may begin with the straightforward facts presented in this video.  If your child has ADD/ADHD (the most under-diagnosed disorder in the physician's DSM IV when it's correctly given), and you want help in coaching him in a supportive fashion, this creative video is the place to start.  Do you tend toward alcoholism?  Or any other kind of addiction?  Are you, at times, suicidal?  Are you one of the 17-20 million Americans with ADD/ADHD, now a proven genetic disorder? At last, begin the best recovery program by watching this unparalleled video.  Are you one of those who mistakenly believe that the pharmaceutical companies are pulling off the biggest hoax of all times?  The U. S. Supreme Court Judges recently denied the existence of such a thing.  Are you one of those who think that humans can single-handedly compensate for neurological disorders?  GET THIS VIDEO and learn all you can as we continue our journey through the ""last frontier"", the Human Brain.",992044800,,1906,4.8847352024922115

Me, my ADD Coach & I beautifully decribes the role of the ADD Coach in this process.  It provides a thorough and accurate guide to this aspect of care of this chronic condition.

8324685,5,B00005AXJG,"From the beginning to the end of this easy-to-watch tape, I was engrossed. The catchy, rhythmic background music was a big part of the enjoyment I experienced in watching this. I realized I was learning an incredible amount as well. The range of players involved in this drama included ADD Coaches, doctors, clients. The spacing of this film was in easy-to-chew chunks. Perfect for ADD. I think it is geared more toward the ADD/ADHD adult. There is as not as much out there for the ADD/ADHD adult as for children, but this tape could easily be watched by younger folks.  I think the vision demonstrated by this piece of work is remarkable. The insight and the messages are obviously from skilled and caring professionals, with candor and humanity. I recommend this tape highly to anyone either curious about ADD/ADHD coaching, the symptoms, or possibilities of how to cope with challenges and meet them with success. I think anyone in service professions would benefit from watching this to gain insight into  patients, clients, family, or colleagues with Attentional challenges.",988502400,5,1079,5.056179775280899
8324686,5,B00005AXJG,"This video on adult ADHD is excellent for a number of reasons.  The viewer receives an accurate explanation of the characteristics and impact of ADHD. Adults with ADHD speak candidly about their life experiences.  Those who coach people with ADHD explain what role they play and how their expertise can help their clients.  One key point that is made is that knowledge of the condition and understanding of the person with ADHD is central to coaching him or her. I have also found the video useful for older teens who are in a postion to prevent some of the frustrations and disappointments that adults have experienced.  There is so much more information on this video than I have mentioned. I have watched it several times, and on each viewing, I have learned something new.",988070400,4,776,4.768656716417911
