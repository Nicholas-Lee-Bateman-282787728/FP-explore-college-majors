It does broke down the soloing of the song ""rock this town"",  but thats all. Steve does an aswesome job in the brake down, but in the end I was disappointed. The title should be called The Soloing Breakdown of the Stray Cats ""Rock This Town""...  Now I'm sure someone will get alot out of this video and thats cool, but again be forewarned it is what it is..",1389744000,,488,4.236559139784946
