8308201,5,B001H9MLFK,"The technical ideas surrounding the ""underground"" book sensation - Daemon - are explored in this presentation by author Daniel Suarez.

Originally self-published under the pseudonym Leinad Zeraus, the book is slated for hardcover release in January 2009. In this DVD, Suarez delves into the cyber-world of bots, daemons and other incredible marvels - that can be used for good....and evil - from the book and the planned 2010 follow-up, Freedom.

The concepts are presented in a way to hold the interest of the uninitiated, while containing enough gems to make it an intriguing view for those with a better understanding of the material. This is the reality of a thriller that actually happens each time we turn on virtually every device that makes our personal and professional universe incredibly smaller each moment of every day.",1230336000,,832,5.155555555555556
8308202,5,B001H9MLFK,"If you are interested in more depth about ideas which inspired Daemon, this is a nice presentation describing what bots are, what they do, where they are now, and what they may do in the future.  Various other authors and concepts are presented, which sent me packing to Amazon to order more books.  Several interesting aspects of personal privacy regarding ways our personal data is collected and sold are presented.  Interesting discussion of how many existing techs can be integrated to create new systems, a la Daemon.  Also how this could benefit society if organized as he presents. If you haven't read the book, start there (I've read it 4 times so far). If you are interested is seeing where bot technology is now, and may head toward, this is worth a look.",1229040000,4,765,4.7293233082706765
