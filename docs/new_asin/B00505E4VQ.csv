Yes, the picture is not so great, it looks like that the production company just copied the VHS on to disc, no digital transfer whatsoever, but is still watchable! I sat through the whole concert just fine enjoying the show. Yes, the concert is in 4:3 and not in the widescreen format that us Kylie fans are so used to with all Kylie's other concert DVD's, but remember that this concert was in 1991 when everything was still in 4:3 on VHS. Who cares, anyone with widescreen tv's can adjust the picture to 4:3 like me, that's not a problem at all with me. And the last downside to this DVD is, yes, that there are no special features whatsoever like the VHS and Laserdisc originally had. Obviously, the picture quality is not so great to begin with, so apparently when this was put on DVD, it was transfered in a 1 hour recording format and not 2 hours to keep the picture quality from getting worse, that explains the editing portion to shorten the concert to 1hr and 5min, thus no special features. Doesn't bother me there's no special features. So there you have it, you decide for yourself. As for me, none of this bothers me. Being a Kylie fan since 1987, this is a true gem for me. I live in the US, so the only available Kylie DVD's here in the states are Kylie's Parlophone, EMI era (2000-Present). Anything prior to that is not available for US market. I still long await Kylie's ""Intimate And Live"" DVD to be available here, but still to no avail. So yes, I was excited when this concert made its US debut. This is true Kylie nostalgia...before the bigger productions, before the bigger budgets, and before Kylie's Deconstruction and Parlophone Record era. This was when Kylie was still with PWL Records!!! The Record label that started it all!!! Thus, this is the only concert DVD available for US fans to see Kylie perform just Kylie's PWL hits. Ok, yes there was the ""On The Go: Live In Japan"", but that wasn't actually a live concert performance like this one is, but still good to own and watch, and Kylie only had 2 albums out at that time so not a long show. I love Kylie's old work just as much as I love Kylie's current work, so this is truly a must have for any Kylie collection!!! So my 5 star rating is for having this on DVD, available for US market, and having an hours worth of classic Kylie!!! By the way, this DVD is in DTS surround so I was a bit surprised. It is also in 5.1 and 2.0 as an option.",1335744000,2,2595,4.297959183673469
8450731,1,B00505E4VQ,"I was very excited when I heard this had finally gotten a legitimate DVD release.  My excitement quickly turned to disgust, however, once I actually viewed the disc.  First off, the picture quality is atrocious, worse than a VHS tape.  Even worse, though, is that the picture has been artificially stretched from its original 4:3 aspect ratio in order to fill a 16:9 screen.  This means Kylie & Co. end up looking short and fat!  I was able to compensate somewhat by playing with the settings on my player, but it still ended up cutting off a significant portion of the top and bottom of the picture.  The final nail in the coffin is that the behind-the-scenes vignettes that were part of the videotape and laserdisc releases have been inexplicably edited out, leaving only the actual stage show.

Not that it matters much, but the sound quality is pretty good -- but not good enough to recommend throwing your money away on this release.  If you have one of the original videotape or laserdisc copies, hold on to it, because it's still better than this DVD.",1312588800,8,1058,4.650537634408602
