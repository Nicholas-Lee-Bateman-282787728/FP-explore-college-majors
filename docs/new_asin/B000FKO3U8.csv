2570040,5,B000FKO3U8,"Fox has not publicized the bonus features on this long awaited collections so, for the benefit of those who are curious, here's what is included in this collection:

1.  featurettes on Peter Lorre, Director Norman Foster, Producer Sol Wurtzal, and Lorre's personal stuntman Harvey Parry. The same crew that did the excellent featurettes on the Chan collection did these as well.

2. Trailers for two of the films

3.  a clip of the Ritz Brothers doing a skit while impersonating Lorre, Karloff, and Laughton (attached to the end of one of the featurettes)

4.  Restoration comparison (the prints used for the DVDsare said to look excellent)

Fox has followed up their great Chan box with the even more rare Moto series.  Hopefully Moto Vol 2 will be out before the end of the year.

Highly recommended.",1153958400,100,802,4.830882352941177

These may not be quite as famous as Charlie Chan but they are just as watchable.  This was a different era in Hollywood.

They are not, however, the first four movies in the Mr. Moto series, but the box-set does include two of the best in the series.  These are the films:  ""Think Fast, Mr. Moto"", ""Thank You, Mr. Moto"", ""Mr. Moto Takes a Chance"", and ""Mysterious Mr. Moto"".

2570043,5,B000FKO3U8,"At long last, the people at Fox video are opening the vaults to release the classic Mr. Moto films starring the great Peter Lorre.  If Fox is releasing the films in order, the films in the set should be THINK FAST, MR. MOTO (1937), THANK YOU, MR. MOTO (1938), MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE (1938), and MR. MOTO TAKES A CHANCE (1938).  Since none of the Moto films have ever been offically released (with the exception of 1939's MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING, for some reason in the public domain), this deluxe DVD debut of the Japanese detective/adventurer is a cause for celebration.  Hopefully, Fox will show as much care with this set (and as much care with the set of four Charlie Chan films that are also finally coming out from cold storage) as they did with the recent release of their Laurel and Hardy films, with excellent commentaries, notes, and extras.  Please Fox, give us the rest of the Moto films soon!",1148601600,72,900,4.571428571428571

2570057,4,B000FKO3U8,"Having heard of these movies for many years and as a fan of Peter Lorre's, I was looking forward to finally seeing them, especially in a restored DVD format.

""Think Fast"" and ""Thank You"" did not disappoint, both having suitably atmospheric Asian settings along with Lorre's great characterization.

""Takes A Chance"" was a big letdown with an excess of spliced-in jungle nature footage, a wacky vaudevillian for unneeded comic relief, and huge plot holes ( Why was the Rajah's wife murdered?  Every pigeon, really?  How did he know she would find the hidden map?  How was she the only one to see through his disguise? )

""Mysterious"" was an improvement over ""Chance"", but in a London setting.  Still the London sets looked great.

My last complaint is that the pricing has remained close to 45, not far below the list of 50, for this 2006 set.  Especially with each of the four films barely over an hour in length, this pricing seems high for what are now just novelty films from the 1930's.  With a little searching, I was able to find the brand-new boxed collection for 25, shipping included.",1435449600,,1094,4.7105263157894735

2570109,4,B000FKO3U8,"This four-film set, the first of two volumes devoted to the Mr. Moto movies, is a delightful period anthology. Each film is rather short, just a bit over an hour, and is based on the character created by John Marquand to replace Charlie Chan in the pages of the Saturday Evening Post after Chan's creator, Earl Derr Biggers, passed away. In each story, Moto -- played by Peter Lorre -- displays his mastery of disguise and cunning to fulfill a mission, whether to foil smugglers or forestall a dangerous revolution. There are plot and character twists galore -- all of them fun if sometimes a bit predictable, once you get the hang of the formula. The depiction of Asians is stereotypical in many cases, but if you can put yourself into the 1930s and play along for the sake of the story, those biases don't grate too much. The qualities of these restorations is very good, and the set contains some nice extras: principally little biographical pieces about Lorre and others connected to the production of the films.

2570134,5,B000FKO3U8,"This is a great collection well rendered in digital, crisp and clean with ecellent sound.

Peter Lorre was well cast as Mr. Moto the clever and resorcefull agent of the international police.  he's a patient master of descise yet willing to take a risk.  In the fight he's fast and agile.  Unlike many of his contemporaries when fighting for his life, he actually kills the attacker; no accidents, falling on a knife tripping over a rail or getting hit by a train.  I find these gimmicks repulsively anti-climatic.  It's refreshing for the hero to take responsibility for doing what needs to be done.  Mr. Moto often uses the westerner's arrogant underestimation of Asians to get near suspects to spy on them.  It's only Mr. Moto they fear.

The stories are fast moving and exciting with variety of plot twists and turns. This was a case of, this is not an old movie, just one I've never seen before.  I really enjoyed them, (All 8, I have volume 2 as well).",1381190400,3,957,4.576470588235294

2570137,5,B000FKO3U8,"love the mr. motto serial movies. it is a genre that has passed and thought to be pass. But I relish watching these movies. great writing, great acting, great story lines.",1377129600,2,171,4.548387096774194
2570148,5,B000FKO3U8,"The Mr. Moto film series of the 1930s is historic in several ways:  Moto was the first Asian hero to use martial arts in a film, the first Asian hero to employ lethal violence as a matter of routine, and the only Japanese-American character to star in his own film series.  And even though we once again have a Caucasian man playing an Asian role, it's the most dignified portrayal of an Asian hero I've ever seen.  Peter Lorre's characterization is understated and refreshingly free of ""yellowface"" mannerisms.  It's been written that he hated playing Mr. Moto, but it certainly doesn't show.  Lorre inhabits the role seamlessly, and brings his own special nuances to it.

One of those nuances makes the Mr. Moto series historic in a most astounding way.  It took a while for me to realize it, but there can be no doubt: Peter Lorre plays Ken Moto as a GAY CHARACTER!  This nuance was evidently not present in the Marquand books, but it's definitely there on film.  Moto is effeminate, and ever so slightly flamboyant: He is seen sniffing flowers and doting on his cat.  His large eyes sometimes wink at another man flirtatiously.  He lounges about his rooms wearing red kimonos, which was early Hollywood code for a Gay character (but since Moto is Japanese, such florid attire doesn't arouse suspicion in this case).  Moto's interaction with women is strictly professional.  Lotus Long sometimes appears as his companion, but any hint of romance is merely pretense; she's merely a colleague helping him crack a case.

You'll notice that, during the course of a story, he and a good-looking male character will often be drawn to each other; they'll end up spending a lot of time together, although nothing erotic is explicitly shown.  These are post-Code films, after all.  However, homo-eroticism seethes just beneath the surface of Mr. Moto's slightly sinister manner, and it can manifest unexpectedly:  Check out the very tender death scene between Lorre and Philip Ahn in THANK YOU, MR. MOTO.  That excellent entry in the film series is part of this collection.

I'm not surprised that an actor from Germany, where the Gay Rights movement was born, would know how to style a Gay character in just the right way.  Lorre's low-key portrayal of a homosexual Japanese man is SUPERB, and spot-on for the times.  In fact, it would be equally refreshing if seen on screen today, and a much-needed antidote to the over-the-top Gay mannerisms that Hollywood is once again peddling.  But the main reason to buy the Mr. Moto films on DVD is to enjoy some damn good mystery, drama and action from the 1930s.  As a rule, these plots don't drag; things tend to move along at a brisk clip.  If you don't want to see any Gay nuances, they are easy to overlook.  But they are definitely there!  Every fan of Gay detective fiction should own a complete collection of Mr. Moto movies.",1376006400,,2871,4.761133603238866

Watched 2 movies one night, then the next 2 in the series the following night.  They were all very good.  Peter Lorre was a superb actor.  Had to check internet  right away to see if he did his own stunts.  Found out Harvey Parry was his double.  Realized later there was a special feature on one of the movies about Harvey Parry.  He wa known as the ""dean of hollywood"" and was one of the very first stuntmen.  Was a very interestiing  featurette.

2570157,4,B000FKO3U8,"Created by author John P. Marquand as a replacement for Charlie Chan in the pages of the Saturday Evening Post after the death of author Earl Derr Biggers, Mr. Moto's screen incarnations have suffered a similar fate to that of his honorable predecessor. Rarely revived on television because of worries over political correctness - though as with Chan, Moto is always way ahead of the white characters - and long consigned to poor quality public domain video and DVD releases, Fox's lovingly restored Region 1 NTSC boxed set finally allows a new generation the chance to see him in focus again. The first of two boxed sets covering the eight Peter Lorre films and the much-disliked one-off attempt to revive the series in 1965 with Henry Silva, the selection in each set is a bit strange - the films were not released in the order they were produced, but the first set follows neither production or release order - but they're an entertaining collection that makes a very interesting contrast to the Chan films.

From the evidence presented by Think Fast, Mr. Moto, it's surprising that the series caught on. It's not so surprising that, with Charlie Chan at the height of his popularity, there would be a market for another Oriental sleuth, in this case Pete Lorre's Japanese detective, or even that he should find a home at Chan's then-home studio, 20th Century Fox. It's because the film is so curiously constructed: for most of the movie you have no idea what Mr. Moto is actually doing. We know it involves disguises, some ju-jitsu - Moto is a much more violently proactive sleuth than Chan - bodies in wicker baskets, smuggling and White Russians in Shanghai, but it would really help if somewhere around the second reel someone told us just what he suspects the various shifty characters of doing instead of leaving the mystery itself a mystery for so long. Perhaps even odder than the narrative inscrutability is the way the film actually seems to be playing up to Lorre's sinister screen persona and almost presenting him as a villain, especially when he ends a fight with one suspect in a ship's cabin by throwing him overboard to certain death and calmly going about his business with only a small self-satisfied smile to hint that anything untoward had happened. The worst that Charlie Chan would do to the guilty party would be to come up with an aphorism while he was led quietly away by the police, but Moto gives the impression that he'd be happy to kill them to save time and trouble and when he suggests slitting an innocent witness's throat to Sig Ruman's villain, you get the impression he wouldn't be upset if he took him up on it.

But if it's a confusing affair, it's also a surprisingly lavish one: rather than the penury of Boris Karloff's Mr Wong films, Fox clearly spent a decent amount of money on the picture despite it not being one of their A-pictures and it's almost as entertaining as it is confusing. Along with the original trailer there's also a featurette on Peter Lorre's regular stunt double, legendary stuntman Harvey Parry, including a rare audio interview with him shortly before his death.

If the first film has its problems, the third to be produced but the second to be released remedies most of them with much more satisfying and entertaining results. Thank You, Mr. Moto also jumps in right at the deep end, with Moto disguised as a Mongolian on a caravan in the Gobi Desert, but doesn't take as long revealing what he's up to this time: trying to stop art treasures being smuggled out of China, in particular an incomplete set of scrolls that, when reunited, reveal the location of the tomb of Genghis Khan. Naturally there's a rogues' gallery of suspects after them as well, though Moto's moral compass is not much better aligned than theirs at times: although it occurs offscreen, he murders one suspect and cheerfully covers up the crime. Once again, there's plenty of action and a surprising level of violence - when the villain can't beat the information they want out of one character, they repeatedly punch his elderly mother in the face instead, making sure the sharp end of his ring makes contact each time. There's also a surprisingly powerful death scene after Moto doesn't get to the rescue in time, played with a surprising degree of realism.

The production values once again are very impressive for what wasn't intended as an A-list picture even if a couple of the cast of the previous entry, Thomas Beck and Sig Rumann, return in different roles, along with new suspects John Carradine (as a Portuguese dealer in antiquities, real and fake) and Sidney Blackmer. It also benefits from atmospheric and muscular direction from Norman Foster that even manages to draw out decent performances from often stilted players like Philip Ahn, who is remarkably convincing in his latter scenes. All in all it's a pretty terrific 77 minutes, the DVD also offering the original trailer and a featurette on producer Sol Wurtzel.

The second Moto film to be made but the fourth to be released - even though it's set in 1937, it wasn't released until 1938 - Mr. Moto Takes a Chance isn't nearly as strong as Thank You, Mr. Moto thanks to a bit too much comic relief and a fairly so-so plot involving revolting natives near Ankor Watt, Rochelle Hudson's downed aviatrix, a pair of newsreel cameramen and Edward J. Bromberg's comic rajah. As usual we find Moto already in situ, posing as an archaeologist but with the usual ulterior motive and disguises (in this case hobbled by some less than convincing old age makeup). The ruthlessness is still very much in place: where in later entries Moto became a little more concerned with saving the lives of the supporting characters, here he has no qualms about covering up evidence that will free two wrongly accused men or luring them into harm's way if it will serve his purposes. They may ultimately be benign, but his methods are often callously expedient: it's not just his looks that cause one character to say ""If I was casting a horror picture, I'd have him play the murderer."" It's not one of the best of the series' entries, but it's still a decent entry and the DVD includes a featurette offering an excellent overview of Peter Lorre's career by his biographer Stephen Youngkin.

He may be a lot less mysterious now he's part of the `international police' and a bit less ruthless - though he does cause at least one murder - in Mysterious Mr. Moto, but it's a very satisfying fifth entry in the series that sees Moto escaping from Devil's Island with Leon Ames so he can work his way into the League of Assassins, of which his fellow runaway was a founder member. Posing as his manservant in London, he discovers their next target is Henry Wilcoxen's 'Steel King of Prague' in an undemanding but nonetheless entertaining yarn that takes in gin palaces in Limehouse, street markets in Soho and posh art galleries that all serve as the backdrop for murder. There aren't many surprises but it moves along at a brisk enough 63 minutes for that not to be the problem, and there's enough incident and action to make sure that none of them are dull. The stunt doubling is especially good considering Lorre, who had been overprescribed morphine and developed an addiction, was so weak he's unable to hold a tea cup and saucer without them very noticeably rattling in one scene and, while hardly realistic, 20th Century Fox's idea of Jolly Old England is a lot less unconvincing that Universal's.

The DVD also includes a 21-minute featurette on director Norman Foster.",1345507200,6,7562,4.750380517503805
2570168,5,B000FKO3U8,"This review covers both box sets, as well as the character Mr Moto for newcomers.

You're heard of Jackie Chan, but his lesser-known spiritual cousin Mr Moto is far less famous.

Throughout the late 30s/ealry 40s, Peter Lorre traded on his unconventional looks and perfect sense of timing in Hollywood ""quickies"". The resulting series, Mr Moto, is now brought to you in two box sets, beautifully restored, at a bargain price. If you come at this a rookie, as I did, there are many great pleasures to be had:

First, Peter Lorre. This is before he succumbed to self-parody, as a Hollywood newcomer fresh from Germany, and his huge successes there both in Fritz Lang's masterpiece M, and stage work for Brecht. Lorre makes this unique hero endlessly engaging, playing up Moto's coy charm and deceptive use of stereotypes.

Second, the films themselves. The formula is impressively efficient, up to 75 minutes of breezy, playful fun, with exotic locations, impressive - given the conceit - production values, and enough nostalgia to find a place in your heart. While some of the subplot romantic leads may be horrid actors and painfully bland, watching Moto run circles around them only enhances the viewing pleasure.

Third, the love. Most of these films were directed by Norman Foster, and while many historical documents reveal his contempt for the original material he was handed, you can't help but respect the work he put in trying to elevate it as much as he could, from reworking the script to delivering a breezy direction, replete with some really nifty fight scenes (an anarchic bar fight in Mysterious Mr Moto is a particular case in point).

Now for a quick episode guide:

- Think Fast, Mr. Moto (box set 1): our entry point and a great start, mysteries on a cruise ship, and some occasionally ruthless action from Mr Moto (5 stars)

- Thank You, Mr. Moto (box set 1): some Oriental mystery and tomb-raiding in this China-bound adventure. This one feels more like an exploitation-Tintin crossover, with some fun to be had despite some painful racial stereotyping (3 stars)

- Mr Moto Takes a Chance (box set 1): a wild adventure this one, also part Indiana Jones, but with the absurdity-factor amped up. Solid fun (4 stars)

- Mysterious Mr. Moto (box set 1): this one is more in the Arthur Conan-Doyle tradition, plots within plots, a mysterious league and some death-traps. As good as Mr Moto gets (5 stars)

- Mr Moto's Gamble (box set 2): some boxing action in this one, with Mr Moto in more of an observer's role, Gamble was not directed by Forster, and while there are some interesting new stylistic flourishes, this adventure lacks a bit of focus. It also saddles Moto with some annoying comic relief (3 stars)

- Mr Moto's Last Warning (box set 2): some international intrigue and pretty nasty villains in this adventure, definitely one of the better installments (5 stars)

- Mr Moto on Danger Island (box set 2): another non-Foster directed installment, this time with a hint of Agatha Christie, and Mr Moto teaching judo to a dimwitted but loyal wrestler (3.5 stars)

- Mr Moto's Vacation (box set 2): a fan-favorite, this one. Artifacts, a mysterious nemesis, traps in a museum, and masked villains. The irritating posh English comic relief is wearing thin, but everything else is pitch-perfect (4.5 stars)

The films do not share a specific chronological link, but the first film in box set 1 gives a more rounded introduction of the character. There has also been some complaint that quality dips in box set 2, which sometimes goes overboard on the comic relief. I have to confess I bought them both, after reading the excellent Lorre biography ""The Lost One"" and just went on a Moto binge, culminating, oddly and antichronologically, with M. Watching them in this quick a succesion does help you poke more fun at the formula (mystery + endangered romance subplot + hapless comic-relief + wink-wink ending) but also provides an interesting insight into how maleable the formula is.

Thank you Fox for releasing these.",1343347200,5,4042,4.861717612809316

I have been aware of Mr. Moto since childhood but never saw any of the movies until this year.  I especially liked the bonus features attached to the end of each movie.  Very interesting series if you like the 1930s action/adventure genre.  I can highly recommend this Vol 1 series.,1307664000,,388,4.803030303030303
2570175,5,B000FKO3U8,"The set (and its successor) are absolutely essential to all fans of 1930s early film noir and of Peter Lorre in particular.
For Lorre, this series, paired with Hitchcock's first (1934) ""Man Who Knew Too Much,"" are the critical bridge from the child-murderer Beckert of Lang's ""M"" to Ugarte of ""Casablanca"" and Joel Cairo (""Maltese Falcon""). This is an actor supremely superior to his vehicle. The plots,
characters, effects, etc. of ""Moto"" are pretty much thin, silly
cardboard, with pacing so rushed you'd think that someone was charging by the frame. But above it all is Moto (Lorre), who watches, silky and silent, and lets others - and the audience - guess as to his motives and actions. Even in the closings, when he reveals his identity and all is well, there's still a hint of menace in that self-deprecating smile and courtly courtesy; you believe that this man actually has killed people in the process. Some try to compare ""Moto"" with ""Charlie Chan""; ""Moto"" is far superior and far more adult.

Technically, the DVDs are superior. The restorations are excellent and the special features are few but nicely done. Marquand's writing is solid (if a bit ""modified"" for film). The predicatable problems are all in Direction: film noir was still in its infancy, and American directors hadn't yet learned to slow down and let the evil smile at us for a bit. Oriental stereotyping is still fairly evident, but less so than for
similar films (e.g., ""Chan"").

All told, an essential addition for all 1930s film and Peter Lorre lovers.",1242691200,4,1534,4.873563218390805

2570178,4,B000FKO3U8,"In one of the documentaries that is a bonus feature to the Mr. Moto collections,  the core difference between the two famous oriental detectives,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-Chan/dp/B000EXDSAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie Chan</a>&nbsp;and Mr. Moto, is set out plainly.  Charlie Chan, a member of the Honolulu police department, is one of us.  His speech patterns and aphorisms aside, he is an American who fights for the American ideals.  Mr. Moto, on the other hand, is not.  The Japanese detective works for an ill-defined ""International Police"" agency, and is a dangerous figure representing interests and ideals that are truly foreign.  He is ""the other"", who does not work in the best interest of America, but only in the interests of justice.

To me, this is what makes Mr. Moto more compelling than Charlie Chan.  Mr. Moto is not kind or sweet, and his intelligence is as deadly a weapon in his arsenal as his judo prowess.  Unassuming and seemingly harmless, no matter what happens you can be assured that Mr. Moto has something up his sleeve and will always come out on top, even if he has to traipse over bodies to get there.

This ""Mr. Moto Collection, vol 1"", contains four of the eight Peter Lorre Mr. Moto films, released between 1937 and 1939.  They are not in order, and this set has the first, second, fourth and fifth films.  The remainder can be found on Mr. Moto Collection vol 2.

Mr. Moto is a truly weird and dangerous character, who flings a man off a ship to his death without batting an eye.  He battles an international smuggling operation out of Shanghai.

The Mr. Moto film series are all b-movies, meaning that they were filmed using available sets from other movies in production at the time, and where cranked out at a steady pace.  Like the James Bond film series, some are based on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original-novels/dp/0517421844/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original novels</a>&nbsp;by John P.

This is a fantastic collection of these almost-forgotten films.  My only complaint is that, as each Mr. Moto film is quite short and rarely runs longer than an hour, there is no real need for four individual DVDs.  They could have saved space by packaging them on two DVDs, in a double-disk container.  It is nice having the original poster art for each disk, but the collection takes up way to much space on my shelf for the contents.",1234310400,7,4571,6.4892915980230645

2570186,5,B000FKO3U8,"Charlie Chan was such a great success for 20th Century Fox, they decided to produce a series with a Japanese detective.  Mr. Moto is based upon the fictional character of author John P. Marquand.

Peter Lorre in his first starring role performs the part of Mr. Motto perfectly.  However, Lorre was not well received by director, Norman Foster.  He thought Lorre was so much unlike the Japanese it would never work.  These films are actually credited for launching Lorre's acting career.

Mr. Moto is an inscrutable detective, a master of martial arts and an astute observer of human nature - the perfect detective.

There are two sets - Vol. One and Vol. Two, both are equally good.  Set #1 includes:  ""Think Fast, Mr. Moto"", ""Thank You, Mr. Moto"", ""Mr. Moto Takes a Chance"" and ""Mysterious Mr. Moto"".  Set #2 includes:  ""Mr. Moto's Gamble"", ""Mr. Moto in Danger Island"", ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning"" and ""Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation"".

Two other films featuring Mr. Moto were ""Stopover Tokyo (1957)"" and ""The Return of Mr. Moto (1965)"".  Neither featured Peter Lorre.

The original series starring Peter Lorre eventually ended during WWII, caused by brewing anti-Japanese feelings and war tensions.

2570202,5,B000FKO3U8,"Honorable ancestors can rejoice-- two detective series from the inscrutable east have been preserved on DVD for our delight and delectation. Honorable Charlie Chan, the Chinese detective, and wily Mr. Moto, the Japanese detective, two of the stalwarts of the Fox film series, stand up surprisingly well after nearly 70 years.

Addressing the issue of inherent racism and stereotyping first, yes, these films present Asians as outsiders, very different and strange, but gifted with near superhuman powers of observation.  However, it must be admitted that these characters are a far cry from the black Stepin Fetchits and gay Franklin Pangborns of the same period. Asians would suffer greatly at the hands of Hollywood before, during and after the Second World War, but these products of the '30s are considerably more benign, than, say, the Fu Manchu series, presenting an Asian as an arch demon.

Twentieth Century Fox has released four of the earliest films from each of the series, and while they are, frankly, B-movies, they are surprisingly well-made and entertaining.  We follow Chan through London in the first, Paris in the second, Egypt in the third, and finally Shanghai, where the sleuth solves a variety of killings with patient observations and little interaction.  On the other hand, Mr. Moto, who must think fast, take a chance, be simply mysterious, and then allow a thank you, seems something more of a hands-on secret agent than just a detective. Moto actually kills people, usually in self defense, and uses a bundle of disguises and subterfuges to solve his cases, which usually point more to international conspiracies than merely murder.

It's interesting than Chan was played by Warner Oland, a Swedish actor, and Moto by Peter Lorre, a German actor. As vehicles, the Chans seem a little weaker; the Motos not only seem more tightly conceived and cast, but also have the good fortune to be all directed by the same man, Norman Foster, who was one of Orson Welles' directors. In both series, the usual suspects of Hollywood's stock character performers pop up with alarming regularity, and Fox's B-unit, churned out by Sol Wurtzel at the rate of twice a month for over a decade, seems somehow a cut above the similar units at Warners and Metro. While none of these films can be called examples of cinematic greatness, they each run roughly a very fast 70 minutes, are engaging and unpretentious.  To perhaps snag a bit of the dialogue from either series, we should bow slightly at the waist in the direction of Twentieth Century Fox and say, ""Thank you so much.""",1158105600,27,2584,4.967592592592593
2570203,5,B000FKO3U8,"20th Century Fox Home Entertainment present ""MR. MOTO COLLECTION VOL. 1"", featuring Peter Lorre as Mr. Kentaro Moto is a fictional Japanese secret agent created by the American author John P. Marquand and not much like the fictional Chinese detective Charlie Chan (a much more benevolent and likable character). Moto's name is apparently an alias, and he is better known simply as Mr. Moto....Moto is small in stature but strong and an expert in judo. He was the title character of a series of books, beginning with No Hero (1935; British title: Mr. Moto Takes a Hand, reprint title: Your Turn, Mr. Moto), and of eight films between 1937 and 1939, in which he was portrayed by Peter Lorre. With the beginning of World War II, Mr. Moto fell out of favor with Americans, and no new books or movies about him appeared between 1942 and 1957....Marquand originally created Moto for the Saturday Evening Post, which encouraged him to write Asian flavored mystery stories after the death of Charlie Chan's creator, Earl Derr Biggers

Special footnote, actor Peter Lorre (June 26, 1904 - March 23, 1964), born Ladislav (Lszl) Lwenstein, was a stage and screen actor of Austrian descent especially known for playing roles with sinister overtones in Hollywood crime films and mysteries....He began acting on stage in Vienna, Breslau, and Zrich. In the late 1920s he moved to Berlin where he worked with German playwright Bertolt Brecht. The German speaking actor became famous when Fritz Lang cast him as a child killer in his 1931 film ""M""....then London where he played a charming villain in Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"".... When he arrived in Great Britain, his first meeting was with Hitchcock and by smiling and laughing as Hitchcock talked, the director was unaware that Lorre had a limited command of the English language. During the filming of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", Lorre learned much of his part phonetically.....Eventually, he went to Hollywood where he specialized in playing wicked or wily foreigners. He starred in a series of ""Mr. Moto"" films, a parallel to the better known ""Charlie Chan"" series, in which he played a Japanese detective and spy created by John P. Marquand....Lorre enjoyed considerable popularity as a featured player in Warner Bros. suspense and adventure films. Lorre played the role of Joel Cairo in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and played the role of ""Ugarte"" in the film classic ""Casablanca"" (1942). He played Dr. Einstein in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944-filmed in 1941). It was Lorre's character who introduced the ""letters of transit"" (there was no such thing in reality) which became, in some ways, the dramatic center of the film.....But Hollywood never fully tapped Lorre's creative powers.

Want to thank 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment for taking us back to those classic murder, mystery, mayhem with our fictional Japanese secret agent Mr. Kenturo. Moto...watching this legendary actor and his professional team of directors, writers as created by the American author John P. Marquand served up the best of the best during those early films of our favorite detective...wonderful character actors of the cinema brought back so many wonderful memories of the times when film makers cared about you who purchased a ticket and came back for more.

I especially enjoy finding that there are snippets of the original film that were taken out of the TV versions.

2570206,5,B000FKO3U8,"I've long been a fan of JP Marquand's Mr Moto novels. Although Mr Moto is Japanese, all stories center on China, and therefore the volatile decade of the 1930s. Japan had taken over part of China in 1931, and took much of China proper beginning in 1937. The Mr Moto stories take place against that background. They are masterfully written by a reknowned American writer, even though clearly for a magazine-type popular readership.

The films have nothing to do with the stories at all, save for a title or two and the character of Mr Moto. That's fine with me. The stories appeal to me for their writing, not for their plots, but I wanted to see what the US film world of the 1930s was doing with this fine fictional character. I was a bit anxious, because I had obtained and watched volume 1 of the Charlie Chan DVD collection, and although I liked the ""talking heads"" portion of the DVD set, I thought the films only barely watchable.

What a delightful surprise. The films seem to have a slightly higher production value (they're not quite so tied to the soundstage environment of the B movies of the day), but what makes them such a wonderful experience to watch 70 years later is the portrayal of Mr Moto by Peter Lorre. I think that the scripts are better than the Chan movies, too, but time and time again it is the impressiveness of Lorre that saves a hokey scene or adds the necessary touch of seriousness to a situation frought with camp.

I won't get a second volume of Charlie Chan, but most assuredly will buy the second volume of Mr Moto, if it is produced. Might I add that the restoration of the films is also most remarkable. They look better on my widescreen TV than they ever did in the movie theater.",1154563200,77,1720,4.453968253968254
2570207,5,B000FKO3U8,"This is a really great set from Fox.  The prints are fantastic and the extras are really interesting.  The Moto films are forgotten classics and it is great that viewers can now discover or rediscover them!
