1082051,5,6305773955,Great Film! Story is untouched by Hollywood flair and fantasy because you  just can't make this stuff up. There came a point in the film when I  realized I had taken for granted that this was just a movie. Then I  realized that their very survival rested on each and every step they took  forward. If you think your life is stressful and unrewarding this movie  will inspire you. Riveting!,959644800,11,389,4.5
1082155,5,6305773955,The fact that the subject of this amazing film took place during my lifetime is awesome.  The human spirit and determination and courage are seldom displayed so dramatically.,1209686400,2,174,5.214285714285714
1082156,4,6305773955,"I could have done without the first 20 or so minutes of this silent film documentary which presented the camera crew's journey from Constantinople to the mountain foothills in Iran. Those scenes felt heavily edited and seemed tame compared to what the Bakhtiari tribesmen were going to go thru in the balance of the movie.

The remaining 50 minutes or so flew by as I watched these nomads with their pack animals and herds cross an icy river, climb the precipitous slopes of a mountain, cross its snowy summit before descending into a warm valley of pasture lands for their herds. It was an incredible glimpse of a vanishing lifestyle. The only defect in my view was the use jokey title cards (eg, ""Brrr"", ""Brrr"" when crossing the chilly river) ruining my sense of involvement.

50 years later, in 1976, another documentary, this time in color, would once again follow these people in equally fascinating detail. That film was called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/People-of-the-Wind/dp/6305869316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">People of the Wind</a>. I recommend seeing both since each gives some details that the other doesn't.

(According to Wikipedia, as of 2006 a small percentage of Bakhtiari still made the journey -- but with transport for the herds and they didn't go barefoot in the snow.)",1189728000,2,1340,5.401913875598086
1082157,5,6305773955,"This is one of the most important films ever made about tribal nomadic life, and the rigors of the filmmaking process make it all the more astonishing. The film does practice a bit of romanticism that was completely unnecessary. It pretends that the Bakhtiari tribe are making their migration as a one-time desperate bid for survival. In fact the Bakhtiari make this 250 km. journey twice every year, and they are still doing it, though they now do some of it by road. The film is inspiring, breath-taking and miraculous for the time it was shot. It belongs in the annals of the best film classics.",1178496000,4,598,4.650943396226415
1082158,5,6305773955,"You absolutely, positively MUST see this movie.  Merion C. Cooper, director of the original (1930's) King Kong & two other Americans filmed this incredible exodus in 1927.  With heavy, old camera equipment.  In the winter.  In the mountains of Iran.  By foot and mule.  And their subjects are utterly awe inspiring.

I first saw this silent, B&W documentary in 2005.  I was right in the middle of packing for a huge, draining household move from the mountains of New Mexico to Texas.  My husband was sick, I was utterly exhausted, and I was just 3 days out from the moving company's arrival.  I sat down at midnight & caught this on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) and was so inspired I promised to never complain about modern moving again (and I haven't)!

These Iranian tribesman undertake an annual pilgrimage across the most challenging terrain you would ever believe humans could traverse JUST TO GET THEIR ANIMALS TO GRASS.  They walk barefoot through the snow.  Herding  cattle and sheep and horses.  With cradles on their backs.  And dogs tied to the tops of the animals.  They cross freezing meltwaters on inflatable goatskins.

If I hadn't seen it myself, I wouldn't believe it. Anyone with a sense of adventure has got to see this one!!!",1166832000,7,1244,4.787735849056604
1082159,5,6305773955,I first saw the film on the TCM on Silent Sunday Night.  I was impressed then and am still impressed.  What indurance these people must have.,1163203200,,141,4.384615384615385
1082160,3,6305773955,"In the early 1920s, the creators of King Kong, Merian C. Cooper and his partner Ernest B. Schoedseck, were fledgling filmmakers when they shot GRASS: A NATION'S BATTLE FOR LIFE.

In dramatic black and white, silent, with music score added later, this account of the Persian (now Iran) Bakhtiarian tribe's annual migration is as gripping as the like-minded People of the Wind (also available on DVD).

This great companion piece to the later and similar film reveals how minimal the changes -- besides fewer numbers, only 50,000 persons -- in the routines over the intervening 50 years between the films.

I like this film's artistry (Shoedsack's photography) and the bold theatrical sense of Cooper's direction.  It's the same journey but with different people and from a more primitive and perhaps more daring perspective.

Unrated. Genre: Adventure documentary. 1 hour, 21 minutes. Director: Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Shoedsack and Marguerite Harrison.",1158451200,5,956,5.304635761589404
1082161,5,6305773955,"This remarkable film easily fits on the same shelf with the finest early documentaries, such as Nanook of the North, Silent Enemy and Man of Aran, whose aim was to capture on film ways of life that were in the process of passing away and now no longer exist.  What sets this one apart from the others is that in this film there was a real effort to achieve authenticity and not to create a false (even if ""true in spirit"") narrative as a backdrop for the plot.  In all of the other films mentioned there was a fairly substantial artificiality to the story that was used to retain interest in the material (i.e. they show natives engaging in activities that they no longer engage in, or that they rarely engage in; they set up little dramas; this is something that Schoedsack and Cooper found they needed to do for the success of their next film: Chang; but here they tried to be more naturalistic).  In this case, there are two narratives that undergird the document: the story of Schoedsack and Cooper themselves (who remain for the most part in the background) and of the woman who accompanied them (Marguerite Harison); the second is the story of the tribal leader and his young son who will someday take the mantel of the father and lead the villagers along the same journey.  While there is some staging of these ""stories,"" it is less complex than in the other films and retains a ring of authenticity -- the boy really will have to become a leader and the crew really did make it across (it is also interesting to note that they include a mark of the authenticity of their journey in the film by filming a signed affidavit from a local authority that they had in fact completed the trek).  The real ""heroes"" of the story, whose actions could not be faked, were the tribe as a whole who had to walk barefoot over snowy mountains to bring their animals to pasture.

In addition to a compelling portrait of a passing way of life, which is full of poignant and witty intertitles and small moments that humanize the massive scope of the operation, the film has a  subtext which is to remind American audiences that they have ""gone soft"" -- that they have lost the hardiness of their pioneer ancestors and that these living people retain it.  This is a message that Schoedsack and Cooper remind us of in their subsequent fictional masterpiece: King Kong.",1117065600,21,2354,4.535377358490566
1082162,5,6305773955,"This 1925 silent film documentary is not for everybody.  The first half is irrelevant and slow, and the commentary is hokey.  I was surprised there were no dramatic Hollywood scenes of people falling off cliffs.  But what I got instead was a historical record of 50,000 people and 500,000 animals walking for 48 days across Persia to avoid famine.  It's hard to believe that these are real people, genuinely swimming for their lives, crossing a half-mile of freezing rapids holding on to blown up goat skins.  We are so used to seeing things staged, that it's hard to accept that they really are climbing that 12,000 foot mountain in their bare feet, to get a better grip in the ice and snow.",1070668800,32,692,4.639344262295082

For the last few months I have seen many DVD silent ""classics"" -- a subject I avoided in the the VHS area because of variable quality and the difficulty in reading the subtitles. So, I saw the excellent reviews for this unknown (to me) silent, and decided to purchase it. The film is truly awesome (not the teen-ager word, but the correct denotation of awesome). To see people living and surviving in a most hostile environment less that one hundred years ago was transfiguring. We might as well have seen actual footage of the same migration from the 1500s! It was a contemporary time capsule to the past, and although the narrative titles are naive and sometimes silly -- well, that was another time.

7895947,4,6305773955,"Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life (Merian C. Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack, 1925)

If you're one of those people who doesn't like silent movies just because they're silent (and therefore, probably, old), there are three things you should know about Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life. First, that Haidar Khan, the leader of the nomadic band under consideration here, with his chiseled features and distinctive mustache, could pass for a silent-era Omar Sharif. Okay, stop swooning, ladies, and start reading again. Second is that the cinematography here rivals that in Brokeback Mountain, even eighty years beforehand and with much more primitive technology. Thirdly, if you don't recognize the names, Cooper and Schoedsack would, seven years later, go on to make one of the all-time iconic American movies: King Kong. Is that enough to get you watching?

The basic idea is that Cooper, Schoedsack, and Marguerite Harrison (interesting note: both Cooper and Harrison were spies, and both spent time in Russian prison for that very reason) accompanied the Bakhtyari, a poor, nomadic tribe (called Persian in the interstitial titles, but they seem to spend half the year in Iran and the other half in Turkey) who traverse the highest mountain in the Urals twice yearly with their herds and fifty thousand tribesmen in order to find arable grazing land. (I spent a lot of time wondering why they didn't just stay in Iran, instead of going back to the harsh desert near Ankara every year, but Cooper never addresses this.) Yeah, that's pretty much it. The tribe find hardships aplenty, but Cooper and Schoedsack attempt to turn the whole thing into a rousing tale of the human spirit.

Watching a movie like this over eighty years after it was made, it's almost impossible to imagine the American culture into which this film (and its predecessor, Nanook of the North--often considered the first ethnographic documentary, at least until it was discovered that parts of it were staged) dropped like a bombshell. Obviously, neither the Internet nor television had been invented, and film and telephones were still newfangled inventions. (Sound in film was still a year away.) One of the reasons that Murnau's Sunrise, released in 1927, was such a huge hit was that it resonated with people; most filmgoers had never actually traveled to the big city. Most of them had, unless they'd been in the military, never left their hometowns; the automobile was also a newfangled beast at the time. They may have heard of Persia and Turkey, but few, if any, had ever been there, and what you could read in the encyclopedias of the time was mostly subjective. And here was a chance for otherwise provincial people to see, with their own eyes, the layout of a piece of a country on the other side of the ocean, where the people may not have ever heard of America. That sort of thing is inconceivable today; in 1925, it was more the norm than the exception. ""New"" doesn't even begin to cover it.

Of course, novels of the Orient and various Rudolph Valentino films and the like had been set in Asia, though an Asia that had been wrung through the filter of ""what can we change to make all this more dramatic?"", and Cooper and Schoedsack certainly did that sort of thinking when writing their title cards; the word choice shows obvious hints of manipulation, and who knows how much of what we're told is in context? (There's also at least one scene that is, if not staged, obviously manipulated; we watch the same tent being dismantled three or four times in rapid succession.) But as far as my admittedly quick and dirty research has been able to uncover, Grass was never touched by the same scandal that hit Nanook of the North, and is still considered the first really accurate ethnographic documentary. It has obviously lost some of its ""wow"" factor over the years, but you take one look at this cinematography and you understand where generations of cameramen have gotten their inspiration. (As I mentioned in the first paragraph, the scene from Brokeback Mountain with the thousands upon thousands of head of cattle coming up the mountain? That is straight out of Grass, camera angle and all.) Very well worth your time. ****",1248739200,,4209,4.874301675977653
7895948,5,6305773955,This video is one of the most astounding things I have ever seen.  It is unbelievable to me what these people went through every year in their travels just to survive.  I have watched it again and again!  I would give it 10 stars if I could.,1246579200,2,241,4.085106382978723
7895949,5,6305773955,"Everyone I've shown this movie to was breathless with amazement, and this covers a 5 year old to a 90 year old (my son and father). Really two films, the first part shows the trek of the makers east across Turkey in 1925, with little vignettes to get to know the area. ""Highway patrol"" on camel-back. Hunting a wild goat with an ancient gun and incredible skill. A ""camel-stop"" not unlike a truck stop.

Then you meet the tribe, a mobile city of people and their animals, which they seem to live entirely off of. Cross raging rivers, take off your shoes when you get to the ice fields so as not to tear them, carry sick livestock on your shoulders. Simply more amazing than any acrobat, magician, athlete, or performer, you can barely believe your eyes.

More dramatic than Nanook of the North, but very similar. Both are worthwhile for every modern human to see.",1217548800,3,863,4.5256410256410255
