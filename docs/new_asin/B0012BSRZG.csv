8244976,1,B0012BSRZG,Not at all what I was expecting. I thought it would be an actual documentary and it was some ridiculous spoof.,1425081600,,110,4.285714285714286
8244977,1,B0012BSRZG,"I went to a private screening of this.  It was so boring and such a mess I nearly walked out. It made no sense at all.  Only out of loyalty to Brandon and Ayers, who produced this mess, did I stay.  Come on, guys.  You get money to make a film and THIS is what you make?  Brandon, stick to magic.",1325462400,,296,3.7868852459016393
8244978,2,B0012BSRZG,"This is a sometimes humorous film for those familiar with all the facts surrounding UFOs, abduction lore. Production values OK. Acting adequate. I was not very impressed with this film.",1200355200,3,185,5.2
8244979,5,B0012BSRZG,"I was impressed with the ease in which I was able to download the film.
I did have to wait a while, but I was still able to work on my computer
as I waited. After several minutes, once the download was in progress
I was able to start enjoying the film. I was very impressed with the quality of the
picture and sound. This is the first time I watch a movie download on my computer.
I have a fairly nice size screen so the experience was rich and engaging.
I had seen the movie in a movie theatre before but  I had a few friends over who had never seen it nor had ever watched a movie download. It was just like watching T.V.  We all enjoyed the ride. The film was wacky and intriguing, colorful and quite epic for an INDI Film.
After my guests spent most of the time laughing though the movie, they wanted to know what was real and what was not, and wanted more info on UFOs and the Alien Human Hybrid. The music was also great.  Getting these kind of movies online anytime I want is cool. The future is here and it's been worth the wait.",1184457600,4,1037,4.048780487804878
