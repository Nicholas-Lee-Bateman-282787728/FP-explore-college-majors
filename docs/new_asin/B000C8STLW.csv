2454032,1,B000C8STLW,The headline is the review but since I was prompted to write more words ******* here they are. I was told by a machine I need two more words so here are more words.,1364688000,3,164,3.8529411764705883
2454033,1,B000C8STLW,This is a poorly executed attempt at spoof slapstick comedy made famousr by leslie nielsen! What a legend rip my good man. Anyway just a awful movie. Not funny terrible acting. And this is feldmans movie. He actually had to fire his best friend corey haim because haim was to HIGH on drugs during this movie. But it was probably a good thing haim wasn't in it cuz haim is a amazing person and actor and this movie is just a slap in the face. Rip haim! I own every feldman movie. (And haim movie) even this one.  I even own redline(feldman is in it for a min) amd never too late(haim only a few min too) so im a die hard fan. But this is one of the worst pieces of crap ever made. Up there with trancers 6is and puppet master axis rising. Stay away from this please. Go rent lost boys or dream a lil dream 1and2 or blown away.,1357603200,5,825,4.061349693251533
2454034,3,B000C8STLW,"Corey Haim is on the cover,but is only in the movie a very short time. The DVD transfer looked like it came from a VHS tape.",1352505600,,124,3.8076923076923075
2454035,5,B000C8STLW,Alright so it's not the greatest movie ever made. But I find it so dumb and corny that it's funny. Also a good addition to anyone's 'Coreys' Collection.,1347840000,,152,4.464285714285714
2454036,3,B000C8STLW,"They sure picked a good title for this movie, the two Corey's were never going to win an oscar for their acting abilities but this one takes the cake, the plot is just as bad as the acting and there are alot of cliches but I will say for all the cheesy jokes it does have some entertaining quality (and I do mean some) Haim only has a few scenes whereas Feldman is the main character and lead actor, the reason for Haim having limited screen time was due to his alleged heavy drug use at the time of the movie's filming, if you are a fan of either Corey, you might get a laugh or two but don't expect much, their earlier films together (and seperate) are way more enjoyable.",1327017600,,674,4.152671755725191
2454037,2,B000C8STLW,"I guess Corey Feldman really got a kick out of being in ""National Lampoons Loaded Weapon"" and really wanted to do a movie like it where he was in it for more then 15 seconds.

However, he really did not hit the mark of good slap-stick humor. Some jokes where funny, but most fell flat on there face. I guess there is not much more you can do then silly one liners when the entire plot, if you can call it that, of the movie is a corrupt Miami police station where no crime seems to happen, because they moved all the prostitutes into the police station and treat there prisoner's like they where running a hotel. However the Mayor has sent a new female Captain to overlook the station for a while to find out if the rumors are true of a corrupt station.

Without having much of a plot, Corey Feldmen's movie making debut needed someone to tell Corey that you need a decent plot, not just a lot of boobs to make a good movie. I could actually see this movie having been a big success had the girls not just done a bit of stripping and flirt there fake implants around, but have just made it a full on porno movie where the jokes would have fit right in as people would be fast forwarding past them anyway.

But it's not a porno movie, it's just an excuse for Corey and his friends to have fun with each other and see a lot of skin around them... like i'm sure he sold the two girls in the shower with him in one fantasy scene of his by saying, ""this is really vital to the movie ladies, if I don't shower with you, it will ruin the entire outcome of this movie""

I can't see why they bothered to get Corey Haim in for the movie, he was well worth promoting as a leading man on the cover and having his name in the first credits after Feldmen's when he appears out of no where 40 mins into the movie, then disappears just as quick. Maybe he saw the movie was so bad he left filming, or Corey begged him to be in it to try and aid something more to it... either way, it fails.

I did kind of enjoy watching the movie tho, it was just so lame and cheesy I could not turn away, I wanted to see just how lame it could get by the end, and it gets there.

I found this on DVD as a double feature with ""The Willies"" starring Sean Austin... and I must say I take my hats off to the company who combined a PG rated movie with an R rated one. Makes perfect sense doesn't it?",1230595200,6,2362,4.014893617021277
2454038,3,B000C8STLW,"Well as I said in the review title, this is Corey Feldman's directorial debut movie. First off you must have a since of humor for the raunchy, corky, out of nowhere comedy to watch this movie or a Big Corey Feldman fan. Secondly I'm all of the above, so let's get into it. This movie seems like it is all over the place by mixing formulas of comedy seen in movies such as airplane or naked gun series times 3. The sketches just keep coming with out of nowhere things such as a girl in bikini walking a letter J across the street and getting busted while 2 guys rob a store in the background. Even the music cues are wild everytime someone says peeping tom is funny. The shower scene wow the women get a star alone they are fine I mean getting strip search by a stripper is a twist (this isn't for kids). All in all if your looking for a blend of sexy, silly, unexpected things that are expected to what the characters say type of comedy directed by Corey Feldman this it. A b-movie worth adding to your Feldman collection, oh yeah Haim's is in this movie but with very little parts he was having those problems at the time, but his character is cool. The acting is where it suppose to be for a comedy so that is how I'm grading the movie.",1229817600,,1238,4.184100418410042
2454039,1,B000C8STLW,"This movie was pretty painful to watch, and I am a huge Corey & Corey fan. There are some pretty ridiculous soft core porn scenes with corey feldman that are borderline disturbing... The movie is not funny, makes little sense (and I usually enjoy movies that don't make any sense), and it just plain terrible. Looks like something skin-a-max would show at 3am... Dont buy this unless you just have to have every corey feldman film.",1181520000,9,431,4.684210526315789
2454040,1,B000C8STLW,I was very disappointed with this movie. The box cover compares it to Airplane & Naked Gun which are funny movies. This movie is not funny it is stupid. They TRY to be funny with crappy site gags and over the top dialog that just annoy the viewer. And I mean everyone I let watch it. Save your money and buy a good comedy that you can laugh at cause this one ain't it. It's about a Z grade at best. I gave it one star because that was the lowest number I could set it to but it should be a minus 10 star movie,1177113600,4,509,3.811320754716981
2454041,2,B000C8STLW,"I gotta say i think that this film is bad for many reason's,first it had so limited release and the storyline is stupid and what the hell is Corey Feldman doing directing when really he should stick to music after all his onl good years were the 80's and that was between 85 and 89. The storyline is simple a group of California cops fool around with women and that is the cue for lots of nudity and joke's and believe me the jokes ... but all of the sudden Feldman must get his act together and the rest of the cops as the new boss in charge has plans for them and beleive me they are not interesting what so ever they ...Another of my problems was that Corey Haim was in it and he might aswell of not bothered he is involved for like 20 minutes of the film and his role is really ... and that is the warning to Haim fans wanting this as part of your collection don't buy it thinking he is joint star with Feldman like there other movie's cause he isn't,if you want a good movie with these two in there prime and at there best buy The Lost Boys,License to Drive or Dream a little Dream.",1010707200,7,1087,4.06046511627907

Another Corey film left on the shelf!",1392768000,,151,4.392857142857143

8096420,2,B000C8STLW,"I dig the Two Corey's, but this film is by far the worst Two Corey Film ever. I thought Dream A Little Dream II was the worst one but this one takes the cake. The acting is horrible. The story line is very generic!!!!! If you're curious like me about this movie just Rent it DO NOT BUY IT WHAT SO EVERY! Did I mention Feldman produced this?!?!
