For those who are serious in learning what went on in WW II, this Video collection will bring you up to speed and provide alot of information and knowledge which you will otherwise take a very long time to accumulate and learn.

I learned more than I could have learned by any other means, be it books, movies, lectures. This should be required viewing by student over the age of 15.",1194998400,26,324,4.603448275862069
