I own many of these old hot rod flicks and we try to get together at least every other month to ""Review"" at least one with some ""frosty beverages"".

8098332,3,B000CEVC6A,Cute little movie that I actually owned on 16mm film and had not seen it in years so when it came out on DVD I bought it and I rated it just good because it is not the best quality copy but it has a good story centered on driving safely and the background for the story is the 1950's,1289865600,,283,3.7333333333333334
8098333,5,B000CEVC6A,"This movie is a real treat for fans of teenage hot rod movies. I didn't even know such a thing existed this early. It was made in 1947 - about ten years before the classic run of fifties JD flicks. Anyway, this is just swell! It's filmed nicely, well-acted, but most importantly it has cool hot rods and drag racing! Some creepy horror moments as well. My favorite part may have been all the great slang used here (did you know they were saying ""groovy in 1947?). I don't know why this flick seems to be so obscure. I'd put it up there with ""Hot Rod Gang"", ""High School Confidential"" and ""Loving You"" (Elvis!) - but it's from the forties! Keen!",1184544000,4,644,4.330578512396694
8098334,3,B000CEVC6A,"John Clark (Damian O'Flynn) is a successful real estate broker with a wife (Lenita Lane) and three children, 24-year old ex-Navy flier Jeff (James Cardwell), 16-year old Micky (Darryl Hickman), and little Judy.  After lecturing Micky about racing cars, John picks up his own big, new car and takes the family out to the lake, speeding and weaving his way along until there is a minor accident involving Judge Roger Tanner (William Forrest) and his daughter Sue (Noreen Nash).  Once unrepentant John gets a suspended sentence, Jack recruits Micky to help Jack start to woo Sue at the country club swimming pool.  Then Micky has his own hot rod ready to go and the trouble starts.

When Micky, his best friend Todd (Robert Arthur), and their girl friends, Peggy (Sue England) and Rusty (Terry Moore), respectively, go off to drag race, the authorities shut the race down and warn the parents.  Later, when the teen foursome are on the beach late at night, they hear on the radio that an unidenfified hot rodder was killed in a plunge off a cliff.  Thinking they may know the person, they sneak into the county morgue, where they learn the truth.  There is a chase, an accident, consequences, and some resolutions.

There is actually quite a lot of story and character evolution packed into this film, all rather well told and acted.  The explicit thrust of the film is that parents must supervise and be responsible for the behavior of their children.  Setting a good example is key.  No one is sent to therapy or counseling; acting up is inevitable if there is no supervision.  Although the bulk of the time is spent with Micky and friends, the father's belated acceptance of his share of blame is the climax.

This is a black and white film made in 1947.  Things are swell and keen.  Most girls have standards.  The drag race and driving scenes have a few special effects.  The youthful leads and their significant others all have bathing suit scenes, but there is no sex or bad language.  The picture quality and sound are all right but show some wear.  The box says the film is 67 minutes long.

One character says she's psycho-neurotic and trots out other psycho-babble; it's funny.

There are no extras, other than Alpha Video's catalog and some previews.

This is a good, inexpensive film that makes its points well.",1157673600,9,2321,4.721393034825871
