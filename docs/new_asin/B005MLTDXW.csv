8479492,5,B005MLTDXW,"I watched this film with no preconceptions at all, because I didn't know a thing about it at all and had bought it as a birthday present. Sometimes the best things in life are like this, pleasant surprises that delight you and make you feel good inside, and this film definitely made me feel good and I am glad I bought it and glad I watched it.

It's a road movie with a difference; it's two connected stories, connected only in the sense that both stories are related to Wales and Welsh people. One story is the descendant of a Welsh settler to Patagonia going 'back home' to Wales, a country she's never been to before and with hardly any of the Welsh language at her grasp, and the other story is a Welsh couple going to explore the vastness of Patagonia which is a part of Argentina. In 1865 about 150 Welsh settlers left Wales, going from Liverpool, to start a new life in Patagonia to get away from the English subjugation (yes sadly that seems to have still been going on then) and the low wages of the coal mines. They wanted to find paradise in their new home, but did they? I think their descendants are doing well now but those early settlers had a struggle, a real struggle. Of such, legends are born.

The way both stories intertwine with each other is very clever, and both Wales and Patagonia never looked more beautiful; this is certainly the Welsh Tourist Board's dream I think! So, a little of the story, but not too much as it's worth seeing the film; the first involves an old lady and her neighbour's grandson(?) who decide to explore Wales to find the old farm that her mother left all those years back to come to Patagonia. They explore Wales by bus and meet various characters on their way, some nice and some crazy, as you'll see. In the end, the old lady never leaves Wales... The second story is a Welsh couple who are having trouble conceiving and are travelling around Patagonia to photograph old Welsh churches around the wastes of Patagonia. After a misunderstanding, the Welsh girl runs off with a Patagonian, and the guy disappears and gets drunk in a bar... at the end, they do I think get back together... and the old lady in the other story finds her heart's desire.

This is a film I thoroughly enjoyed; I love road movies of all kinds anyway, from 'Wild Strawberries' by Ingmar Bergman, to 'the Motorcycle Diaries'. There's a sense in this film that each person will find what it is they are looking for, even though they have to go on a journey to find it, whatever 'it' is. There's a dreamer in all of us, and we all want to find our dreams; that's the message of this film I think: go and search for your dreams, you just might find them...",1370390400,3,2682,4.403225806451613
8479493,5,B005MLTDXW,"Director Marc Evans (""Snow Cake"") gives us two separate stories. The first is about residents of Chubut, a Welsh territory in southern Argentina that was founded in the 1860s by colonists who left Wales for greener pastures; they settled in Patagonia with the assistance of the Argentine government. A very elderly woman enlists the aid of a teenage neighbor to help her travel to Buenos Aires for treatment on her eyes. To his surprise, her plan is to slip off to Wales and seek the old family farm. All she has is a faded photograph and stunned teenage boy to help her.

The second story begins in Wales, where a photographer has landed a contract to travel to Chubut and photograph the many chapels that are scattered amid the panoramic landscapes. To his delight, his girlfriend asks if she might come along. The driver hired for their trek is a farmer from the area, so the three of them speak Welsh and Spanish (with captions when necessary). Welsh actor Matthew Rhys (""Brothers & Sisters"") is the driver. The photographer sees an attraction begin to grow between his girlfriend and their driver.

These two stories never intersect, although they are edited so we switch back and forth. The teenager and the elderly woman suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as they travel to rural Wales, while the driver makes things much easier for our threesome in Patagonia. It was interesting to note that those three characters in the romantic triangle become more and more attractive as the movie goes on, particularly the driver. Some of us gals in line for the 2010 Seattle International Film Festival press screening were in total agreement about HIM!

Director Marc Evans can do more with a glance than most directors can do with complete nudity and sweaty bodies. Whew!

8479494,4,B005MLTDXW,"First note that despite the incorrect information in the editorial review, the language of this film is NOT English. It is filmed in Welsh and Spanish with only a small amount of English and English subtitles. It has been nominated by BAFTA for the 2012 Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Picture.
This is the story of two journeys; not epic Odyssey type journeys but real people looking for their lives.  Rhys and Gwen are having relationship issues. They are a Welsh speaking couple living near Cardiff; Rhys is a photographer and Gwen works at the St Fagans Museum of Welsh Folk Life. He gets a commission to go to the Welsh community in Patagonia - the Wladfa - (settled in 1865 by Welsh people trying to get as far away from the English as they could go) and photograph old Welsh chapels there. Cerys is an elderly Argentinian lady whose mother came from Wales in 1927, sent by her family because of the ""shame"" of her being pregnant. Alejandro is a young teenage Argentinian of unclear relation to Cerys. They travel to Wales looking for the old farm Nant Biallu where Cerys's mother once lived.
The photography of both Patagonia and Wales is breath taking. The editing of the two stories is extremely well done and the flow of the two stories/journeys moves very well.
The story line has been criticized as weak, but for the message being presented it is the right level; not overwhelming emotionally not completely bland either. The characters are well developed with its share of the odd (Martin in Patagonia) and the unpleasant (the young punks in the North Wales diner who take advantage of Alejandro and Cerys).
The ending has a great deal of poignancy and I would recommend that any one planning on seeing the movie first research the saga of Treweryn that occurred in the late 20s early 30s.  Unfortunately the ""Viking"" funeral at the end is totally out of place and I doubt that the local authorities would have found it amusing at all.",1322438400,6,1953,4.690962099125365
