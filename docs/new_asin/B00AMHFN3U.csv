5451281,4,B00AMHFN3U,"An hour and forty minutes of breezy, entertaining and informative documentary evidence that Mudhoney were and still remain the most sincere expression of Seattle's '90s musical heyday.  Excellent summaries of each member's earliest musical experiences and influences, and equal and honest overviews of each era of the band's career to date. Editing and sound are both excellent and the film manages to avoid nearly every documentary cliche while still hitting all the bases. I'm taking one star away because the bonus material could have been more comprehensive, such as including a compilation of all the videos used in the documentary or more full live performances within the film itself, a la The Kids Are Alright. Still, this is the best Mudhoney video document to date and I suspect it will remain so for years to come. Recommended.",1362960000,,838,5.116788321167883
5451282,5,B00AMHFN3U,This is a must see for any ROCK-N-ROLL fan.  The  fact that it's MUDHONEY is a cherry on top.  A truly great and legendary band who still does it their own way.  Long live MUDHONEY!,1448409600,,181,4.085714285714285
5451283,5,B00AMHFN3U,"The ordinary tradition of rockumentaries is to blow the lid off of scandals, illuminate lurid details, analyze controversy. Focus on drama. There's very little of that here. Mudhoney's story is relatively easy-breezy. It's just the story of a bunch of really cool laid back guys who formed a band, made a huge splash and had moderate levels of success and no particularly extreme peaks and valleys. Never really ever crashed and burned, but petered out on a few occasions, came back and are still going. For the most part, it's a very fun and pleasurable watch. Pretty sure I had a big smile on face throughout most of it. (Though that might be because I also happened to be imbibing vodka & grape soda at the time.) The most ""dramatic"" thing I can remember is Lukin describing his exit from the Melvins. It lasted about 10 seconds but it was kinda the highlight for me. Even the drug ""problems"" described in the movie are no big deal.

Watching this reminded me of what happened when I watched the Circle Jerks documentary, followed a similar pattern. I loved Mudhoney's first few records, but then I burned out and left them behind. I remember picking up a copy of My Brother the Cow on the new releases rack and then going ""Nah"" and putting it back down. That was as far as I rode their bandwagon. I honestly wasn't aware that they put anything out after that, I just stopped paying attention. One thing I learned from this doc is that while I might have burned out, Mudhoney didn't- they somehow managed to avoid jumping the shark. They released tons of great records that I missed out on, and now I'm working on getting caught up with their backlog.",1431993600,,1654,4.569023569023569
5451284,5,B00AMHFN3U,"As good as any ""rock doc"" available.  Mudhoney were an underground phenomenon, largely responsible for the Seattle scene of the 90s.  There would have been no Nirvana without them.  The film tells the story of the band before, during and after the rise and fall of ""grunge"" through interviews with everyone involved, as well as news clips and videos.  If you're a fan, see it.",1420675200,,376,4.7384615384615385
5451285,3,B00AMHFN3U,"I like grunge rock and, if you do, you may like this movie about that type of band. Clearly the band embodies joy of playing music rather than the Rolling Stone magazine bulls*** hype that surrounds it.",1417392000,,202,4.486486486486487
5451286,5,B00AMHFN3U,"Whoa!  This was an excellent documentary.  During the 90's era, I liked Mudhoney, but this makes me appreciate them even more.  If you are a record hobbyist, cultist, a non mudhoney fan, watch this.  10/10.

Kudos to the director.  Well Done.",1408838400,,242,4.780487804878049
5451287,4,B00AMHFN3U,"Informative doc on a band that is often overlooked and underappreciated when it comes to bands representative of the ""Seattle Scene."" People in the know are aware of Mark Arm & Co. and their contributions of the late 80's into the 90's, but to the broader audiences, life never went past Nirvana, Pearl Jam & Alice. While I wasn't the biggest fan, I was always interested in what this band was putting out.",1405987200,,406,4.575342465753424
5451288,5,B00AMHFN3U,I have loved Mudhoney for a long time so any kind of interview and documentation of live performance. Is great for me!,1405728000,,118,4.409090909090909
5451289,4,B00AMHFN3U,"Fairly insightful into a band that, like the Replacements, didn't quite play it straight to get rich and famous.  Interesting to see how they managed to held onto their identity and ingetrity(?) when anyone with a Pacific Northwest zip code were co opted into fashionable grunge scene",1402099200,,284,5.042553191489362
5451290,5,B00AMHFN3U,"My husband is a total Mudhoney junkie. He loved this DVD. I like Mudhoney OK, nowhere near as much as he does, and I found it to be a very interesting video.",1394064000,,157,3.9375
5451291,5,B00AMHFN3U,"For any Mudhoney fan, or any fan of real, honest music, this is a must watch.  This is one band who has stayed true to who they are since they started, and you can hear that from the earliest clips in this film all the way to the clips of music from the last album released before this film was put together.

True artists, and true punk rock.",1393027200,,343,4.029411764705882
5451292,5,B00AMHFN3U,"Good interviews with the band past and present. Enjoyed commentary from Kim and Thurston Moore, Jeff Ament, Kim Thayil, Tad Doyle and Bruce Pavitt",1390867200,,146,5.125
5451293,5,B00AMHFN3U,"Mudhoney is a great band. This film is  very well-made, tons of great interviews, rare footage and more. I recommend this documentary to any musician, music fan or documentary fan. Mudhoney is one of those bands that when people love them this way, talk about them this way, describe them as legendary it usually means they're long-broken up and members dead. But thankfully you can still go see Mudhoney. I not only recommend this documentary but I recommend going to see these guys while they're still here. I've seen them dozens of times since the early '90s and they're as awesome live today as they were back then. Amazing documentary!!! Well worth it!!!",1390176000,,659,4.831858407079646
5451294,5,B00AMHFN3U,"If you are a Mudhoney fan this is an interesting and detailed account of the bands history. Good watch, good documentary",1383436800,,120,4.761904761904762
5451295,4,B00AMHFN3U,"I love rock and punk documentaries, so I gave this one a go. To be honest I didn't really like Mudhoney all that much back in the day. I only started to dig their music a couple years ago, and this documentary really helped to confirm perhaps that I had missed Mudhoney's point the first time around. As another reviewer points out, the documentary does begin by almost oddly deifying the band, but then the film reveals itself to be as tongue in cheek and self-confidently flippant as the band itself is. Both Mudhoney and this film are ultimately fueled by humor, cynical takes on music biz and pop culture, an emphasis on self-amusement, and a love for raucous guitar-based rock and roll parody and excess. Now I think I get it, and the music Mudhoney creates makes far more sense to me than it did. Four stars only because after the film was over I wanted to see some of the recent live performances used in the movie in full in the special features, and I would have personally loved a section on the guitars, gear and equipment that the band uses to create such a glorious racket.",1375833600,,1086,4.4623115577889445
5451296,5,B00AMHFN3U,Any story about my favorite band is a good one!  It's good to see Matt is still Matt even if he isn't drunk on stage.,1375660800,,117,3.68
5451297,4,B00AMHFN3U,"I thought there was plenty of insight as to the band members and what occurred with Sub Pop records. I enjoyed it because I'm from L.A. and I appreciate understanding the Seattle scene. It seems L.A. has forgotten what music is. I used to provide technical sound for underground clubs many years ago, but the L.A. scene just seems so insignificant now. Good on the bands like Mudhoney, Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden, The Melvins, Pixies, Sonic Youth. I wish there was an emerging scene that made music exciting again. If you listen to KEXP Seattle radio, there's some interesting stuff. Maybe I'm just not 18 anymore.",1375056000,2,618,4.785046728971962
5451298,5,B00AMHFN3U,"Hey, just because I created this movie doesn't mean I can't review it!

It was such an amazing experience making this documentary.  From traveling to Japan, Europe and across the USA for tour footage and interviews, each experience was a great marker in my life story.

Sit back and enjoy the story of one of the few remaining and truly great bands that has ever existed!

5451299,5,B00AMHFN3U,"I really liked this, being a long time Mudhoney fan.  I was worried at first because the documentary starts out really unfocused and is just a bunch of hero worship (Mudhoney are gods! When they go to the bathroom they leave behind a toilet full of rainbows!) but the film starts to get itself together and tell the story of Mudhoney around 10 minutes into it. The story of Mudhoney is an interesting one and you get to know they guys in the band and the history of the band.  There is also some great extras on the DVD in the form of some cool live footage of the guys rocking out! A must have for any Mudhoney fan, and you're probably a Mudhoney fan if you are reading this. Buy it!",1365379200,4,684,4.174242424242424
5451300,5,B00AMHFN3U,"Run don't walk to see that Mudhoney documentary. Totally kick ass from start to finish. Great interviews with the band that makes them seem like smart, good natured friends who love each other and make great music. The only darkness is when they left Sub Pop for a major label and Mark Arm's relatively non-traumatic dope habit that lasted a few years. Also lots of interviews with all sorts of other musicians and record label folks to flesh the whole story out.",1364688000,,463,4.658536585365853
5451301,5,B00AMHFN3U,"I bought this for my husband, and reluctantly agreed to watch it with him. I'm not into music that's even remotely close to ""grunge"". But I actually really enjoyed watching this. He loved it too.",1363824000,4,195,4.6

8553794,3,B00AMHFN3U,"**Review originally appeared at https://midnighttosix.wordpress.com

The market for niche music product must be bigger than I thought. How else do you explain the recent flood of biographical DVDs from cult acts like The Circle Jerks, The Monks, Big Star, Rodriguez, and Mudhoney? As a fan of these and other under-appreciated bands, its great to see their stories getting the treatment usually reserved for mega-successful acts, but in the case of Mudhoney: Im Now both the story and the way its told are a little too familiar. Co-Directors Ryan Short and Adam Pease are clearly big fans of the band, but the combination of talking head interviews and archival footage has been done a million times before, so even someone as entertaining as Keith Morris (Black Flag/Circle Jerks/OFF!) or Thurston and Kim from Sonic Youth show up to praise Mudhoney its more expected than exciting, thanks to their appearance in so many other DVDs chronicling underground music. How cliche has this Behind The Music-style form of storytelling become? So cliche that when Mark Arm discusses his drug addiction he mentions all the cliche ways in which drug addiction is handled in music documentaries. If youve read books like Grunge Is Dead and Everybody Loves Our Town or any of the countless articles written about grunge, then you already know pretty much everything about the band that the movie tells you. The movie also misses a few key detours that might have proved interesting  instead of spending so much time rehashing what everyone already knows about Mudhoney why not spend time talking about their many side-projects, or Mark Arms stint singing with the reunited MC5, or digging a little deeper into their influencesetc. Its shortcomings like these that limit Im Nows appeal to Mudhoney die-hards.",1451433600,,1795,5.122866894197952
