The love & friendship tainted by the need for deception changes everyones life.  Some times all that can be saved in the end is your integrity.

5086142,2,B007HC8DX0,"This film is your typical coming-out narrative.  It reminded me a lot of ""The Lost Language of Cranes"" and ""Making Love.""  But I must point out something.

The main character at one point exclaims, ""I can't be Maori and gay!""  Many gays and lesbians of color feel this way and I understand why the line was important.  However, plenty of books say that Polynesia was not a homophobic region before Western contact.  The Wikipedia entry on gay rights in New Zealand said the pre-contact Maori did not punish same-sex sexual activity.  In Hawaii, it's been written that Kamehameha the Great had female and male lovers.  Polynesia had ""third genders.""  I read one book which said Gaughin painted them in Tahiti.  Some say in Samoa if parents had all sons they could assign one son to be the daughter.  When my very homophobic Black uncle visited Samoa, the locals pointed out a transgender person in the village.  They knew my uncle would be shocked and possibly revolted, but they themselves were not opposed.  Recently, an academic friend said she's met many gay and lesbian Polynesians on her recent trip to Tahiti.

So I encourage all viewers of this to read books and sources that said Polynesia used to be a friendly place for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgenders until Westerners demanded that they be bigoted.",1344297600,7,1324,4.826666666666667
5086143,3,B007HC8DX0,"The production values, beautiful settings, and glimpses into the Maori culture are a real plus in this new film from the director of The Whale Rider. The actors in the film are very attractive and articulate, and there are several stories going on at once in the film. The retirement of the father from a very respected position in business, the interests of both the daughter and son in the family as they grow up within their family, and the dysfunctional marriage of the lead actors, brought on by the husband's struggle with his homosexuality.

When the husband declares to his family that he's gay, most everyone in the family is surprised, shocked, angry, hurt, and generally disgusted by his announcement and have a very hard time dealing with his disclosure. It's difficult to know how his kids feel, because this aspect of the story is not discussed. It would especially have been interesting to see how his teenage son deals with it. He is trying so hard to be the macho kid he is expected to be in the culture, but is still vulnerable enough to be unsure of himself.

While I know this sounds moralistic (judgmental), I think he should have chosen not to disclose his sexual orientation until his children had grown up and were on their own. His parents told him that he was being very selfish with his decision to come out. I agree. A person can lead only so many lifes during a lifetime and he had made a choice that he should have honored. When his kids had grown up and he wanted to divorce, that would have been the time.

The style is the movie is very over dramatic. I understand that they were trying to express through drama, music, distressed looks, the seriousness of the subject. But the movie plays out like an episode of Days of our Lives. It was also difficult to see the lead character as gay. He appeared to be an introverted macho, hetro man with issues, and probably would not be happy as a gay man, anyway.

If the definition of a film is to make you think, not just entertain you, then this film is one to see. It brings up issues of loyalty, culture, identity, love and courage. And while the outcome of the film was not what I would have liked to see, it does make you think about all the issues at hand.",1341187200,,2238,4.437956204379562
5086144,5,B007HC8DX0,"This film is a 'comeing out' story of a married man that shows his progress from a life of desperite missery and lies to one of courage and honesty--and how this is not an easy road to travel.

A small budget film, it is beautifully directed, writen, acted, and filmed. The actors performances so on spot that that you can forget that your watching a 'performance' and start to feel that your watching real events from a fly on the wall perspective.",1340236800,12,449,4.475609756097561
5086145,4,B007HC8DX0,"...Woman's Point of View...and involving much of a woman's sensitivity.

And yet the movie we're given is from a story written by a man, Witi Ihimaera. A man well known for an acclaimed, later literary work (and film), ""The Whale Rider"" (world premiere at the 2002, Toronto International Film Festival). Still, this is an author who seems to possess much of the ""sensitivity"" referred to above. In truth, female touches abound, which should be no surprise inasmuch as this film work was steered by Director Katie Wolfe, aided by the screenplay work of Kate McDermott. So, in essence, this work is almost as much the story of our Gay lead, Kawa's ....Wife....his Mother....his Daughter, as it is of the man, himself.

BUT, woman's point of view or not, the Pain....the Angst....revealed to us in Calvin Tuteao's characterization of Kawa is REAL. For at its heart this is a story of a man from whom much is, and has been, expected by his Maori societal group....and family. We see a Gay man who has, in fact, led a heterosexual married life (with children). Nevertheless, what we are shown in Kawa is a man experiencing a severe case of ""Closetophobia"".....and a near disabling Fear of Disapproval.

Yes, there is a male lover (on the side)....and visits to a bathhouse. BUT for those anticipating finding more than mere hints of Gay romance or Gay love scenes in this work, I must reluctantly say such hopes will be dashed. The emphasis seems to be, instead, upon heterosexual closeness....family closeness. And fear of loss of the latter.

Oh, there is a ""final stand"" taken against family...and society, and that is effectively conveyed to we viewers. But I will reveal nothing more about this film's closing storyline. I can say, however, that production values were unexpectedly high, from this film goer's point of view. And gorgeous New Zealand scenery doesn't hurt at all (rating credit was given for all this).

I have yet to decide whether to keep this video in my Gay Film Library.",1338940800,5,1990,4.8584070796460175

Nothing out of the ordinary there.  The only thing that gives this story any additional appeal is the New Zealand setting and the chance to get brief glimpses into the traditional Maori culture.

The locale is beautiful, and the glimpses of Maori culture are made accessible by characters who seem to invite the viewer into the family.  The movie is not just about the main character, Kawa, but about all his family members, friends, and even co-workers.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1400284800,,520,5.240963855421687
5086158,5,B007HC8DX0,"An exceptionally well done film addressing the added complexity and difficulty which cultural norms can place on the progressive process of the healthy evolution and acceptance of a mans sexual preference. The pressures for conformity to a norm of each divergent culture around the world are distinctly unique and this film is a microcosmic look within a culture whose nuances are lesser known to the average viewer and that is one of the points which makes this film well worth the viewing. The issues are unfolded and presented with honesty, respect and lack of clich for all of the complexities and difficulties these unique New Zealand cultural norms place not only on the protagonist KAWA but on ALL of the important lives of those who surround him. The story line is cohesively presented with skill by all of the actors involved and the production values are exceptional.",1400198400,,877,4.9727891156462585

5086164,5,B007HC8DX0,"I still can't get over what a 'find' this film was.  I've never been to New Zealand, and the beautiful cities and seascapes alone were enough to give this film five stars!  The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.  The movie challenged it's viewers to think about life choices, desires, and the realtiies of following your heart.",1391385600,7,923,4.6770186335403725
5086165,5,B007HC8DX0,"Kawa's predicament is something not as uncommon as ""moralists"" think.  People try so hard to live up to the expectations of their society, but quite often they struggle with being true to themselves.

5086166,3,B007HC8DX0,"Despite the display of indigenous ceremonial customs in the film, Kawa presents a generic,trite, and pat treatment of homosexuality in New Zealand.  This easily could have been your standard cable issue of the week movie...you know the type where the husband leads a secret life.  The elements were there...the comfortable well appointed house, the beautiful and upscale locale,  the well to do profession of the husband, the dim-witted doormat of a wife, the secret lover who threatens the husband with exposure.  Again, despite the references to Maori culture, Kawa could have been set in any generic city in the USA.  If the film had been specific to Maori and/or New Zealand culture, it would have been much better.  Eyes Wide Open is a film that eschews generic themes and depicts homosexuality in a culturally specific and authentic manner.",1388793600,,846,5.094202898550725
5086167,4,B007HC8DX0,"I enjoyed learning a little something about the Maori people and their traditions. I hadn't ever even heard of them before watching this movie. The acting was top-notch, and the storyline kept me interested all the way through. This ""gay themed"" movie was done tastefully, like Brokeback Mountain, in that gratuitous sex-scenes were not shown. The cinematography was noticeably very good as well. I liked Kawa and recommend it highly. Definitely worth watching.",1387756800,,461,5.328767123287672

5086171,5,B007HC8DX0,"Kawa is not unlike many late-in-life coming out stories of men with wives and children. The story is however, immersed in cultural tradition which lends a unique slant of rich and storied tradition that other tales tend to omit. I especially like the admissions by the central character of the pressures young gay men of a certain era must have faced. It is true that this story does not flesh out the typical Hollywood ending, the happily ever after, but telling that kind of drama really misses the point. Permitting real love, time can ease pain. Each character must allow the time to understand a truth that the protagonist has lived with for many years.

Do not shy away from Kawa. Without pain no relationship may grow, and in this story's plot we all are reminded that the passage of time is necessary for all to resolve new futures. The sadness here is comfortable, realistic, yet bearable.

The lush backdrop serves Kawa well. It's production values, attention to detail, and direction underscore a truly well crafted film. It does not share the fate of most low budget films, and the acting, each line reading, is top notch. Well worth the watch.",1386374400,,1156,4.746268656716418
5086172,4,B007HC8DX0,I thought it was a tender story with a sensitive subject and well portrayed by the actors.  A quality movie.,1386374400,,108,4.4
5086173,4,B007HC8DX0,"I really enjoyed this movie and might give it the fifth final star to close it out.  Being a gay Maori woman myself, I know the pressure the character Kawa goes through.  What is unbelievable though, is his success (especially with his heavy distractions) and the latent consumerism that is displayed across the movie.

Kawa doesn't have to be a rich Maori to be believable, because, sadly, it's not that believable.  Why does he have to be wealthy to be adored?  I think making him poorer or his family less ""Americanized"" will make this movie have the final chops it needs to be excellent.

The pain he goes through and the self-doubt of burying his feelings for the greater good of his family is extremely palpable, as is his relationship with his sweetheart of a little daughter.  His boyfriend and the rest of the movie are completely NZ-made to a tee and I enjoyed revisiting that part of NZ as I watched this movie progress.  Very good.  I recommend it!",1386201600,,960,4.6

5086175,4,B007HC8DX0,I found the beginning of the film to be somewhat slow. This is where the personal battle with homosexuality is still being fought by Kawa. The outcome and the reality of the outcome is well worth the slower start.,1382918400,,213,4.487179487179487
5086176,3,B007HC8DX0,"The film is of fine quality production values and talent all around. Kawa is a Maori man struggling with his decision to come out. He has a family he loves and a beautiful white boyfriend on the side. Otherwise he's a devoted family man but is unable to ignore his desires. He loves his family too much to leave them. He also has struggles with the power of his strong influential parents and his place as family heir. The story is that Kawa has lived a lie his whole life but has built a happy life regardless. Now he's confronted with the need to be his true self at the peril of his familial relationships and cultural ties.
The film introduces interesting themes but handles the storytelling a bit matter of factly. My emotional investment was held at bay, perhaps by a slow pace, obvious dialogue and handling of the conflicts. However, overall I enjoyed the film.",1380758400,,869,4.54140127388535

5086182,2,B007HC8DX0,"I'm genuinely glad there are niche movies like Kawa for the people who need them, gay men from profoundly gay-hostile, tradition- and family-worshiping cultures. But all this movie does for me is make me extremely grateful that my own background is northern European, where the individual is more important than the family, the object of child-rearing is independence from the parents, not bondage to them forever, and men are not expected to stomp, thump their chests, and grunt in unison at birthday parties.

This movie is even more alien to me than a heterosexual romance. I found the melodrama unbearably tedious and the behavior of every person in the movie preposterous. I'm glad it's here for the men who can identify with it and be encouraged by it, but I'm not one of them.",1368057600,,783,4.843283582089552

I tend not to re-write the film summary in my reviews, because that can readily be viewed.

There's little to smile about in this tragic film of a family and an individual (Kawa) broken apart by his coming to terms with his sexuality. The story is moving, the cast strong, the acting and direction all very good to excellent.  The emotional family scene towards the end was a bit stretched in my mind, and really the key difference between 4 and 5 stars.

The scenery and landscapes are breath-taking - and the colorful cinematic effects also reminded me of Far From Heaven which employed a kaleidoscope of brilliant colors.  If you looking for a heavy film about family and coming out at a late age in life, I definitely recommend Kawa (and the accompanying soundtrack).",1359244800,,1003,5.487012987012987

Not that different from other movies we have seen when an older man with wife and children fully realize that he was always gay form childhood but did not know how to express until later in life. There was not enough to the script or romane between him and the younger guy and nothing really juicy or interesting romance wise. Basically nothing memorable to talk about after seeing it.

8516640,5,B007HC8DX0,"Strongly acted, complex, resonant, and at times deeply moving, Kawa is one of the best movies of what has become, surprisingly perhaps, a now familiar genre in film and fiction, the coming out of a middle aged married man.  Occasionally, it veers toward melodrama (weeping, angry recriminations, emotional explosions), but the film never veers into excess or unbelievability; each extreme moment is justified by genuine feeling.
In essence, Kawa is the story of the conflict within a man between the tradition to which he belongs and his need to be himself.

It is one of the oldest stories in the world, almost mythic in its implications, the struggle within a man between the world into which he is born and the new world he wishes to find on his own, here made ""new,"" in a sense, by the fact that the central character is gay.  What is striking about it is that the traditional world and its values are never caricatured or mocked or reduced.  They are presented with the respect and honor that is due them.

Yet they are nonetheless to Kawa, as to others, also repressive.  The struggle he confronts is real, deep, and meaningful.  The movie is all the more powerful because of that.",1468540800,,1187,4.705314009661835

8516643,4,B007HC8DX0,"Kawa is a highly successful New Zealand businessman with a pretty wife, a handsome son, who is training as a competitive swimmer, and an adorable daughter.  He lives in a prosperous New Zealand world in which Maori and British New Zealanders interact and intermarry, and enjoy both cultures.  He would seem to have it all, but he has a secret.

Based on the novel ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain"" by renowned Maori writer Witi Ihimaera, the story of Kawa and his extended family are brought to the screen in this film.  Calvin Tutearo brings Kawa to life, showing the conflict he is experiencing and the consequences of his choices on himself and others.  Nathalie Bolt evokes our sympathy as his wife who has done no wrong, and Vicki Haughton as his mother plays a Dragon Lady par excellence.  George Henare is his father and patriarch of the clan, and Pana Hema-Taylor is his hunky son.  (Hema-Taylor is known for his role on the TV show ""Spartacus."")

One thing that this move does well is to show the lives of middle-class New Zealanders that get up and go to work every day and have normal lives.  They live in nice homes and are surrounded by the natural beauty of New Zealand.  'Tis refreshing to see Maoris portrayed who are not experiencing all sorts of social problems and with whom many modern Maoris today can certainly relate.  What confronts Kawa and those around him are the realities that can afflict anyone.  In his case, though the world may be changing for the young, it is changing more slowly for those who are older with established lives.

The DVD opens with a public service announcement about how important it is to gay cinema that its followers not download movies illegally or acquire pirated copies.  That is a lesson that those who support gay movies should heed.

There are a series of trailers from Wolfe films included on the DVD: ""Leave it on the Floor,"" ""August,"" ""Suicide Room,"" ""Private Romeo,"" ""What Happens Next,"" "" Mangus,"" ""Kick Off,"" ""Judas Kiss,"" ""The Green"" and ""Undertow.""

Also, there's something about the movie that just didn't seem believable.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it's almost as if this movie was created specifically for a 40-something, European white-collar gay male audience.  And that's ok too...I guess know how manipulative and flat out deceptive cover art can be, didn' associate homosexuality with a man touching another man's chest, 'cause that's all you get.  Maybe it's a cultural thing.  UPDATE: At some time after my original review, the film description was updated to reflect that it is about a homosexual couple, though they really didn't seem that gay to me.  There was nothing about the movie that seemed particularly gay.",1419984000,,885,4.98639455782313
8516645,4,B007HC8DX0,"Love this movie, I believe this was tastefully done. Director didn't expose every detail, it was left to the imagination. I love the story being told, the double life and what follows it. Good acting, wasn't formula with the cast. But the pulled it off. I'd purchase this one.",1410652800,,276,4.653061224489796
