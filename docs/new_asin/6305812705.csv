1078284,1,6305812705,"Marty Beck is a ""master horror writer"" who decides to lease a haunted house in which to write his newest novel.  Although he doesn't believe in ghosts, he hopes the atmosphere will rub off on his writing.  The only frightening thing about this movie is that the  ""filmmakers"" actually got the money to do it.  The community  theater acting, terrible script, lifeless directing, and cheesy special  effects (just love the opening suicide where the woman blows her oatmeal... I  mean, her brains against the window) scream for Mystery Science Theater  treatment.  While I strongly support independent films and understand the  endless obstacles one confronts trying to make one, a dog is still a dog.  Don't waste your time or money on this.",959558400,5,739,4.975409836065574
7895359,1,6305812705,"This movie was so horrible I don't even remember what it was about, except that it truly sucked.  Before I bought this movie I failed to check out who this movie was made by:  BRAIN DAMAGE.  Any Brain Damage movie will suck, so beware, however.... I did sort of enjoy ""Hell's Highway"".  It kept my interest and was very gory.  But that's about the only Brain Damage movie that I've like so far.",1135814400,,394,4.342465753424658
7895360,3,6305812705,"I've spent 3 decades as an avid horror film buff, and I've noticed something about the actors. Do you remember anything about the actors in the horror movies of the 80's, 90's or the millennium? They don't really hold your attention.

But the actors of those old Hammer Studio films and others sure grab your attention! Who can forget Peter Cushing and Lilli Palmer's cheekbones! Or Christopher Lee's mad scientist hairline. Or even Jack Palance playing a vampire and looking ten times as frightening than Gary Oldman ever did as Dracula! And all Jack had was a cape, fangs and some contact lenses!

Sure, this movie is an okay B-movie, but damn those actors are creepy! I get the impression that those British actors of the 60's and 70's the horror genre, were really classically trained Shakespearean actors cooling their heels until the Old Vic Theater summoned them.",1114300800,,870,4.871621621621622
7895361,1,6305812705,Only fun to watch with others.  If you want a good laugh I highly recommend it.  Though I rate the item as a one star movie it is a five star experience.,1106092800,,153,3.75
7895362,1,6305812705,"Yet another tiresome and tedious movie from the Polonia Brothers.  From reading other reviews I can only gather that the only time anyone buys this piece of cinematic crap is by accident.  The one or two of you out there that actually like this movie should be hospitalized and confined in a rubber room.  I would suggest a lobotomy but there can't be much left to take, no offense.

All in all it was a terible movie and I myself want to commit suicide for having watched this movie.  Luckily I only rented it.",1095379200,2,511,4.3936170212765955
7895363,1,6305812705,"I regret buying this movie....... It was boring.
I fell asleep 10 times before I even finished
watching it. I think it took a month to actually
see the whole movie. I had to give this a 1 star
for having the guts to put it out for sale.",1074988800,4,236,3.836734693877551
7895364,1,6305812705,"this was a terrible movie, especially when i expected to get the 1970 dubbed version of this movie.  make sure you know what you're getting! this was a bore!",1053820800,5,157,4.413793103448276
7895365,2,6305812705,"well what do you expect from sub rosa productions?  not much at all thats for sure.  and is the green creature thats on the side of the DVD cover and on the DVD actually in the movie?  that would be a big NO.  decent watch and nothing more, actually better than most b-movies but nothing entirely special, did have great sound.  but if your expecting a great haunted house flick then you will be mildly disappointed.",1050192000,5,416,4.421052631578948
7895366,3,6305812705,"Be sure you contact the sellers or Amazon before buying this, because the title is The House that Screamed, but the other reviews are all for The House that Screamed 2.  The House that Screamed (aka The Finishing School) is the American, dubbed version of the Spanish horror movie, La Residencia.  It's pretty good--definately scared me when I was a little kid.  That 1969 movie probably influenced Dario Argento when he made Suspiria, and it was also the basis for the slasher Pieces.
I've heard that The House that Screamed 2 is awful, so just be sure you know which one you're getting.",1033171200,5,588,4.689320388349515
7895367,1,6305812705,"If I've ever wanted to curse in a review this would be the time.  I appriciate that these people are not masters of their craft, but I know two year olds that produce scary stuff then this.  This movie had no merits to its name other than the box that the movie came in.  The box was cool.  The acting was horrible.  When I mean horrible, I'm not using a strong enough word.  One review described it as community theater acting.  I think that is a bad insult to community theaters everywhere and the reviewer should get down on his knees and beg forgivness from anyone who has ever acted in a community theater.  Between each peace of dialoge there is a pause.  It is then followed by a highly faked outburst of emotion.  And don't forget the ""no!"" let out by the lead actor as he was crying in a scene that I never actually was sure when it happened.  Only one move came close to being as horrible as this one in my opinion.  That was ""The Legend of the Chupacabra.""",1017014400,3,967,4.224043715846994
