8148274,1,B000J0QP8W,Well the order came but we could not watch it because it was on a VHS and we thought it would come as a DVD. Do people have VHS players anymore? Disappointed.,1396224000,,158,3.96875
8148275,5,B000J0QP8W,"'Far Out Space Nuts' was great Sat.morning fun. Bob Denver and Chuck McCann were great at ad libbing jokes. There are familiar guest Stars that appeared on the episodes as well which helped create character. Some may say this is 'Gilligans Island' in Space, but I say it's own vehicle that stands on it's own. It was a nice NASA tribute in my humble opinion as the era of Skylab was around..True, Far Out Space Nuts may not have ran as long as some shows however, it's not because it wasn't good, indeed it was great escapism to watch. I remember this show after all these years while others are totally forgettable.",1380326400,4,616,4.508928571428571
