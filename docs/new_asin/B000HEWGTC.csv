8139262,4,B000HEWGTC,"Bangkok's a little slow, but not bad, maybe 3 stars.
Omen is the better of the 2 -- I give it 4 stars.  Interesting movie.",1241136000,,122,3.88
8139263,2,B000HEWGTC,"Contrary to the hype on the packaging, there isn't much Pang in these ""Pang Brothers"" discs.  If you're expecting to get 3 hours of the same quality and frights as you would from a viewing of ""The Eye"", then move on.

""The Omen"" was written by a Pang, but directed and edited by someone completely different.  ""Bangkok Haunted"" is a three-story anthology, only one of which is directed by Oxide Pang... which is good. But that's all the Pang this 2-movie ""Pang Brothers"" really only has to offer.",1183766400,,496,4.613636363636363
