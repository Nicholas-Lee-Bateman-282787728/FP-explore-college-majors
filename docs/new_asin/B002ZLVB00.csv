8594409,5,B002ZLVB00,"This DVD is simply amazing. Let me begin by stating how great the vendors are. They had open communication with me throughout the whole process and are very kind. This DVD was created in a professional way and features some of the most beautiful scenes from Puerto Rico. If you have never visited the island and would like to see some of the most wonderful places to go, I suggest you pick up this DVD and believe me after watching this there is no way you are not going to want to go to Puerto Rico. The only minor con is that the images are so beautiful that you want to see it in HD instead of the Widescreen SD it comes in. Not really a fault of the vendors or creators they worked with what they had. It's amazing to me that someone actually took the time to go find these beautiful areas and record them so that we all can enjoy it as well. In my opinion, worth every penny I spent on it.",1329264000,4,894,4.0852272727272725
