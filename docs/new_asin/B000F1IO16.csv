2548328,4,B000F1IO16,"I really enjoyed this movie. It gives hope to those who thinks that once a person strays from church and its upbringing, that there is no hope. I would recommend this movie to everybody. Good Movie!",1152748800,3,198,4.527777777777778
2548329,4,B000F1IO16,This movie was very entertaining.  It had several messages which proved to be both interesting and helpful.  It is also a powerful story which depicts how things have a way of coming together when we work as a team in spite of our differences.  I'm sure I will be showing this over and over again with my family and friends.,1151625600,6,324,4.366666666666666

2548331,4,B000F1IO16,"If you liked The Gospel then you will probably like this movie also! The two movies are almost identical there are very few differences. But, I still think it is a very good movie!",1150070400,6,180,4.323529411764706
2548332,4,B000F1IO16,This is a really nice family film that delivers a great message.  Great New York setting with some solid performances from some established actors (Eartha Kitt) as well as some fresh new faces. All set to a great hip hop / gospel sound track.,1150070400,3,242,4.5
2548363,5,B000F1IO16,"Enjoyable for entainment, excellent acting, sound tract, picture quality and story content. True to life. Depicts hope, love, encouragement, family, and humor.",1189641600,,159,6.2727272727272725
2548364,5,B000F1IO16,"I loved it. It points out how two people closely related can process the same tragic event in their mind and heart and react to it differently.

I cannot say enough about these brothers and the beautiful relationship that continued non stop  with their aunt. The level of respect they had for her was wonderful to see. She spoke they listened.

I thought both brothers had so much to offer others. They were different in so many ways yet so much alike. I was glued to my television as I watched the drama unfold.

I cannot say enough about Eartha Kitt whom I adore. I loved the musical selections as well. There was one scene of the brothers in church talking. I must have watched that at least 50 times and laughed every time I viewed it.",1178668800,,739,4.372262773722627
2548365,3,B000F1IO16,"I purchased this movie thinking that it going to be similar to the recent film, ""The Gospel"".  The only thing that was remotely similar was the remote references to Gospel music and the storyline.

The movie had potential but the language made it almost unwatchable.  By positioning it as a story similar to ""The Gospel"" the same sort of crowd was attracted--church people--and the profanity was a definite turnoff.  The funny thing is that the profanity did not advance the story, it felt thrown in.

Also, the movie did not know if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama or both, the comedic edges were uneven but the tension in the drama was done pretty well.",1168560000,7,659,4.5508474576271185
2548366,1,B000F1IO16,"There is nothing to review because since I bought this item on September 27th 2006, I have not received it. Please if you are unable to deliver what I purchased, bring my money back.

2548367,3,B000F1IO16,"This movie doesn't know whether it wants to be a Christian movie or secular movie.  From just looking at the cover, I thought I was getting a nice Christian movie, but the amount of profanity and sexual innuendo made it clear to me that I was mistaken.  That having been said, the movie was still pretty good.  I don't see how a movie like this can make any money though.  The Christian theme would offend the sinners and the cursing and sex talk would offend the Christians - especially the deep ones.  If this movie is trying to pass as a Christian movie, it failed the test.  It does have a happy ending but the movie has no real redeeming value.  It doesn't attempt to present the Gospel message in any way shape or form.  If you're looking for a pure Christian movie, maybe you should skip this one, but if you want to be entertained and don't mind a few curse words here and there, this would be a pretty good one to watch.",1166486400,5,929,4.268571428571429
2548368,1,B000F1IO16,"This movie was disappointing to born again believers. I would like to disagree with all of the ones that stated this is it good for the family to watch. Using profanity, inwhich this movie uses is not good for the family.  The plot was hard to follow.  Too many things pointing to sex: Eartha Kitt showing her legs in the choir, Tichina act with the microphone(showing her thighs, putting  mic between her legs, working for the pastor in that type of attire, Zulu talks of meeting Eartha to have sex after choir rehearsal). Young boys coming in the church bouncing a basketball-Straight disrepect to the church. This doesn't leads anyone to repentance but accepting people in the church-No type of foundation. This movie shows profit gain in this world-Zulu working it out Bul to make more money-What about God.  Where is Jesus in this. If this is the church then we need to start over because this is not working. God help us all. Please in urgency self-examine yourself!! DISAPPOINTMENT",1164412800,10,988,4.794117647058823
2548369,5,B000F1IO16,This was an excellent entertaining video.  My kids just loved it!,1162598400,,65,4.909090909090909
2548370,5,B000F1IO16,This is a great Christian  movie  about twins brothers who have taken different path in life. One becomes a minister and the other hip-hop rapper. They are forced into reconciliation after years of being separated from one another. This is a movie you want to have in your collection and enjoy with your family.,1155859200,5,311,4.7407407407407405
2548371,5,B000F1IO16,"This movie shows how different sibblings are even if they are twin boys! Teshawn sneaked off and saw their father shot and killed by the husband of the woman he was cheating on his wife with.  Shortly after, his mother died of a broken heart.  Their aunt comes to their mothers' funeral and take them back to Harlen.

Wesley did everything he felt was right and desires to be a minister; but Teshawn took a different path.  Teshawn began to not care about anything. Each brother took a different path in life. Wes (Darien Sills-Evans) became a minister in the Harlem gospel church their aunt took them to; while Te (Billoah Greene) perpetrates the gangster lifestyle he raps about as a Hip Hop star -- Zulu.

Wes denies that he knows Zulu to local kids who look up to him, but they are forced into reconciliation when Te flees from La La Land to his childhood home in Harlem to hide from his enraged record producer Bull Sharky played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Wes does not welcome Te home but his fiance, aunt and all of the church people do!  Te takes over the choir and all of the local kids join the choir.  Te decides to enter the choir in a local contest that they always won when he was at home.  They lose the contest, but decide to make a gospel record.

Bull Sharky catches up to Te and his friend who helped him steal his record masters back, they want to hurt him, but he conveniences them that he is going legit and makes a gospel record to make the producer more money.

Te and Wes must face a harsh reality, we are different but the same.  I enjoyed this movie.",1153872000,4,1579,4.354948805460751
2548372,2,B000F1IO16,"I was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between ""The Gospel"" and ""The Fighting Temptations"".  I would not recommend purchasing.  You are better off renting.",1153872000,5,200,5.03030303030303

8116478,5,B000F1IO16,I love this movie!  It's a great feel-good exploration of the classic struggle with good child/bad child.  I adore Charles Randolph Wright's work and hope that his musical Blue will someday be made into a movie.,1415145600,,211,4.833333333333333
8116479,4,B000F1IO16,"sadly it did have some curse words that did not need to be on this project, but actors Novella Nelson (aunt June) and cast made up for it other wise.  Patti Labelle did well, but I wish they'd make her part a little longer.",1355702400,,223,4.068181818181818

8116482,3,B000F1IO16,"This is NOT a family movie unless your family is over the age of 18. It has profanity, sexual innuendos, and while it is set in a church, it is not a church based movie. As it says in the rating of PG 13, it is rated that way for Language, Sex, and Drug references.

I would define this movie in two ways:
First, it is a movie about community and a willingness to work towards a common goal.
Second, it is a movie about the past and about misunderstandings.

I enjoyed the movie because of the second theme, but I only give it a limited endorsement because of the content.",1330300800,,572,4.1441441441441444
8116483,3,B000F1IO16,"I gave this to my mother-in-law who is very spirit-filled and loves movies about the church. However, she was underwhelmed with the story and production value; she felt it ""needed something"".",1196640000,,191,5.193548387096774
