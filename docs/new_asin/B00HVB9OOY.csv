8636339,4,B00HVB9OOY,"Comments for the 2-DVD set. I am waiting for Blu-ray in the US: at least, first disk - ""Great Bear Stakeout"" was issued on Blu-ray in UK (104 minutes) - see amazon.co.uk.

DVD features: 220 minutes total, episode selection, English & French subtitles in all 3 episodes, but no scene selection (though you can skip through scenes) and no extras.

My overall rating for this 2-DVD set is 4 of 5, could be produced better, though camera work is exceptional.

Disk 2 (old movies):

1) ""Polar Bear Battlefield"" (2003)  is narrated by Sanjeev Bhaskar. 49 minutes.
Great shots of hunting Polar Bears, some probably not seen before, even rare big groups of bears, though a little too much computer animation/graphics, sometimes intrusive a little bit.
My rating: 4 of 5.
Picture quality could be better, looks like a DVD transfer problem, not the film's producers.

2) ""Bears - Spy in the Woods"" (2004) is narrated by David Attenborough. 52 minutes.
Cool movie and music score :), fun to watch, funny close-ups with hidden cameras. Wild bears around the globe: Polar, Brown, Black, South American spectacled bear and Giant Panda.
My rating: 5 of 5 - the best!
I want it on Blu-ray!

Disk 1 (newer movie):

""Great Bear Stakeout""  (first aired on BBC TV, April 2013) is narrated by Billy Connolly.
2 parts, 59 minutes each.
Video footage made by two BBC groups in 2012, in 3 locations in Katmai National Park, Alaska. First location, most parts of the whole movie shot in remote area of Wide Bay, following selected bears for 5 months + 30 miles away second location (scenes for several minutes). Great story, amazing footage - THANKS!
Third location, the second BBC team, at very popular Brooks Falls, only 10 minutes footage left in the film (part #2, scenes 5 & 6), it's a different story which should be separated into a stand-alone episode with more footage time, in my opinion...

On TV, Discovery Channel and Animal Planet rarely broadcast High Definition version of ""Great Bear Stakeout"", 2 hours with commercials,  TV version looks incomplete but with better resolution.

My rating for this episode: 4 of 5,
awesome movie!, but BBC editors didn't meet completely my high expectations for Brooks Falls video. For several days I saw in person many scenes and all bears (including 3 cubs) shown for those 10 minutes, unfortunately many interesting things left behind by BBC producers... Anyway, thanks a lot to 7 BBC guys on the Brooks Falls site - they worked hard in July 2012.

Speaking of Brooks, anybody can travel there and safely see many unforgettable  scenes by themselves from the platform (where some BBC cameras were mounted) with naked eye just a few yards away from bears at the waterfall, as many people from around the Globe do. Just take into account, Salmon doesn't jump over the falls like crazy every day even during July run, sometimes bears staying in the water for hours with no success. The Brooks Camp area is probably the most popular brown bear safari in the world, a relatively easy access (by air), amazing and beautiful scenery, safe. Never been hunted bears got used to hundreds of different people so close to them every day, like to local mosquitoes or flies, unavoidable annoyance, though people yield to bears by Katmai NP rules. Many popular professional photos with a salmon jumping into a bear open mouth made from the same platform where BBC cameras were setup. Once I counted about 50 people (many with huge photo lenses and tripods) on that 2-level narrow deck, with more than a dozen bears in front of us. It's a big natural show, live, no made-ups.",1407888000,4,3587,4.792544570502431
8636340,5,B00HVB9OOY,"THREE full bear episodes! ""Bear: Spy In The Den"" is best.",1405382400,,57,4.2727272727272725
