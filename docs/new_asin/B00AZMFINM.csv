5531191,1,B00AZMFINM,"CRAP! Hey, I got an idea! Let us get a whole bunch of ethnic ""actors""/""comedians"" together and make fun of movies like we do when we are in the theaters!! Plain Stupid. There was one that was somewhat funny, it was called Scary Movie. Everything after that was not funny and either is this piece of garbage. Marlon Wayans and Cedric ""The Entertainer""...enough said.",1363996800,5,365,4.71875
5531192,3,B00AZMFINM,"I wasn't expecting too much from a movie like this one. You already have an idea of parodies being annoyingly stupid, but people still goes to the movie theater and they watch them, but ""A Haunted House"" is actually funny. The movie follows the structure of the Paranormal Activity movies, but it's a funny parody (the Wayans say it's not exactly a parody). You'll also see parodies of recent exorcism movies like The Last Exorcism or The Devil Inside. The only thing I didn't liked were the sexual jokes; I think they are okay, but not every five minutes, because it gets old really fast and even disgusting at times. I would recommend the movie to people who likes parodies like Scary Movie or Disaster Movie, and even Paranormal Activity fans. You will have a good time, but don't expect too much, just the necessary.",1362787200,25,820,4.662068965517242
5531193,3,B00AZMFINM,"""You made a deal with the devil for a pair of shoes? Not shoes Malcolm!!! Louboutins OK, they've got red soles and they make my calves pop. I really needed them OK!"" Malcolm (Wayans) and Kisha (Atkins) have moved in together and are excited to start their new life together. When strange things start to happen they look for answers and narrow it down to one thing. A ghost is messing with them. This is another movie that is pretty much what you would expect. Funnier then the recent Scary Movie movies but after a half hour it seemed to run out of ideas and started to repeat itself. The first half hour was really funny though. The movie spoofs the Paranormal Activity and Last Exorcism movies so if you have seen those this will be funnier. The dialog is funny and this is worth watching but don't expect to laugh all the way through, unless you like the same joke over and over. Overall, very funny for awhile then runs out of steam. I give it a B-.",1362182400,3,954,4.335195530726257
5531194,3,B00AZMFINM,"Yes, this is a dumb movie. Yes, it is raunchy. Yes, there's no good reason for your 15 year old to see it. But for those of maturity (17+) who've seen and liked the Paranormal Activity movies of the past would probably get a kick out of this ""send up"" of those films. Again, it's really, really stupid and at times _wildly_ inappropriate. But it's also very, very funny ;-)",1359936000,5,373,4.3428571428571425
5531195,5,B00AZMFINM,"I must say this movie is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. I literally laughed from beginning to end with almost no time to catch my breath. This is not a family movie so please no one under 18 is advised to watch this. If you are looking for a great laugh and a great time, grab some popcorn and watch this.",1359849600,4,316,3.953125
5531196,4,B00AZMFINM,"This is a very funny African-American spoof of the found footage films. The humor borders on low brow for much of the film. Kisha (Essence Atkins) moves in with Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) and almost immediately claims the house is possessed as she finds her keys on the floor. Malcolm sets up cameras and uses techniques he learned from watching ""Scooby-Doo.""

If you have seen the Paranormal series, you can't help but laugh at this film which includes a gay psychic (Nick Swardson) who is more interested in Malcolm than the ghost; the camera installer (David Koechner) who also is part of ""The Ghost guys""; a priest in training (Cedric the Entertainer) and a couple who want a ""Mandingo Party.""

The humor while crude, I enjoyed, as it wasn't simply crude for crude's sake.

5531317,1,B00AZMFINM,"Let me start by saying that I love the Wayans.  My introduction to them was Damon's stand-up act, followed closely by the FOX series, ""In Living Color.""  It was something I felt comfortable allowing my young children at the time (my baby is 31 - on purpose) to watch with me. Even now when I watch the series in syndication nearly thirty years later, I still need my ""brown pants"" (yes from another loved-hated movie).

When Marlon and Sean launched the ""Scary Movie"" series, I found that I could not in good conscience support their cinematic work with anywhere near the same degree of enthusiasm.

The Wayans family is to comedy what the Winans are to Black Gospel.  They are the reigning family of comedy.  They are masters of the craft.  Whether it is stand-up, parody, slapstick, situational or any other comedic genre they have assailed, I have not failed to experience serial waves of laughter at their portrayals.  ""Scary Movie"" was no exception.  There were moments when I thought my head would burst from the level and series of whole-body laughter.  The same is true of ""A Haunted House"".

The Wayans' cinematic work is unnecessarily excessively vulgar.  As entertaining as their television work has been without the vulgarity, I thought their cinematic work would be no less thoroughly enjoyable.  Yes, I expected more mature comedy than what is played on broadcast television.  Unfortunately, they consistently go way too far out there, and ruin the impact of their comedic genius.

It reminds me of a time when I thanked a funeral director who had prepared a loved one's body for their funeral.  They had done an outstanding job of presenting her in a way that was naturally her appearance without the disfigurement of the cause of death.  Instead of thanking us, and saying something encouraging or about his commitment to giving us the best final memories, he began to describe in ugly detail the process that produced what we saw.  So, every time I think of the funeral, its many memorable reflections by family and friends and the beautiful presentation, I also have to think of the image of the process.

Yes, I belly-laughed throughout ""Haunted"", but they were stifled by the degree to which Cedric, Marlon and the rest of the crew carried the gags.  They went beyond mature or adult comedy into the abyss of vulgar comedic filth.

Anybody remember (still watch) ""Looney Tunes""?  Do you remember (still see) the adult double entendres in the episodes?  These cartoons while designed for family consumption contain(ed) some really adult gags.  They were subtle enough that even if the little kiddies watching caught them, would not offend them, but clear enough that adults got both sides of the gag and enjoyed more than a few laughs themselves.  The same is done in many animated features now.  The most hilarious one I can recall is the late (and great) Robin Williams' work in ""Aladdin"".

The Wayans have already demonstrated that they can produce no less entertaining fare as these and other mature productions, that would have an even greater appeal without the vulgarity.

There was another problem with the film.  Well, it really was not the film as much as it was the audience - two adults in the audience.

Does anyone remember being directed to close their eyes and cover their ears when content far less graphic than this movie appeared on the TV or movie - usually drive-in movie -  screen?

Somewhere around thirty minutes into the film, a couple came in and sat two children next to us.  The boy and girl were no older than  ten years-old at the outside.  My bride and I were on the front row.  The adults disappeared. I could only hope that they were at least in the same theater.

Whatever guilty pleasure we could have prior to this point - and there was a lot - was severely attenuated by their presence. We felt like we would give them the wrong message that this was appropriate behavior by our laughter. Children tend to misperceive adult responses this way.  They misinterpret our laughter as approval.  I started thinking like a parent and spent more time watching their reactions to the mayhem on the screen and wondering how much of it would influence their worldview and behavior in the short and long term, than watching the movie to see if the next funny idea would be just as the last - well thought, but overextended.

The children's presence only accentuated the impact of the vulgarities - especially the ""pulling a train"" scene with Marlon Wayans, Cedric the Entertainer and others with the lead actress.

I wonder if placing these not-even-close-to-pubescent children in the front row alone with this extremely ""adult"" material was deliberate pedophiliac conditioning.  Those thoughts made me even more uncomfortable, because now I wondered if they were in danger and needed help from the local child protection agency.",1463097600,,4873,4.849878934624697

5531532,4,B00AZMFINM,"NOT FOR KIDS!!!

This movie is funny.  I enjoyed it.  The language could have been cleaner, but what do you expect with you get a bunch of black comedians together.  (Please, do not take that comment at racist.  The language was very appropriate for them, but not a white person like me.  If I had said some of their lines in public, I might end up in jail or worse.)  There is some nudity - butts.  I laughed hard when Malcom (Marlon Wayans) had sex with a stuffed animal.  That's right, he literally has sex with a stuffed animal in his bed.  Of course, his boxers were on the whole time, so ladies...you see nothing.  But don't worry you will see his butt later...twice in fact!

Again, parents...do not let your kids watch this movie until you do first.  Language can be sexual at times and foul language is used as well.  Some of the humor is not appropriate for kids either.  Not to mention some scenes may be inappropriate too.  Just watch responsibly and laugh a lot!",1424217600,,975,4.393258426966292

5531664,1,B00AZMFINM,"What can I say about this homage to the possessed house genre? I took a chance on this because ""Scary Movie"" was sort of funny. Well, if you enjoyed ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Exorcist"", you're in for a vulgar trip to the other side. Why does vulgarity equal funny? It doesn't. It shouldn't. But it does. In this case, you have Marlon Wayans having wild monkey love with the stuffed animal of his choice. I was horrified. NOT FUNNY!!! I especially don't recommend viewing this film after you've eaten, or if you're easily offended. This film will offend EVERYBODY. It's chock-full of racist jokes that are more pathetic than amusing. Full of foul descriptions of sex, women, religion, everything that could possibly offend somebody, it's here. It's especially offensive to people who actually work for a living. The maid is fodder for every Mexican joke ever written. Gratuitous nudity abounds as well, mostly Marlon and naked breasts. Numerous sexual situations as well. I understand the satire, but sometimes less is more. I could go on. There were a few genuinely hilarious moments, but they were far and few between.

For my final verdict, I would pass on this if you're easily offended. You might watch if you've had too much to drink. For a truly amusing viewing experience, might I suggest ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil."" It's not as overtly offensive and I actually laughed. Most of all, I didn't feel the need for a shower afterwards!

5531868,2,B00AZMFINM,"Aside from the main couple, all the characters in this film have one joke that they replay over and over.  There's racist guy, dweeb guy, guy who gets off on black men boning his wife, the wife herself getting off on everything, latina housemaid who sees ""el diablo,""  and gay psychic guy.  There are two funny side characters, including Cedric the Entertainer's not very ""Pastorly"" Pastor, and Marlon Wayans' cousin, who says cuz at the end of every sentence (""what happened to your furniture, cuz?"").

Unfortunately, even the main couple gets irritating quickly, as most of their jokes either involve sex with each other or with the ghost or poop.  Both subjects are very funny in small doses, but this movie over-filled its prescription of sex and poop jokes by a lot.  There are some quality dumb jokes that work here and there, but not consistently enough to make this a quality movie.  I will give the movie credit for sticking with the Paranormal Activity parody, instead of other parody films like Disaster Movie which move from Batman to Enchanted without any kind of reason.

Regardless, for good Wayans brothers movies, go with White Chicks, Little Man, Scary Movie, or especially Don't Be a Menace...",1397779200,,1212,4.878048780487805

5531954,3,B00AZMFINM,"The chance to see Marlon Wayans take up the Scary Movie trope up seemed like a money grab at the time.  Even now, it seems to be generally panned, possibly for not being the triumphant, genre starting return fans had hoped for.  However, for the originators of horror parradody, this film takes up were Scary Movie 2 left off in terms of paying homage as much as it jests at the source material it would not exist without.

This is a comedy; this is a parody; there is a pot smoking scene; google mandingo party before you watch.  Plot and character development are not the primary focus, nor is much given or expected.  In terms of the comedy, both Wayans and Essence Attkins provide hilarious slap stick as demons of a pastiched hell descend upon their abode.  Wayans steps away from a Shorty like character, which gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath before he freaks out again.  Atkins does an excellent job in reacting and provoking the startling actor while managing to keep her character grounded (except for, well...).  It is their performance that drives the movie by staying away from common parody archetypes that are just there to enact the plot. They may not be well rounded, but the actors playing them are assured of their role and seamlessly pass into this absurd world.

The ensemble all provide apt performances; not standing out too far from another.  Perhaps because each portrayed characters they had previously done in other work.  Still, they provide honest laughs (google mandingo party) and not so over blown as seem ridiculous.  Yes, this is a redicoulous world; complete with horny neighbors and security/ghost busters.  Also, beware cut together narrative.  As much as the story is building to something, each moment is more

The homages are so well done they are worth laughs in themselves.  Anyone who has delved into the techinal ascpects of films like ""REC."" and ""Paranormal Activity"" will die when they see their favorite techniques turned on their butts.  Also, while the jokes may seem sophomoric, the underlying narrative does hold critical weight.  As much as it pokes fun at the genre, it also entwines a critical thread analyzing these activies in terms of their psychological effect and, possibly, as a manifestation of their underlying resentment towards one another (Wayans in particular).  Which only goes to show how much depth your average panned comedy has.

Maybe just when a Wayans does it.",1394150400,,2449,4.898058252427185

5531956,1,B00AZMFINM,"This is NOT a clever satire of horror films, but rather, a very low-brow comedy abounding in jokes about sex, race, drugs, and defecation.

When Malcolm's girlfriend, Kisha, moves into his house, the hauntings start.

It's important to know that Malcolm and Kisha are black, because so many jokes concern race. For instance, they're friends with a white couple who are into wife-swapping and a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mandingo/dp/B007RME6T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mandingo</a>&nbsp;fetish. However, though the white wife wants to be gang-raped by black men (and eventually realizes this fantasy, to her grinning husband's pleasure) she also comes onto Kisha.

Yes, there are many gay jokes. A gay psychic, called to communicate with the haunting spirit, instead keeps coming onto Malcolm. This allows for such ""hilarious"" jokes as...

Room goes dark. Everyone screams in fear. Lights come back up.

Malcolm: ""Why are you holding my balls?""

Gay Psychic: ""I'm protecting it from spirits.""

Later, while a priest is trying to exorcise a demon from Kisha, the gay psychic keeps slapping Malcolm's chest (i.e., copping a feel), screaming, ""Begone, spirits, begone!""

Malcolm: ""Why are you hitting me? I'm not the one possessed.""

Later, the psychic convinces Malcolm to dress up in leather bondage gear to exorcise the demon.

At one point the ghost (or demon?) butt-rapes Malcolm. It yanks off Malcolm's pajama bottom (the ghost is invisible), then rapes Malcolm in his rear-end.

In another scene, Malcolm simulates sex with two of his stuffed animals, in a variety of positions.

The priest is black. (He's played by Cedric the Entertainer.) Important to know, as he's such a stereotype. He has an extremely foul mouth, and keeps calling the possessed Kisha a ""b*tch."" He complains about how ""skank"" Kisha is (possessed people tend to stink), and tries to convince Malcolm to forget about her. ""There plenty more b*tches out there,"" says the priest.

This black priest had recently left prison. He brags about all the people he ""shanked,"" (i.e., stabbed), and asks Malcolm if, instead of exorcising Kisha, he wouldn't just rather have him ""skank the b*itch.""

Although in one scene, after the priest calls Kisha a ""b*tch,"" he says to Malcolm, ""Excuse me. That was insensitive. I mean ho.""

Naturally, the priest has marijuana hidden in his Bible. (Ha, ha, a priest with a hollowed-out Bible -- now there's an original joke!).

Yes, in addition to jokes about race and sex, A HAUNTED HOUSE has plenty of drug jokes.

And many defecation jokes. Such as when Kisha sleeps beside Malcolm on her first night after moving in. Malcolm is surprised to learn that Kisha farts all night long. HUGE farts that cause the blankets to rise.

A HAUNTED HOUSE is done as a found footage film, so Malcolm often follows Kisha around with his video camera. Including into the bathroom so he can record her on the toilet. (Ha ha! See Kisha on a toilet!)

At one point, Malcolm comes home drunk. He trips around the living room, spilling an urn -- which contains the ashes to Kisha's father. So then Malcolm pulls down his pants, crouches, and defecates onto the ashes.

A HAUNTED HOUSE also boasts a Latina maid (allowing for sex and drug jokes about Mexicans) and a racist video installer, who asks permission to use the N-word in exchange for letting Malcolm call him a ""cracker.""

A guess this film is supposed to be ""politically incorrect,"" but I was never offended. The jokes are tired and obvious, very broadly drawn, very low-brow. I guess this film might delight adolescents and imbeciles, but I was bored.",1393632000,7,3648,5.128378378378378

Avoid this stinker, unless you enjoyed other movies of its kind.  Then it might be your kind of comedy.

Two stars because I think I laughed twice, once during the ""gost"" scene and the other during the maid scene that happened when Kisha and Malcolm left the house and left the camera recording.

5532374,2,B00AZMFINM,"""A Haunted House slots in-between the gaps of the widely panned spoof films like Vampires Suck and Disaster Movie and the highly delayed Scary Movie 5. Thankfully, this film sticks much to the Wayans' sense of the quirky, crazy, crude, grotesque, and foul in a way where much of the most offensive content on screen revolts at times but still make people laugh at the hilarity of it all.

In a spoof of ridiculously trendy ""found-footage"" horror films and paranormal films like Paranormal Activity, The Exorcist, and The Amityville Horror, Marlon Wayans plays Malcolm and his girlfriend Kisha played by Essence Atkins both live in a large house in California only to find out that a weird, sexually perverted ghost or demonic spirit surrounds their every existence.

The film does not take its subject matter very seriously and often detours toward showcasing rather crude, off-the-wall situations involving fart jokes, aberrational sex acts done by the ghost and a possessed Kisha, interracial flirting cues, and a previously incarcerated reverend who cares much more about quoting Pulp Fiction than performing exorcisms. The humour is always there because the film, much like how I view ghosts and the supernatural, is just one big joke to scare away people or make people believe in superstitious things. Also, the over-the-top trend in these recent horror films and its unnecessary popularity proves for its occasional greatness here in this spoof.

Nothing is spectacular here and nothing in here that upper-crust film critics will love, A Haunted House is and will only be the best and scariest horror and/or comedy involving horny ghosts and the supernatural since The Evil Dead did it when it satirised the slasher horror genre. A good but not very refined film for a boys' night out with beer, tortilla chips, and a day with no football games on TV!""",1373760000,,1859,5.04885993485342

5532448,3,B00AZMFINM,"Indulge me a metaphor. If cinema is sport then most genres, be they action, adventure, thriller, horror or romance, are some variety of the beautiful game: a careful build up from the back, fluid off-the ball movement, the odd languorous long ball into space, snappy interchanges in the middle of the park and clinical execution in the final third.

Comedy spoofs are different. They are more like rugby (or football, for you uncultured Americans) on a wet day. It's about having a game plan, following it, and after that, tackling. Lots and lots of tackling.

Tackling requires full commitment and perfect timing. Go in half-heartedly and you'll get hurt; make the hit early or late and someone else will, and you'll be heading for an early shower.

In a comedy there's no half-hour grace period in which the back four can elegantly stroke the ball around while scene is set and characters introduced: every man needs to be making good hard tackles from the first whistle. Those first critical collisions must all be on the money, or you'll find yourself 15-0 down with a man in the sin-bin before the first quarter's out.

That said, even as you take your seat and flip through the matchday programme, you fear for A Haunted House. Even in its game plan it has the look of a pup about it: it features one, which meets a grisly end, in its opening sequences. Nor are early reports from the American broadsheets encouraging, though I hardly think they figured heavily when Marlon Wayans contemplated his target demographic. (Nor, should I think, did people like me, for that matter.) But it does seem to go over well-raked ground. A Haunted House is a horror-spoof - superficially like the Scary Movie franchise, thus begging the question why Marlon Wayans, with four of those exact movies in the tank and a fifth due to open imminently, isn't leaving the genre well alone.

But look on the bright side: entering this sort of movie with low expectations is the best way to enjoy it. And so it proves.

Early doors the tackle count is certainly high and with Malcolm (Wayans) and Kisha (Essence Atkins) charging around the park like the undead possessed, you brace yourself for each one. Wayans hits each ruck with vigour, and with each contact we feel a flash of relief that the tackle has passed without injury. Before long you've passed the ten minute mark, and with the odd mis-hit, the game plan seems to be working out pretty well.

And so goes on. A ripple of laughter from one corner of the (hardly overstuffed) theatre grows into a general chuckle throughout. One chap on the left starts braying like a donkey. It is infectious. Soon enough we are all at it.

There is nothing original in the screenplay - it is scatologocal, features fart jokes and lots of innuendo - so put most of this down to the actors' commitment and timing in the tackle. Wayans is a likeable, high octane presence and what his script lacks on lofty cerebral planes he makes up for in sheer effort: there are no half hearted shoulder charges here. Everyone commits full bloodedly, and you fancy one or two jokes which might have led to a turnover or even a yellow card in less enthusiastic hands (an extended one-man orgy with cuddly toys, for example) carry through on sheer bravura and timing alone.

The screenplay is uneven, but the script is lively throughout, and there are droll comedy turns from David Koechner as a security expert, Nick Swardson as a gay psychic, Alanna Ubach and Andrew Daly as a couple of would-be swingers and Cedric the Entertainer as an ex-con turned exorcist. The whole thing looks like it was (and apparently was) shot on steadycams on a shoe string.

I dare say the box office takings, already at something like fifteen times production costs before its UK release, will help Marlon Wayans come to terms with a sniffy review in the New York Times.

5532518,2,B00AZMFINM,"""A Haunted House"" is the latest in a long line of movie parody knockoffs that have been all the rage since ""Airplane"" lifted off the runway thirty-three long years ago. This outing takes specific aim at the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies, with sideswipes at ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Exorcist"" along the way.

Marlon Wayans (who co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Alvarez) stars as a hyperkinetic, camera-obsessed young man whose suburban home becomes host to a ghost when his sweet but sassy girlfriend (Marlene Forte) moves in.

The movie does hit on some amusing concepts from time to time, though it has the unfortunate tendency to belabor them past the point where they're really very funny anymore.

He could have easily kicked her out and been done with the haunting.  Instead he hung in there and got his girl some much needed help. Even when she had a thang for Ghost.

While no artist is 100% all the time, the Wayans Brothers have experienced few bombs (okay, other than 2004's White Chicks). They took the horror movie parody genre and made it their own. But Paranormal sucks to begin with, so they didn't have a lot of material to work with. This movie contained very little comedy. The parodies were weak or non-existent. It just didn't work. The only truly laugh-out-loud humor was provided by Cedric the Entertainer as a priest who was brought in to perform an exorcism. That was all of ten minutes tops. The rest of the movie was just disappointing. Hopefully there will be a huddle and a revamping of ideas so that the next WAYANS movie will be funny enough to deserve bearing the WAYANS name.

The jokes are repeative and get old quickly.  The part where the guy has sex with a stuffed animal for almost 5 minutes stopped being funny 5 seconds into it.  The friends constantly suggesting orgies and swinging get old.  The security saleman offering up racist remarks again gets old. The farting gets old.  The demon/spirit/ghost having sex with the couple gets tiresome. The viewer gets beaten over the head by the same jokes one after another after another.

If you're familiar with the comedy style of the Wayans Brothers (in this case, only Marlon was involved), then you know what to expect. This is simply a goofy and raunchy parody of a few of the more popular ""paranormal"" films. There really isn't anything special with this one (not that I was expecting it to be). There were a few laughs here and there, but overall, it was just too silly to be that funny. In comparison to other Wayans' films, like Scary Movie 1 and 2, this one definitely isn't as good as those films. But if you're looking for over-the -top, crude, and raunchy humor, then this one is for you. And personally, I don't mind that type of humor, but I just felt this one was trying a bit too hard and some of the jokes just weren't that funny. But I'm definitely not going to overly critique a film like this. You have to take a film like this for what it is, and its sole purpose is really just to make you laugh.

5532811,1,B00AZMFINM,"Thankfully I didn't buy this, rented it, so didn't waste too much money and turned it off somewhere between start and finish so didn't waste too much time either.  I was really hoping for something funny but this was just offensive on so many levels and I am not politically correct nor do I get offended easily. I don't find anyone getting raped, whether by a ghost or otherwise, funny. I prefer movies that actually contain creative humor and not the low-class, low-brained garbage that was the entirety of this film. It takes intelligence and talent to make a truly funny film, they quickly ran out of both on this one.

I am looking for a few good and funny movies if anyone has any suggestions.  Thank you!",1368662400,,711,4.5390625

This ain't La Strada, y'all.  A Haunted House is a solid parody, and a refreshingly straightforward movie to unwind with after finals, s***** presentation days, ""big pushes"" at work, and traffic jams. Don't go in expecting high brow humor...that is not the purpose of this movie. The purposes of this movie are fart jokes, prat falls, and always presenting the most obvious joke so that the viewer literally doesn't have to think at all. Honestly it reminded me of National Lampoon movies from the late 80s/early 90s. If you just want to hang out in your bedroom and be a dummy this is the movie for you! (P.S.

Which in my mind has taken the torch from Leslie Nielsen's, Naked Gun and Airplane movies and carries on the tradition of ridiculous, juvenile, dirty and slapstick spoofing. Nobody in Hollywood currently executes that formula better. When I first saw Paranormal Activity, it was obvious that movie was begging to be lampooned. And even though it took long enough to come out, Marlon eventually delivered. This is not some revolutionary new style of humor or film making. It's classic rapid fire jokes ranging from lighthearted tomfoolery to gross-out sight gags and overloaded with topical references. It is about a million times better than the most recent Scary Movies, and definitely has more heart.

Other than being boring, it tended to imitate the original movies too closely (mostly the paranormal activity), to the point that some of the scenes were scary and/or too serious. I also didn't enjoy the constant use of the 'home-movie' style that they used; I know that was the point, but it didn't lend anything extra. Scenes were too quiet, the actors were too few and spread too thinly. Besides a few ending sequences where they bring the entire cast together, you are watching the two main characters talk, argue, and attempt to interject humor into the dull environment.

5533049,2,B00AZMFINM,"A Haunted House is a horror spoof that was panned by critics. After seeing it, I can understand why. The reason why I wanted to watch this (despite the bad reviews) is because I'm a fan of the Scary Movie series. I did not expect A Haunted House to be as funny as the original Scary movie, but I was hoping that it would be at least as funny as the sequels to Scary movie. But it wasn't. Not even close. Yes, there are some laughs here and there. But even when I laughed, I felt bad for doing so. Cedric The Entertainer gets the ""biggest"" laughs, and he doesn't even show up until about an hour into the movie. By then, it is too little and way too late. This is one haunted house you want to avoid!",1367280000,,699,4.0359712230215825
5533080,3,B00AZMFINM,"It's impossible to discuss A Haunted House without acknowledging the Scary Movie franchise because not only did Marlon Wayans co-create Scary Movie, but the latest in that franchise just came out recently and parodies some of the same films.  Before Scary Movie was neutered and smashed into the ground into some ridiculous teen parody film, it actually was pretty entertaining.  The first film, in particular, was actually a decent parody and pretty strictly followed the original Scream's story with dialogue taken directly from the script and, most of the time, warped into comedic sensibilities.  While it catered to the lowest common denominator and was filled to the brim with juvenile humor, it also showcased a team that had comedic timing and knew the rules of the genre it was aping (slasher).  It also wasn't just unfunny vignettes with no real over-arching plot tying it together.

So now we have A Haunted House, with Marlon Wayans back in the writing and starring role.  And while it's a step up from what's become of the Scary Movie franchise, it still not as good as the movie that started it all.  A lot of the jokes feel ""been there, done that...only better before.""  The only reason the movie succeeds at all is based on the comedic timing and chemistry between Marlon Wayans and Essence Atkins.  When A Haunted House begins, Malcolm Johnson (Wayans) is expecting his girlfriend Kisha (Atkins) to move in and he, as is required of a found footage film, wants to film everything.  The opening is actually quite smile-inducing because Wayans plays on the found footage genre and throws in a couple funny homages (e.g., quick-panning to the house keeper to startle the viewers, girl arriving and accidentally killing the dog, etc.).  The dialogue is quick, often-times funny, if not laugh-out-loud, and surprisingly subtle.  When a knife is found on the floor and Kisha goes crazy, saying that the house is haunted, I couldn't help but smile because of how quickly they were willing to jump to the paranormal.  The first half is funny and follows Paranormal Activity pretty well.

Then things start to go downhill, as they introduce the go-to-actors to play their stereotypical parts.  Here we have Nick Swardson playing Chip the Psychic, bringing up gay jokes and making Malcolm uncomfortable.  Racism gets addressed as David Koechner shows up, playing the role he always does as the racist Security Man.  Here, the humor relies on very similar (if not the same) jokes Marlon Wayans has mined in the first two Scary Movies (there's even a ghostly sex session...scratch that, two ghostly sex sessions...that is nowhere near as chuckle-inducing as it was with Tori Spelling).  As the movie continued, it felt like it was dragging much longer than the short 86ish minute running time.

The only thing that kept me going was the comedic timing of Essence Atkins specifically and the chemistry between her and Wayans.  They manage to elevate, however small, the score.  I was kind of hoping a return to the original Scary Movie and, to some degree, I got just that.  Just not in a good way.",1367280000,,3102,4.91362763915547

Most of the humor is sex and more sex, homosexuality, farting, racism, which would be okay IF it is funny.  Makes me wonder if SCARY MOVIE 5 is worth my time?  It also may be time to find another genre to spoof!

So, I really don't care what the critics or rotten tomatoes say about this film. When a movie can make me laugh that hard, there's something to that. Even if it all boils down to my own twisted sense of humor.

5533135,3,B00AZMFINM,"Boy, did I ever have trepidations about watching this movie.  Most ""parodies"" just don't cut it for me; I find them too insipid and stupid and just a complete waste of time.  I guess the stars were aligned right for me last night because I watched ""A Haunted House"" and actually found myself laughing several times.  Is it the funniest movie I've ever seen?  Lord no.  Does it entertain?  Hell yes!

The movie is actually a parody of the original ""Paranormal Activity.""  Marlon Wayans' girlfriend moves in with him, immediately kills his dog, and lets loose some sort of demon (because she wanted a pair of Prada sandals when she was little--thus, promising her soul to the devil), and it's ""on like Kong"" after that.  Some scenes don't quite cut it, but most will at least make you chuckle.  I've often said that if you want me to laugh, all you have to do is involve flatulence.  There's one scene here that had me shaking with laughter.  The movie never takes itself seriously, which is nice, thus, the viewer can just relax and enjoy the movie for what it is:  fluff.  Cedric the Entertainer is absolutely hysterical as the Priest.

Rated ""R"" for lots of simulated sex, language, and just plain old raunchy behavior, I'd suggest a trip through this haunted house!",1366761600,3,1267,4.6441441441441444

Little does he know that Kisha has brought along a little extra baggage in the form of a pesky paranormal entity that terrorizes the couple in their new home! A HAUNTED HOUSE is the latest in a long slew of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY spoofs, this time putting SCARY MOVIE's Marlon Wayans in front of the camera as the terrified tenant, Malcolm. While the film contains the same stupid gags and raunchy humor as the other idiotic attempts like SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY and 30 NIGHTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY WITH THE DEVIL INSIDE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, we experience the difference between hiring trained comics and amateur actors first-hand. Wayans is as hilarious as ever playing Malcolm, and draws a laugh even out of the most childish and profane moments in the script. He is joined by several brilliant comics and bit players in equally funny roles, with appearances by David Koechner as Dan the Security Man, Nick Swardson as Chip the Psychic, and Cedric the Entertainer as the recently-released Father Williams. Individually, these characters are given many of the most memorable moments, but there is a clash of personalities as they all join together for the final act. A HAUNTED HOUSE may be debased and utterly depraved, but it is just as enjoyable for fans of the ""found footage"" genre.
