8175808,5,B000NA1W90,"Good late 50's-early 60's Mexican-made horror film.  A pianist has sold his soul for artistic brilliance and fame, but it's a trade-off.  Whenever he hears or plays certain pieces of music he literally goes to the dogs.  He turns into a wolf-man like creature with a lust for murder.  His mother is a Mrs. Danvers type who holds all the family secrets.  His live-in protg wonders about all the mysteries, and a visiting impresario starts delving into all the goings-on.  The monster makeup is somewhat silly, but the sets and atmosphere are great.  The DVD transfer is pristine and excellent, as are all the Casa Negra releases.  It has the film in its original Spanish and in the English-dubbed version.  This version is the one to get.  Highly recommended.",1452297600,2,758,4.8062015503875966

8175810,4,B000NA1W90,"Extravagant, crude, funny, over-the-top, Mexican horror films of the 1950's & 60s are remarkable.  Like Mexico itself, these films are exuberant, frightening and often hilarious.  'Man and the Monster' was one of the first and it includes all the elements:  spooky old 'rancheros,' flustered heroes, hysterical heroines and, close to the center, a powerful witch-like woman who is custodian of all the secrets, keeper of all the keys.  All that's lacking is 'Santo' or any of an arsenal of masked wrestling men who inexplicably interrupt  the action of the film with extended fight scenes in an arena.  This film is surprisingly restrained and sane, but it's still enjoyable, and heightened by superbly expressive photography.  Also, the monster is a goofy-looking critter, derivative of the Universal Studios 'Wolfman' of the 1940s, but still curiously poignant and scary.",1376006400,3,873,5.375
8175811,5,B000NA1W90,"This strange adaption of Oscar Wilde's Dr Jekill & Mr Hyde; is extraodinary.
It was meant to scare friday evening film audiences and continues to thrill some of us.
I would rate it in the same category as The Beast with Five Fingers;
It is a pianistic horror history with some evil points.
An exciting horror film about music madness

8175812,3,B000NA1W90,"For the most part, The Man and the Monster, released in the Mexico as ""El hombre y el monstruo"" is your average 1959 horror flick. It was filmed in the spanish language and then dubbed into english with careful attention paid to matching the dialouge with the actors lips. Unlike most other dubbed efforts, this one is very easy to watch without being distracted by the dubbing.

The film tells the sinister story of a pianist who sells his soul to the devil to become the greatest pianist in the world, with one catch - when he plays, he turns into what appears to be some type of monster/werewolf creature. The makeup effects for the monster are well done and much in alignment with what every other studio was doing at this time.

But what makes this flick really worthwhile is the above average cinematography, atmospheric lighting and the great score. A real nice achievement for the Mexico studio who put this together. makes one wonder what other south of the border classics are out there. It is truly a great looking film with solid acting with an air of creepy fright that is well sustained throughout the entire feature.

While not an all-time classic, Man and the Monster is very much suitable entertainment with much repeat watchability for those who enjoy the 50's sci-fi/horror genre and also for those who enjoy great black and white cinematography punctuated with film noir style lighting.

Check it out...",1179619200,6,1423,4.772357723577236
8175813,5,B000NA1W90,"The Man and the Monster is actually a really good classic horror film.  Visually and stylistically it borrows from the elements of other Mexican horror classics such as The Vampire and Curse of the Crying Woman.  Most of these classic Mexican horror films were shot on the same sets however with each film the sets are manipulated and added to, subtracted from to make it look quite different and provide unique levels of atmosphere in each movie.  The scenes shot in the Hacienda courtyard where Rambal's monstrous character lives are beautifully composed and deliciously lit. Director Baledon does a great job directing this film. People who have seen this film agree the monster is not terribly ""monstrous"" and is more funny to look at then scary but for me it does not detract from what a good film it really is.  The film as a whole is quite an accomplishment with excellent acting and wonderful direction and photography. The film is pristine and probably even looks better then when people first saw it back in the 50s. The restoration on the DVD is absolutely perfect and on par with previous CasaNegra releases.  A key feature of the DVD is a really fantastic Mexican Horror Poster slideshow set to music from the film which I also thought was really great.",1172707200,12,1266,4.762557077625571

The US release of this film listed here on Amazon is from a company called Beverly Wilshire Filmworks released in 2000.  It is a factory pressed DVD with nice clean transfer and Dolby Digital sound comparable to the other 50's sci fi/horror studio releases out there.  Also includes a menu and several chapter selections.

While not an all-time classic, man and the Monster is very much suitable entertainment with much repeat watchability for those who enjoy the 50's sci-fi/horror genre and also for those who enjoy great black and white cinematography punctuated with film noir style lighting.

And best of all the DVD is very affordable.  Check it out...",1164412800,,1878,4.773993808049536
