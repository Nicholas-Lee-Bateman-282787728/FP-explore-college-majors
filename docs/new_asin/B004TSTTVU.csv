4466003,4,B004TSTTVU,"Luke fon Fabre is the son of a noble from the kingdom of Kimlasca-Lavaldear. He has led a very sheltered life due to an incident 7 years ago, when he was abducted by agents from the neighboring Malkuth Empire. But one day while training with his mentor, Van Grants, a strange woman breaks into the mansion. She comes with the sole intent of killing Van, but an accident occurs and Luke and Tear are magically transported far away. Now the spoiled and naive Luke must team up with the calm and capable Tear in order to survive his first jaunt into the real world. But the journey will change him far more than he ever could have imagined.

I was introduced to the Tales series through the Tales of Symphonia game, which I enjoyed for both gameplay and storyline. As I looked for more games in the series, I stumbled across the Tales of the Abyss anime. I kind of wanted to play the game, but didn't want to buy a PS2 game, so I opted for the anime instead. I was impressed. I've seen plenty of shows based off of video games and am usually disappointed. But if I hadn't known this show was based off of a game, I might never have guessed - until they started pasting the attack names at the top of the screen :P
The story was fast paced and sprinkled with twists. The characters were interesting and I really enjoyed Luke's growth (he starts out as an annoying brat and matures into a rather likable guy). The story was a little confusing/messy at times, but apparently the game is about 50 hours long, so I can understand that some clarity might be cut to fit stuff in. It didn't really bother me too much.

This release is sub only (no English language track), which didn't bother me as I normally watch anime with subs. I seriously doubt there will ever be a dub release, so don't wait for it. There will be a total of 4 volumes (26 episodes) released (4th one comes out 2/7/12) and there probably won't be any box set released (Bandai is shutting down their DVD releases and shifting focus to licensing). So this series will be a little bit expensive to collect (probably around $15-$20 a volume if you buy from Amazon). After finishing the series, I thought I'd probably buy it one day, but I was hoping for a boxed set. So I liked it, but maybe not enough to spend $60-$80 for it. I'll think about it though, which actually says a lot, since I can't remember the last time I paid that much for an anime.",1325548800,10,2408,4.337028824833703
4466004,5,B004TSTTVU,"Tales of the Abyss was a game that came out for the PS2 in 2005 in Japan and a year later in the US. It became my second favorite game ever, after Tales of Vesperia. While I have gone through the game multiple times I have so far only seen the episodes of the anime that come with this set. That said, so far the anime adaptation is faithful to the original story. It is much more faithful to the events of the game than the Tales of Symphonia OVA was (although that was still a good show, it was just condensed way too much). It feels a little rushed at times but that is what happens when you squeeze a 60-70 hour game into a single season anime.

The DVD set has the first seven episodes, as well as the collectors edition adding part one of the Asch the Bloody manga to the set. It is a neat addition but if you do not care about the manga you can pick up the regular version for a little less. The show is in Japanese with English subtitles which was a smart choice. Being such a fan of the game I would have only liked a dubbed version if all the original voice actors came back to do this and that is unlikely with as busy as many of them are.

Of course this is just one disc release. At the rate they are going, it will probably take three more discs to finish the series, which will add up to a lot of money. However they haven't announced a full season set yet though so this may end up being the only way to get it. Only time will tell. Anyway if you are a fan of the game, pick this up. Also, if you are a fan of the Tales game series of which Tales of the Abyss is a part, in 2012 the Nintendo 3DS port of Tales of the Abyss and the anime movie prequel to Tales of Vesperia comes here to the US. Tales of Graces F for the PS3 also is expected to come out Q1 2012.",1318464000,6,1777,3.8925619834710745
4466005,5,B004TSTTVU,"Basically this follows the story of the Playstation 2 game pretty faithfully, contains no English audio, and is being released in multiple parts by Bandai.

Very enjoyable series, has a very entertaining opening song, and is very well animated.

A must buy show, forget the fact it doesnt have a dub, if you're a dub follower, take a step into the sub world and experience the awesomeness of the show.

It will likely be released in 3-4 volumes, so for a 26 episode that works out at $100 or so dollars for a subtitled DVD set.

Pros

Good series
Good story
Very well animated

Cons

No Dub
Very expensive to follow

Decide for yourself, its a good series regardless.",1308355200,9,667,4.546218487394958

8440860,5,B004TSTTVU,"One of my favorite series of all the anime's that I have. It will make you laugh, question yourself on what will actually happen next, and maybe even cry for some of the characters and their situations. Highly recommend it, but act fast the series is out of print so not to many copies are in circulation by sellers.",1430870400,,316,4.372881355932203
8440861,5,B004TSTTVU,"Anime based on games are usually disappointing, but not this one.
The battles felt a bit rushed, but the story was executed perfectly, I think everyone who played the game would agree.
The limited edition is awesome, and the price is very good for all 4 parts.",1422230400,,260,4.553191489361702
8440862,5,B004TSTTVU,"I'm very glad I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday!! This anime is VERY hard to find and these came just in time in perfect condition, still in it's original wrapping, just as advertised :3",1392422400,,201,4.45945945945946
8440863,5,B004TSTTVU,"I really like this OVA, it expands upon some of the characters by providing some extra scenes not present in the game to introduce Natalia and her relationship to both Guy and Luke before she is ever formally introduced in the game. I also like the overall condensed narrative that cuts out superflourous events from the game that did not pertain to the overall plot, making the first volume a very coherent, concise series of episodes. Well done and I can't wait for the next 3 parts!",1370908800,,485,4.586206896551724
8440864,5,B004TSTTVU,I loved this series as a game and it being turned into an anime is amazing. They followed the game line perfectly. I truly recommend this to any Tales of fan out there.,1361491200,,168,4.121212121212121
8440865,5,B004TSTTVU,I love being able to watch this wherever and whenever. It's a great OVA and reminds me of the PS2 video game a lot!,1355616000,,115,3.8333333333333335
8440866,5,B004TSTTVU,"It's a great deal for what it gives you. Sure it sucks that there are no english dubs, but who cares? If you want it bad enough to pay then you want it bad enough to read.",1346889600,,171,3.6486486486486487
8440867,5,B004TSTTVU,"The anime pretty much follows Tales of the Abyss almost scene per scene word per word. It's an anime adaption of one of the greatest PS2 RPG's of all time. The only downside to the anime is that it's not big on action and heavy on dialogue. It's better appreciated if you play the game first and then watch the anime. If you play the game first you can get a better sense of just how intense some of the scenes dipicted in the anime actually are, instead of just some talking dialogue. I do admit watching the show will also give you major spoilers that might take away from the game. It's still great to watch although I'm not sure how someone not familiar with the game itself might enjoy it as it can be a pretty confusing story plot without knowing the back history of it. Tales of the Abyss is a pretty deep game and it's good there's also an anime to cover the action.",1346457600,,874,4.208333333333333
8440868,4,B004TSTTVU,This is a very good anime series but it would have been better with and Englidh dub because I found it hard to enjoy the the anime detail while reading the subtitles,1329868800,,165,4.1875
