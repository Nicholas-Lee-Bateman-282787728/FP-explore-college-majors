This concert to me is just as good as the third concert in Japan and might even surpass it. The crowd was much more enthusiastic  during this performance. The production value i think is higher as well. The only way this concert could have been better is if Jessica was still in the group but the girls performed so well that i didn't notice her absence as much as i thought i would. All the new songs they performed since the last concert were excellent. The song ""Sugar"" a duet sung by Sunny and Yoona is worth the price of admission alone. They begin the song among the audience and touch and shake hands with so many of them. I've never seen any of the members interact with the audience like that  in any previous concerts I've seen of them. The audience was stunned and excited by this and the song was one of the best of the concert.  If you liked the third concert in Japan you should get this one as well.",1477958400,,1078,4.300492610837439
