3880430,3,B0029R81KI,"National Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray] (2007) - I am restricting my rating to the quality of the home 3D experience provided by the Blue Ray copy on an LCD 52"" HDTV using the correctly colored glasses. It was only a credible 3D experience compared to other films I have seen in theaters, but not nearly as good as IMAX 3D presented in the IMAX theaters. It was an interesting enough film, but less of a headache to watch in 2D, which is also provided on the Blu Ray DVD.  The 2D copy is very clear when played on Blu-Ray and the program material was just ok.",1263254400,,598,4.339285714285714

3880433,1,B0029R81KI,"Got this movie because of the reviews and my love of 3-D on my HD TV. First, the glasses had the red and blue reversed, making them unusable, but when viewing this mess, with glasses I had, there was no part of the experience that came even close to being 3-D. Unless I got a very bad copy, this was as dull in content as I would ever wish to experience, so the only thing that could possibly have saved it would have been spectacular 3-D.
National Geographic has really gone way down if they consider this entertainment, and as far as the other reviewers go...well! Maybe I'm not as easily entertained as they are!

When I saw this movie was released on Blu-Ray in 3D I was hesitant thinking the 3D at home would be a joke. I was proven otherwise. Even on the comfort of my couch the 3D is amazing.

3880470,4,B0029R81KI,"Rating:
2D version:  4 stars
3D version:  2 stars (perhaps too generous)
So--why didn't I give this an averaged out 3 stars?  Details below.

I should have read the reviews on this product--the ones that warn you that this is NOT a MODERN 3D production--but instead, an old-fashioned, 1950's style ""red on the left, blue on the right"" cardboard glasses, 3D production.  The ghosting of the images was so bad that you could STILL see practically 2 full images with the glasses.  After less than 5 minutes into this thing, my 10 year old, (normally crazy for 3D features), actually asked me to stop and run it in 2D!

The good news is that this is a VERY beautiful feature in 2D.  The color was very good, the detail was quite excellent.  My Father-in-Law (who came into the room after the switch) thought it might be in 3D when he first looked at it--the detail was so good.  (It was watched on a UHD TV, which may have affected that, BUT the fact that it stands up to a UHD TV is a good thing in and of itself.)

As to the final rating, I had trouble deciding between 3 stars and 4.  I strongly felt that a 3 would be an injustice to the 2D version, while at the same time being overly generous to the 3D.  I finally decided to rate it at a 4, _based on the 2D version alone_, because it IS that good in 2D, and the price was about where I would expect a 2D short documentary to be, so I didn't feel ripped off by not being able to even _want_ to watch it in 3D.",1413676800,,1462,4.123674911660777

I originally got this for the family (with no 3D TV) but watched it first (in a nice dark room) to see what it was like.  WOW!  First the story was excellent.  The graphics were great and some of the 3D on this was better than what I've bought on 3D TV movies (Jurassic Park comes to mind - for one).  Seriously, I was really impressed. I showed several of my friends and then bought a copy for me and my father.  Yes, I thought it was that good and I'm proud to give National Geographic 5 full stars. In my humble opinion this was an excellent movie and everyone I've showed it to has thought so as well. Great 3D no special equipment required.",1402444800,,708,4.169117647058823

3880513,5,B0029R81KI,when i got this dvd i knew it had to be good. national geographic usually do not fail me. the documentary tells the story of a female dolphin like prehistoric creature whose fossils were found 80 million years later. watching this in 3-d with the glasses is dreamlike and incredible. an added treat is the other sea creatures and great story and narration. discovery channel has always done good documentaries on dinosaurs now national geographic gets equal billing.,1268265600,,466,4.987179487179487
3880514,3,B0029R81KI,"This is a movie with amazing content and I was happy to see there was a 3-D version of it. So I bought it on BluRay, excitedly put on the cheap cardboard red/blue glasses and waited to be mesmerized by the 3-D. And waited. And waited some more..

Sadly, this is one 3-D that is underwhelming really. Thankfully the BluRay copy also included a regular 2-D version.

In 3-D, I noted the following - you need to raise the TV's brightness and/or dim your room lights. You need to sit quite close to the TV so your field of view is really the entire TV only. The movies was almost in dual-color ( some weird shade of red edge mostly ) or felt like it was in black and white. It seemed that color reproduction was very poor in 3-D. By contrast, 2-D was pretty good on BluRay. Not excellent, but good.

Overall, the true Avatar type 3-D experience is not there. So, if you're looking for superb 3-D mesmerizing effects, prepare to be dismayed. There's no fishes popping out of the TV or creatures jumping at your face.

After some time, I gave up and watched the 2-D version. Its still worth the $20 though.",1267574400,5,1100,4.325242718446602

8358082,3,B0029R81KI,"Narrated by Liev Schreiber and featuring music by Peter Gabriel, Sea Monsters is a cg/live-action documentary of the life of a Dolichorhynchops named Dolly. It follows her existence from birth till death with filmmakers piecing together her journey from fossilized remains that are unearthed over a few decades. Some awe inspiring shots of giant prehistoric beasts prowling the depths of Cretaceous Period oceans. The only problematic area is some of the compositing, which results in creatures not quite blending in with the live-action plates at times. But overall a short, fun and educational experience.
