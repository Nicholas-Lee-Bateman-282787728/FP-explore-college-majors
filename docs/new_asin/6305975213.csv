7898751,3,6305975213,"Vincent Pastore is the best in this film about Vincent Dianni(Danny Aiello) a soldier and hitman for TheGenovese Crime Family. Aiello is on the death list of Acting Boss Mr. Joseph(Mark Margolis) who also complains about the hot-tempered Matty Brancato from Boston,Massachussetts who Dianni severly injures for shooting a friend. This is a alright film. If you like A Brooklyn State of Mind then get it!",1390003200,,403,5.121212121212121
7898752,1,6305975213,This movie was not up to Danny Aeilo's talent. A very slow moving plot that really went nowhere. The main reason I purchased the movie was to see Timi Romolini and she had a ten second part with two words.,1339113600,,205,4.15
7898753,4,6305975213,"What's up mob fan's? this is james45 and I disagree with Just Another Opinions'review. Hit Man's Journal is a sad story about the not so glamorous life within the rackets ! Danny Aiello is good as always so is his supporting cast,all of them!! from Mark Margolis to Raymond Serra on down. It's sad because Mr. Aiellos' caracter seems to know his time is short due to the road his friend,(William Forsythes' caracter)is travelling, a road vincent surely travelled himself on the way to becoming respected. In the end he's not surprised,he simply moves over for the next up and coming mafioso.sad atmosphere but that's the life.",1273536000,,626,4.859813084112149
7898754,1,6305975213,"For those who admire the talented Danny Aiello, this one comes as something of a disappointment.  Although Aiello does his best, no one could do much with a script as muddled as this one.  The supporting cast is fair, but again, the script does not allow anyone in the cast to shine.  The direction is equally uninspired, giving the viewer the impression that this is just another haphazardly-made little potboiler.  That is too bad, because a fine actor like Danny Aiello deserves better, and so do his fans.  Pass this one up; it's a dud from start to finish.",1142812800,3,561,4.626262626262626
