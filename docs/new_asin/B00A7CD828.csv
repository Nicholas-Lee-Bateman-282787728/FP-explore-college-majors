5392092,2,B00A7CD828,"I've used one of these DVDs and loved it. This one had technical difficulties. The music is at the right level, but the speaking is distorted. I've tried to use it a few times, but it's too distracting. Bummer.",1391990400,3,210,4.410256410256411
5392093,5,B00A7CD828,"I love this dvd, it has helped me with many of my aches and pains in my hips and legs. The music is beautiful and relaxing . I also have the one hour version and four other Yahweh yoga dvds, I love them all.",1387152000,12,207,3.727272727272727
5392094,5,B00A7CD828,"The 30 minute version of Stretch, Relax and Restore is truly wonderful for mind and body.  It's a nice half hour session that really relaxes the mind while getting in a good deep stretch.  I am a beginner at yoga and find that this DVD really helps me to build flexibility when I do it a couple times a week.  Also, the prayer-centered practice can ease even the most stressed of minds.  I absolutely love this DVD and would definitely recommend it!",1377475200,10,449,4.439024390243903
5392095,5,B00A7CD828,"This DVD is beautifully produced with a very calm and peaceful setting. The teacher was very gentle and constant throughout so I was able to really have my own practice, which I think is very important for yoga DVDs. It takes you through a series of stretches and poses that really do leave you relaxed and restored. Great DVD with a perfectly fitting name.",1374019200,8,357,4.59375
8547764,4,B00A7CD828,"DVD received badly scratched but it has good audio and video so will keep it.  Starts out slow and is simple and basic, just what I needed for easing into stretching since I have a couple of injuries that have kept me from exercising for quite a while.  Gotta start somewhere so glad I found something!",1505001600,,302,4.375
8547765,5,B00A7CD828,Just what I was looking for!!! I always wanted to get the health benefits of Yoga but didn't want the New Age and eastern religion influences. I love the fact that we are breathing in the word of God and praying and praising Him while doing the exercises. This builds your faith and your physical endurance at the same time! Well done!!!,1504051200,2,337,4.451612903225806
8547766,5,B00A7CD828,"I bought this and the 1-hour Gentle Journey Level 2 Christian Yoga DVD. I tried this one, but hasn't tried the other one yet. Wow! I work full-time and spend a lot of time ministering in 3rd World Countries. When I get up I want to exercise, stretch, pray and workout, but I have to be at work by about 7:00. For me, this is that perfect program. It starts with stretching and a little worship and meditation on a Scripture promise. It is so encouraging! Throughout the peaceful workout there are encouraging reminders of who we are in Christ, and how great our God is. I am so glad I found this wonderful DVD. When I finished the workout I felt energized, peaceful, encouraged, relaxed, strengthened and inspired. I am looking forward to doing the next workout today. Thank you for this beautiful ministry.",1466899200,13,807,4.572413793103448
8547767,1,B00A7CD828,Not very impressed with this video. Too basic and not a lot of stretching involved.,1466553600,2,83,4.6
8547768,5,B00A7CD828,"This is the first time I have done yoga. While others have complained that there isn't much but laying on your back, it is perfect for me. I have had 4 hip surgeries in 3 1/2 years, two scopes, one replacement and the last being a revision. This video has helped stretch muscles that have been tight for a long time. It has helped my pain and increased my flexibility and strength. Note: at the beginning of the video there is a message that you need hand weights (which you are never instructed to use) and also that it is an hour long (it isn't, it's a half an hour). I'm guessing that a one hour long video was shortened to make this one and the audio was never changed to reflect this dvd. But those mistakes are easy to overlook. The instructors voice and accompanying music are relaxing.",1463270400,12,793,4.328859060402684
8547769,5,B00A7CD828,"I  hurt my back recently, and someone recommended that I try Yoga! I wanted to start out slow to just gain the strength back in my core. I love this video. There are many different workouts depending on how I'm feeling at that time. Great purchase, would highly recommend for someone new to Yoga, or sometime just needing to destress!",1457568000,5,334,4.566666666666666

8547771,1,B00A7CD828,"For the entire routine you are resting on your back with the exception of 2 bridge poses. You might as well do your own devotional, put your Pandora on the gospel station and lay down.  And I plan to get a refund.",1456790400,4,213,4.071428571428571
8547772,5,B00A7CD828,"I enjoy this 1/2 hour of Christian yoga, as I am a beginner and this is easy to follow, and also the music and the instructors voice is very soothing. I would recommend this to anyone, who is looking for a short yoga time.",1446595200,12,222,4.068181818181818
8547773,5,B00A7CD828,This is a perfect half-hour of spiritual and physical renewal.  I have recommended to my friends in yoga class.,1439856000,5,111,4.842105263157895
