7356904,1,B012O291UG,"A very disappointing film, not saved by some (not all) good songs.
Full of clichs, poorly solved side-plots, shallow.
It fails to be a comedy and fails at being a musical.
Beautiful landscapes though and some good dancing.",1444435200,3,222,4.868421052631579
8726280,5,B012O291UG,"If you like Juan Gabriel, I think you'll enjoy this movie.  Might be a bit B quality but still lovable and worth watching, I actually watched it the second night and enjoyed it more for catching things I didn't see the first time.",1495411200,,230,4.348837209302325
