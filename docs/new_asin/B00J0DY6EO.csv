6308234,5,B00J0DY6EO,These are awesome.  I love being able to watch full episodes with many of the vintage commercials that played during the broadcast.  I own quite a few different Johnny Carson products and these are by far my favorite.  Hopefully they keep producing more.  This 5 disc set is an exceptional value.,1412985600,22,296,4.745098039215686
6308235,5,B00J0DY6EO,"I mean, what they did earlier was fine, but I really admired DVD like this that featured not only the whole show but commercials as well.  This is a real treasure, especially for a guy trying to study Johnny Carson's craft.",1412553600,15,223,4.439024390243903
6308236,5,B00J0DY6EO,"Great full episodes WITH commercials. I love this series! More, please!",1411344000,3,71,5.545454545454546
6308237,4,B00J0DY6EO,"The biggest reason I purchased this collection is because I was one of the
Mighty Carson Art Players off and on for about two and a half years.  Naturally,
I was looking for some of my skits.  I did enjoy Johnny's guests.  This is Johnny
at his best.  Oh, yes...BTW, Johnny is a great guy to work with.",1402185600,8,302,4.155172413793103
6308238,5,B00J0DY6EO,Love these full shows with the commercial options ..what terrific memories it brought back!!! Keep them coming ..they are terrific!!!,1401494400,13,133,5.7
6308239,5,B00J0DY6EO,A fascinating and very enjoyable look back at the master himself along with some really great interviews with the stars of that time period...The vintage commercials were a bonus and I liked them almost as much as the rest of the show...Watched the extra bit on volume 4 last night where Johnny's guest was Orson Welles and that was fantastic....There will never be another late night talk show performer like Johnny and his sidekicks Ed McMahon and Doc Severinsen ans this DVD set is a great gift for yourself or for anyone who loved Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show....I liked this set so much that I just ordered volumes 7-12....Highly recommended,1438819200,3,652,4.830357142857143

6308244,5,B00J0DY6EO,Wonderful. Johnny Carson is/was the only really funny and talented late night host that we have had. Letterman sucks.,1425081600,,117,5.2105263157894735
6308245,2,B00J0DY6EO,"We thought it would be more of Johnny with animals etc.  i guess we just don't enjoy the old comedians who just sit there trying to be funny.  I love Carson skits etc., but there wasn't much of that.",1424217600,,199,4.076923076923077

6308247,4,B00J0DY6EO,"Complete episodes of the show, not just snippets of the funniest or the best of the best. Many well known faces here. It's a nice blast from the past and a good way to pass the time, with those stars of yesterday. A lot of funny lines and laughs are promised.",1423958400,3,259,4.098039215686274
6308248,3,B00J0DY6EO,Just okay when compared to the ones advertised on TV. Not as fury but the price is better.,1423785600,,90,4.055555555555555
6308249,5,B00J0DY6EO,"I highly recommend this collection. When you watch a full 90 minutes, you typically see five or six guest rather than two or three. The guests toward the end of a 90 minute show would not be seen so much during a 60 minute episode. They were typically singers, character actors, B-movie actors, and writers. I watched an episode last night with Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Gallagher, David Brenner, and Bert Mustin. Mr. Mustin said one of the funniest things in the entire episode. The later guest, like Mustin, rounded out the show so nicely. After 60 minutes, you just want more. 90 minutes was the perfect time for TTS; it really made it seem like a variety show to have so many guests in one night. Buy this video and watch a full 90 minute episode with vintage commercials (about 70 minutes long, since it is without the local commercials.)",1421452800,5,846,4.6092715231788075
6308250,5,B00J0DY6EO,"I was a big fan of Carson,this series has not disappointed me! Their is nobody today who is as funny as Johnny!",1420588800,,111,4.090909090909091
