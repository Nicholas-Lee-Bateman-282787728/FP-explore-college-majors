If you are a fan of William Wegman's books this is something you definitely should buy - so creative and imaginative!

You can watch this video over and over again and still laugh at all the funny stuff !

I highly recommend this video!!!!",1169424000,7,308,4.446428571428571
2625027,3,B000H0M43O,"I viewed this DVD at the store in the new de Young art museum and I and other adults watching couldn't help laughing at this clever and cute video!  Sure, it's silly sometimes but that is part of its charm.  It's cheap, educational entertainment.  Plus, after watching it, I'm inspired to get a Weimaraner!  :)",1168473600,,310,4.581818181818182
2625028,5,B000H0M43O,This is so clever and hilarious! It's full of laugh-out-loud comedy in every scene -- really great. Perfect whatever age... you don't even have to love dogs to love this.,1167609600,6,170,4.7
2625029,5,B000H0M43O,"Watched the VHS version with my kids, so glad to see it on DVD for the new generation. Great video.",1386720000,,99,4.0
2625030,5,B000H0M43O,"Would buy more Wegman, is too bad they have apparently stopped production.  What a great way for a youngster to learn their ABC's.",1362182400,,130,4.6521739130434785
2625031,5,B000H0M43O,"My personal favorite of the Wegman videos.  Originally had it on VHS and recently purchased it on DVD.  It is a bit slow, but it is a children's video and my grandchildren love it.",1322438400,,180,4.264705882352941
2625032,5,B000H0M43O,"I first saw this at a museum in San Francisco. I must have stood there for 10 minutes as a preview of this DVD continued to loop.  I knew I had to have it for my granchildren.  The dogs are delightful and oh so funny as they ""act"" out the alphabet and make the soup.  The pace of the video is refreshingly calm.  So many childrens' video seemed strained in their effort to be entertaining while also attempting to be educational.  This video is sweet, calm and WONDERFUL!  And my grandchildren love it!",1317254400,,502,4.344086021505376
2625033,4,B000H0M43O,"A fun video for all ages.  And real dogs are used, no animation, different and appreciated for todays kiddos!",1301529600,,109,4.7368421052631575
2625034,5,B000H0M43O,A pretty hilarious alphabet video. Kind of seems more appealing to the adults in our family than the children.,1272499200,,110,4.842105263157895
2625035,5,B000H0M43O,I first saw Alphabet Soup in a Ft. Worth museum and my best friend and I stood there for about 20 minutes in hysterical laughter.  We each bought one for our respective grandchildren.  That was over 10 years ago.... and I still buy them for children of family and friends - and in many cases watch it over with them.  The reactions of the children are a wonderful additon to this amazing story of the alphabet and William Wegman's outstanding dogs.  I have never tired of it in all these years and it never fails to bring a lot of laughs.,1251676800,11,538,4.297029702970297
2625036,5,B000H0M43O,"I bought this for my three year old daughter, not only are we both entertained by it, but it has helped her with A is for ___, B is for ___, and so on.  I'd buy it again.",1219190400,,170,3.473684210526316

2625038,3,B000H0M43O,"As an adult I thought the dvd was really cute. My 2 year old grand daughter, who is fasinated by Sponge Bob, Dora, and loves dogs, was less interested. She already knows her alphabet at age two, so I am not sure that when  she gets older it will hold her attention either. At two it couldn't hold her attention.",1171065600,,311,4.183333333333334

8135624,5,B000H0M43O,"This is a short film great for kids and adults alike, starring William Wegman's  Weimaraners, Fay Ray and her offspring Batty, Chundo and Crooky.  Together they form the letters of the alphabet, and cook up a pot of alphabet soup consisting of all the ingredients from apples to zucchini.  Although it's a great educational film to teach young children the alphabet, adults will be entertained and amused.",1417996800,,405,5.014925373134329

8135627,5,B000H0M43O,"I had William Wegman books and videos for my boys when they were young. They loved them! Alphabet Soup was my favorite. I am glad to see with this current purchase that my memories are valid. I still love this film!

These days I regularly hire consultants who are moms taking a few years off to be with their babies. They bring their babies to my office when we meet then take the work home with them. I bought several Wegman books and videos (Alphabet Soup, Mother Goose and Hardly Boys) to help keep the little ones entertained while we adults talk. What a miracle! The kids are entertained with fun, educational and whimsical material. It is fun for us adults to have Wegman video sounds in the background. Kids will stare at the pages of the Cinderella book for ages, their faces lit with the power of wonder and imagination. A general atmosphere of whimsy invades my office and we are all the better for it.  No matter how old you are, you will love William Wegman and his dogs.",1402185600,,984,4.430939226519337
