3741372,5,B001P807QI,"It's great for fans of the new episodes that this is being released. However, I am only a fan of the original episodes that I watched when I was in fifth grade. They released the Inidgo season in three boxed sets and after hesitating I bought them to finally rewatch the old series and realized I not only found it enjoyable reliving my childhood but also found it more enjoyable than I remembered and filled with alot more tongue in cheek humor than the cutesiness so often associated with it. After years of listening to people my age bash it through later years I must have started thinking of it as a kiddy show, but when you watch it and if you don't mind animation the writing is very funny, I had forgotten that was one of the reasons it was so entertaining apart from the feeling of adventure (that I still in part wish I could go on).

When the show was originally on I only watched up to the end of the Orange Island episodes before I felt too old to do it anymore. As I've said lately I bought the Indigo sets and the Orange Islands set and loved rewatching them so I took a chance and bought the Master Quest Boxed sets 1 and 2 (which are season 5 of the show), I didn't think they were overall as great but the writing was still very funny and the continued adventure of these characters, that felt like old friends from my childhood, was appealing enough to make those sets very enjoyable. Now I come to my problem.

I thought in line with their recent releases of the first seasons that VIZ would release the Johto Boxed Sets of Season 3, *The Johto Journeys, and Season 4, *Road to the Johto League Championship, but I haven't heard or seen anything about them yet. I know those series were already released on DVD/VHS but only in individual releases of three episodes and the fourth season in releases of only seven episodes. I would much rather prefer Boxed Sets of these seasons but for some reason they stopped putting out the old episodes and only seem to be focused on the newer ones (which I saw once on tv and couldn't stand the voices or the new writing, but that's just because I didn't grow up on it), I see alot of the Pokemon All Star releases planned for episodes around 'Favorite' Pokemon and I've seen New Frontier and Diamond and Pearl box sets out for release but no more Johto sets. I am a little annoyed by this, and though this product is good for your children or you if you like it, I just want to be able to watch the rest of the Johto episodes and obtain them easily and inexpensively in the form of a DVD set.

Someone please tell me if you ever know anything about the Johto sets or even if you're just waiting for them like I am so I know I'm not the only one left hanging by VIZ.

Sorry this review isn't all that much about the product listed but if you're a fan of the newer episodes it's a great way to collect them, if your more a fan of the older episodes I don't find the new ones as well done and the newer Pokemon designs got too weird for me, but you may enjoy them.

The sets are made of three slim disc cases and are held in sturdy cardboard slipcover cases, of which they slide out one open side. Here is a list of the 17 episodes that should be on this set finishing out the tenth season based on the previous two:

501 An Elite Meet and Greet!__502 A Secret Sphere of Influence!
503 The Grass Menagerie!____504 One Big Happiny Family!
505 Steamboat Willies!_______506 Top - Down Training!
507 A Stand-Up Sit-Down!___508 The Electrike Company!
509 Malice in Wonderland!____510 Mass Hip-Po-Sis!
511 Ill-Will Hunting_________512 A Maze-ing Race!
513 Sandshrew's Locker_____514 Dawn's Early Night
515 Tag! We're It...!_______516 Glory Blaze
517 Smells Like Team Spirit!

Also The TV Movie Rise Of Darkrai, available on DVD, supposedly takes place between episode 506 and 507.

Thanks For Your Time.",1231804800,16,3853,4.409282700421941

3741387,5,B001P807QI,"Ever since the Pok&eacute;mon anim&eacute; went to wide screen & HD in the middle of Diamond & Pearl (halfway through Galactic Battles [12th season]), VIZ has been charging more and more for fewer episodes on each DVD box set, however, this set changes all that. With four discs containing the entire second half of 15th season (Black & White Rival Destinies [25 episodes]), it's the first in a long time that's worth even the retail price ($26.99) - and even better if you can get it for a discount!!

Not just for the number of episodes you get, but as BW (or Best Wishes, as called in Japan) transitions to Best Wishes2, as mythical Pok&eacute;mon Meloetta joins the group, Ash is reunited with traveling companion Dawn and champion Cynthia from the Sinnoh region, linking Black & White to the preceding Diamond & Pearl, adding some of that series' depth to the much-lighter-by-comparison BW series. I could go on about everything else I enjoyed about BW - the anim&eacute;'s (and TPCi's) best English-dubbed series by far, Team Rocket finally getting a life (that saga ending with the 2-part Meloetta epic), and Ash's Unova journey overall whose best episodes start on this box set.

So glad to also see in that 16th season (BW Adventures in Unova) has already been announced with its first DVD release will be another 4-disc box set, reasonably priced, which will likely include the Unova League (and the few preceding episodes), and the epic 14-part Episode N. Thanks for making the Pok&eacute;mon anim&eacute; affordable again!",1404172800,,1534,4.941860465116279
