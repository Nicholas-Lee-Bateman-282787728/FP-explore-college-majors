2664307,5,B000IZECRO,My son is almost 2 and he loves this DVD.  He asks for it everyday.  The music is unique and entertaining for all ages.  The images are great as well!  I have bought this DVD for all my friends with children and expectant parents. It is a favorite!,1256428800,2,248,4.104166666666667
2664308,5,B000IZECRO,I can't stop singing these songs!!!  The video is awesome and sometimes I just connect it to the TV with no sound to be a giant screen saver....fish tank in my living room!,1254873600,,172,4.212121212121212
2664309,5,B000IZECRO,I am a first grade teacher and every student in my class just loved this dvd.  The songs were catchy and the real sea life creatures provided wonderful teaching opportunities.,1243728000,5,175,4.833333333333333
2664310,3,B000IZECRO,I love this gentleman's music! And my one year old daughter does as well. I also use his CDs in my classrooms with preschool (3 year olds) and kindergarten children and they are well recieved! The video was okay- not great. It is nice to have going in the background while the kids are studying the ocean- but it is not the kind of video that they will enjoy just sitting and watching. I wish the fish were labeled at the bottom of the screen or something- to make it an educational piece.,1241049600,,489,4.268817204301075
2664311,5,B000IZECRO,"I got this for my son when he was 2.  He's 4 now and still asks for this dvd before he goes to bed.  Calls it his ""swimmy sleeping show"".  Beautiful footage (about 80% filmed at major aquariums) is a pleasure to watch.  I was checking out his other DVDs but noticed the one and only review said the moose dvd repeated 10 minutes of footage over & over... not the case with this Sea Tunes for Kids!  Highly recommend!!!",1215475200,6,418,4.175
2664312,5,B000IZECRO,"This video is great.  I love the songs.  They are funny and catchy to sing along with, and the video of the sea animals are great.  I had lent my first copy to someone and had to order another because I didn't get it back.  That's how much I really liked this DVD.",1401753600,,264,3.9245283018867925
2664313,5,B000IZECRO,"Hi everyone, this DVD is beautifully done.  If your class is studying Sea Life I would suggest buying this product.  I am a music teacher and the CD is great too.",1382227200,,162,4.193548387096774

2664316,5,B000IZECRO,"My kids love it, they have been watching it since they were a baby, and still at 3years old enjoy it and ask me to put it back on!",1357516800,,130,3.5172413793103448
2664317,4,B000IZECRO,"We don't watch a lot of DVDs, but my kids like this one.  It's surprising to me that they do, but they love to watch the fish.  They love seeing the manatee, actually, and the lobsters. They really wanted their grandmother to come see the video and see the lobsters!

This dvd is basically Brent Holmes' album Sea Tunes for Kids set against the backdrop of sea life.  There are all sorts of fish in the video.  My kids just loved to watch them all move.  I think this DVD is best for kids ages 2-5, but kids 6 and 7 would enjoy it too.  It isn't especially education in and of itself, but if you discuss the fish and identify them with your child, they could learn a lot from it.  It would also be very soothing to watch if your child was sick in bed and couldn't be active.",1354060800,,774,4.079470198675497
2664318,5,B000IZECRO,"My 3 yr old son calls this his ""quiet fish"" DVD.  We also have Finding Nemo, but he has yet to watch it since he loves this DVD so much more. He is learning all the names of the fish/sea animals, and the songs are nice and catchy.",1301961600,,230,3.7916666666666665

2664321,5,B000IZECRO,"I saw this dvd at a specialty store and was interested but the price was too high. I went to Amazon and found what I wanted at a price I wanted.
