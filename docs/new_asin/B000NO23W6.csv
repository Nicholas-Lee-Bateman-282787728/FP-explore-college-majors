2772752,5,B000NO23W6,This is such a great show!  Both Adam and Jamie's personalities totally make it!  Each episode is them exploring whether or not certain myths are even plausible.  But it's their approach that makes this show a winner!  I highly recommend getting the whole series!  (You can also catch current episodes on the Discovery Channel on Wednesday nights!),1200787200,,348,5.035087719298246
2772753,4,B000NO23W6,"I found it strange that there is no list of episodes, but decided to order the set anyway. I wasn't disappointed: there is some great classic stuff in this set. The episodes are 1 - 6, 34, 36, 37, 40 and 43 and the shop till you drop and MythBusters revealed specials. [...] There doesn't seem to be any region coding on the DVDs.

The episodes look very good, but sometimes I got the impression that the material wasn't filmed with widescreen viewing in mind, the framing can be on the claustrophobic side. (I.e., zoomed in a bit too far.) The earlier episodes have the myths one after the other, and you can select which one you want to watch. This is great. Unfortunately, in the later episodes we get the more familiar interweaving of the myths so you only get to select the beginning of the myth you want to watch but when the program switches to another myth you have to fast forward manually, there are no additional chapter stops.",1199750400,51,938,4.453488372093023
2772754,5,B000NO23W6,"Product arrived in a very timely manner and appears to be brand new and in good condition - DVD is a gift, therefore I'm not going to open it. The mailing packaging, however, could have been chosen better: the window to allow for viewing of the address on the paper inside was OPEN and not covered by see-through plastic. Such packaging could allow for damage to the product inside. Other than the packaging, I am VERY HAPPY with my purchase!",1198368000,,442,4.5375
2772755,5,B000NO23W6,"Mythbusters is a great show for everyone! The hosts, along with their team, crack myths and urban legends using science. This DVD Set is a great value for the money. 4 Discs for $20. I also found it was much cheaper than the Boxed versions sold on the discovery channel site which retailed for $50 each. The show is funny and you will learn from it whether you realize at the time or not. Great for kids, teenagers and adults. I feel like it is a parallel to the fun science shows of my youth like ""Bill Nye the Science Guy"".",1196035200,5,525,4.207920792079208

2772757,5,B000NO23W6,"I've waited a long time for some of these favorite episodes to come out in a collection, to make my mind up if I wanted to buy everything year by year or on iTunes.  This Collection has many of my favorite episodes, but is not inclusive, so I'll buy the years as they become available.  Go Mythbusters!",1182816000,6,302,4.280701754385965
2772758,5,B000NO23W6,"Ahh, the Mythbusters: if you haven't stumbled upon this show on the Discovery Channel yet, what are you waiting for?  Over the years, Adam and Jamie (and Tory, Grant, and Kari) have thoroughly tackled some of our greatest urban myths, legends, and simply bizarre ideas, using their vast areas of knowlege in the sciences.  Watching an episode is like watching the scientific method at work, and the personalities of Adam and Jamie make the show extremely entertaining.  The projects they do are great for kids to see (although sometimes their language might not be appropriate for young people, depending on how uptight you are about that sort of thing) because they show how working through a problem can lead to very interesting results.  I've learned a lot by watching this show.

This DVD set is very bare-bones.  Only one behind-the-scenes feature, no commentaries, just full-length episodes (I think there may be some extra footage thrown in here and there; there are a couple small experiments that I don't remember seeing from the TV version).  Plus, the episodes they chose for the set seem kind of arbitrary, just random ones from seasons 2 and 3.  However, the new low price is MUCH better than the $60 or so you used to have to pay at the Discovery Channel website.  I recommend this set to anyone who has ever been curious about their world.  You will not be disappointed.",1182038400,32,1385,4.805907172995781
2772771,5,B000NO23W6,"Trying to find a present for my grand nephew is so difficult.  He is 11 years old and loves to download apps for everything.  The other night I asked my nephew what my GN was doing as he was so quiet.  Lo and behold he was watching 'Mythbusters' which I had never heard about.  My nephew told me he absolutely loved the show.

My dilemma of Christmas shopping was solved and if there are any problems when he receives it will update this review.

Most highly recommended.",1449187200,3,471,4.35632183908046

Consider - the lovely quiet Jamie Hyneman and the eclectically loud and funny Adam Savage, THE MYTHBUSTERS plus (their beautiful and wonderful staff of Mythbusters: Kari Byron, Jessi Combs, Grant Imahara, Tory Belleci, Robert Lee, Nikos Andronikos and so forth...)
I saw one of their TV Show Seasons and I've purchased all of their TV Show Seasons available for sale, plus all of the 10 Collections and All of their Specials.

Since you cannot list more than 10 inserted recommendations, there are SEVERAL

I recommend buying the s-e-v-e-n [numbered] collections-- NOT seasons --like I did.
I bought some from AMAZON, and others when I saw them on the shelves of
the PX I work at.
Buy them here... some of the early collections are either unavailable,
or outragiously-priced.

2772788,5,B000NO23W6,"I like the MythBusters a lot.  They are pretty wholesome intertainment and you get to discover a few science facts when watching them.  There are more bleeped out words in the first episodes where as now there is no cursing but other than that, great, classic MythBusters stuff!",1306972800,,278,4.770833333333333
2772789,5,B000NO23W6,"The premise of the show is well documented. Two special effects experts and their staff take on common myths (and many not so common) and subject them to the scientific method.

The principals are all personable and obviously enjoy this work. That is important to the success of the show. Without their enthusiasm some of the things they film could be quite dry.

Whether exploring household myths such as whether it is safe to eat a piece of food that drops on the floor, or exploring tactics used in movies, you'll learn a lot and have fun doing it.

2772791,5,B000NO23W6,"I was never that interested in science and technology, which made school rather boring and even a little difficult. I wish I had found this show sooner! Jamie and Adam explain the details in a way people of all ages and learning can understand, and they make even the most disgusting/weird topics intriguing. They mainly handle urban legends, but have expanded in recent years to include internet videos and real life incidents.

Adam (a bit ""goofier"") and Jamey (more dead pan) work perfectly together mixing an entertaining blend of humor and science in trying to find out whether a ""myth"" is real or not. And often the experiments are things we would all like to try, but don't, for good reason.

It is a great show for older (mature) children to watch with adults.

2772797,4,B000NO23W6,"As a 14 year-old, so-called pyromaniac, this show hits the spot for me, just not this season. If you are like me, and watch the discovery channel, hoping that some ship will sink on The Deadliest Catch, or that Bear Grylles will finally fall to his well-deserved doom on Man vs. Wild, this show is just the same. I personally watch this show hoping to see some amazing explosion that will break some Guinness-World-Record for the largest explosion held by some Russian guy whose name is harder to pronounce than an island in Indonesia. The truth about this season of Mythbusters is that things aren't as dramatic. Although the show gets much better as it matures, the first couple of episodes help the cast members find their comfort zone, and this makes the show MUCH more enjoyable. On the debate on weather-or-not to buy the box set, I say buy it.",1211932800,7,850,4.635761589403973

We really liked the Mythbusters series when we first saw them, but after Scotty left the build team and Carrie became the only woman, she got really annoying IMHO - very ""cutesy.""  After a while the ""clever interactions"" - particularly from the era of the Build Team - seemed to take the focus over from the actual science, and we just got tired of it, especially when they wouod do things just to be mean to each other. What kind of role mode is that? But, we still did enjoy the science part.
