7805492,5,6300213463,I was happy to find a vhs that was in good condition.  It came at a good price and was delivered timely.  Now I have my favorite episode of Star Trek.,1383609600,,150,3.806451612903226
7805493,3,6300213463,"This episode may be a little silly but it's Star Trek and
fans would probably want to have it. A travelling salesman sells
""tribbles"" which are harmless little furry creatures. The problem is that he doesn't mention how fast they multiply. The Klingons
are also involved in the show.",1284768000,,283,4.795918367346939
7805494,5,6300213463,"""The Trouble With Tribbles"" might not be the best Star Trek episode, but it is certainly the funniest.  The Enterprise rushes to Deep Space Station K-7 only to find a pretentious bureaucrat named Nilz Baris who wants Kirk to protect tons of quadrotriticale, a hybrid grain that will be used to colonize Sherman's planet.  Kirk is ticked off that Baris misused the Priority 1 Distress Call and only allots two guards to watch the ""wheat"".  Meanwhile the rest of the ship gets shore leave and Uhura meets Cyrano Jones, a trader of curious items, including the amazing Tribble, the creature that is apparently born pregnant (one of Bones' best all-time diagnoses).  While the little beasties threaten to overwhelm the ship, Kirk has to deal with some unhappy Klingons, reprimand Scotty for defending the ship's honor in a bar room brawl with the Klingons, and try to protect all that wheat, er, quadrotriticale.  Watching a clearly peeved Kirk deal with all these headaches is a hoot, as is the classic moment when he has to endure a shower of Tribbles.  Plus there is the sight of Spock petting a Tribble and Scotty ending the episode with the all-time greatest pun in Star Trek history.  They must have had a total blast doing this one.
David Gerrold, who wrote this episode, also wrote one of the more interesting Star Trek non-fiction books detailing how he came to write the episode and how his script came to be filmed.  An excellent behind-the-scenes book for aspiring Star Trek writers. If you love this episode, then you owe it to yourself to also check out not only Gerrold's book but the Deep Space 9 episode ""Trials and Tribbulations,"" where Sisko, Worf, O'Brien and Bashir go back in time and re-live the original Star Trek episode to preserve the time-line.  That episode is worth it just for the double-take everybody does when they see how different Worf looks like from the ""original"" Klingons.  That episode was definitely my type of homage.  Oh, and the ""sequel"" on ""Star Trek: The Animated Series"" was that the best episode of that short-lived cartoon series as well.",1005696000,4,2084,4.809523809523809
7805495,4,6300213463,"I will say up front that I was never a fan of the original series.  The only character than ever made sense to me was Spock.  However, the Tribbles were the best alien creature the original series had and this episode is Star Trek Gold.",996969600,,236,4.222222222222222
7805496,4,6300213463,"The Starship Enterprise receives an urgent signal from spac-station K-7 nearby a planet on the verge of colonization by the ferderation.  The planet's proximity to the nuetral zone means that the likelihood that the insidious Klingons will try to saboutage the federation's efforts is high.  The klingons want this planet badly or at least to deny it to the Federation.  Key to the federation's plan is quadrotritacale, a kind of super-wheat which, when cultivated, will allow the Federation colonists an essential degree of self-sufficiency.  The wheat stockpiles aboard K-7, therefore, is worth more than its weight in gold and is presumably a prime target for the expected Klingon saboutage.
From such a tense opening, the writers fashion one of the most slyly funny hours of science fiction TV.  Now partly overshadowed by the technicolor campiness that has colored most of 60's cult TV.  Though the Klingons put in an appearance, the true threat turns about to be the Tribbles - fuzzy little creatures that out-multiply rabbits.  Quickly overruning both K-7 and the Enterprise, the seemingly innocuous tribbles become less innocuous as time goes by, and may do the Klingons' work for them.
Everything about this episode pre-figures the endless years of Trek parodies - and surpasses them all in an endless stream (within an hour anyway) of comic moments - like Kirk buried under a mountain of dead tribbles, Mr. Scott being baited into a fight by Klingons (he keeps his cool when they heap insults about Kirk, but when the Klingons put down the Enterprise, Scott goes ""Braveheart"" on their entire crew), or the way the cute tribbles are friendly to everybody except Klingons.  Even the casting is inspired, with William Schalert as the uptight Federation bureaucrat, and William Campbell as the ominous Klingon commander.  (Campbell played the gleefully omnipotent Trelane in the ""Squire of Gothos"", an emotionally premature homicidal, otherworldly superbeing who enjoyed violent behavior.  The role seems to clash with the coldly insistent Klingon, but Campbell hints at the fun he could have).
This episode proves why the original series will never be surpassed by any of the next-generation versions, which are populated with its emotionally correct and protacol-ruled officers and figures.",996019200,2,2298,5.271232876712329
7805497,5,6300213463,"Even people who barely know what Star Trek is have seen or heard of this episode.  ""Tribble"" has become a household word.  This episode is hilariously funny, expecially if you know the characters.  It is generally regarded as the funniest episode in the series.  Although it is not my favorite, I love this episode, and highly recommend it. The Enterprise answers a distress call and travels to a space station, where the crew dicovers that there is no emergency.  The space station has just recieved a shipment of a new, highly dvanced grain, and the powers-that-be want it guarded.  Kirk is, needless to say, very annoyed.  Add to that a Klingon ship requesting ""shore-leave rights,"" and a trader selling cute little balls of fluff called Tribbles. Humans instictively like them, but Klingons do not.  Once one Tribble is brought on board the Enterprise, it begins mulitplying so rapidly that it becomes a source of concern to Kirk and Spock.  There is no better combination for a funny episode.",982972800,8,997,4.886904761904762
7805498,4,6300213463,"Robert Heinlein wrote about Martian flat cats in his book ""The Rolling Stones"".  What a pleasant surprise when I saw how the flat cats had been resurrected as Tribbles in Star Trek.  Of course, the Stones family managed to sell off the flat cats to lonely miners in the Asteroid Belt, while Capt. Kirk used Tribbles to find Klingons.  Overall a great laugh in either incarnation.",981417600,2,379,4.712121212121212
7805499,2,6300213463,This episode consistently ranks #1 on top ten polls of the original series but it does not deserve this distiction.  The only good element in this episode is the character interaction but that's it!  The story is very  light-hearted and has no drama and little action.  I would say that this  episode's popularity is the greatest mystery in the Star Trek universe!,930009600,3,364,4.806451612903226
