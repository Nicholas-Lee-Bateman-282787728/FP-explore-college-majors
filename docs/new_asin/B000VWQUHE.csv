8220286,4,B000VWQUHE,"We have watched two of the DVDs in this series. There is a lot of good, educational information in them. I like that they are narrated and hosted by a woman who is a Native American herself.
First we watched the ""comparing the lives of native peoples"" and then watched the ""native peoples of the woodlands."" The kids were annoyed by the repetition of facts from the first DVD.",1299369600,,376,4.463768115942029
