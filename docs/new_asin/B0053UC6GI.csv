4552479,4,B0053UC6GI,I love the Virtual Active DVD's. I like that they give you the option to work out to a guide or without one. Love the opportunity to travel the world right from my treadmill. This one is very nice,1388707200,,196,4.051282051282051
4552480,3,B0053UC6GI,"This video has good visuals and switches around enough to keep you from becoming bored, but the music is awful.",1361145600,,111,4.6
4552481,2,B0053UC6GI,"I was hoping for a video that would incorporate both the hiking experience as well as ability to look around and see the sights.  Was trying this one out to see - and gave it as a gift to my friend who does treadmilliing.  he rfeedback was that it does the hiking part and has different intensity levels, but basically you are just looking where you walk.  Occassionally you stop and look around a view - but not nearly often enough.  So the things that would make it special - ie the local views - aren't presented well.",1361059200,,521,4.285714285714286
4552482,5,B0053UC6GI,"I just received this product today and I immediately tried it out with my new electronic stepper that I got today as well.  This was an excellent product.  As people have mentioned in reviews, it does jump around, but it wasn't distracting at all to me.  Instead I was just looking forward to what I would see next and it kept me interested in what was going on.  I've tried two other dvds like this one including the Scenic Trex Beachside Jungle and the Trek Ireland Explore the Valley of Glendalough and the Northern Italy Hike was the best. The pace of the hike is like a fast walk and it feels a tiny bit like you're gliding, but it felt really natural with my stepper.  It was great to see all the changing scenery and the people.  I also enjoyed the music.  It was kind of techno with a great beat.  I tried the guided hike and I liked the tips and the workout guidelines that pop up on the screen every so often. Plus Johnny is cute, which is always a plus.  The one recommendation that I would suggest is to order the downloads off the Virtual Active website because you get a much better price especially with the bundles.  Also, Johnny Pearman has a free run download code on his facebook page.  It was so fun I'm definitely expanding my collection of Virtual Active hikes.",1354665600,2,1283,4.348739495798319
4552483,5,B0053UC6GI,Love this DVD - makes me feel like I'm back in Italy!  Great camera work - make the time go very quickly.  Will order again!,1336780800,2,124,3.92
4552484,5,B0053UC6GI,"I have four of the virtual active hiking videos and I could not be happier with them!  They make treadmill time go by really fast with beautiful scenery that makes you feel like you are there!  And, if you need an extra push, Johnny is right there to help!  I plan to collect the whole series.",1334534400,3,293,4.196428571428571
4552485,5,B0053UC6GI,"I just finished working out with Virtual Active - Northern Italy Hike. I varied my workout with several different pieces of equipment; Precor AMT (my favorite), bike, etc.

I think it's about 35 minutes, but I don't think that counts cool down. I wanted a longer workout, so I just did it again a different way.

If you love the idea of hiking through different parts of Italy, I think you will love this DVD.

We started on a tiny path through the Alps. We went to Venice. We visited the biggest lake in Italy, a small Italian town, and a national park. I'm talking quaint seaside villages, charming lakes, just anything you could imagine. We may have seen more than many tourists because we went places tourists rarely go, and some places that they do.

My workout time just went by so fast it surprised me.

I did the workout the first time with commentary and the second time through in what they called ""Basic Hike"" mode where you don't hear anything but the natural sounds, no commentary. I like both.

In fact, I don't think I've had a more delightful virtual workout! Tomorrow I hope to do Northern Italy RUN. I can't imagine that it won't be just as wonderful.",1331596800,7,1169,4.490566037735849
8455788,4,B0053UC6GI,I love it but it needs to be downloadable vs DVD,1489017600,,48,3.4545454545454546
8455789,5,B0053UC6GI,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
8455790,5,B0053UC6GI,Excellent! This is perfect for the treadmill; love the Northern Italy Run video also.  This has different views. Very happy with my purchase.,1455926400,,141,5.130434782608695
8455791,5,B0053UC6GI,Love it,1447545600,,7,3.0
8455792,5,B0053UC6GI,This is a lovely hike. It is great to hop on my treadmill and enjoy the lovely views of Northern Italy. The time goes by so fast and my workouts are easier than I would have believed.,1435536000,,183,3.972972972972973
8455793,5,B0053UC6GI,"I love the challenge of the steeper hills. I like the crowd scenes; good for counting blue shirts, backpacks, etc. Music is ""eh."" I will look for some more from this company.",1413158400,,174,4.46875
8455794,4,B0053UC6GI,I've only used this once because I haven't had it very long but the video & narration was enjoyable to watch while working out. He didn't talk too much and when he did it was encouraging. I like the option to turn off the guided tour and just enjoy the scenery if wanted. It makes you want to plan a vacation in Italy!,1409702400,,318,4.063492063492063
8455795,5,B0053UC6GI,This is beautiful and well done. I just never get tired of it,1405814400,,61,3.769230769230769
8455796,4,B0053UC6GI,"Great job.  I enjoy the evening walks.  I feel that the pace of this one is a bit much for an order person or beginner.  Also, it would be nice to have it in sections in order to choose the walks and not start-over for the whole program.  I enjoy the scenery and would love a few breaks to view the panorama.  The Venice walk was very disappointing;  too short and too fast.",1405209600,,374,4.054794520547945
8455797,5,B0053UC6GI,"This DVD was very well done!  I have been to Venice and also the Cinque Terre Hike and I can tell you Virtual Active did it justice!  Johnny Pearlman is good too as a trainer.  He is not overly invasive in the DVD, just enough  Also, great music, motivating .  Loved the different paths that were chosen as well.  Makes me want to order the whole line of Virtual Active!",1391558400,,370,4.214285714285714
