8275220,2,B0019SX8CO,"Spanish dialog. A modernized version of the classic Mexican ""LLORONA"" folk tale. Story line seems to be a compilation of two Mexican and American folk tales. The American, Lady in white tale and the Mexican,  Wailing woman tale. Special effects and acting by the characters in the movie left much to to desired. This movie will disappoint. Do not buy it, if you must see it find it as a rental.",1282089600,,394,4.549295774647887
8275221,5,B0019SX8CO,"A native New Mexican, growing up in a Hispanic family, the tale of La Llorona is second nature to me.  Children of this area grow up fearing La Llorona rather than the traditional monsters such as ""The Boogeyman"" or other various ghost stories meant to scare children.  Constantly looking for films that depict a frightful representation of the legendary ""Weeping Woman"", I have purchased multiple films regarding her and the various alternative forms of her urban legend.

Where does Kilometro 31 land when compared to other films that focus on La Llorona?  It does quite well.  The story takes place in Mexico where we are greeted with the opening scene of a woman driving on an old highway.  The night is present and fog begins to gather rapidly, making it difficult to see the road.  As a result, Agata (the driver of the vehicle) is not able to avoid hitting a small child who was standing in the middle of the road.  After inspecting the child for any vital signs, the child disappears, leaving Agata alone in the street to fall victim of a car accident.

Agata ends up in a hospital, where she is medically treated and left maimed and in a coma from the brutality of the accident.  Her twin sister, Catalina, and her two friends Nuoz and Omar are there to hear the doctor deliver this bad news to them.  Upon visiting Agata's room, Catalina is greeted with haunting feelings and disturbing images.  She is also sharing a psychic link with her twin sister, feeling her pain as she lays helplessly on the hospital bed, trapped between life and death.

While traveling the highway one night, Catalina, Nuoz and Omar encounter a similar scenario, when they hit an older woman who was standing in the middle of the street.  The cop assigned to the investigation lets the three off the hook and tells them that this is a normal, reoccurring event on this highway.  He presents multiple files to Omar, all of which point to a dramatic conclusion: these accidents are the result of La Llorona and her child, both of which died hundreds of years ago by drowning in a river, a river that happened to be located on the exact marker on the highway where these events keep occurring, marker KM31.

With disturbing images that build suspense and dramatic scenes reminiscent of Japanese horror films such as ""Ju-On"" and ""Ringu"", ""Kilometro 31"" delivers the same level of intensity as the films of which it resembles.  Scenes of ghostly apparitions are frequent, with ghosts communicating through eerie whispers and worldly objects such as televisions and water.  ""Kilometro 31"" is a film that is bound to keep the viewer full of suspense with every scene.  With twists and turns adding to the dilemma and suspense as the film progresses, the chills are continuous throughout the entire viewing experience.  As Catalina, Nuoz and Omar continue to fight for the truth behind the incidents on the highway, they begin to find themselves entrapped in something much darker, and much eviler than what they intended.  The dramatic conclusion, and the final scene, leaves the viewer with goosebumps.

Amazing acting (with English subtitles and Spanish acting), coupled with dark, foreboding atmospheres, make this film worth checking out if you're a horror film fanatic.  The film contains plenty of creepy images and ""jump"" moments that are sure to fulfill anyone's horror movie fix.  ""Kilometro 31"" is a movie that simply cannot be overlooked for anyone who's a fan of traditional Japanese style horror films.",1278892800,,3495,4.864864864864865
8275222,4,B0019SX8CO,"A good Mexican movie is hard to come by these days, this is one creepy movie!!  The ending could have been better but all in all, worth the price paid through Amazon:)",1274140800,,167,4.21875
8275223,3,B0019SX8CO,"Speaking about Km 31 (kilometer 31) requires to talk about 2 things: technical merit and a good story.

Technical merit. For a Mexican movie, ""Km 31"" has a great production, an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 sound that made me believe for a moment that someone was whispering to my right ear -I'm an horror movie die hard fan and not get scared easily-, until I realized it was the right sourround speaker. The movie uses a grayish green filter -a la ""Dark Water"" that uses a green one- that sets a cold and dark mood, it even has computer generated special effects. Those things are not new in Holliwood movies, but in Mexico this is a step toward a serious effort in delivering quality horror productions to audiences.

Story. Although the story is not completely original, it uses an element that adds originality and freshness: ""La Llorona"" (the crying woman), a classic Mexican folklore tale about a female specter that wanders the streets at night.

In the final balance, Km 31 it's a very good horror movie, it's a gripping and oscure spine chilling tale.",1261872000,,1059,4.713513513513513
8275224,5,B0019SX8CO,"This movie is easily reminiscent of the J-Horror movies that have been taking the horror movie world by storm. The only difference is that this film is from Mexico and not Asia. ""KM 31"" or Kilometer 31 is a scary, moody, chilling, and well done movie. To say the least it topped box-office records in Mexico. As I watched it, it reminded me of Ju-on and The Ring. However, without giving too much, the movie takes a fresh spin at an old Mexican Folklore tale about a woman and her lost children.

Although it is obvious that the director was inspired by such movies as Dark Water and the previously mentioned Ju-On and The Ring, ""KM 31"" manages to stay fresh and new especially because it tackles such a huge and popular Latin myth.

What is also great and impressive about this movie is the high production value. Not only is ""KM 31"" well shot, but it continues the amazing and stylish visuals that have been coming out of Mexico with directors such as Guillermo Del Toro (The Devil's Backbone) and Alfonso Cuarn (Harry Potter III).

This movie is destined to become a Mexican horror classic and beyond alongside such movies as ""Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo"", ""The Devil's Backbone"", ""Ju-on"" and ""The Ring"".

Synopsis:

Soon after a mysterious car accident involving a little boy on Kilometer 31, Agata falls into a coma. Catalina, thanks to their link, feels the pain and tragedy that her sister is going through. Following a series of supernatural events, Catalina realizes that their link is stronger than ever and that her sister Agata is screaming for help and trying to warn her about a sinister presence.

Catalina is now determined at all cost to find out what really happened to her sister in order to help her wake from her coma. Nuo, Catalina's long time friend, and Omar, Agata's boyfriend, agree to help her. But they all soon find out that not only is Agata in a coma, but that there are otherworldly and supernatural elements present. Both sisters soon find themselves trapped between reality and the curse of an old and ancient Mexican legend!",1224201600,,2260,4.737913486005089
