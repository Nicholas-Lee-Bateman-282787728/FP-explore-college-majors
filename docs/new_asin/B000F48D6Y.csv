I'm by no means a great bellydancer - so if you are advanced, this may not be as challenging as you would like.  But Rania breaks down the moves well, and I like the outdoor courtyard setting.  No offense to the background dancers, but at some points they just looked kind of silly, like they were a little sloppy on technique?  But I was focusing on Rania anyway.  There is some kind of background noise....I hope it wasn't traffic whooshing by, that would be kind of funny, I just thought of it as an ""ocean waves"" sound to keep the mood pleasant.  I was never good at following choreography, so having a simple yet fun and lovely little choreography that even I could learn to follow was great, all while getting a workout!",1440201600,,823,4.453333333333333
8117095,5,B000F48D6Y,"Love this dvd! Great instruction, great location, great music! A favourite in my rotation, I use it and/or it's choreography regularly. After learning the routine, I tried it to a variety of music, being careful not to sacrifice form and found it worked with many tempos. Sometimes it's slow, sometimes it's very fast! I can easily reach my training zone and enjoy a nice 10-60 minute dance session (depending on my schedule) whether I'm home or not. I like the flow of the steps, the variety of levels and moves-upper body and lower body. When my dance time is over, I always feel that it's been a balanced whole body workout. Thank you Rania !",1425081600,,645,4.6173913043478265
8117096,5,B000F48D6Y,"Hard to find and in great shape!  I used this constantly, it does a great deal of good and its so simple, low in impact. It was well packaged for safe delivery!  Thanks, Suzette",1381363200,,177,4.176470588235294
8117097,5,B000F48D6Y,"This workout was filmed in a beautiful outdoor courtyard. The format of the workout is easy to follow. What I like the most about it is that Rania goes through each set of moves individually before combining them. (That makes it so much easier than when she repeats a set every time she gives you another set, like she does in other workouts.) I would say that Rania explains the moves efficiently without going into undue detail. If you are an absolute beginner, though, she does  throw in some things suddenly, like a figure 8, and you just have to follow along. I don't think it would be too difficult, though, for people with no experience with bellydance workouts to catch on. I have a large Rania collection and I think this workout is even more fun for a beginner than her others.

Just so you know, the outfit she is wearing on the cover is nothing like the outfit she wears on the video, but that's a minor irritation, since the one on the inside of the DVD is prettier anyway. The biggest irritation is that the cameraman just couldn't get it into his head that close-ups on Rania are not helpful in an instructional DVD. He even focused on her face in the middle of the workout for long periods of time, which meant that when you're trying to follow along, you could easily get lost. Save the close-ups for when she's introducing the video, not for when she's dancing! And then again in the performance section the cameraman went a little wild filming it from odd angles and inserting close-ups again. Truly, the performance is part of the instruction, so her entire body needs to be in the shot. Even when it looks great to see her dancing behind the fountain, it would look better to see her entire body, not just part of her.

That said, this went immediately into my stack of favorite bellydance DVDs along with Cocktail by Tanna because the workout is fun.",1329177600,2,1872,4.5
8117098,5,B000F48D6Y,Rania's chill & friendly approach will encourage you to get into bellydancing and stick with it. I have repeatedly gone back to her video materials since 2004.,1325980800,,159,4.925925925925926

8117101,2,B000F48D6Y,"The vidio was ok showing the introductory moves but the dance portion of the vidio wasn't very good.  The moves looked silly.

At the end of the vidio it shows the instructor dancing.  If I had seen this portion of the vidio first I wouldn't have bought the DVD.  She looked like a novice to me.",1198454400,5,295,4.214285714285714
8117102,5,B000F48D6Y,"I bought this product from Ross for $4.99 just to see what it would be like, and it's actually pretty good. This is actually the first belly dance aerobic workout video that Rania made (at least that's what they said on her website).

The background setting is nice. The location is outside, and appears to be produced in a garden area. Rania is accompanied by two other dancers, who are all wearing coordinated blue outfits.

Throughout the routine, all the dancers have a serious look on their faces. They are not grinning and smiling at you the entire time. As a person who uses exercise dvd's on a regular basis, I like this feature becasue to me, too much smiling is a sign of being overly phoney.

Level: Beginner or Beginner-Intermediate

The dvd contains the following:

Beginning: Starts with showing you a part of a performance by Rania, and then moves into Rania telling you basically about the dvd.

Warm-up (about 20 minutes)

* Basic hand undulations and snake arms
* Shoulder shimmy practice
* Rib slides and abdominal and stomach exercises
* Chest lifts and undulations (e.g., The Camel)
* Hip Streches, Hip drops, hip drops with a kick, and travel with hip  drops
* Step Twist Movements
* Egyptian Walk
* Shimmy (using knees)and choo-choo (shimmy on tippy toes)

Cominations 1, 2, and 3 with cool down (about 19 to 20 minutes)

Note: Rania teaches combinations 1, 2, and 3 seperately, and then at the end, she puts them together in a dance routine.

Combo 1

* Step Twist while traveling (with arms)
* Hip Drop (while walking)
* Shoulder Shimmy
* Grapevine
* Step Twist (with turn)

Combo 2

* Rib Slides
* Snake Arms (while turning)
* Hip movement (while turning)
* Reverse Camel
* Hip drop with a Kick
* Egyptian Walk

Combo 3

* Camels
* Horizontial Figure Eight
* Shimmy (with knees)
* Choo-Choo (shimmy on tippy toes)
* Step Twist (while traveling)
* Basic Turns

Rania reviews each combination several times so that you can learn the moves. There are not many pauses inbetween learning the combos, so once you learn the routine well, it can be a good workout (for a beginner or beginner-intermediate). The moves are not difficult to learn, but for me, I am still working on my pathetic camel (smiles).

The menu selection on this dvd is basic. It's not highly interactive, but you can make some choices.

This dvd also comes with a performance by Rania. I really enjoyed this performance! The music is lively, and although many people feel that Rania dances like a robot, I did not find that to be the case with this performance. I have watched this performance several times, and therefore, I am quite impressed with the way she moves and dances.

Overall, I really enjoy this dvd. I've had it for over a month, and I use it regually in my rotation of other exercise dvd's. It's good to use for a different change of pace from regular/typical aerobics. Since I exercise 6 days a week for an average of 50 to 70 minutes a day, a new change in dance style is nice. I would definately reccommend buying this dvd, but if you are more advanced, I don't think it will be challenging enough for you.

Tip: You can probably find this at Ross for $4.99. I have seen several of these dvd's at Ross in my area (California). I would try Ross first before buying it somewhere else for a more expensive price.",1187827200,19,3319,4.54453781512605
