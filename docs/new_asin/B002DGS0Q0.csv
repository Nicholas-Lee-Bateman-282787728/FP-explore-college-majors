8365115,2,B002DGS0Q0,"This is an excellent instructional video. It has several exercises for the back and hips illustrated by an antimated figure. It also has illustrations of the different muscles showing where you will experience pain if you have problems with that particular muscle. The format is very tedious. You have to keep clicking on the individual exercises and muscle explanations which is very annoying and repetitive. I already have a list of exercises from the physical therapist to do. It is hard to remember which one to do next or did I do that one last time? I was expecting an exercise video that I could follow along and not have to keep referring back to the exercise sheet to know what to do next. If you already have been to a physical therapist and have a long list of exercises given to you by one or your doctor, then this video is probably not for you. If you have not been to a physical therapist or doctor and would like to learn some excellent stretches by someone who really knows their field then you may want to try this. Just keep in mind that this is instructional only. There is not an exercise routine to follow along with. Another reason I gave this only two stars is because of the failure of both Amazon and the creator to provide a clearer description of the dvd. Someone like me who was expecting an exercise video will be very disappointed. There are plenty of exercise videos out there but no physical therapy ones. With all of the Baby Boomers out there having knee and hip problems there is a great need for a physical therapy dvd. I would like to challenge Mary Smithson, creator of this tape to make a physical therapy stretching tape using a live person performing an exercise routine you can follow along too.",1384905600,3,1738,4.520634920634921

using this video.  This one is a keeper!",1366934400,,111,4.0

8365118,5,B002DGS0Q0,"I've bought several of these dvds (shoulders, neck, etc.)  They really work well, if you stick with them.

I would recommend.",1283817600,,125,4.904761904761905
8365119,3,B002DGS0Q0,"Why didn't they use a real human being to be in the video?

What I don't like about this video is that it is an animated ""person"" doing the exercises. Why don't they have a real person doing them? I think for any exercise or stretching video, people want to see a real person doing it. You can make an animated ""person"" do anything, even if it is not humanly possibly. So why trust an animated video?

I am going to keep looking around to find a video that actually has a real live person performing the exercises so I know they are indeed humanly possible and are safe and okay.

(what were they thinking??)",1282348800,4,608,4.269565217391304

My body became weak and stiff, and even though I walk, exercise regularly and eat right. Mary has helped me realize that stretching is the framework I was missing to make all the other healthy things I do more beneficial to my body. I purchased this DVD to stretch out my body and improve areas I have tension in - hips & lower back. I have been doing this DVD for 5 days and most of my pain is gone (I am so relieved after months of off and on dull pain), so this exactly what I needed.  This DVD gives you stretches, information on specific stretches and explains how to improve your range and why you have pain in certain areas.  This DVD would be well-suited to all levels of fitness and ages - I am 37. I have two parents in their 60s, and will purchase this DVD for them.  You can go to PT, but if you don't understand why you need to do the exercise and its health benefits, you won't continue.  She explains how to modify the stretches for older individuals and those have more serious pulls/pains. Mary stresses stretching to become a part of your daily lifestyle for maximum benefits.  I was impressed with Mary, because I emailed her to tell her how much I love the DVD and she responded same day and went on to give me useful information above and beyond the DVD.  A true professional in every way. I look forward to getting her other DVDs. Thank you Mary for your dedication!",1276819200,2,1492,4.291814946619217

The stretches presented here are aimed at the source of your low back pain ... to break the pain cycle and get your muscles working FOR you instead of AGAINST you.  Simple yet little-known stretches, clearly demonstrated to specifically address pack pain.  This is like a doctor in a DVD.",1253577600,3,409,4.561643835616438
