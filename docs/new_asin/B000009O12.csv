So, I decided to write a review cautioning others who may try to buy this disc on Blu-ray.  When I went to the page for this movie, it showed a ""Warning"" which said ""Playback Region B/2  :This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, ......"".  I don't recall seeing this warning when I purchased the movie.  Had I known about this problem, I would have purchased the DVD version even though it is a bit more expensive.  I don't know if Amazon will accept the return since it has been over 4 months (I have not checked but will ask them).",1507593600,,755,4.381294964028777

1197577,4,B000009O12,"The Fall of the Roman Empire is a period piece when it comes to special effects and in music. The plot, storyline and acting make up for the old-fashioned feel of the movie. Alec Guinness's portrayal of Emperor Marcus Aurelius is superb and Sophia Loren looks lovely in the movie. Other famous well respected actors found in the movie include James Mason and Omar Sharif. If you love old movies and classic storytelling you will love this movie.

The story is about the fall of the Roman Empire and is a tale we should pay attention to as if you don't learn from history the same mistakes will be made again.

1197578,5,B000009O12,I love the movie.  The actors are just great.  I remember the theatrical release and that time it was amazing to watch it in the movie theatre.  However it is a shame some scenes are missing on the DVD and it appears it was cut during  the scene showing  Commodus playing with the girl  ..  I don't know exactly which scenes are omitted but I remember parts of the 35 mm pellicule are missing.

1197582,5,B000009O12,"This is a tremendous work. Three hours long, it features a dozen of the finest actors of the 1950's - 1960's film era, a set that replicated the Roman Forum in both size and detail, over 16,000 extras, and amazing cinematography that rivals or is still better then great film work of today. If 3 hours is too long for most to get through, it is well worth taking in the immense scope of this work. This type of film will probably never be made again with CGI and all the digital computer effects that can be used now instead.
The title states this is about the fall of the Roman Empire, it is really a largely fictional depiction of the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and his corrupt and or possibly mad son Commodes. It covers the period that is the onset of the process of decline spanning several centuries after the death of Marcus Aurelius to 476 A. D. Other major characters are Lucilla, the sister of Commodes, and the general Livius (similar to the general Maximus in Gladiator). This film is much broader in scope than the newer Gladiator from 2000. It touches on how Marcus Aurelius actually lived on the German frontier much of his reign, and had a very permanent fortress complex there. A large portion of the film takes place in Germania. It shows the immense size of the Roman Army, and also how the provinces supplied troops to the Empire. It was really a huge commonwealth of nations in the 1st Century A. D. with many different cultures having joined Rome. While this film is typical of 1960's epics that have perfectly clean uniforms, clothes, streets, and buildings throughout, unlike the dirty realism of films today, this is still a must for anyone interested in ancient Rome. Another plus is the great historian Will Durant was a consultant on this work.",1491782400,,1782,4.571875

1197590,4,B000009O12,"The Fall of the Roman Empire"" is a very interesting movie! It may not appeal to everyone, but if it catches you, like it did me, it will provide an unforgettable experience. Its excellence is uneven and intermittent; you could say it is a flawed masterpiece. Your ability to tolerate and overlook its problems is key to enjoying it properly; set your expectations accordingly.

Its high points: The performance of Alec Guinness as Emperor Marcus Aurelius -- if you loved him in Star Wars, check him out here, he is essentially a similar character, an Obi Wan in an alternate universe: a simple person, a sensitive, intelligent man, shot through with a striking greatness that seems real and at the same time, curiously plain. Alec Guinness could pull that off and make it look easy. The performance of Christopher Plummer as Commodus, the film's antagonist, is delightful; his insanity is subtle, frightening, and at times quite humorous in a chilling way. The music by Dimitri Tiomkin is one of my all-time favorite scores, especially the Prelude heard during the film's beautiful main titles: awe-inspiring, stirring, once aptly described as ""black as night"", it can make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Some may feel the use of music is kind of old-fashioned, in that it punctuates and illustrates the drama in a didactic fashion that is not attempted in more modern films. The life-size, fairly accurate set of the Roman Forum, the largest set ever created for a motion picture according to Wikipedia, is a jaw-dropping spectacle, as is Marcus Aurelius's spooky fortress on the Danube. All the scenes that take place in the interior of this fortress are good, including Marcus's terrific, philosophical death scene. Almost all the sets are unusually well-done. Yes, Sophia Loren is lovely, and her wardrobe is beautiful and unusual. Anthony Mann's direction is often excellent, and his ability to film super-spectacular scenes with a camera that moves vertically on a crane is first-rate, giving a 3D effect that is more aesthetic than actual 3D movies. His handling of Marcus's dramatic, snowy funeral is amazing. The heart-stopping fight scene at the end of the film is one of the greatest combats ever filmed, close to the excellence of the fights in ""Spartacus"" and ""Troy"".

On the down-side, the film can seem dated at times. It is sometimes tedious, and badly paced in many spots, and some scenes are surprisingly lackluster or tasteless. The love story between Lucilla and Livius is contrived and seems incomplete or never properly imagined. The main character, Livius, seems strangely detached from reality, because his emotions are never fully explored; he seems almost like a cardboard cutout. The chariot duel, meant to be one of the film's central thrills, comes off as a pale imitation of the chariot race in ""Ben-Hur"". You may feel real confusion at where the story is going. The story gels and coheres more at the end, and gains momentum and intensity, but perhaps not enough to completely satisfy.

The script is superb in parts and a mess in others. You have to endure some mediocrity to get the good stuff. A central theme of the film, brutality versus compassion, comes through loud and clear, with piercing meaning for us today. Watching this film may make you feel us Americans are reliving the Fall of the Roman Empire in our own time. I found the ending of the film to be astonishing, surprising, unsettling, and thought-provoking.

I purchased the BlueRay version, with which I am incredibly happy; please try to see this film using this version. Original widescreen aspect ration, perfect image quality and color, glorious sound.

One other note for Star Wars fans: this film contains a scene which could very well have been the dramatic inspiration for the final confrontation of Han Solo and Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. See if you agree. Of course, ""Fall"" is the film that inspired ""Gladiator"", a much more modern and evenly scripted film.

As other reviews here have noted, there are some profound thoughts imbedded in this film, that are a delight to encounter and mull over, if you are the type to enjoy such things.

Give this movie a try. It has a unique charm that may just catch you. There are very good reasons why critics gave it a 100% score at Rotten Tomatoes. I believe it is really worth seeing; they don't make them like this anymore!",1473811200,,5222,5.001150747986191

One of the great screen epics, director Anthony Mann's Oscar nominated THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE comes to Blu-ray for the first time in this digitally remastered deluxe edition. The all-star cast includes Academy Award winners Sir Alec Guinness and Sophia Loren with Christopher Plummer, Stephen Boyd, James Mason and Omar Sharif. Drawn from the same events that later inspired the film Gladiator. The film charts the power-hungry greed and father-son betrayal that led to Rome's collapse at the bloody hands of the Barbarians. Featuring great sets, fine acting, and a thundering battle scenes. Plus a blistering chariot race rivalling that of BEN-HUR. This is a must-see epic full of the gore and glories of ancient Rome (Channel 4). Narrated by Robert Rietty.

FILM FACT: Awards and Nominations: Golden Globe Awards: Win: Best Original Score for Dimitri Tiomkin. Academy Awards: Nominated: Best Music Score for Dimitri Tiomkin [Substantially Original]. The Fall of the Roman Empire was one of Bronston's super-productions in Spain, with Marcus Aurelius's winter camp on the Danube shot in snow in the Sierra de Guadarrama, northern Madrid. The 'Battle of the Four Armies' involved 8,000 soldiers including 1,200 cavalry and was shot on an undulating plain at Manzanares el Real which allowed large numbers of soldiers to be visible over a long distance. The film's reconstruction of the Roman Forum at Las Matas near Madrid, at 400 x 230 meters (1312 x 754 feet) holds the record for the largest outdoor film set. The various ancient Rome settings covered 55 acres (220,000 m2).

Andrews Blu-ray Review: How do you adapt a six volume historical work that spans 1200 years for the screen? It was a question many critics had for director Anthony Mann when he took on the challenge of making THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE [1964] and based on Edward Gibbon's acclaimed work, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Although Edward Gibbon's epic narrative spanned from 200 AD to the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Anthony Mann chose to concentrate on the first 300 years. Many factors led to the decline of the Roman Empire, too many, in fact, to cover adequately in a 172 minute feature, but Anthony Mann focuses on the political power shift that eventually resulted in the invasion of the Barbarians and the rise of Christianity, two factors which ended Roman domination of the civilized world.

The film opens during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (AD 121-180) as he considers a successor to his throne. Instead of choosing his own son Commodus [Christopher Plummer] to succeed him, Aurelius [Sir Alec Guinness] favours his adopted son, Livius [Stephen Boyd], a decision which is never made official because of the emperor's premature death. Instead, Commodus proclaims himself Emperor and Livius, his boyhood friend, pledges his support and is appointed Commander of the Army. But where Aurelius made a humane and philosophical leader, Commodus proves himself to be a rash and irresponsible one. Eventually his tyranny alienates Livius who ends up siding with Lucilla [Sophia Loren], Commodus's sister and the wife of the Armenian King, Sohamus [Omar Sharif]. The power struggle between Commodus and Livius culminates in the latter leading the Barbarians against the Romans with a decisive javelin duel to the death between the emperor and his former army commander.

Ask anyone who knows about THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, and their response is sure to include the word ""sumptuous."" From back in the day when epic meant upwards of 10,000 extras, gargantuan sets, and 122-piece orchestras, Anthony Mann's 1964 consolation prize after being fired from 1960's Spartacus is filled with literal pageantry: parades of troops in authentic costumes and plenty of heraldic ceremony.

It's unusual for a set to be a film's greatest achievement, but here is an unusual set, shepherded by the great Veniero Colasanti and John Moore, partners in production design, set decoration, and costume design. The Roman Forum was completely constructed: 27 structures over seven months, down to the cobblestones and statuary. In other words, CGI is for wimps. No backdrops, no matte paintings, no facades, this was a three-dimensional scale replica. Aside from the jaw-dropping sets and costumes, The Fall of the Roman Empire is a pretty decent classic film in its own right, sometimes overripe or stodgily stolid, but in its fictionalised way acknowledging the complicated political pressures that worked against the empire.

Mann was also a big advocate of filming on location because he discovered early on that unpredictable occurrences due to weather or some uncontrollable factor could actually result in an inspired cinema moment. ""For instance,"" he recalled, ""I had always thought for Roman Empire, I would love to do the death of Marcus Aurelius in the snow. One morning I woke up and it was really snowing. So I called everybody early and I got them up there and I said: 'I know it's freezing to death here, but we'll put you in warm tents and we're going to do this sequence all in the snow.' It was marvelous! Because it had a silence about it, a kind of majesty it wouldn't have had if it had been done on a sunny day or any other kind of day.""

The old-school acting can inspire eye-rolling at times, but Sir Alec Guinness, James Mason, and Christopher Plummer keep things lively with well-calibrated performances, and John Ireland, Mel Ferrer, and Anthony Quayle contribute as supporting players. Anthony Mann ably choreographs the action sequences, including an impressive chariot race sequence and battles between the Romans and the raven-maned Germanic ""barbarians"" at the gates. This long film's centrepiece scene is Commodus' quite remarkable procession into what may be the largest film set ever built and the Roman Forum recreation and culminating in the warning ""Remember: thou art mortal."" Tell that to producer Samuel Bronston, who bankrupted his production company with this entertaining epic.

When THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE finally opened in its theatrical run, the critics were sharply divided over it. The film was made toward the end of the epic film cycle in the early sixties and many moviegoers had become bored with the genre. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, ""So massive and incoherent is it, so loaded with Technicolor spectacles, tableaus and military melees that have no real meaning or emotional pull, that you're likely to have the feeling after sitting through its more than three hours...that the Roman Empire has fallen on you."" Numerous reviewers pointed out that Anthony Mann's film was a distortion of Edward Gibbon's work, an accusation that prompted the director to remark, ""Now I guarantee you there is not one person that had read Edward Gibbon...From Bosley Crowther on down or up. And for them to start to say: 'This isn't Gibbon' well, this is a load of crap! Because all we were trying to do was dramatized how the Roman Empire fell. Incest, buying an army, destroying the will of the people to speak through the Senate, all these things...were in the film."" Nevertheless, The Fall of the Roman Empire was generally overlooked during Oscar time though it did receive a sole nomination for Best Score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Yet the film certainly had its defenders, particularly in England where the Daily Express called it ""an epic to make one cheer rather than cringe"" and the critic for the Evening Standard ""proclaimed it one of the best all-round epics I have ever seen."" And in recent years, the film's reputation continues to grow with director Martin Scorsese among its more famous admirers.

Blu-ray Video Quality  THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE storms onto the Blu-ray format courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment with an awesome impressive 1080p [Technicolor] encoded image, and also with an equally impressive 2.35:1 [Panavision] aspect ratio. The 1080p image is remarkably sharp with excellent detail on this Region B/2 Blu-ray disc, and there is still a lot of excellent separation of shades, and black levels are strikingly solid, the effect is breath-taking. There is also some wonderful cinematography in this film; especially with a long, continuous and panning shots of all the running battle scenes is totally mesmerising and the clarity even benefits the action scenes. All in all the presentation is totally fantastic. This is a superb effort from Anchor Bay Entertainment that once again proves how fabulous classic films can look in 1080p. Like the best video experiences, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE really transports you to another time; to ancient Rome, to vintage Hollywood. And it makes us appreciate this glorious Blu-ray technology not only for what it can do for the present and future, but also for the past. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Anchor Bay Entertainment 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound presentation on this Blu-ray disc, is a totally awesome solid one. Surround sounds manage to be in good use a good bit of the time, delivering both ambiance and action. Sometimes they aren't always active, especially in a few spots where we would expect them to be in some scenes. The militaristic, percussion-heavy music of composer Dimitri Tiomkin sounds wonderfully powerful and engaging, and especially with the opening credits. The battle scene sequences, you really feel the impact of the all the fighting that goes on in those scenes and you get some nice effects, as well as chilling ones. This soundtrack is the best I've ever heard with this film, and easily surpasses the totally inferior DVD disc I owned for some time.

DVD Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Rise and Fall of an Epic Production [2008] [480i] [1.78:1] [29:12] Here we are presented with a great new documentary on the making of the film The Fall Of The Roman Empire, and we have contributions from Mel Martin [Author]; Paul G. Nagle [Biographer of Samuel Bronston]; Norma Barzman [Wife of Ben Barzman]; Neal M. Rosendorf, Ph. D. [Historian and Biographer]; Anna Mann [Wife of Anthony Mann]; Nina Mann [Daughter of Anthony Mann]; C.O. ""Doc"" Erickson [Production Manager] and William Bronston, M.D. [Son of Samuel Bronston]. As we get into this special feature, we get to hear how Anthony Mann was in London and came across a book shop that had the abridged novel of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and Anthony Mann immediately contacted Samuel Bronston to inform him that this should be their next project, because the book would inspire to make a fantastic film on the Roman Empire and with the help of famous British thespian actors, it would give an international appeal to the paying public. After they had finished the film EL CID, which starred Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren and felt they would be ideal for this Roman epic film, but unfortunately Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren hated and detested the sight of each other, so Charlton Heston turned the part down, but Sophia Loren was totally enthusiastic to sign up for the part in the film. One thing we are told is that Sophia Loren got on so well with Anthony Mann and also loved all the English actors accents and especially Sir Alec Guinness. We get to hear some fascinating facts about this Roman epic film, because there were 60,000 extras employed for the film, they employed 350 construction workers, there was 170,000 concrete blocks cast, which resulted in 27 three dimensional structures, 1.6 million feet of tubing was used, which would of measured 320 miles laid end to end, there was also 33,000 gallons of paint used, there was over 350 free standing statues of varies sizes. The tallest structure was the Temple of Jupiter which rose to 650 feet, that sat on a man-made hill, which rose almost a 100 feet in the air and so all in all they built was historical accurate. Although EL CID was a box office hit, sadly The Fall Of The Roman Empire was a financial headache and cost over $28 million to make and at the time of its release was not a box office hit, but today it has now become a cult classic hit, where everyone appreciates the films artistic merit.

Special Feature: Dimitri Tiomkin: Scoring The Roman Empire [2008] [480i] [1.78:1] [20:03] This special feature goes into magnificent depth on the subtleties of Dimitri Tiomkin composer's work on the Roman epic film, and here we have contributions from John Burlingame [Film Music Historian]; Olivia Tiomkin-Douglas [Widow of Dimitri Tiomkin]; Mel Martin [Author] and John Mauceri [Conductor]. We get to hear that Dimitri Tiomkin was not happy with his work on EL CID as he felt the sound effects drowned out his music score, so with the collaboration with Samuel Bronston, he wanted Dimitri Tiomkin film score to be heard and was given total freedom. Most of the recordings were done in London and Samuel Bronston spent a lot of money on the film score, which in turn brought out the best in Dimitri Tiomkin music score for this Roman epic film. At the start of the film you get the dramatic organ music and also at the end of the film, well it was done by the organ in Westminster Hall in London. But of course with this special feature on Dimitri Tiomkin, everyone praises this brilliant film composer, because with all the films he has composed for, he always brings out the best with every film in such a dramatic way.

Special Feature: Julius Caesar: The Rise of the Roman Empire [1964] [480i] [1.33:1] [21:38] On the 15th March, 44 B.C., a man was murdered on the floor of the Roman Senate and among the assassins, could be counted more friends than his enemies, but most of all he was loved, he was hated, but most of all he was feared. Here we have a dramatized story of Julius Caesar's rise to power, explaining the factors that enabled him to transform a city-republic into a world empire. Discusses the personal qualities of Julius Caesar in relation to the political, economic, and social conditions that existed in Rome in the last century before the birth of Christ. The film was produced by Encyclopaedia Britannica Films Inc. It was in collaboration with John W. Eadie, Ph. D. [University of Michigan]. But most importantly it was produced in cooperation with The Samuel Bronston Production in relation with the film THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Directed and Produced by William Deneen. Music was composed by Fred Jocobs.

Special Feature: Rome in Madrid [1964] [480i] [1.37:1] [22:14] With this full-colour 1964 promotional film, that is narrated by James Mason. A cut above the usual style of documentary and the film gives us glimpses of the massive sets being built, as well as the production's stables and arsenal. We see the arrival of Sophie Loren in Madrid. You see costume and makeup screen tests for Sir Alec Guinness, Christopher Plummer, Stephen Boyd, James Mason, and Omar Sharif. Sir Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer are viewed in a staged chess match; and we get a comparison of the standing Roman ruins, artist's rendering of the buildings, and the finished set. This was a Globe Video Film Production.

Special Feature: Hollywood vs. History [2008] [480i] [1.78:1] [9:45] Here we get contributions from the experts Dr. Neal M. Rosendorf, Ph. D. [Historian and Biographer]; Dr. Peter Heather [King's College London]; Dr. Ronald Mellor [Professor of Roman History at the UCLA]; Norma Barzman [Wife of Ben Barzman] and Mel Martin [Author]. They all look at the parts of the Roman Epic film that accurately represent the reality of the situations and characters as well as which elements take liberties. We get to find out about the real facts versus fiction aspect of Hollywoods impression of the Roman Empire in this special feature. The all say they were very impressed with the film set in Madrid, and also comparing the film's script to what's historically known. But one passing thought from Mel Martin, is that the film is not 100% accurate, but the film has to look much more spectacular, otherwise it would be totally boring for the general paying public.

Special Feature: Claudius: Boy Of Ancient Rome [1964] [480i] [1.37:1] [16:08] Once again we have another presentation film from the people at Encyclopaedia Britannica Films Inc. A dramatisation of a Roman boy's friendship with a slave in his father's household. It depicts, through the young boys' experiences and activities, the way of life and customs of ancient Rome. Once again William Deneen utilises the sets from Samuel Bronston's epic 'The Fall of the Roman Empire.' This 'Claudius' was actually one of two released concurrently by the Encyclopaedia Britannica Films Inc. It was in collaboration with John W. Eadie, Ph. D. [University of Michigan]. But most importantly it was produced in cooperation with The Samuel Bronston Production in relation with the film THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Directed and Produced by William Deneen. Music was composed by Fred Jocobs.

Special Feature: Life in Ancient Rome [1964] [480i] [1.33:1] [15:32] Here we have commentator William Deneen gives us a running commentary, especially describing that in the year 106 A.D. during the reign of the Emperor Trajan, the power of Rome extended throughout most of the known world. The new government was strong enough to maintain world peace for more than two centuries. This film describes the life in Rome during this time. We also get to see the sight in Madrid informing us about the different structure designs of the building. The film was produced by Encyclopaedia Britannica Films Inc. It was in collaboration with John W. Eadie, Ph. D. [University of Michigan]. But most importantly it was produced in cooperation with The Samuel Bronston Production in relation with the film THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Directed and Produced by William Deneen. Music was composed by Fred Jocobs.

Special Feature: The Rise and Fall of an Empire [2008] [480i] [1.78:1] [10:58] At the start of this documentary, we get a sign saying, Henry David Thoreau says, Rome imposes her story still upon this late generation. Once again we get contributions from Dr. Peter Heather [Professor of Medieval History] and Dr. Ronald Mellor [Professor of Roman History at the UCLA]. Here we get informed more known facts about Rome, and also the unencumbered aspect view in Hollywood. We also hear about the historic structure of the Roman Empire, from its great heights of being a super power, but we also hear the reason for the collapse of the Roman Empire, but most of all many scholars have theorised the collapse of the Roman Empire, but they cannot give a direct precise answer why the collapse of the Roman Empire happened.

Special Feature: Bill Deneen New Intro [1964] [480i] [1.78:1] [3:28] Here we get to see a much older Bill Deneen [Director and Producer] who was the head of the Encyclopaedia Britannica Films Inc. Bill Deneen talks about how he was able to make his Encyclopaedia Britannic Films about the Roman Empire in conjunction with the film The Fall Of The Roman Empire, especially being able to use the Madrid film set after the film was finished. The situation arose when Bill Deneen contacted Samuel Bronson and asked if could use the film set and without any hesitation Samuel Bronson gave Bill Deneen the green light and was very honoured that someone wanted to use the film set in Madrid. When Bill Deneen finally visited the Roman film set, he was totally overwhelmed by what he encountered when he finally walked onto the film set.

Theatrical Trailer [1964] [480i [1.37:1] [4:02] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film The Fall Of The Roman Empire. But for some unknown reason it is being brought to you by The Rank Organisation and being presented on the DVD disc, the quality is totally atrocious.

Finally, on the purely image level, there are some impressive scenes, such as one of a parade of chariots arriving at a northern fortress in the snow, and another of the funeral of Marcus Aurelius. This has the grandeur of ancient ritual, with the bier of the dead emperor carried in a torchlight procession through the swirling snow. There is also something very commanding about Dmitri Tiomkin's musical score. Largely accurate in historical terms, thanks to a wordy but intelligent script by Philip Yordan who was a master of the epic style, it is surprisingly restrained, both in terms of action and acting. But the atmosphere is consistently convincing: darkness holds sway on the fringes of the Empire, where the armies are struggling to repel the invading hordes, while Rome is presented as a magnificent but decadent monument to the unimaginative pragmatism of the Roman mind. But overall it has fantastic awesome terrific sets, and again a stirring music score by Dimitri Tiomkin and the overall quality of the production values manage to counteract the film's length. All in all THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is a really wonderful old-fashioned, widescreen, 172 minutes epic, shot in glorious Technicolor and Anthony Manns film is a feast for the eyes and they certainly do not make films like this classic look at the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. Highly Recommended!

How this film destroyed a film maker is a good story, but lets stick to it.  This storyline
was mediorce at best.  I did like the first 1 hour of the movie as it reminded me of ""Gladiator"" with Russell Crowe,
and there was excellent acting on all sides.  Frankly the end of the movie is awful and I can
see why its not a favorite on TCM.  I didn't like 55 days at Peking either though.  Overally
great scenery and some good acting.  But this was never an El Cid and could never be that.  That glorious
film called ""El Cid"" is a wonderful film and in many ways much better than Ben Hur.  Though I love them both.  I won't get rid of this boxed set, but its not worth more than 15 bucks.",1412985600,,797,4.012738853503185

1197667,2,B000009O12,"This was obviously an expensive film to produce, acres of sets, hundreds of extras, top stars in the cast, but surprisingly tedious and boring to watch. To begin with, Alec Guinness was underutilized as an actor; his performance as the elder Caesar was muted and low-key, with zero passion. Christopher Plummer, himself a great actor, played the entirely predictable evil psychotic son of Caesar, who, of course, inherited the throne.

1197691,4,B000009O12,"There's several possible reasons why Samuel Bronston's three hour swords & sandals epic THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE was a box office failure in 1964. Chief among them was the studio's deletion of about 35 minutes of story. According to Bronston's son, these eliminations were all of ""adult scenes,"" that is, dialog-laden sequences that often expressed philosophy or set up what was about to occur. PARAMOUNT was apparently more interested in action than pith.

Similarly, marketing was all wrong. emphasizing scenes that were of minor importance to the whole (like a chariot race).

It's also possible that timing of the film's debut was unfortunate. When ""Fall"" reached theaters, we were already&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CLEOPATRA/dp/B000059HAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CLEOPATRA</a>'ed out, weary of Ancient Roman spectacles, but more important, the country was turned off by ""dark"" stories and we sought escapism after JFK's brutal murder a few months earlier. Thus 1964 was the year of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MARY-POPPINS/dp/B00E9ZATKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MARY POPPINS</a>, surf music and Beatlemania.

Kirk Douglas and Charlton Heston both turned down the lead in ""Fall."" Douglas thought the script weak while Heston didn't want to get typecast in movies set thousands of years ago. The choice of Stephen Boyd (as fictional Livius) wasn't a strong one. He was good as Heston's chariot race foe in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BEN-HUR/dp/B0009UZG1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BEN HUR</a>&nbsp;(1959), but didn't have the acting chops to carry such a large picture. Sophia Loren-- attractive but also not the most talented of actresses, didn't help either.

Everything else was first rate: incredible sets, lavishly appointed to the smallest detail, beautiful costumes of the actual materials worn in the Empire: carved leather, metals, sheerest silks etc., a gorgeous Dimitri Tiomkin score and a superior director (Anthony Mann) and supporting cast that included: Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, Anthony Quayle, John Ireland, Omar Sharif, Mel Ferrer and Finlay Currie.",1388620800,,2247,6.430463576158941

1197698,3,B000009O12,"It is beyond my imagination that ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" gets a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, when the popular score is a much more realistic 64%, which is where I put the movie. I recall seeing it back in the good old days of three broadcast channels, and movies run every night on one or two of those channels. At the time, I thought it was just a bit cheesy and sentimental, especially with James Mason's role, which should probably have been played by a character actor who better fit the part.

As I watch it now, we have the advantage of comparing it to the Academy award winning film, ""Gladiator"", and see exactly where the older movie fails. The two main differences are with the two male leads. Russell Crowe is a better actor than Stephen Boyd every day of the week, and twice on Sundays.  Joaquin Phoenix is far better than Christopher Plummer, at least in this role. In the role of Marcus Aurelius, Richard Harris and Alec Guinness come out a tie, with Harris just a pinch better as the world weary emperor. I have to confess that Sophia Lauren does a better, or at least a more camera captivating performance than relative unknown, Connie Nielson.

The scores are about even. the Dimitri Tiomkin is majestic, and long. But the Hans Zimmer score for Gladiator is more delicate and evocative in many scenes.

Neither film follows history quite as well as it could have, and I suspect ""Gladiator"" strays more that ""Fall..."" but I think ""Gladiator"" is a better story. Even the spectacular scenes in ""Gladiator"", driven by CGI, are better than the huge live scenes of ""Fall..."" The opening 15 minutes of ""Gladiator"" alone outshines all the action scenes of ""Fall...""

In a nutshell, ""Gladiator"" has higher highs and lower lows, such as the moment when Maximus returns to his farm to find his murdered wife and son. Russell Crowe ""owns"" Gladiator. He and Ridley Scott seem to be a perfect match of actor and director. I also have to put in a good word for one of my favorite actors, Oliver Reed, who does a marvelous role, even if some was done with CGI, after Reed died before shooting was over.

""The Fall..."" does use a famous historical assessment of the empire, from Gibbon's famous ""The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire"", which marked Commodious' time as emperor as the beginning of the end of the empire. But this film takes too much out of the Hollywood epic play book and does not spend enough time on really dwelling on the characters.",1379808000,,2464,4.5633484162895925

1197715,5,B000009O12,"The Fall of the Roman Empire is a 1964 historical epic set in Ancient Rome directed by Anthony Mann, produced by Samuel Bronston and starring Stephen Boyd, Sophia Loren and Christopher Plummer in the leads. (I had a hard time getting lines like ""The race goes on."" and ""Didn't I beg you?"" out of my mind everytime I saw Boyd.) No one needs to tell me this movie is probably only 40% historically accurate. I don't care. I still enjoyed it.
 The plot involves Gaius Livius, a good-hearted centurion and his experiences under two emporers: Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. Unlike most roman legionaries, Livius does not revel in justice. He hates to see hostages mistreated. He is disgusted when Commodus gives him a slave girl and takes his upstairs. When he gains a massive victory over the Parthians, Emporer Commodus is so impressed he sends a petition to Livius to become joint rulers with him over the entire empire on the condition that he round up 5,000 men, women and children and burn them alive to teach them a lesson about rebelling against Rome. Livius tears the petition up, binds the men who delivered it, puts them in cages and sends them back as an answer to his emporer.
 Stephen Boyd was a fine actor and gives a good solid performance as the dependable, tough, good guy, Livius. Sophia Loren is beautiful and delivers a very great acting piece as Lucilla, Livius' love interest. Her finest scenes are when she is reclining on a couch in Commodus' palace in the pink dress and her monologue when she runs through the dancing crowd to the pyre in the second half of the film.  But this film most unquestionably belongs to Christopher Plummer as the evil emporer Commodus. He is wonderfully handsome and cavorts around with energy and flair in whatever scene he is in. His character is a decadent playboy who would rather be in the gynasium than running the country. When he runs the country, disaster is not far off. Alec Guinness, James Mason, Omar Shariff, etc.) all deliver good strong performances that keep the standard of the film high.
 The pacing is occasionally a little sluggish (paticulary at Marcus Aurelius' funeral and Commodus' triumphal entry into Rome) but the quick, sharp and intelligent dialogue make up for it. It's better to have more dialogue to flesh out the motives of the characters than to have one action-packed scene after the other while the audience is scratching their heads wondering why these people did what they did. Robert Krasker's cienematography contains rich, dark colors like an oil painting and his snow scenes in the first half are a magnificent highlight. The sets are real three-dimensional, marble buildings Hollywood wouldn't dream of making now in our present-day CGI era. Dmitri Tiomkin's music is rich with schmaltzy, Straussian melodies and garnered an oscar nomination.
 All in all, The Fall of the Roman Empire is one of the finest of the old style epics, featuring exquiste performances, great sets and an engaging plot.

This film makes the deeply inaccurate portrayal that Alec Guinness' character, Emperor Marcus Aurelius, originated, late in the history of ancient Rome, the idea of friendly integration of conquered peoples into the Roman body politic (granting of citizenship, and other privileges); moreover that his design was frustrated by his untimely death and the wickedness of his son (played by Christopher Plummer). Not so - ancient Rome was distinct almost from it's inception, hundreds of years earlier, for policies of integrating conquered peoples rather than extinguishing them. This novel approach to Empire is a key to understanding the rise of Rome; the fantasy that this approach was fashioned by one man, and the failure to implement was the cause of Rome's fall is pure nonsense.",1355529600,,965,5.1075949367088604

1197719,5,B000009O12,"FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of the most underrated film epics of all time. It has a very intelligent script, witty dialogue and an insightful sense of humor (the intellectually amusing banter between Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius and James Mason as Timonides is far above that found in biblical type epics). The cast is impressive including Sophia Loren, Anthony Quail, John Ireland, Omar Sharif and Mel Ferrer (probably his best screen performance as the blind and deceitful Cleander). James Mason gives a lesson in histrionics giving yet another brilliant performance unlike anything he had done previously.

Robert Krasker's cinematography especially filmed on the frozen frontier with the ominous forest in the background and snowflakes blustering across the screen are astonishingly atmospheric combined with one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most impressionistic, elegiac and enigmatic scores. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is lush and beautifully haunting throughout. The action sequences are impressively staged. The chariot chase on the frontier road and downhill through the pines between the stoic Stephen Boyd (Livius) and a very flamboyantly psychotic Christopher Plumber (Commodus) is a highlight. Most impressive are the outstanding and unbelievable sets by production designers Veniero Colasanti and John Moore.

Director Anthony Mann has a great ability to use outdoor landscapes to full advantage enhancing the drama. He contrasts the beauty of nature with unscrupulous men's desires to control their environment through manipulation and deceit against other men of greater moral fortitude.

1197722,2,B000009O12,"I am collecting the hollywood epics, which I so enjoyed as a boy when they came out.  Sometimes they are wonderful surprises, with depth, intelligence, and subtlety that offer an entirely new viewing experience to the adult.  Alas, this one was just the opposite:  though lavish and glitzy, it so completely fails as a drama that I was shocked at how bad it was.  Just as I could not believe how bad the story of Waterworld was even though it was the most expensive film ever made at the time, I feel the same for this.  How, with such a gigantic production, could it turn out to be such a stinking dud?

The narrative occurs within the same frame as Gladiator:  the great Marcus Aurelias is assassinated, his crazy son takes over, then is killed in the arena by the good and faithful general.  Leaving aside that this ignores history (Commodus was strangled in his bed, his sister having long before been executed), the story simply doesn't work.  First, the good guys are complete bores.  Stephen Boyd, whom I truly admired as a charismatic actor, is so poorly directed in this that he comes off as a stick figure out of a kid's history book, complete with bland obeissance to the state that turns to disgusted rage.  Aurelias is almost as bad.  The barbarians are reliably noble, etc.  The only interesting character is the insane Commodus - Plummer delivers a wonderful performance.  Second, the romance between Boyd and Loren not only utterly lacks chemistry, but it looks like a formula straight out of a 2nd rate soap opera.  It is just thrown in as the obligatory melodrama.  Third, there is a lack of spirit to just about every single scene:  I just couldn't quite believe any of it, from the huge war scenes to the chariot race that so pathetically mimicked the one from Ben Hur.  Fourth, the way that belief in the Roman state breaks down so easily doesn't ring true, as the scene where the soldiers scramble for the gold that Commodus' patsies fling around - this after the campaign in Persia, when they were blood brothers with the leaders and would follow them to the death.  I simply didn't feel it was portraying the historical forces it claimed it would.

Other aspects of the production also fall flat.  The music is somehow off and detracts from the feeling of the film.  It is a constant irritant.  The sets, while unprecedented in ambition and size, feel somehow static rather than teeming with life from a different time.  All in all, it doesn't surprise me that this is known as the ""last grand epic"" of that period, the 50-60s.  It failed at the box office for a reason.  The extras with the bluray do not add much.  You have the usual papp of promotional video - ""it was so wonderful"" - and some dated Encl Britannica documentaries thrown in that were filmed on the set.  Indeed, some of the people interviewed advance some pretty lame arguments, like an historian, who says it's OK for hollywood to ignore historical accuracy for the sake of a story.  (A supportable position, to be sure, but they could still do much better, if you ask me.)

1197725,5,B000009O12,"Hi,

  I just have a few questions about the current blu ray release of ""Fall of the Roman Empire""...

Is this an IMPORT or a domestic release ?  (I've heard speculation it might be Canadian ?)

Will it play on U.S. blu ray players ?

If an import, is this the reason for the rather high blu ray price ?

Do any domestic copanies have plans to release Fall of the Roman empire in the United States ?

Thanks,

1197728,4,B000009O12,"I am 64 and have seen so many epics from bygone days, that I feel I could write my own history book based on Hollywood's attempts at
ancient authenticity!

However....I always had a soft spot in my heart for epics, great and (admittedly hard for me to admit) not so great!  Yes, what you see nowadays is mostly action and barebones suspense, special effects
and computer-generated baloney.  Not for me!

The Fall of The Roman Empire was one of the epic Epics!  Great star power (excluding Boyd, who I could only stomach as Messala in Ben Hur), great sets, and - yes - THAT EVER-NECESSARY ""CAST OF THOUSANDS""!!! Hail to the glory of those old days...they only occassionally pop up in great works such as the FIRST (AND ONLY THE FIRST!) STAR WARS TRILOGY!

Yes the scale is of grand proportions and the story is taken (admittedly, again, a dust-off of the real story that took place from
200BC to circa 450 AD, when the real ""FALL"" actually DID take place!  AND WHAT A FALL IT WAS!).

As for the comparison of The Fall and GLADIATOR, I must start by admitting (feel like I'm in court!) that I'm an absolutely sold
Ridley Scott fan!  Gladiator, to me, (apparently not to many other reviewers, but that's ok) WAS a great epic, but with a crucial difference - as with all of Scott's movies, no matter the plot or the actors, the underside/dark side of much of what passes for epic and drama, is out there front and center!  Scott has no equal in
showing us the personal and painful side of things that usually
get swallowed up when viewed on an ""epic"" scale...Russel Crowe's Gladiator was a monumentally EPIC  non-epic, from the personal side,
and - though it, like so many other ""epics"" purporting to show us
the great events of history (see THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AND THE OTHER
DEMILLE COLOR PACKAGES) was made with only a nod or two to actual
ancient events...but, you learned and cried and felt taken in on
a grandly beautiful and tragic scale by Scott's treatment of a one great man's struggle to be human in an inhumanely Roman Empiric
scam job that was the falling ""Empire"".

SPARTACUS is another one of these nonepic Epics!  Same idea - Spartacus was a slave, destined to be ignored by a reader of Roman history...as was Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator.
All the great star power in the world (and Kirk Douglas and Russel Crowe certainly fill that bil!) can't make a great epic, UNLESS
a director like Scott or Kubrick is running things!

You want excitement?  Real excitement?  And, a little education along the way, without the made-up ""special effects"" that so often
put the real history into the background (Spartacus was, by the way,
real, although I believe Maximus was a fiction, but not the incredibly brutal treatment of all things living, Roman or otherwise,
by Commodus, played admirably by Joaquin Phoenix, and - I have to admit (hah!), Christopher Plummer in The Fall...

GO OUT TO BARNES AND NOBLE AND BUY THE BOOK!  FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE!  It has its faults and misrepresentations based on the author's ""historic"" perspecive, but it GRABS you by the throat and won't let go; and it EDUCATES!

Yes, I still love a good epic and still crave more of the Stars Wars (Trilogy One), Close Encounters, Spartacus, and Gladiator.  Ben Hur is passable, but my childhood (who knew?) favorite, Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments was so out of kilter with real history
(see, for example, the REAL reason those great pyramids got built
and who built them!) that incredible star power and special effects were just not enough to give us at least a partial taste of the sweep of history in ancient Egypt and ""Palestine"".

Yes, I give The Fall of The Roman Empire  a ""thumbs up"", but
I raise both arms in salute to the Spartacuses, Gladiators, Black Rains, and Michael Crichton thrillers!  And let's jump for joy
for Star Wars One thru Three (THE FIRST TRILOGY ONLY!).

The 1st half is filled w/ good scenes: an unnecessary but still thrilling BEN-HUR-ish chariot race/fight, this time through a forest, a battle w/ Vandals, and a funeral for the murdered emperor during a snow storm. After all this on the German frontier, we go back to Rome and the absolutely astounding Roman Forum, still the largest set ever built. Unfortunately the 2nd half is bogged down w/ a murky plot that tries to cover too much ground. Even at 3 hours, the film feels choppy and heavily edited. Christopher Plummer, in his 1st big screen role, is a wonderfully fruity Commodus, but Stephen Boyd is a dispiriting lump as the hero.

1197738,2,B000009O12,"Director Anthony Mann evidently likes horses.
For nearly 45 minutes, the viewer is supposed to be spellbound by scene after scene after boring scene of men on horses as they parade past Roman leaders and later in more scenes after boring scenes when the officials enter a battlefield.  Long, drawn out scenes of talking heads doesn't help much although some of the cast members suggest impatience in trying to escape to more exciting climes.
Mann also seems in awe of femme star, Sophia Loren, as we see her in an abundance of lovely close-ups that might appear in a movie magazine of the fifties. However, Loren is as animated as a robot. She glides through her scenes and enunciates verrrrry carefulllly with an occsional tear trickling from her right eye to show deep emotion. Mann was obviously thrilled with Loren's robot-like performance that replicats her robot-like personae from Mann's previous turkey, ""El Cid.""
In no sense is the viewer made aware that there really IS a Roman empire hiding out of sight.

1197740,5,B000009O12,"""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) suffers from the absence of Charlton Heston, who turned down the lead role of Livius. Producer Samuel Bronston next turned to Kirk Douglas, who seems to later regret also refusing that role in his autobiography ""The Ragman's Son"". Without either of epic cinema's two central heroic actors, ""The Fall"" was crippled from the start. Although Irish actor Stephen Boyd fills the role of Livius with the requisite authority and discipline, he lacks expressive passion and the vivid gap between himself and heroine Sophia Loren as tortured lovers is the major disconnect in the entire film. However, what remains is surely one of the most stupendous epic films ever created. Last in the tetralogy started in 1959 with ""John  Paul Jones"" from Samuel Bronston (Trotsky's nephew), ""The Fall"" was directed by Anthony Mann and beautifully filmed by Robert Krasker - the duo also responsible for Bronston's greatest achievement ""El Cid"". With masterful performances by Alec Guinness as Emperor Marcus Aurelius and James Mason as his Greek advisor, the acting standard is led by Canadian Christopher Plummer as the megalomaniac Emperor Commodus. Colasanti and Moore, one-time designers at Milan's la Scala, deliver collosal sets reproducing Rome's frontier fortresses, her imperial palaces, temples and metropolitan Forum. To the background of magnificently lush music supplied by Dimitri Tiomkin, the largest sets in the world bring an audacious liveliness and credibility to the project. Mann shows what he may have done with ""Spartacus"" had he been kept on that earlier project by delivering a dark film-noir first half dominated by imperial family intrigue, snowy shadows and menacing forests. An obvious influence on ""Star Wars"" as well as the clear model for ""Gladiator"", ""The Fall"" was lauded by Martin Scorcese as having the beauty of a lost art. The funeral pyre of Aurelius, shot outdoors in real snowfall, is a peak in epic filmmaking, as the eerie keen of massed legionnaires fills the screen. With an ill-advised marketing campaign, financial strain after the enormous investment as well as bad timing after the Kennedy assassination and the relative failure of ""Cleopatra"" at the box office, ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was Bronston's last major effort. In just five short years, he had progressed the epic tradition of Griffith and DeMille and delivered lasting historical visions of epic grandeur. None more grand than ""The Fall of The Roman Empire"". Had Heston or Douglas filled the role of Livius with human depth and passion, that tradition might have reached even higher things. As it stands, ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" is a magnificent ruin, as worthy of constant revisiting as the physical archaeology it so brilliantly rebirths. Short of perfect in acting and story development, it is without question superb in directing, photography, sets and design, music and cinematic maturity. After ""The Fall"", cinema itself declined for many years. This was the last of old Hollywood, ironically created by Samuel Bronston away from Hollywood in Franco's Spain. With twenty lost minutes to be added at some point hopefully in the future, these remastered discs are the best of what English-speaking epic cinema has now to offer.",1277510400,,3273,5.222433460076045

First, it did badly in the theaters, was about three hours long, and while it was full of stars I pictured it being something like an ancient Playboy Estate, with lots of feasts and orgies and bloody games.  Yet, many modern reviews and essays on the film suggested some real meaning within the scenes.  So I finally decided to watch it.
It was wonderful.  Dialogue about power, duty, freedom.  Battle scenes, yes, but also wonderful, beautiful landscapes, snow swept forests, and Rome.  Not a computer generated Rome, but a Rome built in Spain with marble, and gold, and filled with hundreds of extras - many of them tourists.
This is one of the last big toga epics, yes, but not because it was a bad film - it was just before its time.  Nobody wanted to hear the messages, the warnings it was trying to deliver.  Real life, with the Vietnam Conflict and the death of JFK was depressing enough without having to see it played out AGAIN on the big screen.
But the messages are still there and just as important to us in 2010 as they were in 1964.  Maybe even more so.

I had the privilege of seeing this movie in the Producer's Viewing Room at the Chamartin Studios in Madrid before it was edited for exibition and was astounded at its elegance and adult line.  When it was commercially released I was outraged that the most artistically original and psychological mature pieces had been removed never to be found since.  Yet, sitting and watching this massive project on screen one cannot help but be haunted by the prescience of its politics and serendipity with our Bush era experience.  We are watching a metaphor of our America with all its growing inhumanity and relentless investment in wars at the edge of its empire at the expense of its epicenter - our social fabric and cultural civility.  The other triangulating amazement is to see and know that every detail of this epic was created in tangible reality, every weapon, horse, costume, set decoration, edifice, individual was real...moved on verbal cue...with no special effects, no computer generated imagery, no visual trickery. If you are going to reconstruct the Roman Forum in all its actual splendor, why chisel anywhere else. Then the presence of Anthony Mann's signature ""fire"" in every important scene, the exquisite geometric design of every frame, like classic tableaus with unerring discipline and artistry that go by in a seamless continuum that every viewer soon takes for granted and hypnotically grows to ignore in the flow of the movie.  The achievement of this film, now nearly 50 years old, is all so boggling to me in juxtaposition to where James Cameron takes us visually with ""Avatar""in all its electronically created beauty.  What dramatically comparable poles of this daunting movie making social art!  Critically watching the powerfully remastered Weinstein Collectors DVD set for ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" and the panoply of special features, stories within stories, that comprises this emperor's journey, sweeps one into visual tides that lift, propel and overwhelm in sheer scope and complexity. It takes great acuity, focus and attention to register the myriad details of production here which are immensely rewarding.  Then, add the sound design which couches the whole in an audio vehicle just as complex, in parallel, to the visual miracle.  I think that one must decide to watch this 'monster' at the right time when there are no distractions and you are ready to feel and examine its monumental substance.

1197747,4,B000009O12,"Before Gladiator, there was The Fall of the Roman Empire.  Both films covered the same time period of 180-192 AD.  Most of the characters are the same.  The protagonist in both films is fictional.

The 1964 film is stunning in its Spanish cinematography.  The massive sets are impressive.  The script is well written with dialogue that would stimulate the thinker.  Dimitri Tiomkin would win the Golden Globe for the musical score, but not the Oscar. Anthony Mann's direction is superb for the most part.

Alex Guinness, later of Star Wars fame, brilliantly portrays Marcus Aurelius.  His one desire is for ""golden centuries of peace"" and ""a family of equal nations"".

Sophia Loren plays the daughter, Lucilla.  Her love for her father and Livius are the two opposite sides of reality which brings her internal conflict.

James Mason is outstanding as Timonides, a Greek Christian and friend to both Marcus and Livius.  His best scene is between him and Ballomar, the leader of the northern barbarians.  It is a true test of his faith.

Commodus is given vibrant life by Christopher Plummer.  Unlike the Gladiator character, this Commodus is not only reckless but thrives on combat.  He is no coward, but he is a bit mad.

Much criticism has been heaped on Stephen Boyd's Gaius Metellus Livius.  He had a difficult task.  Both Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas had turned down the role. Unfortunately, he does come across lifeless.  There is no chemistry between Livius and Lucilla.  He is just too restrained in his acting which has to be partly attributed to Mann's direction.

Unfortunately, the film was a financial failure at a cost of over 18 million.  The only Oscar nomination was for the musical score.

When this film premi&egrave;red in March 1964, the nation was still suffering the loss of John Kennedy.  The top films of 1964 included Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Pink Panther, Goldfinger, Father Goose, etc.  Definitely, musicals and comedies were the fare that people wanted.  Something as serious as the Fall of the Roman Empire was perhaps too realistic of current events in the real world.

To a number of people, the title was misleading.  However, in its defense, it is true that after the death of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Empire began a steep decline.  Will Durant of THE STORY OF CIVILIZATION series was the historical consultant.

1197750,2,B000009O12,"I tried hard to like this flick, but eventually concluded that Rome was depicted best as either a stupendous Cecil B. DeMille extravaganza, or a savvy drawing-room drama on the order of ""I, Claudius."" There's a strange unpleasant tension and imbalance throughout: a script that doesn't quite flow, actors that seem not fully engaged (even Mason and Guinness merely appear professional rather than riveting, and the leads are second-rate and two-dimensional), scenic designers who are striving for visual bling and never quite getting there, and so on. Even the gratuitous chariot action sequence, touted as the equal of Ben Hur's, feels more like something from a Romanized ""Dukes of Hazard"" or ""Streets of San Francisco.""

The first half of the film takes place place at a Roman fort at the northern frontier. We see a lot of this fort in long shot, way too much of it in fact, and from the same angles, as if the producer had spent a good hunk of change on this one location and wanted to make the most of it, but the property owners would only give them a few square yards to set up cameras. The effect is theatrical and subsequently claustrophobic--Rome seems twenty miles away (or just behind the curtain), and when the Legion boldly marches out from the fort to battle with the Germanic tribes, the enemy appears to be encamped about 50 yards into the forest. Later in the film, twenty miles down the road, back in Rome, we have another set consisting of a tight grouping of about five grand Roman edifices, again seen from the same recurrent angles. Overall, there is no sense whatsoever that Rome (or this movie) extends anywhere beyond five blocks, or that the Empire was any bigger than Rhode Island.

This is just bad, or at minimum, uninspired, directing and it's what keeps this film (along with the director's equally clumsy ""El Cid"") forever at the periphery of epic blockbusters. It's an 'A' movie with 'B' movie chops, except a good 'B' director knows how to get the maximum from minimal materials and this director manages to make even Imperial Rome seem lifeless, the story of its fall uneventful, and a great-to-fair cast bland.

It would make a good double feature paired with Richard Burton's stunningly uninteresting ""Alexander the Great.""",1234915200,,2262,4.839793281653747

Now he invited every governor, every consul and every prince in the whole empire for one particular purpose... All responded to his call coming from the deserts of Egypt, from the mountains of Armenia, from the forest of Gaul and the prairies of Spain...

Marcus Aurelius greets them as friends, and tells them that in the whole world, only two small frontiers are still hostile to Rome... One, here in the north which separates the Roman Empire from those who are called barbarians, the other, in the east of Persia... Only on these two borders Rome is finding walls, palisades, forts and hatred... But these are not the frontiers he wants... He wants and needs human frontiers, the vision of a family of nations...

For the great emperor time is short, and there is a decision which he can no longer delay... He has sacrificed the love of his son as Commodus will never be his heir... His wish is that Livius, the commander of the northern army, should succeed him, and he intends to present him to the leaders of the empire openly as his successor... He has hope that the position and responsibilities would make his son grow up as Commodus is interested only in games and gladiators...

Guiness' ailing Marcus Aurelius had hope that his daughter would not have a marriage without love... And he knows better than anyone what a marriage without love can mean... But his fears for the empire are reasonable... The east is where the danger lies...He must make an alliance that will show the whole world what value Rome place on her eastern frontier... An alliance with Armenia...

Boyd's weary Galius Livius saw suddenly his world has become strange... He's not sure where he is... He knows only the ways of war... He would not know how to make allies out of the barbarians... But if he has to choose between being Caesar's heir or Lucilla's love, he chooses her love...

Loren's lovely Lucilla makes it hard for her father to take leave of this life... She knows that her father loves her, but how could her life mean anything without love? It is out of love that she dared so much...

Plummer's slimy Commodus pushes the eastern provinces to rebellion in smashing and destroying everything his father did... He makes it clear to his sister that he refused to give her anymore chances to prop against him...

Mason's genteel Timonides has been a slave, but he's not accustomed to pain...He is a philosopher and he is weak...

Ferrer's treacherous Cleander knows that Caesar will accept fruit from him... He also knows that his blade carries a deadly poison...

Quayle's gladiator Verulus snores, in the moment of truth, a deep family secret...

Sharif's king Sohamus hopes for a lovely part of Rome...

With a cast of thousands, massive battle sequences, exciting chariot races, brutal hand to hand combat, gorgeous scenery, impressive set design, Anthony Mann's motion picture is a long ride of epic proportions not designed only to entertain but to expose how gold and corruption can undermine the biggest empire the world has ever known...",1233446400,,3251,4.796064400715563
1197752,1,B000009O12,"Let me first preface my review by stating that the Fall of the Roman Empire is a wonderful movie. The cinematography and art direction are gorgeous. Sophia Loren is radiant. Stephen Boyd properly heroic, in spite of the bad blond hair dye. Alec Guinness, James Mason and Christopher Plummer are extraordinary.

No, my one star is not for the movie. It's for the limited edition 3 DVD set. The extras included can not justify its $39.95 price tag. The ""extra"" DVD (included only in this set) is nothing more than a collection of Encyclopedia Britannica movie shorts on Ancient Rome.

Do you remember those old (16mm) movies you watched in grammar school ? That's what they are. Those old movies. There's nothing new.

Also included are 4x6 replicas of the movie placards and program.

Are they interesting ? Yes, they are fun to look at. Are they worth the price of $39.95 ?

NO ! That's why the 3 volume limited edition set is a rip off !!!

If you are interested in this movie (and it is a good one), buy the 2 DVD  special edition DVD instead. The limited edition set is a waste of money.",1230854400,,1090,4.474747474747475
1197753,2,B000009O12,"Anthony Mann apparently never saw a procession he didn't like.  This bloated epic draws out everything almost beyond endurance (how many footsoldiers slogging by does one need to see to get the idea that they're on the march?).  Battle scenes are incoherent, so we have no idea what's supposed to be happening.  The actors were apparently told that the high import of the project required ""serious"" performances, which translates as awkward, wooden and dead.  Christopher Plummer does his best to inject some life into the proceedings, but it's pretty much a lost cause.  The sets are stunning (and you get a lot of time to look at them), the costumes avoid most of the pitfalls of the genre (no torpedo bras under the women's tunics), but the musical score (by Dmitri Tomkin) drives the final nail into the coffin -- apparently hoping to stand apart from the simulated antiquity of Rosza's scores for ""Quo Vadis,"" ""Ben-Hur"" and ""King of Kings,"" Tomkin creates a ponderous classical score that would better suit a film set in Austria in the 1800s.  It's intrusive, banal and totally wrong for the period the visuals work so hard to make credible.  All in all, a major disappointment.

1197756,4,B000009O12,"At times when the epic was often ""mere spectacle,"" this is an attempt of taking history seriously, dissecting the real causes of the decline of the greatest empire in the ancient world. Thouh only semi-historical, with fictional elements and characters, it makes a point, that the fall of a great empire is a result of many causes, but essentially it is a decay from within that brings it about. Rome had five great emperors in succession, from Hadrian to Marcus Aurelius, in a span of two centiries, but subseuently fell into the hands of icompetent egomaniacs whose concept of Rome was based on central power and exploitation, rather than sharing its wealth and privileges with other peoples.
Though slow-paced and lacking in excitement and the dramatic action of some of its predecessors (Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia), this majestic film makes up in depth of concept and characterization. It studiously avoids compromise and makes demands on the viewer to be taken seriously as a historical and moral document that highlights themes like friendship,  treachery, ambition and a larger view of humanity under the stress of war. Its characters are fascinating, all of them played by actors lacking superstar status, with the exception of Sophia Loren. Stephen Boyd plays Livius, a powerful and principled general, who was the favorite of Marcus Aurelius to succeed him. In contrast to Ben-Hur, where he plays a villain, here he is shown as a good man, and he succeeds admirably in demonstrating his range. Livius sticks to principles and despises Commodus, an ex-friend, but his is unwilling to betray him when the latter subverts his father's will and takes over a Caesar. Christopher Plummer as Commodus displays his versatility in shifting from the noble aristocrat of The Sound of Music to a despicable egomaniac who single-handedly undoes the life-long struggle of his father to instill the concept of peace and equality among a vast number of national entities that comprise the mosaic of the Empire. Plummer gives us a mad Commoddus with the same gusto that Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov gave us colorful renditions of Nero. And Sophia Loren, who hardly ever gave a bad performance, is quietly effective as Commodus's sister Lucilla, who is in love with and shares the principles of Livius. And Alec Guinness effectively renders Emepror Aurelius during the latter part of his career.
A forceful movie, with a powerful message, this is a good vehicle for both entertainment and history--carefully avoiding the pitfalls of a history lessson.

The contrast between the ""old"" movies and new ones is very apparent in this particular extravaganza.  The focus is on the spectacle.  Acting, scripting and accuracy are entirely secondary though not neglected.  I like the movie and hence give it four stars but simply as entertainment.  I could not get over the set design, the cast of thousands for extras, the range of vision offered.  Modern movies use computer imagery to do this stuff.  This movie relied on the basics... if you want to portray an army, hire one... and dress them up in period costumes.

Further, in contrast to ""modern"" movie making, the moralizing is ""in your face.""  Marcus Aurelius is portrayed as pretty near a saint... modern ideas of ""freedom"" are unabashedly imposed on folks who had very little in common with them, etc.  This movie genre is ""historical myth"" and that is OK.  There is a place for myth (young Geo. Wash. chopping down that apple tree) in the communication of morals (as in the ""moral"" of the story) and its force should not be underestimated.  An entire generation grew up watching this type of movie and on the whole, I think it was probably a more healthy environment for them than some of the modern stuff the young folks are exposed to now.

So... if you like old movies... this is a good one.",1214265600,,1334,4.601694915254237

1197766,4,B000009O12,"The Fall of the Roman Empire is one of those big Hollywood spectacle films that were so prevalent during the 50s and 60s.  It was produced by Samuel Bronston and directed by Anthony Mann who had teamed together three years earlier on another great sword and sandal epic, El-Cid.  The Fall of the Roman Empire was a disappointment at the box-office in large part due to its lack of a big star in the male lead role.  Charlton Heston turned down the role as he despised Sophia Loren who plays the female lead Lucilla.  Kirk Douglas also turned down the lead role of Livius that eventually went to Stephen Boyd.  Boyd was a very capable actor but didn't have the sizzle of a Heston or Douglas.  Besides Boyd and Loren, the cast also includes Alec Guiness (Caesar Marcus Aurelius), James Mason (Timonides), Christopher Plummer (Commodus), Omar Sharif (Sohamus), Anthony Quayle (Verulus) and John Ireland (Ballomar).

Surprisingly, the film is historically accurate on a number of different counts.  While the Livius character is fictional, Marcus Aurelius was rumored to have been poisoned, Commodus had a well documented love for the gladiatorial games, and his sister, Lucilla, did oppose his rule and attempt to assassinate him (Although this would be cut from the film so it did not make Loren's character look bad).  Many of the minor supporting characters are also based in historical fact.  The film opens at a Roman fortification along the Danube frontier as Roman forces battle the barbarian Germanic tribes.  Marcus Aurelius believes Rome's best option is to make peace with the Barbarians and wants their leader, Ballomar brought in to discuss terms.  Commodus opposes his father's views leading to Marcus naming Livius as heir to be the next Caesar instead of his own son.  But before he can document his will, Marcus is poisoned by conspirators and Commodus becomes the next Caesar.

Commodus reverses his father's pacifist and diplomatic policies and sets out to conquer the barbarians and stirs up hostilities by taxing his allies from Armenia and Egypt.  Once like brothers, Livius and Commodus are now bitter enemies and Livius is banished to the Northern frontier as Commodus continues to abuse his powers.  Now bordering on madness, Commodus becomes a prime example of absolute power corrupting absolutely.

The Fall of the Roman Empire is a true epic spectacle in every sense of the word.  The recreation of Rome in full scale is absolutely stunning.  However, the cost of building the sets on such a massive scale coupled with the poor box-office returns resulted in financial ruin for Producer Sam Bronston and his production company was forced to file for bankruptcy.  You have to appreciate the dedication to historical accuracy, right down to the costuming as the uniforms worn by the soldiers of various nations was said to be thoroughly authentic.  Without the modern use of computer technology, the films grand ""Battle of the Four Armies"" was staged with as many as 18,000 extras.

The performances in the film are generally strong.  Boyd and Plummer definitely do their best to upstage each other and are guilty of hamming it up a bit much.  On the other hand, Alec Guinness is outstanding as a serene and intelligent Marcus Aurelius.  His calm wisdom will make modern fans think of his more famous role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films.  Loren gives an understated performance and she's miles away from the sex queen idol roles she'd become known for most.

You actually do see every dollar spent on this production! The more often I watch this movie the more I love it, meanwhile preferring it even to Ben-Hur!
However the print used for this transfer was a 35mm print (as it was with El Cid), not a 70mm Ultra-Panavision print that would have presented the movie in all of its ribbon-like glory (as shown in the DVD release of the above mentioned Ben Hur, another Ultra-Panavision movie).
Unfortunately there is still one scene missing I saw years ago in a movie theater: after Livius' and Commodus' celebration of their first encounter (the wine-drinking contest) and their dilemma-discussion they climb a staircase. The lost scene shows the two men entering a viewing platform to look down into some kind of hurdling containing captured barbarian women. The next scene shows Commodus molesting one of these women. It is just a one-minute scene but it contains some cold-blooded dialogue by Commodus and its loss is indicated by an odd break in the music.

cinematic Roman clunkers such as ""Quo Vadis?"" and ""Cleopatra."" In fact, and in retrospect, ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" is the screen's first modern epic: literate, thoughtful, contemporary in its themes and flawlessly acted.  Only ""Spartacus"" and the epics of David Lean rival it today.  The four primary leads, Stephen Boyd, Sophia Loren, Christopher Plummer, and Alec Guinness, deliver Oscar worthy performances.  They remind us that today's ""A List"" of screen actors is a very anemic bunch when compared to their 1960s counterparts.  Dimitri Tiomkin's score stands alone as a masterpiece.  When the score is blended with director Anthony Mann's visuals of the cast and incomparable sets, the results are breathtaking.  The modern resonance of the movie's themes is emphasized within Alec Guinness' speech about the Pax Romana, and the struggle of the two principal characters (Boyd and Loren) to establish thoughtful government over brute force is a noteworthy reminder of a current and everlasting conflict. Boyd got his heroic role in ""Fall"" thanks, in part, to his magnificent work in William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur.""  It was inevitable that Boyd's chariot race against Christopher Plummer would be compared to the spectacular Roman Circus sequence in ""Ben-Hur.""  Whereas the race in ""Hur"" is added for spectacle, the chariot race in ""Fall"" advances the plot.  Therefore, the two should not be compared, and the chariot sequence in ""Fall"" must be applauded for its contribution to the movie's complex dramatic canvas.  The race represents the eruption of tempers and differences between Boyd (Livius) and Plummer (Commodus) with an action sequence that is both essential and entertaining for the audience.  It is merely one example of the many components that make ""Fall"" a superior motion picture experience today.  The Miriam Collection is also to be applauded for preserving and restoring this definitive classic of the 1960s, the only Roman film epic of the era that endures with themes of critical, current importance.",1210982400,,2099,5.327272727272727

1197782,4,B000009O12,"This lumbering, overlong epic contains only a few shreds of historical accuracy, along with some appallingly bad acting and a musical score that is notorious for being both inappropriate and intrusive.  Why then is it so enjoyable?

When I saw this first-run, at the age of ten, I couldn't have imagined a more enthralling movie.  My childhood memories have stayed with me and to some extent influence my response to the film today.  But there's more than that.

Christopher Plummer is brilliant as the young Emperor Commodus, whose reign begins Edward Gibbon's mammoth history, THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  As in the later GLADIATOR, Commodus is the dissolute son of the wise Marcus Aurelius.  In real life, the great Marcus was blind to his son's defects and broke with precedent by allowing Commodus to become his successor.  For more than a century, the Empire had prospered because the Emperors picked the most qualified men as their heirs, and ignored heredity.  Marcus Aurelius inexplicably chose to go back to a hereditary monarchy, with disastrous results.

Plummer's depiction of Commodus is nothing short of remarkable.  He shares several scenes with Stephen Boyd, who gives possibly the most wooden, lifeless, oxlike performance in film history, as the fictional Livius.  Boyd's lines fall out of his mouth like bars of lead dropping off a shelf.  Even so, Plummer brings the screen alive.

Sophia Loren, forced to endure several badly written love scenes with the hapless Boyd, is wasted here; these romantic scenes impressed me when I was ten, but not any more.  Loren is a brilliant actress, but she is given little to do here but look mouth-wateringly good.  Having to act opposite Boyd must have been a challenge.

Alec Guiness does what he can with the role of Marcus, which here is underwritten (he spends most of his on-screen time either philosphizing or dying).  James Mason does typically solid work as one of Marcus's advisers, and Anthony Quayle uses his few scenes to good advantage.

The real stars of the show, however, are the sets.  Two massive sets, one of Marcus's fortress on the German border, the other an astonishingly detailed recreation of the Roman forum, including several elaborate interiors, bring the spectacle to the forefront.  The first half of the film takes place on the frontier, and although there are some deathly slow sequences, the pace is helped by the brooding atmospherics of the production design, along with a battle scene and a chariot race (Boyd has the white horses this time around).

Things pick up in the second half as the action moves to Rome.  The set alone is worth the price of admission, but the story moves along at a nice clip.  None of the events are historical, but it's all entertaining, and it does manage to capture the feel of an Empire on the edge of collapse.  (The Empire actually lasted for more than 200 years after the time of Commodus, and continued in the East until 1453.  But let's not get too technical. If you want a history lesson, read a book.)

It's worth sitting through, if you can stomach Boyd. He looks for all the world like a slow-witted reptile who has just been shot between the eyes and is already dead, but is simply too stupid to have realized it yet.  It's astonishing how bad he is, especially if you've seen him in BEN HUR or ABANDON SHIP.  Perhaps he just wasn't cut out to be an action hero.

Modern audiences will likely prefer Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR, which is more briskly paced and has a more coherent plot.  But for me, the edge goes to the vivid reality of the old-fashioned spectacle, because what you're seeing really exists, and so far no computer-generated imagery can live up to reality.",1209945600,,3722,4.80503144654088

1197784,4,B000009O12,"""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" is interesting as one of the last of the great Roman epics (which is ironic, given its title).

The story has been discussed repeatedly, but there are a few holes in the story. We aren't exactly sure how James Mason's character (the Greek philosopher) rises to prominence with Flavius (Stephen Boyd), or how Flavius gains such favor with Marcus Aurelius (a very sympathetic Alec Guiness, who is absolutely wonderful), or the bit with Sophia Loren being forced into a loveless marriage, or exactly why Commodus sacks the (at this point) peaceful Barbarian village. Perhaps this is included in the recently-found lost footage that the special features mentions, but was not yet included in this set.

This aside, it is the action, suspense, and spectacular scenery that made this genre of films so successful. The chariot battle in the woods between Flavius and Commodus is particularly exciting. Sophia Loren's tender relationship with her father (Alec Guiness) is particularly touching and the musical score is perfectly fitting. Some fiction mixed with fact as expected (certain major characters aside from the Historical Marcus Aurelius and Commodus are fictional), but it makes you want to read and learn more about the real fall of Rome.

It's not hard to understand why the film flopped in 1964. The film's theme of murderous treachery and absolute power corrupting absolutely is a bit dark for a time when audiences flocked to lighter, escapist fare such as ""My Fair Lady,"" Mary Poppins,"" and ""A Hard Day's Night."" By the end of the 1960s and early 70s when certain events in America paralelled the actions of Ancient Rome in the film (needless wars for expansionism, corrupt leadership, and moral decay among the populace-HEY! Sounds like  NOW!), it became common to compare the fate of America to the Roman Empire. This movie will really make you think as you watch it and ponder the events of our own time.

Its scope is such that one wishes it was left intact and reused as a theme park (think ""FutureWorld"" --or maybe not!). Also, those who have grown up on CGI movie armies ought to be knocked out that, at one time, hundreds of real people, all in costume, stood on real ground wielding real prop weapons in choreographed battles. The difference between these shots and the very best of today's computer images is readily apparent and palpable. (And unlike most epics of the time, Director Mann keeps his camera in motion, maximizing the depth of the picture.)

Despite the visual splendor, ""Empire"" just falls short of being successful. Unlike ""Cleopatra,"" whose failings are more readily apparent,  something feels just a little off. The pacing would seem to be the culprit (""Empire"" doesn't move along, doesn't have the ""snap"" of, say, ""Ben Hur"" or ""Spartacus""); perhaps it's that we don't always get the most interesting story elements (whatever those may be). In any case, ""The Fall Of The Roman Empire,"" while not neccesarily a classic, provides a rich and ultimately satisfying movie-going experience.

As far as the overall package goes, this is a really nice set that puts the Weinstein Company in the big leagues with Warner Home Video and TCM.",1209600000,,1554,4.9653846153846155
1197786,3,B000009O12,"In my opinion, Dimitri Tiomkin's musical score for The Fall of The Roman Empire is too modern and not quite appropriate for this epic film.  Don't take me wrong, Dimitri Tiomkin is one of my favorite film composers; however, I'm not particularly happy with this film's musical score.  Because of its score, I'll have a hard time to watch this film again for a long time.  I think when a score is not quite appropriate, the quality of even a good film diminishes greatly.  I believe if Miklos Rozsa had scored this film, it would've been a much more watchable film.",1209600000,,564,4.554455445544554

FIRST OF ALL, THE LIMITED, COLLECTOR'S EDITION ACTUALLY HAS THREE DISCS!

I have been waiting for the new DVD set of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" for a long time ever since I had to put up with the less-than-satisfactory, inexpensive import DVD (which I fed to the lions!) that was the only available DVD of this film prior to the Miriam release. It's a spectacular film about the Roman Empire, but what really makes this film remarkable is the sheer scope about how it was filmed back then.  Besides the grade-A cast of stars, it was the magnificent sets, lavish costumes and thousands of extras that contributed to the epic's stature. In the modern age of computer generated graphics and special effects, it's always refreshing to look at classic films that had to do things the ""old-fashioned"" way.

I like this movie, but the dilemma that came up when I purchased the Miriam DVD set was which one do I buy?  After considering the two disc set, I bought the limited collector set with the extra goodies. There was only a $10 difference from the store I bought it from, so it was up to me to see if the difference was worth it. Hard to complain for a measly ten bucks but here it goes. Keep in mind both sets have two identical DVD's but the limited collector set differs in the following;

First of all the limited collector set is packaged in a decent, but modest-sized, cardboard box.  The same size box if you own any other Miriam titles such as ""El Cid"". Thankfully, not an oversized box like the ""Bladerunner"" briefcase or the ""Battlestar Galactica"" cylon-head box (which are cool by the way, but awkward). Inside the box are a nice set of six production stills which look like mini lobby cards. The booklet is described as a reproduction of the 1964 program. Its 32 pages are filled with mostly color and some b&w photographs. Text about the film's production are on only about five or six pages so the whole book is pretty much a picture book. The DVD's are packaged in the same, snap-plastic DVD case as the two disc set, but the third disc exclusive to this set is packaged inside. A double disc swinging tray is inserted to hold all three discs. There are three discs even though the DVD's outer-case insert indicates two discs (but the outer box indicates three discs, confusing eh?).

The third disc primarily contains short films produced by the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1964 about the history of Rome. Specifically about 1) Life in Ancient Rome (13 minutes), 2) Julius Caesar: Rise of the Roman Empire (21 minutes) and 3) Claudius: boy of Ancient Rome (16 minutes).  There are two brief introductions by the director, Bill Deneen (in modern day) and a vintage introduction (from 1964). Both intros are about three minutes each. The short films are educational in nature and they are filmed on the incredible ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" sets. None of the feature film actors are in these film shorts.  The actors portrayed have some ""wooden"" performances, but the ""mini"" films have interesting content complete with informative narration and limited, actor dialogue. Although the acting in these mini films are so so which wasn't the intent of these educational minis, the sets are still wonderful to look at. You have to give Encyclopedia Britannica credit for being able to take advantage of all the props and sets to accomodate their educational and informative tasks in 1964. Overall the Britannica mini-films look like the type of films you might have slept through when you were in high school, but as an adult now they are very interesting to me. Certainly all of the films are short enough to see in a one, short viewing. In fact, I recommend that the third disc is viewed prior to watching the feature film.

In conclusion I recommend the collector set only if you are willing to learn a little more about Rome besides the nice documentaries and behind-the-scenes already included in the two-disc set. It was purely a stroke of genius for the Encyclopedia Britannica to have the incredible resources provided to them by the ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" film crew at their disposal in 1964. I think it is disappointing that the viewing time on the third disc is only about an hour long, but the mini films are interesting for some of the historical facts dramatized in an educational format that you or others (maybe your kids?) can enjoy again and again in just a short viewing. The physical extras are nice to look at and then stash away, but the third disc has some invaluable information for those that are curious and want some more insights about one of the most fascinating empires of all time.",1209513600,,4948,4.935096153846154
1197788,4,B000009O12,"The Fall of the Roman Empire is everything you'd expect from a film of this type: pretentious dialogue, a bombastic soundtrack, exciting battles on a grand scale, plenty of scenery-chewing performances, and vast sets rendered to historical accuracy. They really don't make films like this anymore and that's a shame because there is something personal and intimate about it despite the epic scale that is missing from the epics of today which rely too much on CGI to do the heavy lifting. Maybe it is the hand-made sets of Anthony Mann's film that give it a more human feel than the often cold, distant feel of computer generated landscapes that dominate the films of today, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

The first disc features an audio commentary by Bill Bronston, son of the film's producer, and Mel Martin, author of a book about the films of Bronston. Martin claims that no opticals or special effects were used and so all of the sets were real and built to scale. Bronston says that many of the extras were in fact tourists often recruited for a day's work. Naturally, they touch upon the costume and production design and marvel at the scale, pointing out how it was all made from scratch. There are several lulls but considering that the commentary runs for almost three hours Bronston and Martin deliver an engaging and informative commentary.

""Rome in Madrid: 1964 Promo Film"" is a fantastic, vintage featurette narrated by James Mason as he takes us through how the film came together. We see how the elaborate sets were constructed. We see the costumes being designed, weapons built, and the film's stars in costume tests. There's even an amusing bit with Guinness and Plummer playing a game of chess between takes. This is a good extra that is much more entertaining than the usual making of featurettes you find on DVDs.

Also included is a vintage trailer for the film from back in the day.

There is a ""Stills Galleries"" with behind-the-scenes photographs, a collection of lobby cards, and several theatrical posters.

There are ""Filmographies"" for the cast that is nothing you couldn't find on the Internet Movie Database.

The third disc includes the ""Encyclopaedia Britannica: Educational Shorts about the Roman Empire."" These are three featurettes that examine the historical fact about the events depicted in the film. There are recreations of Roman History shot on the actual sets of Anthony Mann's film mixed with clips from the film itself. This extra provides a fascinating backstory to what is depicted in the film.",1209340800,,2699,5.265116279069767
1197789,5,B000009O12,"I have been waiting for this title for some time now. In fact a few years ago I found out that none other than Disney, that is Buena Vista, had the rights to this title as well as El Cid, and 55 Days. I was calling up their 800 number in Wisconsin about every 6 months or so to see if any thing was in the works for the release of this title.  The answer was always NO, not yet. And they STILL don`t seem to know anything about it, when I called them again after I saw El Cid on a shelf at Walmart. Well, anyway, Me so HAPPY that it is finallllly coming out, a week from today. I just went to dvdempire.com to check out the details on the Collector`s Edition, and was surprised to see that there is a THIRD disc, that is only included in the Collector`s Edition, which includes clips from other historical Roman films that used the same sets as this film.(?). Does anybody know anything about about this extra disc, and what it might include? I was going to purchase the less expensive Deluxe Edition, because I was going to pass on the reproduction of the original release booklet, and the lobby cards, but if there is a third disc involved, I might just shell out the extra $ for it. I went to read the reviews of the Collector`s Edition of El Cid, and it seems that nobody was raving about the extras in that Collector`s Edition (was there a third disc in that set also?), so a booklet reproduction and some lobby cards alone just don`t do it for me. Can someone please shed some light on the special extras that are included not only for The Fall Of The Roman Empire, but also on the El Cid Collector`s Editions. Thank you.",1208822400,,1627,4.214743589743589
1197790,5,B000009O12,"NOTE: THIS IS THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION OF THE SAME FILM COSTING $10.00 LESS.
You should also note that there has been a number of blogs on the internet that suggest 30 minutes of lost film of the movie have been discovered.  Whether or not this Collector's Edition will include that footage is unknown.  It is highly doubtful that the lost footage is included in this edition as the running time indicated on the DVD is exactly the same as the standard version.  Nevertheless, the film does not need additional footage to change my rating of this film.  5-Stars.

If you enjoyed Gladiator with Russell Crow you will undoubtedly enjoy this film for the simple fact that the story line is the same.

Story Line: Decadence of Rome after the death of Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness); the fall from grace of Rome's greatest general (Stephen Boyd); romance between the general and the emperor's daughter (Sophia Loren); and the struggle for power between the general and Commodus, (Christopher Plummer).

There is a lot more attention to detail in Fall of the Roman Empire with more plot twists and character development than Gladiator, although slower in pace. By no means is the story slow or uninteresting, just more drama and less video action - for the mature adult who appreciates plot development before the action begins.

This film was made with the same mindset as films like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and Ten Commandments, meaning; huge budgets, a massive sets, cast of thousands and costume designs that surpasses any film of its time. Along with all this you get one of the finest casts ever assembled. There are no computer generated images in this film so the thousands and thousands of extras you see in this film are real!

See this film on the largest TV screen you can get your hands on and get ready to be impressed.

1197791,5,B000009O12,"FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is one of the most underrated film epics of all time. It has a very intelligent script, witty dialogue and an insightful sense of humor (the intellectually amusing banter between Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius and James Mason as Timonides is far above that found in biblical type epics). The cast is impressive including Sophia Loren, Anthony Quail, John Ireland, Omar Sharif and Mel Ferrer (probably his best screen performance as the blind and deceitful Cleander). James Mason gives a lesson in histrionics giving yet another brilliant performance unlike anything he had done previously.

Robert Krasker's cinematography especially filmed on the frozen frontier with the ominous forest in the background and snowflakes blustering across the screen are astonishingly atmospheric combined with one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most impressionistic, elegiac and enigmatic scores. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is lush and beautifully haunting throughout. The action sequences are impressively staged. The chariot chase on the frontier road and downhill through the pines between the stoic Stephen Boyd (Livius) and a very flamboyantly psychotic Christopher Plumber (Commodus) is a highlight. Most impressive are the outstanding and unbelievable sets by production designers Veniero Colasanti and John Moore.

Director Anthony Mann has a great ability to use outdoor landscapes to full advantage enhancing the drama. He contrasts the beauty of nature with unscrupulous men's desires to control their environment through manipulation and deceit against other men of greater moral fortitude. The tranquil outdoor settings are the stage for this conflict of good and evil. Unsung and most forgotten is producer Samuel Bronston who gave us great epic films as this. He had a penchant for producing grand epics (EL CID and 55 DAYS AT PEKING) that were not only opulent and stirring but were elevated to higher cinematic and artistic prominence for their intellect and thought provoking scripting and images.",1208044800,,2013,5.532467532467533
1197792,5,B000009O12,"This is a wonderfully evocative film of the period, not loud and over-scored with soundtrack. Stephen Boyd and Sophia Loren, and Christopher Plummer are all excellent, as is Alec Guinness as Marcus Aurelius.

The settings are very bleak, and the conditoin of the Roamn Empire is,  like the weather, associated with the dead and with tombs. This is the portrayal of an empire falling gradually into a maze of diversity. Rome was not prepared for this, because the empire existed by outsourcing its economy and enslaving every country or territory they occuopied. Certainly, Christianity has great significance, as the military and the barabarians the Romans war against begin to rsist and assimilate into Roman life, under the banner of Christ, because Chritianity is for all people, especially the poor.

The portrayal of the non -hero, not the anti- hero, is a trade mark of Anthony Mann, who directed this film with great artistry and breathtaking visual beauty and ugliness. Mann's characters in his superb westerns often ride off guilty, repentant, or are killed. So too here; there is a longing for peace and order that is elusive and perhaps unobtainable for Rome, given its past history of violence and enslavement of other poeples.

Empires all fall, because people don't want to be occupied and bullied, as is clearly stayed by John Ireland in the film. We hear this today in the Middle East and in Tibet. Mann knows this tendency in rich countries to becomne empires, and subsequently lose everything as culture gives way to genocide.

This is a very meditative film, not about epic incidents, although there is a chariot race, but with nothing in common with Ben Hur.

See this film, and watch the slowness of movements in it, the tiredness of empire, the absudity of power and the results of violence.",1207612800,,1813,4.947368421052632
1197793,5,B000009O12,"There's an old saying that you leave the best until last. With roman epic movies this is certainly true of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"".

Every other modern roman epic you can think of (Ben Hur, Gladiator, 2 different versions of Spartacus, The Robe, Demetrius & the Gladiators, Quo Vadis, Caligula, Cleopatra, Barabbas, Greatest Story Ever Told and the Rome tv series) have all been released on dvd long ago (most with 2 disc special versions). Well in my opinion this film is the very best of this genre in terms of sheer spectacle and intelligence if not entertainment value. It was the last (released in 1964) gigantic epic spectacular in the roman epic genre (until ""Gladiator"" arrived in 2000) with the possible exception of ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" one year later in 1965 but that film was more a biblical epic than roman epic (though it featured many aspects of ancient roman culture). Both films (i.e. ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" & ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"") were shot in 70mm Ultra Panavision widescreen format (65mm negative & 2.75:1 aspect ratio) & Technicolour with gigantic sets purpose built especially for the production. Both films seemed to suffer the same fate at the box office and, whilst very popular in some regions of the world (Europe & Australia/New Zealand), they overall failed to recoup a sizeable part of their production costs at the box office. Both films together had a world-wide combined gross of tens of millions of dollars between them at the world box office and in ""Fall's"" case certainly much, much more than the 1/2 million dollars one reviewer suggested (""Fall"" grossed nearly 5 million dollars in USA alone so 1/2 million dollars gross in USA alone is just wrong---source: IMDB). ""Fall"" was much more popular and indeed a financial success in Europe after it's woefully disappointing USA release (especially Great Britain where The Rank Organization had been a large investor in the movie--2.5 million pounds or $7.5 million USA--source: Miriam Collection dvd interview with script writer Philip Yordan--and obviously gave this movie a premium release in the United Kingdom to recover their substantial costs which amounted to approximately 1/3 of the film's budget ) and Australia /New Zealand (again distributed by a Rank Organization subsisidiary there) but not in USA where, as the world's major market for these historical epics, ""Fall"" needed to be successful to recoup its enormous cost (new information from Mel Martin's biography of Samuel Bronston now estimates the cost in 1963/1964 at $28 million USA which is the current equivalent of approximately $280 million USA--by comparison ""Titanic"" cost approximately $200 million USA--making ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" one of the most expensive films ever made--in the same league as ""Cleopatra""). By comparison the 1959  version of ""Ben-Hur"" cost 16 million USA and was the costliest film of all time up to that point (1959) and had a worldwide gross of $145 million USA. In today's values, adjusted for inflation, that equates to at least $150 million USA cost and at least $1.45 billion USA gross income. Obviously the golden success that all epic film producers thereafter wanted to achieve for their historical epics.

""Fall"" has also been dubbed ""The Fall of the Roman Epic"" by some cynical critics as it was the film that virtually bankrupted its producer Samuel Bronston due to its enormous cost and Bronston's legendary overspending (""money is no object"") which included the brand new (in 1963/64) Samuel Bronston studios complex in Madrid and financing his 1964 ""Circus World"" production all at the same time. It's recently been revealed in Mel Martin's book ""The Magnificent Showman"" that ""Fall"" actually cost $28 million USA in total which is much higher than the previously quoted $16 million to $20 million USA which makes ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" one of the most expensive films ever produced--$28 million USA dollars in 1963 (production year) is the equivalent of approx. $280 million USA dollars now. That is a budget higher than that of ""Titanic"" ($200 million USA dollars) or maybe even ""Avatar"" (estimated cost: $250 million). It's now easy to understand why this film did not recoup its production costs given the huge amount it would have to gross at the world box office to just break even. It's 1964/1965 box office failure convinced every other Hollywood studio to stop making roman epics. ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" in March 1964 (when ""Fall"" was first released) had nearly finished shooting so it was too late to stop production of that film. Again ""Greatest Story's"" 1965/1966 box office failure convinced every Hollywood studio to stop making roman-themed biblical epics (especially as the studio financing ""Greatest Story""--United Artists--were making a fortune from the James Bond, Pink Panther & Clint Eastwood spaghetti western series and didn't want to lose any more money on perceived 1950's concepts like roman epics). As the song says ""the times were a changing"".  At the recently revealed cost of $28 million American dollars in 1964 money terms ""Fall"" would have to have been one of the top 10 highest grossing films of all time to just recoup its costs so it was obviously a labour of love for producer Samuel Bronston but not a very wise commercial decision. It is second only to ""Cleopatra"" (cost: $44 million USA) as the costliest Hollywood-style spectacular epic film up to 1964. ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" in 1965 cost 20 million USA and arguably suffered a similar fate for similar reasons. By comparison ""Ben Hur"" in 1958/59 cost $16 million USA and was the costliest film ever made up to that point but then became the biggest grossing film of all time up to that point. Which probably explains the reason why so many epic film producers took the risk to try to replicate Ben-Hur's financial success in the early 1960's.

Some people (myself included) regard ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" as Bronston's very best film. However the exorbitantly enormous budget was extremely well spent with absolutely awe-inspiring sets, stunning cinematography, superb production design & costumes plus excellent performances from the impressive cast (though this is extremely debatable depending upon your preferences). Most notably (in my opinion) Alec Guinness as emperor Marcus Aurelius who gives a very shakespearean feel to his performance in the earlier part of the film with his very Hamlet-like soliloquies (basically a stage device where an actor talks out loud to him or her self to give the audience some idea of their thought processes). Guinness's dialogue here used many of the actual words from the meditations of the real emperor Marcus Aurelius. This shakespearean influence is hardly surprising as a younger Alec Guinness understudied the great Laurence Olivier as ""Hamlet"" on the London stage earlier in his career. Apparently Guinness also rewrote some of his own dialogue as he was not overly impressed by the original script and he obviously inserted this shakespearean influence into his scenes. Incidentally according to director Anthony Mann the script was rewritten 6 times to ""get it right"".

By the way the forum set built especially for this film still holds the world record for the biggest ""purpose-built"" set for a movie (these buildings were 3 dimensional with roofs which allowed many varied camera angles & not just a frontal facade with scaffolding at the back--it's now been revealed that they also had fitted-out interiors with actual props such as thrones and statues etc). This forum set (the largest of the sets built in Madrid, Spain especially for this film) was mostly demolished soon after filming finished although ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to The Forum"" (filmed in 1965 but released in 1966) utilized some of the still standing smaller sets (which were muddied up to look ""lived-in""). Bronston apparently didn't want another lesser, inferior movie production to use his magnificent forum set. The limited edition dvd contains some ""encyclopaedia brittanica"" short films shot mainly on the roman forum set shortly after the ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" finished filming. However the difference in quality of these films and the actual movie is significant and this may be the reason Bronston did not want his forum set used again so he had it demolished (a very bad decision as it turns out--imagine the revenue to be gained from tourists in some sort of theme park with this set as the major attraction--it might have been enough over the years to see the film finally in profit).

Presumably Bronston had expected to top the size & grandeur of this forum set with a bigger set in his next production but this did not eventuate as 1964's ""Circus World"" had a far smaller budget (due to ""Fall's"" box office failure and severe problems with financial backers) and mostly used real circuses as its backgrounds. Bronston's sporadic films as producer after this were all much, much smaller in concept and budget (""Savage Pampas"", ""Dr. Copelius"" and ""Fort Saganne""). The sets in ""Troy"" (2004) embellished an existing 16th century fortress in Malta to stand in for the city of Troy (with some digital enhancement) and the set was not ""purpose built"" as such. Of course most of the soldiers in the TROY battle scenes were computer generated. This ""Fall"" dvd is worth buying just for the sheer magnificence of the real sets & production design as well as the huge crowd scenes (real people not CGI special effects) notwithstanding some people's adverse opinions of the acting. In the battle of the 4 armies sequence (after intermission) approximately 8,000 extras (a large portion of the mounted soldiers being from General Franco's Spanish Army) portrayed the soldiers. That's EIGHT THOUSAND REAL PEOPLE IN ONE SEQUENCE which was a record for that time later surpassed by ""Gandhi"" in 1983. Obviously the ""Fall"" costume budget was a large part of the overall budget.

""Fall"" especially has been very sadly neglected in terms of dvd release with mainly cheaply produced & inferior quality Asian versions available (except for the French & Australian versions which are reasonably high quality discs but with little or no extras in english). Finally and at last the Weinstein organisation of USA has seen fit to give the remaining Samuel Bronston productions that are still not on dvd (i.e. most of them) the quality dvd release that they deserve especially ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" with outstanding extras & the very exciting prospect of an additional 30-35 minutes of unseen footage (rumoured to be on the ""55 Days at Peking"" dvd). I do hope that any extra scenes include the long deleted & little seen ""trilemma"" sequence (if you're a fan of this particular film you'll know exactly what scene this is and what the significance of this scene in the film is---it explains why emperor Commodus always uses the words ""if you listen carefully you will hear the gods laughing""). However there's also evidence of some other missing footage (stills of Finlay Currie's senator being murdered by Eric Porter's senator in the latter part of the film) in the original souvenir program and it would be fascinating for film buffs to see the restored scenes on dvd in what would be a nearly 4 hour ""Fall"". However this version could become the sort of 4 hour plus endurance test that the current incomplete version of ""Cleopatra"" remains (apparently there are still 2 hours of missing footage from ""Cleopatra"" in addition to the current 250 minute version). Perhaps they were correct to edit out the rumoured 30-35 minutes of now missing footage from the original ""Fall"" 70mm roadshow version. But it is a fascinating prospect for most film buffs to see this complete version who I'm sure would all buy at least one copy which would make it a worthwhile commercial venture (especially in blue ray). This could be marketed as the ""director's original cut"" of this film which those insiders involved with the film's production in 1963 quote as being superior to the already released ""full length"" version.

I expect that the Weinstein organisation will be surprised & delighted to discover that this film perhaps more than most of the other Samuel Bronston productions has many more fans than expected who will hopefully all support what looks like a first class, quality dvd release of this film by buying at least one copy & perhaps the collector's edition as well. As the title Collector's LIMITED EDITION implies there will only be a certain number of this LIMITED EDITION available and once they are all sold no more can be obtained (except for second hand). With extras like 6 lobby cards (i.e. film stills usually displayed in the movie theatre lobby) and a reproduction of the original souvenir program this LIMITED EDITION (like ""El Cid"" as well) will be worth more & more money as movie memorabilia in the near future (especially the lobby cards & program). This is definitely THE EDITION to buy and a great investment for the future at $34.99 because once they're sold they aren't obtainable again except for second hand.

If sales of the 2 different dvd versions of this film are beyond expectations fans of this film could well expect the eventual appearance of the ""ultimate"" version--a blue ray dvd version with all the extras (hopefully including deleted scenes and especially the 90 second ""trilemma"" sequence). That would be simply stunning-- both in quality terms and to make up for the shameful neglect and lack of respect over the years for a truly great film producer--Samuel Bronston. Hooray for the Weinstein organisation for having the courage and business sense to release these films in quality versions!

By the way the official running time for this film in its original roadshow version IS 188 minutes (including overture, intermission & exit music) and the aspect ratio of Ultra  Panavision (in which format this film was photographed) is 2.75:1 not 2.35:1 (I have the original pressbook) so let's hope that this version does justice to the pristine  images of the original roadshow version. I'm sure it will.

Lastly no mention of Sophia Loren, Christopher Plummer and Omar Sharif was made by anyone discussing this dvd. Their insights into the production would be absolutely fascinating (although Bill Bronston & Mel Martin's insights into the movie's production are fascinating). After all, these 3 actors are the PRINCIPAL LIVING ACTORS that appeared in this movie (Mel Ferrer died recently in his 90's) and were there during most if not all of the movie's shooting schedule so they above all others should know the movie's background and have fascinating anecdotes to offer. One item being that Sophia Loren hosted spaghetti parties for the cast & crew at her apartment when not filming (this anecdote is in the original press book). Needless to say what happens when any of these actors dies--- A VITAL OPPORTUNITY MISSED.

POST SCRIPT: It's now 2017 and the Weinstein Organization have still not offered a blue ray version of this film in USA even though German, French, British and Spanish blue ray versions have been released using the same Weinstein USA dvd version and extras but again WITHOUT THE ""TRILEMMA"" 90 second sequence which actually IS AVAILABLE to the Weinstein organisation and could easily be inserted into the current version. Maybe their grand scheme of offering these specialty films under their mother's name of Miriam hasn't quite worked out as expected. I do think they owe it to their loyal fans (you know the people who actually pay money for these products and appreciate them) to include all of the extra material that they have with this film and any others they own on any future releases ESPECIALLY BLUE RAY RELEASES in USA. I think their mother Miriam would be proud of them for making their loyal fan base happy in this way. However if they've gone cold on releasing these films themselves maybe they could sell the rights to Time/Warner who have done an absolutely magnificent job of enhancing Bronston's ""King of Kings"" on blue ray disc to make it look like this movie was actually filmed quite recently (not 50 years ago). The same holds true for Warner's absolutely magnificent blue ray release of ""Ben Hur"" with a frame by frame enhancement of the original 65mm negative in the original format and ratio--namely Camera 65/Ultra Panavision in 2.75:1 ratio and not 2.35:1 ratio. It looks like a brand new film and not one made 55 years ago. Time/Warner could combine ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" with ""Ben Hur"", ""King of Kings"" and ""Quo Vadis"" to form an interesting roman epic dvd/blue ray set. Or a Samuel Bronston set featuring ""King of Kings"", ""El Cid"", ""55 Days at Peking"", ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" and ""Circus World"" with even maybe ""John Paul Jones"" for good measure. Both of these sets would be truly spectacular entertainment and great value combined in the one package. I'm sure sales would justify these films being combined in this way.
It now appears that the Weinstein organisation have sold off their interest in the Miriam Collection and associated dvds to Anchor Bay. Anchor Bay have released a 172 minute version of this film in Great Britain but still not in USA. Blue Ray versions are available in all of Europe, Asia and Oceania but still not in USA. The region B blue ray will not play on USA/Canada Region A blue ray players. Maybe someone at Anchor Bay should make a region A or region free version of this film available with the full 188 minute version which should include the 90 second ""trilemma"" sequence which is still missing from every available version of this film.",1206057600,,17687,4.976665539398039

1197795,4,B000009O12,"Released one year after ""Cleopatra,"" Anthony Mann's ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) is not a great film, but is noteworthy for the quality of the production, the assemblege of a splendid cast, and the fact it truly signified the end of an era in filmmaking.

The film was remade, sort of, as ""Gladiator"" by Ridley Scott, but it is Mann's film that is far superior cinematically. What is immediately striking about ""Fall"" is the number of historically accurate sets (over 20 in all) depicting the Roman capital at the time of emperor Marcus Aurelius and Commodus all handcrafted by scores or set designers and craftsmen in Spain long before computer animation was ever heard of.

While critics at the time scoffed at the fact that a film could compress Gibbon's opus into a film over 188 minutes, Mann does succeed in capturing really the ""beginning of the end"" by depicting the frustrations of a philosophical emperor's (Marcus Aurelius) 20-year reign now in its twilight, filled with small but bitter barbarian battles and frontier wars, who leaves behind a spoiled and twisted son (Commodus) who squanders such ideals and leaves the empire in chaos.

Spending much of his $16 million budgeted for the film on sets (an enormous amount of money circa 1964), we see a vision of Mann's Rome (and the Roman Forum), not only architectually accurate but of tremendous breadth and scope. The Temple of Vesta, the Curia, the Arch of Titus, The Temple of Jupiter, are all rendered with tremendous authenticity. Certainly, a Rome even Nero would be reluctant to burn!

Interior sets are also equally impressive decorated with garlands, frescoes, pools, and columns modelled on the Pompeian style. Like the sets, the costume design, cinematography courtesy of Dimitri Tiomkin, and even the stuntwork (overseen by Yakima Canutt), are all first class. Even noted historian, Will Durant, author of the nine volume opus, ""The Story of Civilization,"" was both a consultant and advisor for the film.

All in all, the film authentically captures all the grandeur and decadance that was Rome, so why only four stars? Perhaps the problem lies with the two leads Livius (Stephen Boyd) and Drusilla (Sophia Loren) with a love story that fails to convice and somewhat drags the principal story down. However, they manage to do what they can with these rather bland roles.

James Mason (Timonides) and Alec Guinness (Marcus Aurelius)are both impressive in their respective roles, and Christopher Plummer, plays a Commodus a bit too refined to be that sinister and half-mad, but it all seems to work apparently well in this film. The final scenes are a subtle reminder that great empires do not fall to outside foreign influences before they first fall from within.",1205280000,,2743,5.004385964912281
1197796,4,B000009O12,"At last, after so many years we can finaly enjoy ""The fall of the roman empire"" with a new restored print in sound and picture quality.

The package design looks okay from Weinstein but why don't they use the original movie poster, is still beyond me,just like ""El-Cid"".

I have some comments on this long awaited dvd. The running time is not 179 min. but 188 min. Recently they found in London (United Kingdom) 30 min of never been seen scene's by anyone, so the duration of the picture will be longer then its 188 min. I sincerely hope that Weinstein put those lost scenes in, that will be a real treat! The film was shot in Ultra Panavision which has a different aspect ratio then 2:35.1. So they properly use a Cinemascope print 35 mm for the film transfer (bad idea) to dvd instead of using a 65 mm print.

The picture gives us a good look how the fall of the roman empire took place, however they made the mistake earlier just like ""gladiator"" of some historical facts. For example: Emperor Commodus was killed in his bed and his sister Lucilla was also a monster just like him, not a sweet lady as Sophia Loren portrays

The acting of all the actors is good but Christopher Plummer steals the picture before our very eyes. He indeed becomes very slowly mad when the picture is in progress.

The sets and costumes are very impressive, I have a lot of epic films on dvd but this one (after some considaration) should have an Oscar on both subjects. The saddest thing is they didn't win any of those.

The only set back of this movie is the love affair between Stephen Boyd and Sophia Loren, when you watch them together you will get the feeling there is something missing in those scene's.

Forget those love scene's between those two actors and enjoy the rest of movie like the very good camera work, the fighting scenes by the second unit director the late Yakima Canutt, ( the battle scene's between the Romans and Persians becomes almost real no special effects shot's at all whatsoever) the music of Dimitri Tiomkin, the sets, and the costumes.

My only fear is that the Entr'act doesn't start to play after the intermission logo, and when the music ends we all have to put the second disc on the dvd disc tray to see the the rest of the movie, just as it happened with the El-Cid disc's.

Story Line: Decadence of Rome after the death of Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness); the fall from grace of Rome's greatest general (Stephen Boyd); romance between the general and the emperor's daughter (Sophia Loren); and the struggle for power between the general and Commodus, (Christopher Plummer).

There is a lot more attention to detail in Fall of the Roman Empire with more plot twists and character development than Gladiator, although slower in pace.  By no means is the story slow or uninteresting, just more drama and less video action - for the mature adult who appreciates plot development before the action begins.

This film was made with the same mindset as films like Ben-Hur, Spartacus, and Ten Commandments, meaning; huge budgets, a massive sets, cast of thousands and costume designs that surpasses any film of its time.  Along with all this you get one of the finest casts ever assembled.  There are no computer generated images in this film so the thousands and thousands of extras you see in this film are real!

See this film on the largest TV screen you can get your hands on and get ready to be impressed.

1197800,5,B000009O12,"1964's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was the last of Samuel Bronston's 'epic trilogy', three remarkable films (""Empire"", ""El Cid"", and ""55 Days in Peking""), that stand alone in their sheer opulence and spectacle. Sadly, ""Empire"" would fail at the box office, forcing Bronston to shut down much of his Madrid studio, but he was justifiably proud of the film, nonetheless; it tackled a seemingly impossible subject (the collapse of Imperial Rome) on a grand scale, with intelligence and a surprising compassion. The time frame of the film (the era of Caesars Marcus Aurelius and Commodus) would, in fact, prove so richly dramatic that Ridley Scott would return to it in ""Gladiator"", which, in many ways copies ""Empire"" (and would win the 'Best Picture' Oscar, to boot!)

The back story of ""Empire"" is every bit as remarkable as ""El Cid""; this had been a pet project of Bronston's for years, and with the backing of the Spanish government, and brilliant director Anthony Mann on board, he planned it as the follow-up to ""El Cid"", creating massive sets of both Rome and northern Europe, in Madrid, and locations throughout Spain.

Bronston felt a major male superstar would be needed for the production to 'work', and courted Charlton Heston, so memorable as ""El Cid"". But Heston felt the story paralleled much of ""Ben Hur"", and when he was informed that Sophia Loren (who he had not enjoyed working with, in ""El Cid"") would again be his leading lady, he turned the role down. Bronston, anxious to retain his services, then showed him the script of ""55 Days in Peking"" (which wouldn't involve Loren), and he expressed interest. Bronston, amazingly, tore down ALL the ""Empire"" sets, and built 'Peking', to accommodate Heston! ""Empire"" would be put on hold until ""55 Days"" was completed.

The delay would result in greater financial difficulties (as the Peking film wasn't the critical and commercial hit ""El Cid"" had been), as well as other problems. The original choice as Commodus, Richard Harris, did not get along with director Mann, and would be replaced by Christopher Plummer (Harris would eventually portray Marcus Aurelius, in ""Gladiator""). Replacing Heston as the lead would be Stephen Boyd (after Kirk Douglas turned down the role). While a very competent actor, Boyd lacked the charisma and star power to attract audiences. The production hit snags in a number of areas, further draining the strained budget. Ultimately, it would have needed to be a blockbuster to recoup the costs...and, sadly, it wasn't.

Still, the film is a joy, in many ways; Alec Guinness, as Aurelius, and James Mason, as a Greek philosopher/ex-slave, are both superb; Sophia Loren is breathtakingly beautiful; Plummer is every bit as good as Commodus as Joaquin Phoenix would be, a generation, later; the battles and Rome sequences are visually stunning; and Dimitri Tiomkin's dazzling score is one of his best.

1197814,4,B000009O12,"At long last the epic FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is becoming available in the aftermath of the release of EL CID.  This was the movie that destroyed Samuel Bronston's studio.  Much of the story would later be the basis of GLADIATOR.  A terrific cast: Stephen Boyd as Livius, Sophia Loren (was there ever a more beautiful star?) as Lucilla, Christopher Plummer (in a wonderful over the top performance) as Comodus and Sir Alec Guinness as Marcus Arilias. To this add John Ireland, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quayle, James Mason and Mel Ferrer. Colossal sets and set piece battles with thousands of extras that today could only be done by CGI, this is an epic in every sense.  A failure at the box office in it's time.  The author, John Logan, of the GLADITOR screenplay says he was unaware of this movie when he was hired by Ridley Scott. Perhaps, the stories both use the same chapter in history and real persons.  Both have Comodus die in hand to hand combat with the protagonist.  Neither is true but never let a little thing like the truth ruin an entertaining film. This appears to be the old roadshow edition with intro and exit music.  Films like this, so prevalent in the 1950's until the early 1960's are now a thing of the past. A pity, in their day they really were spectacles in the best sense.  Highly enjoyable fare!",1202860800,,1321,4.540084388185654
1197815,5,B000009O12,"The Fall of the Roman Empire is mainly remembered, if at all, for two things - being one of the biggest flops in history and for being the film that was shamelessly plagiarized by the much inferior Gladiator. Which is a great pity, because not only does the film have much to recommend it but also in many ways it's the summit of director Anthony Mann's filmmaking, putting everything he ever learned to perfect use to create a magnificently realised portrait of a very different screen Rome. Whereas mad emperors are the staple of the genre, he dispenses with the standard image of Rome as a force of evil to be resisted and replaces it with a Rome that is an idea and an ideal to be fought for: there is no triumph when this empire begins to destroy itself, only disgust at a missed opportunity for true greatness. In many ways, like El Cid, it's an extension of Mann's favorite Western theme of a corrupted man dragged to his own redemption against his wishes, kicking and screaming all the way - only this time, redemption is steadfastly resisted.

In many ways it reworks elements of El Cid - rival siblings bickering over the throne, the assassination of a ruler, even the final fight owes much to the duel for Calahorra. But unlike the Cid, Stephen Boyd's Livius is unable to truly inspire (his own army is bought off at the gates of Rome) and he leaves the Empire to its decline in chaos out of disgust: the complete antithesis of Mann's great description of the appeal of the enduring appeal of the Western - ""a man says he's going to do something, and he does it."" Here, the hero walks away and the audience stayed at home in droves.

It's not the only chance Mann takes - Alec Guinness' Marcus Aurelius tries to avert his impending death by bargaining with an invisible Ferryman, who speaks with his voice, while almost the entire first half of the film takes place on Rome's northern borders, bringing the empire to the emperor. His handling of the many setpieces is astonishing, from the funeral that Martin Scorsese rightly described as an epic eulogy for an entire style of epic filmmaking, to the astonishing coronation triumph where he gradually reveals the massive Forum Romanum set in a succession of increasingly impressive shots that show how much has been lost now that real sets and extras have been replaced by CGI. Equal kudos here to Colosanti and Moore's stunning design that creates a screen Rome unlike any before or since, not of whitewashed marble but of stone and wood and gold leaf and color, built for real in massive three-dimensional sets - the Forum was actually built full scale on the plains of Las Matas and filled with thousands of extras. But the spectacle isn't just gratuitous: you get a real sense of the sheer scale of the empire, and more importantly a sense of a world outside these characters that depends upon their actions. Throw in Dimitri Tiomkin's finest score, a world away from the standard Roman Empire 'sound,' and some impressive supporting performances (Guinness and James Mason's warm double-act a standout) that offset some of the weaker performances(step forward Sophia Loren in Yul Brynner-Westworld autopilot mode), and it adds up to a film well worth seeking out

On one level the Miriam Region 1 DVD is a good but sadly far from definitive release, with the Weinsteins releasing the three hour version but being too cheap to master from 65mm elements and not including the brief missing `trilemma' footage from the original roadshow version (although they claim the footage was located too late, in truth they thought it was too brief to be worth the mastering costs: but hey, the Weinsteins don't exactly have a reputation for putting footage BACK in pictures). As a result, some shots in the film look washed out and dupey, with some loss of detail: in fact, the picture quality often isn't as sharp as the German or French DVDs.

The extras package is good but shares the same half-heartedness - an incredibly badly mastered trailer is included but not the teaser (which was available to them), while the impressive original 1964 documentary Rome in Madrid is offered only with James Mason's narration (exhibitors had a choice of versions with Mason or Sophia Loren). Even the reproduction program in the 3-disc set is actually a trade sales brochure. On the plus side, the new featurettes are good, with the featurette on the film's historical accuracy thankfully not descending into the usual irate academics dismissing the film out of hand (though it's a shame composer John Scott, who has great stories of his time as a session musician on the score, wasn't interviewed for the Dimitri Tiomkin documentary) and the third disc on the deluxe edition includes the lavish Encyclopaedia Britannica documentaries on life in ancient Rome shot on the film's amazing sets. It's a great film and this is definitely the best DVD presentation thus far, but at the risk of sounding like sour grapes it's a shame they didn't make that little bit extra effort to get it perfect.

Since Amazon have combined all the reviews for different issues in one section, a word on the PAL releases. Sadly, unlike the 2.35:1 German and French DVDs, Universal's R2 UK PAL DVD is atrocious - a cropped 1.85:1 transfer from poor source material with faded colours and no extras save a trailer for Gladiator.",1197763200,,5351,4.774298056155508

It has a great cast, that's true (except for Boyd): Mason, Loren, Plummer (who is very good playing Commodus), and Guinness in a few scenes. But the drecting is very poor, the cutting of scenes awful with quiet and slow scenes jumping into action takes that happen quickly. These battle scenes have nothing to do with other great movies with war scenes, the best example still is Welles's ""Chimes at midnight"" (if we look for old movies).

The film can still be salvaged if one only attends to the historical aspects of it, or is a fan of period films with their costumes and traditions.

I can't say that it is totally bad. I watched it thru (and it's very long) twice in my life, and managed to do it by ignoring the ridiculous dialogues, specially in the love scenes, and simply admiring the grandiosity that the whole enterprise conveys.

Robert Krasker's cinematography especially filmed on the frozen frontier with the ominous forest in the background and snowflakes blustering across the screen are astonishingly atmospheric combined with one of Dimitri Tiomkin's most impressionistic, elegiac and enigmatic scores. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is lush and beautifully haunting throughout. The action sequences are impressively staged. The chariot chase on the frontier road and downhill through the pines between the stoic Stephen Boyd (Livius) and a very flamboyantly psychotic Christopher Plumber (Commodus) is a highlight. Most impressive are the outstanding and unbelievable sets by production designers Veniero Colasanti and John Moore.

Director Anthony Mann has a great ability to use outdoor landscapes to full advantage enhancing the drama. He contrasts the beauty of nature with unscrupulous men's desires to control their environment through manipulation and deceit against other men of greater moral fortitude. The tranquil outdoor settings are the stage for this conflict of good and evil.  Unsung and most forgotten is producer Samuel Bronston who gave us great epic films as this. He had a penchant for producing grand epics (EL CID and 55 DAYS AT PEKING) that were not only opulent and stirring but were elevated to higher cinematic and artistic prominence for their intellect and thought provoking scripting and images.",1143158400,,2014,5.532467532467533

1197826,4,B000009O12,"Another one of the more decent sword-and-sandal films to come out of the 1960s directed by Michael Mann (El Cid.)  The screenplay is quite good (""Gladiator"" is essentially the same screenplay) and the sets excellent but the casting and acting is somewhat uneven.  Nevertheless, the spectacular sets and costumes along with the top-knotch acting of the more seasoned actors more than makes up for the film's defects.

The story follows Livius (Stephen Boyd) who is loyal to Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guinness) and lover of Lucilla (the absolutely gorgeous Sophia Loren.) Commodus (Christopher Plummer) resents his father's affections for Livius as well as Lucilla's.  Jealous of Livius and fearing that he may take his right to the throne, Commodus seeks to destroy him.  Once upon the throne, Commodus becomes a corrupt ruler who takes pleasure in the arena but is fearful of the barbarian hordes coming into Italy.  The film also stars James Mason, Omar Sharif, and Eric Porter.

A major feast in this film apart from Sophia Loren who was in her prime was the historical faithfulness and the simply colossal scale of the production.  Filmed in Spain, the film left a legacy with a production on an epic scale.  They replicated a significant section of the Forum stone for stone as it was under Marcus Aurelius to exact specifications: it still stands there today!  One of the major draw backs to the film however is Stephen Boyd in the lead role; not only was he a mediocre actor, but his performance as Livius is no different than that of Massala's in Ben Hur; instead of turning bad, he just remains good.  I also couldn't stop thinking of Ben Hur when he was in the chariot race at the beginning of the film.  Christopher Plummer is outstanding as Commodus but a little too old for the part.  Alec Guiness certainly equals if not surpasses Richard Harris' performance in 'Gladiator.'  Although certainly more historically faithful than 'Gladiator' which is more a historical fantasy epic than drama, the film's plot cuts out 270 years of Roman hegemony to reach a climax of barbarian hordes ravaging through Italy and bringing the fall of Rome in 180 A.D. instead of 450 A.D.  In fact, the Roman empire was at its peak under the rule of Marcus Aurelius and not in decline or threatened with mass invasions as shown in the film.

If you liked 'Gladiator' and don't have a bias against older films, you will probably enjoy this film.  It has an outstanding production where no expense was too high.  The casting and acting is somewhat uneven but that is complemented by the great performances of several seasoned theatrical actors such as Alec Guiness and Christopher Plummer.  Although this film is not entirely accurate historically, it's certainly more so than 'Gladiator' or even 'Spartacus.'  A good movie to own.",1116979200,,2816,4.888421052631579
1197827,5,B000009O12,"From the lovely murals of the opening titles to the mano a mano combat in the finale, this film has my rapt attention for all of its 188 minutes, and is one of my favorite and most watched films; the stellar cast is superb, and the extraordinary recreation of the center of ancient Rome fantastic, especially for those of us who have walked through the ruins of the Capitoline Hill.
Filmed in Spain, Anthony Mann's direction is meticulous, Robert Krasker's cinematography breathtaking, and the Dimitri Tiomkin score enhances every scene.

The big name international cast:
Christopher Plummer is riveting as Commodus; he is unhinged and cruel, and yet with a certain devilish charm that makes his portrayal believable. His is the pivotal role in the film, and it is Plummer at his finest.
Stephen Boyd is excellent as Livius, the heroic element of the story, and his part is the antithesis of his Messala in Ben Hur, and in the wheel crushing chariot race in the first part of the film, he is the one driving the white horses.
James Mason can do no wrong in my eyes, and he is fabulous as Timonides the humanitarian philosopher.
Sophia Loren is gorgeous in a sensitive performance as Lucilla, Marcus Aurellius's daughter and Livius' love.
Other notable performances are from Alec Guiness as Marcus Aurelius, Anthony Qualye as Verulus, and Mel Ferrer as the blind and cunning Cleander. Omar Shariff has a small (pre-Dr. Zhivago) part as Sohamus the Armenian king.

Like an historical novel, there are elements that have been changed and shifted to be condensed into a film, but there is much here that is authentic; the battle scenes are spectacular, and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was one of the last films made to include the thousands of extras, and the vast sweep of epic story-telling, and was at the time the most expensive set (destroyed after filming so that other, smaller budget films would not use it) ever made.
Comparisons and similarities will endlessly be made to Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", and there is the coincidence that Richard Harris, who was originally slated to play Commodus, but left the cast after altercations with director Mann, was to play his father Marcus Aurelius in ""Gladiator"".
It astounds me that the only Oscar nomination this film received was Best Original Score, losing to ""Mary Poppins"", and in a musical sweep, most other awards going to ""My Fair Lady"".
The film ends with a quote from Will Durant: ""A great civilization is not conquered from without, until it has destroyed itself from within"".",1110067200,,2539,4.875
1197828,5,B000009O12,"This is a truly great & magnificent historical film epic noted mainly for its magnificent sets,costumes,cinematography & for being heavily criticized (especially in USA) for the performances of most of its actors & its overall sluggish plot. The film was an ENORMOUS FLOP in USA (Paramount's biggest flop of 1964 and one of their biggest flops ever) but a BIG SUCCESS in EUROPE (especially in U.K. as the Rank Organisation of Great Britain had a substantial financial investment in the movie) & in other parts of the world. It ruined its producer's (Samuel Bronston) Spanish film empire mainly due to the disastrous USA release (as expensive movie epics made in 1960's derived most of their profits in the USA market and most of Bronston's financial backers were from USA). This film has been dubbed the film that caused the fall of the roman epic (though the 1963 ""Cleopatra"" with Liz Taylor also has to wear some of the blame for this).

Trying to reproduce another huge ""Ben Hur""-style mega hit producer Samuel Bronston wanted Charlton Heston to re-team with Sophia Loren (as a year earlier EL CID had been a HUGE hit for him) but Heston, initially having agreed to do the film, eventually opted out even while the film's huge forum sets had just started construction (presumably because Heston DID NOT WANT TO MAKE ANOTHER Ben Hur. There's also the apparent fact that Sophia Loren & Charlton Heston privately HATED EACH OTHER whilst working on ""EL CID"" (it's also been suggested that Sophia Loren got paid MORE THAN HESTON for this film which obviously soured Heston's relationship with Loren in this film). Heston liked the plot of ""55 Days at Peking"" better & upon learning that Sophia Loren WOULD NOT BE HIS LEADING LADY in the Peking film quickly opted for ""55 Days at Peking"" over ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"". Bronston, ever so willing to accomodate ""EL CID/BEN HUR"" Heston as his favourite film star & also hopefully achieve the same blockbuster success as both ""BEN-HUR"" & ""EL CID"" had been with this new Peking film, immediately ordered the preliminary work for the forum set for ""Fall"" to be torn down and work to begin on the Peking city set for ""55 Days at Peking"" to replace it. Poor Charlton Heston was to learn all too quickly that Ava Gardner, who had been hired as his leading lady for ""55 Days at Peking"" was a lot more trouble (constantly drunk, arguing with everyone and always late for her scenes) than Sophia Loren had ever been. It got so bad that the producers decided to fire Ava Gardner half way through and kill off her character. Which is why Heston's character rides off into the sunset at the end of the movie with a chinese girl he has just adopted rather than his Ava Gardner love interest.

Lining up ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" as the next film after ""55 Days at Peking"" Bronston reportedly asked Kirk Douglas (of ""Spartacus"" fame) to do the Livius role for ""Fall"" after Heston's refusal (for $1.5 million USA being the equivalent of $7 million USA now according to Kirk Douglas in his book ""The Ragman's Son"" which was twice the amount Heston would have received for the role) whilst ""55 Days at Peking"" was still shooting. But he declined the role (apparently because he didn't like the script & the character of Livius and doing another Roman epic--apparently the same reasons as Heston had expressed). Even though Kirk Douglas had fired director Anthony Mann from directing his ""Spartacus"" film 3 years earlier Kirk Douglas and Anthony Mann were still friendly & Kirk Douglas later appeared in Mann's next film ""The Heroes of Telemark"" (1965) with Richard Harris (who coincidentally was fired from ""Fall"" by director Anthony Mann and later played emperor Marcus Aurelius in ""Gladiator""). So next choice for the role of Livius  was Stephen Boyd (again the Ben Hur influence as Boyd had played the villain Messala in Ben Hur) who was hired as the male lead actor (apparently because he fitted the costumes and had some experience in roman epics--Ben Hur & the original 1961 British based version of ""Cleopatra"" where he was cast as Marc Anthony opposite Liz Taylor's Cleopatra).

Why the obsession with ""Ben_Hur""? Well the 1959 production of ""Ben-Hur"" had cost $16 million USA and had grossed $145 million USA--an absolute mega hit (saving an almost bankrupt MGM at that time) and being the equivalent of earning at least $1.45 billion USA today (source: IMDB). Obviously for most producers following ""Ben-Hur""'s success this was the holy grail of achievement in historical epics.

The original plan was for Heston & Loren to each receive $750,000 for their roles (the same as in ""EL CID"" although there is a rumour that Sophia Loren actually was paid more than Charlton Heston on ""EL CID"" which would account for Heston's dislike of Loren on that film). But Stephen Boyd worked cheaper at $500,000 per film than Heston did at $750,000 per film. Thus Sophia Loren's salary suddenly increased from $750,000 to $1 million (Loren was the second actress after Liz Taylor in 1963's Cleopatra to get a $1 million fee) and she also got top billing over Boyd in this film (source: Sophia Loren autobiography). Stephen Boyd appears to be the loser here as Sophia Loren received twice as much as Stephen Boyd's fee. Which is the main reason she did the role as $USA 1 million in 1963 was the equivalent of approx. $USA 10 million now and she could brag that she was the SECOND ACTRESS (after Liz Taylor) TO BE PAID A MILLION DOLLAR FEE for a film. Boyd most probably took the lower salary & second billing to Sophia Loren as he'd scored a coup by managing to replace Charlton Heston as the lead male star in a roman epic instead of him doing another supporting character to Heston (like Messala in ""Ben-Hur""). Also Boyd's previous film (the MGM musical ""Jumbo"" with Doris Day) was a flop. Making another historical roman epic film like the recent, hugely successful ""Ben-Hur"" must have seemed like a good idea at the time. Also Bronston's recent 1961 ""King of Kings"" biblical epic for MGM (another roman-themed biblical epic & MGM's semi-sequel to ""Ben-Hur"") had been a reasonable box office success so there was every reason to believe in 1963, when ""FALL"" was filmed, that another roman epic that would be ""bigger than Ben-Hur"" would be extremely successful. Interestingly Stephen Boyd was originally cast as Marc Anthony opposite Liz Taylor's Cleopatra (with Peter Finch as Julius Caesar) in the first version of ""Cleopatra"" filmed in London in 1961 but this production was abandoned due to Liz Taylor's near terminal illness in 1961 (filming scenes of ""sunny Rome"" in a frigid British winter). So Boyd WAS HIGHLY REGARDED as a leading actor at the time.

Drawing heavily upon ""Ben-Hur"" meant a chariot race & Fall has an exciting one in a forest (with Boyd changing roles from ""Ben-Hur"" bad guy to the good guy charioteer this time). There's also the ""Ben-Hur"" boyhood friends becoming adult enemies plot influence and the thinly veiled suggestion that Livius and Commodus have had some sort of previous sexual activity between themselves as they drink from each other's wine skins with wine spurting into each other's mouth from the wine skins (as with Ben Hur & Messala drinking a welcome toast to each other from each other's wine cup). Christopher Plummer, in his autobiography, states that famous novelist & media personality Gore Vidal was a constant visitor to Fall's film sets in both Spain and ROME, Italy. YES, PART OF THIS FILM WAS FILMED IN ROME, ITALY (source: Cinecitta Studios website for 1963). Gore Vidal was the screenwriter for the first half of the 1959 ""Ben-Hur"" film and responsible for the hinted at, previously secret, gay relationship plot device between Ben Hur and Messala. Could he have whispered into the ears of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""'s screenwriters to include this previous homosexual relationship plot devise into ""Fall's"" script? (Gore Vidal himself was gay.) Continuing the ""Ben-Hur"" influence was the fact that ""Fall"" was filmed in the same 70mm format (MGM Camera 65/Ultra Panavision) as ""Ben Hur"". All of Bronston's other epics (apart from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"") were all filmed in 35mm Super Technirama and then blown up to 70mm---only ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was actually filmed in 70mm and strangely is only one of two Ultra Panavision films NOT EXHIBITED IN CINERAMA (""The Mutiny on the Bounty"" being the other one). As well, the stunts and action scenes were mostly directed by Yakima Canutt of ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race fame but Andrew Marton, also of ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race fame, was called in late in the production to direct the barbarians in the forest battle sequence near the film's beginning.

Alas, ""Fall"" was made 3 to 4 years too late (as historical epics were out of vogue in 1964 & thereafter until ""Gladiator"" in 2000) but had it been made a year after ""Ben-Hur"" and the same year as ""Spartacus"" (in 1960) it may well have succeeded. Some people claim that Liz Taylor's ""Cleopatra"" a year earlier in 1963 ruined the market for historical epics with its hugely overblown advertising campaign (absolutely necessary as Cleopatra's budget had doubled, then tripled, then quadrupled and is STILL THE MOST EXPENSIVE MOVIE EVER MADE after adjusting for inflation) plus its extremely long & tedious more than 4 hour running time ruining any appreciation of its more spectacular sequences. Thus ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" the following year (1964) was an obvious target (mainly by USA critics) for allegations of deja-vu & the familiar old style Roman epic plot criticisms (eg. huge cast of thousands in gigantic sets, another mad emperor, everybody spotlessly attired in the latest ancient roman fashions whilst living in seemingly newly-built houses and roaming around brand-spanking new temples & palaces with no hint of a ""lived-in"" look and stars fighting each other with not a hair out of place even in battle scenes). Movie audiences in 1963/64 were much more receptive to James Bond-type spy films, lavish musicals like ""My Fair Lady"" & ""Mary Poppins"" plus zany English pop groups like the Beatles nonsense style films (""A Hard Day's Night"") as well as english comedies (like ""The Pink Panther"" series with Peter Sellers) & english culture (""Tom Jones""). Also the so-called ""sexual revolution"" began about 1963 onwards. A total change of style in audience appreciation seemed to occur in 1963-1964.

However where ""Fall"" differs from ""Ben-Hur"" is in its secular (ie. non-religious) plot, its magnificent sets & costumes (outdoing any of its predecessors including ""Ben-Hur""--apart from the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race sequence which is still truly magnificent--the sets for ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" were all actual 3 dimensional buildings with roofs which allowed better & more intricate camera angles--not just facades or frontages with scaffolding at the back) and its extensive use of spectacular outdoor locations (much more so than ""Ben-Hur"") such as the forests/snow country sequences near the film's beginning & the desert battle of the 4 armies sequence in the middle of the film (this sequence used approximately 8,000 to 10,000 extras portraying the soldiers--most of them from General Franco's Spanish army). Integrating his characters into actual, very spectacular locations was one of the main features of director Anthony Mann's style.

""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" has an interesting plot for some viewers that's historically accurate to a point & then diverges into a Hollywood ""invent & destroy"" scripting technique just as ""Gladiator"" (and countless other Hollywood-style epics such as ""The Egyptian"") did. This is where fictional characters are interwoven with historical characters (to ""heighten"" the drama) & history is ""interpreted"" (i.e. distorted) but by film's end these fictional characters are either killed off or fade into the background so as not to disturb historical fact too much. No-one can absolutely say that people such as these fictional characters did not exist but also there is obviously no historical evidence to prove their existence. Thus fictional characters are invented (to heighten the drama) and then eventually removed or fade into the background. ""Fall""'s plot moves gracefully through its storyline (unlike  ""Gladiator""'s more rapid plot development) given that the era in which it was made (late 1950's to mid 1960's) called for an ""epic"" running time (3 hours plus) to match its epic size. This is probably why Gladiator is much more popular with younger audiences. Some people (usually younger viewers) think Fall far too slow & others (usually older viewers) appreciate the gradual pace of its story. Some people criticize the sudden action set pieces (eg. the chariot race) interrupting the intellectual aspects of the plot while others criticize the lack of enough action sequences and too much talk. As someone has said ""the curate's egg"", good in parts. In trying to please everybody the film-makers may have pleased far fewer viewers than expected.

Most if not all Hollywood made or financed epics are historically inaccurate & have many invented scenes as in the Kirk Douglas 1960 version of ""Spartacus"" where the last 30 minutes was a scriptwriter's invention (the real Spartacus is believed to have died during the final battle so there was probably no ""I am Spartacus"" defiance from his surviving troops or fight to the death/crucifixion outside the gates of Rome for Spartacus & Antoninus (played by Kirk Douglas & Tony Curtis respectively). Fall also has a few historical inaccuracies (as does Gladiator which seemed to borrow most of these historical inaccuracies from Fall's plot) of which the final duel to the death is the most blatant inaccuracy. However sometimes these scenes are so exciting and indeed moving one wishes that this is the way history should have been. Most people are still moved by the ""I am Spartacus"" defiance of  Spartacus's troops against the Romans and Spartacus dying on the cross---neither of which probably actually happened in reality.  Sometimes it is the feel & spirit of the era depicted that is more important than strict historical accuracy. These are extremely expensive films to produce so must appeal to a huge general audience to recoup their costs. Going for total historical accuracy over an exciting, interesting plot may only gain you an audience of history professors & their students rather than a huge, general audience. However GROSS breaches of historical accuracy or GROSS diversions from the source material (as the elimination of the gods in ""Troy"") are very annoying.

By the way the forum set in this film which was the biggest of several sets built for the film (the main Forum set was demolished soon after filming even though some remaining parts of other sets were used in ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" a year later in 1964---these remaining parts of other smaller sets were apparently muddied up to look lived-in for the latter film) still holds the record for the biggest ""purpose-built"" exterior film set. The forum set was not used for any other films (like ""AD"", ""Augustus"" or ""Rome"") and was demolished soon after filming. Apparently producer Samuel Bronston did not want any future, lesser production to use his magnificent forum set so he unwisely had it demolished. Imagine the revenue to be derived even today from such sets in a movie theme park. The sets for the city of Troy in 2004's ""Troy"" (which are bigger in area than ""FALL""'s forum set) embellished an existing 16th century fortress in Malta so were not ""purpose-built"" (i.e. built from scratch especially for the production).

A sadly underrated & magnificent achievement in historical film epics & everyone involved with the film should feel justly proud of their involvement with this film and the excellence of their achievement. This film is much more appreciated now than when it was first released.

Finally, where is the USA BlueRay version of this film, ""El Cid"" & ""55 Days at Peking""? ""King of Kings"" and, indeed, ""John Paul Jones"" (from a different distributor) is now available. They would be simply magnificent in either blueray or high definition disc versions. I am sure that tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of eager film fans (rather than just a few die-hard fans of either film) would buy such a high quality blueray disc.

POST SCRIPT: It's now 2013 and there are blue ray versions of this film (using the same Weinsten dvd version and exactly the same extras including specially made documentaries as in the Weinstein dvd version) available in Germany, France, Spain and Great Britain. ALL of these versions HAVE STILL OMITTED the ""Trilemma"" 90 second sequence which IS AVAILABLE to the Weinstein organization and could easily be inserted into the current version. The Weinstein organization have still not released a blue ray version of this film in USA. Maybe the idea of releasing special films in special releases under the name of their mother Miriam has not turned out exactly as expected but I think the Weinstein organization owes it to their loyal fan base (who actually pay money to buy these products and fully appreciate the Weinstein organisation making these films available again on disc) to at least release a version of this film with  THE  MISSING  ""Trilemma""  90 second sequence INCLUDED & hopefully a blue ray version. After all they've licensed their version of this film for blue ray release in Germany, France, Spain & Great Britain so its not as if the concept is unknown to them.

If they could also interview Sophia Loren, Christopher Plummer and Omar Sharif (the last surviving actors in this film--once they pass away it's a VITAL OPPORTUNITY MISSED) about their insights into this film that would be a huge bonus and an excellent selling point for a blue ray release (along with the ""Trilemma"" sequence).  Any other missing scenes could also be included as just a special section of ""missing scenes"" & would add enough extras to justify another purchase of this film in the blue ray format. I'm sure it would be very successful as the ""ultimate edition"". I'm also sure that if they did at least this much their mother Miriam would be truly proud of them. However if they've gone cold on the idea of releasing these films themselves maybe they could sell the rights to Criterion who've released an excellent ultimate version of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" or Time Warner who have made an absolutely excellent job of enhancing Bronston's ""King of Kings"" on blue ray disc into a film that looks like it was made this year (and not 50 years ago). The same holds true for Time-Warner's release of the ultimate edition of ""Ben Hur"" in blue ray with a frame by frame enhancement of the original film negative in it's original format and screen ratio (Camera 65/Ultra Panavision in 2.75:1 ratio and not 2.35:1). Again it looks like a new film and not one made 55 years ago.

EXTRA POST SCRIPT: It's now 2015 and still no sign of a blue ray version of ""Fall"" or ""El-Cid"" for the USA market. Also no sign of ""55 Days at Peking"" on either dvd or blue ray in USA apart from OK imported versions plus excellent UK & European blue ray versions. The Weinsteins seem to be doing what Disney did for nearly 10 years--just sit on these titles without ever releasing them. As stated earlier if they've got cold feet with their ""Miriam Collection"" dvd's and bluerays maybe they should consider selling their rights to Time/Warner who actually do release the films on dvd & blueray that they have the rights to. After all ""if it's too hot in the kitchen then get out of the kitchen""--according to President Eisenhower.",1085184000,,19706,4.93040072310937
1197829,3,B000009O12,"The screenwriter of ""Gladiator"" claims not to have seen ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" before writing the Ridley Scott film.  That's odd since both films are bookended exactly the same way. Both open with Emperor Marcus Aurelius deciding that his son Commodus should not be emperor (a decision that leads to his murder).  Both end with the fight between Commodus and the army  commander within the shields of the Pretorian Guards.  As a matter of fact, neither of these events are historically accurate.
Marcus Aurelius (according the Edward Gibbon and other historians) dealt the Empire a long-term blow when he broke with tradition by choosing his only surviving son, Commodus, to be his successor, rather than following the tradition of chosing the best man for the job and officially adopting him.  To the consternation of his legions, Aurelius never chose a military commander over his own son.  When you decide to abandon actual history at the very beginning of your story, the rest falls apart.
Secondly, Commodus was murdered by his concubine (who drugged his wine) and a wrestler (who strangled him) in his palace.  In fact, it took a few days for everyone in Rome to come to finally believe that he was actually dead.  HE WAS NOT KILLED in a single-handed combat with the commander of the army (either Stephen Boyd or Russell Crowe).
Third, there is no historical evidence that a group of barbarians were burned alive in the Roman forum, as this 1964 film depects.  The screenwriter seems to have simply lost his grip on any sort of reality and went totally ""Hollywood.""
Samuel Bronson (the producer) spared no expence to actually build an exact replica of the Roman Forum (rather than do it digitally as in ""Gladiator""), so the scenes shot on this set are truly spectacular.  The set (built in Spain) was said to have stood intact for some years, even after Samuel Bronson Productions went bacnkrupt (over this very film).  I have no idea if it's still standing.
Christopher Plummer is too old to play the actual Commodus, who was only a teenager when he ascended the throne.  However, the script actually does justice to the spirit of the historical character of Commodus, and Plummer brings the man to vibrant life.  Both Stephen Boyd (as the army commander) and Loren (as Commodus' sister) seem wooden and fail to establish any on- screen chemestry to their love-stared characters, although Loren's legendary beauty is well worth the price of admission.
Alec Guiness, James Mason, Anthony Quayle and Mel Ferrer all do an excellent job with their roles, although Omar Sharif has little to do since his scripted character is only one-dimensional.
Because of its over-all production values, and an appropriate and moving musical score, this becomes a satisfying, eye-popping, ""they don't make them like this anymore"" epic.  It must be seen in the Widescreen format to do it justice.",1084320000,,2893,4.938144329896907

Those who have carefully walked over the Roman Forum and Capitoline Hill will recognize many specific buldings, not just the great temples but also the commercial buildings around the Forum. In Ben Hur, by contrast, the set for the Roman Forum was mostly conjured out of thin air. It is unusual for Hollywood to construct sets that are reasonably true to history.",1057536000,,504,4.738636363636363
1197832,4,B000009O12,"Interest in this 1964 film from director Anthony Mann was revived by the Oscar winning success of ""Gladiator.""  Not only does ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" has some of the same characters, primarily the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodos, but there is also a Roman general who was a better son to the Emperor than his own flesh and blood.  There is even a gladiator fight; but there is also a chariot race and actor Stephen Boyd, so you might end up being reminded of ""Ben-Hur"" as well.  Judged by the standard of ""history,"" this is clearly the more accurate film, for what little that is worth by Hollywood standards.  After all, at the end of this three-hour film you find out that this is really just the BEGINNING of the Fall of the Roman Empire...
After two centuries of bloody rule by the Caesars, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Alec Guiness) wants to return the Roman Empire to the idealized state of the Republic.  But while the Emperor valued virtue, his son Commodus (Christopher Plummer) is a bad seed.  Consequently, the Aurelius takes the unprecedented step of naming his successor to be the General Livius (Stephen Boyd), commander of the Northern legions, who agrees with the Emperor's vision for the future of the Empire.  Commodus makes this all moot by having a slave (Mel Ferrer) murder the Emperor.  Once he is in charge, Commodus exiles Livius to the frontiers of Germania and sells off his own sister, the woman the general loves, Lucilla (Sophia Loren), to the King of Armenia (Omar Sharif) to cement an alliance (and, one suspects, to add insult to injury for Livius).
Despite all the relationship issues ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" consistently goes with spectacle over story during its three hour run.  Guiness has the best performance in the film and he gets killed off early on.  Boyd is not a dynamic enough actor to make the part of Livius more interesting, but his nature reticence works for his character, at least in the first half of the film.  Loren is given very little but to stand that and look lovely and emotionally distraught over the latest turn of affairs.  James Mason has a couple of really nice speeches to deliver as Timonides, the advisor to Auerlius.  Plummer provides a really edgy performances as the mentally unstable Commodus; the question is simply whether you think he goes over the top or not.
However, whatever limitations of the story or uneven performances by the principles, the production design and action pieces are well above average.  Certainly worth one look for fans of Roman Empire films, but it is not likely to become a favorite.  There are those who think this film holds the record for most extras in a movie and while that might have been true at the time ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" was made, Sir Richard Attenborough had 3,000,000 extras for the funeral scene in ""Gandhi"" in 1980.  I have no clue what computer generated film now holds the record, but for the sake of argument we will assume it is ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" until the final film in the Trilogy comes out.  Oh, and if you want a final link between this film and ""Gladiator,"" actor Richard Harris, who played Marcus Aurelius in that film was originally signed to play Commodos in this one.  I wonder why they did not ask Christopher Plummer?",1051574400,,3309,4.666092943201377

1197835,4,B000009O12,"I have to agree with most of Toshif's DVD review (March 27, 2001) of THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.  In terms of the script, acting, and the historical accuracy, it clearly is a better film than GLADIATOR.  The latter film clearly borrowed copiously from THE FALL, why was this not acknowledged?  Alec Guiness is wonderfully cast as emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.  His performance is far better than the rather weak performance of Richard Harris in the same role in GLADIATOR.  I would like to touch on another film that seems to owe something to THE FALL.  My young son, on seeing Marcus Aurelius making his first appearance exclaimed, ""That's Obi-Wan Kenobi!""  It is true, even down to the costuming and beard, the resemblance of the two characters played by Alec Guiness is startling.  We then looked up the biography of Marcus Aurelius in the World Book Encyclopedia and were informed that the Stoic emperor believed that all mankind was bound together by a ""universal force.""  This cannot possibly be entirely coincidental!  Is Guiness' Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight, in the STAR WARS epics a reprise of his portrayal of Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher emperor of Rome?",1006041600,,1176,4.954081632653061

Stephen Boyd and Sofia Loren are pleasant to look at, but beneath that surface there's not much there. Boyd was an interesting overlooked actor, type-cast after his turn in Ben-Hur,it would have been interesting to have seen him as Antony in ""Cleopatra"". Alec Guiness and James Mason were outstanding and Christopher Plummer delightfully chews the oppulant scenery as the mad/bad emperor Commodus. The lavish sets and crowds were truly awe inspired. Unlike the computor generated effects of Gladiator, they actually built the sets and populated them with real people.",999907200,,691,5.281818181818182
1197837,5,B000009O12,"I first saw THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE  in 1964, when it was released for movie theaters. I saw it in Toronto, 4 times,  4 evenings in a row. I was simply appalled by the actorship of some of the greatest to have been seen obn a screen. The story itself respected a great deal what the historians related about the last says of emperor Marcus Aurelius, and the tragic taking-up of power by his mad son, Marcus Aurelius Commodus. Not to mention the grandiose musical score by one of the greatest, Dimitri Tiomkin ( I still have the vinyl LP, and play it regularly, when I want to get in the mood of ancient Rome ).
Yesterday, I viewed "" GLADIATOR "". It certainly did ring a bell. Although I enjoyed the Ridley Scott epic, as well as the fine play of actors such as Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, I am sorry to say this most modern production has to be rated quite a few steps below its 1964 predecessor.

1197841,5,B000009O12,"Martin Scorsese once said about THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE that it has the beauty of a lost art. True, Hollywood can never film a film of this grandiose scale (nowadays CGI would replace those hundred of extras, but CGI can never be as good as the real thing)  that deals with profound themes, usually considered to be ""commercially unnatractive"". Still, if cinema is an art form (and the Oscar people pretentiously call themselves Academy of Motion Picture ""ART"" and Science), then they should sometime try to make a film like that, or at least honour them when they are made, instead of praizing such well-crafted nonsense like GLADIATOR. Hollywood has forgotten its rich history and heritage.  What a shame.
THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE is an intense, powerful drama about corruption of power.  Anthony Mann's meticulous, sharp-edged, and in this case extremely cold-blooded direction powerfully points out how the Roman Empire, at the height of its power and glory, started its degradation and eventually will fall apart. That might happen to any kind of powerful society --history has proven so-- , that when a society gets too much power, the power itself becomes the motivation for corruption and destruction. This film is not a shalow fascistic glorification of power that GLADIATOR is, but an inteligent, profound and ultimately tragic analysis of human behavior.
Not to say that it is not visually atractive. Mann was always a creator of powerful, eloquent imagery. Simply, he doesn't waiste pictorial beauty as Ridley Scott did in GLADIATOR (or even more in HANNIBAl, for that matters). He is one of those great masters who knows how to amplify a good story with powerful imagery, to show the story even more than telling it with dialogues. So instead of filling a whole picture with post-card-like images, he punctuates strong dramatic monent withe powerful shots--no waste.
 The film was shot in Ultra Panavision 70, which is an VisitaVision camera with an anamorphic lens attached to it. It was probably the most versitile system among those large format (65mm) system of the 60's. With amazing image clarity, yet one could move the camera almost as freely as in regular 35mm. When somebody like Anthony MANN was gievn such a camera, the result is astonishing (another, arguably better example is EL CID).
The irony is that, to portray the corruption of power, one has to show the power itself--in this case a huge number of extras dressed as roman soldiers, The film was hot in spain, and all those extras was furnished by general Franco's fascistic military regime. Franco loved movies, but apparently never realised that the film he helped making was a critical metaphore of what he was, the ""ideology"" that he stood (or he pretended he did) for.
A flawed film, perhaps, but a striking, beautiful piece of filmmaking.",985651200,,2836,4.96421052631579

1197845,4,B000009O12,"The title of this film is a bit of a misnomer; the Roman Empire didn't fall for about another three hundred years after the events depicted in this film took place.  However, after the reign of the emperor Commodus (portrayed in this flick by Christopher Plummer), the empire never was quite as powerful as it had been while the Aurelian emperors ruled.  A familiarity with Roman history would be very helpful to understand the events depicted in this movie.  Fans of ""Ben Hur"" might find it a little difficult to accept Stephen Boyd in his role of ""good guy"" Livius.  Overall, if you like historical films with big budget backdrops and pretentious action scenes, you won't be disappointed.

The cinematography is just splendid and dramatically progresses the story  (after all, film is a visual medium). The action sequences are remarkably  moving and impressively staged.

1197847,4,B000009O12,"After watching the excellent ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" it is perfectly clear where ""Gladiator"" stole many of its ideas and themes. The great director, Anthony Mann, who made this movie following the  immense ""El Cid,"" again works on a vast canvas and what scenes he  conjures up! ""Gladiator"" tries to do this with new digital  technology and with lesssor results. Alec Guiness is wonderfully cast as  the philosopher-emperor, Marcus Aurelius, and when he's on the screen,  ancient historical thought comes alive. Stephen Boyd is fine but just more  of a gentle Roman general than his wonderfully evil Messala in  ""Ben-Hur."" Sophia Loren is luminous but for some reason her  director(Anthony Mann) gets her to sleep-walk through two epics in a row  and have unconvincing tears gather at her tear ducts. Mann knows how to  handle great armies and this film is full of wonderfully imagined battles,  marches into cities, and pomp and violence. It is a long movie with some  slow spots, especially when Guiness dies, but Christopher Plummer as  Commodus completely makes me forget Joaquin Phoenix in  ""Gladiator,"" for Plummer is a great actor who gives Commodus so  many facets and watch his relationship with Boyd and their final fight to  the finish and you'll see where the seeds of the ending to  ""Gladiator"" were sown. Are all Germans blonde? In this movie they  are all blonde and rather ridiculously portrayed, as if the director was  looking for a certain ""barbarian"" look. If they were that stupid  and unsavory, how did they fight to bring down an empire? We get some ideas  here how Rome changed. James Mason plays a pupil of Marcus Aurelius and he  also is a great actor and his torture scene is strangely moving. Dimitri  Tiomkin's music score blares and blares and is good but not up to the  standards of say an Alex North or Miklos Rozsa, both masters at bringing  history alive through music. There seems like so much potential for a great  film here but it is a hit or miss film with some great acting, great  photography, sets, and feel for its time, when many forces were swirling  about to bring down the Roman Empire from within and from unknown  machinations. It is well worth buying and to adding to anyone's video  collection, who relish ancient history well told on the screen.",962496000,,2300,4.793367346938775

The climatic duel is untrue and ridiculous, but overall this film intelligently captures the complexity of Roman history of this transitional  period.
Alec Guiness is magnificent as a thoroughly convincing Marcus  Aurelius. The wisdom, compassion and humanity of this stoic emperor comes  back to life. James Mason's progress from  philosopher to Christian is very  subtle and understated; far more convincing than the pious faithful in your  average 1960's Roman epic.
Gladiator is entertaining and packed with  detail, but it's politics are naive in the extreme, and the portrayal of  Marcus Aurelius is largely inaccurate - particulary his death.
