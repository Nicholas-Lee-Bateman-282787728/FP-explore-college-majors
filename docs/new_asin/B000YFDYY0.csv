ART IS AN ATTITUDE:  The Art of Drawing the Figure
Essential Exercises by Bill Buchman
[...]
For beginning artists or advanced or professional.
Color/DVD.  Zone-free format: NTSC.  90 min.  Nude art model.

Traditionally, art instruction separates technique from creativity. In this excellent art-instruction DVD, Bill Buchman innovatively uses technique to open up your creativity, to let bloom the soul and expressiveness of your figure art!

Mr Buchman's openminded, lighthearted artistic style is about fluidity and flow, free-spirited boldness blended with joy and fun, the pure poetic *art* of a picture appearing from the simple essence of revealing form from what you see.  With an almost-zen-oriental philosophy that focuses on the process not the result, Mr Buchman shows you how to use mass, line, contour, direction, and expressive gesture to keep your art loose and free all the time, to let the line, the ink, the paint, have a life of its own.  ""To draw is to risk,"" Mr Buchman reassures us.

Start and stay with the fundamentals, he says, and keep things simple:  ""All drawing is simplification.""  See the big shapes, the ones that really count, and let the line and values have a life of their own and the sense of the drawing will appear, almost as if by magic.  Trust in yourself.  Trust in exercises as educational investment.  Be confident and patient with yourself; have faith that pure art will emerge from what you do.

Much like the DVD's light jazz background music, Mr Buchman is a friendly, pleasant, encouraging teacher, rather gentle and affirming in his approach.  He explains things clearly and thoroughly.  As for qualifications, Mr Buchman has been an artist and teacher for many years, since he studied life drawing in the 1960s with impressive art mentors, including Victor D'Amico, education director of the Museum of Modern Art.

This DVD feels full:  90 minutes of one art technique and exercise after another, in the form of a private lesson in Mr Buchman's studio.  You get to look over Mr Buchman's shoulder as he demonstrates twenty-five fundamental figure-art techniques -- including his own invention, the delightful continuous-contour drawing technique he calls ""Loop De Loop"" -- and simultaneously reveals his methods for developing proficiency with conte crayon, gel pen, ink wash, sumi brush, pastels, acrylic ink, watercolor crayons, and even a reed pen (as Van Gogh used).  And you can use the DVD's menu to re-watch particular lessons as you like.

I personally love realistic, representational art more than any other, but Bill Buchman's abstract impressionist art -- especially when he uses color -- is lovely and full of life, in a way even the finest realistic art could never be.  I 've collected a hundred books and videos that show me how to draw more realistically, and I treasure each one.  But I was delighted to watch this DVD and feel an uplifting permission to be much more free in creating my art and still trust that it will be all right -- that what I create will truly be art, maybe even more so than what I've been creating for years, so carefully and so cautiously.

Mr Buchman's art is not based on realism.  This DVD will not teach you to more realistically draw the human face, the hands and feet (in fact, Mr Buchman favors the torso and persuasively argues that trying to render too much detail in face, hands, and feet can ruin a work faster than anything.)  This DVD will help you open up your art and make it more creative and fluid and wonderful and enjoyable.
I heartily recommend it, for artists of all levels.

8232538,4,B000YFDYY0,I really like watching the artist use so many different techniques.  It's also very interesting to see his finished work side-by-side with the model he is working from.  A very interpretive and skilled artist.  Good model too.,1460851200,,226,5.054054054054054
8232539,4,B000YFDYY0,I love it. Figure drawing is always challenge for most of artist but Bill has made it so easy in his DVD. Very artistic and poetic presentation with easy to follow and step by step instruction made so easy to draw and paint figure.,1391990400,,231,4.2727272727272725
8232540,5,B000YFDYY0,"Bill's technique's are right down my alley! Working fast and loose gives your art energy and a liveliness that cannot be achieved otherwise. The DVD is very professionally done; the only thing that could make it better would be a split screen where you could see the model as Bill draws. As it is, to work from the model, you have to stop the DVD. I still gave it Five stars for all the great exercises and information provided.",1371945600,,428,4.430379746835443
8232541,5,B000YFDYY0,"I am not that easy to please as a customer. I've given a series of 1 star ratings lately (see my other reviews).
I'm very happy to offer a 5 star rating now, and I would  offer a 6 star rating it that existed.

There is an enormous abundance of books that aim to teach you how  to draw ""realistic"".
Often this means creating more of the same, dead boring drawings that all look more or less the same, futile attempts to create a ""photo"" by hand. It is like going out to dinner, to an Italian restaurant, and ordering a spaghetti Bolognese; you know up front, completely sure, that you will not be disappointed, but at the same time you will never be surprised. If you can not tolerate any ambiguity, if you want a futile result now, if you don't want to look further then your nose is long, and your most important priority is that you are completely sure that will not surprise yourself with outcomes you didn't anticipate, and your primary aim is to simply copy, and make another dead boring near photograph, ""art"" of the living dead; zombies, if the greatest pleasure in your life, you can think of, is eating spaghetti Bolognese on Saturday evening for the next fifty years of your life, then Bill Buchman may not be for you.

There are very, very little books/DVD's on the creative/expressive part of art/drawing; Bill Buchman is a rare exception. I graduated in college (not an art college, but psychology and learning processes), Master's Degree, with a professor in creativity, so I know a bit in this area. The bulk of art teachers are completely! ignorant of, and only have baloney to say, about creativity. What Bill Buchman says makes sense, compared to his colleagues art teachers, Bill Buchman is the maestro in creativity. I will not bore you with reviewing the contents of the book, dvd.

Creativity/self-expression is not for everyone. Some reviewers say that they do not particularly like the materials, or the drawings of Bill Buchman, and of course that is also a matter of personal taste; that's fine.
But, in my view, obviously it is not the intention to simply copy Bill Buchman (there is nothing creative, expressive or authentic about that) but to use his valuable suggestions as openings to your own creative, artistic, expressive process, materials and outcomes. The creative and expressive process in itself can give enormous! joy (have a go!), independent of the outcome at that specific point in time, there is always a new opportunity (have a new go!).

I first looked at Bill Buchman's video and then, having got curious, read his book, in one weekend, it was a joy.
I think you will appreciate the book a lot more if you start with the video, and first sea, hear, experience Bill Buchman in action, the joy and a lot more than that. After this the book still is very worthwhile studying.

Some extreme, complete, utter beginners ""complain"" that Bill Buchman only shows drawings of female models.
I can see no other option then to forgive their ignorance from our heart, and to pray for these apparently completely ignorant, simple souls; may the lord be with them; praise the lord.

Bill Buchman is, next to an artist, also a Jazz musician. I, alas, don't know anything, really nothing at all, about music, I simply like it; it is in my veins; just intuition and incredible joy. For me the following ""Jazzy"" music, at a little higher upbeat, energy, and joy, reflecting my own enormous joy and energy, available e.g. on YouTube, was a great mood companion while reading the book, and while making my own creative drawings: Shakatak - Dark is The Night [Extended Remix], http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yff58NaVZl8
Check it out, it is timeless. Do you like experimenting with a simple form? Do you like making something great even a lot better? if you like creativity and joy, flow, grace, rhythm, etc., you will love this; wow, boy these people enjoy making creative, enjoyable music, based on a simple theme, pffff !, this is music you love ! There is nothing more inspiring, then being inspired, and loving it. The start of any creative process is you loving it, you know love, love!,  and then the highly enjoyable outcomes will follow!",1370908800,,4171,4.75
8232542,5,B000YFDYY0,This is an excellent dvd for beginner life drawers.  He demonstrates a variety of ways of expressing the human form.,1356566400,,116,4.8
8232543,5,B000YFDYY0,"Whether or not you like this DVD will mostly depend on whether you like Bill Buchman's work. If you like his work, you'll love this disk.

It's impossible to fault the way the program's been put together. You can watch it right through, or the well-designed menu system also allows you to instantly jump to any section or any one of the 25 exercises on the disk. Mr Buchman himself comes across as a very nice guy and a great teacher.

I used the DVD as a tutorial, working 'along with' Buchman for a few exercises each day. The first time I did this (and in the first 'edition' of this review) I was less than complimentary about the results. Now, looking back (after about a year and a half), I can see how beneficial the process actually was. It gave me several new ways to use materials, and almost subliminally changed my way of 'seeing'.

The DVD cover art gives a good idea of Bill Buchman's style. If you like it, or want to give it a shot, then this DVD is probably a must-buy.

But even if you prefer your work to look a little less abstract, this is an excellent compendium of ideas for quick gesture drawings to loosen up before you begin your 'real' work (most of the exercises do work well for this, and even if you prefer a more representational style these exercises can't help but make you look harder at the figure, or to see it in a new way - which has to be a good thing, right?)

Each exercise ends with a comparison shot of the model alongside the finished work. There are also frequent shots of the model in a selection of quite wonderful poses which means that, if you don't mind working from a video image, you could even use them for your own style of drawing.

Anyway, you might like to check his website (figuredrawing.org) before you buy - You'll find a few clips from this DVD there, and illustrations of his more finished pictures.",1354924800,8,1862,4.351585014409222
8232544,5,B000YFDYY0,"I enjoyed  his varied interpretations of the model and her poses. He used a variety of media that was very useful for me, a new artist. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially those artists who draw or paint the same, work after work.",1338163200,4,243,4.5227272727272725
8232545,5,B000YFDYY0,I enjoyed watching this video and now feel less intimidated by the process of Figure Drawing. I also purchased Buchman's book to go along with the video from Amazon and it has much more detail on the process.  Look forward to actually practicing his techniques.  Most helpful lesson - don't worry about the faces and hands to start or you'll get stuck and frustrated.,1337040000,6,367,4.71875
8232546,5,B000YFDYY0,"Bill Buchman has done such a wonderful job in this DVD really showing you how to 'see' (perceive) the human figure.  I found the instruction to be a journey into personal transformation with the beautiful music, poetry and Mr. Buchman's wonderful sense of presence and instruction. This DVD offers a myriad of individual drawing techniques with a live nude model, discusses different media thoroughly and above everything else is inspiring and empowering.  As a side note, I have had a question or two about materials and emailed him personally and within a few hours had such a warm, welcoming response. On another side note :) he's got another DVD called Creative Breakout where he delves into more abstraction.  This instruction too is a MUST have!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creative-Breakout-The-Art-of-Freedom-Interactive-DVD/dp/B001JYT2Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creative Breakout, The Art of Freedom [Interactive DVD</a>]

8232547,4,B000YFDYY0,"This is a good DVD to own.

The main reason to pick this DVD up is to see the many different medias that are used. He demonstrates the techniques clearly rather than just giving you some vague lecture about gesture and form, which it also covers, ha! The downside is that the advice given is pretty basic so this would be a great purchase for someone who is just starting out or needs some direction.

If you're starting out or you want to experiment with different medias you should definitely pick this up but if you are a already seasoned artist you should probably just borrow from a friend.",1290297600,11,595,4.4495412844036695
