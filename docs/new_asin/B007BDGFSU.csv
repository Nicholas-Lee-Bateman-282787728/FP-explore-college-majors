I am sooooooooo disappointed!! it is like i paid for nothing woth??
I was not able to listen to the instructions not see the videos clearly!
this product is really an AWFUL!
I need either my money back or send me another WORKING DVDs!
It is like there is no honesty in selling these DVDs,
That is all.",1373155200,2,631,4.401709401709402
