3682820,4,B001LBNI06,"Very nice. I wish it had other music besides Christmas, but I just play a disc while the ""fire"" is crackling. Can't beat the price!",1369872000,,131,4.28
3682821,5,B001LBNI06,I got this because a friend of mine had one.  It is very realistic and makes one feel warm just looking at it.,1364428800,,110,3.782608695652174
3682822,5,B001LBNI06,Now I have a fireplace where my big screen is. Its great. Can't wait until I get company over to see it.,1362441600,,104,3.772727272727273
3682823,3,B001LBNI06,"The DVD is ok, I was somewhat disappointed that it did not cover the entire tv screen as I have A 42"" tv. The sound and picture are ok.",1357862400,,135,3.689655172413793

3682825,5,B001LBNI06,"Well, I can see that there are others available,  but this one really is nice to have when you don't have a fireplace and want the ambience.  Really works to create the atamosphere of a fireplace for holiday spirit.  Sounds perfect too.  I have ordered 2 more for gifts - I am sure the large screen owners would love to have this rather than some noise of a show nobody wants to watch during a gathering..
As I said,  there are others,  but this one is Perfect...",1356134400,3,463,4.264367816091954
3682826,4,B001LBNI06,"The video was much better than I expected and I use it all the time.  The only thing is that at the end, the picture hangts up at the end for several minutes and then starts over again.  Not sure if that was intentional.  Otherwise its great...",1355702400,,244,4.148936170212766
3682827,5,B001LBNI06,I use this when I want a warm atsmophere in the room.  I love the sound and the fact you can chose the music you want. My favorite is at Christmas time. It is very realistic. You can feel the heat. You also can let it burn with no sound but natural crackles.,1318204800,6,258,3.8679245283018866
3682828,5,B001LBNI06,"This DVD is great.  You might think the concept is ""hokey"" but it is not.  The music and the firesounds and video are great!  YOu really do forget it is a TV screen and a DVD.  It is cheap cost wise as well.  This DVD is well worth the small amout they ask.  I highly recommend it!",1294012800,,281,3.8421052631578947

3682835,5,B001LBNI06,"We had a No Burn day in Phoenix, Arizona on Christmas Eve.  We had our roaring fire and beautiful music playing during our family Christmas Eve party.  Everyone loved it and wanted to know where they could get one.  Great gift.",1389312000,,227,4.487804878048781
3682836,2,B001LBNI06,"I very much like the DVD. There are different fire selections as well as the ability to play the fire and holiday music in any combination. (Crackle and music, just music, just crackle). However there is a camera icon that is constantly in the top corner of the screen when you play the DVD, really ruins the ambiance. :(",1389312000,2,321,4.4576271186440675

8317786,5,B001LBNI06,"People sat around the fireplace for more than just warmth, fire is almost hypnotic. Fire is beautiful and relaxing - it's elemental.  Sadly most people don't have fire places anymore. With a descent sized TV, this DVD is a close 2nd to the real thing.

Viewing options include moderate flames, flickering flames, roaring flames, or roaring flames burning down to flickering.  The last is my favorite.  Watching the flames consume the logs and slowly die down to coals.  Audio options are Sounds of  Fire , Holiday Music, or Fire Sounds with Holiday Music.",1459468800,,555,4.913978494623656

8317791,4,B001LBNI06,I really enjoy this DVD.  I don't have a fireplace and was looking for something to put on so the house is not so quiet.  The music is very relaxing Christmas music.  I only wish it had other music options.,1449532800,,206,4.1
8317792,5,B001LBNI06,Good Christmas ambiance.  Even makes the room seem warmer.,1434585600,,58,5.444444444444445
