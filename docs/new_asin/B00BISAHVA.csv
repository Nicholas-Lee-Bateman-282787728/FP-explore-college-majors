5624207,5,B00BISAHVA,"I like to use the Maui Heart Health video with just the background sounds, watching and listening for the pop ups for changing heart rate. The scenery makes this relatively easy endurance ride fun for being on a trainer. The double peaks of effort with cool down are just right for a recovery ride. I recommend the Blu-Ray for the crisper image. For fun, I tried both the DVD and Blu-Ray.",1365206400,,388,4.47887323943662
5624208,5,B00BISAHVA,The entire Heart Health series from CVO is fantastic.  They make for great recovery rides or for those just starting out on the trainers.  Paul definitely makes the BEST cycling videos on the market!,1365120000,,199,4.823529411764706
5624209,5,B00BISAHVA,The purpose of the Heart Health series is to help you relax. There's no dashboard or any other graphic to watch to make sure you're going hard enough. It's steady purposeful riding. But don't let the no dashboard fool you. It's a great workout. The scenery in Maui is incredible. This is one not to be missed.,1365120000,,309,4.43859649122807

8569118,5,B00BISAHVA,"This is an excellent recovery ride video, and should appeal to a variety of riders who are looking for a less demanding, fast paced ride. The scenery is ever changing. You move from bright sunlight into cloud cover, around dark bends and back into sunshine throughout the majority of the ride. It is a nice descent to the town, as the ride moves from the ""aloneness "" of a mountain road to the busy streets. As others have pointed out, the first 10 minutes or so are a little bumpy, as apparently the road is not in very good condition  If that bothers you, do as I do and start at the 10 minute mark. It is still a nice long ride from that point.
In addition I like the flexibility to move from the discussion audio track to the music only track to the ""sounds of the ride"" track...something for everyone.",1516492800,,806,4.302631578947368
8569119,5,B00BISAHVA,Awesome video and keeps you motivated to see more.,1420502400,,50,4.666666666666667
8569120,5,B00BISAHVA,"I love the Cycling Video Online series. Paul gets it right. This particular one is a little too easy for me, but great for a beginner or someone who trains harder but needs an active rest day. This is the hardest type of day for me but I know it's important to have active recovery days, and this will force you to do that.",1410825600,,323,4.0625
8569121,5,B00BISAHVA,"I just finished 1:22 minutes of the Heart Health The Valley Isle Roads of Maui. I completed it on my elliptical and on a recumbant Precor. The results were good for my purposes. There are options. You can have no sound at all, of course, all music, conversation, or just sounds of the ride. This time I chose all of the above. The conversation is motivating just because I feel like someone else is there with me. I also know that I'm not in an endless loop if I get really tired, because I know I haven't heard that part of the discussion before. I liked Marissa. She sounds like someone I would enjoy taking a bike ride with. She's a teacher from Barcelona, Spain, and specializes in fitness, dance, etc. The scenery includes long roads with an occasional view of the ocean. Lots of roads curve up and down mountains, or I guess it is a volcano. We went through a couple of towns. Nothing spectacular there. We end up on a small bike path to the beach. Nice. I felt like jumping in at that point. I have many of these videos and love them. My budget isn't going to allow me to buy every one of them, so I'm going to start going back through others that I've bought over the years. I've never been disappointed in any of them. These are great motivating tools that encourage me to go upstairs to my gym and enjoy another part of the country, or another season of the year. I recommend them.",1383955200,,1391,4.2927756653992395
8569122,4,B00BISAHVA,This is meant to be a recovery ride so it's an easy dvd though long.  It gives you the option to do different setups or no audio which I like.  I only gave it 4 stars because the surroundings I found a bit boring.  Still a very good dvd and I will use it again.,1375920000,,261,3.709090909090909
8569123,2,B00BISAHVA,The narrative is very boring and doesn't add anything to the video itself.  The ride is not even mildly challenging and pretty much continues at the same pace throughout.  I own other Paul Gallas DVD's which are much more informative and challenging.  Pass this one and buy the heart health DVD going through Colorado.  At least  you will feel both mentally and physically stimulated.,1369785600,,384,4.9375
8569124,1,B00BISAHVA,"I own the ALASKA of this series do not use it or like it.  I tried one more to be fair to the company and the technique.

Don't waste your money.

Here are my concerns:

1. Medium workout at best.  Not for the hard core Spinner.  No standing or running on the bike.

2. It is REAL TIME bike ride.  This includes (gulp!) nearly hitting someone, riding the wrong way down a street, and not stopping at STOP signs.  What, no EDIT button?

3. Yes, you can shut off the banter of two people, thank goodness. 1 hour and 55 minutes of yakking about food, fitness, and happiness.  Yes, I agree that portions are too big and school lunches are terrible.  I could barely listen to it even ONCE.

4. First few minutes totally choppy, going over a bumpy road.  Again, no EDIT button?

5. Scenery OK, I expected more spectaular in Hawaii.

For the best of the best, check out vafitness.com cycle series.  These guys have figured it out, with breathtaking scenery and a literal breath taking killer ride.",1367280000,,990,4.411111111111111
8569125,4,B00BISAHVA,"Honestly, I was disappointed when I tried this video because it is not as challenging. However, I realized that this is the purpose of the heart health videos. However, the difficulty level is on the back cover so I decided that I didn't care because it is a ride in Maui. How much better can that get. My husband and I went to Maui for our honeymoon (before i started riding). We loved it. It is a shame that the skies aren't clear but that is the nature of real riding. Would I buy it again if I had to????? Yes I would because it gives me an opportunity to take a virtual ride back to Maui. In addition, I have realized that not every ride should be a ball-busting workout like Paul calls it:)
Sincerely,
Lori",1367193600,,712,4.204379562043796
8569126,5,B00BISAHVA,"The Blu-Ray is fantastic. Thanks for putting out another HH series. The lack of heads up display makes these perfect for recovery rides. Especially if you are the type of person who pushes themselves. Also, great scenery and real llife ride including distracted drivers and near misses!!! Commentary not as good as other videos but still entertaining. Makes the workout not boring...like riding in a group ride. Thanks for another great vid!",1365552000,,441,5.138888888888889
8569127,5,B00BISAHVA,"As an aspiring Ironman Triathlete, Hawaii simbolizes the ultimate dream and goal. I had been looking for a virtual ride that would allow me to ""ride"" those Hawaiian roads, and this one does exactly that. The duration of this ride is perfect for an indoor session: not too short, but not too long either.",1365379200,,303,4.62962962962963
