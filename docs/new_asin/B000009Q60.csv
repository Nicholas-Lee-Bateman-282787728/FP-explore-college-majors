Cause this is my favortie movie in the whole wide world.  I loved all the fights scenes, the martial arts is awesome.  And of course, for the ladies, there is always a love story intertwined in the plot.  I could lie and say that everybody would love this movie, kids and adults, people of all ages, but i'm not goin' to.  I love this movie cause I'm a huge martial arts fan, and you have to be too, to be able to appreciate this film.  Well, I hope you get this movie and enjoy it as much as I did, do, and will.",996019200,,650,4.03125

Great fight scenes (not surprising, with Sammo in charge), heroic good guys, viscious bad guys, the equisite Rosamund Kwan as the once and future uber-babe, and the mountain like presence of Ti Lung, one of Hong Kong's dramatic greats.  While the plot is a basic formula, and the characters are a little one dimentional, it still acts as a reminder of what heroism is all about. Sammo shows his old school roots with this film, along with his usual ability to put together, without exception, the best fight scenes ever put on film.  With a talented cast that breathes life into the characters and a story that draws the viewer in, this film is quintisential Hong Kong Cinema.  Hey, it even made my girlfriend cry, and she HATES martial arts movies! 'nuff said.",990662400,,908,4.6918238993710695
