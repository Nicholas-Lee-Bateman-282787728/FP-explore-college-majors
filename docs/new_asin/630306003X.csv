543995,4,630306003X,"The only negative thing that I have to say about this video is that it's over too quickly. If you are a Blues Brothers fan and (like me) had only just been born when they were singing live, then this is your opportunity to see them in the act. Name your favourite song, and you'll most likely see it performed here. The majority of the songs from 'Briefcase Full of Blues' are on here but I'm afraid those from 'Made in America' aren't.
 Still, this video is well worn owning and includes an insightful interview with Dan Aykroyd and Elwood, which becomes very funny towards the end, then all of a sudden, poignant as they consider what effect the absence of John Belushi and Jake has had on the band.
 What I especially loved about the Blues Brothers is how they repeatedly acknowledged each individual member of the band. Whenever it's Steve Cropper's or Matt 'Guitar' Murphy's turn (Matt 'Muscle' Murphy if you ask me) for a solo, Belushi and Aykroyd are more than happy to step out of the spotlight and let them take over, whilst they have a cigarette in the corner or lie down and have a rest on the floor! (You'll have to get 'Saturday Night Live - The Best of John Belushi' to see the latter one!...",1005609600,11,1206,4.427927927927928
543996,5,630306003X,"This is a great video for fans of the blues brothers. Dan Aykroyd plays two roles at once-one as himself, one as Elwood blues. Each gives a story about the band, how it started, how it ended. This video contains hilarious performances, including the ""Killer Bee"" performance. Just gotta see it!",1000771200,6,294,4.784313725490196
543997,3,630306003X,"This DVD is good if you are a big fan of Belushi and Aykroyd but the interviews are poor.  This would have been better if the interview had concentrated on either Dan Aykroyd or Elwood but the live performances more than make up for this flaw.  Early recordings of their first live performance on Saturday Night Live is not to be missed!! The only other drawback of this was that there was no harmonicia lession as advertised which was disappointing and it's for this reason that I am not giving this a four star rating.  Generally, it's well worth buying of you want to see live performances but not worth it just for the interview",978825600,8,632,4.478260869565218
543998,1,630306003X,"If you adore the Blues Brothers, then you may be willing to overlook the poor monaural sound and sub-VHS-quality video on this ""Special Edition"" DVD just to see one more glimpse of our old favorites.
However, the sound is not just bad, it is like listening to a cheap transistor radio--totally tinny and with zero stereo separation, as shown on my spectrum analyzer, even though the disk is billed as having two channel digital sound.  (This is a problem with the DVD standard:  You can record a telephone call onto a DVD, and if you use two channels to do it, you can claim two-channel digital sound.)
The picture is not just bad, in many places we're left looking through a dim red fog at a bunch of unidentifiable dancing figures.  It is bad, really bad.  The worst I've ever seen on a on a commercial video in any format.
Instead of an honest, straight forward interview with Aykroyd, we're given a way-overproduced ""mockumentary,"" within which we are asked to separate the real from the imaginary.
The only honesty surrounding this disk, as limited as it is, comes in the disclaimer in 4 point type at the bottom of the back cover:  ""There may be some slight visual variances due to the state of the original master.""--The understatement of the century.",978048000,38,1258,4.67420814479638
543999,4,630306003X,"If you love The Blues Brothers (and who doesn't) this video would be a great addition to your collection. You get a lot of info about the origin of the band and the creation of the mythology of the characters. However, the best part is that it has a ton of footage from their concerts and tv appearances. Belushi would have been very pleased.",971049600,7,342,4.359375
544000,5,630306003X,"This video contains most of what any die hard Blues Brothers fan would need to know.  The origins of the band are talked over by Dan Ackroyd and Elwood. Most of the famous songs are in there including ones from SNL and  from their 1978 concert tour.  There are downsides though, the interviewer  is irritating and interrupts Ackroyd, and much of the older footage has  poor quality sound and visuals.  However if you like the blues brothers and  want to see Jake wearing different sunglasses and in one short a red hat,  then buy it!!!",913248000,9,535,4.557894736842106

544122,2,630306003X,"Somebody must have recorded this from Saturday Night Live, low quality video & terrible audio. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD. I've watched it twice & will give it to someone else.",1316217600,,192,4.514285714285714
544123,5,630306003X,"One of the greatest movies ever made. If you love music, REAL music, not that junk that's been produced for the past couple of decades, and you love action and comedy, then you will LOVE this movie.",1295740800,,198,4.378378378378378
544124,4,630306003X,Good music.  I enjot listening to the Blues Brothers.  They give a little different interpretation to some of the classic songs.  Surprising how good Belushi and Aykroid are as singers.,1257638400,,185,5.1
544125,5,630306003X,"When the Blues Brothers are singing, it's excellent.
When Elwood is doing the interview parts it's boring.

544126,4,630306003X,"The framework for this collection of live Blues Brothers performances is a pseudo-documentary retrospective featuring both Dan Ackroyd and Elwood Blues.  The production values on the live recordings is uneven, but they all manage to capture the unique energy of the Blues Brothers.

It's an interesting hour.  Beyond the performances, the interviews provide interesting insights into the characters and their history.

But this is more than an intellectual exercise.  This DVD has moments where real emotion comes through.  Ackroyd and his alter ego both loved their performing partners, and they both still feel and carry that loss with them.

IT may not be the best thing for someone who's just starting to get into the Blues Brothers - for that I'd suggest Briefcase Full of Blues and the first movie.  If you're already a big fan, this is something you should get for your collection.",1232496000,,888,5.075862068965518

544130,4,630306003X,I really enjoyed the footage of the Blues Brothers and can not expand on the good points raised in the other reviews.  A must for all fans.

7835842,4,630306003X,"I am part of a Blues Brothers tribute act and this DVD was priceless for watching & studying Dan & John's singing, stage presence, dancing, etc. to try to make our act as fun and accurate as possible.  I was really excited when I found all of these performances on one DVD, but I was also quite underwhelmed at the quality of the audio and the video.  The Saturday Night Live performances looked okay, but the live material was some of the worst live footage that I've ever seen of a concert.  Of course, you have to remember that this was all likely shot on analog Betamax tape back in about 1979 (remember when ""video"" actually WAS ""video tape""?).  When this came out on VHS back in the 1980's we were all watching it on our 19"" CRT televisions with a 4"" mono speaker inside.  On my 42"" flat screen and surround sound... Not as satisfying.
I can certainly understand the idea and the intent, but the ""interviews"" with Dan & Elwood in the bar were a bit cheesy.  Then again, this was filmed in about 1982, and not too many big-budget movies from that time frame have aged well either (Seen Ghostbusters lately?)  I did learn some interesting trivia, but the dialogue was a little stiff.
So, if you're willing to tolerate the marginal quality audio and video, but want to see ""Jake and Elwood"" performing at their peak, this DVD is a ""must have"" for true Blues Brothers fans.",1358899200,,1375,4.4541832669322705
