3033084,5,B000YLOKDS,"I have watched Jane's DVD several times and each time I learn even more!  I love her words of inspiration.  For example, the ""smooshed ribbon technique""  or ""I don't want it to be perfect.  I want it to look handmade because it is.""  Or, "" I save every ribbon I've ever received.  You never know.""
There are great closeup shots to show details of her work.  I like how the stitches are highlighted when Jane talks about different techniques.
The projects are fun and do-able! Jane is a great teacher.",1207872000,9,500,4.488888888888889

3033087,5,B000YLOKDS,"This is a really great video of ideas and techniques for making small quilts.  Also, ideas for embellishing any art quilt.  I especially liked the ideas for painting animals and quilting around it.  I can't wait to try this technique for my yellow lab.",1200182400,,252,4.681818181818182
3033088,5,B000YLOKDS,Jane's DVD is great for sparking my imagination. I'm a true beginner in making art quilts and the lessons here are very clear and easy to understand. I can watch it over and over and find something new each time. I like her use of combining all kinds of media in each quilt. I can't wait to paint my cats into an art quilt!,1200009600,3,323,4.0625
3033089,5,B000YLOKDS,"I was a lucky lady last summer when I took Jane LaFazio's Art Quilt class in San Diego.  With Jane's DVD release, I can re-live the class experience as often as I like.  Jane is the most creative person I've met in years and she inspires others to think outside the box.  This DVD will inspire your creativity, but not dictate it.  There was one class last summer that I didn't do that great at -- painting an image of my dog on canvas.  When I reviewed the contents of the DVD, I was less than thrilled that this technique was included.  Surprise, surprise!  I watched Jane's demonstration and thought, I would try this again.  (My problem was not the technique, but the too small, too detalied photo I selected.)  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to have fun with fabric, paints, etc - and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to truly thrill someone with a gift that will be used over and over again.  Can't wait for The Small Art Quilt Number Two!",1197417600,8,974,4.331491712707182
3033090,5,B000YLOKDS,This DVD does an exceptional job of presenting techniques clearly while including lots of projects to spark the imagination. It's well organized and easy to follow.  I look forward to more DVDs in this series.,1196726400,3,209,4.9714285714285715
3033091,5,B000YLOKDS,"Jane LaFazio's ""The Small Art Quilt"" is a great resource for the fiber artist. I got the DVD yesterday and watched it last night. It's wonderful! Jane is very clear in her descriptions, the instructions are easy to understand, and even though I have done some basic art quilts, I see how I can really add interest to future projects... I can't wait to put all this good information to use! I recommend it to anyone who is interested in Art Quilts as a creative outlet.",1196640000,5,468,4.453488372093023

8233388,5,B000YLOKDS,love her work,1416441600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8233389,1,B000YLOKDS,"This is horrible. It is vey expensive and is only an overview of her techniques. There is no in depth explanation of anything. Therefore, you are not able to even try any of the techniques. I have seen better video on You Tube! Supremely disappointing and I feel ripped off.",1381190400,4,274,4.5
8233390,5,B000YLOKDS,"This is a very informative and fun DVD.  Jane is a great teacher, very approachable and very talented.  I have enjoyed her class and the DVD was just as if I were in class again.  A good buy.",1376438400,,191,3.973684210526316
8233391,4,B000YLOKDS,Jane is a great teacher and I enjoyed her techniques.  I have an art background so her information made sense to me.  A beginner might not be comfortable with the design process but exposure is as valuable as anything.  Lots of inspiration.,1363737600,,240,4.666666666666667
8233392,5,B000YLOKDS,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Small Quilts Video by Jane LaFazio.  Jane's relaxed manner puts the viewer instantly at ease.  Her thoughtful, yet simple techniques make you want to dive right in creating and experimenting with fabric.  She presents three different styles of quilts, each one unique and beautiful.  I especially appreciate her attention to detail with the overviews of embellishing and finishing making it possible to develop a true work of art.",1276819200,,455,5.277777777777778
8233393,5,B000YLOKDS,"I'm sitting here watching Jane's DVD ""The Small Art Quilt"" and can I just say this right up front? I like Jane. I wish I lived next door to Jane. There is something about her personality that comes through on the screen that makes me think she would be a LOT of fun to hang out with. She talks with her hands. Her voice is nice. Her studio, her clothes, even the stuff on her table, are visually stimulating.
In chapter one Jane takes you through the entire process of making a wool felt, journal sized quilt. She shows you how to sketch out a pattern, choose your materials, cut them, glue them, stitch them, and assemble them. She talks about her materials along the way, her design process and the ""why"" of the ""what"" she is making. She truly makes the creation of art look simple and - yes YOU CAN do it!
Gotta say, it's making me want to make a wool felt quilt. No fraying edges to worry about - not that I actually worry about my fraying edges. I do think about whether I want them there or not and what they add to the design of the piece.
In chapter two you get to follow the creation of a painted quilt from the design process through to the finished piece. She works from a photo of her cute little kitty cat and shows you how to block out shapes and create a pattern. If you thought you needed to know how to draw before you could make a piece like this you are mistaken. Again - she shows you how easy it is.
The other techniques covered on the DVD include raw edge fabric collage, applying embellishments to your quilt, adding words, journaling for inspiration, stamping, and composition. I love the gallery section where she shows you an artwork she's made and explains the details and inspirations.
So - if you are an aspiring quilt artist - I really think you would love to own this DVD! As I mentioned, Jane is a great teacher and she generously shares a plethora of techniques and inspiration. Yup. Two thumbs up from me.",1274832000,3,1939,4.300546448087432
8233394,5,B000YLOKDS,"Jane LaFazio presents three separate and very different approaches to working with cloth and making art in The Small Art Quilt. She is both concise and engaging and her teaching style is very approachable.  Jane's confidence and spirit both inspires and motivates me to move into the studio and try out her techniques.  I have followed Jane's artistic growth through the internet and love the vigor she brings to every piece of art she creates, this video showcases that enthusiasm and simplifies the techniques she uses, making her processes easy and accessible at the same time. The details of her work and the peak into her studio are quite a treat too. I highly recommend this video.",1244332800,6,687,4.863247863247863
8233395,4,B000YLOKDS,I usually don't have the time or money to spend on mixed media art classes in today's economy so I look for informative classes on DVD's.  Jane's DVD on making small art quilts is great.  There are three projects on the DVD and each are explained clearly.  I learned so much and it gave me a great incentive to try something a little different.,1234828800,2,344,4.34375
8233396,5,B000YLOKDS,Jane is a constant creative inspiration. I'd recommend this DVD and anything she makes most heartily.,1228348800,2,101,5.375
8233397,5,B000YLOKDS,"I watched this DVD, went straight to my fabric stash and stated using her techniques! What fun!!!Everytime I see it, I pickup something new.

This is also a great DVD for children or teenagers wanting to explore expressing themselves through mixed media. With a little supervision (for younger kids) and some simple supplies - let the kids go! Do warn their parents - we had one child who went home an ripped up a few of her Mom and Dad's clothes (OOPS!) But her project was wonderful.

My favorite purchase of the year :-)
