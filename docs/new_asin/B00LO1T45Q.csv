6494323,1,B00LO1T45Q,"I probably should have been more mindful of the trailer, as this ""psychological thriller"" was just as much a bland experience as the trailer itself demonstrates. There were no scares (though, in fairness, it does not bill itself as a horror movie) or thrills, or even any interesting plot twists. I found it to be essentially a compilation of every standard ghost haunting microbudget, b-movie  that any casual fan of the genre has seen a million times over. The acting, too, was, at best, average, and sometimes distractingly poor. Obviously, you don't go into this one expecting The Conjuring or some Hollywood blockbuster, but even for c-horror, it was as boring as anything I've seen. Definitely can't recommend it. I can only suggest waiting until it comes out on Amazon Prime or another outlet for free. The only Unwanted Presence here was this video streaming on my laptop.",1418601600,12,880,4.945945945945946

6494353,2,B00LO1T45Q,"Honestly, WOULD HAVE given it a 4 stars, but I have some issues with this movie.

First, I love - and I do mean LOVE - horror flicks. All the guys I've dated in the past calls me a weird for a girl just because I love thrillers when it's usually going to end up being the case that girls are going to end up hating horror flicks (with, of course, those occasional few that loves it like I do). And this movie does have its potentials in terms of a horror story. But instead of starting it off with the suicide, I think it would have been better to start off with the showing of the brutal murder of the couple (or family?) that was mentioned during the movie and then showing glimpses of how it led to that famous news anchor person committing suicide. The plot does have a potential, but the script could have been written better in order to make it a better story.

Second, horrible acting. I couldn't help but laugh at the pure fact at how horrible all their acting skills were. And those singing cleaning people? Oh, C'MON! Who the hell actually likes cleaning the bathroom? And even if there are people that even lies to clean bathrooms, can you say a bit too enthusiastic much? I mean, no one can be THAT excited about cleaning the bathroom!

Third, again, the plot could have done a lot better. This movie just seemed like a bit rushed and somewhat poorly written for the purely the fact of having to rush it.

I won't lie - This story line has potential. But is it worth watching? I wouldn't really say so.",1476316800,,1514,4.283216783216783

6494377,2,B00LO1T45Q,"I just saw the first 20 minutes of the show.  So I will report on that.  The first person in the house was a young woman who seemed very distraught over her life.  She committed suicide and it showed this scene.  Then her friend tried to get in touch with her via phone and could not.  So she went to her house which was locked and no one answered so she called the police and they opened the door with a special technique.  Then
 found the young woman in her bedroom dead.  I stopped watching it then.,,, J70",1475798400,,509,4.122448979591836

6494419,1,B00LO1T45Q,"Spoiler alert re part of ending.  It is not often that you get to watch a movie this badly scripted or acted.  It has the feel of an after-school special mixed with canned religious preachiness, albeit the topic is a little adult for school-aged children.  It's not funny enough to be a spoof, and it's not scary enough to be rated as even a thriller.  The instant conversion at the end from agnosticism or atheism to Christianity makes a mockery of not only Christianity but individual spirituality as well.  But this movie is just too silly to really tear apart.  I watched it all the way through because it was so bad that I found that in and of itself entertaining.",1473465600,,669,4.487603305785124

One could argue that almost the first 20 minutes were very inconsequential.  The two most important things that happened were 1. there was a suicide and 2. the house was bought by a new person.  They could have just opened with that.  We don't need to see where the suicidal lady worked, or the process of the real estate agent trying to clean the house and sell it.  But some of you may ask, ""Will we get to see how the real estate agent meets the new purchaser of the haunted house?""  Not to worry people, that's all been explained in the first act!!!

Despite this being a terrible movie I did find it amusing.  I laughed at the terrible effects, the terrible acting, and the snails pace that it moved the story along.  I think this movie could be cut to about 25 minutes and be a lot better.

I was very interested in the the movie because it was based on a true story which I completely related to after going through four terrifying years of having an evil presence in my home. I was not living a Christian life and hadn't for many years but I remembered how to pray and through the power and glory of God and the power of consistent prayer in the name of Jesus, my home was cleansed. I rededicated my life to Jesus Christ so the ending of the movie really struck a chord with me. I'm glad that a faith based movie finally dealt with the dark side of the spiritual world because so many Christians don't seem to believe in the powers of darkness any more but they should.

I don't mind movies that promote ideas per se. However, I do mind movies that shove it down your throat with a wooden spoon hoping you either choke to death on it or swallow it. The movie pretty much pretends that Jesus Christ is the only answer, and that all the alternatives are nothing short of being a waste of time and effort. In fact, they go so far as to repeat the exact same scene two times just to make sure you heard it right. The only thing that can help is the power of Christ. Left field, much?

This has a religious message that in some ways can be helpful, without being overly zealous. There are strong female characters throughout the movie, and a group of busy-bodies and gossips that I am sure were another ""message"" being sent. The ending is a little flaky.

6494634,1,B00LO1T45Q,"If this is the best that Christians can offer, it is no wonder the religion is losing members in the U.S.  This was an embarrassment to film making on many levels.  Let me count the ways.

ACTING

Simply put:  It was terrible, though not the worst that I have seen.  None of the actors was believable.  At times when you think that someone should be shocked at something jumping out at her, they didn't react.  The facial expressions weren't congruent with what was happening in the scene.  The actor playing the apparition, which we finally see near the end, tried her best to be scary.  Instead, she came off as hammy and ridiculous.

PLOT

Just as everyone else stated, it was trite.  What I found particularly annoying--and I have noticed this about the recent spate of religious films--is that the screen writers know that many people aren't going to be attracted to Christian movies because of how terrible they have consistently been in the past, so they try to bury their goal of proselytizing deep in the film, or they try to slide it in near the end after they have had people commit their valuable time to something terrible.  This fails every time.  The message is always presented in a corny fashion, and it always espouses more questions than it tries to answer.

EFFECTS

There were only a handful, and they all seemed like they were done by first-year special-effects students.  Just an embarrassment.  The apparition looked absolutely ridiculous.

OVERALL

I also want to state that I think it's pretty pathetic what Christian producers and directors are reduced to these days.  There isn't any imagination in what is being done.  Because horror films are en vogue, they want to cash in.  The problem is that it's difficult to marry their beliefs with what the complex puzzle pieces needed to make a horror film truly good.  The result will always be the same:  Everyone has to convert to Jesus to make everything all right.

If this movie is supposed to show people the true power of God (through conquering a powerful evil), it failed spectacularly.",1428969600,6,2068,4.752112676056338

First off, the ghost story starts off with a suicide. I did not appreciate having a doctor in a scene telling the soon to be dead person that she has Multiple Sclerosis and that there is no cure. I have M.S. and have been living with it for almost a decade. No, there is no cure but the life span average of a person with M.S. is the same as an average person. There was no need to put that in and was personally offended by it. If the creators of this movie are truly ""Christian"" they would have known better to condemn the entire M.S. community to death. I believe that in the Christian religion, God is the Only One who can judge. I hope you look at yourself and this creation see how you have perverted your own teachings.

1. There is a bad ghost.
2. Psychic and ghost hunters are brought in.
3. They can tell there is a ghost but can' t make it go away.

!!!!! I'm going to give away the ending here so stop if you want to see it for yourself !!!!!

4. If you allow Jesus Christ into your life, all will be fine and dandy. It took all of 10 seconds to corner the ghost and vanquish it from the home.
