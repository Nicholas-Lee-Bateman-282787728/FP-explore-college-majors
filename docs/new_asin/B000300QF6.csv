8035469,5,B000300QF6,"Tea Society of a Witch is pretty ground breaking for those who are aware of what it is. It's a dating sim, a phenomenon that is incredibly popular over in Japan (where this was created). Some of these sims have spawned countles sequels, manga, live action shows, and anime. Surprisingly this is the one facet of the anime & Japan culture that has yet to be brought over fully to the US audience. (There are hentai sims brought over which aren't necessarily the same as the more mainstream dating sims.) TSoaW did originally start off as a hentai dating sim, which means that the naughty bits were taken out to make it more sellable to the US public and to show them that dating sims aren't just hentai fodder. Now a part of the dating sim world is the visual novel, which is similar to a sim but is mostly comprised of text and pictures. There are choices, but some novels will have fewer choices while others will have hundreds of opportunities to make decisions affecting the game's outcome. TSoaW is more visual novel than dating sim, which is understandable considering that this was a DVD port rather than a PC port. Regular dating sims are far more involved and some require a saving point. (Important info for knowing exactly what this game is.)

The story surrounds our everyman Rokusuke as he meets several different witches who have come to earth to study magic. He ends up having to house the clumsy Nee, who is seemingly the most untalented of all of the witches. From there the player is given the option of selecting what Rokusuke is going to be doing that day, options that usually surround a specific character. Choosing a majority of options for a specific character should cause the ending for that person, however it should be noted that two of the endings were deleted (Ponica and Manamu) for reasons unknown. (The Ponica ending was undoubtedly deleted due to her appearing as a child, which could cause some players to view it as the pedophile choice.)

The play value in this is surprisingly good considering some of the other visual novels that have been put out by the same company. (A previous attempt by the now defunct Anime Play had little to no interaction.) TSoaW has at least 50-70 different choices from what I can remember. It's not difficult to pick the path you prefer, although I will say that trying to play it down the middle will result in you getting a ""bad"" ending. Many should be aware that this is NOT an anime video, nor is there any animation in this game. The game is comprised of a series of still pictures with text and voiceovers, which is the norm for dating sims & visual novels. The artwork to this game is pretty good, so there's a lot to look at here with detail. The voice acting and translation are also pretty good, so that's a plus on that point. The only weak point is the missing endings, which will frustrate some players who want to complete all of the endings. It's a good value for the money.

8035470,2,B000300QF6,"I'd been wanting this DVD-game for about 2 or 3 years before actually purchasing it. I think that might've added to my disappointment when it finally arrived.

I ignored the other reviews, thinking the people just had a lower tolerance for these kind of games (and a few admitted to not even knowing that it was meant to be a game, not an anime).

Well, for something that was meant to be a game and not an anime, it doesn't allow for much interaction.

The game plays itself pretty much for you, except on the off-chance that you actually get to give some input as the main character. The images on the screen rarely move, as you're watching the same scene for a about 15 minutes at a time. I played it for about an hour before I finally got fed up with it. The least the could've done was thrown in a little movement while you watch...

I gave this 2 stars for the sheer fact that I hadn't finished it and that it might've potentially gotten more interesting after the point at which I gave up. (Btw, they don't really give you much opportunity to save. As I hadn't been given the option throughout the duration of my playing time, I'd have to start all over if I ever decided to pick it up again).

So consider yourself warned.",1154995200,2,1230,4.307359307359308
8035471,4,B000300QF6,"In this DVD game you play Rokusuke Nonaka, a high school boy whose parents are overseas on bussiness. He is staying in an apartment by himself. In another room across the hall his cousin, Megumi Yuuhi, high school girl who goes to the same class as him, lives. Megumi has a hobby reading tarot cards and making predictions, and often stays up late doing this, and so many times she can't get up in the morning by herself to go to school, and Rokusuke must wake her up himself. One morning twords the end of the school year when he is getting her up, she tells him about her latest tarot prediction. She says he's going to die soon. He is shocked at this, but also quite skeptical. They go out to head off for school, when she suddenly remembers something she forgot. (Or maybe she just doesn't want to be around him whenever the thing that's supposed to kill him happens.) While she's gone he hears what sounds like a jet flying by overhead, and then hears what sounds like an explosion in the air, and wonders what's going on. He hears a girl shouting that she's about to fall where he is and to get out of the way. Just then a girl in strange, oversized clothes on a metallic object flies into him, banging him directly on the forehead and landing on top of him. The girl is apologetic at first, until she finds out that his hand has ended up in an inapropriate place. He insists he didn't mean it, but she smacks him and walks off. Soon after an older woman in a skimpy outfit shows up. She says her name's Akiwo and she's looking for a girl who's a witch that she was flying with. She says the girl is quite reckless in the air. She then leaves him to think it must just be his day to meet crazy people. He then goes to school and meets Megumi at the entrance and tells her about the girl who ran into him on what he thinks was a motorcycle. They go to class, and find it unusually crowded. They see Manamura, shy, timid, glasses-wearing girl who is sad about the fact that someone took her seat. Megumi volenteers to get the person out, but Manamu says she'll just stand out in the hall. Megumi says she was running away, and acts like Rokusuke should know something about it. Then they see the source of the attention. Two girls in strange outfits-a blonde-haired girl in a blue uniform who has a little dog who she calls Poochie, and a short, grey-haired girl with a sardonic demenor who calls herself Ponica, are looking for a place to stay. All the guys are argueing with each other over who gets to have the cute girls stay with them. Rokusuke walks up to them and says this is a class where people have to study and they'll have to leave. The blonde girl says her name is Drill and she's a highly elite witch from the Kingdom Of Magic who's come to our world to continue studying. She says they came with Nee, their classmate, but she got seperated while flying. Then Kishio Okiba, snobbish rich boy and class president, comes in. He offers Drill a place to stay, and all the other guys dispair since they know they can't compete with him. Drill wants to leave right away. Kishio is hesitant, since that would mean walking out of class, and Drill then says she'll have to find someone eles. Reluctantly, Kishio leaves class with her. The guys then start argueing over who Ponica gets to stay with, but then Megumi says Ponica will stay with her. Then Nee walks in, and both she and Rokusuke are shocked to see each other again. She says she too needs a place to stay, and once again the guys argue over who she gets to stay with. She says she's a witch, and when Rokusuke makes it clear he doesn't believe her, she decides to prove it. She utters a chant to summon a small gust of wind, but the spell proves far more powerful than she intended and it blows out a whole window and part of the wall! Rokusuke is stunned that magic is real, Nee is shocked that her spell caused so much damage, and suddenly none of the guys want her staying with them. She  leaves. The teacher walks in and is horrifyed to see the damage done. Ponica tells Megumi she'll meet her outside, then flies out the hole on her broom. The teacher is stunned, and goes home early. After leaving class, Megumi tells Rokusuke she'll meet with Ponica, and that he should go find Nee since she doesn't have anyone to stay with. After leaving school again, Rokusuke runs into Akiwo again, who says she's Nee's teacher, that Nee is a klutz, and asks him to look after her while Akiwo goes shopping. She leaves him thinking she's such an irresponsible teacher. As the sun starts to set, he finds Nee in town asking various people if she can stay with them but not getting anywhere. He watches from afar. Finally the sun sets, and having not found anyone suitable to stay with, she decides she'll have to sleep in the park. Rokusuke feels bad, so he offers her to stay with him. She wants nothing to do with him at first, but then her stomach starts growling, and she agrees to come with him. She uses magic to shrink her metallic broom so that she can fit it in her hat, and they go to his apartment where she has a little dinner. She tells him this semester for witches is called the ""Tea Party"". There are some more comedic mishaps when she is in his apartment, then we come to the choices.

At several points in the story, you get to pick between three different girls to hang out with-Nee, Drill, or Manamu. You can end up with anyone of the three as your girlfrend, or you can blow it and end up with none of them and be sad and lonely when the witches return to their world. (Here's a hint to get a good ending: pick one girl to see at the start of the game and stay with that one for the whole game. Do not alternate between the girls during the course of anyone game.) Also don't think that if you choose to hang out with Manamu that magic takes a back-seat. Akiwo will take notice of you, and decide to help out...

People who are used to the more realistic art of previous interactive anime disks may be a bit put off by the super-deformed art here, but I enjoyed it. There are also several points where we see a computer graphics screen with the characters appearing in tiny form when an action happens. (Such as when Nee runs into Rokusuke, when Nee summons the wind, when she shrinks her broom, or when she's in Rokusuke's apartment and spreads out some futons to sleep in the kitchen because she doesn't want to sleep with him.) There are several funny moments here and I had alot of fun playing through the various story lines. It's a good one to check out.",1145836800,,6547,4.30388978930308
8035472,4,B000300QF6,"This DVD was very good. I liked the story of the witches coming to Earth to train. The music is good, too. My only complaint is that two of the character don't have endings in it.",1128902400,,179,4.0
