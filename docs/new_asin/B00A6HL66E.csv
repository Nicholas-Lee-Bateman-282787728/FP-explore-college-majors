8546980,4,B00A6HL66E,"Frank (Ray Winstone) is institutionalized because of severe Alzheimer disease. He doesn't have the cute Hollywood version where a man forgets to wear his pants from time to time, but rather one where he becomes violent and remembers things like how to hot wire automobiles. His son (Luke Evans) shows up at the institute and breaks him out, although we soon discover his reason is not as benign as it appears on the surface as Luke tries to save both Frank and his family.

The film has a number of twists. The problem of dealing with an Alzheimer's patient is presented in such a way that it should be left to professionals.

This is a well acted, well developed story.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1479340800,2,713,4.5984251968503935
