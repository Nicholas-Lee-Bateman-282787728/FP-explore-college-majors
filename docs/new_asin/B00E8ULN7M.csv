8602742,4,B00E8ULN7M,"I love South Korean horror films, and this was a treat! To me, this is like 2 stories put together. The first 15-20 minutes is about the best friend becoming a loner due to bullying from school. Then the main story is about the main character also becoming a loner due to a family secret. This is a great movie as it has you guessing till the very end with a nice twist you would never have imagined, it connects with what happened at the very beginning of the movie. I love all asian horror films, with South Korea being my favorite. This is a good pick-up for any horror fan!",1389398400,,577,4.207207207207207
