5979419,5,B00FEDP6H0,"This movie stands out among the many B-Movie Hollywood efforts that I saw as a young man. My friends and I were expecting to have fun mocking the poor production that the hokey title suggested. Instead we were all captivated by the story and special effects. I suggested we see this movie because someone at school kept raving about how the Aliens would turn to jello and oatmeal when they died. I just had to see that.

It is funny how a movie with such a bad title can turn out to be the exact opposite of what you expect when you see it. I am looking forward to seeing it again when the DVD is delivered. A good script and competent acting still make for a good movie even today where too many movies rely solely on CGI effects to carry a weak script and sub par acting.  I was a fan of the original Outer Limits and The Twilight Zone for these very reasons. I remember a episode where Agnes Moorehead  was tormented by tiny Aliens and no spoken words were uttered until the very end, when it turns out the tiny Aliens are Earthmen ! These shows proved that good scripts and acting are what make a good show. When these elements are present, magic happens.  When I was growing up I was constantly comparing every movie to ""Forbidden Plant"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" as well as Gene Barry's ""War of the Worlds"". Sadly most of them fell far short of these great movies. I was an adult when I saw the premier showing of ""Star Wars"" at the Cinerama theater in downtown Seattle. I instantly had a new criteria to judge Science Fiction movies. ""Blade Runner"" and the original  ""Planet of the Apes"" were added to my judgment scale. Even the Japanese movie ""The Mysterians"" was good for it's time.

I am looking forward to seeing ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" when it is released on DVD. The Raccoon character sounds a little like Porsupah the alien in the Alan Dean Foster story ""BloodHype.""",1407715200,5,1893,4.394285714285714

8614758,5,B00FEDP6H0,"Something seems strange about the old gang. They gave up alcohol and oxygen. And Bill Farrell (Tom Tryon) seems even stranger. Oh it's his wedding night. Anyway Marge Bradley Farrell (Gloria Talbott) is starting to suspect that something is afoot. Maybe more than the foot is being substituted. Why does Bill tell her that he is just learning how to love?
Stay tuned for her shocking revelation and dilemma on ""Who can you trust.""

There is a little more psychological depth of thought that went into this movie. It is not just another ""Earth girls are easy"" script. You may even find yourself rooting for the substitute.",1500595200,,621,4.803738317757009

8614763,3,B00FEDP6H0,"Released in 1958 and shot in B&W, I Married a Monster from Outer Space stars Gloria Talbott as a newlywed in Southern Cal who starts to suspect her husband is an alien from outer space (Tom Tryon).

Despite the silly title, the tone is serious and the special effects regarding the aliens and the way they possess people (or whatever) are quite good for the era. Right from the get-go the viewer knows whos being taken over and we then observe the protagonist slowly figure it out, which leads to a well-done confrontation between the wife and non-husband. The second half reveals why the aliens do what they do and its kinda melancholic. All this points to why its considered a minor cult classic. Movies like this are worthwhile simply as historical artifacts to view American society in the late 50s, but compared to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and the monumental Forbidden Planet (1956) I Married a Monster from Outer Space is second rate.

The film runs 78 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California.
