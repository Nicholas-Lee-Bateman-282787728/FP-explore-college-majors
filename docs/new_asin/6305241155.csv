1006040,5,6305241155,"I personally liked this video. The episodes do have a different flavor than the original Tenchi series. The animation style is more comical but adds a fresh flavor to the Tenchi verse. I like the concept of Tenchi  ""moving away"". It certainly opens up some unique possibilities  (Washu's portal). Sakuya is a welcome addition to Tenchi's cast. its nice  to see a 'normal' woman in Tenchi's life....and one that he may return the  affections of. I hope the series shows a more sentimental side in later  episodes. On thing that makes Tenchi great is its ability to make you cry  as well as laugh (the end of the first Tenchi movie for example). I can't  wait for the rest of the series.",920332800,,685,4.565573770491803
1006081,1,6305241155,"I have to admit. When I watched the first episode, I laughed. Then I got passed the first 10 minutes and realized this serise was going straight to hell. Tenchi Muyo is a SciFI/Romanitc Comedy, not a fast passed silly anime like Excel Saga of Dragon Half. The list of bad features goes on.
- The art is terrible. Looks nothing like the original beautiful art style of the OVA and T.V. show.
- The music is God awful. It's like listening to the soundtrack of DBZ or even worse, the Yu Yu Hakusho movie. They should have just stuck with the synth music.
- This is by far the worst dub Tenchi Muyo has ever faced. Which is really sad because the previous dubs were really good. They added way too much idiotic diologue that ruins even some of the bad gags.
- Sakuya is about as interesting as wire. A plane, ordinary, wire.
- Why is Ayeka suddenly a ragin psycopath?
Avoid this serise at all cost. It's not worth your money.",1079308800,4,921,4.2988505747126435
1006082,3,6305241155,"Note: These comments are for several of the Tenchi in Tokyo DVDs I've seen.
The extras for the series are almost non-existant. Each DVD will have one or two of the following: Conceptual drawings, Japanese music video, or commercial. Regarding the video, no subtitles are provided, nor are you even told which character in the Tenchi series the singer played. The commercial doesn't have subtitles, either.
This also has to be one of the poorest DVD menus I've seen. It's not obvious on the main screen when you've selected something; the buttons are different colors, shapes, and placements; and you'll have to go through two screens and several button presses to change from the default English to Japanese language with subtitles. Considering that these are the two most common forms of viewing, converting between the two should only be a toggle.
Otherwise, I'll just say that I enjoyed the series. The Tokyo characters aren't the same characters in their previous incarnations. If you have to have your entertainment that way, don't watch this series. But Tenchi in Tokyo is far better viewing than most of ""what's on tv"" so I'll recommended it.",1042761600,,1149,4.989583333333333
1006083,1,6305241155,this is the worst anime that i have bought in 10 years of collecting. I love the ova and tv show but this is not the Tenchi I know and love.,1030492800,,140,3.5483870967741935
1006084,2,6305241155,"The first Tenchi Muyo! TV Series was all right.  Tenchi Universe was prefect.  Tenchi In Tokyo has got to be the worst Tenchi Muyo! TV series ever made.  I love the whole Tenchi universe, but not Tenchi In Tokyo.  ""Tenchi in Hell"" might be a better title for this so-so series.
 Tenchi In Tokyo features two new cast members, Yugi and Sakuya.  Yugi is a super mutant created on Jurai 3,600 years ago. She is sent to Earth (god knows why). 3,600 years later, Yugi is awakened. Yugi wants her own kingdom to replace Earth. Her ""Kingdom"" is made out of crystals and three of her servants that she made.  Sakuya is a girl that Tenchi meets while in Tokyo.
  Sakuya is disliked by Akeya and the others at the household of Masaki (gee, i wonder why).
  Yugi and her three servants create bizzare and useless spirits, such as the Cell-phone god and the Marriage Goddess. These spirits causes mayhem for Tenchi and the gang.
  The animation is poor, the characters look a little different, and the plot is weak.  However, I think it's worth watching the entire series at least once.  I had mixed feelings of how the series ended.",1015804800,,1121,4.507462686567164
1006085,3,6305241155,"With each remake, Tenchi seems to get weaker.  Tenchi in Tokyo is okay, with a few elements that I really liked, but others that I couldn't stand.  I can only fear for the latest Tenchi series, which has been released in Japan.  Note: this review is a basic overview of the series itself, not just this individual tape.

The basic premise of the series that Tenchi moves to Tokyo, leaving all the girls behind.  There, Tenchi meets Sakuya and they fall in love.  Meanwhile, back home, all the girls are wildly jealous and are constantly trying to get Tenchi back home, away from the girl.  In addition, there is a dark power in the background, trying to tear them apart.

The weakest part of series is definitely the animation.  I was used to the rich color pallet and lush detail of Tenchi Muyo! and Tenchi Universe, to an extent.  However, the animation in this is lackluster and the colors are completely washed out.  The character designs are, unfortunately, completely lacking in detail.  The characters themselves seem weaker as well.  Yugi, with a history and personality, is the most compelling bad guy I have ever come across in the Tenchi saga.  And the conclusion is one of the sweetest, most beautiful, and most Tenchi-esque thing I have ever seen.

All in all, you can skip this series.  You will probably be disappointed if you're a die-hard fan of the previous series, but the casual viewer may or may not be entertained.",1014940800,,1436,4.684
1006086,3,6305241155,"When I heard about the Tenchi in Tokyo series was coming on toonami, I was glad. Unfortunely, My happiness turned into a huge disappointment. All of the key elements have been stripped away. Now instead of a good story and cool characters, we get a lame story and subpar characters. The animation is okay, but Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe are leagues better. The voice acting has changed dramatically. Now instead of Noboyuki somewhat hilarious voice, we get a nerdy voice. Also, since when do both Kiyone and Mihosi like Tenchi? Tenchi Universe made a lot more sense than this, and I like to add that the main villian, Yugi, is not my idea of a bad guy. At least Kagato was a cool villian. This is not a bad series(it still maintainds that quirky sense of humor) but could have been improved.",1004918400,,796,4.573426573426573
1006087,3,6305241155,"This series is definitely not as good as the others mainly cause of the animation but some of the stories are stupid. The first episoded was ok and you don't have to see Tenchi meet all of the girls AGAIN untill later. The story was boring and the animation was bad.
The second episode was better and had a nice story between Sakuya and Tenchi and there were some romantic scenes too.
The third was sooo bad the whole ""destroy long distance relationships"" was so stupid and what the hell happened to Ryo ohki.
The last episode was really good and again focused on Tenchi and Sakuya and it was quite nice animation to.
If your a fan you have probably already brought this but I would just buy the important episodes on volume 5,7 and 8 and save the money to buy the Tenchi movies which are A LOT better. :)",1004659200,,805,4.302631578947368
1006088,3,6305241155,"Shin Tenchi Muyo! (Tenchi in Tokyo) isn't exactly my favorite anime in the world. Don't get me wrong here, I absolutely loved the OAV and the first TV series. However, the animation here is subpar and the characters are somewhat--non appealing. The storyline is different and so is the fact on how the girls came to Earth. Typically, the animators were cursed--the faces are completely weirder than the other series and the eyes are so ugly! They should have taken their time, because it seems like they rushed. Also, they need to revise their new characters, especially Sakuya Kumashiro. She is somewhat of a nuisance after you hear her voice over and over again in your head. The humor is still there. I laughed my head off when the girls go off to Tokyo in search for yen. Even if the DVD wasn't what I expected, it will still have a place on my shelf.",1002499200,,855,4.52258064516129
1006118,5,6305241155,"Tenchi in Tokyo always seems to get bad mouthed by a lot of people, but I think it's great.  It's fast paced, funny, and surreal.  Can you argue with the giant cell phone guy, or Tenchi doing calligraphy in an elephant costume?  I think not. Total fun.",999302400,,252,4.319148936170213
1006119,2,6305241155,"I am an avid worshipper or the Tenchi Muyou! universe.  If I were forced to pick three favorite anime, Tenchi would undoubtably find its way into the list.  This is why this DVD instills feelings shock, depression, and suicidal tendencies.  The animation is on par with Sailor Moon TV episodes at their best moments (for all of you Moonies, take note: this is not a compliment).  Perhaps the former animators caught the Plague; there has to be a rational explanation for why this series' animation lacks smootheness, detail, and height/weight proportionate characters.  Tenchi's grunge motif seems out of place for those of us who are accustomed to the more retro-80s look of any other Tenchi incarnation.  The plot is debased to something one would find on a Saturday morning cartoon (yes, I used the 'c' word; pardon my indiscretion).  The monsters (I still don't understand what they were thinking will cell-phone man) once again remind me of Bishoujo Senshi in tackiness and lack of quality and originality.  Furthemore, the music for the ending is an affront against god (unless you actually like japanese-folk-country).  However, this is still Tenchi, and Tenchi in Toukyou's appeal mainly rests in its relation to the rest of the Tenchi universe.  If you have to see all of Tenchi, enjoy.  The series does get slightly better, but not enough to warrant purchasing the series.  I would have given this DVD one star, but Ryo-Ohki! turns into a big, pink mecha, and you have to admit that's pretty kawaii.  If I sounded somewhat acidic, it is merely due to the fact that I love Tenchi Muyou, Tenchi Universe, the three movies, and Pretty Sammy, and this was most disappointing.",992995200,4,1681,4.918439716312057
1006120,1,6305241155,"I fell in love with the Tenchi Muyo series when I first saw Magical Girl Pretty Sammy (One of the cutest animes in my opinion) I saw the OAV and the TV series and thought it was very cute and original.  Eventually I saw Tenchi in Tokyo/Shin Tenchi Muyo and I thought it was HORRIBLE.  Here are the reasons why:
1)The animation: I know thats a bad reason but it's really annoying after your use to the original animation.  I think it's very underdeveloped compared to all the other series.
2) Character changes: I think they made a lot of personality changed with a lot of the characters.  Sasami seemed like some sorta of cooking freak, I didn't find her cute at all!  Kiyone was very interested in Tenchi.  The impression I got from Kiyone in the other series was that she just wanted to be friend with him.  The other thing is that Ryo-ohki is Sasami's instead of Ryoko's and it transforms into some horrid robot.
3) Reused: Sometimes I feel like the only one that believe this but I think Tenchi in Toyko has almost the exact same story line as the second movie: Manatsu no Eve.  Here's why:  They are both about a female child who was banished form the planet Jurai for reasons beyond their control.  Some odd years later they want to get revenge.  They both create teenage girls to disracted Tenchi and basically cause trouble.  Only real difference I see is that Yuzuha wants to destroy Jurai and Yugi wants to take over Earth.
I would recomend seeing a little bit of this series though if you like Tenchi.  There are many mixed reviews about it so you should really find out if you like it.",985046400,3,1597,4.428082191780822
1006121,1,6305241155,"Tenchi in Tokyo is terible. The series was not even close acting like the OVA or the Unverse Series. It startes out as a stupid plot with dumb background music. Since when does Tenchi wanted to be a priest like his grandfather. In the other series Tenchi was training for unknown purposes, but in this series he goes to some dumpy city called Tokyo to learn to be a Shento priest. There was a lot of spoofs from that popular show Sailor Moon. The villans are completely lame. Darn they even got rid of Noboyuki's Homer Simpson sounding voice and replaced it with a cliche father sounding voice. Ryo-Ohki sides with Sassammi than with Ryoko which really bites. Giving Tenchi a girl friend who is just as ugly as Ayeka takes the cake. Most of the characters except Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Sakura are seldomly used. They must have found the script for this series in a trashcan. The catfights are very short and poor. But if your a Tenchi fan at heart go ahead and watch to see what happens later on in the other episodes.",982627200,,1021,4.46524064171123
1006122,4,6305241155,"AIC is making itself known by bringing back old classics. Tenchi Muyo was for adults and Tenchi Universe was for kids. This series is for teenagers. A lot of things have changed. Tenchi is off to Tokyo to start high school. One of Tenchi's old friends from the original Tenchi Muyo is back in here and once again another women is after Tenchi and so is a new enemy. The reason for this is not yet given and why Sakuya is all over Tenchi is anyones guess. Fortunetely for the girls back home, they can visit Tenchi through the dimentional tunnel, developed by Washu. The main point of this series is basically focused on the comedy. Thats why you'll notice there is some super deformity. The gag of the girls always trying to get to see Tenchi follows throughout the series and is sometimes funny. Lots of things have changed and yer gonna have to wait awile until everything is explained. Some people who are familiar with Tenchi Universe are going to look at this and say 'What the heck'. This isn't really for devoted Tenchi fans, but if you liked the series and have no emotional hang ups, then this might be worth a look. I really wish the design of the monsters were done better though.",978739200,,1191,4.467889908256881

Despite the fact it's aimed more in the direction of children with it's more extravagant details. Though my only real complaint would be the different people that they got for some of the voices. But as my overall opinion it's still halerious.,978048000,,357,4.868852459016393
1006124,3,6305241155,"A New Start is a fitting name for this disc, since it has no relation whatsoever to any of the previous Tenchi story lines. Much like the Tenchi Universe series, Tenchi In Tokyo is yet another radical retelling of the same story. And like Tenchi Universe, Tenchi In Tokyo really pales in comparison to the original and still the best OAV series. Although it falls short of living up its OAV heritage, it's not a bad series by any stretch of the imagination. It's still fun and goofy, but it lacks polish and scale that made people gravitate to Tenchi in the first place. Thankfully, there's the manga out there to continue the original story line.",977875200,,647,4.586206896551724
1006125,5,6305241155,"True, Tenchi in Tokyo does not have the sci-fi feel of the OVA or Tenchi Universe, but I mean, you have to have some diversity! This series a bit more slow-paced, and you can see that the art is a lot different, so you may be thrown off at first. But do not be fooled! This is the Tenchi that you love to watch. Everyone is here, including a few new characters. This is only the beginning of the series, and I believe they do a great job of setting it up for the rest of the episodes. And as any good show would do, it leaves you hungry for more. So expect yourself to possibly shell out some more money for the other tapes in the series. If you love Tenchi, you should get this series by all means. However be warned, there is a lot less of the sci-fi stuff, and the story is very localized (unlike being all over the universe) so don't expect to find too much of elements from the older series.

Theres alot more comedy in the Tokyo series,  which makes up for the animation being a bit less lower in quality.  Tenchi  is given a job as a shrine keeper's helper in Tokyo, and this gets the  girls at the Masaki home all crazy.  While in Tokyo, Tenchi has to go to  school as usual, and the most popualar girl in school, Sakuya, starts to  have a love interest in him.  She is certainly competition for Ryoko and  Ayeka to get mad at.

Brings back bad memories of Tenchi Forever,  though. DON'T see that movie. The comedy really cracked me up! I don't  think that Mihoshi and I really got enough screen time, though, but hey, my  opinion. Nobuyuki (sp?) has a much better voice and i'm glad. Now he  doesn't sound like Homer Simpson, but he doesn't seem as pervertish as  before. I'm gonna miss that. (Kinda.) When did the pink cabbit gundam come  in, may I ask? I dislike Sakuya intensely.

These episodes, from the TV series, are much lighter in tone than the movies, with the  ""wackiness ensues"" aesthetic that informs titles such as Ranma  1/2.
The art is (obviously) not as impressive as in the various movies,  but the plot is enjoyable, even if there are a few too many cliffhangers.  If you are already a Tenchi fan, you may very well want to buy (or rent)  this; otherwise you probably should start with one of the movies,  ""Tenchi Muyo in Love"", or ""The Daughter of Darkness"".",952128000,,614,4.4375

So when I saw  volume 1 laying on the shelf of my favorite comics store, I was more then a  little hesitant to buy it.  About a month later I finally gave in and  shelled out my 25 bucks.  I went home, watched it....and loved it!  Given,  the animation is different, and so is the style of humor, but I quickly got  used to it and laughed till I had to pee.

Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya.

7887020,4,6305241155,"Granted, there are things I don't care for in the ""Tenchi in Tokyo"" series.  The backstory of how Tenchi and the girls came to live together is, in my opinion, the least interesting of the three Tenchi ""realities"" presented by the series.  But I found this series intriguing for several reasons.

First...in this series, Tenchi seems more like a real boy in real life situations.  Yes, he still lives in a house with a space pirate, space cops, a crazed genius, two alien princesses, etc., but being sent off to school in Tokyo is a very realistic situation for Tenchi to find himself in.  He makes friends, he meets the popular yet enigmatic Sakuya, and the awkward beginnings of their relationship is very sweet and touching to watch.  It's the first time we get to see Tenchi as a normal boy falling in love with a normal girl.  Although we find out later that Sakuya isn't who she seems to be, the tender, tentative moments they share as their relationship grows are priceless.

The rest of the gang find themselves having to deal with more realistic situations as well...they find that it takes a lot of money to run such a large household, and they have to venture out to find jobs in order to buy food and pay bills. This, plus Yugi's efforts to break up the Masaki household with her intriguing band of ""shadows"" does give ""Tenchi in Tokyo"" a darker, harsher reality than the other two series, but that does not mean that there are no laughs to be had, and no shortage of touching moments.  Relationships get strained and tested to their limits, but in this we get to see the real depth of feelings that the Tenchi gang has for one another.  This is what makes it impossible for Yugi to defeat them, despite her efforts to divide and conquer.  It's also what is able for them to ""save"" Yugi in true Tenchi style.

It's a very different story than we got used to in the two earlier Tenchi series, but for me, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.  The animation isn't as good, true, but the story is solid and captivating as it explores the strengths and weaknesses of all the familiar, beloved Tenchi characters.",1174953600,,2123,4.526178010471204
7887021,1,6305241155,"To all those who are reading the reviews for this awful series, I'm hear to tell you they are correct!  I'm am an avid Tenchi fan and own the Tenchi Muyo OVA and Tenchi Universe box sets and have watched both series several times they are that good of Anime. I could not believe what I got myself into when I watched this mess with Tenchi in the title.  I thank God that I watched Tenchi in Tokyo when it was on Cartoon Network when I was a kid and not waste good money on it (breath of relief).  I thought I was missing something back then, but now that I am older and still watch Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe, it is more evident to me how bad this series is.  But why is it so bad?!  The artwork is horrible, for example the characters' eyes are tiny lifeless pupils instead of the big, bright and shining irises they usually have.  The characters are completely different and unsympathetic including Princess Ayeka who is a character I have always loved and cared for, but is portrayed in Tenchi in Tokyo as a psychotic maniac.  However the most important factor is Tenchi himself who is vastly different acting as a cold, inept person towards his friends as if he does not want to have anything to do with them.  Watching the series I will never understand why Tenchi falls for the plain Sakuya, wanting to be with her instead of the colorful ladies in his life. To put it simply, there was never a moment in the entire series where I felt attached or cared what happened to her.  In truth I did not care about Tenchi or anybody in ""Tokyo"" at all unlike in Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe where you fall in love with the characters they become apart of your life.  In addition to the terrible treatment of the protagonist,  Tenchi in Tokyo had a very bland antagonist in the form of Yugi who never performs any of her mischief and instead sits back and allows her work to take control by itself.  This would be acceptable except she is used in this fashion for every episode stripping her of a real evil persona.  Yugi is far inferior when matched with the villains in T.M. and T.U.  I am grateful the story elements in Tenchi in Tokyo were changed and altered with no connection to the other two wonderful series.  The music again was a big minus grounding the look and feel of the show in the realm of a teen soap opera instead of the majestic scores that gave T.M and T.U a grand, epic universe. For those of you who are watching Tenchi for the first time avoid Tenchi in Tokyo and stay with Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe. I do not consider Tenchi in Tokyo a Tenchi series at all but a poorly executed anime.",1168214400,,2620,4.318367346938776
7887022,1,6305241155,"O-K!  I had to force myself to watch this series in its entirety before writing this review.  Now that I'm done, my opinion hasn't changed in the least.  This series is completely inane!  It has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  If I had begun my Tenchi experience with this series, I would never have stuck around for the others.  To those of you who did, well at least you are gifted with a bright side:  The other series only gets better.  So, don't give up on Tenchi just yet.

Even as a standalone feature and not compared to the other series, the art/animation is awful.  The musical accompaniment is just as bad.  What's with the Beverly Hill-Billy, ho-down, line-dancing music set to the closing credits and next episode previews?  For goodness sake, the boy's a shrine-keeper in training and the future Earth Guardian, not the new heir apparent to the Dukes of Hazard franchise.

Character development?  What character development?  Princess Ayeka seems like she belongs in the Batman's  Arkham Asylum.  And Sakuya?  ""Plank"" from Ed, Edd, and Eddie is more interesting.  The villains (not including Yugi) have absolutely no depth whatsoever.

As far as the plot and storyline, well, at least they can get a new ""reality"" show out of it:  When Good Plots Go Bad.  This exercise in futility was so frustrating.  Every time it looked like the story was going somewhere, absurdity and stupidity won the day.

Honestly, this series had great potential but, like so many other things, we'll never see it realized.  What a disappointment!",1130976000,,1542,4.883720930232558

Tenchi thought living in the country was getting boring so he decided to move to the city named Tokyo, their he will be trained to be his grandfather's successor as a shrine master. The girls hate that Tenchi is moving so thanks to Washu's her invention, the interdimensional tunnel it can lead the girls right into Tenchi's room in Tokyo. Tenchi meets a girl named Sakuya who is in his class.",1129852800,,649,4.453781512605042
7887024,4,6305241155,"The first episode starts with us watching as something vandalizes a series of shrines in the city of Tokyo and we meet Yugi.  Then we find ourselves at the Masaki household, where we learn that Tenchi is going to study for two years in Tokyo, so he can, one day, replace his grandfather as the shrine master.  The girls are, of course, very upset, but Tenchi is very firm on the plan and leaves for Tokyo.
While it seems like Tenchi and the girls might be serparated, in truth they are not, as Washu has invented a Inter-Dimensional Tunnel which would allow the girls to visit Tenchi ALL the time.
That COULD be a problem for Tenchi's social life, as the girls are jealous and dangerous.  So when he bumps into a cute classmate, Sakuya, he knows he is in deep trouble.
But the girls are not the only ones watching him.  Yugi is watching and will try all she can to split up the group.  This new life might not just be the end of the world for the alien girls, but maybe the end of the world FOR real!
While I gave this DVD only four points, I do enjoy the songs and I have a soft place in my heart for the third episode, ""Long Distance Lunacy"" which isn't just funny, but is also the first Tenchi cartoon I ever saw.",1087603200,,1216,4.17948717948718
