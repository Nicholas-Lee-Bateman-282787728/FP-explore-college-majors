4046586,4,B0030OJPO0,"I didn't have high hopes for the documentary Afghan Star, but I really enjoyed it. The story is simple - freed from the Taliban, Afghanis launch their own version of American Idol called Afghan Star. The show becomes a huge hit, with up to one-third of the population watching. More importantly, Afghanis' reactions to the show reveal much about their culture and about human nature.

The documentary focuses on four contestants - two men and two women. All four are interesting, decent people and the viewer cheers for them. Western viewers will probably be most interested in the plight of the women, who must contend with Afghanis' ""traditional"" attitudes about the proper role of women. One woman - Setara - sets of a firestorm of controversy by dancing and showing her hair during her one of her performances.

Afghan Star is both educational and entertaining. I recommend it.",1311811200,,881,4.945945945945946
4046587,5,B0030OJPO0,"Afghanistan has been associated with violence, extremism, war, and backwardness for the past 30 years.  This refreshing film shows Afghanistan in a new light. Based on the concept of American idol, producers of the Afghan TV station TOLO create a show where contestants from different regions of Afghanistan compete to become Afghanistan's top singer. The film reminds us that Afghans are not different than Americans in their passion for entertainment and competition.  Seeing Afghans from different provinces in a friendly competition gives hope to the idea that one day their nation will enjoy peace. Tension is created when a woman contestant gets so wrapped up in her music that she dances slightly on stage. This is one of the most positive films on Afghanistan I have had the pleasure to watch. Take a break from the daily headlines detailing the violence of the war and watch Afghan Star.",1284940800,,896,5.047297297297297
4046588,5,B0030OJPO0,"Is peace and some semblance of democracy possible in Afghanistan? Is there any value in American popular culture?

Filmmaker Havana Marking's startling documentary, ""Afghan Star,"" grapples with both Big Questions and---along the way---she shows us scenes we'd never imagine here in the U.S. The documentary covers the debut season of an Afghan network TV clone of ""American Idol."" You can chuckle at the quality of make-shift Afghan pop culture---such as it is after years of the Taliban and warfare. This new pop culture often is pretty basic stuff. Before one ""Afghan Star"" production, for example, the documentary cameras take us back stage to show the Afghan network-TV crew toggling together what looks like a jumbled pile of scrap electrical components they've found to run their lights and cameras.

But ... You'll sit there through the whole thing fascinated by the window it opens into this mountainous country where we've been at war for so many years. I came away from the film deeply worried for the future of women and young people in Afghanistan. But I also came away greatly encouraged at the bravery and creative spirit of these young men and women delivering ""Afghan Star"" into families' living rooms whether they own big Kabul homes---or they're wiring a makeshift aerial on the roof of a mud hut in the mountains.

Maybe Americans could learn a few things from the grassroots campaigning Afghans eagerly wage for their stars on this hit TV show! Unlike ""American Idol,"" there's very serious campaigning underway in Afghanistan. One reason is that the entertainers are chosen from across the country and represent many different ethnic groups. So Afghans from children to old men crisscross their regions, handing out simply made posters and handbills--urging Afghans to pick up their cell phones and vote for regional singers. It's amazing footage. Every American civics class should show ""Afghan Star"" to teach our youth something about the infectious power of democracy.

We're not alone in recommending it. The film already has received praise from Oprah, Jon Stewart and the Sundance film festival among others. Enjoy it with friends.",1270080000,4,2157,5.171919770773639

8386044,5,B0030OJPO0,"I'd have edited out the first five minutes, but then the rest of this film is perfect.

Depicting ""just"" a song contest, it shows us how far Afghanistan still has to go to join the family of man. It's a country where men, both young and old, declare a young woman should not dance on stage; in fact, should die for it. Dancing, let it be said, less energetically than by our grandmothers, while fully clothed, with only her hands and face showing her sinful skin. Allah be praised.

The cinematographer was brilliant. His camera went from the natural beauty of the mountains to the squalor of Kabul to rooms inside homes. Mere seconds in this film represent countless books about the tragedy that is Afghanistan.

Based on my assignment there, I have hope for Afghanistan and its people. One day the cancer of the Taliban will be excised. Women will regain their roles as, if not equals, then at least partners. Burkas, that perverse demonstration of male insecurity and female subjugation, will, except for museum exhibits, finally disappear.

""Afghan Star"" is probably not easy to find, but it's well worth looking for.",1439078400,,1121,4.7927461139896375
8386045,5,B0030OJPO0,"With wonderful touches like watching a little Afghan girl at home making her Caucasian Barbie doll sing Afghan pop music and wear a burka, Afghan Star is an intimate peek into the lives of people who haven't been allowed to sing or watch TV under Taliban rule for approximately 20 years, as they risk their lives to create their own version of American Idol.  It helped me better understand the different tribes and cultures within Afghanistan as they unified with music in a way they couldn't with guns and politics.  First person accounts of living under Taliban rule and Sharia law were very powerful.  Instead of feeling like a dry and hopeless news report, this was a (cautiously) hopeful celebration of freedom by people who aren't all that different from you or me.",1437264000,,772,4.7894736842105265
8386046,4,B0030OJPO0,"Initially I found it really fun to watch plus it confirmed my preconception that most people are pretty much the same no matter where they come from.  The quality of the acts was much less than that of the American brand but their enthusiasm was infectious.  I was really getting a kick out of this documentary, until a woman contestant defied tradition.  And the results wiped the smile off of my face immediately.  As much as I would like for it not to be so, there are very serious differences between our societies, and very serious consequences to defying traditions in some of these third world countries.",1369440000,,611,4.682242990654205
8386047,3,B0030OJPO0,"I am pleased with the condition and fast delivery of this DVD but the I was expecting more from the story. Somehow, it was more dramatized I don't understand the significance of her struggle. .",1368489600,,193,4.542857142857143
8386048,5,B0030OJPO0,"I was interested in this film because I wanted to see a different side of Afghanistan besides the war-torn country seen in the news. This film presented a more relatable side to Afghanis through their enjoyment of pop music and the popularity of Afghan Star. I learned Afghanistan has different tribes and nations - such as Pashtuns, Hazara etc. I learned that when the Taliban ruled, dancing, music, and TVs were banned. During that time, men could not shave their beards or comb their hair.

I can see Afghanistan is still a very conservative country. Poor Setara, her life is in danger just because she uncovered her hair a little bit and danced to music!

This is a good film. I like their music ~ the secret of my heart is coming ~

How come some of the Afghans can speak good English? I thought the education system was lacking there.",1347062400,,840,4.549668874172186
8386049,5,B0030OJPO0,"This movie provides a good reason why the US should not leave Afghanistan before getting the country organized - at least to the point of controlling the Taliban. Yes, its not really a U.S. problem with what goes on in Afghanistan but who else is going to come along and help the Afghan people if not the U.S.A.?

The Afghan people are a strong bunch who have survived way too many years of wars. A lot of their hardship could have been avoided if foreign powers had not meddled so much with the country and used it as a battlefield for a proxy-war.

This film shows us how the Afghan people want music and desperately wish to express themselves democratically. The bravery of women participating the Afghan Star contest is astounding. In a country where people think its o.k. to kill a woman just because she danced a bit on a stage, I found this movie remarkable.

The film is very honest, shows us exactly how life is in Afghanistan and is very accurate in expressing the feelings of its people towards this new 'American Idol' type contest.

Just a few decades ago, Afghanistan was a not-so-bad place. A lot of Western backpackers used to go there...",1333497600,,1154,4.5603864734299515
