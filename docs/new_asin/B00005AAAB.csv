1412492,5,B00005AAAB,"Jancis Robinson has achieved what so few people do in the wine world; write about the wine with poise, humour and grace as well as educate and inspire.  The descriptions are fantastic, the music is lovely and the views  are absolutely breathtaking.  From cork to barrels to grapes, she touches  on each aspect of winemaking and how they influence the flavour.  She takes  you on a tour of all the classic winegrowing regions as well as the new  upstarts.  The winemakers are all prodded and interviewed gently for their  woes and joys in making what, in Robinson's mind and mine, a nectar of the  gods.
I first saw this video a year ago as a BBC publication in  Australia so I can't remember all the details to comment on them.  However,  the ones I do remember I wouldn't want to ruin it for people.  See the  video, it's fun.",912384000,12,827,4.456375838926174
1412533,5,B00005AAAB,"This is a great introductory over view of wine regions. It has fun quizzes on the special features, as well as maps and links and wine recomendations. Its fun.",1194307200,,159,4.517241379310345
1412534,5,B00005AAAB,"I absolutely loved this video series. It is very well done for a novice or more experienced wine lover. Jancis Robinson's very reserved, yet witty sense of humor and passion for the world of wine is a wonderful complement to her thorough knowledge of the subject matter. I would recommend this wine course to anyone looking to expand their knowledge on the subject.",1172016000,,365,4.809523809523809
1412535,5,B00005AAAB,"Excellent well rounded presentation , stunning photography and of course, great wines all presented by a knowledgable entertaining wine lover, Jancis.",1127606400,7,150,6.190476190476191
1412536,2,B00005AAAB,"I checked this course out of my local library, and suggest you do the same.  It is marginally about wine, and a lot about the effects of globalization on the wine industry.  Interesting, but if you want more than cursory insights on taste, and wine making technique, keep looking.

I am glad I watched it, make no mistake about that.  Highlighting the differences between national winemaking styles alone is well worth the time.  Interestingly though, I can't recall that it included discussion of the 1976 'Judgement of Paris' winetasting and its consequences.

I found Jancis a bit annoying after awhile.  The British have a well-honed ability to be condescending towards others, while having no native ability of their own.  She has the unremarkable ability to drink wine.  How that translated into something of celebrity status is a story of its own.  None of it translates in actual ability to create good wine.  Perhaps a little more humility on that lack would have reduced the gossip and catty comments.",1109721600,20,1011,4.958333333333333
1412537,5,B00005AAAB,"This is one of the most interesting DVD's I have ever viewed.  I love wine and now have a whole new outlook on the various wines of the world.  I will never look at wine the same again, only now with much more pleasure to be had.  Thank you Jancis for doing such a great job and for visiting such a variety of wonderful and beautiful places.",1102291200,5,341,4.059701492537314
1412538,1,B00005AAAB,"This video set is not necessarily a ""course"" about wine. This video compilation is more about Jancis Robinson crusading all over the world being seen with all these important vineyard owners. These videos are not for those who have moderate or less knowledge of wine and there seems to be nothing of substance for those who are trying to figure out why Chardonnay's, Cabernet's, etc...are the way they are. The information that is given is often vague and the dialogue is hard to follow. In the strictness sense, its a waste of money.",1024272000,29,534,4.752688172043011
1412539,5,B00005AAAB,"This DVD series comes in a box set of 5 DVD's (2 series per DVD).  The first DVD is an introduction to wine, with the second program being about the grape variety Chardonnay.  DVD 2 is about Cabernet Sauvignon, and Sauvignon Blanc.  DVD 3 Syrah/Shiraz, and Riesling.  DVD 4 is about Pinot Noir, and Merlot.  DVD 5 is about fizz, and grape invaders.
I first saw this BBC series on TV Ontario, a few years ago, and since I missed a few programs I decided to buy the series on DVD.  I'm glad I did.  Jancis takes a sensible view of wine, and wine tasting.  This program is not for wine snobs, but for those people who want to know how to understand and appreciate wine in general.  If you know how to taste a wine, then you'll know how to enjoy what appeals to your own taste buds, and not what you think you should like based on intimidations from others.  You can also tell if someone tasting a wine knows what they are doing from the way they smell, and taste the wine to the way they hold the glass.  Likewise if you order a wine in a good restaurant it helps to know if they are serving it correctly (in an appropriate glass, and at the right temperature), else they shouldn't be charging high prices for a product they don't know how to serve.
I always liked Julia Child because she taught the viewer the science of cooking.  Jancis's Robinson does the same thing.  She shows you the science of wine, and how it's made.  I particularly like the program on fizz.  It opened my mind to sparkling wines from other regions of the world other than France and champagne... especially since the series revealed that many of these sparkling wines from around the world are being produced with French methods by French companies.
Is it necessary to let a wine breath?  What does corked mean?  Jancis answers these questions.  I also found it surprising to know that most wines should be drunk when they are young.  Only a few wines need to be aged.
I've seen wine tasters appear on tv shows (Eg:  Martha Stewart).  They taste wines and ramble on about how good it is etc etc.  However none of these experts show people what to look for when tasting.  They don't show you how important the sinuses are in tasting.  It's all fine and dandy to watch Martha Stewart look at the experts and agree that the wine they just tasted is excellent.  They however neglect to show you how to do it yourself, and fine out what you consider to be excellent according to your own likes and dislikes.  Jancis does show you in this series.  Wine tasting is a personal thing... what one taster likes another dislikes.
Since watching the series I've decided to try Australian, New Zealand, and Chilean wines.  I'm glad I did.  Jancis is not afraid to place wines from these new wine countries, up against the best that Western Europe can offer.  Jancis has opened my mind to wine.  I recommend this series to anyone that seriously wants to learn how to consume wine.  It's also handy to have Jancis Robinson's book as well ""Jancis Robinson's Wine Course"" BBC Books ISBN 0-563-37098-X.",1012608000,73,3057,4.462093862815885
1412540,5,B00005AAAB,"I seldom score five stars, as most productions could be improved.  But, Robinson's 5 videos--and I strongly recommend viewing all five--satisfy all the requirements of its mission; i.e., to introduce the novice to the  history, culture, perspective and art of wine production and enjoyment.  One cannot learn everything about wine from these or any videos; that is  patently impossible.  Rather, they provide a foundation from which one can  develop an appreciation and understanding of the influence of and enjoyment  to be derived from this subject.
If you believe that wine is merely a  form of booze or a great marketing effort by the French or France and  California are the only regions producing great wine or worse--e.g.,  believe the Fed's labels that moderate consumption of wine is deleterious  to one's health--watch and listen to Jancis for five hours.  You will  travel the planet; explore wine from its roots to the noses of its most  sophisticated artisans; better understand why wine consumption has  decreased in France, while its best vineyards charge hundreds for a single  bottle; why wine can improve with age; and--some would argue--why without  terroir (roughly, the soul of the soil) a wine cannot be truly great.",948067200,13,1238,5.171717171717172

7935115,3,B00005AAAB,Her course talks about different country's and what they are doing. I had been looking for a more technical course that breaks things down. I felt the course was good for general knowledge but not much on in dept detail. I obtained more info from a quickstudy.com 4 page guide called Wine Buying & Tasting Guide.,1433462400,,312,4.589285714285714
7935116,1,B00005AAAB,I wish I had known how un-updated this material was. I didn't expect that from Mrs Robinson and because of the price I paid. NO RECOMMENDED AT ALL.,1431820800,,147,4.285714285714286
7935117,3,B00005AAAB,This DVD is seriously outdated for the person studying wine at a professional level. Some of the interviews with winemakers are embarrassingly old.,1321401600,2,147,5.434782608695652
7935118,5,B00005AAAB,"I recently starting studying for my WSET wine courses and have found these DVD's so useful. Packed with really useful information they are a great accompaniment to the book of the same name.

I'd recommend them to anyone with an interest in wine.

It would be nice if she brought out some more.",1253232000,,294,4.528301886792453
7935119,5,B00005AAAB,"Excellent DVD to learn on wine. Clear views, and nice videos on locations, that makes this DVD worth buying.",1250726400,,108,4.7368421052631575
7935120,4,B00005AAAB,"I really enjoyed the dvds, and it was a good education on the kinds of grapes out there, basics of wine production, and the wine industry world wide.  This will give you a little something when you are wondering what wines to buy or try.  But it does not tell you about wine tasting (the method or the description words ie. spicy, fruity, etc) which was a large part of why I got the dvds.  She just tells you ""everyone has a different palate"" and moves on. Oh, also, the thing is quite old (circa 1994-5 I'm guessing) Otherwise it was a great primer on the world of wine.",1235088000,2,572,4.229357798165138
7935121,3,B00005AAAB,"Good content. Explained nicely about 5 wine varieties. It's a good course for a beginner. It will increase the vocabulary and knowledge for sure!

However, the DVD quality is terrible. It looks as if the producers ran an old VHS tape and captured it on a DVD.",1228953600,4,259,4.51063829787234
7935122,3,B00005AAAB,An excellent series (BBC. Jancis Robinson brings a certain wit & British charm to the whole subject. She has an amazing ability to stand outside of the wine hype and almost view it as an outsider. The only thing is this: this series has a 1995 copyright. And a lot has happened in 13 years!,1202860800,9,290,4.290909090909091
7935123,1,B00005AAAB,"I've tried desperately to watch this DVD on several occasions only to find myself bored by the tiresome ramblings of Jancis R. I wasn't as convinced this DVD was about wine as it was about her seeing how long
she could talk. Hoping at any point she might get as tired of hearing her own voice as I was of hearing it.
Thank goodness I didn't buy this dvd. I've rented it a couple times hoping to find some little nugget that might
interest me. No such luck. At this point, not only would I NOT buy this DVD set, I wouldn't want it if it
were given to me. And the chance of me renting again is pretty close to non-existent. And if there were
an option for giving this DVD a zero star rating, that's still more than it deserves.",1198281600,4,725,4.112676056338028
