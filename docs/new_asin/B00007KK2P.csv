7977716,2,B00007KK2P,"Magda Konopka is a scarred and old hag who gets her hands on a drug that turns her young and booootiful. The drugs wears off and she constantly needs to seek more leaving death and deceit in her wake. I was totally unprepared to how horrible this movie is. Don't get me wrong - i expected a cheesy and campy film, but trust me when I say it isn't. In one or two scenes we get a glimpse of what this could have been (the strip scene), but on the overall this is nothing but a really bad movie and the little campy stuff there is does not make up for it. If you want a euro-criminal movie with the kind of comic and overdone elements this sort of outing needs go for Danger: Diabolik instead. Now, that is a good movie!",1122854400,3,717,4.056338028169014
7977717,5,B00007KK2P,"Magda Konopka plays a scarred female guinea pig who finagles a youth rejeuvenating drug that turns her into a ravishing Pam Anderson-lookalike stripper. She romances the ugliest Spanish gigolos ever filmed and then disposes of them (well, why not?).
The sets and outfits are 70's mod/Vogue Magazine eurotrash at it's gaudiest and foxiest. Konopka is a eurohottie and the fact that she never became a big star is a super question mark.",1045526400,15,434,5.041666666666667
