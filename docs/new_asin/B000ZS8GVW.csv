3043479,5,B000ZS8GVW,This was a very delightful story and quite thought provoking for my grandchildren in that they had to try to figure out a mystery.  Comical and yet a story that could happen in true life.,1353715200,2,187,4.3428571428571425
3043480,4,B000ZS8GVW,"Roxy Hunter and the Mystery of the Moody Ghost is my second favorite Roxy Hunter movie (the first being the Myth of the Mermaid movie). It's awesome. Roxy Hunter is a normal 11-year-old girl who likes to play super sleuth and solve mysteries. She and her family just moved from New Jersey to a small town called Serenity Falls into the Moody Mansion. Legend has it that the mansion is haunted by athe ghost of Estelle Moody. As Roxy uncovers the clues and solves the case, she becomes friends with a crow that she believes is the spiritual incarnation of Estelle. However, she finds out that Estelle Moody is actually still alive near the end and that the crow is really the spiritual incarnation of Estelle's deceased boyfriend named Theodore Corethers. Alongside that case, she finds out that the real estate agent Rebecca is trying to run them out of their house to build a subdivision and will stop at nothing to get it, even if it means putting Roxy's 12-year-old friend Max's life at stake.

Roxy is as cute as a button, but is also quite a sassy pants and gets in trouble a lot. She is out passed curfew and at one point, unknowingly breaks the law. She also believes that her 12-year-old friend Max is her fianc. Despite all of this, the Roxy Hunter franchise is one of my favorite movie franchises. Buy it. You won't regret it.",1350000000,,1336,4.54356846473029
3043481,5,B000ZS8GVW,"My Grandkids find it quite enjoyable. They watch the video at least once each week, have memorized much of the dialog. One small problem, at least on my car DVD player: with each interruption lasting more than an hour, the DVD starts over, rather than continuing from where it was paused.",1330300800,,288,4.666666666666667
3043482,1,B000ZS8GVW,"I suppose Roxy is meant to be sassy and precocious, but she just comes off as being bratty and in need of a lot of time out in her room.  She repeatedly mouths off to adults, breaks laws, and never obeys any rules her mother does try to set.  She's rude and inconsiderate to her family members.  Not at all a good role model.

The movie is watchable.  The actress playing Roxy is cute as a button.  Some of the sets are very good.  The mansion Roxy lives in is fascinating, although you do have to wonder how her mother can afford it on a bank teller's salary.  There is also a gorgeous library, which is unfortunately run by a very stereotypical nerdy librarian.  A lot of the characters are one dimensional stereotypes--the crabby bank lady, for instance.  Small town life is depicted like something out of the 1950s.  Neither the bank or the library has computers.

The plot is rather thin and doesn't really add up.  Roxy's great detective skills are just coincidences and wild guesses that always just happen to be right.

I'd pass on this one.  It isn't wretched, but with Roxy's behavior problems, why bother with a so-so plot.",1233619200,4,1134,4.517241379310345
3043483,4,B000ZS8GVW,"First off, this is a movie for young tween-age girls.  A MOVIE.  If you are frightened that your child will have a personality over-haul from watching a 90 minute fictional movie, then perhaps you had best skip it.

That being said, my 8.5 yo daughter liked the movie, liked the plot, and liked that the lead character showed independence and spirit.  She questioned things, was intelligent, and yes, had a bit of an attitude.  What girl does not?  It was a nice movie, moved quickly, no real scarey things,and a nice ending.  Very family appropriate!",1216166400,3,551,4.7368421052631575

.......................................................................................................................................................................................
....................................................................................................................................................................................... Roxy Hunter & The Mystery of the Moody Ghost aired today on Nickelodeon. Roxy is an obnoxious little girl with a bland, passive sidekick (friend who is staying with them because his parents are very ""absent"".) Her mom is overly perky and passive with an overly perky love interest at her work. This plot is seriously lacking. Roxy, continually spouting nonsense and her obnoxious mouth, was an immediate turn-off. She's rude, demanding, picks fights and has far too much attitude, not only for a little girl, but for anyone. I think they attempted to show her as smart and bold but it comes off horribly. Not a good role-model for children. Not only that, but the ""plot"" involves lying to her mother, threatening to run away when grounded (grounded, yeah right, she sneaks away again and steals files from the local bank), hiding a grown man in their attic, kidnapping, locking a child in a crypt, and travelling with strangers in their cars. Three bright spots were the creepy, overly-intelligent librarian... he was well cast,  the comedic presence of the man from the attic and Roxy's kindness to the elderly ""Miss Moody"". Overall, poor acting, poor plot and a poor choice for family entertainment.",1200787200,6,1630,6.616822429906542
