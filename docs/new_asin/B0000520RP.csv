Copeland book on ""Bill Elliott:The Peaceable Man"" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action. My personal favorites were the ""Red Ryder Series"" or ""The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok"" an ongoing character that would appear in many films to come...as Hickok and Wild Bill Saunders. Elliott was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were the caliber of Buck Jones, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele...good reading for all you wranglers out there...I found myself being transported back in time, Mr. Copeland's book has opened my eyes to what a wonderful unselfish person Bill Elliott was...only wish I could have met him. He was one of a kind...a peaceable man!...published by Empire Publising and available on Amazon and Empire Publications Inc.

If you enjoyed this volume the other volumes will have you roped and hogtide ... the Red Ryder Double Feature Series is a must have for all of us who grew up riding the trails with Fred Harman's newspaper comic strip character which was popular during 1936 to 1964 --- during that time I discovered Dell Comics and the stories and artwork of Harman's hero Red Ryder --- now on DVD we can relive those early days when Red Ryder, Little Beaver and the Duchess made the west a safe place live --- B-Westerns reigned for all the little cowboys and girls who made a trip to the local theater to watch their favorite hero Red Ryder!
