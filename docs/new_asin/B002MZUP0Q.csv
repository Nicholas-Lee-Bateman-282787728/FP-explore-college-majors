8374326,5,B002MZUP0Q,I'm watching shaolin vs ninja from this pack and it's the full version with excellent dubbing. Other versions of this movie are cut and have their own audio track which is terrible. Otherwise this pack is worth it just for this movie. I might update my review when I see the rest.,1478217600,,280,4.403846153846154
8374327,3,B002MZUP0Q,"If you're thinking of buying this DVD because you want the Shaw Brothers film ""Shaolin Temple"" (aka ""Death Chamber"") from 1976, directed by Chang Che, and starring Ti Lung and David Chiang, STOP. This isn't that film! It's also not the 1983 film ""The Shaolin Temple"" starring Jet Li. This is a 1978 film of the same name directed by Tong Sang and starring Shu Feng, Lam Kwong Jung, Chia Ling, and others. Also, it is not a Shaw Brothers feature. Yes, the lettering on the DVD cover may lead you to believe otherwise but this is neither the Chang Che nor Jet Li version. It is this one:

[...]

To be honest, it's not a half-bad film -- it's got some good fighting and a cool series of duels in a 7-level pagoda at the end. However, I was interested Chang Che's ""Shaolin Temple"" and was extremely disappointed to discover this error. And I do believe it's an honest error. These movies are very obscure, some aren't even cataloged in IMDB, and they're being distributed by smalltime operators. Just a mix up.

That's not all the bad news. You might be purchasing this double-feature DVD thinking you're getting another Shaw Brothers film called ""Shaolin vs. Ninja"" (aka ""Heroes of the East,"" ""Shaolin Challenges Ninja"") from 1978 and directed by Lau Kar Leung and starring Gordon Liu. Wrong again. This film is called ""Shaolin vs. Ninja"" but it is not a Shaw Brothers film. It was directed by Jmai Chen Jsai and stars Alexander Lou. You can see it here:

[...]

Once again, this is not a terrible film -- it's got lots of ninjas, and toward the end there is a series of set-piece matches between Japanese fighters and Shaolin monks. Alexander Lou is good as always. Just be warned this is not a Shaw Brothers flick and it's not the more famous movie with this title.

In terms of film quality, neither of these films are not great to look at -- non-restored film in 1.33:1 ""TV size"" aspect ratio. The colors and sound are awful and it's English dubbed only. No special features, and both movies are on one DVD. This is definitely nothing like a Celestial Pictures/Dragon Dynasty release, but I doubt these two films are available in any better form.

If you want the more well-known film ""Shaolin vs. Ninja,"" it's available from Dragon Dynasty (DVD #28). You can't get the Chang Che version of ""Shaolin Temple"" from Dragon Dynasty, unfortunately, even though it's one of his greatest movies. You can get it on Region 3 DVD distributed by Bonzai Media. That's what I did and it's a decent (thought very basic) DVD version.",1373068800,,2520,4.599109131403118
