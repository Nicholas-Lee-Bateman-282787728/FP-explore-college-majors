8237667,5,B0010DM49G,Love the artbox! This is Vol. 2 of the wallflower series. It contains episodes 6 - 9 and extras that include clean opening and closing animation. This volume features a Halloween episode and it is fun and hilarious. This series is very addicting! If you want to watch an anime that brightens up your day.. this is the anime to watch!,1323475200,,333,4.475409836065574
8237668,4,B0010DM49G,"The comedy in this volume had me chuckling throughout but it wasn't until the final episode of the volume that I really caught myself laughing out loud at the jokes. The characters remain strong though and while the story is taking a bit too really get moving, the series has kept me entertained enough to want to see more. Like right now. If you're looking for a good comedy series, this is one that you'll want to make sure gets added to your watch list.",1215475200,,456,4.376470588235295
