6877632,5,B00QRBBSH0,"this series deserves a continuation!!! Tom Ellis is breathtaking as Dr.  Rush. The progression to redemption and sacrifice is heartwrenching.  While I doubt he could pull off both series (and Lucifer) together, this is something Ellis needs to return to and bring to fruition. Storytelling is that good.",1481587200,2,303,5.291666666666667
6877633,5,B00QRBBSH0,Great show!,1480636800,,11,5.0
6877634,5,B00QRBBSH0,Really liked watching this years' Lucifer TV series and thought I'd give this a try.  It was very good.  Too bad it only lasted for 10 episodes...it deserved better than that.,1473379200,,175,4.612903225806452
6877635,5,B00QRBBSH0,"Miss this show, wish I had Bill Gate money cause I would bring it back.  Loved the shows ability to take a doctor and give him an unusual twist!",1469145600,3,144,3.9655172413793105
6877636,5,B00QRBBSH0,Like watching a movie all most. Loved the show. Wished it hadn't been canceled but now we have Lucifer which is a great show.,1468886400,3,125,4.25
6877637,5,B00QRBBSH0,Rush is a brilliant series.,1467676800,,27,4.6
6877638,4,B00QRBBSH0,"The series circles around dr. Rush, a capable but drug addicted MD who works independently for mostly shady people who pay well. Tom Ellis portrays this character in a believable and sympathetic way and makes the best out of the script. Dr. Rushes flaws and addiction make you want to shake him at times  however there is this other side to him, that brings out the human and fragile aspects. Even though the show runs with the medical topic, I found the idea of a freelancing doctor, bringing it out of the hospital, interesting. Allas the first and only season ends with ONLY cliffhangers for all the main characters and leaves the audience wanting. I think the writers could have rounded it up in a more satisfying way. If you like Tom Ellis and this series: check out his new gig: Lucifer!",1465603200,14,793,4.584507042253521
6877639,5,B00QRBBSH0,Loved this from start to finish! Wish it had a second season to resolve the plot lines left in the air! About five minutes in you totally forget any other character you've seen Tom Ellis portray - which is to me the hallmark of a superb actor.,1464393600,6,243,4.191489361702128
6877640,5,B00QRBBSH0,Excellent!!! A pity that the serie didn't get a season 2...,1464134400,,59,4.454545454545454

6877644,5,B00QRBBSH0,"I really liked this show.  I was very disappointed when it got canceled. However,  Tom Ellis has a new show (but I found out he was also on a BBC show called Miranda which is HILARIOUS) so I still get to see him.
