8544899,5,B009XC8QWU,"This film is personal to me because my brother was in the 101st Airborne and was called to Ole Miss during the riot. President  Kennedy needed to intervene and this was a turning point in American history, and the ghosts are still lingering in Oxford.  I love the film, in that it was created by a Mississippi writer, who tells the story from his perspective, and the integration of the football season makes it extraordinary.",1394064000,,426,4.666666666666667

We've  come a long way since those terrible times.  Ole Miss football probably can be credited for saving this wonderful University.  Can't wait to go to The Grove for football this year.
