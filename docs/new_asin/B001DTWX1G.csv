3540240,1,B001DTWX1G,"I sat through this expecting a surprise along the way. What a sad joke. This movie will either put you to sleep or give you nightmares about why you wasted an hour and a half of your life. It's a low budget, over acted bomb with no logical plot. You've been warned. I wish I could give it a lower rating.",1227052800,4,304,4.0
3540241,3,B001DTWX1G,"Lame ripoff of several post apocalypse stories.  I saw elements of ""Children of Men"", ""Mad Max"", and ""The Day After"", along with a bunch of forgettable copycat movies usually seen at 2AM on TV, or in the $5 bin at Walmart.  It could've been done much better, but it didn't seem like anybody really had their heart in making it.",1226793600,3,327,4.433333333333334
3540242,4,B001DTWX1G,"So I have been playing the game Fallout 3 for the XBOX 360 and I was kinda into that nuclear fallout thing so I picked this movie up because I thought it looked cool

well it is cool and I would say it is a must see

there are some unexplained things one in particular - this is NOT a spoiler of any kind - there is this part where you see someone put something into someones arm like where a needle would go but it is like a big pointed thingie, well later on the same person comes across a dead body and pulls what looks like the same thing out of that guys arm, not sure what this is - and then theres this black dude with a puppet who makes you see the past or something but other than that and the lack of a pre-story sorta like when the bombs fell it is a great movie that must be seen",1225756800,3,791,3.817073170731707
3540243,4,B001DTWX1G,"I was hoping to bank in on the horrid cover and back panel as I picked this guy up off the shelves of my local Blockbuster. However, I discovered after about 45 seconds of viewing that this was not going to be a shlock-fest as I'd hoped. However, it did turn into a wonderfully enchanting independent film about a group of people making sense of themselves and of a world that has fallen to pieces around them. The backgrounds of the main characters are slowly unveiled while their journey pushes them forward, following the only thing they can; the voices they hear over radio waves.

Again, don't be fooled into thinking that 20 YEARS LATER (should be titled Like Moles, Like Rats) or the tag-line of 'AFTER THE BOMBS. AFTER THE PLAGUES. BEFORE THE UNKNOWN' has anything to do with the movie. It's not Planet of the Apes, it's not Soylent Green, it's not I Am Legend, and it's not Children of Men.

Some serious time and love has been put into this film, and it deserves respect.",1223683200,50,981,4.50561797752809
3540244,5,B001DTWX1G,"A great flick!

3540245,1,B001DTWX1G,"The only reason it gets any stars at all is because it was filmed in Huntsville Alabama, particularly in Three Caves, which is a really cool place.  Unfortunately this isn't enough by itself to overcome the film's many flaws.

The plot isn't super original, but it's decent.  The storyline in the second half gets a bit disconnected and lost.  Compared to The Road, it lacks the credibility, plausibility, and desperation.  Characters this helpless would not still be around after 20 years of lawlessness and anarchy.  On the contrary, they'd be the first victims.

The acting is hammed up quite a bit and the mystical traveling man who, as one of the main good guy characters you're presumably supposed to be rooting for, is creepy as hell.  Creepy and freaky seem to be common threads with a lot of the characters. The main protagonist is a worthless, uninteresting, dime-a-dozen suburban kid whose only useful skill is broadcasting old records and nostalgic, emo gab over the radio.  Never mind using the Ham radio to help separated family members find each other or to barter for fuel, medical supplies, etc.; let's use up the fuel in the generator to tie up the airwaves with music.

Then there are the costumes and props, most of which look like they were bought the day before at K-Mart and are so clean and fresh they shouldn't even have bothered taking the tags off. (This IS a post-apocalyptic film that takes place--as you may have guessed by the title--twenty years after.)  It is also apparent that 20 years after an apocalypse cigarettes will be as commonly found as rocks and gravel.

On a more positive note, the CG FX were decent.  Not up there with Avatar or the Matrix, but very good for a low budget film.",1403913600,2,1725,4.71
3540246,4,B001DTWX1G,THIS WAS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR A READ BUT IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF THE CLASSICS.,1382918400,,107,3.5
3540247,4,B001DTWX1G,"I was surprised this film had such bad ratings on IMDb and rotten tomatoes - I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had no expectations before hand, I was just glad to find a post apocalyptic film that didn't have zombies in it. It reminded me of watching my wife play the Fallout video games.

I would describe this film as a slice of life in an alternative post apocalyptic world. There is some mysticism, which may have alienated viewers. I don't think there is any underlying message about man kind. The characters are entertaining, and it's not overly gruesome. It's low budget, but not in a campy sort of way.",1378684800,3,603,4.532110091743119
3540248,4,B001DTWX1G,"Not a bad low budget post apocalyptic movie. I enjoyed it especially because it was filmed in and around Huntsville, Alabama and I recognized a lot of the areas where it was filmed. Yes, I live in Huntsville. FYI, if you're interested other movies filmed here they include: The Ravagers (1979) with Richard Harris, Ernest Borgnine, Art Carney - Space Camp (1986) with Kate Capshaw, Lea Thompson, Kelly Preston - What Waits Below (1983) British production with Timothy Bottoms - Beyond The Stars (1989) with Martin Sheen, Christian Slater, Sharon Stone - Tom and Huck (1995) Disney production with Jonathan Taylor Thomas (Home Improvement television series), Brad Renfro - Constellation (2005) Billy Dee Williams, Zoe Saldana, Leslie Anne Warren, Rae Dawn Chong - A Smile As Big As The Moon (2010) Hallmark Hall of Fame movie with John Corbett - Space Warriors (2013) Hallmark Hall of Fame movie with Dermont Mulroney, Mira Sorvino, Danny Glover - and if you're into Star Trek, the Star Trek 30th Anniversay; One Weekend on Earth was held in Huntsville with all of the origonal cast memebers present as well as many stars of the later television series and Star Trek Enterprise actor, John Billingsley (Dr. Phlox) attended Grissom High School for a time.",1376956800,,1253,5.0
3540249,1,B001DTWX1G,"Too difficult to explain how bad it is. I bought it in spite of the bad reviews because my taste in movies is so different from other people, but I have to say they were right.

3540256,1,B001DTWX1G,"I should have known better after reading the back of this DVD I rented at Blockbuster than to rent it. My hopes that I would be wrong were dashed when I found out this movie is just another poor attempt by bankrupt movie makers to cash in on popular box office hits. Dedicated end-of-times enthusiasts may take this poorly written prediction of the future to heart but, of course, some people will believe anything. Low budget movies like this have the advantage of being filmed in a junk yard.",1256774400,3,494,4.561797752808989

3540258,1,B001DTWX1G,"I love post apocalyptic sci-fi movies. Since I am partial to that breed of movie I am willing to forgive a lot. But this movie fails in just about every way a movie can fail. The story is weak, the acting is weak....EVERYTHING is weak. Some movies are so bad (e.g. Plan 9 From Outer Space) that they are entertaining as comedies. Not so here. Just really bad.  I found myself thinking about WORK while watching this. That is how gripping it is. Imagine a bunch of high school film students made a budget movie for their class project. Well, here it is. I am gonna take this one to 1/2 Price Books asap.",1246060800,3,602,4.280701754385965
3540259,1,B001DTWX1G,"Zillions of logical flaws--people are way too clean, trimmed, and civil.  Mostly, they're just too plump--are supplies running low or not?  Was there or was there not a nuclear cataclysm so great that it totally destroyed society and blighted agriculture, and if so...?

As the other reviewers have said, ""Post-Apocalyptic"" nearly requires the adjective ""bad"".  This is even worse than that. In addition to an absolutely nonsensical plot thread (and associated stock caricatures--insane sisters/adopted daughters of ""wicked witch"")we also have actual fairyland style magic with a psycho-mystic twist courtesy of a cheesy Black ""shaman"".  Imagine Lionel Richie blathering platitudes in Morgan Freeman's very blandest voice.

And for all that, Tara Nevins' rendition of ""Stars Fell on Alabama"" is worth the rental.",1241481600,12,812,5.669421487603306
3540260,1,B001DTWX1G,"If you have two brain cells to rub together you won't like this movie.  I like Azura Skye and I wanted to like this movie but it just didn't make a lick of sense:
-it seemed like the black guy said he lived in a basement under the basement?
-black guy has magical powers?
-seems like everyone has claimed their little square of land and pretending that they're the last ones left by not leaving their hiding place
-how did the crazy miss havisham-esque lady with wierd lips find out about the pregnant chick when the pregnant chick was hiding in a basement?
-the make it seem like such a huge journey when people leave one place for another and yet it seems like they make it to the next place with ease and just a few hours of walking
-how is it that one grp of people can make it to a place by walking in about the same amount of time as it takes another to drive when it was supposed to be an incredible journey? and how did they all know to go to the same place?
-what the hell is the corridor?
Those are just a few of the holes in the logic of this movie.
This was a very poorly told story with incredibly shoddy editing. You will have more fun watching white paint dry in low light.",1235865600,6,1188,4.098712446351931
3540261,4,B001DTWX1G,"I was expecting a bad horror movie but that's not what this movie is at all.  It's ultimately a sweet and hopeful movie about people trying to survive in a world that has been ravaged by war and disease.  There are a few plot points that didn't make a lot of sense to me but overall the acting and scenery were spot on.  The sets were realistic and the scenery was at moments serenely beautiful and at others desolate and lifeless.  I also have to comment on the soundtrack.  The music was wonderful.  If a CD was available, I would definitely buy it.  So, don't let the really bad cover scare you away from a real treat of a movie.",1233187200,6,632,4.216666666666667
3540262,1,B001DTWX1G,"Bad post-apocalyptic movies and pregnancies are very similar.  They're both slow, deliberate, and excruciating.  For pregnancy, there are drugs - legal drugs - that can dull the pain, and there are procedures that can speed the process.  For horrible movies without a real premise set after a nuclear war, there is no reprieve.

When resources are scarce, with water and food nowhere to be found, it's every man for himself.  When Samuel Singleton meets two women squatting in his house - Margaret and Sarah (eight months pregnant) - they decide to take a trip to a spring-fed lake in order to save their lives.  Along with a radio host named Michael, they meet up with a colony of survivors living in a system of caves.  From there it's a bunch of poorly done hocus-pocus amidst a poor attempt at some sort of pseudo&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/0790729342/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road Warrior</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raising-Arizona/dp/6305499128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raising Arizona</a>, as a character similar to Morgana from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Excalibur/dp/B000Q66JXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Excalibur</a>&nbsp;attempts to steal the only baby born in the last 15 years.

It's slow, disjointed, poorly acted, and tediously irritating.  The dartboard timing of the soundtrack borders on unnerving, like cats screeching while you're reading.  The transitions are abruptly inappropriate, like a cage match breaking out at a kindergarten.  The characters have a noxious combination of preposterous acting talent and the ability to elicit angered contempt from the audience.

The plot, characters, and situations are all loosely connected.  Like a drugged spider in a futile attempt to weave a web, there really is no chance at saving the movie or the viewer from the inevitable pain that is sure to be worse than child-birth.  It's just too bad there wasn't a second nuclear war about 15 minutes into this affront to cinema.",1230336000,17,2128,6.2184300341296925

3540264,5,B001DTWX1G,"I enjoyed this movie from start to finish.  Azura Skye portrayed her character well & had us empathetic with her struggle to survive & succeed. I found the acting by the doctor to be superb; his character was adoring, yet we were left with a tragic ending for him. The storyline was, nevertheless, excellent, and the directorial debut by Jim Torres was outstanding.  This is a well-made, scripted & directed movie for those who care to see a movie with good character development and a story that will be remembered because of the struggles experienced by these characters.",1228176000,13,573,4.836734693877551

8294899,1,B001DTWX1G,"I'm going to start this review with a review of the first three reviews in this list. The folks who wrote them are full of merde and they are trying to mislead you, my dear peoples. I suspect the folks who wrote them were either involved in the production or viewed the movie under the influence of a substance that makes bad movies seem wonderful. Ignore the positive reviews here because this movie AWFUL. BAD. Don't be mislead, and don't waste your time.

Pointless script, and horrible, confusing editing. It's like watching grass grow if watching grass grow made no sense. Awful, stilted high school drama department dialogue, incomplete backstory, and a plot that only made sense the mind of the director, and maybe the screenwriter (I don't think the let the editor in on the joke)? There are some decent performances here from some good actors, which is a real shame. Capable acting makes no difference if the script is a total turd, and wow is this script a turd. The plot leaves you scratching your head trying to figure out what you missed, but then you realize that you didn't miss anything; the movie just doesn't make a lot of sense. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of bad that makes you laugh out loud, like ""The Room"" or ""Birdemic"" both of which have value as comedy unintentional though it may be. It's the kind of bad that makes you want to do anything but watch the movie before you. It's a mess.
