I could have used a more satisfying ending, but that's just me I suppose. If your looking for an hour and a half of good clean fun, I think you'll find this movie charming, witty, and thoughtful. My reccomendation is to buy this film, if only to support his future endevours.",1396569600,,418,4.172839506172839
