516954,5,6302797675,Professional acting; brilliant writing. Pay special attention to underappreciated aspect of film: interior architecture to reflect the moral values of Bannion on one side and Lagana's world as personified by his henchman Stone (Lee Marvin) on the other. Note  that the only images in Bannion's home are of Christian crosses; first time we see Stone's penthouse apartment the dominating shadow in his living room is of a Swastika.,1475539200,6,429,5.3088235294117645

516998,5,6302797675,"As with any other film that is a ""true classic,"" I am always the last person to experience it.

It took me all these years to watch perhaps the greatest film noir release ever, The Big Heat.

What an amazing discovery this movie was for me. A bonafide, honest and tough crime drama with Glen Ford as a relentless detective who is investigating the suicidal death of a fellow police sergeant and suspects foul play. Lee Marvin and Gloria Grahame (who would go on to do OKLAHOMA two years later), are absolutely superb here as is the well-paced direction by the infamous Fritz Lange.

Had no idea the blonde who was rolling dice at the bar counter (and gets slapped) is none other than Carolyn Jones who would go on to play Morticia in ""The Addams Family."" Discovered that little piece of information after doing research on the cast.

The Encore Blu-ray Release from Twilight Time is exceptional. The Black and White transfer, while dreary in nature, is highly detailed with a good amount of film grain intact. If there were any dirt or specs in the print, they were minimal. This is another stellar presentation from the Columbia film library vaults courtesy of Twilight Time.

Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film for the very fist time. I can see why it is one of the most popular film noir releases. For anyone that has yet to see this film, it is an essential Blu-ray purchase. I can't see anyone disliking this film.",1458691200,,1422,4.626984126984127

Like many other old films, I wish it had been remastered and transferred better. It's a bit grainy, like many others, but it doesn't take away from how good the film is.

Extraordinarily brutal, as well... there are moments in this that can still shock sixty years later. Gloria Grahame is, as always, perfect. And while he doesn't have the cache of some other noir heroes, I could watch Glenn Ford talk tough and slap down mugs all day long. Some really sparkling dialog in this, as well.

Ford drives the plot with power and determined strength.  Grahame is delightful and even clever as the girl of a mob boss.  Their two lives are thrown together amidst the unfold drama when the pursuit of the mob boss becomes very personal for Ford.  As Noir films go, this is top shelf.  Lee Marvin has long held bad or tough guy roles.

Ford is a bit typecast as the rigid thinking  Detective with an angry cloud engulfing him,  but he lets  human side of the character work also. Gloria Grahame is never so beautiful as the  ditzy blonde who yet had a shred of character under her frivolous attitudes.  Lee Marvin was menacing and cruel, but even his character had depth.

Glenn Ford is excellent as the lead while Gloria Grahame gives a stellar turn as the woman caught up in man's ugly criminal world.  A young Lee Marvin also lends his acting skills as a thug who has a problem treating ladies with much respect.

Police Sergeant Bannion(Glenn Ford) starts out investigating the apparent suicide of a corrupt cop, but he is soon ordered to stop the investigation and leave well enough alone.  But of course, he won't be doing that and the ensuing events are shocking.  They build into a gripping climax worthy of at least one view.  But me, I think I've seen it five times already.

517105,5,6302797675,"The Big Heat (1953) is Fritz Lang's greatest achievement of the '50s. There are those (especially in France) who acclaim Moonfleet (1955), and it is possible to argue that his last urban thrillers (Beyond a Reasonable Doubt and While the City Sleeps - both 1956) are hugely under-rated, but The Big Heat is so obviously a great film noir that one is tempted to say it is indeed Lang's final masterpiece. Its greatness lies in the tight no-fat Sidney Boehm script which features barely a scene or line of dialogue which fails to develop a story which hurtles along at breakneck pace to deliver it's sophisticated revision of the noir genre with the full force of a gun in the gut. Take the film's opening for example. In the first 4 minutes all the main characters are introduced, the plot is initiated and developed, and the film's main theme of the exposure of corruption is telegraphed as clear as a bell. Lang achieves this by the brilliant use of the telephone. The first shot shows a gun on a desk (note the absence of any establishing shot). A hand picks it up. We hear the gunshot off-screen, the camera dollying back (a Lang trademark this) to reveal a man slumped dead over his desk, his police badge and a letter in front of him. Obviously this is the suicide of a crooked cop. Enter the wife (Jeanette Nolan) next to one of Lang's clocks showing the time to be 3:00 AM - yet another of Lang's destiny machines is up and running. Is the woman horrified? No, she is involved in the corruption. She reads the letter and picks up the phone. Does she call the cops? Again no. It is the henchman of mobster Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) who picks up and hands the receiver on to his boss. Lagana thanks Mrs. Duncan for the information and advises she now call the police. After hanging up Lagana orders his henchman to phone his chief heavy, Vince Stone (Lee Marvin). Again the phone is picked up by a minion, this time Stone's girlfriend, Debbie Marsh (Gloria Grahame). She passes on to Stone who is ordered to (it is strongly hinted) arrange the blackmail payments to Mrs Duncan to prevent the contents of that letter from ever being exposed. A flash of photo bulbs clears to reveal detective Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford), the hero-to-be of the rest of the film beginning his investigation into the suicide. Lang takes a mere 4 minutes to depict an entire world - a dirty world which amounts to a garbage can, the lid of which Bannion spends the rest of the film trying to lift off. The precise economic concision of Boehm and Lang's story-telling here is simply breath-taking.

Matching the incision of the narrative drive is the superb mise-en-scene which Lang deploys to delineate the differences between the corrupt immoral world of Lagana and the upright moral world of Bannion. Ingeniously, Lang paints immorality as a positive - Lagana's impressive mansion, the Duncans' well-appointed house, Vince's stylish penthouse suite and the chic jazz bar named 'The Retreat'. There's nothing menacing or sinister about any of these bright well-lit locations. Lang reserves seediness for the world of the honest people - the police bureau and especially Bannion's home. In the film corruption is seen as all-pervasive and because corruption is in place all the way up to the police commissioner (who plays poker with Stone!) Bannion's investigation amounts to a criminal activity which everyone wants to see quashed. In the world of the bad, it is a crime to be good - it's possible Lang thought he had captured the very essence of American society here! At any rate, the sophisticated facade of respectability does sucker in Bannion at first. It needs a dirty phone call to his wife and a bomb to really turn him into a rogue cop fighting against the system.

One of the many interesting things about the film is the fact that Lang was working from a script already in place and many of the key sequences were written by Boehm, not Lang. This means that many things are in the film which we don't find in other Lang films. The Bannion marriage (Jocelyn Brando - sister of Marlon - playing much better than many claim) is depicted as a warm positive - other Lang films show marriage to be anything but. Also the character of Bannion himself is an out-and-out hero who actually defeats the destiny machine (the organized crime depicted in the film) and leaves the film with society changed for the good. No other Lang 'hero' is so upright and morally 'clean'. There is a warmth to the picture which is absent from much of his other work. Note the way Bannion solves the investigation courtesy of people helping him (the old lady at the demolition yard, his old war buddies who protect his daughter, even his old partner and boss who eventually change their hearts) and there is a very real sense of a tragic man who has lost his life and his home (the sequence in his empty house), but who regains interest in life through the actions of a woman who yearns for the domestic joys which have always elluded her. The last scene of Debbie dying in Bannion's arms while he tells her about his wife is deeply moving in a sentimental manner rare in Lang.

And yet, master film-maker as Lang was, we have to acknowledge the extent to which he changed Boehm's script to something more starkly Langian. Most obvious is Lang's insertion of extra violence such as Stone stubbing the girl in the bar with his cigarette. Then there is the ending of the film which Lang completely re-wrote. Boehm originally had Lagana kill Mrs Duncan so that with Debbie free of guilt she was allowed a happy ending with wedding bells ringing in the distance for her and Bannion! Lang makes Bannion into a harder, colder character. One reading of the film would be that 'Bannion the rogue cop out to bring the system down' actually achieves nothing himself. He brings down Lagana by using Debbie instead. We musn't ignore Debbie's own motivation for shooting Mrs Duncan (which is clearly there in the script), but she is used by Bannion nevertheless. She dies in the process, as do all the women in the film who associate with Bannion. Something in Bannion seems to die along with his wife and every time a character tries to help him, he simply brushes them aside with some kind of acid comment (Debbie receives the brunt of this). The clincher for me is when he throws the gun on the bed for Debbie to (presumably) protect herself. Actually he is asking her (consciously? sub-consciously?) to go ahead and kill Mrs Duncan for him.

And let's not get carried away by the film's 'positive' ending. In the coda, life goes on at the police bureau meaning that 'the big heat' brought down by Bannion on organized crime hasn't entirely cleaned things up. Bannion's last action is to answer yet another phone call which might set everything up all over again, an added chaser being to order the coffee be kept heated up as he leaves - this in a film where we know exactly how dangerous that beverage can be!!

As you can tell, I think the film is a masterpiece - it never dulls with repeated viewings. The script and direction are so good that the acting just falls perfectly into place. Gloria Grahame has received most of the plaudits from the critics, but for me it is Glenn Ford who delivers the film's greatest performance. It's a masterpiece of non-performance in which the mechanics of the acting craft utterly disappear. The DVD itself is a model of its kind. Released by Columbia, the images are as crisp and as steely hard as one could wish for - a welcome change from the usual poor state of available transfers of Lang's other American films. Now if only Fury (1936), You Only Live Once (1937), Scarlet Street (1945), House by the River (1950) and The Blue Gardenia (1951) could receive the same treatment...",1411430400,,7787,4.64394488759971

I feel Glenn Ford And Gloria Grahame play their roles with good conviction. And Lee Marvin ,well has he ever put in a bad performance ?  Big Heat is about the honest but very tough cop standing up to corruption no matter what is takes.

517107,4,6302797675,"This atmospheric B&W film is directed by Fritz Lang. His best known early work was ""Metropolis"" (1927, German). In 1936 he headed to Hollywood. He had 19 American films under his belt before the ""The Big Heat"" (1953), and I think his film noir credentials are solid. I'm not a film noir collector, but I have a few of the classics, and ""The Big Heat"" usually makes people's Top 20 Film Noir lists.

Opening scene: A man sits at his desk. we see him from behind, he picks up a revolver and shots himself, collapsing onto his desk. Near his lifeless hand is a police badge and a sealed envelope addressed to the District Attorney.

Unfortunately, the first person on the scene is his surprisingly unsurprised wife. She opens the envelope and skims the handwritten pages it held. She will eventually call the police, but first she calls Mr. Mike Lagana, mob boss: ""Tell him it's Tom Duncan's widow.""

Sergeant Bannion is the homicide detective on the case. Almost against his will, Bannion has the first inklings of suspicion while questioning the wife, Bertha, at the scene. She says, ""Everything Tom ever did was clean and wholesome. That's the kind of man he was.""
Bannion: ""Do you know why he took his life?""
Bertha: ""Why. It must have been his health. Sometimes, the past few months, he complained about pain in his left side. When I suggested he see the police surgeon, he made excuses.""
Okaaay. He killed himself for fear of what he didn't know he had?

Next oddness, Lucy Chapman calls the police to say that Duncan didn't shoot himself. Since we SAW him shoot himself, what is her angle?

Being a film of it's time (and type), women in ""The Big Heat"" are attachments, but they are not portrayed as dumb and boy, do they have their say. There's a lot of psychology in the show, a little broad brush, perhaps, but there's food for thought. For example, young beautiful Debbie Marsh would be concerned about her scarred face not just in terms of vanity. She makes her living off her face. Her looks are her livelihood, and it's a double whammy when her boyfriend throws a pot of hot coffee in her face.

When this film came out, it was considered very violent and Bannion going out for revenge was morally repugnant. We're too desensitized now to be much bothered.

On this DVD you get an 89 minute movie, presented in full screen with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Audio is mono. Watch it in English or dubbed in French. You can also get subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai.

DVD extras are limited:
1. Vintage Advertising. ""The Big Heat"" poster.\
2. Theatrical Trailers, for 3 movies:
....a. ""The Big Heat""  ---  ""I WAS A COP BEFORE HE BUSTED ME... AND THESE FOUR GIRLS WERE ALIVE BEFORE THEY MET HIM.""
....b. ""The Lady From Shanghai"" --- with Orson Welles and starring Rita Hayworth as a blonde.
....c. ""Suddenly, Last Summer"" --- ""SUDDENLY YOU ARE FACE TO FACE... WITH A NEW EMOTIONAL PEAK IN MOTION PICTURE MAKING"". To tell the truth, I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again. It has some striking scenes, all right, but it is depressing and despairing.

A recommended movie. Not the very best film noir, but definitely good.

517135,5,6302797675,"THE BIG HEAT, (1953). German auteur Fritz Lang directs this gritty, violent crime drama, set in an unidentified big American city that follows Dave Bannion.  Bannion (Glenn Ford), a detective who investigates a police sergeant's suicide, begins to suspect foul play.  He is promptly taken off the case.  So he defies his superiors, and continues to pursue the case on his own, leading to tragic consequences for himself and others around him.  This brisk 89-minute suspense classic is widely considered a masterpiece of crime noir: the directors lighting and shadows help immeasurably to establish its dark mood, and its deep-focus photography is a profound illustration of what can be achieved in black and white.

The picture also benefits from superior acting.  As Bannion, Ford,(3:10 TO YUMA, GILDA), forcefully carries it, giving us a moving performance as a determined, honest, upright, but unscrupulous man in law enforcement.  The  young Lee Marvin, (THE DIRTY DOZEN, THE BIG RED ONE), began his career playing violent threatening characters before growing into leading action-adventure roles.  He here provides strong support as Vince Stone, a sadistic gangster, an important player in the politically powerful crime syndicate that rules the city.  Gloria Grahame, (ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, IN A LONELY PLACE), does strong work as Debby Marsh, Stones cowed girlfriend, an easy-going, none too moral young beauty whos been rich and poor, and prefers rich, with mink coat.  Jeanette Nolan turns in a sinister performance as Bertha Duncan, the suicide cops similarly mink-coated widow.  Jocelyn Brando looks a lot like her famous brother as Bannions wife Katie.  Alexander Scourby is a threatening presence as Mike Lagana, boss of the mob.  The womens expressive wardrobes are by award-winning costumer Jean Louis.  Sydney Boehm  wrote the screenplay, based upon William P. McGiverns Saturday Evening Post serial.  It was produced by Robert Arthur with atmospheric music by Henry Vars.

The film is violent, and a lot of the violence is directed at its female characters, so be warned.  And the plot is nothing new, was probably old-hat in its day.  Still, I found the picture powerful and moving, thanks to its skilled acting and direction.  Worth seeing.",1387584000,,2259,5.271708683473389

Glenn Ford turns in a truly great performance as a principled, yet dangerous, cop. The way Ford transforms from gentle, caring husband and father to steely menace when confronting enemies is remarkable. The film efficiently goes about its business and has an exciting, intense showdown at the end.

The Blu-Ray remastering is excellent. I never knew how unbelievable these old movies can look until I was floored by the BD release of Casablanca. Glad more and more of the terrific old films like this are being releases on Blu-ray, that are not necessarily well known among those that are not old film buffs.",1363996800,4,1007,4.820809248554913

There have certainly been far stronger femme fatales than Gloria Grahame!  And while Lang's direction and cinematography is sure, at times striking, artistically this film is a far cry from his earlier, German successes.  So terms like exceptional, masterpiece, or even classic -- depending on definition -- seem over generous if not excessive.  Instead, a modest, generally well-made example of the genre that is deserving of recognition, but hardly the adulation being given elsewhere here. 3 to 3.5 stars for Twilight Time's blu-ray edition.",1362700800,,984,5.32258064516129

517178,4,6302797675,"Although Huston's ""Maltese Falcon"" is usually cited as the first true Film Noir title, in many ways the Expressionism of Fritz Lang's German silent films made noir possible, or at least suggested the stylistic hallmarks that would later mark the genre. So, as an American import, Lang's pedigree as a master of the first order is unquestionable. ""M"" is maybe a better call for the FIRST true noirish crime thriller. Light and shadow, evil and good, wholesome and putrid, Lang displays it all. I'm no Glenn Ford fan (he seems a little lifeless and one dimensional to me) but Lee Marvin shines as the thuggish heavy, and Gloria Graham is the sharp taling gangster's moll with more than a little revenge up her own sleeve.

(Material edited and abridged from Wikipedia, source acknowledged-RC)

Film noir starring Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame, and Lee Marvin. It is about a cop who takes on the crime syndicate that controls his city after the brutal murder of his wife. Written by former crime reporter Sydney Boehm based on a serial by William McGivern which appeared in the Saturday Evening Post; published as a novel in 1952. Selected for inclusion in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011. Proclaiming it ""one of the great post-war noir films"", the Registry states that The Big Heat "" manages to be both stylized and brutally realistic, a signature of its director Fritz Lang.""

When it came out in 1953, The New York Times and Variety both gave The Big Heat very positive reviews. Bosley Crowther of the Times described Glenn Ford ""as its taut, relentless star"" and praises Lang for bringing ""forth a hot one with a sting."" Variety characterized Lang's direction as ""tense"" and ""forceful."" Critic Roger Ebert listed the film among his category of ""Great Movies""; he praised the film's supporting actors. Writer David Meyer states that the film never overcomes the basic repugnance of its hero, but notes that some parts of the film, though violent, are better than the film as a whole. ""Best known is Gloria Grahame's disfigurement at the hands of ber-thug Lee Marvin, who flings hot coffee into her face.""

It would not be a Fritz Lang without its twist: According to film critic Grant Tracey, the film turns the role of the femme fatale on its head: ""Whereas many noirs contain the tradition of the femme-fatale, the deadly spiderwoman who destroys her man and his family and career, The Big Heat inverts this narrative paradigm, making Ford the indirect agent of fatal destruction. All four women he meets--from clip joint singer Dorothy Greene to gun moll Gloria Grahame--are destroyed.""

517184,5,6302797675,"Exciting, violent and downright wild for its time, Fritz Lang's THE BIG HEAT kicks off Twilight Time's releases for the month of May, and for film noir fans, this crackerjack thriller never ceases to disappoint.

Glenn Ford plays the dogged (and, at times, almost too determined) cop who, upon investigating the apparent suicide of a fellow police officer, finds out that corruption exists at nearly every level in his county, all of it stemming from a local crime boss named Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) calling the shots. Lagana's web extends down to Ford's own bosses, hindering an investigation that takes the family man down a dark path at a personal cost to his own wife (Jocelyn Brando) and the women who aid him in his pursuit of justice, including Gloria Grahame in a fine performance as one of the gangster's molls.

""The Big Heat"" is sensationally entertaining for its genre, and also extremely, notably nasty to virtually all of the film's female leads. The ladies in Sydney Boehm's screenplay are burned, scarred, murdered and blown up - a litany of body bags that accentuates the horror of the film's villain, who also uses a henchman played by a young Lee Marvin to carry out the unpleasantness. Ford's alternately earnest and tough delivery makes his detective sympathetic to a degree, though his almost fanatical desire to see justice carried out ends up making his misery something of his own personal doing.

Lang's visuals - in particular his trademark use of shadows - bring the punchy material to life in a film that deservedly ranks among the best of its genre, and it's certainly one of the more memorably violent pictures of the `50s as well.

Twilight Time's Blu-Ray boasts a crisp 1080p AVC encoded transfer layered with fine grain and detail. This is one of those titles you ought to drag out as a demo disc for any friends who don't think there's anything to be gained from watching old black-and-white movies in HD. The full-bodied DTS MA mono audio is effective as well - sounding almost stereophonic at times - while an isolated score track of Henry Mars' efficient underscoring (credited to Mischa Bakaleinikoff) and a re-issue trailer put the cap on a must-have disc for noir buffs.",1336953600,33,2219,4.862433862433862

Directed by Fritz Lang

The Big Heat is director Fritz Lang's landmark bleak, film noir crime classic and violent melodrama. Lang's characteristic expressionistic lighting, use of sets and decor, and costuming sharply reflected the personality traits of the film's major characters. The sparse screenplay of a story laced with revenge, murder, and hate was written by former crime reporter Sidney Boehm and based on a Saturday Evening Post serial and the hard-hitting, brutal 1952 novel by William P. McGivern. The film's title referred to the enforcement crack-down on lawlessness and illegal activities.

Its an uncompromising and grim story of an iron-willed, driven, dedicated, honest, incorruptible homicide detective within a crooked and perverted society and corrupt system at all levels (e.g., the mob, the commissioner, the police, and everyday citizens), and the enormous price that is paid to find justice. The crusading, vigilante rogue cop/hero must erode his idealistic, law-abiding principles when he resorts to the unlawful tactics of the hoodlums after the tragic murder of his young wife by sadistic, viperous gang members led by a big-time crime boss. He enlists the help of one of the gangs' molls in order to seek revenge.

Lang & Ford combined again for Human Desire (1954)

Special footnote: -- When Lee Marvin first sees Glenn Ford face to face, the music in the background is ""Put the Blame on Mame,"" a reference to Ford's performance in Gilda ~~~ Columbia wanted to borrow Marilyn Monroe from 20th Century Fox to play the role of Debby Marsh, but Fox's asking price was too high. Gloria Grahame was cast instead.

517232,3,6302797675,"The movie has all of the elements of decent film noir. A serviceable but unspectacular story--bad cop kills self, leaves suicide note revealing prevalent corruption, alienated wife secrets note in exchange for payoff from local boss, clean cop continues investigation into suicide despite increasing pressure until his own wife is killed in car bomb explosion meant for him, cop turns in badge and relentlessly works to expose corruption and ID wife killers. A workable story, but a synopsis pretty much does it justice, which is not a good thing. Yes, there is a fairly interesting bad guy (Lee Marvin) and his decent girlfriend (Gloria Grahame) and the requisite staff of good cops, bad cops, thugs, stoolies, and so on, but nothing really happens to set the story apart or make it especially interesting or memorable.  As to the atmospherics, the movie lacks the grit of really effective noir. It's noir on a freshly painted Hollywood back lot. Even the ""subterranean"" world of shady nightclubs and B-girls seems a bit like a run-down Holiday Inn.  And the brightly lit ""happy home"" scenes with Glenn Ford, his wife and child, and their banter of wedded bliss might be interesting if shaded with a liberal dose of irony, but they are not. They play more like beer advertisements for a carefree life in the suburbs and seem laughably out of place. Yes, we understand the contrast with the ""dirty streets"" (which actually look quite clean and safe) but these cheery scenes are a bit much.  The casting is quite good. Grahame is one of the best things in the movie and Fritz Lang gets a lot out of all his actresses.  Lee Marvin is typically imposing but for me, despite a couple of famous incidents of violence (the hot pot of coffee in the face of Grahame, for instance) I just don't feel that uncontrolled brutality  verging on insanity boiling just beneath the surface, as say in his performance as Liberty Valence.  Close, but not quite.  The biggest downer, however, is Glenn Ford. I have never understood Ford's attraction as a ""leading man,"" at least a young one.  The qualities he brought to the screen allowed him to grow and age well as an actor,  but as a younger man, he is not that interesting or compelling or even that good of an actor. Admittedly, his performance here far outshines his turn in ""Gilda,"" a catastrophically bad performance.  Here, he is likeable and believable enough and, wisely, Lang doesn't ask him to do too much emotionally, as on the murder of his wife, because range is not one of Ford's strong points.  Still, he is not really interesting enough to carry us with him through the movie and, when he is tempted by ""the dark side,"" in a hotel scene with Grahame or violent confrontations with various wrongdoers where he might overstep Hollywood hero propriety and wield his personal scimitar of justice, well, we really don't believe he has the kind of fury within him that it is a victory to overcome to remain among the righteous.
Finally, the film has been praised as one of Fritz Lang's Hollywood masterpieces. On this count, I was disappointed.  Very possibly Lang was working under a number of constraints he never faced in his early, groundbreaking, brilliant career in Germany.  But I found nothing especially memorable about this film from a directorial perspective.  It is reasonably well paced, the actors give decent performances, he did a decent job with only a fair script, but there is nothing visually exciting about the film, combined with a singular lack of the kind of atmosphere that makes noir special--that dark, haunting sense of dangerous uncertainty, suspense and menace.  All in all, a good enough movie, but hardly a classic of the genre.  Call it ""noir light.""",1311724800,4,3727,4.827315541601256

517236,4,6302797675,"""The Big Heat"" is classic film noir, directed by none other than Fritz Lang, one of the fathers of film noir. Lang was called the ""Master of Darkness"" by the BFI. More than anyone else he is responsible for popularizing the German school of expressionist film, with  the ""Dr. Mabuse"" series (1922, 1933, 1960), the revolutionary ""Metropolis"" (1927) and the frightening ""M"" (1931) which launched the career of Peter Lorre. Though he wasn't a Jew, Lang fled German in 1934 once the Nazis took over. He eventually came to the US where he made such notable films as ""Fury"" (1936), ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940), ""Western Union"" (1940), ""Hangman Also Die"" (1943), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944), ""Scarlet Street"" (1945), and ""Clash by Night"" (1952). While he was never nominated for an Oscar, his work influenced the work of many directors, including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.

""The Big Heat"" stars Glenn Ford, Gloria Grahame and Lee Marvin with great supporting performances by Jeannette Nolan, Willis Bouchy and Carolyn Jones.

Quiet and handsome Glenn Ford appeared in more than 100 films from 1937 to 1991. He was nominated for a Golden Globe 3 times and won once (""Pocketful of Miracles"" in 1961). Ford could do light comedy (e.g., ""Teahouse of the August Moon"", ""Courtship of Eddie's Father"", ""Don't Go Near the Water"") as well as drama (e.g., ""Blackboard Jungle"", ""3:10 to Yuma""). He enjoyed playing the everyman and said that ""it gives the audience someone real to identify with. I never play anyone but myself on screen."" In this film Ford plays a cop out for revenge.

Lee Marvin started in films in 1951. In 1952 alone he appeared in 6 films and 5 TV shows. He got his big break in 1953 with roles in ""The Big Heat"" and ""The Wild One"" with Marlon Brando. In 1962 he did a terrific job in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", won the Oscar for his 20th film, ""Cat Ballou"" in 1965, and in 1967 he appeared in ""Point Blank"", ""The Professionals"" and ""The Dirty Dozen"".  No one was better as the villain than Lee Marvin, and his role in ""The Big Heat"" is one of the roles that helped launched his long and illustrious career.

Gloria Grahame was one of the Queens of film noir. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for ""Crossfire"" (1947) with Robert Mitchum (one of the Kings of film noir), won for ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952) with Kirk Douglas, and gave memorable (if not award worthy) performances in other noirs such as ""In a Lonely Place"" with Humphrey Bogart, ""Sudden Fear"" (1952) with Joan Crawford and Jack Palance, and Fritz Lang's ""Human Desire"" (1954) with Glenn Ford. Grahame plays Marvin's girlfriend. Grahame  says - ""The main thing is to have the money. I've been rich and I've been poor. Believe me, rich is better.

Jeannette Nolan made nearly 100 films and played in nearly as many TV shows. She made her film debut with Orson Welles in ""Macbeth"" (1948) as Lady Macbeth, and her last in 1998 as Robert Redford's mother in ""The Horse Whisperer"".  Nolan plays the corrupt wife of a murdered corrupt policeman.

Jocelyn Brando plays Ford's doomed wife. Best known for being Marlon's older sister, she appeared in two of his films (""The Ugly American"" in 1963 and ""The Chase"" in 1965) and a dozen other films (e.g., ""Mommie Dearest"" in 1981), as well as nearly 100 TV appearances.

Willis Bouchey is known for his many roles in John Ford and/or John Wayne films (e.g., the train conductor in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" who puts the coda on the film by telling James Stewart that ""nothin's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance"",  President of the court martial in ""Sergeant Rutledge"") as well as more than 200 TV appearances. I remember him best as the President of the U.S. in ""Red Planet Mars"" (1952) who delivers the final eulogy for Peter Graves and Andrea King. Bouchey plays Ford's commanding officer.

Adam Williams made a career out of playing villains. He's the car bomber in ""Big Heat"", stalked Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest"", killed women in ""Without Warning"" (1952), etc. It's a curious set of roles for a decorated WW 2 pilot. One of his good guy roles was as the Psychiatrist in ""Fear Strikes Out"" (1957). He fared much better on TV where he made more than 100 appearances

Peter Whitney appears as a bartender. Whitney's massive frame and enormous head awash with bushy eyebrows made him a natural heavy in films like ""Underground"" (1941), ""Murder he Says"" (1945), and ""Three Strangers"" (1946). In the 50s he transitioned to TV appearing in dozens of series. He had a recurring role as Sgt. Sinclair in ""The Rough Riders"" (1958-9).

Carolyn Jones is best remembered as Morticia on ""The Adams Family"" (1964-8) for which she won the Golden Globe. Her first big break came in the 3D ""House of Wax"" (1953), she won acclaim for ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (1956), and she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in ""The Bachelor Party"" (1957). The on screen sexuality that she oozed served her well and she landed a co-starring role with Elvis in ""King Creole"" (1958) and eventually the role as Morticia. She plays a brief role as a woman burned with a cigarette by Marvin.

John Doucette puts in a brief role as an Army buddy of Ford's brother-in-law. Douchette's gruff manners and his deep voice made him a popular player in more than 200 films and TV shows, mostly westerns. He appeared in several John Wayne films (""True Grit"", ""Sons of Katie Elder"", ""Big Jake"") as well as memorable roles in ""The Robe"" (1953) and ""Cleopatra"" (1963).

Although most critics consider this a film noir, it must be noted that while the film has many film noir elements, the hero, Ford, is not compromised by the femme fatale, and in fact, he is the vehicle by which the femme fatales perish. Classicists may conclude that this is nourish, but not classic film noir.

The film is shot by Charles Lang (no relation to Frtiz). Lang was nominated more times for an Oscar than any other Director of Photography (18 times), but won only once - ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1934). The nearly 150 films he photographed differed in content and style, and Lang was an eclectic, though he did film one other film noir movie  - ""Sudden Fear""  (1952) with Gloria Grahame.

The early 50s saw several similar themed  films  -  ""The Enforcer"" (1951), ""Captive City"" (1952), ""Chicago Syndicate"" (1955) - largely as a result of the Kefauver Commission investigation of organized crime. This turned the focus of film makers away from the individual criminal (Rico in ""Little Caesar"" and ""Public Enemy"" and  Tony in ""Scarface"") to the organization, and by extension, the greater society.

For Fritz Lang fans, there is a similar film, called ""Rancho Notorious"" (1952) that is a western with similar themes as ""The Big Heat"". Arthur Kennedy places a good rancher whose fianc (Gloria Henry) is raped and killed and he gets involved with a femme fatale played by Marlene Dietrich in his quest for revenge. The Lee Marvin role of the savage henchman is played by Mel Ferrer.

The film is classic Fritz Lang in that it explores Lang's belief that people are conflicted, the doppelganger or double personality. Lang often used mirrors to express this, as when Peter Lorre (in M) looks in the mirror, or when Gloria Grahame constantly examine s herself in the mirror - notice how she changes personalities. Grahame is both the mob girl and the heroine. One side of her face is beautiful, the other scarred. Ford is both cop and thug.

Lang also loved to illustrate life's vicissitudes. Chance is a major player. It's by chance that Ford's wife starts his car. It's by chance that Grahame is in the bar when Ford arrives. It's chance that Ford and Grahame are seen leaving the bar together by one of Marvin's henchmen. Etc.

Lang also liked to show that heroism, like villainy, lay within each person, and wasn't the place of the superman. Thus Ford is a very average copy who must reach inside himself to become the hero, and he does this by finding his other self. Grahame, on the other hand, becomes the heroine by reaching inside herself to find that other woman.

This is a violent film, to say the least. A woman gets blown up, another one is scalded with hot coffee, and another is burned with a cigarette. We have suicide, murder and assault thrown in, along with corruption and betrayal. Some of this occurs off screen, but much of it is on screen.

The film got good reviews. The New York Times called it ""a hot one with a sting"" and Variety praised Lang for being ""tense, forceful direction"" and said the cast was ""top notch trouping led by Glenn Ford.""  It's certainly a good film, holds up pretty well, and benefits from strong performances by almost everyone in the cast. But it's not really a film noir piece, and it certainly doesn't represent the best of Fritz Lang's work, although it is a classic Lang story with something less than the classic Lang stylistic lighting effects.

Definitely worth a look even after all these years.",1273968000,4,8981,4.7
517237,4,6302797675,"I won't bore you with another summary of the plot which previous reviews already covered. Just a few comments that may have not been made yet.

The editing of this film is perfect. Many films of the period drag and have scenes that are slow or waste space. This one has none of that. That's one reason why it feels modern.

The casting of The Big Heat is also first rate; there isn't a single weak performance from top to bottom. I watched this film because I'd seen Ford in Gilda, and read some of his bio, and wanted to see how he did in this film. He has a similar intensity as we saw in Gilda as Johnny Farrell opposite Rita Hayworth. Strong, brash, driven, a little out of control, with a hint of vulnerability.

The mobster in The Big Heat says he doesn't want to make the same mistake as Lucky Luciano. Don't know if there are many mob movies from the era with a mob mistress playing a big role. This was good. The sassy, confident, elegant chick gets a bigger role than you would expect in this movie.

The ending is fairly satisfying but everything is wrapped up a little too neatly and a little too quickly.

If you are offended by violence against women, skip this movie. A wife is  blown up by dynamite in a car. A prostitute is burned and murdered. A mob mistress is savagely mutilated by burning coffee. A card dealer girl has her hands crushed. Two other women are shot and killed.",1244505600,5,1396,4.309160305343512
517248,4,6302797675,"'The Big Heat' is a film noir classic due to its original and riveting plot. The film draws you right in with the suicide of a police officer in his home and his widow, Bertha Duncan (played by Jeanette Nolan) who hides the suicide note which implicates Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby), the town's number one crime boss. Duncan concocts a plot to blackmail Lagana, making sure the suicide note is released to the press in the event of her death.

Assigned to investigate the suicide is Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford). Bannion interviews Duncan who is uncooperative and hostile. Bannion then gets a tip from B-girl Lucy Chapman who insists that Duncan's husband didn't commit suicide and implied that he was on Lagana's payroll. (I had trouble believing that she would have met with Bannion in open view at the nightclub which easily tipped off the mobsters that she was spilling her guts). Bannion turns up dead the next day, the victim of multiple stab wounds and possible sexual assault by a psychopath (the coroner's report to Bannion on the B-girl's death foreshadows some of the more explicit scenes of violence to come).

When Bannion gets a phone call threatening his family at home, he decides to confront Lagana directly. Lagana is depicted as a man who seeks to project an image of a model citizen--he even has a picture of his mother on the wall and tells Bannion that he cared for her in his home right before her death a year before. Bannion isn't impressed by Lagana's phony resume and ends up slugging Lagana's bodyguard which outrages the crime boss further.

In a scene you can never forget, after Bannion gives his wife the car keys, she leaves to go on an errand while he's singing nursery songs to his daughter. Suddenly there's a tremendous explosion right outside the window. Bannion runs out to find his wife trapped in a burning car. He breaks the car window and pulls her out. But it's too late. She's the victim of a car bomb.

After the funeral (never seen on screen), Bannion meets with the Police Commissioner who suggests that his wife was murdered by criminals Bannion may have locked up in the past. It's clear that he doesn't want to investigate the possibility of Lagana's involvement. Bannion accuses the Commissioner of being in league with Lagana who promptly demands his resignation. Bannion turns in his badge but keeps his gun which he bought himself.

Bannion finds out from the crime lab that parts of the bomb are linked to an auto salvage shop. The owner at the shop won't tell him anything but after he leaves, a crippled woman who works at the shop as an office assistant, tells him that a man named Larry called the shop from a nightclub (The Retreat) where Bannion had met the recently deceased B-girl Chapman earlier. Unable to find out who Larry is, Bannion still makes the acquaintance of Lagana's right hand man, Vince Stone (played by a very young Lee Marvin) at the Retreat. Bannion prevents Stone from beating up a woman who he's been playing a game of dice with at the bar.

Stone's girlfriend, Debby Marsh (played by an over-the-top Gloria Grahame) comes on to Bannion and they end up at his hotel room. Bannion wants Debby to tell him who Larry is but she's more interested in having an affair with him. Later, after Vince finds out that Marsh has been talking with Bannion, he scalds her face with a pot of steaming hot coffee. With her face (and life) basically ruined, Marsh has no compunctions about revealing Larry's identity. Bannion confronts Larry Gordon, the sadistic hit-man hired by Vince to kill Chapman as well as the one responsible for the death of Bannion's wife. But Bannion doesn't kill him--he extracts the information he's been looking for: Bertha Duncan has been blackmailing Lagana all along with her now deceased husband's suicide note. He tells Gordon that he plans to let his mob associates know that he's a snitch.

Debby Marsh now seeks revenge on both Stone and Lagana. She bumps off Duncan (who is the actual femme fatale in this film noir) and then throws scalding hot coffee in Vince's face at this apartment (how she so easily got in is not explained). Stone then shoots Marsh just as Bannion arrives who gets in a shootout with him. Now out of bullets, Bannion has a chance to finish Stone off but decides to hand him into the police. A newspaper headline reveals that Lagana and the Police Commissioner (who was seen in an earlier scene playing cards with Stone and was a witness to Stone scalding Marsh with the hot coffee) have been indicted and presumably on their way to jail. Bannion is restored to his old job (why he doesn't get a promotion I have no idea) and once again is a respected member of the Police Force.

What sets 'The Big Heat' apart from some of the lesser ""B-rated"" film noirs is the complicated plot as well as director Fritz Lang's decision not to 'soft pedal' any of the violent scenes here. His message is that when criminals kill, they do so with no conscience. So the car bombing scene along with Lee Marvin's treatment of women (to the point where he has no pangs about throwing a pot of scalding coffee in a woman's face) is both explicit and shocking. The collusion of the 'respectable' Police Commissioner and the timidity Bannion's colleagues add to the overall atmosphere of dread. The Big Heat is by no means a 'perfect' film as it sometimes falls back into the typical sentimental moments of the B noir. The story however is most satisfying as it will keep you riveted in your seat throughout.",1236988800,,5526,4.66051282051282
517249,5,6302797675,"Intense characters, led by Glenn Ford's portrayal of ""Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion,"" make this one of the better film noirs of the period, at least one of the ones most people seemed to enjoy the most.....me included.

Ford is a believably 100 percent honest and tough cop who is unrelenting in getting his wife's killer. (His wife is killed early on in a car bomb.) Ford takes the law into his own hands, which really contradicts what he stands for, and is not least bit apologetic for his actions, either. Make no mistake: this is a pure ""revenge"" film.

Gloria Grahame, Lee Marvin, Jocelyn Brando, Alexader Scourby, Jeanette Noland and Carolyn Jones complete the cast of ""name"" actors of the period. No surprise that Marvin plays the lead villain.

SPOILER - Grahame almost steals the show as Marvin's girl who gets scalded when the latter throws hot coffee in her face - one of the more shocking scenes in film noir history. She then, understandably, switches allegiances.

It was kind of fun to see Marvin at such a young age. This was my first look at Scourby. Pro football fans know his distinctive voice well, as he became the voice of the NFL Films for many years.

One of the attractions of this story is the pace: it is fast-moving, and it's not too dated either, despite being over 40 years old. I have no complaints about the transfer on this DVD, either. It looks good. This is highly recommended for crime buffs of any era.",1233014400,2,1432,4.578125

The Big Heat is one of Lang's better movies, thanks to an outstanding script, great performances from the cast (Glenn Ford gives another understated, but powerful performance, Lee Marvin is excellent as the menacing thug, and Gloria Grahame is, well, Gloria Grahame - in a part you'd think was written for her), and, of course, thanks to the great direction of Fritz Lang himself.

This is a more straightforward detective/crime thriller than many of Lang's other movies, but he handles it extremely well.  Ford is homicide detective Dan Bannion, who is assigned to investigate the suicide of a fellow officer.  Bannion uncovers indications that this wasn't just a case of depression, and he stumbles into a case that some of his superiors want closed as a suicide and nothing more.  With so much pressure from above to just let the whole thing go, Bannion forges ahead, getting into trouble along the way - trouble that would have tragic consequences for him.

The Big Heat delivers on all counts, and while not quite as NOIR as many Films Noir (it would fit in the Police Procedural category of Film Noir), it still fits squarely in the genre with many dark twists and turns - and some fairly brutal scenes.

What is more, there are some secondary actors that do an outstanding job, specially the young woman that plays Debbie Marsh (Gloria Grahame), the beautiful girlfriend of one of the gangsters Bannion is after.

Fritz Lang's deft direction is impeccable; the pacing is fast and keeps your attention all the time, and the cast is full of excellent actors.

Glenn Ford is magnificent as the embittered policeman; charged with hatred and revenge in his veins. Gloria Grahame is excellent, as always, as the apparently air-headed gangster's moll, with a ""hidden ace in her sleeve"". Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's older sister) is very fine as Ford's down-to-earth and strong-tempered wife. Lee Marvin excels in one of his first tough roles as a psychopathic hit man.

Others in this excellent cast are: Jeanette Nolan (who played Lady Mac Beth opposite Orson Welles in the latter's rendition of Shakespeare's Classic), as a hard-as-nails, ambitious, no-holds barred woman; Carolyn Jones in a small role as a gangster's moll (victimized by Lee Marvin); and Edith Evanson, a very active character actress, plays a crippled secretary, who's a pivotal circumstantial witness of some shady-doings that occur during the film's course.

Also, look for Celia Lovsky, a prolific character actress and Peter Lorre's first wife and who (reputedly) was responsible for his casting in the title role of Fritz Lang's 1931 German masterpiece ""M"", featured as (mobster) Lagana's mother on a painted portrait he has in his study.

There's a nice vignette during the film; when Glenn Ford's character enters ""The Retreat Club"" and meets Lee Marvin's character face-to-face, ""Put the Blame on Mame"" ( Gilda's famous song) is playing on the background.

Ford is ordered repeatedly by his lieutenant to stop interfering, but,obsessed with vengeance, walks out of the police department and sets out to get Marvin and Scourby unrestrained by the delicacies of police technique and the influence brought to bear on his superior...

The film's tensions are strongly intensified by :

- Dorothy Green, the 'B-girl' who tells Bannion that she was Tom Duncan's girlfriend and that the policeman had no reason to kill himself...

- Jeannette Nolan, the grieving widow who is ""on the take"" for years, and isn't silenced...

- Jocelyn Brando, the cozy martyred young wife who is brutally blown up in a car by a violent explosion intended for her husband... (An interesting foreshadowing of 'The Godfather.')

- Alexander Scourby (an interesting foreshadowing of ""The Godfather""), the suave chief villain and loving family man who at the same time ran a criminal empire with business efficiency...

- Willis Bouchey, a corrupted Lieutenant who orders Bannion to lay off the case...

- Howard Wendell, the Police Commissioner whom Bannion advises to find out who planted the dynamite in his car...

- Robert Burton, the detective who promises to help his companion, but off the record...

- Peter Whitney, the retreat's bartender who assumes a ""don't ask"" policy...

- Adams Williams, the mob who threats the obsessive detective to stay out of the case...

- Dan Seymour, the very cool and uncooperative 'scared rabbit.'

- Edith Evanson, the crippled secretary who offers the information Atkins withheld...

- John Crawford, Bannion's brother-in-law who makes a call at exactly 9:30 P.M. and ""ask for Larry.""

Considered at the time to reach a new low in violence, this excellent film noir crime classic also struck a new note of realism in crime films (gambling, conspiracy, extortion, murder...) and produced one of Glenn Ford's most typical performances...",1166400000,4,3103,5.096837944664031
517291,5,6302797675,"""The Big Heat"", Fritz Lang's concise, hard-hitting Noir drama, both defines the genre in it's 'mature' form (with the obligatory black and white, high contrast photography, a short running time, a hero, portrayed by Glenn Ford, who teeters between justice and vengeance, and villains, particularly Lee Marvin, every bit as shaded and complex as Ford), and tosses in, almost casually, a fascinating subtext, that the three central female characters of the film are, in fact, as essential as their male counterparts, and even more interesting! Portrayed by Jocelyn Brando (Marlon's older sister), Jeanette Nolan, and the fabulous Gloria Grahame, they are not only pivital to the plot, but actually become the characters you're most likely to leave the film talking about.

Beginning with the suicide of a cop 'on the take', who leaves a letter exposing the mob's connections with the police and local government, the film first introduces Nolan, as a less-than-grieving widow, who steals the letter, and uses it as leverage to enjoy 'the good life'. An underrated actress, usually cast in sweet-natured supporting 'grandmotherly' roles, Nolan here gets to cut loose, blackmailing the mob while tossing false 'leads' to cop Ford, and adjusting her 'image' to suit whatever situation she faces. Her portrayal, alone, would make this an extraordinary film!

Ford, the dedicated, honest homicide detective, has a history of ruffling official feathers to find the truth, and much of his strength comes from the love and support of wife Brando. Not your 'traditional' 50s wife, she 'samples' his drinks and food, hints at her satisfying sex life (remarkable, in itself!), and casually smokes while preparing dinner, sweetly bantering with her husband. In the smallest of the central female roles, it is easy to 'lose' her, between the flashier performances of Nolan and Grahame, but, in fact, she is the catalyst of the plot, whose untimely demise would set the chain of events in motion.

Then there is Gloria Grahame, the 'party girl' mistress of enforcer Lee Marvin...wisecracking, and blissfully ignorant of the risks she takes in verbally 'jabbing' her boyfriend's relationship to mob boss Alexander Scourby, she grabs the screen, each scene she's in, and makes Marvin's performance, as a genial yet psychopathic sadist, even better. When she warms up to Ford, she is rewarded with a pot of scalding coffee in the face, disfiguring her, and providing the hook to blow things wide-open...

Three powerhouse performances, by three terrific actresses!

Fritz Lang's American film work was always remarkable, and ""The Big Heat"" showcased him at the top of his form.

The film is, deservedly, a classic!",1159228800,16,2695,5.241299303944316
517292,4,6302797675,"This was one of the best Gangster Movies that I have seen in years. Glen Ford played the simmering Detective whose wife was murdered by a Gang Lord intent on killing Ford for his attempts to interfere in his racketering business. From start to finish the pace was electric, all the more realistic in black and white. Definetely worth a look.",1143072000,,341,4.60655737704918
517293,5,6302797675,"This review is for the 2001 Columbia/Tristar DVD.

The movie opens with a policeman committing suicide in his home.  His wife immediately finds him dead and reads a suicide note.  Instead of calling the police, she first calls a major crime syndicate boss named Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby).  The police eventually arrive at the dead policeman's house and detective sergeant Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford) leads the investigation.  At first, it appears to be an open and shut case of suicide, but Bannion digs a bit deeper and through a series of related circumstances, Bannion has reason to believe that Lagana had some involvement in the suicide.  At this point, not only Lagana appears to be his adversary, but a corrupt police department becomes an obstacle for getting to the bottom of the investigation.  From this point on, the movie advances to a very volatile conflict between Bannion and Lagana and the police department.

This movie was directed by Fritz Lang and was extremely well made.  It's not the typical cops versus bad guys movie for a number of reasons.  First, it reveals corruption high up inside a law enforcement agency.  Second, it shows a very personal and human side of the Bannion character.  Furthermore, Glenn Ford does an outstanding job walking the thin line of being a tough cop avenging the wrongs of some despicable people, yet maintains a high moral standard in the process.  Another thing that becomes obvious is that the villains are ruthless and the attacks are relatively brutal for this era.  A young Lee Marvin plays one of Lagana's henchmen.  Also, one will notice that even though it's a film noir movie, this 1953 film is noticeably different than the films made in the 1940's due to the more prosperous time of the era with different scenes taking place in several nice suburban homes, an upscale penthouse and a swanky lounge.  In other words, the mood is very dark but the ascetics of the settings are not. Overall, it's an intense movie with plenty of drama with a nearly flawless plot.

The DVD quality has a sharp picture, but it's clearly un-restored.  Some small specs of film wear could be seen continuously through the entire course of the movie, which is disappointing for a film this well made.  The sound is excellent.  The only bonus features are three vintage Columbia trailers including one for the Big Heat.

Within minutes I'm captivated with the movie and I still don't have a clue what I'm watching. A young Lee Marvin shows up as bad as any bad guy in film today. And then there's this gorgeous woman I've never seen before, Marvin's moll. Ford is delivering his lines with the same slow, raw intensity as Eastwood would twenty years later. In fact, as the movie progresses, it looks like Eastwood usurped the style. When there is a commercial break, I finally learn that the movie is the legendary ""The Big Heat"" by the equally legendary Fritz Lang. What a treat this afternoon movie proved to be. I recommend it to everybody. Oh, and about that woman. It turns out it's an actress named Gloria Grahmn. What a work of art-- her and the movie.",1120608000,4,851,4.3924050632911396
517295,5,6302797675,"The able direction of Fritz Lang and a well acted plot combined to make ""The Big Heat"" a taut crime drama.

Tough guy homicide cop Dave Bannion played very smoothly by Glenn Ford gets called in to investigate an apparent suicide by a colleague on the force.  Before that however we see the act and the cop, Duncan is discovered by his wife Bertha who cooly and emotionlessly reads an apparent suicide note confession.  The confession chronicles Duncan's involvement in the rackets orchestrated by crime boss Mike Lagana played by Alex Scourby.

Duncan's wife calls Lagana using the note to blackmail him.

Ford questions Duncan's girlfriend Lucy Chapman who tells him that he was going to dvorce his wife.  She soon turns up dead and Ford begins receiving threatening phone calls at home. Ford confronts Lagana who is protected by his sadistic henchman Vince Stone played with flair by Lee Marvin.

Ford's beloved wife Katie played by a very attractive Jocelyn Brando is tragically killed in a car bomb meant for him.  Ford goes ballistic in front of the corrupt police commissioner and gets suspended from the force.  He now can pursue his investigation without any encumberances from the police department.  With the help of Marvin's girlfriend femme fatale Debbie Marsh played by Gloria Grahame, Ford uncovers the whole sordid affair and exacts revenge on the guilty parties.

Glenn Ford normally cast in milder mannered roles than this really shines as the vengeance minded cop but also shows his sensitive side in his relationships with the ladies Grahame and Brando.  Lang accurately captures the high emotional level of this crackling plot.",1118966400,2,1647,5.03690036900369
517296,5,6302797675,"Glenn Ford plays a police detective who is told to stop a line of investigation that began with the suicide of a police officer.  A woman he had questioned following the suicide  -- the man's mistress -- is brutally murdered shortly after the interview. There's a mobster involved -- a very well connected mobster.  Lee Marvin plays the sadistic henchman of the mobster. The guys upstairs in city government (including the police commissioner) are putting pressure on Ford's boss to drop the whole business, but Ford refuses.  He pursues the matter on his own, to his own peril.

This isn't the Humphrey Bogart sort of ""noir"" film -- the ""hero"" is the police detective (Ford) at odds with the corruption in his community.  The story moves quickly -- no unnecessary scenes, really -- and the violence is primarily threatened and feared, rather than lengthy scenes (as opposed to the way they make movies now).  The tension has an almost Hitchcock quality, where you know you're dealing with some nasty people and the only question is what will happen to what character next.

This is an absolute classic if you like the noir genre -- and if you're not familiar with it, this is a great introduction.  Be warned if you're not familiar with ""noir"", this movie is B & W and rather brooding visually -- lots of night scenes.",1115078400,,1319,4.724890829694323
517297,5,6302797675,"""The Big Heat"" is a good-cop-vs-city-corruption story based on a serial by William P. McGivern that ran in the ""Saturday Evening Post"". Police Sergeant David Bannion (Glenn Ford) becomes suspicious while investigating the suicide of a police officer when the dead man's girlfriend is murdered shortly after she speaks to him. But Bannion is ordered to lay off the dead cop's sinister widow, Bertha Duncan (Jeanette Nolan), and to leave the murder case to another jurisdiction. He pursues the case anyway, confronting a prominent businessman named Mike Lagana (Alexander Scourby) who built his fortune on crime and to whom all roads of corruption in this town lead. Lagana's violent reprisal further provokes Bannion into an obsessive campaign to bring down the entire corrupt network of criminals, politicians, and complicitous cops.

Glenn Ford and director Fritz Lang give us a complicated picture of David Bannion, a man who is kind and devoted to his family, but whose obsessive pursuit of justice leaves a trail of death and destruction. The crusading cop who risks his life to combat the violence and corruption that permeate his town is, at the same time, generally unconcerned with the human cost of his pique. Bannion's single-mindedness is understandable considering his circumstances, but this good guy with admirable ambitions has the flaws of a self-righteous crusader. And that's a lot more interesting than a man who's all good.

Gloria Grahame gives a memorable performance as Debby Marsh, the girlfriend of one of Lagana's goons. She is the antithesis of the smart, literate Laurel Gray, whom Grahame portrayed in ""In a Lonely Place"". Debby is an unsophisticated-but-savvy, happy-go-lucky woman who tries to enjoy life in spite of depending on sadistic gangsters for her livelihood. And she suffers for being caught between the conflicting obsessions of two men: her boyfriend Vince and David Bannion. Debby's childlike voice and chin-up demeanor in the midst of moral chaos really make an impression.

The DVD (The Columbia/ Tristar 2001 release): Bonus features are ""Vintage Advertising"", which is a slideshow of some posters for the film, and Theatrical Trailers for ""The Big Heat"", ""The Lady from Shanghai"", and ""Suddenly, Last Summer"".

When Bannion investigates a murder that comes too close to the hoods' operation, they wire his car--only his wife is the one who's blown up. He quits the force and, full of hate and revenge, goes after the killers himself. Lee Marvin plays a sadistic nightmare who likes to beat up women; in a famous scene he throws hot coffee in girlfriend Gloria Grahame's face. After that Grahame decides to help Ford and together they get the job done. One of the best movies of its kind ever made. The script is taut and riveting, and the acting is superb.

517342,5,6302797675,"This noir would be great except for the workmanlike Glenn Ford. In this rather curious noir, the policeman Ford is portrayed as a loving family man who rushes home to read bedtime stories to his daughter, and to happily perform domestic chores with his kind, intelligent wife. Their relationship is almost too good and progressive...you know if has to end. I mean, it was almost emasculating our hero! Mr. Ford is touching and believable in the domestic scenes. However, in the fine tradition of ""this-dog-is-gonna-die"" the wife get's hit and Mr Ford goes on a revenge-induced tear. This second act is where Mr Ford's weakness shows. He doesn't convincingly convey the kind of rage one would expect. However, he does get the job done and by his dogged determination to do the right thing actually convinces his weak-kneed boss to join him on his righteous crusade.

Lee Marvin is actually sexy as the slack-jawed psychopath, and Gloria Grahame is great, as always, as the loose cannon high spirited floozy who gets used by everyone. The coffee-throwing scene is a classic. Recommended!",1108857600,4,1085,4.994475138121547
517343,3,6302797675,"What more can I say about how beautiful and sexy Gloria Grahame is on the silver screen. I thought she was unbelievable in another noir classic, In A Lonely Place.  Certainly she had a juicier leading lady part in the Bogart archetypal, but in The Big Heat she steals the show with classic 50's hard gal lines like when Lee Marvin admires her perfume.  She say's: ""It attracts mosquitoes and repels men.""

What is it with post-WW2 adult attire?  People look like they are overdressed for every event.  The men are decked out in an ugly porkpie hat and overcoats in all weather.  It's ninety degrees but Glenn Ford has a full suit and sweater on plus a heavy man's dress overcoat.  Wow, that must have been tough under hot lights.  The women all resemble Beaver Cleaver's mother in wide skirts and heavy, heavy fur coats.  This unreality of clothing and non-weather, the obvious closed Hollywood set, makes for a stagy Fritz Lang effort.  It looks campy to the modern eye including the Lee Marvin punk gangster swaggers.  There's nothing like a lurking, campy Lee Marvin.

This one rushes to a film noir climax. It's not as raw as Detour, the definitive noir primitive, but it builds nicely.",1105315200,4,1190,4.668269230769231

Tough and uncompromising, it is a provocative crime thriller that features Glenn Ford's best performance as an honest cop battling big-city corruption . . . and the terrible price he pays.

This is a top and excellent policial blessed for the great talent of Fritz Lang who still in that age literally shone with that magnetic and vital expressive force . As you know Lang was always interested in the dark side of the soul of the human being and if you look back in his previous noir filmography , the themes are deeply challenging and disturbed . This is a mature film all the way and one of my favorite and timeless cult movies of the fifties .",1091923200,5,688,4.251908396946565
517346,5,6302797675,"The Big Heat is similar to some of Fritz Lang's German films, like M and the Doctor Mabuse series.  It links crime and politics (or, more accurately, criminals and a politicians), and shows the future as concentration camp, where even those who imagine themselves on the outside of the barbed wire are trapped inside.
But is Lang retelling the story of what happened in Germany, or is he warning his adopted country what could happen if people didn't challenge authority (here the police department, including the commissioner) that had been corrupted by a criminal leader?  Maybe both.
The Big Heat is violent even compared to today's films and more believable than most.  However one thing that jars today  is the effeminacy of the crime boss, Mike Lagana, used as shorthand to show his corruption.
We first see Lagana in bed in silk pajamas with his bodyguard (in his robe) standing over Lagana, handing him the phone, lighting his cigarette.  When Dave Bannion (Glenn Ford), the homicide detective who won't follow orders and leave Lagana alone, barges into Lagana's mansion to confront him about a cop's suicide, Lagana is under a huge portrait of his dead mother (""We lived together in this house"").  Even from beyond the grave you can feel the mother's unhealthy influence on her son.  Lagana mentions his daughter but never his wife.
For the most part you can tell the criminals from the decent people because the criminals dress better.  Gloria Grahame's Debby Marsh, girlfriend of the vicious killer Vince Stone (Lee Marvin), tells the blackmailing wife of a policeman who was on the take, ""We're sisters under the mink.""
Debby and the cop's wife are just one pair of doubles in the movie.  There's also Debby and Katie, Dave Bannion's wife.  (Katie playfully suggests Dave tell his friends she's an heiress.  Later, trying to explain why she's with Vince, Debby asks Bannion, ""You think I was born an heiress?"")  Another set of doubles is Lagana's gang and the group of veterans Bannion's brother-in-law gets to protect Bannion's little girl.  One vet (described as a poet by one of his friends) shows Bannion his gun and says anyone who comes through the door for the girl is dead.  The poet transformed by war (definitely a non-WASP) says he's seen things you can only see from a tank, and starts to say he was one of the first into - -  What?  Auschwitz?  Vince and the hoods playing poker in his penthouse enjoy violence for its own sake.  The vets will only use violence if necessary to protect the innocent.  But the vets are playing poker too, and seem to relish the prospect of taking revenge on Bannion's enemies, who haven't done anything to them.  Between good and evil there are differences but also similarities.
Bannion goes to Victory auto repair, looking for a ""mechanic,"" an explosives expert.  The owner says he can't help (""I got a wife and kids, too"") but a crippled woman who works as a secretary tells Bannion what he needs to know.  Bannion stands outside the auto yard, talking through the fence.  Inside the compound the limping woman is just another of the unfit, the ""life undeserving of life"" tortured and exterminated in other camps, and in camps that exist today.
When Bannion tells the crooked cop's wife, ""The city's being strangled by a gang of thieves,"" she smiles and says, ""The coming years are going to be just fine.""  Just the way things looked in the thirties if you weren't one of those inside the camps.
""Thief"" is the strongest epithet Bannion uses.  Not ""killer"" or ""murderer.""  The criminals and the politicians who go along with them are stealing his city.  Though people don't like hearing what Bannion has to say, they're lucky he won't quit fighting the murderers among us.",1085443200,9,3732,4.799687010954616
517347,1,6302797675,"I can't believe anyone would rate this movie highly. The plot is predictable from the start. The writing is cliched to the max. At times I found myself saying, ""they'd never do that, or say that.""  Fritz Lang's overuse of melodrama was irritating. The performances by the actors were uneven.
In my mind, the Maltese Falcon, The Third Man, and Touch of Evil are the standards against which any other noir film should be measured. More recently Memento and Croupier are symbols of great film making in this genre. The story here falls way short of those benchmarks. (I'll spare you a rehash. Read the other reviews.) Glen Ford and Lee Marvin offer some good moments, but when they are bad, they stink the joint out. Same with the rest of the cast.

Contrast and black levels are beautifully rendered.  The audio is original mono and very well represented.
EXTRAS: True to form, Colombia doesn't care about extra features.  A real shame for this disc since a documentary would have been nice.  Still, considering that, in their recent releases (The Awful Truth, Talk of the Town) Colombia doesn't seem to care even about the picture quality of the actual movie, I'll take what I can get!

517365,5,6302797675,"In spite of the low profile it got at its initial release in the 50's, in spite of the modest budget and production value, THE BIG HEAT, with his already highly acclaimed M, is Fritz Lang's  greatest film, and one of the  highest achievement of cinema.  The stunning opening sequence, depicting  a police officer's suicide and its aftermath, is  a great example of  efficiency cinematic narrative, so are the 85 minutes that follow.  Lang  fills this film with powerful shots and speedy editing, never afraid to  show heightened violence when the story needs to. Many heated action  sequences are handled with impressive masterly. Unlike in the movies in  which Lang used famous Hollywood star (and the majority of them could not  cope with the severeness of his direction), Glenn Ford and Gloria Grahame  show powerful, convincing performances fused with emotion. Also featured  are Lee Marvin and Janet Nolan, as the ""bad guys"" and are equally  great.  But what makes THE BIG HEAT such a great film is the fact that it  is a profoundly humanist and moral film.  As many of Lang's American films  does, THE BIG HEAT depicts the corruption of the modern society.  In fact,  he never been as good as this in showing the system of how our society  functions: a newspaper headline, or even a telephone call may be more  powerful than guns and bullets, punches and tortures. The sophisticated  syndicate functions not with violence, but with the information of  violence. At the same time, Lang chose the protagonist of the film to be a  truly good human being, not a perfect super hero, but a cop who is  convinced to do an honest job, and ready to fight for this cause in spite  of all the corruptions that surround him. At one point of the story, he is  almost convinced that he is set alone against the entire world which is  corrupted. He comes very close to be obsessed by hatred towards other men.  But then he finds out that he can believe in people, that in spite of the  harsh reality of the world which obliges them to lie, to play D-and-D, to  be corrupted to save their own neck and wealthy life, in most people there  are also a desire to be a good human being.  THE BIG HEAT marks the  almost only occasion that Lang, the master of pessimistic visions of 20th  century, is himself not at all a pessimist, but a believer in human kind.",964915200,65,2345,4.5772946859903385
517366,5,6302797675,"Brilliantly directed by Fritz Lang, The Big Heat stands as one of the most symbolic crime/noir films in American cinema.  Working from a powerful script by Sydney Boehm, Lang merges the vengeful hostilities of an  incorruptable cop with the powerful forces that control big city politics.  Twenty years before Serpico, detective Dave Bannion ( Glenn Ford) lashes  out against the covert marriage of organized crime and the police force.  The Big Heat broke barriers that were previously unexplored in crime films.  Alex Scourby as Mike Lagana gives an accurate portrayal of how Mafia  bosses strived to legitimize their illegal deals as part of doing business  in America.  Lagana represented the Italian immigrant whose successes are  not only measured by his palatial mansion, but also by the social standing  and acceptance that he has solidified for his family.  Bannion angered by  Lagana's web of influence, stages a lone vendetta that intensifies when his  wife (Jocelyn Brando) is killed by a car bomb planted by one of Lagana's  hoods.  Boehm's script raised the bar for actors such as Lee Marvin ( Vince  Stone) to break the conventionality of crimminal behavior.  Stone's vicious  demeanor is waxed with a slick and suave manner.  Marvin does not have to  ""act"" like a tough guy a la James Cagney.  Vince Stone's screen  presence alone, redefined gangster behavior.  Not until Joe Peschi arrived  on the scene (Once Upon A Time In America, Goodfellas, Casino) did the role  of the gangster take on another dimension.  Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey  Bogart, and George Raft characterizations seem amateurish compared to the  rawness and unpretentiousness evident in Lee Marvin's performance.  Perky  Gloria Grahame also shines as Vince's girfriend Debbie, who pokes fun at  his subservience to the omnipotent Lagana. Frits Lang ushered in a new  dimension for the crime drama.  By 1953 most Americans could no longer deny  the existance or influence of organized crime upon society.  The days of  the ""Little Ceasars"" and the bootleggers were over; replaced with  a more complex and dangerous syndicate.  The Big Heat exemplified this when  the sanctity of a middle class family like the Bannion's is violently  destroyed.  The Big Heat pushed the envelope on crime violence and exposed  the vunerability of American society to a complex form of evil.",963878400,11,2360,5.164893617021277
517367,4,6302797675,"Basically a tough and compelling police melodrama. Lang adds tension and some scenes have become little gems, but he doesn't capture the atmosphere and essence of 'Noir'. The plot about corruption and greed is very tame by  today's standards and time has taken away much of the impact. This will  always be remembered as the film where Lee Marvin threw boiling coffee on  Gloria Graheme's face. Glenn Ford gives his best performance as the  tough-as-nails Bannion. Lee Marvin is also superb as the sadistic Vince.  But Gloria Graheme is the one who gives the most memorable performance as  Vince's moll who gets horribly disfigured and ultimately saves the day but  with tragic conclusions. The final shoot-out sequence is memorable and  Graheme's last speech is touching. Works better as a police drama than a  definitive 'noir'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!",963273600,8,873,4.924657534246576
517368,4,6302797675,"Everybody's rotten in this lousy town - except Glenn Ford. The pleasure of this film relies as much on the fabulous cast of bit characters as it does on the bad guys getting their comeuppance, especially Lee Marvin getting a  faceful of scalding coffee - cop that you pig!  These bit characters  include the fat man in the car yard, the blonde sidekick to Lee Marvin  always combing his hair, the barman in the night club and many others. I  don't think Glenn Ford has stood up over time as well as these other  characters but he's pretty darn good. Gloria Grahame is a delight. A must  see for lovers of the detective story and the FIGHT AGAINST A CORRUPT  WORLD.",956793600,4,664,4.429752066115703
517369,4,6302797675,"Ford plays an ""honest"" cop in this thriller directed by Fritz Lang. Alexander Scourby plays the big Lagana..
This film includes another fine performance by that mystical Gloria Grahame..She is the ringer and  plays her part superbly..I think Annette Benning is a modern day actress  with these qualities..?
Lee Marvin plays the sadistic Vince..and has  reprised such characters in later films. Ford, like Dana Andrews , acts  with his face also..making it all very real..

But much of the violence carried poetic justice along with it  particularly when sadistic, vicious punk Lee Marvin gets his. This is  certainly Fritz Lang's best film during the fifties and Glenn Ford is in  top form.

7831929,5,6302797675,"Glenn Ford is super bad ass in this film . He is 100% convincing as a complex man living in 2 worlds. Family life vs the crime underworld.
There have been so many attempt to make films where the point of the revenge story is to have the audience in a morally acceptable blood lust. What i mean by this is in our society if a member of ones family is killed it is automatically accepted for a family member to seek revenge. 9 out of 10 times this is never pulled off convincingly. Fritz Lang brilliantly does it knowing he is making an American film. Instead of doing the crazy violent ending he makes the whole film super gritty and intense leaving the ending mild so as to make it pass as a major release and to not upset a commercial audience too much.
Glenn Ford steals the show leaving Lee Marvin's role surprisingly underwhelming compared to Ford. Ford is more badass than Dirty Harry or Bogart in this film, seriously.
I am a big fan of the movie Gilda but always did not really like Fords character. This film shows his wide range of acting making this character totally different from the semi creepy character in Gilda. In the club scene they play the theme song from Gilda in the background as a cameo.
The only other element that is better than Ford performance is the dialogue.
The dialogue is 5 stars and i feel it doesn't get any better than this. It is some of the best writing in film noir history. Almost every line is a gem. There are tons of 1 liners.
I love this film it is a masterpiece.",1522454400,2,1508,4.294736842105263
