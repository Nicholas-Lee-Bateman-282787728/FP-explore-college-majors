4719321,5,B002AGGJ98,Captain Abu Raed is a beautiful film.  I saw it at a film festival and was won over by the subtle and touching nature of the work.  The director spoke after the film -- he's so full of life and joy and hope -- he made me like the film even more!  Well worth every penny to see this film.,1262736000,,287,3.75
4719322,4,B002AGGJ98,"Actually, I had no idea what to expect.  If you enjoyed ""Children of Heaven"" and ""Arranged"" (or movies like those), I think you will enjoy this one. It actually is ""heartwarming, poignant"" and a ton of adjectives along those lines.  Usually that means I will skip it (I'm not into schmaltzy types of movies), but this was free at the library so I rented it.

This was a big surprise and well-acted (*incredibly* well-acted by children with no previous acting experience), with an interesting story line.  Warning--there is a very serious side to this movie as is evidenced in the end.  Don't expect fun and games. In fact, had it ended in a different way I would have given it five stars.  Even at four stars, it's definitely worth watching.

Unless you understand Arabic, you'll need English subtitles.  If you detest subtitles and don't read Arabic, this movie won't be for you.  If you don't mind foreign films, you just may love it.  And don't miss ""Children of Heaven.""

PS--the bonus material is worth a look.",1396396800,2,1015,4.7102272727272725

Too bad The Hedgehog couldn't have been done like this! Abu Raed is a widower with no children other than his books. He works as a janitor at the Amman airport who finds a Captain's hat in the trash. He brushes it off, and wears it. One of the neighborhood boys sees it, and insists Abu Raed is a pilot, even though he says otherwise. The next morning, several children are at his door to hear his adventures; and so begins a delightful story. Of course, there is some sadness to be expected, but the beauty of the story far outweighs it. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy. And I understand the children were locals. My only complaint is the DVD is so far out of my price range I can't afford it.

(I posted this on my web site, and the Director contacted me and informed me new DVDs were being made, and the price would be much lower, $19-$20. I can hardly wait!)",1374883200,,927,4.261363636363637
4719325,5,B002AGGJ98,"Abu Raed is an aging widower in Jordan who works as a janitor at Amman International Airport.  Finding a discarded pilot's hat in a rubbish bin, he playfully sports it as he walks from the bus stop to his home. A local pack of children decide he must be a pilot and beg him to share his adventures with them.  He insists that he isn't a pilot but finally gives in and creates stories, inspiring them to believe that they can become somebody who has a meaningful life.  But this is just the beginning.  Abu becomes involved in the lives of two of the youngsters whose fathers abuse them - one by making him sell candy on the street instead of going to school, the other by physical violence to him and his mother.  What Raed discovers is the terrible ambiguity of attempting to set things right in the world.  He also discovers his own capacity for forgiveness, love, and sacrifice.  This is a lovely film.  Don't miss it!",1348185600,,921,4.408284023668639
4719326,5,B002AGGJ98,"When Abu Raed goes around wearing a pilot's hat, a group of children in Amman, Jordan beg to hear about his career and travels. At first, Abu Raed insists that he is no pilot, but eventually, he begins telling children stories about Greece, New York, and everywhere in between to add excitement to their poverty-stricken lives. One of the kids sets out to expose Abu Raed, and he eventually proves the old man is merely a janitor at the airport. Though Abu Raed's stories become discredited, he still tries to improve the lives of some of the children. In particular, he helps to keep one boy in school and protects another one--ironically, the boy who tore his travel stories apart--from physical and psychological abuse.

Considering that this movie was Jordan's first in 50 years, and was done with a pretty small budget, it is a very admirable story. The man playing Abu Raed has acted in minor roles before, but nearly all the children casted are first-time actors from refugee camps. The scenery is one of the film's best assets: just as Abu Raed tries to bring the rest of the world to these children in Amman, the director is presenting Amman to viewers around the world, who may otherwise have not been able to see the city and both its upper and working class districts.

The messages the movie sends out are great: that even a man of small means can create a better life for the people in his community. Moreover, even a poor janitor can enrich his life and the life of others through books, as that's where Abu Raed got the inspiration for his stories. The movie made me tear a little in the end as well. Anyone who enjoys sentimental movies will like this one.",1295308800,10,1673,4.573333333333333
4719327,3,B002AGGJ98,I liked the movie because I'm interested in Arab culture.  But the movie was too sentimental and feel-good-family type movie for my taste.  I prefer more provocative movies like Paradise Now.  Nadim Sawalha is an interesting actor.  I'm glad to see long time supporting actors like him get a chance to be leads.,1289865600,,311,4.811320754716981
4719328,5,B002AGGJ98,"I am a pilot and I love this movie!  This film has everything a good film has to have:  Good story, good  music, a villain, a hero, good acting, no noticeable swearing, a great moral, great photography, etc.  I wish more movies were like this!  Best kept secret out there.",1280448000,22,272,4.36
4719329,5,B002AGGJ98,"I'm always looking for good Arabic language movies.  My husband is from Lebanon and finding these movies aren't easy.  Luckily, most I do find are well worth the effort of searching, and this movie is no exception.

We both liked this movie and were happy to recommend it to others.

You can't help but fall in love with Captain Abu Raed!",1279411200,,338,4.491803278688525
4719330,5,B002AGGJ98,"This Jordanian film, nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Foreign Film division, is the story of an aging widower who is a janitor at the airport in Amman, Jordan.  Mistaken by neighborhood kids as an airline pilot, he begins to tell stories of travel and far away places that awe these poor children. The story develops as ""Captain"" Raed gets to the know the kids and the challenges they are facing at home. What I like about so many foreign films is that they are built on character development not fancy dialogue or non-stop action.  They actually make you think about the characters and what's going on in their lives and what the film is trying to say. At the end of the film, it leaves you wondering about some of the characters and what might have happened. Foreign films often do not have nice, neat, tidy endings like American films. There is some ambiguity. This is true of Captain Raed. If slick screenplay and unbelievable CGI's of action are your thing (nothing wrong with that) this will probably not interest you. If you enjoy realistic characters and a good story this is a worth watching.  It is also a slice of life and humanity and geography in a country many of us don't know much about - Jordan.  Highly recommend.",1279411200,4,1241,4.551569506726457
4719331,4,B002AGGJ98,"I bought this movie thinking of a fun, happy, entertaining movie. It is a good film, but full of crude reality that in the end left me brokenhearted and feeling empty.

Not that the tale was empty, in fact is very engaging and has good pace, however I felt there was more to say, there was a void in me that didn't know how to fill in.

I would recommend it for a viewier with a different idea in mind, different than the one I had. If you want to see a drama full of reality, a social reality that will leave you thinking why we can't enjoy life to the fullest and let others have a happy life, in peace? well, then you go for this one.

I gave it four stars because it is well made, but did not meet my own expectations.",1278979200,5,722,3.9655172413793105
4719332,5,B002AGGJ98,"This is a poignant and moving film with a twist at the end. It tells the story of three generations of Amman residents and is beautifully acted and edited.
I can't fault the film and await the next production from this talented crew with eager anticipation.",1273363200,3,257,4.608695652173913
4719333,4,B002AGGJ98,Another glimpse into the complex dicotomey that is the muslem world.  Interesting comparison of modern Jordan morays and life style contrasted with the dogma of old world morays.  Also a presentation of the old educated/intelligent life vrs. limited exposure and ignorane.  Worth a watch.,1271548800,2,288,5.5
4719334,5,B002AGGJ98,"I saw this screened for over a thousand middle and high school students during the Sundance Film Festival. A foreign film in another language (with English subtitles) might invite trouble among that many energetic kids, but it absolutely captured their attention. There was a lot of excited, positive chatter as they left the theater. It works for people of all ages. Captain Abu Raed is a treat for anyone who enjoys insight into other cultures, a combination of emotions, and a meaningful story. This international educator gives it five stars plus.",1263254400,22,551,5.065934065934066

4719336,5,B002AGGJ98,"I saw this Jordanian film over a year ago at a film festival, and have recommended it to many people since then. Until now, it has not been available to the general public, so I'm delighted to see I can now get my hands on a copy. A wonderful and poignant film by up-and-coming director Amin Matalqa. It's won prizes at a number of film festivals for its director and the two lead actors. Looking forward to more by him!",1263168000,4,420,4.2625
4719337,5,B002AGGJ98,"I saw this movie originally at Sundance, where it won the Audience Award.

4719338,5,B002AGGJ98,"This beautifully shot film gives an alternate cinematic perspective of the Arab world.  No mention is made of Israel or other wars in neighboring countries.  Instead it focuses on the individuals that live in the ancient city of Amman doing the best they can; their strengths, weaknesses, sorrow and humanity.  It is far from a feel good story, but it did leave a warmth inside. The acting, production values and cinematography are world class, a film for the ages.",1262736000,2,465,4.860759493670886
4719339,5,B002AGGJ98,"This is the first feature film from Jordan.  It is a beautiful story that could be set in any land and in any time.  Each character is real and identifible.  The story will make you laugh and cry and have you on the edge of your seat.  The music is woven into the story with a beautiful, light touch by Austin Wintory.  The soundtrack is wonderful on it's own, which I also recommend purchasing. This is not a political movie.  It is about love and loss and finding purpose in life.  The touching tale will give you faith in your fellow man and take you away to a land most people have never seen.  If you want to be entertained and come away with a renewned sense of an emotional connection to the people in your life, this is your movie.",1262736000,2,739,4.191489361702128

Even though Abu Raed could not help his own son and wife in the end, after their demise, he is able to help others around him and help a neighbors wife and children even though it takes an ultimate sacrifice.  This film has its sad moments but so does life and which makes its plot all the more clear.",1486252800,,391,4.342465753424658

8477399,5,B002AGGJ98,"This is a really lovely film offering a rare glimpse into life in Amman, Jordan. Nadim Sawalha, acting as Captain Abu Raed, had never held a primary role in a film before but he surely turned in the role of a lifetime. Abu Raed is a sad, widowed man who spends his days working as a janitor at the airport, and his evenings reading from his huge library. When he finds a pilot's cap in the trash can at the airport, he dusts it off and starts to wear it. The children in his impoverished neighborhood thought that he must be a pilot, and though he denied it, they dubbed him ""Captain"". He started telling stories of his travels to the rapt audience of the local kids, allowing them to expand their horizons and imaginations. The scenes with Abu Raed and the laughing children on one of the highest hills in Amman featuring Roman ruins and known as The Citadel are full of light and laughter and golden moments.

When one of the children starts to doubt that he is really a pilot, Abu Raed does not confirm or deny it since he is enjoying being a positive influence in the lives of the children. He gives particular attention to Murad, a 13 year boy who lives next door with an abusive father and tries to encourage him to go to school each day.

Without revealing any plot spoilers, I can only say that this human drama plays out in surprising and heartfelt ways. The child actors were selected from ordinary kids in the city and had no acting experience. Most of the crew was Jordanian. Produced with a rather meager $2M budget, the results are commendable. The DVD extras about the making of the film are well worth watching. This film has inspired me to seek out other films from the Middle East.",1425254400,,1699,4.407643312101911
