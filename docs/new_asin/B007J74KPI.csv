8518235,3,B007J74KPI,"Note: This is not a review of the movie itself.  It is only a short comparison of the two known VHS copies of the movie.

I own both this screening VHS and the officially released VHS under the title Demolition Day.  Both copies start with a trailer of the movie itself and they are both a little different.  Both VHS tapes have also a completely different set movie of trailers as well.  This screening VHS has 'FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY NOT FOR RENTAL OR RESALE"" appear a total of 8 times throughout the movie for 30 seconds.  It does not contain any alternate or additional material.",1475712000,,588,4.5
