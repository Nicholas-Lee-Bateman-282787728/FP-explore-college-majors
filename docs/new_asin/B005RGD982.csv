8484255,2,B005RGD982,"I ordered this DVD ""Rainbow Island 1944"" from Amazon.com when I thought I was getting a  NEW  transfer from a print but all I got was something I did get two years ago from  Loving the Classics direct. This time it came from a co. American Morgan. Some one video taped the movie from a TV broadcast with not a good reception cut the commercials out and that is  what you get. I can not understand why Universal the owner of this movie do not release a professional DVD, unless the original elements  no longer exist were  nitrate film? this movie was shot in 3 strip Technicolor  what happened. Poor is better then none. my argument with Amazon is no one checks the quality of something that they sell I know with millions of things it is impossible. Any way it is a crime, a fun movie like this not to have a good copy to enjoy it.
I hope to get a good copy on DVD some day before I die.
