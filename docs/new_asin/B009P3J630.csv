5360305,4,B009P3J630,"This is a review on the actual product not the shows:
I ordered this dvd-r with some trepidation but was pleasantly surprised. The only issue I saw with the transfer was there was a subtle flashing from slightly brighter to slightly darker. This also occurred on Hollyrock A Bye Baby as well only less so.  The sound quality was good. No volume changes or distortions. There are no bells and whistles. No subtitles. No special features or anything like that. This is just a transfer from Vhs to Dvd. But I am not going to complain. We are finally getting an option to replace worn out Vhs tapes. If you want special features buy the series.",1363996800,16,640,4.517241379310345

5360307,3,B009P3J630,"Love the Flintstones... was really looking forward to this volume but it's a bit high priced for the small amount of cartoons you get and not all feature Frankenstein's family as main features, like I was hoping. Would be better if volume 1 and 2 were combined for the $14.99 price.",1465862400,2,282,4.549019607843137

8543510,3,B009P3J630,The Flintstones came back in the 70s and early 80s in a series of primetime specials of various running lengths. Some have Pebbles as a teen and in others she's still a baby. A kooky Addams type family also are in most episodes in addition to the other regular characters. Not as good as the 60s original but still interesting to watch.,1502323200,,336,4.435483870967742
