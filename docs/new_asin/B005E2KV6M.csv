The camera work is fantastic (rain scenes are splendid and the lighting is terrific)! The background music is a delight and stays with you long after the movie is done. The dance numbers are anywhere from decent to catchy, and the second song revolving around the three girls is creative, as each girl has her own unique tune, appropriate to characterizations. The theme song is cool and reminiscent of an 80s pop tune and has some really cool graphics.

Now as for the story? Very engaging! Some of it is unrealistic and predictable, yes, but if watched casually and for entertainment value only, it is delightful! Without spoiling too much, the movie is two episodes in one. The first segment is light and enjoyable, with lots of fun jokes and parodies. The second segment is much more serious and darker, but raises interesting questions about true love, honesty, emotions, and fallout. I thought the end was appropriate, even though being predictable and also not the ending I wanted.

What about the actors/actresses? Vishal does a decent job, funny at times and convincing at other times. However, his Karthik character has a dark side to it and sometimes you root against him, despite him being the ""hero"". The kid actor who plays the young Karthik is incredibly talented! The 3 friends are all funny comedians and I wish they had more screen time. The girls are all hot and for the most part fulfill their roles. Tanushree is the best dancer of the three and she has her moments of acting, though limited. Sarah Jane's debut is decent as well and she shows promise, but probably needs more experience and practice with lip synching for the songs. Neetu Chandra is amazing, both visually stunning and possessing impressive facial expressions and terrific acting, especially for her role! In fact, I feel like she stole the movie, and though her character, too, has a dark side, somehow, I winded up rooting for her out of the three girls. One can only wonder why Neetu doesn't get more appealing roles in the Bollywood limelight? This may have been her best performance yet!

All in all, I enjoyed the movie! Yes, it has its flaws and there are some things that could have been improved upon, but it was very entertaining, and I would like to see a sequel based on the lives of the remaining girls and their finding true love. But until that happens, I'll have to make do with TVP, and that's not such a bad thing!",1386979200,,2566,4.697777777777778
