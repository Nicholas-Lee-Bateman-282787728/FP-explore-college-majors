3729766,3,B001OCVPOI,This is an OK movie but am really looking forward to the Jerusalem Countdown. Since the titles are close I was adament about looking for the correct one but somehow got the wrong one delivered again.... hmmm. So another stocking stuffer.,1324684800,,237,4.804878048780488
3729767,1,B001OCVPOI,"This is in my opinion a poor attemp to copy the movie ""Jeruselem Countdown"" it is nothing like the left behind series, and I think you will like the Jeruselem countdown alot better.",1315872000,,181,4.515151515151516
3729768,2,B001OCVPOI,"This movie used the phrase ""In the tradition of the Omega Code and Left Behind"" on the cover to give itself some credence. I do not believe it was as good or well produced as either. Countdown: Jerusalem is about a woman reporter who is looking for her missing child during the endtimes. The president of the Europen Union has brokered a peace treaty with Israel and her enemies. He has also united the world under his authority. Israel decides to pull out of the treaty and is attacked by the international community and Jesus returns afterwards. The theology of the movie is strange as it does not include the rapture as pre, mid, or post. Israel is portrayed as Babylon to be judged and destroyed in one hour accordng tp Revelation 18:10. The movie has messed up endtime theology and in my opinion appears to be anti-semantic. The movie would lead one to believe that Isreal is the problem in the world and prevents world peace. The truth is that the Arabic countries in the Middle East have followed the Koran and thus persecuted, terrorized, and killed Jews as a result. Countdown: Jerusalem is also hard to follow and confusing in its progression and plot. Save yourself time and do not rent or buy this movie. It was also shocking for a Christian movie to have two curse words used.",1262908800,,1289,4.584415584415584
3729769,1,B001OCVPOI,"First of all, this movie has no coherent plot. It is a menagerie of unexplained, random, meaningless events tied around a confusing central character who constantly makes rash, illogical decisions. For example, the main character gets imprisoned (we're not sure by who), and then her mysterious 'friend' just walks into the cell and lets her out. So how did her friend just waltz into the prison? How did he know where she was? How did he obtain her release? None of these questions are broached. This movie consists of a string of such senseless events.

Secondly, the movie's events are not well-tracked to the Bible's description of future apocalyptic events. If you want to find an end-times scenario according to the Bible's description of how things will be, you will not find it in this movie. Anyone who wishes to make a Christian end-times movie in the 21st century needs to brush up on Islamic eschatology so they can understand that the Bible's depiction of the Antichrist matches the Hadith's depiction of the Islamic Mahdi. At least with this knowledge, Christian scriptwriters will start writing better scripts that take into account the fact that the Bible describes the Beast system coming out of the Middle East, not Europe. This movie depicts Jews getting rounded up and marked with a tattoo (yet earlier in the movie it was an Arab bad guy murderer who had this same mark). None of this matches the Bible's description of the mark of the Beast. It's just more nonsense.

Third, the movie's portrayal of Israel is just plain ignorant. For one, you won't see a blonde American woman walking by herself through Muslim areas of Jerusalem wearing a sleeveless shirt in the middle of the night (in traditional American ""hollywood movie sexy girl"" style). Americans don't realize that their habit of excessive flesh exposure offends more traditional cultures. Also, it's a flawed script that has a woman dressed in this manner (with no protection from the sun) casually walk through the desert from the Jordanian border back to Jerusalem without getting sunburned...and without needing a drink of water.

I'm longing for a Christian end-times movie that simply follows the amazing and incredible script described in the Biblical books of Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Joel, and Revelation. I have no clue why directors pass over this gem of a script for the nonsense portrayed in Countdown:Jerusalem.",1260748800,11,2407,5.027568922305765
3729770,1,B001OCVPOI,"Beyond that the movie has no biblical substance other than the one scripture on the DVD case and posted at the End of the movie. Movies Like ""Image of the Beast"" put this movie to shame. A great oppurtunity was lost to provide a meanigfull message of biblical importance.",1258329600,4,271,4.551020408163265
3729771,1,B001OCVPOI,"I got tricked into renting this movie because of the reference to Left Behind on the box cover. While the movie has some similar elements to that series such as ongoing catastrophic events, there is absolutely no attempt by the moviemakers to tie them to the actual story (such as it is). These events are instead incidental to the story of a mom trying to find her daughter.  One she's reunited, and after she runs into some shadow group who's purpose is never really explaind, the story ends.  Stay far, far away from this movie and rent/buy instead Left Behind with Kirk Cameron or the Apocalypse series.",1239408000,2,607,4.663551401869159
3729772,1,B001OCVPOI,"I just watched this movie. This movie is bad! Don't even rent or buy it! This is part of the series ""Left Behind"" It goes around the same subject about the end of the world. This movie does not show anything new.

I do not want to bore you with details about this movie. Do not waste your time watching this movie! It is so bad!!!",1237593600,2,330,4.0
3729773,1,B001OCVPOI,"Countdown Jerusalem is The Asylum and Faith Films's latest effort to cash in on the Christian market hungry for Left Behind-type movies. This time, at least the sound mixing is competent so you can hear the dialog (as opposed to The Apocalypse). Still, the writing and acting is bad (although the actors seem to be trying their best with the material they've been given) and the special effects are awful, even for a low budget movie. The story is about a TV reporter who goes to Israel to look for her missing daughter and husband. There's also an earthquake, a Middle East peace treaty, a terrorist attack, a ""New world order"", a leader who may be the Antichrist and some other supernatural events. However, all these elements never really connect into a coherent story but rather feels thrown in because they're what's to be expected from a religious end-times movie. It also doesn't seem to be based on any actual Bible prophecy (regardless of whether you believe in those or not). After 90 minutes the movie ends and the ending doesn't seem to make any sense. And of course there's a religious conversion but it seems to come out of nowhere because there's really no preaching of the Christian message. This may disappoint Christian viewers and non-Christian viewers will find the whole conversion pointless and tacked-on. ""Countdown Jerusalem"" isn't really an actual Christian end-times movie but rather a movie that mixes the elements of other movies in the genre into a big mess.

This movie is definitely not worth buying but may be worth watching on TV if you really love this genre.",1235779200,7,1593,4.835164835164835

8330383,1,B001OCVPOI,This is not from john hagees book. Unfortunatly the confusion begins because the movies have similiar titles and this one is pretty horrible. The one taken from John hagees book is called Jerusalem countdown with David ar white while this crazy film is called countdown Jerusalem. Would not reccomend this movie at all. not only is the acting pretty horrible but the movie really doesnt have much of a foundation to stand on biblically except maybe the whole peace treaty and then really things are so rushed in this movie it makes it seem like everything happens in 1 entire day. Avoid this one seriously....,1351555200,,609,4.809523809523809
