8353294,4,B0026OOBF8,"Strikingly beautiful Finnish art house 'horror' film about guilt,
religion, sin and punishment, set in the 16th century, at the end of
the Russian/Swedish war.

It's full of atmosphere, symbolism, and unanswered questions. Two
Swedish brothers/soldiers -- one intellectual, the other violent and
borderline mad -- come to a strange town where they are confronted with
eerie reminders of their sins, and of those they have killed in war.

Slow paced, but not boring. However, the underlying ideas do get
stretched a bit thin over time, and the occasional turn to horror
clichs was a little disappointing given the generally high level of
intelligence and originality.

Mention also must be made of the arresting performance by Ville
Virtanen as the violent Eerik, recalling Max Von Sydow in his prime.

Interesting enough that I would give it another look now that I
understand what its getting at, and gorgeous enough that I'll still
enjoy it, even if I'm once again left with mixed feelings about some of the
content.",1294876800,,1018,5.041666666666667
8353295,5,B0026OOBF8,"I think the film is a psychological drama about seeing. It's about looking into ourselves, and looking into others. The supposedly bad character in the film wears glasses which are not sufficient for him to see very far; he cannot see clearly very far. And his inability to see clearly in the outer world is beautifully metaphored by his unwillingness--not an inability, but an unwillingness--to see in the inner world. His brother, however, who is the ""good"" one, sees himself and his brother only too clearly. There is one scene where the good brother is standing, freshly cleaned and nude, having just come out of a pond bath. He looks fresh and new, like a beautiful baby. His brother is dirty, wrinkled, and complaining about his bad eyesight.
I know the movie is supposed to be a horror but to me, it was not. It was a character study of not one person, or two, but of us all. Because both brothers are in all of us.",1263427200,,922,4.526946107784431

Festival programmer who introduced the film thought it was one of the most interesting they had selected ( does not mean it would be the most popular but different from usual festival fare i.e. Slumdog millionare )

I thought audience didn't like it as applause was sparse but almost no one left before the Q & A and audience members were engaging the director even after the Q & A was over. Finnish director and quite open with the audience as to their views on the film - he was unpretensious, wanted their input and said he was going to discuss their reactions with those who worked on the film.  Film raised a lot of issues - what is evil, do standards change in war, what is effect on perpetrators, are some locales and cultures more susceptible, are we all capable, are we looking for redemption for our actons etc.
Film doesn't drag - explores issue using an incident in the 1595 war between Russia and Sweden. He said he wanted a more neutral incident rather than a contemporary one where we might be influenced by preconceptions about the perpetrators. The issues are the same.
I would read the reviews on the Internet Movie Database as I agreed with most of them and would just be repeating them here. Website is [...]",1247270400,3,1343,4.541322314049586
