8369006,5,B002FG9N5A,"Very good documentary. No Bob Dylan music in the film. Tells the story from early life to high school to college to New York on through until Blonde On Blonde. The documentary is stories and recollections by former acquaintances, band members, scholars, club owners, etc. I got this movie from the library. I try to get all the legitimate rock and roll stuff.",1483833600,,359,4.714285714285714

8369008,5,B002FG9N5A,"There's some good stuff in this film - some excellent contributors such as Martin Carthy, CP Lee, Derek Barker. Also, some really interesting insight into Bob's childhood, schooling and college years, and his first steps into music, which I haven't heard about before. It also goes over the early period of his career when he became such a big personality and star in both the New York folk scene and beyond.

It does look at the familiar ground of the 1966 electrified tour, but does so with some more depth than other things I've seen.

All in all, an entertaining film about this great artist, which gave me some food for thought about his origins and earlier part of his career.",1288915200,,682,4.628099173553719
8369009,2,B002FG9N5A,"While this video is interesting and has extensive interviews with Dylan's ""friends"" and former band mates in Minnesota, it's mostly a bunch of talking heads and no music by Dylan himself.",1267142400,4,187,5.064516129032258
8369010,3,B002FG9N5A,"I'll be honest... I haven't seen this, so I can't critique the DVD's content... but one look at the DVD artwork and one must wonder how accurate the documentary is when the front photo features a reversed photograph.  (At last look, I don't think Dylan was a left-handed guitarist.)",1257897600,9,282,4.755102040816326
8369011,4,B002FG9N5A,"A retitled/repackaged/reissue of ""Tales From A Golden Age"" (Chrome Dreams 2004).  Okay content, but unless a completist, second one is superfluous.",1252800000,38,147,6.0
