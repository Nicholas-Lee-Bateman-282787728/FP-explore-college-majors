4331873,1,B004DCB2CG,"A half season of GLEE on DVD...AGAIN! You tried this trick last year by releasing the first season on DVD only and then did the ENTIRE season on both DVD and BluRay. The company who releases this is just greedy because they know a lot of people will buy anything with GLEE on it. So let this review be a cautionary tale...save your money for the WHOLE season and do not waste it on this half-season, half-baked marketing scheme to pry the money away from young kids.",1292976000,28,466,4.367816091954023
4331874,3,B004DCB2CG,"""Glee"" unexpectedly took the TV and music scene by storm following its debut in 2009, and by the end of the first season it was a multimedia juggernaut (and is poised to expand further).  Anticipation for its return reached a fever pitch over the summer, with people wondering where it would go, and whether it would become a victim of its own success - the answer is, a little bit.  The first ten episodes of the season have plenty of strengths compared to the first season, but also many of the same weaknesses, and others that the first season (particularly the first half) didn't have.  As an aside, one can debate the merits of whether you want to buy the season in volumes or as a whole, but it's fairly upfront about the choice, so I don't see the reason to base a review around that.  You can decide for yourself whether you want the set now or want to wait until summer of next year for the whole thing.  Spoilers thing.

The first volume consists of ten episodes, from ""Audition"", the season premiere, to ""A Very Glee Christmas"", obviously the Christmas episode.  The ninth and penultimate episode is Sectionals, the first of the three competitions that New Directions will face in the course of the year (after that, Regionals, and then, Nationals).  Two of these ten are ""theme"" episodes focussed on, respectively, Britney Spears music and ""The Rocky Horror Show"" (and its film adaptation, ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""), while another is more or less built around a guest appearance from Gwyneth Paltrow.  There has been some debate in the fandom about whether the season is being dragged down by an overabundance of themed stuff, but I would, on the whole, say no - this ratio is far from unworkable (and supposedly the rest of the season will have less of this).  And, episode to episode, the show is operating at a level of quality similar to last year.  The problems are derived in great part from the big picture, and here the producers shoot themselves in the foot on a number of occasions.

The biggest debate raging in the media and fandom about ""Glee"" at the moment is about Kurt (Chris Colfer):  Kurt is probably the show's breakout character, and certainly the one with the highest degree of social relevance.  The complaints have been multiplying lately about whether Kurt is taking over the show to the detriment of everyone else.  With rare exception, I would again say no - the amount of screentime Kurt is getting is not that out of line with what would be due a major story (and what he got last year).  The other characters, for the most part, don't suffer from a lack of screentime - indeed, the show is actually doing a better job of dividing screentime and songs this year than last year (though a few characters, most notably Mercedes, suffer from this).  Where the writers are actually failing, and why this creates a mistaken perception about Kurt's relative amount of screentime, is in dividing story.  Simply put:  Kurt has a story this year, and, in practice, nobody else does.  Kurt has a storyline with continuity that develops from episode-to-episode, and the other characters have nothing remotely like this.  Most of them could at best be said to be ""dating"" somebody, which in practice amounts to sitting next to them in class and singing together in duets; there are no substantial plots other than Kurt's.  This is particularly marked in the case of Rachel, who used to be the lead character but for most of these episodes could be best described as ""Finn's girlfriend"".  Indeed, none of the girls of ND have any story this year beyond dating one of the guys (Mercedes and Santana aren't dating anyone, that's true, but then, they also have no story).  The producers need to start giving everyone else the level of plot and character continuity they give Kurt.

It didn't have to be this way.  Indeed, ""Audition"" seems to set up a number of plots that would cover most of the cast, and from pre-season interviews, these were intended to be storylines.  However, in what can only be called spectacularly shoddy writing, these all vanish within an episode or two.  For instance, creator Ryan Murphy said that Quinn (Dianna Agron) and Santana's (Naya Rivera) story this year was going to be a rivalry over who would be the #1 girl at the school; the first episode has Quinn betray Santana to take back her old spot, leading to a physical fight.  Okay, promising start.  And that's all we ever see of it.  This supposed storyline vanishes without a trace, leaving Quinn to spend the rest of the time dating Sam and Santana, well, doing nothing beyond supplying her usual biting one-liners.  There's a truly baffling about-face with the supposed Artie/Tina/Mike triangle, where Artie suddenly decides he wants to date Brittany between episodes, despite ""Duets"" ending with him saying he loved Tina - ""Duets"" also finally gives some actual seriousness to Santana and Brittany's hinted-at relationship, but subsequent episodes totally drop this too in favour of Artie and Brittany hooking up, with Artie's feelings for Tina and Santana's jealousy seemingly forgotten (that a show that markets itself as very gay-friendly continues to treat the idea of female homosexuality as a silly joke is rather disheartening).  I would have thought that having a full season (indeed, two full seasons) commitment from the network would have allowed the creators to plan things out, but if anything the show is less coherent then ever when viewed as a season-long narrative.

So, negativity aside, what does work?  Well, first and foremost, the cast of ""Glee"" remains utterly amazing; even when the writers fall down, they manage to make the show much more coherent than it frequently deserves to be.  Several castmembers get additional spotlight here:  apart from the aforementioned Colfer/Kurt, Heather Morris/Brittany continues to become more important to the show, including her own episode (which was somewhat controversial, with a lot of people hating it for its lack of plot, but I enjoy fluff every now and then, and it was well-done fluff); Morris and Naya Rivera/Santana are now series regulars, and they make the most of their additional screentime.  Rivera, in particular, is rapidly ascending the ranks of the show's main vocalists, delivering two duets and two solo songs in the course of the year, and doing amazing on all of them.  Poor Jenna Ushkowitz/Tina, so frequently ignored despite being an original castmember, also gets more to do here, both singing and dancing (her ""Dog Days Are Over"" is fantastic, and she and Harry Shum, Jr./Mike do a terrific duet of ""Sing!"") - though they still really need to define who her character is and what her role on the show is.  And the writing, while narratively flawed, still has plenty of bite, delivering an onslaught of quotable lines and memorable moments.

If the writers could bring some order to all this and write actual stories and consistent character development for people other than Kurt, the show would be absolutely unmatched on TV.  As it is, it's messy and fun, but frustrating given how easily it could be much better if the writers put the effort in.",1292889600,83,7160,4.8400328137817885
4331875,1,B004DCB2CG,"Up front, know that I love this show, but the fragile joy, innocence and vulnerability highlighted on the show is ruined by the marketing tactics that have resulted since its success.  It manages to dampen my enthusiasm for the show itself, and that sucks.  Can you imagine, for example, if ""Season 1, Volume 2"" had been offered at a fair price to the thousands of folks who bought ""Season 1, Volume 1?""  Good energy between creators and fans creates more loyalty and success in the long run.  Instead you find yourself paying nearly twice as much as those who just waited for ""The Complete Season.""  Penalizing those who buy ""Part One"" of each season and making them feel like Losers when the complete season is released at roughly the same price as Volume 1 sucks.  It will bite you in the butt down the road, and you'll wish you'd treated fans with more respect.",1292889600,16,865,4.584415584415584
4331876,1,B004DCB2CG,Are they kidding us with this price?  You can get the full season one for less than this and this set only contains 10 episodes.  They are really gouging the fans and I'm sick of it.,1292889600,35,182,4.027777777777778
4331877,3,B004DCB2CG,"Yeah, ""Glee"" has definitely set the standards for quality television. A teen show, nonetheless entertaining, with sexy story lines, style, and--of course--singing! Here are a few issues I have with the release of this video:

1. It is rushed. Unlike the ""Season One - Vol. One"" DVD released in late December 2009, this DVD has yet to assemble a decent fight in the ring with its predecessor. The first thirteen episodes of ""Glee"" were flawless--and I mean FLAWLESS, but the second season lacks believability. Not only are the characters becoming repetitive and shallow, the new characters (or characters we have grown to love) are not as enticing. Sue is hardly seen anymore, now with Sam (portrayed by Chord Overstreet) and Beiste (portrayed by Dot-Marie Jones) coming in, gradually stealing the spotlight. On the other hand, characters who hardly ever talked are speaking for the very first time, in sentences (Mike Chang)!

2. We know the drill, get to Nationals. Okay, so who cares about Finchel, Furt, Puckleberry, St. Berry, or whatever anymore? I want interaction between the parents--people who we hardly ever (or never) see. Where are Rachel's two gay dads, Artie's parents, or Puck's long-lost older brother who so happens to be a vocalist? There are too many circles, and I know that I am not the only one getting dizzy.

3. Don't put anymore money into these bastards' pockets. Wait until the full DVD is released in August/September. Like most of you, I purchased the Vol. One DVD from the first season, which is awesome, nonetheless--but, it is, however, a rip-off if they plan to release the entire season for the same price as the second volume (which previously happened). I never ended up getting the second volume because a.) I already saw the episodes and b.) it was a ridiculous attempt to make some money. You would be better off going to third-party websites like Hulu.com to watch the five trailing episodes and more. Trust me, this will get you by until the hiatus is over. You know you watched these episodes religiously anyway, so why pay for what you know?

The season, for me, has a ""C+"" rating. The original rating for me would be a ""C-"", but Kurt's bullying saga kind of made me realize why I started watching the show again. Gwen's episode, is also really great. The episodes are so-so, not too many great moments, but plenty of one-liners by Sue (which gives me the chills and chuckles).

If you are thinking about getting the DVD, don't. It will be September in no time, and you can actually enjoy them all simultaneously. Take a true Gleek's advice.

We have, in this boxed-set:

10 episodes, with two themed-shows, featuring music from pop-singer Britney Spears and the cult-classic musical ""Rocky Horror"".

Sure the DVD has plenty of extras and what not, but just think with your pennies before you Glee-gasm.

4331878,4,B004DCB2CG,"Oh boy, there is a LOT to say about this season so far. I think I will do it episode by episode.

Episode 1 (Auditions) - After a 3 month wait (for those of you who are Gleeks, this was unbearably long), we finally got the show back, with some new things in store. Basically following the model of Season 1's first episode, it was the introduction of several new characters as well as a recap as to where we left all of our favorite cast members in June. Charice, Sam and The Beast are all introduced as new stars of the show. (On a side note, WHERE IS CHARICE?! she never re-appears in any of the episodes!). Good starter 4.5/5

Episode 2 (Britney/Brittany) - The episode that EVERYONE was waiting for & that was announced before the 1st season had even ended, the Britney episode. As excited as I was to see this one, I was a little disappointed and here's why:
- Britney, although in the episode, has VERY short cameos and only in the kids fantasies....was expecting more action from her
- The story line was super shoddy and was basically only about the performances (though the performances were all amazing)
- Sue, for the first time in the history of the show, was completely unnecessary this episode; she basically did nothing
- Kurt complained the ENTIRE episode about getting a song, and never got to perform. What was the point of all that whining then?
Overall, this episode, performances aside, was very half-baked...disappointed 2.5/5

Episode 3 (Grilled Cheesus) - I REALLY liked this episode. Finn sees a resemblance of Jesus in a burnt grilled cheese sandwich and think he has seen Christ, which is brought to the whole crew's attention. Meanwhile, Kurt's father has a heart attack and becomes comatose, which only adds more fuel to the religious fire. The opposing religious views (Judaism, Christianity (diff degrees of it), and Atheism) were handled VERY smartly in this episode without offending anyone or trying to convert. Also, Kurt delivers one of his best performances to date. 5/5

Episode 4 (Duets) - Puck is sent to juvie, Sam is introduced as a major character of the show, a love triangle between Tina, Artie, and Mike (other Asian) is formed, and Brittany & Santana's relationship is tested. Another very good episode as many of the minor characters of the show finally get some speaking room. Speculations arise of Brittany and Santana's sexuality (though, it's more Santana I believe, as she seems to prey on Brittany's ignorance for her own gain), Tina and Artie are also brought to the forefront this episode as they are very seldom spoken of. Mike FINALLY speaks for the first time....in well...ever, and Sam becomes Quinn's new love interest. 4/5

Episode 5 (The Rocky Horror Glee Show) - There is not a ton to say about this episode really...the cast basically tries to recreate a PG-13 version of the movie of the same name all because Will wants to win over Emma from John Stamos. I can't quite put my finger on it, but Will Schuster has become very annoying this season....something about him is getting very irritable. The performances are watered-down to be safe for younger audiences and they really should have had Kurt replace Mercedes as the transvestite. 2.5/5

Episode 6 (Never Been Kissed) - Will separates the group for another mash-up competition. Kurt, tired of being harassed by Karofsky, spies for New Directions at Dalton Academy, where he meets Blaine (Darren Criss) who encourages Kurt to stand up for himself. Coach Beiste discovers the boys use her as a turn-off method and attempts to quit her job. Puck returns and develops a friendship with Artie through his community service project.  Puck returns to his expected role; the tough looking-guy who acts like a douche, feels bad about it later on, and makes up for it with his tough guy act. I really only liked this part of the story because Artie gets more screen-time. Beast gets more story with being use by Sam, Mike and Tina (which was hilarious) as a way not to get past first base & announcing that she is not only a virgin but, like the title says, never been kissed...the interaction between her and Will is sweet and paves the way for more great Beastliness. Of course though, the best part is, we find out that Kurt's bully Karofsky is also gay (a little cliche in real life, but makes for a great twist in the show) and the character Blaine is introduced. I don't think he will be a love interest, but simply a mentor and very close friend.....I can tell this Karofsky bit is far from over. 4.5/5

Episode 7 (The Substitute) Will becomes ill, and is replaced by substitute teacher Holly Holliday (guest star Gwyneth Paltrow). Meanwhile, Sue takes over as principal when Figgins also takes ill, and flexes her power on campus. Will is removed from a major part of the episode (thank god), and an AMAZING Gwenyth Paltrow takes over as a do-what-makes-you-happiest type teacher. Also, Sue as Principal was rather hilarious as she finally makes a much-needed comeback as a large antagonist as opposed to just be annoying every now and then. Mercedes also takes a stance against Sue as she removes tater-tots from the school, which is later revealed to be a way to make-up for losing a grip on Kurt's friendship as he grows closer to Blaine. A wonderful episode, I really hope Gwenyth comes back, she was a great addition. 5/5

Episode 8 (Furt) Sue's Nazi-hunting mother Doris Sylvester (Carol Burnett) pays her a visit due to her upcoming wedding to herself, Finn and Kurt face the marriage of their parents, and the administration takes a stand against Karofsky which leads to Kurt leaving McKinley High. Carol Burnett does an OUTSTANDING job as Sue's mother as her cynicism and overall mean-spiritedness is believable (both her and Jane look eerily alike). Kurt and Finn's parents finally tie the knot as their relationship was largely teased in the first season in a very nice wedding reception. This is also the last episode (so far) where Kurt is a student at McKinley as the harassment from Karofsky becomes too much for Kurt to handle. It's a sad departure, but you know he will be back; they wouldn't cut out such an essential character. 4/5

Episode 9 (Special Education) - A whole lot of nothing this episode really. Kurt settles into Dalton Academy only to learn that standing out as he had done in McKinley won't work at his new school, Rachel finds out that Finn lost his virginity to Santana & they break up (it took her a year to figure it out? Really?), Carl and Emma get married off-screen, Suspicion of Brittany cheating on Artie arises but is proven to be nothing as she was only doing so to hide the fact that she lost Artie's lucky comb (which turns out to be a random comb he found on the floor seconds before giving it to her), and the fat girl who previously cameos in other episodes becomes Kurt's replacement. Oh, and Sectionals happen which new Directions wins (of course), but it really seems like the side story of this episode as everything else is somehow put first. Unfulfilling episode that is simply meant to tie you over until February as this is really the last episode of the season, since the next is a Christmas special. Could have been a lot better 3/5

Episode 10 (A Very Glee Christmas) - Not meant to add a ton to the story, but rather works more effectively as a stand-alone episode. This episode mostly played upon a reworking of The Grinch (which is played by Sue). Basically what happens is Sue plays The Grinch, steals everyone's presents for herself, Will and The Beast take them back, but Sue (again, like The Grinch) steals them all back, and in the process, destroys the entire Glee Club room. At first, New Directions is hurt by this, but soon, let's it go by learning the true meaning of Christmas; being together for the holidays. This effects Sue so much, that she invites the whole Glee club over to Will's house for the holidays so he doesn't spend Christmas alone. The secondary story is that Brittany still believes in Santa, which worries the other cast members as none of them believe. so they attempt to tell her lightly through a few different scenarios; all of which backfire until they hire the Beast to pretend to be Santa, where she tells Brittany that she cannot fulfill her wish of having Artie walk again...until a pair of mobility walkers are found in the choir room which allow him to walk with forearm crutches...restoring both Brittany and everyone else's faith in Santa. The minor stories of this episode are that Rachel tries to rekindle her flame with Finn, but it backfires and he officially ends their relationship. Kurt gets a cameo moment with Blaine as they perform the best song of the whole episode together and we see that Kurt has actually fallen for Blaine. Too short for my liking but effectively leaves you wanting more in 2011.

Overall, this has been an above average return to the first season. It isn't QUITE as good (so far), but it's extremely close.
Pros:
--Minor and new characters from previous season are getting a lot more attention (Tina, Artie, Mike, Brittany, Santana, Sam, Beast)
--Kurt's story becomes more believable & filled out and less flashy and predatory than he was before (with Finn).
--Will, Rachel & Finn finally aren't the main focus of everything going on
--Sue, though still the main antagonist, has become more three-dimensional as opposed to just completely cruel all the time
--Songs are more of a mix of older and newer, whereas in the beginning it was mostly older music to draw in older viewers

Cons:
--The themed episodes (Britney, Rocky) fall flat and come of as very rushed. Notably, Ryan Murphy (who is the show's co-creator) has done all of the musician-themed shows (with the exception of the Gaga/KISS episode). He needs to stay away from these as he does very poorly when executing the portrayal of the storylines for these episodes
--Too many 2 week breaks! The first season had 13 episodes before it went away until the next year; this season had 10 (9 really, as I don't count holiday specials). Suspense is nice every once in a while but not necessary for every episode.
-- As I stated earlier, Will has become very annoying...I think maybe it is because he comes across as going through a midlife crisis. He tries to be both the authority figure and cool at the same time, which just doesn't work for him. Also, he can be very over-dramatic at times (which, yes, I know he is a Broadway actor in real life and that Rachel is also this way, but it works on Rachel because she is overdramatic and well, at times a b****, whereas Will just is for no reason). Finn has also gotten sort of irritating...I'm getting sick of his naive, everything-is-harder-on-me routine. It was cute the first season, but not anymore.
--Lastly, Mike, Quinn, and Puck need a bigger emphasis. Though Mike got to shine for the first time in ""Duets"", it has been basically the only time all season (apart from ""Make'em Laugh"" with Will). Quinn, who was one of the biggest characters of the first season, has almost completely been put on the back burner this season. She hardly ever says a word unless it's something to do with Sam. She is practically this season's Mike. Then there's Puck who, once the biggest man-threat on the show has been completely wussified and also, almost completely void of characterization. All that's happened to him this season is he went to juvie a couple of episodes, came back, and that was pretty much it. Maybe they have more in store for these 3 in 2011, but until then I'm a little unhappy with this.

First, I love ""Glee,"" and don't completely begrudge them releasing a half-season to DVD.  I was a latecomer, and wouldn't have been able to catch up to the show easily if they hadn't done the same thing with the first season.

This set includes the first several episodes of the second season, beginning with ""Audition.""  The show  is not a great premiere, going through the motions in terms of exposition to set up a feud.  The songs for the premiere are exceptional, from Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind"" to Travie McCoy's ""Billionaire,"" everything works musically.  Chord Overstreet's Sam Evans is introduced, and has been a mostly welcome addition.  But, the more intriguing Charice, as Sunshine Corazon, has not been seen or even referenced since.  Dot-Marie Jones has been a blast as McKinley High's new football coach.

Standout episodes are ""Grilled Cheesus"", ""Furt"",(a great episode exploring the relationship between Chris Colfer's Kurt Hummel and Cory Monteith's Finn Hudson) ""A Very Glee Christmas"", and ""The Substitute,"" the first of several episodes guest-starring Gwyneth Paltrow.

I think ""Glee"" is phenomenal, but the decision of whether or not to buy a half-season is an individual one.  In terms of episode quality, this is a good set.",1300320000,2,1269,5.166666666666667

4331910,2,B004DCB2CG,"Like many others, I enjoyed (half of) Season One. That half would be the first half of course. It was something new and fresh, it spoke to people in many ways, and thespians and people of all sex, race, sexual orientation were united. Even my dad loves it too. So of course, imagine my surprise upon finding out I had to wait half a year for new episodes. Then April 2010 came, and Hell-O was pretty good... but the rest of the season wasn't. Yes, I am one of those people who thought the show just stopped being good halfay into Season 1. It's like they got completely new and inexperienced writers. That, and Season 2 follows in the footsteps of Season 1 part 2.

First off, it's easy to see they've gotten new crew, because the show has a dull, monotone and almost completely flat look to it now. Whereas Season One was nice and colorful, Season 2 has mostly muted colors and looks more like something out of a Bourne movie. That, and the shaky Camera is even worse here. Sure there was some shaky camera in season one, but it was used very sparingly. Here, it's even used in some musical numbers, and at times it's hard to understand what's going on. It does not feel documentarian, it feels like a man with Parkinsons filmed it. Back on the subject of the colour pallette, I do get it takes place during winter in some scenes, but so did Season 1 and there it looked like they put actual visual thought into it.

I have only been satisfied by a handful of episodes. Despite what a lot of people said, I thought Audition was a fantastic episode and a great start. Telephone was quirky and funny, and I thought it set the tone for a good rest of the season. Never Been Kissed is an excellent episode too, and Chris Colfer really shows how good he can acthere, as the conflict levels are high, and it's like Season one of Glee. Furt is cool too, and A Very Glee Christmas was in a word, AMAZING. I actually shed a few tears at the end because it really makes you realize the true meaning of christmas. It was very reminiscent of season one, and on the mark.

The rest is all either garbage or a severe missed opportunity. There was absolutely no reason for the Britney episode, although it was worth it for Heather Morris' dancing. The Rocky Horror episode was a complete missed opportunity, it was almost like a parody of RH. Duets was pointless, Grilled Cheesus was boring and full of Melodrama, Special Education was some of the worst crap I've ever seen WITH the most obvious autotune in the world on Time of my Life. Worst of all was The Substitute. I love Gwenyth Paltrow, but that episode just stunk out loud. Garbage plot, pointless appearance by Paltrow, plus Forget You was AWFUL!!!!!!

In short, as of writing, I have seen what there is so far of Part 2, and it is getting better. I liked Comeback and LOVED Silly Love Songs, but Sue Sylvester Shuffle was a total disaster- why are they dressed as zombies and doing Thriller? Otherwise, I can't recommend the season if the rest of the season looks to be like this half of Season 2.",1297814400,2,3044,4.391843971631205
4331911,4,B004DCB2CG,"As usual the vocal talents on this show are amazing.  2 new characters have been introduced this year:  Sam a transfer student with really amazing vocal skills, and Blaine (hopefully Kurt's future boyfriend) who is the most talented singer on this show hands down.  This season started off kind of rocky with some episodes (like the Brittany Spears one) that didn't make a bit of sense.  This episode alone almost made me stop watching the show.  There was a very good episode at the beginning that had one of the New Directions gone and they had to all stumble around looking for a replacement, this was when Sam came into the fold.  There was a very talented Asian girl singer that tried out and was amazing, but Rachael stabbed her in the back and she left the school.  This was typical for the Rachael introduced in the first season (remind me now why anyone would want to be friends with this egomaniac?).  The total breakout and redemption of this season is the ongoing story of Kurt.  Finally a gay kid actually going through what gay kids actually go through, not the hollywood glitz and glamour they like to show in movies and TV.  Kurt goes through bullying, finding someone he is obviously in love with, being hit on by the bully harassing him, and leaving his New Direction teammates.  This is more true to life than I have seen on this show before.  Another let down episode was the Rocky Horror themed episode.  Really Mercedes playing Dr. Frankenfurter?  She ruined the part with her ""I wanna be Mariah Carey Diva"" attitude.  Changing the words to the classic Sweet Transvestite to ""sensational transylvania"" made even worse what was already ruined.  Sam finally taking some of the male vocal leads away from Finn who doesn't always have the range to sing the leads has helped me like the music portion of this season better.  Kurt's story and the introduction of Blaine has kept me coming back for more.",1297468800,3,1919,4.663690476190476
4331912,4,B004DCB2CG,"It is no question whatsoever that ""Glee"" was and is one of the most surprising and random television hits in recent years. It literally came out of nowhere and single-handedly took over not only popular TV, but the iTunes charts as well. The stars were hurtled headfirst into the limelight and all became instant icons in the entertainment business. After an absolutely insane first season chock-full of hit CD and DVD releases, a sold-out select-city concert tour, and spots on nearly every gossip magazine cover in the country, ""Glee"" was indeed an huge instant success. Despite its extreme popularity in every aspect of the word, many doubted whether or not it would be able to keep shining in the years to come. Now, ""Glee"" has been back with its sophomore season for a while now- did it live up to its predecessor? Basically.
Season Two of ""Glee"" is an extremely disgruntled mix of completely brilliant episodes with memorable dialogue and nail-biting drama, as well as a few really, really crappy episodes that are truly not at all memorable.",1296950400,2,1048,4.893258426966292
4331913,4,B004DCB2CG,"10 Episodes on 3 Discs, released January 25, 2011

Ten episodes on three discs feels like they are really milking this one, but I can't blame them for scheduling the act break right after the Christmas episode. Just when I was about ready to give up on ""Glee"", it went and got pretty good again. The first few episodes of the second season in my opinion were lackluster. The old plot lines seemed to fizzle out, Mr. Schuester (Matthew Morrison) was trying to steal guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) from the hot dentist played by John Stamos, and the theme episodes were starting to get out of control. I didn't care about the characters anymore. The Britney episode was very funny, but didn't tell a story anymore, it was just silly excuses for song & dance numbers. After watching all of Season One and the first four episodes of Season Two, I quit ""Glee"", certain I wouldn't return.

Then a major turnaround occurred after the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" theme episode. Kurt (Chris Colfer) was put in a major arc about gays being bullied and we were introduced to a new love interest for him, Blaine (Darren Criss). Kurt and Finn (Cory Monteith) became brothers when their parents were married in a very emotional episode. Embracing stories around Kurt was a big plus for this show. He is one of the most real feeling and emotional characters on the show as we can tell by Chris Colfer's recent Golden Globe win. New cast member, Darren Criss has that crossover appeal to men and women and a pretty amazing voice (then again, which cast member doesn't have a great voice?). It doesn't take as long to get to Sectionals as it did before and it isn't the center of the Glee universe anymore. We aren't using every single episode as an excuse to have a song we ""might"" use for Sectionals. Bigger issues are in play with relationships between students and Kurt transferring to another school.

Also there was a big plus of a few episodes of Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) as Principal of the school and she curbs her own bullying to help stop the bullying of others, including guest star Carol Burnett who plays Sue's mother. Another big guest star was Britney Spears during the Britney-themed episode which was pretty exciting. Also Gwyneth Paltrow guest-starred as a substitute teacher when Schuester was sick to let the kids have more say in their musical selection so they weren't all ""50 years old"" or Journey songs.

One of my favorite new characters is Coach Beiste played by Dot Jones. This woman in real life is a 15 time World and 10 time National arm-wrestling champion and is a real beast of a woman with a heart of gold. Her character is so shy and sweet and she is just as much of an outcast as the Glee club members. After the ""Never Been Kissed"" and Christmas episodes (LOVED the whole Christmas episode), I am hooked on her.

So just as it garnered so much enthusiasm last year, it's worth holding on for this year, give ""Glee"" a chance. It will more often warm your heart than make you roll your eyes.

Bonus Features:

As with Season 1, there is a Glee music jukebox where you can set up a shuffle rotation of music from the second season to keep you company at a party or whatever. In ""Getting Waxed with Jane Lynch"", you get to watch the character of Sue Sylvester getting immortalized as a wax sculpture. Letting her talk at any time is a good idea and the anatomy of making a wax sculpture and all the measurements is more interesting than I thought it'd be. ""The Wit of Brittany"" is just a ton of great quotes looped together demonstrating her intelligence. Her one-liners are the funniest part of the show outside of Jane Lynch. You can also see Glee at Comic-Con! Wow, I knew nerds cheered for superheros a lot at these, never thought I'd see ""Glee"" as a part of Comic-Con, the people LOVE them. Chris Colfer pulled the smart move by wearing a Transformers Decepticon icon t-shirt. If you like listening to people scream after every sentence people say, this is the extra for you. It's a little dated because they talk about things they want to do that they end up doing during this season.

If you needed more ""Rocky Horror"", there is an exclusive bonus song that didn't make it to the show -- ""Planet, Schmanet, Janet"". Pretty glad they cut this since it's the same thing as the actual opening to the episode - a pair of lips singing with a black background. Big let down and boring to watch, thankfully short. The one they chose was much better. You can also watch the making of ""The Rocky Horror Glee Show"". It makes me wish they had done a making of special for the Britney themed episode which is what I originally thought ""The Wit of Brittany"" might have been. It would have been cool to see Britney Spears on the set working with the actors and seeing the choreography and recreating music video moments.",1296691200,4,4846,4.549311926605505
4331914,4,B004DCB2CG,"It's still tongue-in-cheek. It's still over-the-top. It's still shockingly addictive, and - me, being a manly man - I'm still mortified that I'm hooked on GLEE (I cringe like a mother every time I hear the label ""gleek""). Anyway, our teen bunch of outcasts and outsiders return to McKingley High for another season of glee club shenanigans, ridiculous angst, and facial slushies. Big dreamer that he is, Will Schuester, the glee club director, has set his eyes on the Nationals which, this year, is taking place in New York (and so, right away, we get a neat rendition of Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind""). However, budget cuts all around hamstring not only the glee club but also Sue Sylvester's cheerleading squad. This treats us to an unholy alliance between Mr. Shoe and Sue Sylvester, especially since the new - and scary - football coach threatens to muck things up for them both.

The musical performances are what draw us in, but there's no escaping those high school romances. In these ten episodes, we see familiar couples and new pairings, some of them really unexpected (some of them brought about by poor writing). Mr. Shoe is still chasing the school's chaste guidance counselor, Emma Pillsbury, except that Emma is now dating a handsome devil of a dentist (John Stamos, in a recurring role) and, shockingly, she isn't as much of a neat freak, what with the cool dentist gradually weaning her off her phobias. And, yes, for good or evil, John Stamos gets to sing a number.

Folks depart, folks arrive. New Directions get new members, one of them a jock eerily resembling McCauley Culkin. New Directions also lose two members, one of whom is a key contributor. Rachel Berry (Lea Michelle), last season's most prominent character, takes more of a back seat this season as the less-featured of the cast are showcased. To demonstrate how huge this show's blown up, even more marquee names grace the guest star roster. The show devotes an episode to Britney Spears and features a cameo by Britney herself (and also gives ditzy Brittany more camera time). And maybe you can twig onto why Sue Sylvester is the way she is when you learn that her parents neglected her childhood to go hunt Nazis. Carol Burnett storms in as Sue's mother. Meat Loaf and Barry Bostwick cameo in GLEE's homage to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, an episode which also features Emma Pillsbury performing ""Touch-a, Touch-a Touch Me,"" which was Jayma May's original audition piece for the series. And in probably my favorite episode of the season so far, ""The Substitute"" has Gwyneth Paltrow brilliantly subbing for an ailing Mr. Shoe in his Spanish and glee club classes (and we also get the awesome mash-up song ""Umbrella/Singin' In The Rain""). Meanwhile, Filipino singing sensation Charice shows up in the first episode and promptly makes Rachel nervous with her big voice. Charice's character's audition piece (""Listen"") for the glee club blows the roof off.

And one of my favorite shticks resurfaces with the episode ""Duets,"" which again pits the boys against the girls. ""Duets"" gives us Amber & Santana getting their R&B on with ""River Deep - Mountain High"" and Mike Chang & Tina's cute interpretation of ""Sing!"" Yes, Mike Chang sings. Sort of.

Two things to nitpick: One, the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" number in ""The Substitute"" didn't work for me, probably because I'm biased for the Donald O'Connor original, and you'd have to do something really amazing to top that or even match it. Two, I was disappointed that Amber played Frank-N-Furter in ""Rocky Horror Glee Show."" I guess the series didn't want to rock the boat, but it would've been crazy cool if Finn or Carl (Stamos) or one of the other guys had played the part. I guess Kurt would've been too obvious.

Jane Lynch is awesome, end of discussion. And it's cool to catch up with the GLEE cast. But the writing's been a shade off so far (S. Curley's review covers a lot of the inconsistencies). But give the show some due, GLEE also isn't shy about addressing topical issues, here and there. One example, The ""Rocky Horror Glee Show"" demonstrates that even guys get concerned with their body image. And is that a whiff of satire I sense regarding Asian tokenism? GLEE has also been consistent with showcasing Kurt Hummel, an openly gay glee club member. Somewhere in all the quirkiness and romantic musical chairs and high school politics, there are some truly moving moments. The wedding vow so honestly stated by Kurt's dad to his bride in ""Furt,"" that'll turn a rock into a puddle. There are also some very nice moments with the football coach who is more sympathetic than you'd first think.

I'm actually not cheesed at this DVD release. Sometimes, a whole season's worth is simply too long to wait on. As someone said on this site, I work crazy hours and don't own a TIVO or DVR. So no complaints from me this time. Ten episodes ain't nothing to sneeze at. I tend to get my feelings more hurt when a DVD's only offering, say, four episodes a pop.

GLEE Season 2, Vol. 1 has the first ten episodes (which take New Directions all the way to the Sectionals) and these bonus features, on 3 discs: the GLEE Music Jukebox gives you direct access to the musical performances; the DVD World Premiere exclusive bonus song ""Planet, Schmanet, Janet""; The Making of the Rocky Horror GLEE Show (00:06:48 minutes); ""Getting Waxed with Jane Lynch"" - the process of creating a Madame Tussaud wax statue of Jane Lynch or, more accurately, of Sue Sylvester (00:06:09); ""The Wit of Brittany"" - a cavalcade of Brittany's best (and sometimes very non-sequitur) lines (00:02:21); and the GLEE panel (but minus the lead actors) doing Q & A at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con (00:14:54).",1296518400,2,5702,4.788617886178862
4331915,5,B004DCB2CG,"I bought this because, like many other people, I could not wait until september for the entire season.

The Box Set:
The front cover shows characters Brittany, Finn, Rachel,Satanna, and Kurt throwing slushies in front of a green background. On the left spine of the box you have the title and small pictures of Rachel and Finn. On the right side (only on the cardboard slip cover) you have Brittany and Satanna. On the back you have a sypnosis of the season (so far) and a list of various features. On the inside you have a layout of pics of the cast (mostly from ""The Rocky Horror Glee Show"" episode)a list of what's on each disc including features and such. The 3 discs are spread out into a ""story book format"" which all TV on DVD releases are nowadays.
All 3 discs are colored differently. Where is says ""Glee"" on each disc there is a ""K"" spray painted next to the word. Also, next to the ""K"" is the word ""Out!"" Making the discs say ""Gleek Out!""
Disc 1 -
On disc 1 you get episodes 1-4 of Season Two with 1 bonus feature, which is ""Glee Kareoke"". Glee Kareoke is where you can choose which song you want to listen to, and it goes straight to it on the DVD.
Disc 2 -
On disc 2 you get episodes 5-8 with a couple bonus features. Glee Music Jukebox and a never-before-aired song from ""The Rocky Horror Glee Show"" (even though it ony lasts about 1 minute long).
Disc 3 -
On disc 3 you get episodes 9 & 10 with the majority of the features. Some features include ""Getting Waxed with Jane Lynch"" and ""Glee at Comic-Con 2010.""

The Episodes:
In season two, the episodes have still been very good. The only issue about Glee: Season Two, is that instead of mostly being about Rachel, Finn, Mercedes, Tina, Artie,Puck, Will, Emma, and Sue, it's more about the minor characters: Brittany and Satanna to name a few. Also, the first half of season 2 mostly seemed to resolve around Kurt. Which is okay, but I (personally) prefer the stories about Rachel, Finn, Will, and Sue - which is what the show was originally about. An interesting thing that developed was the relationship between Artie and Brittany. It was the most unexpexted thing.

So:
Everyone, quit complaining about how there's more volume releases, becase there are a lot of people like me who can't wait until september for the entire release. If you aren't planning to buy this DVD, don't leave a review saying just that and giving it 1 star because you're unhappy. It reflects bad on the  show when you leave 1 star for absolutely no reason except to complain about how you are not buying it. This DVD set is good, and if you're a fan of ""Glee"" then you will want to buy this (but only if you don't have the patience to wait til the fall).

Thanks everyone for reading and I hope you enjoy this DVD (and that this review was helping to give you some insight to the DVD set).",1296345600,31,2832,4.376425855513308
4331916,4,B004DCB2CG,"This is such a wonderful show and certainly deserves our support. Every week, we get the equivalent of a broadway show in our homes and the entire DVD set will provide many, many hours of quality entertainment. Although I haven't yet seen the second season since I don't have live television here in the woods of Appalachia, my husband and I have really enjoyed the first season. While many people comment about the half-season releases and cost (and leave not-so-positive remarks), I am sure that it costs quite a bit of money to bring this show to us (several million dollars for some episodes, I have read).

With actors, writers, sets, costumes, locations, live musicians, etc., this show is very expensive to create, I am sure. And people are complaining about paying $20-30 to see a half season of such quality entertainment? I don't understand that. That is less than the price of one ticket to a show and we get a half season of comedy, drama, amazing musical numbers, and ground-breaking opportunities for people to view and understand characters that represent many diverse groups and individuals in our culture.

That kind of a quality production doesn't come cheap and we are so fortunate to have the opportunity to experience this at such a reasonable price. And from what I have read, this was an important season for breaking stereotypes and encouraging acceptance of others. How brave for a show to be one of the first to spotlight issues like bullying, encourage tolerance, and include characters that represent our actual population, not one televisually created by those ""in power.""

I would encourage people to purchase this set and pay retail in order to support such quality television and the people who bring it to us. If we don't honor those who give us something worthwhile, shows like this won't long exist in the production world of cut budgets, cheap sitcoms, and inane reality shows. Our support will ensure that quality programming will continue to happen. For the makers of this show, thank you for doing such a wonderful job.",1295913600,2,2058,4.891117478510028

This year I have saved the episodes on my TIVO, so I will probably wait to get the full season, but I can't believe how many people are whining over the price of 10 episodes.

4331918,1,B004DCB2CG,"Glee is a hit show for Fox and it's producers, and we are talking about show business, with the emphasis on business.  Having worked at Disneyland for almost ten years, I continually cringed every time they raised the admission prices, which put much more pressure on us castmembers to deliver, while management got worse. Get Hulu, to sign up is free and you get many more options.  Save the episodes on your DVR and then, when the season is over, and the prices drop, purchase the season dvd.  Like in all sales, the producers of Glee are cashing in on all the impulse buying that fans are prone to. Besides, many of the criticisms, I have read on this site, have to do with a lack of coherent plotlines and character development. It has been written that Ryan Murphy's plotlines became more and more bizarre in the previous series he was involved with, ""Nip and Tuck"".  I hope that the same phenomenon does not happen here.
I suffer from adult ADD and I sense the same phenomenon in Mr. Murphy and the way he acts.  While we ADDers can be highly creative, we can also be shallow when it comes to the development of relationships.  I hope that RM really seeks to listen to other talented people in his staff, rather than to rely solely on his own instincts.

When I first saw the dvds, at a local store, for season 1 I was shocked at what they were attempting to charge me, and for what I could attain the same collection for on Amazon. I believe the same thing will happen here.  Wait until the season ends, there are other ways to view the episodes of this season so far.",1295654400,7,1575,4.3883161512027495
4331919,5,B004DCB2CG,"What is with all the people complaining about a half season coming out for 20 bucks?  Firstly, businesses exist to make a profit, not to kiss your butt, so stop being so appalled and shocked when they do something that makes business sense.  Secondly, would you rather wait 6-8+ months to watch the whole of Glee at your leisure, or would you rather get half NOW and half later?  I certainly appreciate that they DON'T make you wait till filming is complete before you can start watching; I work random hours and totally overlooked recording the fist few episodes, and since I will only watch START to finish, it would make me sad if my only other option was to wait several months for the complete season.  Humans can be like petulant children when it comes to things: ""gimme now, i want it all now!  how dare you make me wait"".  Is it really too much to expect people to be content without immediate gratification, lest they go apeshiz?  I believe that both consumer and business benefit in this arrangement.

And seriously people?  You're going to rate a TV series on how many discs are in it?  Aren't reviews supposed to be more about the quality of the program?  Additionally...I just can't believe so many people are surprised that the whole season isn't included...considering that it hasn't stopped filming, that they did the same thing last time, that there's an episode preview, and that the title says ""GLEE: SEASON TWO, VOLUME ONE""...that they mention there is a volume one, and any moderately intelligent person should only assume there is, in the very least, another half.

Finally, fool you twice, shame on you...Indeed.

P.S.
Glee rocks, and all you whiners can go take a long walk off a short pier.  Be grateful that you don't have to wait until June (or whenever they release the whole season).

4331921,5,B004DCB2CG,"Glee is still going strong into it's 2nd season :-)It's a show filled with energy,great music,dancing, plot and a wonderful cast of characters. I think the new football coach that was added to the show is a treasure and a great addition to the cast. Sue Sylvester, still has me laughing out loud, what a great job she did as the Grinch in the Holiday episode. The whole cast is amazing. The only negative is this 1st half season DVD. I learned my lesson, as I purchased "" The Road to sectionals "" which was the half of season 1...it left me wanting more. Plus I also learned when the complete DVD Glee season 1 came out, it was less expensive. So , I'm going to wait, and watch it all together and save a little bit of money. I too also hope that the lower ratings weren't because of this half season, as it doesn't reflect the show in of it self. Maybe, the powers that be, should wait like every other series and wait until the end of the season, then see the ratings go up on the product...the show should speak for itself.",1294531200,3,1026,4.239795918367347

4331923,3,B004DCB2CG,"I love this show! No doubt about it. If I had all the money in the world, I would buy this right now. But after buying season 1 volume 1, then waiting and getting volume 2, I realized just how much money I was spending. I could have saved a lot if I just waited to get the full season. So you should too! You'll be saving money that could go towards something else. Just wait until the the complete season 2 comes out",1294012800,,417,3.9761904761904763
4331924,3,B004DCB2CG,"As a big Glee fan, I am sorry to say that this first half of season 2 is a little disappointing.  The first season was so well written.  When Glee season 2 started, fans were welcomed by almost plot-less and sometimes rushed filler episodes.  The episodes Grilled Cheesus, Never been Kissed, The Substitute and A Very Glee Christmas were the only really good episodes.  The rest although were fun to watch, didn't really move the plot along.  We hardly see any Emma or any Terri.
*Contains spoilers*:

Audition 6/10: Season premier could have been better.  We see Tina all of a sudden dating Mark Chang, which I personally don't like.  We meet Sunshine (who doesn't appear at all for the rest of the volume), Ms. Beiste, the new football coach and Sam, a jock.

Britney/Brittany 5/10: In the Madonna themed episode, they cooperated her songs in the story. In the Britney Spears themed episode, the kids fantasize about Britney musical numbers while at the dentist.  There was no major plot in this episode that moved the story along.  They pretty much forced the Britney songs into this episode.  And apparently, Emma is dating a dentist.

Grilled Cheesus 8/10:  The controversial theme episode about religion finally has some kind of storyline to advance with.  Kurt's dad is in the hospital and the kids all pray for him while Finn finds a grilled cheese with Jesus' face in it.

Duets 6/10: Puck all of a sudden is in juvie for some reason.  It's also time, like last season, for duets.  It has a-what-feels-like-a-forced relationship between Quinn and Sam.  The episodes ending felt rushed.

The Rocky Horror Glee Show 7/10:  This episode was really well done considering that it was directed by Adam Shankman, the director of Hairspray.  Again, this episode does nothing to the plot, just some scenes with a jealous Will and trying to win Emma's affection.

Never Been Kissed 9/10: The kids have images of the Beiste in revealing outfits to turn themselves off when they get aroused.  Meanwhile, Kurt is tired of getting harassed by a school bully so he visits a different school.  There was a nice scene in this episode where Beiste and Will kiss.  It was so sweet.  There's some character development in this episode as well.

The Substitute 9/10:  A fun episode where Gweneth Paltrow guests stars as a cool substitute while Will gets sick.  It was well done as well.

Furt 6/10:  Kurt and Finn's parents are getting married and Kurt changes school's.  This episode was nice.  It was a bit rushed at times.

Special Education 6/10: It's finally time for Sectionals, but again, like the Duet episode, they make a big deal out of Sectionals and it's something that they were waiting for so much, but when they go to Sectionals, it felt very rushed.

A Very Glee Christmas 9/10:  A wonderful episode that puts you into the holiday spirit.  Again, the writers gave Beiste a really heartfelt speech like in Never Been Kissed.  They also give homage to other classic Christmas specials.",1293926400,6,2987,4.7823529411764705
4331925,5,B004DCB2CG,"I just want to say that it's ridiculous that people are giving this one star because of the price for a half-season. Way to make the series look bad with few stars, people.

4331926,5,B004DCB2CG,I just started watching glee for the Britney episode and I'm hooked.  The music and acting is great with great scripts ..  It's my new favorite show.  One of my favorite episodes was the new Christmas one..wish it would have been on this DVD set.  Just got Season 1..thanks Santa,1293321600,3,279,4.52
4331927,4,B004DCB2CG,"Yes, I agree, the price for this set is a bit frustrating, especially when you can pre-order the full season for about the same. However, I am still buying this first volume like I did last year, simply because I do not want to wait nearly a year to own the new episodes of the show. I feel that getting the first volume soon after it airs on television at least somewhat compensates for the price.

As far as content goes, I think this season has been great so far. Personal favorites include ""Brittany/Britney,"" ""Grilled Cheesus,"" ""The Substitute,"" and ""A Very Glee Christmas."" I have heard/read a lot of complaints about the inconsistency of Season 2 among other things, but the only problem this season for me has been the ""Rocky Horror"" letdown, which is really the only reason I knocked off a star. Otherwise, the stories have been generally great, and the entire cast continues to shine (most notably Heather Morris as Brittany and Chris Colfer as Kurt). The music continues to be fantastic, although if I could change anything, I'd go for a little less top 40.

Granted, I am aware that the show has many flaws, but I love that. If I were looking for any sort of ultra realistic portrayal of life, then I more than likely would not be watching a musical, now would I? Season 2 may not be quite as consistent as the first one, but it is still an incredibly joyful, fun, and altogether entertaining escape, and THAT's what television is supposed to be.",1292976000,4,1458,4.561068702290076
4331928,2,B004DCB2CG,"Fool me once, Glee, shame on you. Fool me twice? Uhh...I don't think so.

Minus *one* star for the absurd price for a split season, especially after last year when you offered a ""part one"" then the ""full season"" without immediately offering a ""part two"". Are you not milking this cash cow enough, 20th Century Fox? I'll hold out for the full season at a reasonable price, thanks. (People do have DVRs, you know - if you want buyer loyalty, how about meeting us halfway?)

But I'm NOT just dinging the rating because of the marketing...minus *two more* stars for the general drop in the quality of the show. Aside from Kurt and his Dad (and two well deserved Emmy nominations for Colfer and O'Malley), the bulk of the characters have become whiny and unlikeable, especially Will and Rachel. Only Brittany and Sue (and sometimes Santana) are worth watching. The storylines seem tired. The musical choices are spotty. Gwyneth Paltrow's guest appearance was outstanding but overall this is a textbook sophomore slump to date.

Let's hope they pick it up in the second half and close strong. Maybe we should light the Bat-signal for Neil Patrick Harris?",1292976000,13,1148,4.817258883248731
