906448,3,6304618352,"Face/Off is worth seeing, but I'd be a little miffed if I'd paid $7.50.  The story is based on an interesting premis...what if you could the faces of a good guy and and a bad guy.  I just had plenty of difficulty with the  way they did it.  I just didn't believe that the characters would act the  way they did. And the science was pretty bad as well.  But at Amazon's  prices, I'd buy it and watch it. Once you get past the dumb operation on  the faces, the story is very entertaining.",912384000,,486,4.095744680851064
906449,5,6304618352,"I think John Travolta and Nicholas Cage show some of their best acting abilities in this movie. The changing of roles from good guy to bad guy, allow you to see these two at their full potential. What makes it great, is  that it doesn't interfere with the non-stop action!",912211200,,272,4.44
906450,4,6304618352,"Face/Off is among the few selected titles that mark Paramount's much anticipated launch of the DVD format. The release is a good first attempt, but certainly lacking in features that make it difficult to justify the  high price. At the retail price of $29.99, one would expect better  supplement than the inclusion of just the trailer. One thing that is  included is the annoyingly long copyright warning that can not be bypassed  before entering the menu. Which mean that each time we are watching a  Paramount movie, we are forced to sit through the entire warning over and  over again. At the end of the week, I am able to recite the warning in  three languages.
Face/Off is transfered on a dual-layer disc and there  lies a problem, my Panasonic A110 would not recognize the layer switch and  skip the chapter entirely. At the end of chapter 18, the switch should  occur, but instead chapter 20 appears next. I could manually switch to  chapter 19 but that basically ruined the sequence. My player has no problem  with other dual-layer discs, so I will have to chalk it up as a defect on  the pressing of the disc. If you encounter the same problem, return it for  a new copy. The menu setup is rather bland, but that is fine as some of the  animated menu can become quite tiresome. However, one thing I don't like is  the fact that the movie defaults to the Pro-Logic mode rather than the 5.1  channels and you can only change it during the setup and not while the  movie is playing. Ditto for the subtitles.
I find the print that was  used for the mastering not as clean as the THX transfer of the laserdisc.  There were some dirt particles inherent on the print that did not show up  on the laserdisc. I also noticed more shimmering and jaggedness than on a  typical DVD transfer. Pixelation also rears its ugly head on one particular  scene. Besides that, images are sharp and colors are instrinsic. Contrast  and brightness are excellent with deep blacks and well defined shadow  details. Fleshtones are natural and consistent. The framing follows the  theatrical ratio of 2.35:1 for an excellent presentation that has no  problem containing all the mayhems.
Right from the start, the encoded  Dolby Digital soundtrack opens up a huge soundstage with creative mix for  the rear surrounds. The swirling horse carousel in the opening scene  provides for a startling 360 degree sound effects along with the  interspersing of a child's laughters. The score by John Powell is terrific  in dramatizing the surreal moment. At certain point, the score is  action-oriented to match the balletic sequences of gunfight and thrilling  chases, and at other time tender and reflective. The strangely beautiful  scene where Judy Garland's rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow played  on the little boy's headset amidst the bloody shootout truly bespeak the  artistry of John Woo. The score is recorded with great clarity and fidelity  for a tremendous impact. The many exhilarating shootouts and spectacular  chases take full advantage of the 5.1 channels with bullets richoceting  everywhere for some wild directional effects and huge explosions that  demand heavy workout from the subwoofer. Dialogue is naturally integrated.
As the third Western film he has directed, FACE/OFF is a vintage John  Woo film as he incorporated all his familiar trademarks.  The actions are  not just mindless, but are choreographed with style and poetry.  Mayhems  are often intercutted by slow-motion to capture the precise moment. His  plots often explore the issues of royalty, betrayal, friendship, duty and  justice. Nicolas Cage and John Travolta seem to have great fun switching  roles as they take us along for a wild ride. The supporting cast are  superb, especially Joan Allen for bringing a credibility to the role. At  140 minutes, the movie could be better edited and the high octane actions  might be exhausting for some viewers. However, there are moments in the  movie that are just pure cinematic delights. Face/Off comes highly  recommended.",911260800,3,4039,4.940387481371088
907129,1,6304618352,"An interesting premise drives this action pictures story, and there are multiple attempts to inject moments of heartwarming romance and family togetherness throughout Face/Off.  But these attempts to draw emotion and sentiment from the audience, even including a bit of religious symbolism, are at their heart cynical and manipulative tricks to make an essentially shallow and violent movie seem deep.  Every type of violence imaginable is employed: guns, knives and beatings, prison riots, several big explosions, car chases, boat chases, helicopter and airplane stunts, fatal falls from great heights, breaking glass and mirrors, you name it. This movies glorified gun violence alone is non-stop to the point of actually becoming tedious.  If this is what entertainment has become, were in big trouble.  Not that violence hasn't always been a part of one of the worlds favorite pastimes (going to the movies), but there comes a point when we should collectively say, enough is enough!

But lets just forget the moralizing for a moment and analyze the use of violence in this movie as plot device. The old identity switch idea got a fresh face, and that's what was kind of cool. Why did this idea need to descend into nothing but flying bullets? Whereas the James Bond films, for example, used gun play and other violence to drive their stories, there were also moments of genuine wit and humor, particularly in the earliest series with Sean Connery, that reminded us that these were just movies. They had style and a sense of fun, and more importantly, they weren't meant to be taken seriously. But as time has passed, filmmakers have continually upped the violence quotient, trying to outdo one another it seems. Is this what is now thought of as fun? Face/Off has so much gun fire and explosive violence that its beyond ridiculous.  Even the attempts at humor cant rescue this bloody mess from being nothing more than a sadistic assault on the senses.  While I love many horror movies and other kinds of films that employ violence and gore, Face/Off goes thousands of bullets too far. Were I a parent, I would not let my children see movies like this.  But aside from moral indignation, there came a point in Face/off where I just had to roll my eyes and think, oh, brother!

The cast cannot be faulted in this picture. The two leads, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage give their characters all theyve got, and the supporting cast is excellent on both sides of the good guy/bad guy spectrum (watch for a young Margaret Cho in a non-comedic role). The photography and special effects are dazzling. But what could have been a fascinating thriller with a great idea for its story, is reduced to a testosterone driven bore, due to its unbelievable and ludicrous plotting, which relies almost completely on action and violence rolled out so fast that the viewer doesnt have much time to think about how stupid and impossible most of the story is. Despite attempts to be inventive with the violence, there isn't even much imagination employed here, aside from a couple of clever twists, and one expects a few plot turns to keep this type of action flick going for two hours. But If I had known what a blood bath this movie was I would not have picked it up.  I almost stopped it half way through, but the premise was interesting enough that I stuck it out to the bitter end  so I guess it at least had that one good idea to justify its existence.

Those who like relentless gun violence and non-stop action, who don't want to really think about anything, and who are suckers for easy sentiment masquerading as something profound, will be entertained I suppose, but if you aren't one of these people, consider yourself warned!

And one final comment from a card-carrying, bleeding heart Liberal:  Hollywood Liberals get upset about the rash of school shootings and police killings in America over the past couple of decades, and they get all indignant and exercised over the political aggression of the NRA. While I may find some agreement with them, they should also take a look in their own back lots if they seriously want to discover one of the causes of American boys fascination with guns and violence.  Face/Off is as good an example as any.  Just sayin'",1521504000,,4255,4.800273597811217

907380,5,6304618352,"What can be said about this fantastic film that hasn't been said already? As a film, as a way of life, as a testament to everything that was right about the world in 1997,  it has everything.

Joan Allen and John Travolta are terrific, but Nicholas Cage truly steals the show. Little known fact that Nicholas Cage's heritage can be traced back into the 1600s, to the Ginhorse Skin tribes of Alabama.  His performance in Face/Off reminds me of an old native american healing song, ""Craig"", which some say was inspired by Cage's actions in the 1997 Classic.

""A wise man once said Gingers rule. What? Gingers no soul? No way. Craig have soul. Craig soul man. Soullll mannnn. Gingers beautiful. Look dis guy""

Impossible to deny the clear connection.  The Ginhorse Skin tribe must have been watching this classic film, writing this song, and flipping out of their Gord. On to my personal favorite scene, when Cage is losing his Abdullah oblongata while he creepily says ""I could eat a peach for hours"".  Legendary line that reminded me of the Ginhorse Skin's dominance of the upper south mountainteous great plains regions of Alabama.

All in all, perfect score.  5/7.",1513036800,4,1165,4.785

I did reconsider this John Woo-directed action thriller. I have to tell you, my 2 co-workers, while they are very sweet people, are completely devoid of credibility in their assessment of movies. Face/Off truly is a macho piece of crap. It tries to tell the story of a good guy and a bad guy so bent on beating the other that nothing will stand in their way. It is the worst showing of Nick Cageeach line of dialog seems to be offered up for the pleasure of ridicule. Travolta is right in his wheelhouse as the world's most overrated, living actor. He is just awful. Both characters eventually surgically switch faces because this will provide a big competitive advantage for victory over each others' foe. I still have no clue whether Cage or Travolta is supposed to be the good or bad guy.

908185,5,6304618352,"Must admit this film is one of my many favourites down the years, though somewhat far-fetched (today who-knows ?)
for me it harbours two outstanding performances (among their best) from lead actors 'John Travolta' and 'Nicolas Cage'
Several years have past since F.B.I-AGENT 'Sean Archer's' (John Travolta) beloved young son 'Micheal' was gunned-down
and killed by master-criminal 'Castor Troy' (Nicolas Cage) in an attempt to kill the F.B.1 Agent....since when 'Sean' has
had his intent fixed on catching 'Troy'
A tip off finally gives him the chance at Los Angeles airport, after a fierce fire-fight and chase, 'Troy' is apprehended if but
in an unconscious state in fact a condition that has left him in a coma he is unlikely to recover from.
However before 'Troy' is thrown down a wind-tunnel he goads 'Archer' that a bomb has been placed at a key-venue and
will explode sometime in the coming days....'Archer' try's to learn of it's location from 'Troy's' brother 'Pollux' (Alessandro
Nivola) who was captured also at the airport, though 'Archer' realises the treat to be real 'Pollux' does not give-up it's
location.
A dilemma for the F.B.I for sure, with time running out 'Sean' is told of a new-medical procedure that involves switching
faces, could it be that taking on the appearance of 'Castor Troy' is the only option that can be taken to locate the bomb ?
The procedure won't matter too much to 'Castor' who lies in a Coma, but 'Sean' sure isn't gonna be happy taking on his
arch-enemy's appearance.
'Sean' now as 'Castor' faces the trials of life inside a high-security jail where 'Pollux' is held, but will learn of the bombs
location, now he has to pass the information on, however, meanwhile, the real 'Castor' awakes from the Coma and using
some measure of force, insists the face of 'Sean' is given to him by the surgeon that performed the original operation.
'Castor' now assumes the role of F.B.I Agent 'Sean Archer' taking over the real 'Sean's' identity at work and at home leaving
'Sean' (now Castor) in jail.
The real 'Sean' has now to try and break out of jail and reclaim his identity, but how is he to convince his wife, daughter
and the authorities he is indeed the real 'Sean'  ???
Of course 'Castor' will do everything and anything to prevent 'Sean' from re-assuming the life he now has which inevitably
leads to an explosive show-down.
The film with plenty of action throughout is certainly what i would describe as exciting entertainment....a while since last
watching the film in truth, but, like many favourites we have, all different of course, always worth a re-visit.

AN FBI agent has his own face removed and the face of a comatose terrorist grafted in its place so he can go into a maximum security prison and convince the terrorist's brother to tell him where a bioweapon has been hidden.  Of course the terrorist comes out of his coma, figures out what happened and forced the doctor to perform a second transplant giving him the agent's face and the fun begins, as he infiltrates the FBI agent's work and family.

Who is really who?

Perhaps this isn't much of a synopsis but indeed this isn't a simple movie to summarize though it's an interesting one to watch. It gives both Travolta and Cage a chance to play good guy/bad guy in the same film, that of a man pretending to be someone else pretending to be himself.  It's interesting to see each take on the role of his nemesis in such a way that one could almost believe he actually is that character under the face.

A Review for Time Magazine called this not a ""thrill ride but a rocket ride,"" and it definitely is...violent, yes...dull...not a bit.  It's an action movie with a difference.

Face off is a very much a product of its time. It couldn't be anymore over the top, and it certainly try's very hard to do that.
It could be argued, that on a number of levels, it succeeds widely in its intentions to be the craziest action movie ever made. The film co stars two of the biggest names of the time, Nick Cage and John Travolta.

The dynamic and somewhat classic exchange might make you wonder why there haven't been more marquee action hero names co-headlining features to create this kind of onscreen sensationalism. Face Off is pretty much one of the bigger ego driven duel action features on this side of Tango & Cash.

Face Off is a large scale, over the top action film that arguably has not been topped since it came out in 1997.
John Woo directed the film and his stamp is apparent.
Prior to directing Face Off, he presented successful action films such as.
These flms afforded him the opportunity to create Face Off with complete artistic control, and the result is certainly something unique.

Travolta & Cage play arch enemies & they also play each other. Travolta plays an ace special agent named Sean Archer. He is hellbent on taking down international mastermind Castor Troy, played by Cage. To figure out Troys master diabolical plan, Travolta must switch faces with a comatose Cage, so he can interact with troy's crony brother. It's the only way & he has to do it! Sound ridicules? That's not even a fraction of it.

As outlandish as it is, it's pretty much a must see for all action/science fiction/B movie experts.

911154,5,6304618352,"Face Off is a twisty, gut turning revolutionary film of its time.
It provokes human emotion, and sometimes claustrophobic reaction to a dilemna which no one can foresee happening.
Its a who's who crisis mixed with Intel, superbly staged fight scenes, and a realness to the acting which shows that older movies really didn't rely on special effects for their punch, but on clever lighting, acting, and drama.

A must see, you will be baited, hooked, let off the line and rehooked from beginning to end
until you feel like you don't really know if you would have been criminal, CIA, FBI or just plain undercover in this movie.
It all becomes so confusing yet crystal clear.

John Travolta plays the role of a FBI Agent, who attempts to stop the terrifying events from a Terrorist, played by Nicholas Cage. The action is explosive, and the edge-of-your-seat suspense has you biting your nails, while waiting to see who wins the war, and who will survive.

911864,4,6304618352,"Seriously, the premise of this film requires suspension of disbelief.  After that, it is very enjoyable, mainly thanks to leading men John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, who soon switch roles while nicely hanging onto their original personalities.  Whether these men learned each other's little habits for before the switch (as those portions of the film make up about ten minutes total) or after, it doesn't matter...the switch works because they pull off playing each other.  Also, despite his reservations for such roles, Mr. Cage ought to be a villain more often.  It'd be refreshing and interesting as I found his performance right at the beginning very good.  Anyway, Joan Allen and Gina Gershon make great leading ladies as the intelligent wife of the fed and the ex-girlfriend of the evil terrorist who wants a better life for her son.  True, things got a bit corny at the end, but it's an action movie.  So, if you'd just like to be entertained and are willing to suspend your disbelief, go right on ahead.

912718,4,6304618352,"Good: Attempt at mature story, ballet-like action sequences from John Woo, amazing performances Nicholas Cage and John Travolta

Bad: No reason to choose the Blu-Ray over DVD

Oh, John Travolta, never change. Just keep overacting... Oh wait you did change, for the first part of the movie. You imitated Nicholas Cage's typical style for the first quarter of Face/Off when you played FBI Agent Sean Archer. Oh, how are you Mr. Cage! When you started off this movie, you were chewing the scenery as Castor Troy. However, things got back to normal for you in the second act.

The whole plot of the movie is that Sean Archer needs to switch faces and voices with Castor Troy to go undercover and find out where Troy hid this bomb. However, Troy wakes up, kills everyone who knew Archer was undercover as Troy, then steals Archer's face and voice, and goes around pretending to be Archer. Cue gunfights and actual character development.

I admit, your movie is goofy. However, I like how director John Woo managed to add some artsy (though kind of obvious) symbolism for the dilema of having to kill the man wearing your face. Also, the fact that your characters were trying to live the lives of the enemy was extremely interesting. There were some missed opportunities, storywise, but I didn't mind. I do kind of wish the Blu-Ray had some more features.

Oh, sure, I understand. You two have important things to do.

912827,5,6304618352,"Not giving a book report summary of the plot or acting critiques here.  Just focusing on the Blu Ray transfer itself.  Should you check on any of my reviews, and I hope that you do, that is what you will get, only a discussion of the quality of the transfer.

The video transfer onto Blu Ray, as opposed to the standard def version of Face Off, offers an improvement in both resolution and shadow depth....it is not the best video transfer I have ever seen and there are some scenes that appear soft and perhaps muted via the compression, but never the less, the video transfer to Blu Ray is good.  There aren't any hints of video banding, aliasing or artifacts.  Some snow or grain can be seen if you look for it but it is not very apparent or in any way distracting.

The audio is the star of this transfer, tho the audio on the Standard Def version was also good.  You are offered DTS 5.1 or 5.1 EX.  I preferred the DTS audio and, tho it is lossy, the disc is still demo worthy as it will definitely give your audio system a huge workout.  This is a loud movie and, at one point, I had to turn the volume down a touch.  There is excellent use of the discreet channels and panning of effects from front to back and side to side.  Your sub woofer is kicking out the jams producing as much bottom end as your system can handle.  My system is very high end audiophile gear and it was wonderful to hear it put to good use.

The extras provide deleted scenes, an alternate ending (which I am glad they didn't use) and a lengthy and comprehensive 'Making of'.  Commentary tracks are included as well as a very interesting bio of John Woo.

I have long loved this movie.  As I said, the standard DVD version was not bad at all.  Therefore, the jump to Blu Ray doesn't provide an earth shaking difference but it is still a great BluRay and well worth buying.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

912831,2,6304618352,"The thought of John Travolta and Nicolas Cage in the same movie is just like an overload of dreckitude that I can't even fathom the idiot who thought this up, but apparently it went over well so what do I know.  I still question the taste of the world when I realize the draw that these men actually have in Hollywood, but I wash my hands of it.

It's about twenty years too late, but it appears that the world has started to smart up to these guys.

`Face/Off' is your standard action thriller in the sense that it lacks a lot of brains and instead infuses a lot of dynamite into each frame.  Cage is his usual bland self, and he basically sleepwalks through the majority of the film.  He tries to be all flamboyant and edgy in the first part of the film, but it comes across as stagy and laughable really.  John Travolta fares much better, because his mockery of Cage's flamboyancy is more believable and more fun to watch.  The idea of face swapping is rather preposterous, especially when you factor in the vast differences in the builds of these actors and the supposed technology they claim to use in the film is merely shrug worthy.  The thriller aspect of the film is light, but the action (especially the film's bookends) is heavy and fun to watch.  I shouldn't have expected more, but I did, sort of.

Woo has a way with action scenes, but he's produced far better in his career.  In retrospect, this film doesn't hold up in the way it did back in the 90's and I'm sure half of the film's supporters would feel that way too upon a recent viewing.",1339632000,,1556,4.349480968858131

912949,4,6304618352,"I've been on a bit of a Nicolas Cage binge lately and I found this one and decided to give it a shot. Warning, this review contains spoilers.

Overall, the movie was good. The idea for the plot was pretty cool - switching identities. Why this had to be done by literally switching faces and not with masks is beyond me. I figured that'd be the easier, faster and less invasive method, but what fun would that be? Let's do totally unnecessary, stupid crap to make the movie more thrilling! In a nutshell, Castor Troy (Cage) shoots government agent Sean Archer (Travolta), accidentally killing Archer's son in the process. Archer is seeking revenge and kills Troy. Needs to talk to Troy's brother Pollux regarding the location of a ticking bomb in Los Angeles, so his colleagues propose the use of a radical, experimental surgery involving literally switching faces with Troy.

Troy's body is being kept alive for the sole purpose of this face-switching surgery. How convenient. The faces of Archer and Troy are sliced off with lasers. No need to disconnect veins or nerves or anything - just slides right off like a slice of cheese. Now here's where I have a problem. Nicolas Cage and John Travolta have very different body structures: Cage has a slender face and a long nose, whereas Travolta has a more square face and a smaller nose. Their skin tones are not perfectly identical (close, but not perfect). Cage has a smaller frame and Travolta is chubby. Why are there absolutely no scars left after the laser reconnecting of the switched faces? I mean I know they just switched actors, but they are two actors who do not look alike. I don't think Cage's face would fit on Travolta's head.

Anyway, turns out Castor Troy isn't really dead and violently rouses from not a near-death vegetative state, but a brief coma. He has the same surgeon who worked on Archer attach Archer's face to Troy's gaping hole formerly known as his face. Chaos ensues and Troy (posing as Archer) goes to Archer's house. He manages to gain a considerable amount of weight in less than a day to match Archer's body shape (translation: switched actors).

Action scenes and stuff, Cage plays the role of an inmate AGAIN, and then you find out some sex buddy of Troy's had a son by him. A son that looks exactly like Archer's dead son (I think played by the same child actor). This becomes important later because Ms. Hump-n-Dump gets killed protecting Castor/Archer and tells him to care for her son. At the end of the movie, when Archer has his actual face back on, he brings this orphan home to his wife and teen daughter and says he wants to keep him. Not out of any goodness of his heart, but because the child is obviously meant to serve as a replacement for Archer's deceased son.

Is it a bad film? No, of course not. It's got some great fight scenes, cool special effects, the sound is beautiful, the actors play their roles very well...they went a little nuts with the slow-motion action scenes, but whatever. It works. I guess the whole thing with the logic behind the surgery bothered me because I do this real stupid thing called ""thinking"" and I know this crap would never work. Not the way they depicted it anyway. If Travolta were to become Cage, highly invasive and extensive surgery would be required, not just peeling his face like an orange. They wouldn't need to show it all, but mentioning everything that is needed would have made that part better.

So if you like Cage and/or Travolta and you don't look solely at the bad things, it's a pretty good movie. Honestly, I thought the errors were more funny than bad. They just stuck out like sore thumbs to me.",1335312000,,3655,4.615384615384615
912950,5,6304618352,"On the whole, I like John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, in some respects, Travolta plays an amazing badass bad guy and Nicholas Cage can play the good guy pretty damn good but in FACE OFF, there is a serious Role reversal of sorts.
Travolta plays an FBI Agent Sean Archer, who has been tracking terrorist Castor Troy for years and steps up the search after Troy ""accidently"" kills Archer's son while trying to kill him.
A gunfight ensues at the airport when troy tries to make his escape by plane and gets ""killed"" there without revealing where he planted a device, which when detonated, will kill the population of LA. (May have the city wrong, doing this by memory right now).
The only other person who knows the location of the device is Castor's brother and he's in prison and he isn't talking so there is a new technology that allows face transplants so the idea comes about to transplant Troys face onto Archer's body and plant Archer in prison, where he will get Troy's brother to tell him where the bomb is.
Unfortunately, this is a movie and everything doesn't go quite as planned, Troy wakes up from his ""Death"", which turned out to be a thought to be irreversible coma without his face, walks around the unit where the transplant took place and puts two and two together and decides to have his goons round up the team and bring them to the facility for a late night procedure.
And all of this is like in the first 45 minutes to an hour, of course, I left some stuff out but I can assure you, it just gets better from here.......Trouble ensues and loyalties are tested and this movie is one rip roaring BANGfest!

This movie definitely gets 5 stars in my book as being one of Travolta's and Cage's best, I reccomend it to anyone who likes ACTION at it's finest!",1335052800,,1770,4.462962962962963

What follows is a heart-racing, action-packed film of revenge and, more importantly, duality.  Can we comment for a moment on the 'Troy' 'Archer' reference.  Achilles was taken out by an arrow to his one weak spot, his heel, in the siege of Troy in Homer's grand epic work.  It seems that the duality and the interwoven lives of Archer and Troy do not just lurk beneath the surface, but in plain sight as well.

In a sense Archer must become Troy in order to save the day and what results is a spell-binding story that has you overlooking the sometimes overly dramatic scenes that can set even the  most die-hard romantic to vomiting.  That is my one complaint about the film: it is often too dramatic.  Otherwise we are greeted with a superb control of the underlying difficulties facing the characters of this thrilling movie.  Once their roles are switched their true nature comes to the forefront of who and what they stand for and how they view each other's lives.

Stunning camera work, use of dialogue, and suspenseful drama make up the core of this intense film and give us over two hours of excitement that are hard to forget.",1321315200,,1581,4.544169611307421

If you try not to think too much about that aspect of the movie, you're in for one sweet psychotic ride. This film could have been made several times over with different actors playing the lead roles (Harrison Ford/Michael Douglas, Alec Baldwin/Bruce Willis, Al ""Michael Corleone"" Pacino/Robert DeNiro, Jean Claude Van Damme/Steven Seagal, Arnold ""The Terminator"" Schwarzenegger/Sylvester Stallone) to excellent effect.

I saw Face/Off in the theater when it came out.  I wasn't really expecting much before the lights were dimmed and the 20 minutes of previews started rolling.  But when the movie began, I was immediately drawn into it and it held my attention throughout.  This was one of the great action movies of the 1990s and really is one of the great action movies of all time.  John Travolta (as Sean Archer) and Nicolas Cage (as Castor Troy) give great performances.  It's funny to watch each of these guys ""become"" the other and make mistakes as the movie progresses.  The movie is packed with action galore, I mean really high intensity action.  I feel that this was the movie that really helped John Travolta shed the typecasting he suffered through beginning in the late 1970s.  He was always associated with movies such as Grease and Saturday Night Fever.  Nicolas Cage is a veteran when it comes to action movies, and he delivers big time in this one.

Overall, this is a great action thriller that should satisfy your craving for over-the-top action and violence.  Highly recommended.",1301443200,,1100,4.731578947368421

Wild to say the least.  You get so caught up in this movie you forget who is who and get into the flow of the movie.  It carries you away and it is so good because there are not alot of movies now that really carry you away from reality.

913022,5,6304618352,"Sean Archer (Travolta) has been trying to hunt down his son's killer, an infamous terrorist named Castor Troy (Cage), for six years. Now, Troy has activated a bomb that would destroy a large portion of Los Angeles, and the only ones who know the exact location are him and his brother Pollux (Nivola). When Troy is knocked out and put in a coma, there is very little development in knowing where the bomb is supposed to be. Archer has only one chance in getting the information from the sociopathic Pollux, but his own brother is the only one he can trust. This leads to a highly secretive surgical procedure, in which Sean Archer ""becomes"" Castor Troy. After the surgery, there is hardly any difference: the hero looks exactly like his rival. And since this movie requires a whole lot of suspense, the story takes a vicious turn as the real Castor Troy miraculously comes out of his coma, and forces the doctors who were responsible for the operation to help him ""become"" Archer. Soon, ""Archer"" revels in his rival's family life, while ""Troy"" adapts himself into his rival's criminal life.

Yes, the plot may be a bit implausible, but I think that's beside the point. What we have here is not only an explosive action film, but also a distinctive human drama. We see how this secret surgical procedure affects both men's careers, companions, and loved ones. And the drama mixes very well with the action scenes, which are some of the best ever filmed. Director John Woo has done a superb job with this one. Bullets and shells fly everywhere, cars and boats explode, people are jumping from here to there, it's almost insane! And yet, Woo and the screenwriters still give us time to breath with some dramatic scenes involving the chemistry between both main & supporting characters. Almost every scene involving action and drama is contrasted perfectly. Again, the plot isn't entirely realistic, but what really matters here are the high-octane action and the effective drama. Congratulations to Woo, Travolta, Cage, Allen, the supporting cast, the stuntmen, and the entire crew that worked on this film.

913023,2,6304618352,"PLEASE understand my low rating on this video is not because of the quality of acting, it is in the ""over loaded action"" and unnecessarily complex story to develop the plot.  Everything blows up, and they kill a zillion cops, even the good guy ""Travolta"" kills some.  However, the plot lacked in believability and does not flow right.  The video was a cross between a Sci-Fi and the normal bad guy-good guy super hero who can't be killed. The movie started off with the hero's son being shot accidently instead of the ""secret agency"" operative for unstated reasons.  Them after 6 years the hero locates the killer and I was ready for the usual revenge seeking cop trying to capture or kill the bad guy (Gage).  But as the story dragged on and on I just wanted it to come to a conclusion. The action scenes were full of pyrotechnics and they went on et nausium. The end of the movie had the usual good guy bad guy fight to end but it went on for 15 minutes blowing up half of LA, or so it seemed.  The bad guy ""Gage"" even came from the dead as many cheap cop videos do, but this one dragged on and on.  The cutting off of the bad guys face and sewing it on the good cops face, after removing his real one, so he could do the ultimate undercover job to find the hidden explosives that would take out a square mile of LA, killing 1000's people was also over done. I did like the secret maximum torture prison miles out into the ocean on an old oil platform. I did wonder how Travolta swam miles and miles back to shore but they skipped that because they could not come up with how he could do it either  Watch it but turn off your mind, the noise will keep you awake and it does eventually end with the predictable mini love seen as the ""rotten teen"" and a ""surrogate son"" join the NEW ""Nelson family"" stereotype family.",1271721600,2,1817,4.246376811594203

913118,4,6304618352,"After a rocky start with 'Hard Target', Woo's early American film career continued in an upward trajectory with the underrated 'Broken Arrow', before culminating in this film, a highly characteristic deconstruction of the American thriller. (One might argue that then a disconcerting falling-off began with 'Mission Impossible 2', but that's another matter.) Once again Woo uses Travolta to good effect, establishing him as a preferred actor only this time in a plot that is, to say the least, bizarre. 'Face/Off' - at least to those who carp about such things - is unrealistic, unconvincing and, frequently, just down right silly. In this film it seems, the 'willing suspension of disbelief' has to be suspended so high, and so frequently, that it is almost out of sight.  But criticisms circling around the questionable realism of the film are missing the point. Woo comes from a film-making tradition where 'common sense' and 'logic' (particularly in action/fantasy pictures) are not considered by viewers as important as they are to audiences here. Stunts and plot lines regularly defy what would be our natural expectations and logic, grounded as we are in the different Western, realist tradition. In his film Woo uses the distancing, and peculiar advantage, that this cultural difference brings, creating an ironic comment on the action film, as well as indulging his own thematic obsessions.  The 'face/off' procedure is simply a plot device, a MacGuffin (to borrow Hitchcock's term for a red herring) allowing Woo's exploration of these concerns. In this light, it's not important that the operation is plainly absurd, or that Cage and Travolta are obviously different body shapes. What matters is the play that this change thereafter allows the director on identity, moral values, audience expectation, acting styles - and all the rest.  As if the underline this, Woo has the actors make a unique, artificial 'face off' movement (down the face with their hands) when the magic words are spoken on screen, a visible mantra to the whole procedure. The implausibility is thereby *emphasised*, not hidden, a dramatic device made into a flourish, not a liability. Woo in short doesn't care about plausibility, because his true concerns lay elsewhere.  But the sniffing at Woo's substantial achievement continues. Yet no one criticises Franju's 'Les Yeux Sans Visage' - which is equally ridiculous in its central conceit - even though there we are supposed to take the operation seriously. Perhaps because this type of event is 'allowed' without raised eyebrows, in our regular horror tradition we wave it through. In Frankenheimer's 'Seconds', to take another example, Rock Hudson is miraculously (and to my mind absurdly) created out of a body of a shorter, middle aged man. 'Seconds' is a (good) film without a post-modern idea in its head - yet has won plaudits because of the wider social issues it addresses away from the unconvincing new identity-creation.  'Face/Off', in short, requires a more sophisticated response from some critics and action fans than it has so far received. A comparison with some of the less complex and more mindless action pictures that appeared at the same time (the overrated 'The Rock' for instance) reveals considerable strengths and virtues. Whereas other action films come and go, 'Face/Off' remains obstinately in the mind, teasing the genre, inviting repeated viewings.",1254182400,3,3415,5.247252747252747
913119,4,6304618352,"Sometimes, being a legend in something doesn't guarantee success. That certainly is the case of John Woo, a legendary director in Asia, who has made some really influential action films like Hard Boiled and Ichi the Killer. Many of his films are strong influences on today's crop of action directors and actors. When news came out that he was heading to Hollywood, everyone got excited. But in the end, Face/Off is the only one of the films he made in the U.S. that really made an impact. Which is a weird thing, since this film is without a doubt, the most far-fetched project Woo did in the U.S. and probably in his whole career.

The film's plot tells it all: FBI agent Sean Archer(Travolta) finally captures his long time nemesis, Castor Troy(Cage), the man who killed his son; but learns he has left a parting gift in the form of a bomb somewhere in LA. In order to stop him, Archer takes the face of Troy (who is in a comma)and ""becomes"" Troy in order to get the information he needs to stop the bomb. While he is doing that. Castor wakes up(sans face) and forces the surgeons who turned Archer into Troy to turn him into Archer and then destroys all evidence of it happening. The main characters have in fact, switched places. Troy now living with Archer's wife and daughter and Archer hiding within Troy's underworld contacts. Plenty of action ensues. Confused? I understand.

As far out and impossible as all this sounds, Woo makes it work. For length of the film you have no problem believing it is possible to turn someone like John Travolta into someone like Nic Cage. The reason for this is that both actors give themselves completely to their roles. Travolta truly shines, first establishing the tortured Archer, then having a blast copying the over the top intensity that Cage infused into the character of Castor Troy. Same thing with Cage. Though we only see him in the beggining as Troy, but it is more than enough for Cage to bring him to life. In 15 minutes, he projects every ounce of decadence and arrogance of the character. Which makes it the more fun when Travolta takes over and vice-versa. It is this interaction that makes this film successful despite the moon crater-like holes in this story. After all, the whole reason the whole convulted plot was concieved, was to explore the duality of good and evil within each of us. Incredibly, it succeeds.

Of course, this being a Woo film, there is plenty of action and gun-play. All of the trademarked Woo-isms are here: plenty of gun to gun stand-offs, churches, white doves and enough slow-motion to satisfy the hardcore Woo fans. Woo makes action look like a flowing dance and this film is no exception. The brutality and chaos of some scenes offset by slow-mo shots that makes everything flow. The beggining and end sequences are particuarly noteworthy.

The tranfer to High Def is pretty decent. It lacks the sharpness and detail of recent films but a lot of that has to do woth the age of the film. On the other hand, many older films have had better transfers than this one so it is probably a combination of age and a not-so-awsome job on the transfer. Having said that, this is quite simply, the best this film has looked on Home Video. Certainly superior to every DVD release of this film.

Face/Off is a great and entertaining film despite its flaws. The fact that you are able to really enjoy it even with the out-of-this world premise, is a testament to Woo, Cage, Travolta and the entire cast of this film.

John Travolta and Nicolas Cage star in this flick as two different men, one is the law and the other a criminal that wants to unleash terror. Who is who is for you to see, either way both will switch roles. To clarify for those who haven't seen it. Sean Archer (Travolta) is in urge for revenge after his son is murdered by a dangerous and insane terrorist known as Castor Troy (Cage). Castor is eventually captured by Archer...but he needs immediately the location of explosives that are ready to detonate. Since no one will tell him the location...he will have to become him. Literally.

It seems sort of silly when you think about it, but the writers wrote the script in a fashion that we forget the disbelief and take it for what it is...a movie. Not to mention Woo's amazing gun fu sequences which are exhilarating! The best since Hard Boiled and The Killer. I honestly can't think of anything big to criticize about this flick, it's by far a perfect action movie. This is definitely a must see on a surround sound system. A must own by all means!!

913256,5,6304618352,"I consider John Woo to be one of the greatest action movie directors in the world,and ""Face/Off"" proves just that. However,the element that makes this film one of the most intense and spectacular action movies to ever come from Hollywood is the presence of two tremendously talented actors,both of whom are my favorites. Yes,when you have John Travolta and Nicholas Cage together in a movie ,the results are bound to be over the top. John Travolta plays Sean Archer,a dedicated FBI agent who survived a murder attempt by notorious criminal Castor Troy six years ago. However,tragically his son died instead of him and since than Archer is relentlessly chasing Troy. Nicholas Cage plays Troy,and the film begins with a spectacular chase where we see the sheer intensity generated by both these great actors,and you realize that this is not going to be just another action flick. Troy escapes,but his younger brother Pollux Troy(played by Alessandro Nivola) falls into Archer's hands,along with a floppy that contains the blueprint for a bomb to be detonated in downtown L.A. Pollux refuses to reveal the location of the bomb and then a desperate Archer is given an option that is so spine-chilling that Archer refuses immediately. Realizing soon that he has no other choice,he decides to do what he is asked to-to exchange his face for Troy's, and what's more,to alter his entire physical attributes,so that he can go to the prison where his brother is being kept,and fool him into believing that he is Troy and get the location of the bomb from him. The plan seems to work until the moment Castor realizes what has happened,puts on Archer's face,and sets out for revenge. He fools the FBI,fools Archer's wife and sleeps with her and just when one thinks that this is too much,the real Archer escapes prison and it's payback time. Both Travolta and Cage play their roles perfectly,and they do a fantastic job playing each other too. The rest of the cast simply fades away in comparison,and who cares ? Dominique Swain as Archer's rebellious daughter looks good on screen-but that's about it. Joan Allen as his wife is not too impressive either. Gina Gershon as Troy's lover seems much more real in comparison. John Woo provides the film with a novel and flawless script,and some of the best action sequences ever filmed.

913361,5,6304618352,"Face/Off marks John Woo's first Hollywood movie where he was given complete creative control. While I am not familiar with John Woo's material except the new video game ""Stranglehold"" and his movie ""Hard Boiled"" (which I felt was mediocre, but suspenseful and interesting), I think ""Face/Off"" hit the spot for me and I will definitely check out the rest of his Hong Kong work (rumor has it ""Face/Off"" is his only true great American work due to lack of creative control of his other films).

""Face/Off"" begins with terrorist for hire Castor Troy's failed attempt to kill FBI agent Sean Archer, and instead killing Archer's young son. 6 years later, Archer is extremely close to catching him, and he finally does. However, just as Sean Archer is about to retire, he learns that Castor Troy planted a bomb somewhere but Troy won't say where (since he is in a coma). Since only Sean Archer knows Castor so well, he must undergo a top secret undercover mission (that only 2 other people plus the doctors know about). He must have his own face surgically removed and he must acquire Castor Troy's face and voice. After the surgery, he infiltrates the prison where Castor Troy is to go as well as his gang. He acts like Castor Troy very well.

However, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma, and he and his gang force the doctors to give him Sean Archer's face. Unlike Sean Archer, however, he cannot imitate his mannerisms. A whole series of twists and turns occur as Castor Troy is now living in Archer's home, and taking over his job.

The fact that the character of Castor Troy in the film continues to be himself while Sean Archer must act like the bad guy gives both Nicholas Cage and John Travolta the opportunity to be the villain. They both come across as creepy and downright mean throughout the film, and this a true test of acting skills and both pass with an A. And the ""gun-fu"" is excellent, especially since both characters had to have been in their physical prime, but it will probably be one of the best ever seen in a North American film.",1193097600,2,2047,4.572207084468665

Also includes 7 deleted scenes, a biography-type feature covering the life and career of director John Woo, and the original theatrical trailer.

The greatest disappointment here is that while several cast/crew members appear in newly filmed interviews, both Travolta and Cage participate only by way of vintage interviews filmed back when the movie was actually being made.  You would think they would have been proud enough of this great film to come back to document it for posterity sake...

913365,5,6304618352,"When it comes down to action movies, a lot of them are impressive visually and filled with cool set pieces yet a lot of them seem to be emotionally inert. It's as if they write the action scenes first and then decide to just connect them with the flimsiest of plots and barely any character development at all - or at least poorly-handled development anyway. One of the few successful ones at combining drama and action is Face/Off, directed by John Woo who did Mission:Impossible 2 but is mainly known for doing A Better Tomorrow and Hard Boiled. It's a cool insight in taking on personas we don't want to do but the freedom they can allow.

FBI Agent Sean Archer has been on a long hunt for Castor Troy, a known terrorist who's responsible for accidentally kiling Sean's son Michael in a failed assassination attempt. Well after successfully capturing Troy and his brother Pollux but leaving Castor in a coma, Sean receives grim news: a bomb is hidden somewhere in Los Angeles and is set to go off soon so Sean decides to go through an odd procedure: borrow Castor's face through advanced surgery and get the location of the bomb from Pollux in prison. But things don't go as planned as, even though he gets the location, the real Castor awakes, sans face, and takes Sean's. Now both are dealing with new people and the problems or the advantages they can create and both have to figure out how to kill the other and get their faces and lives back.

John Woo has been known recently for being an almost easier-accepted version of Michael Bay. Both make action movies yet don't really have the dramatic impact of anything. Of course Woo has done A Better Tomorrow, the Killer and Hard Boiled so he's got that going for him but Face/Off is probably his best Hollywood movie. Not only is it visually exciting but also has great character moments and interesting ideas. How would we react if we were supposed to react in a certain way because of the environment and the people around us? Both characters find it's not easy to just slip into a new life so comfortably.

But it would all fall apart if it didn't have strong actors and luckily we have John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who manage to both play twisted and psychotic for one character yet sympathetic and caring for another yet not feel disjointed when they switch places. The supporting cast also includes Gina Gershon and Alessandro Nivola on Castor's side and Joan Allen and Dominique Swain on Sean's end,  even James Denton (Mike from TV's ""Desperate Housewives"" and comedienne Margaret Cho turn up).

Even though it does have some ""Woo-isms"", namely flying doves, highly-kinetic action and characters' puzzling tendency to flip and jump when in gunfights and could've done with some trimming, it's still a fun and even touching action movie.",1190419200,,2803,4.70061099796334
913366,4,6304618352,"It took two Hollywood films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Target/dp/0783227892/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Target</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broken-Arrow/dp/6305280754/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broken Arrow</a>) before John Woo was allowed to cut loose with his trademark style on Face/Off. The result was his most commercially and critically successful American film at that point in his career. However, for fans of his Hong Kong films, this one seemed like a highlight reel from his earlier work as Woo recycled many of his signature shots Birds flying in slow motion? Check. Guy Leaping in the air while firing two guns simultaneously? Check. Unfortunately, Face/Off marks the apex of his Hollywood career. Woo has done nothing since that's been as good. So, to celebrate the film's 10th anniversary, Paramount has revisited the film with a brand new special edition.

Woo works hard to sell the film's admittedly outlandish gimmick by throwing all kinds of scientific mumbo jumbo at us and lingering on shots of spiffy looking technology. The swapping of identities also allows the filmmaker to examine one of his favourite themes: how two people can exhibit similar characteristics but be on opposite sides of the law and on opposite sides of the moral spectrum. It is nice to see Woo finally given a decent-sized budget to play with and two big-time movie stars like Cage and Travolta to work with. Despite a few audacious glimmers, like staging a chaotic gunfight around a child listening to ""Under the Rainbow,"" we still get a recycling of Woo's stylistic trademarks. However, this can be somewhat forgiven as it was the first real exposure for many North Americans to his work on a mainstream level.

The first disc features an audio commentary by director John Woo and screenwriters Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. Woo says that he initially passed on the project because he didn't think that he could do a science fiction film, but after working with CGI on Broken Arrow, felt more comfortable with the idea. The writers say that Woo concentrated on the characters and their emotions in their conversations together.

Also included is an additional commentary with Werb and Colleary that features a lot of repeated comments from the previous track. Werb and Colleary stress that they wanted to write an action film with a villain that was just as interesting as the hero.

There are six deleted scenes and alternate ending with optional commentary by Woo, Werb and Colleary. There's a nice, reflective moment where Archer spends the night in his dead son's room before his surgery and also two action sequences that are extended.

The second disc has a well-made documentary entitled, ""The Light and The Dark: Making Face/Off"" that can be viewed in five separate featurettes or altogether. Cage and Travolta talk about how they approached their roles, mimicking each other. Cast and crew praise Woo and his signature style and how well he works with actors. The film's elaborate practical, visual effects and stunts are all examined. Finally, Woo sums up the film - for him, it's all about family and how Archer achieves closure with his.

""John Woo: A Life in Pictures"" is a 30-minute profile of the filmmaker, from his humble childhood, living poor in a bad neighbourhood to a successful Hollywood director. It also takes a brief look at some of his key Hong Kong work but nothing too detailed for hardcore fans. This doc acts mainly as a primer for newcomers to his work.

Sony decided they didn't want my business by making their players more expensive and provide less features (they have done this with Betamax, Mini-Discs, S-DVDs, etc) and keeping antiquated relics from DVDs such as region coding etc.  It isn't reasonable to expect studios to release both formats just the same as it is unreasonable to expect a retailer to carry both and have to commit twice as much (or 3 times as much when counting regular DVD) so until there is a compromise, expect many producers and retailers to side with one or the other, all it means is that when one company goes exclusive with one format, a competitor will go with another.

913506,4,6304618352,"I watched the last third of ""Face/Off"" a few years ago while changing channels on TV.  I thought that what I saw was ridiculous and was glad I hadn't tried to watch the whole movie.  I saw some praise for it later and started to doubt the credibility of the source. However, I thought I would see what I thought about it by watching it from the beginning.  It certainly made a big difference.

This movie was a lot more complicated that I had originally understood.  The pace is fast-moving but the director makes sure that we see and hear enough to know enough about how we arrive at a technological twist to be able to buy into it.  The bad guy is bad and the good guy is good and the stakes are high.  It's hard to catch your breath in this movie (although I benefitted from commercial breaks).  There are twists and turns that keep you on your toes and the role-changing that takes place is ripe with many interesting possibilities.  The basic premise is that a top cop had a criminal's face grafted to his in order to go underground to prevent a major disaster.  Unforseen events keep popping up and then the movie got to the place that I had joined it several years ago.  I could see why I was unimpressed by having missed the story up to that point.  The fast pace continues to the very end.

This is a good action movie but it suffers from the indistructibility of the main characters.  These two guys get shot at so much, often at close range with machine guns, that you want to scream (or at least I did).  Consider the action in such movies as ""High Noon"" or the original ""Cape Fear"" where a minimum of shots are fired (if at all) yet we are rivetted to the screen from the suspenseful excitement.  I don't know how many score of bullets missed the mark of the Travolta and Cage characters but the shooting was clearly over done.  The closing scenes were the worst examples and probably caused most of my initial negative reactions.  Seeing it from the beginning added more such excessive scenes but it also weaved together a plot that was worth following.",1151366400,5,2067,4.394736842105263

What this movie has that they don't have is interesting characters, and two of the best actors in the business giving great and believable preformances.  Nicholas Cage and John Travolta look like they were meant to be together on-screen, and it is really interesting to see both play the bad guy and the good guy.  Every character in here was believable and intrigueing.  But the main attraction here is the action scenes.  This movie has it all, a prison break, a boat chase, a shoot-out in a church, and shoot-outs basically everywhere in the movie.  This will always be one of my favorite movies, and as far as action movies go its one of the best.  My one qualm with the movie is the hoaky ending.  For example; rebellious teen girl suddenly changes for the better, somehow Archer's face managed to stay intact, despite what Troy did to it, and the way that Archer takes the orphaned boy in.

913581,5,6304618352,"Face Off is in my opinion an all time classic film, the plot at first glance is fairly ridiculous and unrealistic but it is one of those cases where if you suspend your disbelief you will love this film.  John Travolta plays Sean Archer a police detective whose son was accidently killed by Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) while attempting to kill Archer, who had been tracking him for several years.  Archer then makes it his lifes ambition to catch Troy, and early in the film Archer finally catches and apparently kills his man (Troy is in a deep coma afterwards), only after he reveals vague details of a chemical attack on L.A.  After interviewing his brother Pollux Troy, they find out there is indeed an attack iminent in L.A, but he will give no details of the location.  It is then that the undercover Face swap idea is suggested, from this point on Archer is played superbly by Nicholas Cage, who goes into prison to recover info from Pollux.

The plot dramatically changes when Troy awakes fom his Coma, after finding a video of the operation and finding his face missing, he calls in a few associates to help him.  The doctor who performed the operation on Archer then grafts his face onto Troy at gunpoint, the few people who knew about the top secret mission are then all killed.  From this point on of course Castor Troy is played by Travolta.  I won't give away any more of the plot but what follows is both hilarious and disturbing, both leading men are superb, but Cage perhaps just steals the show, as he gradually becomes trapped in Troy's body (as Archer).  A great plot, an all star cast and superb acting make this action thriller a classic, like most great action films, there are great high budget chase scenes, hilarious moments (usually courtesy of Travolta as Castor Troy) and excellent drama.  Instead of ridiculing the plot, watch this with an open mind and you will see a superb action film, which I believe to be one of the best of all time.",1143417600,5,1969,4.568181818181818

Shawn Archer VS. Castor Troy.

Right from the begining, we feel Archer's angst as he is subject to an assasination that is botched when his son ends up taking the bullet. From that point on, he dedicates his life to taking castor troy, the man who tried to kill him, down. But what happens when you breathe in your enemy? You cough out his putrid voice.

Castor troy, after a battle with the famous agent, ends up in a coma. But, before he left the building, he left a little message concerning a bomb that will go off in less than a week. No one knows where it is. Except his brother: Paulix Troy.

Now, angrily dismayed, feeling like he has lost, overcome with hatred and brute vengence, Shawn Archer must assume the identity of Castor Troy.

Through a intense surgery scene, he is automatically driven back into his old habits: knowing Castor Troy inside and out. But it all goes downhill once Castor wakes up.

Now, the enemy has become the hero . . .and the hero the enemy.

This movie will wow you with excelent coreography, amazing visuals, fluid storyline, and the heart of a man who just wants his life back. It will capture your imagination from minute one. Enjoy!",1141516800,,1317,4.508403361344538
913583,5,6304618352,"One word can classify this movie: EXTREME.

Face Off has trully a very original plot to start off with and builds off of that with nonstop action and gorgeous visual effects. This movie reminded me of Die Hard, because these two movies are REAL action movies. Face Off might even be considered as being superior to Die Hard.

The movie is about a battle between two men. The good guy, Sean Archer (John Travolta) and the bad guy who killed Archer's son, Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage). When Troy is finally captured, there is a warning that there is a bomb somewhere in the city. But Troy is in a coma and his brother won't talk. Archer then decides to ""become"" Troy by taking his face in a very well made scene (surgery). But this ""simple"" procedure goes wrong and when Troy wakes up, he's mad. And he decides to take Archer's face. So they ""become"" two people. The only problem is that every thinks that they are the person they appear to be. So while Archer has become Troy and is in prison, brutalized..Troy is Archer...an FBI hero who's living the real Archer's life..living with his wife and daughter.

The movie is explosive and packs TONS of action. The body count is definitely triple digits and this is one hell of a good movie. It also packs some emotional moments and a good, sweet conclusion.

John Travolta steals the show! This is his best performance! He is the perfect vilain. He's trully great fun and is so evil!

The movie is a must see and its original plot and two lead actors let alone should draw you in.

Face Off is a must see, a brilliant piece of filmaking, one of the few blockbusters that is actually worthy of its tons of money making.

The thrills are constant, and just when you sit down to breathe for a while, guess what? MORE ACTION!

Face Off is John Woo's landmark American movie, a must see that is worth owning as it will deliver many viewings. It is a landmark action movie and its concept makes it a landmark sci-fi movie.

Nicolas Cage fresh from his Oscar triumph with ""Leaving Las Vegas"" but expanding into the action genre with ""The Rock"".  This is inarguably Woo's best American film and holds it's own with the Hong Kong classics.  There is no denying that Woo has few peers in his ability to stage exciting action scenes.  What's impressive here is that he manages to weave them successfully into a storyline that has so many intricate plot strands.  Travolta and Cage are more than up to the challenge of switching personas.  On more than one occasion they seem to playfully riff off each other's style.

913585,4,6304618352,"I've been somewhat disappointed with a few of John Woo's American films, feeling that his prime really took place back in Hong Kong.  But FACE/OFF is a happy exception.  I was very impressed with what Woo managed to do with this film.  First of all, let's examine the premise (as others have).  It is, indeed, one of the most absurd premises of all time.  A Cop and an Evil Villain swap faces and identities and are suddenly forced to deal with each other's worlds while they desperately try to ""get their face back.""  If you think about it for more than two seconds, this is the sort of plot that would make good fodder for a `B' movie...something starring Dean Cain perhaps.

But FACE/OFF is anything but a `B' movie.  I was entertained every second of this film for two simple reasons.  (1)  The action, as in all of Woo's films, is absolutely superb.  I'm not sure how Woo is able to achieve his ""ballet,"" but his talent is in full throttle for the entirety of this film.  The poetic gunfights, the slaughter set to ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" the entire chapel sequence, the class ""Woo"" ending...it's all here.  (2)  The acting is incredible.  John Travolta and Nicholas Cage carry this film.  Instead of becoming a corny movie about swapped identities, both of these characters manage to have a lot of fun playing each other.  In essence, what I'm trying to say is that these two actors make the premise work.  After they have ""switched,"" I found myself really looking at both of them quite differently.  Every once in a while, I would have to remind myself that the premise was not real and that the actors were playing each other.  Due to the fact that both Travolta and Cage have such big personalities, the film works.  If it had been cast with the less talented bunch that we normally see in action films, it would have failed miserably.

If you're not typically a fan of action films, I recommend that you see FACE/OFF.  It will give you a new appreciation of the genre and perhaps also give you some insight on the current work of other directors, such as Quentin Tarantino.",1130889600,2,2089,4.556451612903226
913586,5,6304618352,"""Face/Off"" is a dynamite-packed action powerhouse, with loads of stuff being blown to Kingdom Come, lots of people getting shot at and shot and loads of fun tossed in for good measure.

The basic plot takes you along with obsessive FBI agent Sean Archer in his all-consuming chase for arch-enemy and criminal nasty type, Castor Troy, backed up by his genius brother, Pollux. Part of this chase requires Archer to assume Troy's identity via surgery, completely off the record and totally ""black bag"". Of course, it all goes wrong.

""Face/Off"" almost seems choreographed in its fight sequences and shoot outs, which is pretty usual for director John Woo's style. However, the action is fast, furious and volatile. There is also lots of it.

Both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage are brilliant as Sean Archer and Castor Troy, a challenging duality of personalities to act. Both actors did a marvelous job of it.

Under all the violence, there are glimpses of Archer's personal journey as he delves into Castor Troy's world. Archer's dealings with Sasha, (Troy's girlfriend), promote some realisation and increased humanity in him.

Improbable? Yes? Fun to watch? Double yes. A movie with impossible and illogical lunacy better do something special to make it work and keep you glued to the screen. Well, Face Off is one of those movies, it's amazing how good the movie is (out of line logic aside) John Woo is a genius! Face Off starts out with a very morbid scene of Travolta's (Sean Archer's) son getting killed by Cage (Castor Troy) and may even draw some tears to the ladies, but from that point on, it's just non-stop action movie to boot and a massive battle between the good guy and the bad guy!

 The movie indulges itself with a very good (but crazy script) and some very clever lines. Fine acting from the newbies and of course Cage and Travolta are the perfect match for this one. How could anyone seriously not love this movie? Case in point, my girlfriend watched this for the first time a few nights ago and she had tears, laughed, and jumped out of her seat about 5 times and said ""that was amazing, that's Cage's best movie."" I also heard ""oh my God, oh my God"" out of her a dozen times. The movie simply keeps you involved and that's why it's so great. It's about being fun, and Face Off is one of those movies that you'll want to watch over again. It's fast, funny, morbid, but most importantly, fun!  You'll see crazy things like Cage getting dressed up as a priest and doing a dance to the Halleilujah chorus, you'll see an FBI agent and a psychological madman trade faces and bodies and battle it out, you'll see speed boats crashing into eachother on a lake and colliding with other boats, you'll see planes get blown up, crazy gun fights between Cage and Travolta, you'll see guns and more guns too, you'll see Cage tell a story about his wife cracking a tooth on a rice seed, you'll see Travolta *Archer* throw a guy on a corvette and beat the crap out of him for attacking his daughter, you'll see the final clash between Archer and Troy in one of the best action sequences I've ever seen.

The music in the movie is very well orchestrated, it's a bit reminiscent of the ""Speed"" movies and really gets your blood churning. I do have a minor nitpick in the movie. Toward the end some of the stunt devils look pretty bad and don't look like Cage and Travolta at all, people with big screens watching these movies will laugh seeing these guys, they really don't look anything like them. The movie is nearly over two hours though and you'll truly never get bored once, I guarantee it. Anyone who says this movie isn't fun doesn't enjoy movies, because this is what movies should be like, just fun and crazy! Do yourself a favor and buy this movie before people forget out it.

913652,5,6304618352,"Rarely does an action movie manage to rise above its mindless shoot em up execution and offer an indepth character study of both the protagonist and the antagonist that helps us better understand them. John Woo managed to do this with his 1997 movie ""Face/Off"", an absurd but well thought out movie that many modern action movies should be modelled after.

As I said the plot is absurd. Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a ruthless FBI agent out to capture and, if possible, kill Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), a homeland terrorist who accidentally killed Archer's young son in a botched assassination attempt. When Archer succeeds in his goal, he thinks it's time to retire and go home to his troubled daughter and his wife (Joan Allen). But, as Pacino would he say, just when he think he's out they pull him back in. It turns out that Troy is still alive and has planted a bomb set to go off at the L.A. Civics Center (at least I think that's where it was). Using new science, Archer and Troy trade faces. Archer, as Troy, will infiltrate a maximum security prison and get the scoop on the bombing from Castor's brother, Pollux. Of course, as expected, Castor emerges from his coma and realizes his face is gone. He forces the surgeons to give him Archer's face and then kills them. He torches all the files that proves who's who. When Troy finds out what happened, he goes ballistic. He stages a daring prison escape and delves deeper into the life of Castor Troy. Troy, meanwhile, has a ball being Archer, sleeping with his wife and getting heaps of praise showered on him as he defuses the bomb he planted. Archer will stop at nothing to get his true identity back and kil Archer before it's too late.

As I said, the plot couldn't be more absurd. However, it is very easy to understand. It's more unrealistic than it is absurd. It also does a very good job at examining the pysches of both Archer and Troy. Woo gives us revealing looks at the inner aspects of the two, what makes them tick, why they won't stop until one of them is dead. Most action films are just mindless shootout movies with a few bad catchphrases and weak characters. Woo managed to go beyond this and create one of the most intelligent action movies ever.

The film is violent and bloody as hell. However, the violence is very stylized and is not overused, as the violence adds a lot to the tension. ""Face/Off"" is a relentlessly entertaining action thriller that I would highly recommend.",1123200000,,2460,4.5610859728506785

The movie starts with a flashback, we see Castor Troy in sniper mode trying to take down FBI big man, Sean Archer who apparently is always on his case. Sean is with his small kid and when Castor takes the shot, it goes through Sean's back and hits his kid in the head. Six years later, Sean is a real hard-a$$ who devotes so much time trying to track and kill Castor that he neglects his wife and teenage daughter. Castor is looking cool as ever and he plants a bomb in the L.A. convention center to take out 3 judges. He succeeds in planting the bomb, but is caught when he tries to escape in one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. In his attempt, he is left in a coma. To find out the whereabouts of the bomb, Sean takes on Castor's face, literally to uncover the situation of the bomb from Castor's brother, Pollux. Castor awakes from his come, takes on Sean's face and the story ensues...

When it comes to stylized action sequences, no one but John Woo is the master. Note that I said ""stylized"", not ""gory"" or ""realistic"". In fact, to thoroughly enjoy this movie, you have to pay no attention to logic. The plot has many shortcomings, but the action more than makes up for it. The story is captured in awe-inspiring action sequences that involves planes, boats and every other thing that explodes with style. The two leads also make the movie that much more than what it is. They are given unique roles because they get to play the bad guy and good guy, and they nail it. Nic Cage has always been one of my favourite actors, he can always play diverse roles with ease. As Castor Troy, he plays him as an extremely cool albeit slightly demented guy. A scene when he steps out of his car with his coat flapping ever so cool, is classic. And when he plays Sean Archer, he turns into someone suffering and in pain. John Travolta meanwhile is a much better Sean Archer than Castor Troy, but that's not to say his performance was bad. He really did a good job as well.

In short, this is superb movie to just sit back and enjoy. The action is implemented very nicely and it just seems that the actors are having a hell of a time.

913656,5,6304618352,"In Hollywood,there are realistic films,but there are also unrealistic films also. A movie is a movie-and we've seen realistic fiction movies before(""Mercury Rising""),realistic movies that were true stories(""Windtalkers""),and there are also some films that as good as they are,have been unrealistic. ""Face/Off"" falls in the category of films that happens to be unrealistic. However,it is also unbelievable,and it is one of the best films both Nicolas Cage and John Travolta have ever done. Read on for my review of this:

This movie starts off with John Travolta playing Sean Archer,an FBI agent in Los Angeles. Archer has pretty much everything-a wife,a lot of awards,and even though she has become really bratty,a teenage daughter named Janie. However,there is one thing that is missing from Archer's life,and this isn't something like a condo in Aruba or the Democratic/Republican nomination for President-it's something more than that. What he is missing is his son,Michael,who was killed a while back ago(they actually show that at the very beginning of the movie). The man who killed him is Caster Troy(Nicolos Cage),a terrorist who is Archer's archrival. When Troy killed Archer's son,it was actually just an attempt to kill Archer;however,the bullet missed and ended up killing Archer's son. Ever since then,Archer has been trying to get even with Troy for killing his son.

Then,that day finally comes. After Archer has found out that Troy has planted a bomb in L.A. and he(Troy)ends up in a coma,Archer is approached by a fellow FBI agent who introduces him to Dr. Malcolm Walsh,who has a plan that will help Archer get the bomb and get even with Troy. The plan is that he(Walsh)will remove both Archer's face and Troy's face,put Troy's face on Archer's,and then Archer,disguised as Troy,will enter the Los Angeles prison where Troy's brother Pollux is at,stay there for a few days,find out where the bomb is,and then get pulled out of the prison,find the bomb,and get it out of the building. So,even though Archer is reasonably worried about several things(he has been told that he can't tell his wife,his boss,or anybody about the operation)he takes the mission.

Then,the next morning,Archer(who is now portrayed by Nicolas Cage)wakes up wearing Troy's face,and enters the prison. Things are going hard for him,but after all,he is Castor Troy(or so they think). However,Archer accomplishes what he is there for-he finds out where the bomb is,except there is one problem:Troy eventually wakes up from his coma,makes doctors transform him into Archer,and then after that,kills all of the doctors who knew about the information and burns all of the papers that have proof about what happened. And once that happens,well,I won't give away everything,but here is a good example of what it is like for the two archrivals once they are wearing each other's faces:

""I don't know what I hate wearing worse:Your face or your body. I mean I certainly do enjoy boning your wife, but let's face it, we both like it better the other way yes? So why don't we trade back""?

This is defnitely one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. The chemisty is strong,the acting is really good,and if you put yourself into the shoes of one of the characters in this film and totally forgot that you were watching a movie,You would probably find it interesting to how Troy acts when he is disguised as Archer(and everyone thinks that's who he really is)while you see how Archer acts when he is disguised as Troy(and everyone thinks who he really is also).

913658,3,6304618352,"Action movies, by their very natures, are inherently silly beings.  Lots of bullets fly around, explosions abound and crazy stunts are common occurrences.  Add in a bit of an SF plot (the surgical replacement of faces), and you have Face-Off.  This John Travolta/Nicholas Cage vehicle ups the silly factor by a large degree, and while it is fun, it goes just a little bit too far over the top.  Travolta hams it up once he becomes Nicholas Cage's character while Cage goes the opposite direction, carrying intensity to such a degree that I sometimes wondered if he was constipated.

Sean Archer (Travolta) has been tracking Castor Troy (Cage) for years, blaming Troy for the death of his son.  This obsession has come to affect his marriage as well as the rest of his personal life.  Archer finally gets the drop on Troy, but Troy falls into a coma before he can reveal the location of the biological weapon that threatens Los Angeles.  Using a revolutionary medical technique that allows Archer to wear Troy's face, Archer is to go undercover in a maximum security prison and talk to Troy's captured brother to get the location.  Unfortunately, the real Troy wakes up from his coma, manages to kill every FBI agent who knows about the plan along with the doctor who did the procedure (though not before getting the doctor to put Archer's face on him).  Thus, Archer is trapped with Troy's face in a prison where nobody knows who he is, while Troy wears Archer's face and assumes his life.  Chaos ensues.

One thing you can say about Face-Off is that it is quite stylish.  Directed by acclaimed action director John Woo, it certainly looks pretty.  One of the final confrontations has his trademark doves flying around in cool slow-motion shots as the bullets fly.  All of the action scenes are well choreographed (though one of them strains credulity more than most action scenes - details below) with a flair that not many directors manage.  If you like your explosions, this movie will certainly satisfy you.  It starts out with a bang, gets talky for a little while, and then starts up again, never stopping until it reaches a fiery conclusion.

The movie has a couple of plot elements that just bugged me, however.  The first is more minor, and was perhaps explained but I missed it.  The plan for Archer's infiltration of the prison just rubbed me the wrong way.  They're going to put an agent into the prison without warning at least the prison warden?  How was Archer supposed to alert anybody that he had the information that they needed?  Throw something over the wall?  I know that it was an outlandish plan that would have been turned down if they went to the higher-ups, but I think a second run-through of the plan was required before implementation.

Secondly, and illogical, the assault on the apartment where pseudo-Troy was staying was just wrong.  There's no way pseudo-Archer could convince law enforcement officers to carry out an attack that way.  They go in guns blazing after shooting tear gas through the windows to incapacitate everybody, with no intelligence on what they might find inside (like an innocent young boy, for instance?).  No, none of that.  Instead, they get enough firepower to win a major military engagement and just start blasting away.  Did it look pretty?  Yes.  Was it more preposterous than even most action movies?  Definitely. There were also a couple other plot holes that I can't really go into for spoiler reasons.

That being said, the plot was intriguing.  While I found the prison sequence hilariously illogical, I was affected by how Archer must be feeling, isolated behind a face that isn't his, with nobody in the world other than your nemesis knowing that you are who you claim you are.  It gets even worse when you watch your nemesis assume your life on the TV screen.  Cage does a good job showing the frustration that Archer must feel in this situation, with nobody to turn to.  Joan Allen, as Archer's wife, does a good job being torn between believing what the man with face of her husband's arch-enemy is trying to tell her, and screaming.  The final sequence is riveting for just this reason, as everything comes to an explosive climax.

The acting front is another place where Face-Off fails a little bit.  The performances are generally good, but I thought Travolta went way over the top.  He takes the Troy persona that Cage gives him and multiplies it by twenty.  The problem is that Cage was already playing him over the top, which makes Travolta fall to the other side.  He was clearly having a lot of fun with the role. Sometimes it works (the first scene with Archer's daughter, where he bums a cigarette off of her), sometimes it doesn't (the licking of her face when he's holding her hostage).  I did love his ""Christ on the cross"" pose during one of their confrontations.

Cage, on the other hand, gets way too intense sometimes, but then he usually does.  It worked when he was in the prison, but in some of his quieter scenes (as with Gina Gershon), he just looks like he could really use a bathroom visit.  Allen does a good job as Archer's wife, given the limited nature of the role.  She's around mainly to give Travolta somebody to play off against and to demonstrate the change between the two Archers.  The same applies to Gershon as Troy's girlfriend.  Archer and Troy are the two main characters, and nobody else is going to get much characterization.

There is a bit of social comment within the movie, though it is pretty blatant.  We see contrasting scenes of the ""stick up his rear"" Archer (the real one) and the ""happy-go-lucky"" Archer played by Troy that are obviously showing us that obsessing about something to the extent Archer has all these years is not healthy for either himself or his relationships.  Oddly, we don't see whether the real Archer actually learned this lesson, but the movie does imply that all will be well with the Archer family, so that's good.  Obviously, we're not seeing this movie for that kind of content, so back to the explosions we go!

All in all, Face-Off is a fun movie.  It is very close to 4 stars for me, but I just can't give them to it.  The acting of the leads is just a little bit too much for me to give it that kind of quality rating.  It would certainly be a 3.5 star movie, however.

I liked the premise, and Cage nearly acted Travolta off the screen, but the movie was derivitive tripe--stuff that's all been done before, and much better.  I haven't seen any old John Woo films, so I can't compare this to them (aside from Mission Impossible, which was okay but hardly great).  But here's my question:  What is with you people who jump on the bandwagon of movies like this (and I don't just mean action movies either)?  'Braveheart', 'Get Shorty', and 'Eternal Sunshine on the Spotless Mind' are other mediocre films that come to mind.  These films get such accolades and endorsements yet they're stupid, overacted, and often, really boring.  If you want action that happens to contain a lot of violence, see 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Heat'.  At least these movies have some intelligence behind the filmmaking, not to mention memorable characters.  Even 'Way of the Gun' was better than 'Face Off'.  This is a movie for those who are willing to leave their 'brain at the door', who are impressed by names and faces rather than actual quality, and who don't demand intelligence and originality in the movies they watch.",1112140800,5,1298,4.6946902654867255

The story line is absurd and the plot is thin but the magic here lies in the byplay of these two outstanding actors. Like melody and countermelody these two rise and fall, intertwine with each other, balance and finally combat one another in a climactic death song.

Ego and alterego find their full expression in the plots to kill each other, good and evil wrestle together and the future hangs in the balance as these two titans square off. Cage and Travolta appear to really enjoy playing off one another (and admit as much in later interviews) and it shows. Method acting finds its zenith in these two roles.",1111795200,2,725,4.65625

In one gun battle, that apparently  took a sum total of 3 months  to complete,  Woo  seems to be so aware that it is excessive that he cuts the audio, and we hear what the child bystander is hearing.

Even the Marine Boat chase turns into a disaster, when the Stand-ins  cannot even keep their wigs on straight. Did Woo skip the dailies, or does he like a little farce?

It is utterly incomprehensible how such a good story was messed up by Woo's visual  hyperbole. This story might actually might have worked in the hands of a better director, or even if the edit could be done by someone with a sense of how an action movie can work.

913741,5,6304618352,"Place this modern action classic up there with DIE HARD, SPEED, and THE NEGOTIATOR as one of my personal favorite action films.
Before watching FACE/OFF completely, I had taken a look at one of director John Woo's Hong Kong action epics, THE KILLER. I must say, I prefer FACE/OFF better. Sure, both films have that same over-the-top operatic style, but at least FACE/OFF isn't as shamelessly sentimental as THE KILLER was. In THE KILLER, Woo's main characters both demolished hundreds of extras in graphically bloody style, and towards the end it got a bit too much even for me. In FACE/OFF, the gore isn't quite as graphic, and while the body count is still pretty high, it never got to the point that I was disgusted.
I'm not a knee-jerk admirer of John Woo as some people are. That slow-motion technique of his can become wince-inducingly excessive, especially now that many lesser action directors have started to rip off his style. In this case, though, one is too engrossed in the plot and in awe of the high-energy action staging to notice.
Of course, most people probably already have an idea of what the plot is about: criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) dies, but he has planted a bomb somewhere in LA, so obsessive detective Sean Archer (John Travolta) literally swaps identities with his arch-nemesis to go undercover at a high-tech prison to find out where that bomb is. Obviously, this situation leads to various complications as Troy wakes up from his coma, takes Archer's face, kills the doctors who performed the operation, and then tries to find Archer. It's the typical body-switch, and I would be remiss to mention that Troy is responsible for the death of Archer's son many years ago, and thus Archer has a vendetta against him that explains his obsessiveness.
It's a potentially laughable premise, but the actors and director make you buy it. Travolta and Cage are both convincing and have a lot of fun playing each others' characters, and the supporting cast is just as believable. The script, by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, may have its bum dialogue lines here and there, but it's filled with ingenuity, plot-wise, as Troy tries to fit in with Archer's family and Archer tries to function in a prison. And of course the script gives director Woo plenty of leeway to go all-out with action scenes, and Woo does not disappoint, giving us plenty of stylish gunplay and loud explosions for about three action films, and even an audacious soundbite of ""Over the Rainbow"" as characters blow each other away. Woo sure lets his inventiveness run free here.
So okay, the film may be a little overlong, and that final gun battle at a church is perhaps too reminiscent of a similar battle in THE KILLER, right down to the flying pigeons motif. But all its flaws are forgivable in this case, since the movie is so thrilling matters of logic fall by the wayside. FACE/OFF may not be Woo's best film ever (I haven't seen HARD-BOILED yet), but it's pretty close to it, and in comparison to other modern action films, it stands pretty high there too. It'll ceratinly forever be one of my favorites. Recommended.",1087084800,3,3123,4.7744916820702406

You have to excuse the believability of it first of all, but after that you can sit back and enjoy it. Cage gives a good performance. Alessandro Nivola, who plays Pollux Troy, gives a great performance. And Travolta gives a five star, truly remarkable performance. He mimics Cage perfectly.

913813,5,6304618352,"FACE OFF has some of the most visceral, imaginative and jawdropping action scenes on film.  John Woo's direction is perfect in capturing the action scenes, whether he uses slow motion, or regular, he makes each action scene a cacophony of sight and sound.  Since we all know the plot, let's look at the talented actors who help make this movie such an intense entertainment!
John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are excellent in their roles; having to transfer from good guy to bad guy and bad guy to good is handled very well by these two actors who get better as they mature.  ALthough Nicolas has a couple of scenes that border on hamming it up, he nevertheless conveys the grief and hopelessness he is forced to deal with.  Travolta meanwhile goes from dull agent to sassy villain with immaculate ease.
Joan Allen, one of our finest actresses, does a marvelous job as Travolta's wife; Alessandro Nivola as Troy's nerdish brother oozes demonic sleaziness; Gina Gershon as Sasha does a very good job as Troy's mistress; Dominique Swain (Lolita) gives a nice turn to Travolta's misguided teen; Nick Cassavette as the baldpated Dietrich, Harve Presnell as Travolta's overwrought superior; John Carroll Lynch as the prison guard; CCH Pounder as one of the agents responsible for the switch, and even Thomas Jane (The Punisher) in a brief role as a downhome prisoner---all add to the quality of the movie and its outcome.

Basicly it was another trailer! and of coarse ""Cast biographies"" which wernt planned out very good, they don't even give you a list of movies Travolta or Cage have been in!

913819,4,6304618352,"Face/Off, the best American film by John Woo in my opinion is amazing.  It has one of a kind action sequences which are simply stunning and great, especially for being released in summer of 1997.  A success at the box-office and I'd say the best action flick of the decade next to Die Hard.  John Woo is a very talented action director and he uses his talents here immensely and that's why the film works.
  As for the premise, well it's just about proposterous, the idea of futuristic sugery is somewhat clever though.  The story of switching identites through futuristic surgery is original I must say and is a bit catchy enough.  John Travota plays Agent Sean Archer, early in the film after his son is killed by his archrival, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) a deadly terrorist he's out to catch him.  He soon does in an intense hanger shootout.  Unfortunately for Archer a bomb is somewhere in Los Angeles and in order to obtain information he must become Troy, because Troy's brother Pollux has been caught and is a prison facility.
They soon switch identities and the intensity begins.  Soon the film becomes more suspenseful when Cage's character wake's up from his coma to learn his face has been switched, he soon assumes the identity of Travolta, and the real Archer learns that the psychopath is living with his family.  From here we get more breath-taking and innovative action sequences including more shootouts and a great boat chase finale.  Explosions, gunfire and fistfights round out the fun!  John Woo crafts a great action film, better than Broken Arrow and Hard Target, I'd say.  And also probably better than M:I-2, even though it had its moments.  And definetly better than Woo's latest Paycheck, which was mainly good for the action sequences especially the bike chase.  All in all Woo's work is amazing and I hope to see more and hopefully better work from him in the future.
  Face/Off is rated R for Intense Sequences of Strong Violence and for Strong Language.  The violence includes intense shootouts which can be deafening, which are usually bloody, as well as some fistfights and a few other bloody images.  The language is fairly strong and consistent, but not overly used and not to the point where I could call it obscene.
The DVD unfortunately has one main feature, which is the Theatrical Trailer, which is a good trailer I should point out.

John Travolta and Nicholas Cage team up in what could be the best acting jobs by both of them.  Cage starts off in the beginning as the villain and Travolta the good guy.  After their faces are switched, then they reverse roles.  Before this movie was released I know some people had been skeptical towards Travolta playing a villain. We're all used to seeing him play good guy characters with morals (i.e. Phenomenon, Michael, etc.).  I'm sure he put those ballots to rest because he did a tremendous job as the villian.  Cage also did a good job the short time he played the villian and did an even better job as the hero.  The plot is powerful throughout the whole movie and keeps you motivated to keep watching.

913881,2,6304618352,"I remember watching this in the cinema in November 1997 with 698 other people (a full house) and only me and my pal hated it. Which is weird because I expected it to be great. The original script for the film had it set in the future but Woo insisted it be written in present day to not distract the audience. But the only thing that distracted me was how dull the film was.
Since coming to Hollywood John Woo has done little to impress. He mad a very strong debut with Hard Target but the film was cut to shreds and the impact severely muted. Broken Arrow was thoroughly unexciting and Face/Off is not much better.
The bulk of the blame lies not with Woo but with Travolta. As Sean Archer he's fine. But as soon as he becomes Castor Troy he turns the camp all the way up to 11. Face/Off eventually becomes an unashamed pantomime. Cage, as both characters, is very good. But Travolta takes Troy to the same place he took Vic Deakins in Broken Arrow. It's like he assumes that no matter what he does, it's automatically cool because IT'S A JOHN WOO FILM. Sorry, but that logic doesn't work out in real life.
The plot, while being crafty, doesn't really do much. Exactly what does Troy plan after becoming Archer? To look like his enemy for the rest of his life? If not it was a bad idea burning down the Plastic Surgery Joint then. Some interesting imagery is used and the subtext gives the movie a sharper edge despite its superficial appearance. All the 'gun ballet' stuff does is glamorise guns. And that's becoming real old hat.
Weird tho, when you think that this film is written by the folks that gave us The Mask and Death Wish V: The Face of Death. And John Woo would also dabble in face swapping later on with Mission: Impossible 2.
The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The only extra is a trailer.",1070064000,4,1834,4.3654970760233915
913882,4,6304618352,"I thought this film would be a lot more confusing than it actually was. I was expecting them to be constantly changing faces, rather than keeping the switched faces for the duration of the film.
After realising John Woo directed this, and after not liking MI:2, I was expecting to sit back and yawn right the way through it. Also, I'm not the biggest fan of Nicolas Cage, and a little bird told me that John Travolta was so camp in this film! But instead, I found myself on the edge of my seat. It's action right through from start to finish. A very concept for a film, although there a few bits I could criticise - possibly a brain transplant to ACT that much like the other person?! And of course there were the predictable moments - of course, Nicolas Cage would have John Travolta's face transplanted onto his. How weird. And of course I was sickened by the glimpses of Nicolas's cage meatiness without a face - UGH!!!
I actually found myself liking Nicolas in this film, and John managed to capture his moves and gestures down to a T - although he became too evil for me at one point, and I found myself not liking the character he was playing.
It reminded me a lot of the Matrix with the moves, and True Lies, with the fact the daughter was involved.
Not much of extras, but the theatrical trailer was great! For once, I enjoyed the shortness of a theatrical trailer. If I'd seen that when this originally came out, I would definitely have gone to see it.

913884,4,6304618352,"Under the category of movies with singularly absurd premises, there are two sub-categories: those that are unwatchable precisely because of their absurd premise, and those that are thoroughly enjoyable precisely because of their absurd premise.
Face/Off falls in the latter sub-category. The singularly absurd premise: FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has his face removed by high-technology laser surgery, kept in a preservative bath, and replaced with that of comatose killer Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). His mission: to pose as Troy in a high-security prison for the most dangerous criminals alive, and get vital information on the whereabouts of a time bomb somewhere in LA from Troy's brother Pollux. The mission is so top-secret that even the prison officials don't know. Nor do Archer's wife and daughter.
Now, here's where the absurdity mounts, and with it the fun: Castor, confined in the secret facility where the surgery was performed, suddenly wakes from his coma. He feels no face, sees Archer's face in the glass liquid container, puts two and two together, and phones his henchmen, who kidnap the facility's staff and the few others who know about the operation, have them attach Archer's face where Castor's once was, and then kill them. Castor Troy becomes Sean Archer, Sean Archer becomes Castor Troy, at least in face. Troy visits Archer at the prison to tell him to expect to spend the rest of his life behind bars, so Archer must find a way to get out.
Whew. It's actually a lot less complicated to watch, which is exactly what makes it so much fun. Plus, the high-tech laser surgery scenes lend the whole face-swapping scenario a respectable degree of credibility.  Throw in John Woo's inimitable directorial style, wherein violence is treated poetically, and you have a movie that's flat-out fun to watch.
And let's not overlook the demands of the script on the two lead actors. Travolta had to play the good guy, and then the bad guy pretending to be the good guy, but only when among the real good guys. Cage had to play the bad guy, and then the good guy pretending to be the bad guy, but only when among the real bad guys.

913956,5,6304618352,"The DVD of FACE OFF is one of the best, and a must-buy on the format. John Woo, uber director of The Killer (1989), Hard Boiled (1992) and Broken Arrow (1996) proves that even after the move to Hollywood, he still knows how to create fantastic action and Face Off is no exception. Building on the good but not great BROKEN ARROW, this one is a fantastic action ride. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Castor Troy, a villain, and John Travolta as agent Sean Archer, the only man who can stop Castor from unleashing a nuclear device.
Woo's trademarks are all present here: slow-mo gunfights, explosive action and those perennial doves. And both Nic Cage and Travolta are brilliant, especially Cage, whose eccentric performance is one of his most unrestrained and outstanding. One of the best (If not THE best) action films ever made. Excellent.

913958,4,6304618352,"Easily John Woo's most acclaimed Hollywood film to date, Face/Off is often mentioned among lists of the top action films of all-time.  But I can't say I agree, I didn't even think it was the best action film of 1997; that honor belongs to Wolfgang Petersen's nail-biter, Air Force One.  What Face/Off has going for it is an ingeniously silly premise and Woo's expert hand at crafting mayhem.  Both aspects work well enough to make this a fitfully enjoyable thrill ride, but never quite as satisfying as it should have been.
John Travolta stars as Sean Archer, an FBI agent whose son was killed by a terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage).  After years of exhaustive search, Archer tracks down Troy and his brother, and captures both siblings after a violent shootout.  But his brother, Pollux, reveals that a bomb is set to detonate somewhere in Los Angeles, and the FBI have little clue as to the whereabouts of the explosives and when its set to go off.
So one agent comes up with a wild idea, and shares it only with Archer and his partner.  It appears there's a secret laboratory that has enhanced technology capable of removing a person's face and placing it on another ""patient.""  The plan is to place Archer uncercover secretly in prison as Castor, but everything goes wrong when Troy awakens from his coma and takes Archer's face and identity, and even his family life, leaving the real Archer stuck in prison. Knowing this isn't a prison drama, you can guess what's going to happen from there.
John Woo is an adept action director and his work in Face/Off is superb.  The action rolls at a breakneck pace, mostly with bloody shootouts, much of them employed in balletic slow motion, adding a graceful touch that somehow feels appropriate.  There are also exciting fights and even a pulse-pounding boat chase in the finale.
Human drama is actually quite effective here, with Joan Allen giving us a solid and likable character who's caught in this whole mess, wondering who to trust and how to escape this nightmarish situation.  Nicolas Cage is just as good in creating a likable character in Archer, which is all the more amazing when you consider that he begins the film as a psychotic villain.  Even the sexy Gina Gershon brings humanity in a role as a protective, but crime-prone mother. Woo also plays on the whole good vs. evil concept, and it works just fine; there are the requisite doves and, uh, face/offs.
With great action and characters, what's wrong with the movie?
Right off the top of my head, it's John Travolta that bugs me the most.  Not only is he an overrated actor, he doesn't make a particularly convincing action star.  Overweight as he was at the time, watching him perform so many flips and death-defying stunts (obviously done by stuntmen) is too difficult to believe, perhaps even moreso than the silly premise of this film itself!  And when the transformation occurs, Travolta's performance doesn't match what Nicolas Cage gave us in the opening.  Sure, he's equally off-the-wall and insane, but he's actually just giving us another rendition of his villain from Broken Arrow.
The opposite can be said for Nic Cage, who actually improves upon Travolta when he becomes Archer, displaying frantic emotions with more urgency and believability.  As an action star, he's more physically cut for this kind of stuff.  Watching Cage perform balletic flips and outrageous stunts provokes an adrenaline rush, rather than an unintentional laugh.
The whole concept behind the movie is highly improbable, and the film manages to make it seem even more unlikely!  As far as dramatic intentions go, the premise works, particularly in a scene where Cage as Archer tries to convince Allen that he's her husband and another scene where Archer's daughter holds a gun toward both men, not knowing who to shoot.
But, man, this story is filled with plot holes.  The most noticeable right off the bat is the FBI agent whose ear is shot off in the opening gunfight.  When Travolta visits the lab, he sees the scientists and technicians rebuilding this man a new ear.  As stated before, this lab is meant to be secret to even the FBI, so how the hell would this agent explain to his co-workers how he got this new ear?  Castor (when played by Cage) is a fairly thin man.  Archer (when played by Travolta) is a fairly chubby guy.  I'd like to know how these scientists made the relatively thin Castor into a chubby guy.  Whose idea was it to keep this whole undercover plan secret to the FBI?  Sure, I see the need to keep it from leaking to the prisoners, but shouldn't at least the head of the FBI be aware of what's going on, so just in case the unthinkable happens, they'll know how to deal with it.  For that matter, how can such a laboratory, full of the latest in high-tech equipment AND holding the world's most dangerous terrorist, be left with absolutely no guards at night?  And why the heck did Nick Cassavetes kiss Gina Gershon (who plays Cassavetes' sister) full on the lips from just out of left field (okay, I realize he was a thug and was dying, but how many people do you know would give such a sleazy kiss to their sister as a farewell?).
With so many infuriating plot holes, Face/Off annoys almost as often as it thrills.  Admittedly, I had a higher opinion of it before repeat viewings, but the best action films still hold up in spite of implausibilities (Indiana Jones, Speed, Air Force One, The Mummy) because they possess a certain magic that keeps them above the rest of the crop.  Face/Off has style to burn and action that gets more exciting as it moves along, but by the end, I just didn't feel that much-needed movie magic that would have attained this masterpiece status.",1031961600,2,5717,4.69939879759519

914044,3,6304618352,"John Woo's action spectacular is one of those things that has an equal mixture of the excellent and the terrible.  It revolves around cop Sean Archer (Travolta) switching faces and identities with the man who killed his son, Castor Troy (Cage), whilst his enemy is stuck in a coma.  After Troy miraculously awakes from his coma (he is described as brain dead) he swaps faces with Archer and kills all of the people that know that the real Archer is stuck in prison trying to find out about a huge bomb explosion that Troy has planned.  If this sounds complicated, that's because it is, but the director manages to kepp it going effortlessly.  There's also a little delving into the psyches of the characters, with Archer beginning to enjoy the high-jetting lifestyle of Troy whilst still being sickened by looking at the face of a killer in the killer.  The movie also doesn't shy away from the awkward subject of Troy's sexual feelings for Archer's daughter Jamie as sweet-talks her in her father's body.
The cast is well-picked, with Travolta especially enjoying his role as the bad guy on the inside.  Cage is good as always and Joan Allen manages to steal just about every scene that she's in.  The acting in itself is an unusual slant on the thriller and it should be applauded by the fact that melodrama is often placed alongside the big set pieces and slow motion gunshots.
However, 'Face/Off' is a little overlong (the subplot involving with Gina Gershon could have been cut entirely, save the humour that she brings to the proceedings) and begins to get ahead of itself near the finale.  In particular the religious imagery used in a 'Reservoir Dogs'-style shootout will make most people cringe as doves fly across the screen whilst the two male protaganists face off.  This innocence juxtaposed alongside blood and guts isn't handled well, with 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' being played for one shoot-out.  This movie is most fun when we get to see Travolta acting the bad guy, worming his way into his families affections with his bad boy attitude.  To sum up, 'Face/Off' is a thoroughly superiour thriller until about half an hour before the end where it tails off.",1013126400,,2177,4.778666666666667
914045,5,6304618352,"This is a very clever movie. What if you looked in the mirror in the morning and saw your worst enemy staring back at you? John Woo's clever action film takes a sci-fi concept and uses it to tell a very personal story. Face Off is about an FBI agent, played partly by John Travolta (convincing in a serious action role) and partly by Nicholas Cage (again very effective in a tough part). The effects and technology used to achieve the body swap are impressive, but they are really incidental .
What makes the movie, and where Woo and the cast show their skill are the huge action set pieces juxtaposed with moments of intimacy. The death of Archer's son at the hands of Troy is particularly well handled, being moving without being maudlin. Care is taken over every shot and the editing makes this even more effective.

This one was so good and action packed in a brilliant way, that there was nowhere else to go but down. One awful action flick after the other. This film, directed by the brilliant John Woo, has something that few action films have. It has intelligence. Those don't come along too often. John Travolta stars as an FBI agent who's son was killed a few years ago by Castor Troy(played very wickedly by Nicolas Cage). Travolta finally captures Cage and is sent to prison. Travolta then has Cage's face graphed onto his to fool Cage's brother into revealing some information. Well, Cage gets wind of this and soon he escapes with Travolta's face. Still with me?. All of a sudden, our two stars are playing the other. Got it?. The two actors are wonderfully over the top. Their performances are big and flashy and fun. Neither one has ever been more interesting to watch. Then, there's the action. I have never seen action scenes like this before. They are bigger than life. John Woo is a brilliant man. The scenes come off almost like a well choreographed ballet. Their absolutely intoxicating. And, might I add, beautiful, in a very twisted way. It's a non stop crowd pleasing film.

First and foremost is the big gimmick, the hook, the selling point: the ol' eye-dee switcheroo, a tried-&-true offshoot of the classic ""evil twin"" formula. Nicholas Cage has himself surgically altered to resemble John Travolta. Or is it the other way around? Actually, it's a little bit of both, isn't it...? Anyway, Cage (AKA Travolta) has to chase Travolta (AKA Cage), `cause he's the bad guy and Cage is the good guy. Or is Travolta (Cage) the good guy, and Cage (Travolta) the bad guy? Well, anyway, both of them engage in the action-flick/suspense staple of the `cat & mouse' gambit, with the cat played by Travolta played by Cage, and- no, wait, that's not right...
Now, where was I... oh yes, you get the kinds of action sequences you've come to expect from a John Woo shoot-em-up (thankfully, with John Woo playing John Woo). It all  culminates in a speedboat chase between ... um... the two guys playing each other (AKA each other playing the two guys), and Cage (Travolta) finally takin' out Travolta (Cage) at the big climax... I think. As far as I know, it could be vicey-versey here too. Then at the end Cage (Travolta) becomes the original Travolta (Cage) again, and... or was it Travolta (Cage) that got changed back into-ah, forget it. I think I'll just plop down on the La-Z-Boy and watch Abbott & Costello's ""Who's On First?"" sketch; it's a lot easier to follow than this perplexing actioner.

Essentially, John Woo is a superb director of action sequences, but pretty lousy otherwise, and 'Face / Off' suffers from having lots of 'otherwise'. There are only two or three proper, 'Hard-Boiled'-style action setpieces, and for the rest of the film there's an awful lot of talking. Both Cage and Travolta are fine, although the latter seems to be starting to bulge out of his suit,. but the plot is ludicrous, the talky bits go on too long and don't add a great deal to the film, and there's the sense that, even today, Woo is being held back by Hollywood convention.

914239,5,6304618352,"Usually when we go to see an action movie, we keep in mind that the movie may not have the best acting or story line, but we will have the opportunity to see numerous gun fights, explosions, chaos, and so on.  Well, I have news for you.  All of the above WAS true, until a movie called ""Face/Off"" came out.
This is unlike any action movie ever made.  The story is so deep, and the characters are portrayed in realistic manners.  There are memorable quotes in this movie, but they are in no way corny.  The story has to be what sticks out most in this movie.
Travolta is an FBI agent, who wants to take out the villian, played by Cage, once and for all.  The main reason is because Cage is responsible for the murder of his son.  Travolta is able to take care of Cage, or so he thinks, and it seems like everything is fine.
Until it is learned that Cage had planted a deadly bomb somewhere in L.A.
Now, Travolta's only hope is to undergo brutal surgery to transform his self into Cage, in order to get the location out of Cage's brother.  Who could've imagined that the real Cage woul wake up and trasform himself into Travolta?
This movie has it all; suspense, action, and drama.  There are great gun fights which will take your breath away.  The action is intense, but the story is even better.
The only thing I had a problem with in this movie was that Travolta and Cage could never hit each other when they were in the brutal gun fights.  Sure, they could hit the janitor, innocent bystanders, and the other baddies, but never each other!!  Oh well, I guess you have to have that element to make the movie last longer.
This is one of the best action movies ever made, and I would advise people to view this wonderful flick if they haven't already.  The movie is so good, that it is an almost guarentee that you will watch it a second time.",992044800,2,1842,4.273775216138328
914240,5,6304618352,"When you think of an action movie, what is the first thing that pops into your mind?  Blood, bullets, bad acting, and above all, lots of 'splosions.  Well, most of those things are here, but there is one thing that sets it apart from the Steven Seagal bloodbaths of yore: the acting.  I have never before seen an action movie with acting this superb.  Everyone in here does a great job, but I think Nicolas Cage is the one that really shines.  This guy can act!  He goes effortlessly from psycho criminal to ""the nice guy"", doing very believable dramatic scenes.  While the main drawback of this movie is that it's pretty farfetched (drive-thru surgery, immediate recovery of the surgery, the magnet-shoes thing), it's still very well-written and very enthralling.  And hey, you gotta feel sorry for the parents that had not one, but two criminal mastermind sons.  I guess if you name your kids Castor and Pollacks, you're asking for trouble!
Anyway, if you're looking for a good action movie, forget about the Seagal and Van Damme movies where the fight scenes are the only things that make them worth it, get something that is well-written and never misses a step.  This is not only the best action movie I've seen, it's one of the top ten best movies I've ever seen.  ""Con Air"" is a good choice as well.",991267200,,1306,4.6103896103896105

FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta)has been trying to apprehend terrorist, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) ever since he murdered Sean's son six years ago. Sean apprehend's Castor during a violent shoot-out in an airport and as a result of this puts Castor into a deep comma. Sean then undergoes new surgery involving swapping faces with Troy. He does this to try and find out where Castor has planted a deadly bomb hidden somewhere in L.A.Castor awakes from his comma, with Sean's identidy and takes over his life. Sean(really Castor) disarms the bomb which he planted and becomes an instant hero. Meanwhile Castor (really Sean) is a high-tech prison trying to find information about the bomb from Castor's brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola).Since Sean(Castor) has destroyed all evidence about the surgical swap, Castor has to try and break out of prison. Not only does he have to fight for himself but for wife Eve (Joan Allen) and daughter Jamie.
This is a superb film with enough plot to become a series. It does sound far-fethced in places but John Woo makes it believable and real. Great performances all around including the two main stars, Joan Allen and the sexy tough female Gina Gershon.",989884800,2,1451,4.9753086419753085

THis movie is amazing. This is what made me the die-hard Woo fan i am today. Far better then anything else he made in America, though Broken Arrow and M:I 2 were cool. Hard Target just plain.

Doves flying around. A church. 2 guns. Lots of action. Truly cool. The action is amazing and blows away anything American action directors have thus far produced. Stunning and beautifull sequences of mayhem and destruction that only Woo could do. Cage/Travolta were amazing. Both should have been nominated for Oscars. Of couse the academy would look bad giving nods to people in an action flick but i think they did better then the other people nominated that year.

914359,5,6304618352,"Face/Off
Score: 85/100
Face/Off is not only a gun-blasting, emotionally charged piece of cinema, but one that truly delivers and ensures that Hollywood still knows how to fire away a good bullet of an action movie. The film is violent and disturbing, but action master John Woo makes sure this is all part of the plot. It's not very often we get such a good piece of action cinema like this film, so don't delay your viewing of it any longer.
FBI Special Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) tries to find a biological weapon placed in Los Angeles by a sadistic terrorist-for-hire and criminal mastermind named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Archer has hunted Troy for the last 8 years, and is consumed by revenge because Troy is responsible for the death of Archer's son. To do this, Archer must ""borrow"" Troy's face using a surgical procedure to go undercover as Troy, but things go wrong when Troy assumes the identity of Archer.
The story is visually complex but screenplayed masterfully and simply, the idea of taken the face off has been hanging around cinemas for a few decades now, but John Woo has finally put it to rest with this stimulating and exciting action thriller. The film has explosive and ear-catching sound that never lets up, and while all the gun-firing and blow-em-up scenes are happening (some tire, but all are intriguing), there is also some dramatic and emotionally involving acts, most coming from the scenes with Archer's wife, played beautifully but Joan Allen. Travolta and Cage are fantastic as they slow-motion leap from prisons and helicopters with intensity. You never know whether they're good or bad, and both play each character's evil/dark ""face"" with stunning appeal.
Face/Off, in short, is amazingly great entertainment from John Woo. The action and thrills are truly new and original, and all the good comments of this movie add up to a thrilling climax - this is a great picture.",986601600,,1917,4.883435582822086
914360,1,6304618352,"I accompanied some frenzied, drunk software people on a bus to Whistler, BC, Canada one fine afternoon, and as if their loud, intoxicated musings were not enough, the organiser of the trip decided we all should watch movies since she was so kind and organised to have brought them. She also took the trouble (this was her first week of work as the group's administrative assistant) to make Rice Krispie treats. Most people were thrilled, cheering about what a nice admin she is. I whispered to my friend (he is the one who has to work with these software people everyday, not me), ""It's her first week. She is still kissing a**. Of course she made Rice Krispie treats. We'll see how long that lasts."" Whatever the case, we had to, just like being back in elementary school again, vote on which videos to watch. We ended up watching Face Off, and oh how I could have done without it. Nicolas Cage is possibly the only compelling thing about the film and even his villain was not very convincing. He seemed more slimy than evil. The whole premise of people surgically switching faces is ridiculous, although I thought it was a nice turn of events when John Travolta's character ended up stuck in prison as Cage's villain after Cage came out of his coma, found himself faceless, and forced the surgeons to attach Travolta's face to his. It is all rather... inane. For an action film it was all right. But Travolta, as usual, overacts. Really not my style. But maybe it is yours. If you like lots of shooting, fighting, explosions, implausible storylines, well, this just might be your bag.",985564800,2,1586,4.647686832740214
914361,5,6304618352,"Face/Off has to be, without doubt, one of the greatest action movies ever made. It's a fact.  Anyone can cobble together a half-decent action movie when provided with sufficient budget, but Woo does it with such style and flair that it just takes your breath away.  The plot is original, though fairly superfluous, with some face swapping shennanigans. It's basically an excuse for plenty of explosions and awesome combat sequences. There's the usual Woo trademark 'leaping through the air in slow motion with a gun in each hand'. But none of the action is clunky or feels out of place (Broken Arrow). A destructive shootout with Over The Rainbow playing is a particularly memorable scene.  Then there's the actors. Charismatic John Travolta basically spends most of the film as the villian, which gives him much more time to have fun and come out with some great lines. ""Your son was an accident, I wanted to kill you. But you took it so personally."" He has real presence on screen, which sometimes causes him to overshadow his partner, Cage. Nicolas Cage, currently flavour of the month in Hollywood and one of the most versatile actors around, does most of the work playing the good guy, which is just as well since he looks rather uncomfortable as the villain. Still, he's perfect playing an honest man trapped in the body of a criminal, he can look both vulnerable and dominant when the occasion calls for it. Overall, both actors give great performances, learning to copy each others style so that it really does look like they've swapped faces.  Basically, Face/Off is everything you could want from an action film. It's got two great main characters, explosions by the bucketload, enough guns to invade a small country, and a climax that blows away the competition (as well as a dozen people, two speedboats, a police boat...)",984182400,5,1834,4.8498402555910545

914363,4,6304618352,"Highy suspenseful, original and thrilling, ""Face/Off"" is not just a play on words for its own storyline: its a grand-action masterpiece! Filled with high-speed thrills, explosions and guns, the pace never slows down, even when you don't hear the sound of gunfire pulsing in your ears. A stellar cast heads the way of this film, which adds to the emotion and heart behind it all, and under the direction of John Woo, famed for action and intensity, the movie is stylish as well as exciting.
Sean Archer, an FBI agent in Los Angeles, has a score to settle with terrorist Castor Troy that is personal as well as criminal. Upon catching Troy, Archer learns that there is an array of bombs hidden inside a building within the city, and only Troy and his imprisoned brother know the whereabouts of the devastating explosives. In an elaborate plan to determine the location of the bombs, Archer agrees to undergo a top secret operation in which his face will be surgically removed and replaced with that of Troy's making him look identical to the villian. Once inside the prison, his mission is complete, until Castor Troy pays him a visit with his face masking his true form. Archer, now trapped in the prison under the identity of Troy, must find a way out and bring the true criminal to justice before he harms his family and takes over his life completely.
This is one of those movies that you must pay strict attention to from the very beginning, or you will miss out on a lot of key elements, such as some of the turns that each character takes under their new identities. One of the best elements of the movie is that you will find you're not inclined to root for the actors as much as you root for the character of Archer himself; the fact that the two actors play both parts makes rooting for one of them difficult, for they each get a shot at playing the bad guy.
The story does have a strong premise behind it that is believable and contains a high level of suspense and action. The intensity begins with a high-octane chase at an airport, lots of explosions and gunfire, all mixed together in the story to create a fast-moving ride of thrilling suspense. The running time of the movie doesn't even seem a problem, because there is never really a dull moment throughout the movie; even the slow-paced scenes with the real Archer and his family have a significance that will play out in later scenes when the characters are switched.
The acting abilities of the two leads are specially showcased here, with each one getting to play different personalities and characters of different lifestyles and backgrounds. John Travolta is superb as the good-guy-turned-bad-guy, matching his performance in ""Broken Arrow."" We believe that Travolta is an ideal family man in the beginning stages of the film, and his care-free style and wit come right out when his character changes, and Travolta pulls this off in a great fashion. Nicolas Cage takes on the role of bad-guy-turned-good-guy, and his sentiment and emotion when he takes on the role of Archer shine through the entire film that you almost wish he were the good guy from the very beginning.
The supporting cast for the film is also a terrific addition to the story, with powerful performances by Joan Allen, Dominique Swain, and Gina Gershon. Allen plays the wife of Sean Archer, who plays a key part in discovering the secret of the ""husband's"" identity. When she is required to become emotional and tense, Allen does a great job of conveying the emotions. Dominique Swain, while not having much on-screen time as the daughter of Archer, plays out the rebel teen angst with incredible ease. Gina Gershon is a great asset to the film, as the lone female bad girl with past ties to Castor Troy.
""Face/Off"" is one of those movies where I found myself cheering in the end, while also crying when everything comes to an end. The mark of a good action movie is one that has a wallop of emotion behind it, and this one meets that mark. I found myself having fun while staying completely interested and enthralled throughout.

The magnificently choreographed gunfights and artistic use of slow motion make for some of the greatest scenes I've ever seen.

914480,1,6304618352,"Let me start off by saying I have nothing against John Travolta (although i did not like Pulp Fiction), and Nicholas Cage is still one of my favorite performers.  Actually, they both give good, twisting performances in this film. That said, Face/Off is an overblown, mind-numbing experiment gone wrong.
Granted, the first 15-20 minutes proceed well, with Cage as a dancing priest and the first-half of the airport chase/shootout.  But this film so rapidly deteriorates into a series of almost every bad action movie cliche sewn together. Poorly.
There are far too many bad moments to list here.  Is it the easy escape from the inescapable prison? Is it the heavy-handed use of a Disney tune during a shootout? Is it the fact that even the even the most disinterested of wives could tell if someone were impersonating her husband?  Maybe an exhausting boat chase.  No wait, perhaps a standoff at a church?  This movie takes ""ridiculous"" to a whole new level.
People will say that often we need to check our brains at the door, and just enjoy a movie.  With Face/Off, that is not possible (as it is with say, Independence Day) because it seems like it wants to be taken seriously, and it doesn't have enough of a sense of humor for us (me) to take it otherwise.
Fans of this flick are more often that not fans of the two leads, or worship at the feet of director John Woo. I don't know much about Mr. Woo -- except that M:I 2 was mediocre, but not offensively bad like this -- but his brand of so-called stylized violence can't save this sinking ship of a film any more than nice clothes could rescue Wild Wild West.

Now, this two movies have not shown up the quality of the  real John Woo Action(masterpiece)style!
BUT THIS ONE  HAS!
(Castor Troy=Nicholas Cage) (Sean  Archer =John Travolta)
The Story is quite orginal, but i don't have  mutch time so im gonna take it all in a nutshell: Castor(the terrorist)  tryes to kill Sean Archer(FBI), but instead he kills his son, Michael! So  now Archer has been trying to cath Castor Troy for eight years, and now he  finally does it!  (In a airport warehouse, after an magical gun fight) So,  Castor wounds up in an koma, but before that he, and his brother Pollux  placed a bomb, somewhere in the town! So Archer investigate Pollux, but he  doesn't get anything out of it, so he turns into Castor, by an operation,  to get some info out of Pollux. And now he finally does! But Castor awakens  from  his koma and takes Archers place, and it's now evreything begins!  (Okay, this wasn't a nutshell........ this was one big, giant  coconut!)
Wow! This is John Woo trademark! The fantastic two fisted  gunfights, the doves, the chirch, ''the eternal fight beetween good and  evil!'' You should have seen this, either you're a John Woo fan or not!  This is great! It's not as great as The Killer, Hard Boiled, ex ex! But  still it's his greatest Hollywood film! The only thing to complain on is  the happy ending with makes me a little bit sick, and the fact that it's  MUTCH more yabba yabba yabba(talk) then high quality action! But the great  lines and the teriffic dialouge makes up for it!

914590,4,6304618352,"I saw this in the theater when it was first released and then again last night on DVD.  This is a great thriller that you've gotta see.  Yes, it's action-packed and the body count is pretty high.  Woo wows the audience  with some really artful scenes:  Cage walking down the tarmac in all his  glory, Cage and Travolta facing off (uh, get it?) with the mirrors, the  little church with the doves.  Oh yeah, there's lots of gun fights and  explosions and stuff.
Face/Off isn't even a double entendre.  It's at  least a triple.  And very clever.  Get over the ridiculous surgery thing.  You'll still be wowed by the performances by Cage and Travolta as they  believably master dual roles.  Good transforms into evil; evil transforms  into good.
So why does this get a ""4"" and not a ""5""?  The sound on this  disc is great, but lack of extras is disappointing.  (If it matters, the  sound more than makes up for the lack of extras.)  I think the writers  tried to appease the female demographic by adding some sappy relationship  stuff - the film could have done without it.  But I guess the #1 reason I  didn't give it top ratings is that I couldn't get over how ""stupid"" Sean  Archer's staff (and wife and daughter) suddenly became when Sean no longer  acted like Sean.  Hello folks - did you check your brains at the door?  Don't let that stop you from seeing this flick.  The ""good"" far outweighs  the ""bad"".

Another  movie I'm split on, but in this case I know why: while Nicholas Cage shone  in this film in a way I've never seen before, John Travolta couldn't hold  up his end of it at all.

Cage was brilliant. Best I've ever seen him  do. Bounces from complete fanatic to distraught cop with no problems at  all, and plays both roles so convincingly you can actually believe they  could suck a face off person A and deposit it on person B. On the other  hand, Cage walked into Travolta's role halfway through this film, with  Travolta having set him up badly. And that was the role Travolta played  _well_. I don't know why he was so off here, but he just wasn't up to  snuff, especially after the switch. He just didn't work as a psycho (odd,  considering he worked so well as an antisocial murderer in Pulp Fiction).  Go figger.

So ultimately, the movie has to stand or fall on the  ensemble cast, since Travolta's given it two strikes. And it stands.  Alessandro Nivola, especially, is wonderful as Nicholas Cage's brainy,  sociopathic brother, and Nick Cassavetes makes a fine, fine bad guy. Add in  the patented John Woo action sequences, and this becomes a couple of hours  of good escapist fluff, if you can get past John Travolta as Mr. Wooden  Personality.",961286400,,1462,4.589147286821706

The DVD,  unfortunately, is disappointing.  The only extra is a single theatrical  trailer.

For a viewer who usually dislikes slow-motion because it  is kinda hokey I think he uses it so well it adds a lot to the film, and  I'm not just talking about the minute count.  Watching the action sequences  there are times where a gun falling to the ground seems to be the only  thing happening.  Somehow Woo weaves these moments into the action so  artfully the viewer can believe he is an omnicient observer, able to see  and hear everything necessary to fully appreciate the action.  The framing  is superb -- the wide shot of Castor Troy as his jacket billows or the  shootout in the hangar, where Troy dives out of the plane with both guns  firing are both suitable to hang on the wall.
The acting is so well done  even the most cynical viewer would be lying to say he didn't believe every  second of the ""no more drugs for that man"" scene.

The duo of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta,  exchanging roles, faces, and mannerisms, really showed off their previously  hidden acting abilities.  The plot was surprisingly interesting, if  repeatedly implausable.  And everything bled of style.  But none of this  got to hold the spotlight for long, especially against some of the most  intense double-fisted gun battles this side of the pacific.  Unlike  traditional hollywood fare which would throw more FX budget at a scene,  these were intense because they were well cheoreographed, stunningly  filmed, and playfully inventive.  Sure, John Woo peppered his action with  very cool, very human points of high drama, but the point of the drama is  getting your heart pumping, and at that Face / Off excelled.

What's amazing here is how we are completely convinced that one character  is suddenly playing another with the other's face on. This isn't just a  showcase of superb, hyper action, but also of great acting. Travolta  incredibly seems to have Cage's first role and Cage seems to perfectly be  Travolta's first role. Now about the action, it's also superbly done. No  one films violence like John Woo, who gives gunfights here an artistic  quality in the moves, the guns, the clothes, the way the camera moves.  There is a shoot-out near the end inside a chapel and Woo let's us see the  bullets in slow motion blast out from the barrels. He doesn't make action  boring as do some other action filmmakers, he gives it tremendous art  potential. ""Face/Off"" is never boring, always active and has  enough plot for an entire series.

The plot of  ""Face/Off"" is, to say the least, rather original- FBI agent Sean  Archer (John Travolta) undergoes an operation to switch faces and  identities with international terrorist Castor Troy. The two immerse  themselves in the other's identity and go to war. The action scenes are  exciting, if a little bloody (""Face/Off"" must feature the highest  on-screen bodycount in movie history). Woo's skills as a director are  considerable, but the real fun with ""Face/Off"" is watching the  acting duel between Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. The two essentially  switch roles halfway through, but the ironies are even better than that!  Each actor is pretending to pretend to be the other, and Cage and Travolta  are fantastic at it.
Action fans will be positively giddy watching Woo's  elaborately choreographed shootouts (though the harbor boat chase was a  little over the top for my taste). Unlike most action flicks,  ""Face/Off"" features some outstanding acting.

Now I have the DVD and watch it from time to time with  my friends. Guess what? I cry every time  Travolta brings home Castor's  orphan. It's surprising. The reason for this is that the magic of cineme  lives in this overindulgent and overlong movie.
It's silly to analyze the  plot and and test it against the patterns of real life. Any story of  swithed identities is hardly credible. Do you really believe the boy in The  Prince And The Pauper could pass for the noble heir to the British throne?  If you want to see this movie just RELAX and ENJOY!
It's not stupid but  naive or successfully passes for naive. Nicholas Cage is an actor of a VERY  limited range but as a cartoon villain he is perfectly cast. A lot of  scenes and objects are delightfully bad taste - just look at these  eleborately embroidered gold-plated twin guns. It's a movie of a kind you  can see in Bombay or Hong Kong but the power of Western moviemaking boosts  it into the international stardom.

The people  who consider Face/Off pretentious should see The Matrix which gives the new  dimension to this word.
I am sure that Face/Off's perfect blend of  Oriental sentimentalism and Western technical genius was made possible by  the stroke of luck.

914978,5,6304618352,"What more could you ask from a movie than to star Nicolas Cage, John Travolta and be directed by John Woo?. This movie will not dissapoint, The original idea for the script, plus the brilliant gun fights make this movie  a must have. The performances are brilliant, particularly the two leads. If  you love action movies there are four movies you should own, Face/off and  the Die Hard trilogy. This is a must have.",944524800,,415,4.581081081081081
914979,3,6304618352,"John Travolta plays someone who he isn't in this movie, and frankly I don't know if he knew who he was supposed to act like. In my opinion, ive seen Travolta act in many movies quite well, but both John Travolta and Nicholas  Cage put on the most terrible attempts at acting like the person they are  trying to imitate. In short Travolta looked stupid trying to act like  Nicholas Cage and vice versa. However, I loved the action scenes in the  movie. If your a critic about acting style and replay value than stray away  from here. If your an action junkie, this film will blow your socks off.  Ive never seen so many guns going off at the same time since Predator. That  made it worth it, though I was fast forwarding through the rest of the  dialogue.",944352000,,754,4.335714285714285
914980,3,6304618352,Not a bad film if you haven't seen it before but if you have then you begin to realize how rediculous the whole story actually is (plus over the top fire-works displays!) and the movie just seems to drag on until a more  than welcome end.,938390400,,238,4.173913043478261
914981,5,6304618352,"Firstly this film has got John Travolta and Nicholas Cage who are really good actors and are perfect for this kind of movie.  There are so many surprises and really good gun fights. There is a pretty good script too.  I  love the part where Nicholas Cage sais 'Well if you're Shawn Arthur ,I  guess i'm Caster Troy`and then hangs up. Anyway cool movie deffinetly worth  seeing.",938044800,,377,4.567164179104478

915096,5,6304618352,"Face/Off is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.  Complete with action, drama, comedy, an outstanding cast, and an original storyline this movie will fulfill every moviegoer's needs and more.  John  Woo's brilliant and artistic directing not only gives the film an  unforgettable style; it also adds to the plot of the movie through several  ironic instances.  And of course, the tag team of John Travolta and  Nicholas Cage is unbeatable; both of them truly make their characters come  to life.  This is not your typical action movie, it is a thrill ride  jam-packed with extraordinary filmmaking.  No one should miss this movie.",933984000,,652,4.889908256880734

915209,5,6304618352,"In a tivoli the FBI-agent Sean Archer and his son are merely having a caroussel-ride. A shot is heard, and the bullet meant to be hitting Archer, hits his son instead. Now the hunt begins. Possessed only by the mission of  getting the murderer and ice-cold psycho and terrorist Castor Troy. During  the hunt Castor is hurt and falls into a coma. But not without letting  Archer know, that a huge biochemical bomb has been placed in Downtown San  Francisco. A bomb big enough to destroy the entire city. The clock's  ticking, but nobody knows where. Sean Archer now gets a really advanced  surgery. The doctors are changing his look to the one of the killer. We now  follow Archer on the bonebreaking hunt between Troy's own men, in order to  locate the bomb threatening San Francisco with a terrible  armageddon.
John Woo did again. He managed to direct an exellent  motion-picture with two of the greatest actors ever - John Travolta and  Nicolas Cage.
I just love it.",929318400,,969,4.674556213017752

915458,3,6304618352,"An uncomfortable marriage of Woo's brand of violent melodrama and Hollywood assembly blockbuster, FACE/OFF is so out-there, loony, exciting, flimsy, bathetic, and occasionally profound that it would either leave you  breathless or bemused. The opening action blast-off and the final  mind-boggling boat chase sequence are pure Woo; maniacally choreographed,  they are somekind of religious celebration of montage, slow-motion, and  other barrages of techniques delivered with frightening dexterity. Cage is  great in his dual roles, perfect for Woo's operatic excesses, but Travolta  is a lightweight chipmunk. The film is shamelessly ludicrous,  scientifically and psychologically. You either draw a series of  ""Getouttahere"" blanks or get into it (I am somewhere in-between).  The anamorphically enhanced DVD looks superb, almost too perfect. The  soundtrack will give your system a good workout. Watch out for the bullet  ricochets. The lousy cheapskates at Paramount only give you a trailer. But  I'll bite.",919209600,,1011,5.8493150684931505
7875506,5,6304618352,My favorite John Woo movie. Travolta and Cage at their best. And playing each other's parts is eerie at times and laugh-out-loud funny at other times. It has some very emotional and moving scenes for an action film.,1526342400,,215,4.684210526315789

The DVD itself, I won't know until I watch it (right now it's on my DVD shelf).  If I were to watch it and the DVD itself is fine, that is no guarantee that ALL of the other DVDs that people may buy will be OK.
