8273449,1,B0019CULG6,"Truely terrible ""silent"" DVD.  A collection of 10 or so short german newsreels of wildly varying quality.  No narration, at all.  In one case that played band music over the original german audio.  Between each 5 minute newsreel Periscope Films displays the anti-piracy FBI screens telling you not to copy their public domain material.  Not any good for modellers as the more interesting the topic, the worse the quality of the newsreel.",1517616000,,437,5.013888888888889
