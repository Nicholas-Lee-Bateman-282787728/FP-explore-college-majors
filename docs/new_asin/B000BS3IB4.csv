8091795,5,B000BS3IB4,"I'm a big fan of Van Dammne I must have watched the first Bloodsport well over twenty times. When this movie was done back in 1987 the Martial Arts film community would never be the same ever again. By far this was Van Dammne's best film. I was a little upset when I found out that he would no-longer star in the series. However the other three movies weren't as bad as some of the other writers have said. I mean come on the movies just fit the times in which they were made. The collecter's edition is worth buying for two simple reasons. 1.) You get Van Dammne's greatest martial arts movie and 2.) You get three other Bloodsport movie for a very low price. You simply can't beat that, ""it's Bloodsport for crying out loud!""",1321228800,3,727,4.313868613138686
