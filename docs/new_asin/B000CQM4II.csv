2469073,5,B000CQM4II,"Hello I'm an autistic adult.

This is my review on Ed, Edd, N Eddy Volume 2.

Well I'm going to cut straight to the chase it's Ed, Edd, N Eddy.  I watched, liked it & got it for the bonus material on the dvd.

Buy this for the bonus material.  You'll enjoy it!",1199318400,2,260,3.830188679245283
2469074,2,B000CQM4II,I am a huge fan of this series.  This for the most part was a collection of the worst of the collection.  Wait until they put a better collection togather.,1168905600,,155,4.133333333333334
2469075,3,B000CQM4II,"6 Episodes -

If it Smells Like an Ed (2 parter)

Take this Ed and Shove It (2 parter)

One Size Fits Ed

A Case of Ed

Here's Mud in Your Ed

Fool on the Ed

Frankly, I am disappointed.  I admit it - I am an adult who for some reason likes this series.  Ed, Edd and Eddy seems to do best when they bend reality - for example, ""Dawn of the Eds"", ""One Plus One Equals Ed"" and ""Cry Ed"" for example.  If these ever came out on DVD, I'd be there to buy it!",1143417600,10,452,3.5670103092783507
2469076,5,B000CQM4II,I love this show and dvd beacuse the characters are so funny!  Buy it! ;),1142985600,,73,3.8666666666666667
2469077,5,B000CQM4II,"It's finally here; DVD volume two of ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"": Fool's Par-ED-ise !

This DVD has six more ED-isodes incuding two two-parters: ""If It Smells Like an ED""(where the Eds have been framed for something they haven't done) and ""Take This ED and Shove It""(where we get to see the characters as old people).

Other ED-isodes include the one where the Eds made Jimmy the size of a sumo wrestler and the time where they are pursued by a mysterious Prank Master.

Special features include ""The Plank Family Players"".  This features Plank and his parents in over ten sketches originally created for Fridays, Cartoon Network's Friday night block of premieres and much more.

Also in ""Special Features"", there's a behind-the-scenes look of the ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" video game !  You even get to meet the show's creator and take a look inside the AKA Cartoon studio ! Sweet !

Well, this seemed to be a tad more than I expected besides no Cartoon Network bonus cartoon(like ""Billy and Mandy"" or even ""Foster's"") or that other Ed music video entitled ""The Incredible Shrinking Day"" or something like that.  Perhaps in the next volume with more who-knows-what's-next ED-isodes.  I can't wait.",1142985600,4,1178,4.82089552238806
2469078,1,B000CQM4II,"I think we can gather from what we learned from previous releases of DVD's like this such as the Teen Titans random episode DVD's that were also released in volumes but by Season # tags. Now Teen Titans finally got a Full Season box, I think what Warner Brothers is doing is, there seeing if the DVD's sell and once they get clarification, they'll release the good full season box sets. Heck, Original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are still coming out only 12-13episodes each to each Volume Lions Gate releases, so I don't think we'll see a Full Season box from them either, probably because there was 10 seasons for TMNT and they want to milk off the profit from a 12 episode DVD that costs about $15.00 retail, and only 9.50 for an Amazon.com release. either way, they'll all make the money, heck, if they played there cards right, these boxsets would be worth $30.00 or even $39.99 depending on the number of episodes. Ed Edd n Eddy only have 26-12min episodes per season, making the entire season only 12-13 episodes. and right now were on our 5th Season so WB will probably want to milk EENE for everything it has...  yeah another long review LMAO",1139961600,2,1152,4.565217391304348

8100455,5,B000CQM4II,"My son used to watch Ed, EDD, N Eddy all the time but since the series ended, he kind of forgot about them.  Got him the 1st and 2nd series and his face lit up (he's 14).  We watched them on our driving trip to see relatives for the Holidays and seeing his face smiling warmed my heart.  Ed, Edd N Eddy are vulgar and yet funny...lol",1388361600,3,333,3.9402985074626864
