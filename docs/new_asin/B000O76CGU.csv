8183351,5,B000O76CGU,Outstanding instructor and programs.  Even the kids enjoy the workouts these programs provide and to be able to choose between 3 variations per DVD is great for those constrained by time.,1362009600,4,187,5.032258064516129
8183352,4,B000O76CGU,These are easy to use videos for yoga at home. My old quibble is that she doesn't always provide alternative poses if you can't or won't do the pose that she's using.  This is a better tool if you're already familiar with yoga and want to make up a missed class.,1361923200,,262,4.137254901960785

8183354,5,B000O76CGU,I loved following Ms Reed on PBS and was not happy when she was canceled. I was able to tape her program before it was canceled and had been following it 5 days a week. I am thrilled to have this series on DVD now. I love that the discs are all different. With these 3 plus the one for Athletes I feel I have a varied library that will keep me interested for years to come. I've discovered muscles that I forgot I had.,1280793600,7,418,3.929411764705882
