2697026,4,B000KQF6Z8,"So many stories of religious figures add Halos that make it all unbelievable to me but this telling of Patrick's story is well done, dramatic and informative.  I like a good rebel story and this story of Patrick delivers.  Patrick is played as an admirable hero.  If you are curious about where Patrick came from, how he won the hearts, respect of Ireland or how he lived this is a fine telling of the story. Casting Liam Neeson (from Belfast) is a brilliant touch of Irish magic.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Patrick/dp/B000KQF6Z8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Patrick</a>",1247011200,12,616,5.822222222222222
2697027,4,B000KQF6Z8,"Portrayal of Patrick's kidnapping to Ireland, followed by his escape, and returning home only to voluntarily return to Ireland.  Documentary style at times glosses over periods of his life while going into deeper detail of others.  Overall, conveys the material in an understandable way and who couldn't listen to Liam Neeson for hours!",1244937600,9,336,5.320754716981132
2697028,5,B000KQF6Z8,This video is an excellent reource on not only getting to know St. Patrick and the details and focus of his life but also as a resource of how to reach others with the Gospel of Christ.,1243123200,6,185,4.027027027027027
2697029,5,B000KQF6Z8,Very artistically and beautifully done.  There is so little primary documents on the legendary life of Patrick.  This docudrama has compensated with visuals from the Emerald Island and beautifully done photography.  The best DVD of Patrick that I have seen.,1234483200,17,257,5.375

8158693,5,B000KQF6Z8,"I have always been a very die hard St. Patricks Day fan, but in my later years have felt a strong desire to learn more about the man and my wife and I can add this to our standard viewing every year now at this time of Year.  Truly a remarkable man and the simplest point I think that often is not made when people speak of Saint Patrick is made - not one man, Saint or otherwise, has ever brought an entire nation of barbaric people to Christ.  He did it all by himself.  Definitely one of the most remarkable me of all time.",1393891200,2,526,3.9904761904761905
8158694,4,B000KQF6Z8,"As has been said, this DVD is most likely the best documentary on Ireland's patron Saint that has been made to date.

As has been said elsewhere, for one of the best-known saints, most people actually know very little about St. Patrick, Ireland's Patron Saint. This film should serve as a nice corrective to that. Forget the green beer and ""Kiss Me, I'm Irish"" buttons. This is the *real* inspiration behind St. Patrick's Day.

Thankfully the film stays away from the subsequent myths and legends that grew up around Patrick (such as his driving the snakes out of Ireland; there were no snakes in Ireland when he arrived there) and focuses upon what we actually know about Patrick from ancient British and Irish historians as well as, primarily, from the Saint's two extant writings, his *Confessio,* similar to St. Augustine's *Confessions* and written near the end of Patrick's life, and the *Letter to Coroticus,* in which Patrick excommunicates a British chieftain named Coroticus who had kidnapped and enslaved a group of new converts of Patrick's.

The documentary by award-winning director Pamela Mason Wagner, filmed entirely on location in Ireland, features an award-winning soundtrack and takes viewers through Patrick's life, from the teenage boy Patriciius' capture in his Roman Britain by Irish slavers and being sold into slavery, to his eventual escape from Ireland after receiving a vision from God, to his entrance into holy orders, to his return to Ireland as missionary-bishop (he replaced Bishop Palladius), his letter of excommunication of Coroticus, continuing on to his writing of his Confession, and eventual death.

The film features lengthy interviews and commentary with/by Patrician scholars such as Sister Maire B. de Paor (*Patrick: Pilgrim Apostle of Ireland*), Philip Freeman (*Saint Patrick of Ireland: A Biography*), and Pultizer-Prize winning Irish author Frank McCourt (*Angela's Ashes*).

The narration is done by Irish-American actor Liam Neeson (*Schindler's List*) with Gabriel Byrne (*The Usual Suspects*) as the voice of Patrick.

This is a great movie for personal viewing, or a family devotional but would also work well in a church setting if your congregation has A-V equipment to show movies.

I really can't recommend this film highly enough.",1366848000,6,2290,5.30939226519337

Find out what the Irish do on St Patrick's day, no parade floats involved!",1363996800,,145,4.178571428571429
8158696,5,B000KQF6Z8,Very good.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the life of St. Patrick and the trials of his time.  A good example of a man turning his life toward Jesus Christ.,1363305600,2,180,4.114285714285714
8158697,4,B000KQF6Z8,"Teaching Catechism, this video is a great tool for giving my kids correct history about this great man. They can learn that St. Patrick's Day is not all about ""green beer and potatos and partying.""",1325289600,,197,4.6571428571428575
8158698,4,B000KQF6Z8,"This was different than I thought it was when I bought it. I had thought that Liam Neeson was playing ""himself"" (meaning the Bishop of Armagh). He narrates the documentary. This is an informative film of about 1 hour's length, and should be useful for schools, or for Irish American parents who are trying to reconnect with the auld sod, or instill some sense of heritage in their children. Enjoy, and may you be in heaven an hour before the devil knows you're dead.",1270857600,4,466,4.559523809523809
