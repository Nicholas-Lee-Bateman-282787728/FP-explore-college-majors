6453742,5,B00KY45GLA,"GREAT weight loss, with these 3 dvds and 1200 calories a day and a desk job I lost, 87lbs and kept them off for 8 months now. I can't dance and these are easy to follow, smooth and upbeat music. Combo pack w express workout lets you mix up for the time you have that day, some day I bearly have 20 minutes some days I get up early and have over an hr for a workout.  Boy friend has fun listening to the commands from the neighboring room, but then I remind him that guy helped me get the new body and he looks me up n down and just smiles and walks away.",1428105600,6,554,3.8173913043478263
6453743,2,B00KY45GLA,these are okay for recovery days for me. They are not as cardio intense as I thought they would be,1426723200,,98,3.95
6453744,5,B00KY45GLA,"Guillermo Gomez is a wonderful instructor. All of his kickboxing DVDs are worth their weight in gold. I have been doing his kickboxing routines for about a month and I've already lost 15 pounds! I feel much stronger and my clothes are just falling off. It's so exciting to see progress so fast; it's motivating. That's why I ordered this 3 pack dvd set, because I was already doing kickboxing cardio blast and I loved it so much that I decided to get these to have a variety of combos to do. I'm glad that I did because I love kickboxing cardio burn even more. It's my favorite of all of his workout DVDs. I'Ll update on my progress in about a month, but I am losing fat and inches like crazy!",1426464000,2,693,4.257575757575758

6453748,5,B00KY45GLA,Excellent workout on all three dvds. I love the fact that he ques the upcoming moves seemlessly. Not all instructors have that gift for timing. I recommend this product for anyone who wants a good cardio workout with some variety in moves and length of session.,1417219200,,261,4.695652173913044

6453750,3,B00KY45GLA,I was hoping this was something I could do with the punching bag and not just a workout dvd.,1473811200,,92,3.8947368421052633
6453751,4,B00KY45GLA,"Great workout, order was fulfilled quickly",1472342400,,42,6.166666666666667
6453752,5,B00KY45GLA,These workouts are fantastic for beginners. You will definitely work up a sweat.,1469923200,,80,5.230769230769231
6453753,4,B00KY45GLA,"Overall I really like this set. One of the DVD's doesn't have the best sound quality but it's not so horrible that it drives you crazy. It just seems like the sound could have been leveled a bit better. All three are a great workout. The dance one is not much different from the others so I would use the term ""dance"" loosely. Also the woman on the right that is doing the workout with him is terribly annoying. Anyway, I would still recommend this set. I have another one of his videos that is more recent and really enjoy that one as well. I get a great workout with all of them and would buy his videos again.",1468454400,3,612,4.151260504201681

6453755,5,B00KY45GLA,Love his workouts tried them all on xfinity first on on-demand.,1457136000,,63,4.818181818181818
6453756,5,B00KY45GLA,"These DVDs provide fun, high-energy workouts and even a joke or two. I highly recommend them if you're looking for good cardio routines.",1454112000,,136,4.956521739130435
6453757,4,B00KY45GLA,"My favorite remains Guillermo's Kickboxing Cardio Blast DVD workout. This set is really good for someone who is starting kickboxing, for learning the basics, but I needed a workout that is more intense, faster moving, longer lasting. I still use these DVDs once in a while. All are still excellent options, especially if you add wrist and ankle weights.",1453593600,2,353,5.0
6453758,5,B00KY45GLA,"I bought this set partly because I love Jessica Smith, and was expecting to see her leading some of the exercises.  No go - she only appears in two and then only as a background person.  However, Guillermo Gomez more than makes up for it.  He keeps you moving constantly, cues very well (sometimes in Spanish, which is kindof fun for this Anglo gal), and gives just enough useful information about kickboxing to make me feel like I'm building skill in addition to strength and stamina.

It's a pricey set, but worth every penny.  All three workouts immediately made it into my regular rotation. One thing I will add is that I have purchased weighted gloves to use with these workouts.  The workouts are cardio focused and I want a little more strength training to go along with that.

My fitness level: intermediate, My kickboxing level: beginner",1446681600,13,846,4.714285714285714
8662554,4,B00KY45GLA,So far so good! Don't really enjoy the instructors accent but he is very good to follow. I'm a beginner in kickboxing but have done martial arts for many years. This is a great workout for me and fun too.,1525046400,,204,4.125
8662555,4,B00KY45GLA,Love these videos. its great as its easy to follow as he works up to the moves so you remember them and are not fumbling all over the place like most kickboxing.,1522195200,,161,4.0625
8662556,5,B00KY45GLA,I learned how to fight I love it,1522108800,,32,3.125
8662557,5,B00KY45GLA,"Perfect for me.  Being a senior, the pace is easy to follow and gives me the right amount of cardio exercise without high impact.",1512000000,,129,4.375

8662561,1,B00KY45GLA,"popped in one of the discs & there's no intro. No warm up. Looks like they hit record before they were aware of it. The pace is way too fast! A significant gripe about 'workout' DVDs these days, not much communication on what's coming up. There's no pointers to ensure your form.",1479081600,,279,4.384615384615385
8662562,5,B00KY45GLA,"Love this video!! You sweat!! I love how Guillermo lets you know what's going on throughout the video and is on time with each instruction! He doesn't do alot of babbling like other instructors either.  I love how I feel after doing his workouts, he makes you feel like you've accomplished something and you see results too!!",1477612800,,325,4.701754385964913
8662563,5,B00KY45GLA,"I've been doing these workouts for several years when they are on Time Warner cable. I love them! I know most of the moves, but can push myself at different levels depending on how I'm feeling. The bonus kickboxing portion is perfect for days when I don't have much time but want to squeeze in a workout.",1475020800,,304,4.350877192982456
