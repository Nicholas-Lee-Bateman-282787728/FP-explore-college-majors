I am now waiting for this to come out in colour and on DVD then I will also add it to my collection.
Thanks to Amazon for providing all the golden oldies keep it up a very satified customer Thanks again for a great service.",1026345600,4,440,4.127906976744186
727878,4,6303929966,"I really like this film.  OK, the plot isn't brilliant but when it comes to Deanna Durbin and her amazing voice, you won't find a much better film than this.
The 'Russian Medley' and 'Nessun Dorma' are fantastic - I'm in awe when I listen.
The film revolves around Ann Carter (Durbin) going to stay with her brother, Martin (Pat O'Brien) a rather shady character who's told her he's better off than he actually is.
She wants to make it bigtime as a singer and when she learns that her brother's boss, Charles Gerard (Franchot Tone) is a famous songwriter/playwright she gets herself hired by him as a maid.
What follows is quite an amusing film where she constantly tries to sing for Gerard, but keeps getting prevented.  Of course, then she falls for him and he her, but, Martin, doesn't like it and decides to ruin the day.
Add to the mix about seven butlers from the other households within the apartment building who develop a crush on her and do their utmost to please her and aggravate each other and you've got yourself quite a funny movie.
True, the plot and writing isn't a great standard, but it's still a very charming, feel good film that's very easy to watch.
A definite must for all fans of Ms. Durbin.",1000684800,16,1216,4.497737556561086
727879,5,6303929966,"Though hailed as one of her hits from the 40's, the film itself is routine and makes her up to be this goddess figure through the film (all 7 of  the butlers hopelessly fall in love with her) and having Franchot Tone as her  leading man did not help matters either.  On the Lux Radio program, Robert  Paige had played the role (her co-star in ""CAN'T HELP SINGING"")  and seem to be a much better choice, but his name was not big enough as  yet--(it never got any bigger either).  However, this happens to be one of  my favorite Durbin picture, since this is the first ""grown-up""  film I have ever seen of hers.  She is simply gorgeous in the film  (possibly the prettiest, despite the fact that they gave her 3 different  eyebrows..one thicker, one pencil-thin (a left over from her previous film  HERS TO HOLD), and the third one in-between.  Watch the first number, her  eyebrows change in mid-song, twice!) and the songs are all out of this  world.  IN THE SPIRIT OF THE MOMENT, WHEN YOU'RE AWAY, RUSSIAN MEDLEY, and  finally, NESSUN DORMA (The Prince).  Great selection for a fabulous talent.  The British people would kill me if they read this review, since this film  is a cult classic over there, but let's be honest about the script.  It is  Hollywood fluff.  But it is also extremely enjoyable, and I do remember not  being able to keep my eyes off the screen for a second. It is simply  wonderful as an entertainment piece. So, despite what anyone says, I would  say it is one of her best.",942019200,21,1498,4.451851851851852
727945,5,6303929966,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It was different to most of the other Durbin's pictures, so I appreciated this difference. The music and songs by Durbin were great as usual and there is good acting throughout the movie.",1362268800,,219,4.641025641025641
727946,5,6303929966,"Recently the Stanford Theater showed all of the Deanna Durbin movies. I consider myself an old movie buff, however I had never heard of Deanna Durbin!

I was in the balcony with my wife enjoying the movie having no clue there was any singing.  When Deanna began to sing I dropped my popcorn and choked on my Diet Coke!  She sings like an angel!

I was only in town for a few days but watched every Deanna Durbin movie they had.

His Butler's Sister is very enjoyable and one of Deanna's best movies.

The PAL R2 DVD played perfectly on my U.S. multi-region DVD player. Excellent picture and sound.",1360454400,,597,4.431192660550459
727947,5,6303929966,"I think there were two big reasons why folks today recall Judy Garland more clearly than Deanna Durbin. One is that Judy Garland's brand of music was more accessible to the audience. The other is that Deanna Durbin elected to quit the film industry at right around the height of her career when she was only 27 years old. Oh, okay, there's a chance that Garland may also have been the better actress. But Deanna will always have a warm place in the hearts of those who relish her old movies, back when she was a fresh-faced teen going around nonchalantly saving studio companies from ruination. For those who aren't too dang cool to occasionally listen to classical music, Deanna was the shiznit. She was the sweetest soprano, and with marvelous range.

HIS BUTLER'S SISTER is one of Deanna Durbin's latter films, and also one of her most entertaining (although, to come clean, I find all of her pictures highly watchable). At the time of its theater release in 1943, Deanna was only days away from her 22nd birthday, and she looks quite lovely. She plays Ann Carter, an aspiring singer who takes the train to New York to stay with her rich half-brother Martin and to make a go at a music career. Except that Martin (Pat O'Brien) isn't really rich at all, but rather a butler - and a horse race gambler - working for the renowned music composer Charles Gerard (a suave Franchot Tone). To Martin's chagrin, Ann promptly gets herself hired on as a housemaid in Gerard's household. Even though Charles Gerard is notorious for loathing sitting thru auditions, Ann is determined to have him listen to her perform, never mind that her disapproving brother seeks to curtail her every opportunity (dude doesn't want to lose his cushy job).

There's a fun madcap flavor to this movie, kicked off by the opening train sequence in which a pair of brassy ladies calling themselves the Sunshine Twins perform the comic number ""Is It True What They Say About Dixie?"" for the put-upon Charles Gerard. Durbin herself sings several nice songs, including ""In the Spirit of the Moment,"" Victor Herbert's ""When You're Away,"" ""None Shall Sleep (""Nessun Dorma"" in English),"" and even a medley of Russian folk songs (including ""Two Guitars""). More comedy relief presents itself in the form of the other squabbling manservants of assorted nationalities (including Amir Tamiroff as a Russian butler), all of whom are smitten with Durbin's character. Not only can Ann sing up a storm, she also possesses ""pers"" - as one sleazy show producer is won't to say - but what he means, of course, is ""poise."" Me, I'm sold. Deanna Durbin is beguiling in an unaffected way.

The plot draws out the suspense by persisting in obstructing Durbin and Franchot Tone's romance, with O'Brien - who here is kind of a heel - serving as the biggest impediment. Deanna keeps trying to audition for Franchot but, time after time, when Durbin does grace the screen with her singing, Franchot Tone would be in the next room, admiring the warbling but unable to identify Durbin as the author of that splendid voice. In one instance, he even attributes Deanna's singing ""When You're Away"" as being piped thru from a broken radio. It all eventually ends well, thanks to the elegant Butler's Ball. Except that, in the Butler's Ball, I wonder who waited on the guests, who took in the coats?

Awesomely, this DVD also comes with the classic 1936 musical short ""Every Sunday,"" featuring Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland. ""Every Sunday"" essentially served as the screen test for these two girls. The plot revolves around Durbin and Garland coming to the rescue of a music professor whose ill-attended concerts at the park are threatened to be shut down. Durbin recorded the aria ""Il Bacio"" for this one, with Garland belting out the specialty number ""The Americana."" For the big finish, the girls duet to a reprise of ""The Americana."" ""Every Sunday"" is a must-see for fans of both Durbin and Garland.",1312070400,6,3941,4.799705449189985
727948,4,6303929966,"One of Deanna Durbin's best movies of the period, HIS BUTLER'S SISTER (1943) features the adorable songbird in a comedic story of mixed identities and showbusiness dreams. Co-starring with Franchot Tone, one of her most formidable and appealing leading men, Deanna shines brightly here!

Stagestruck teen Ann Carter (Deanna Durbin) gets off the train in New York city, and goes to stay with her rich older brother (Pat O'Brien) in his ritzy penthouse apartment.

In fact, I'm only negative about the leads....Pat O'Brian (not funny at all, it should have been William Bendix) and Franchot Tone who looks ridiculous and acts worse.  Rarely did Deanna get the leading men she deserved.

727952,4,6303929966,"...more like it! Deanna gives a lovely performance in a mid war film which is the reason fake food was used as the disclosure at the beginning of the film tells us. This film features the second teaming of Deanna and Franchot Tone which reminds me of his several teamings with Jean Harlow. In fact this film is a nice way to view Franchot ten years after his first teaming with Harlow in 1933's Bombshell. While still handsome, his youthful shine is gone. Deanna on the other hand has her eyebrows experimented on in this film. The thinner the uglier imo. This film was Deanna's truer entry into adulthood before Christmas Holiday and after It Started With Eve. The butler in this film is played by Pat O'Brien and he excels. Its a charming film worth your time if only for one of the best endings in Deanna's short film history. Sweet songs round out this enjoyable film.",1145750400,2,872,4.525316455696203
727953,3,6303929966,"His Butler's Sister is the story of a girl (Deanna Durbin) who wants more than anything to become a famous singer. She goes to visit her brother in New York who has just sent her $1000; she assumes he must be rich and living with him might be able to help her meet the right people. When she arrives, she sees that he is not rich at all; he is a butler employed by a rich man who happens to work hiring singers (Franchot Tone). Disappointed but unfazed, the girl decides to move in and serve as the new maid until she can get her employer's attention. Her brother is completely against this, telling her she can in no way sing around their employer because he hates it and will turn her out. The girl quickly gains popularity because of her vibrant personality. She even wins over her boss. In the end, all is well; she succeeds as a singer without his help and lands him on top of everything.

The film opens with a very funny dance number in a train. Two of the women have learned of Tone's characters whereabouts and have planned a routine to show off their nasal voices. Tone himself is funny as the horribly naive employer who bustles around as if nothing strange is happening right outside his bedroom door. The butler is fiercely protective of his little sister and sometimes quite mean to her. The real star of the show is Deanna Durbin, a talented singer with a powerful, slightly annoying operatic voice. Luckily, much of the plot revolves around her not being able to sing. She has a knack for comedy as shown by her dead-pan expression, but she is no knockout beauty with her chubby cheeks and plain-Jane face. Her personality makes up for it though, and she snags several male followers.

This videotape also includes previews for other tapes in the second Deanna Durbin collection and a theatrical trailer for His Butler's Sister, a film with a few laughs, operatic songs, and a mediocre plot.",1127088000,,1907,4.524637681159421
727954,5,6303929966,"This endearing film from director Frank Borzage is filled with the warmth and charm of its star, Deanna Durbin. An original screenplay fashioned for Deanna by Samuel Hoffenstein and Beth Reinhardt and a glossy production from Universal really make this one of Deanna's best films. A great cast which includes Franchot Tone, Pat O'Brien, Akim Tamiroff and Elsa Janssen lend sparkling support to Deanna's joyous performance as Ann Carter.

Ann is on her way from Indiana to New York by train to live with her rich half-brother while she tries to become a broadway musical star. She wants to sing for composer Charles Gerard (Franchot Tone) and just misses her chance when she finds out he is on her train. When her half-brother Martin (Pat O'Brien) turns out to be only a butler, her hopes sink low until she discovers he is the butler in the swanky New York penthouse of you know who!

Martin plays the ponies more than he works but since his main job is keeping away girls who want to sing for Charles Gerard, he has his hands full. It gets even more complicated when Gerard mistakes Ann for the new maid and she is right under Gerard's nose and Martin's feet! Elsa Janssen is wonderful as the housekeeper Severena, who takes a shine to the sweet Ann. She isn't the only one, however, taken with Ann's smile and effervescence.

Some very funny moments are given birth from Ann's effect on every butler in the building. They are all enamored of her and do everything they can to compete for her affections. Akim Tamiroff is foremost of these as Martin's Russian pal Popoff. Ann of course, begins to fall for her boss Gerard who is about to dump his latest work and run off to Maine with his society girlfriend Elizabeth Campbell (Evelyn Ankers).

She finally gets to sing but in an only in the movies mix-up Charles thinks it was the radio. When they do get together she forgets all about the music and the two fall in love. But her brother feels threatened and also thinks Gerard might just be fooling around. This causes Charles to make plans for Maine again, but true love may make him stay.

Tone is excellent as the wealthy but down to earth Gerard and Deanna simply glows in fashions by Adrian. A walk home holding hands and a kiss goodnight are filled with romance and magic, as is this film. There are, of course, some wonderful musical interludes, including ""Nessun Dorma"" from Puccini's ""Turnadot"" and the beautiful ""In the Spirit of the Moment.""

This sweet fable of ""the day before yesterday"" as it calls itself is a must for Deanna's fans and a fine film in its own right. A real gem from the last rose of summer, Deanna Durbin.",1121644800,8,2640,4.5826271186440675

Most don't know that she was once Hollywood's top paid actress before she decided to quit the movie business because of (in her words) limited and unimaginative scripts.  In this movie, she is the sister of a butler who works for a well to do song writer.  Any brother who had a sister like this would have been trying to help her with her dream, but not this brother.... does not make a lot of since, but then does a 180 and changes once she sings.  But in a scene towards the end, she sings a song in Russian that really shows the exquisite talent that this lovely lady.... the song, her expressions, her body language, and her attire in this one scene are probably the most beautiful off all of her movies... that scene alone, in my opinion, is worth buying the movie... if you can find it.

I've owned a VHS copy for years but recently purchased the DVD import through Rare Imports. It was clearly labeled on the outside of the cover wrap to let you know that the menu is in Portuguese and that they happily accept returns. Since it also said the voices were in English, I went ahead and opened it.
The first time I played it, I was disappointed as I couldn't figure out the Portuguese enough to turn off the subtitles and the speaking voices sounded as though they were talking in a barrel. I wrote to Rare Imports and they were very responsive, first helping me turn off the subtitles [I didn't realize there is a button on the remote to do that, duh] and then offering to send another copy or take the movie back.
Once the subtitles were off and I played the movie all the way through, the voices got better and all the other sounds were very good quality, including all the music. I decided to keep it and be thankful that I now have it available to me on DVD. No other seller has it available for this price.
