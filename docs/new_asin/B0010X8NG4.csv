8239186,3,B0010X8NG4,"Kirby is cute as always. Like the other Kirby DVD I reviewed it's okay, but still a little wierd. It is good, because of Kirby, the villains, Meta Knight being good, so I guess I reccomend this.",1359331200,,194,4.27027027027027

8239191,5,B0010X8NG4,"I loved the anime since I was younger, I was looking all over for the other DVDS. But were taken out of print when Foxbox changed to 4Kids TV. This has episodes 1-7 on the DVD. It was well worth the money for this DVD. They have taken the Kirby anime off 4kids TV. It is spectacular they put these DVDS up again, and from my knowledge, they will release the whole series on DVD!
I give this a 5 out of 5. Great for fans of the anime, Kirby games, and Nintendo collectors!",1203638400,8,471,4.0212765957446805
