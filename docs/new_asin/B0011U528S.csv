It deserves restoration. It is pan and scan so in many scenes you lose the actors and only hear dubbed dialogue.
The original french language version would do much to enhance the enjoyment of the film.",1334707200,,317,4.781818181818182
8242323,2,B0011U528S,"""Banana Peel"" is a good French comedy by Marcel Ophuls,(son of Max!) excellently interpreted by some great actors such as J.P.Belmondo, Jeanne Moreau, Gert Froebe, J.P.Marielle and others, unfortunately it suffers from having been badly recorded on DVD. The DVD is most likely a copy of the VHS version. This good film deserves a better treatment and should have been remastered from the original. At least there is a version of it on DVD which has not yet been released in France",1207267200,6,480,4.865853658536586
