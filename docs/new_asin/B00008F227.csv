1841764,3,B00008F227,"The Man Called Flintstone was a feature length movie released in 1966 with the original Flintstones cast and voices.
The movie itself is mildly entertaining and places the characters in a spy type setting which reflected the era's craze for the 007 movies. It is a must for all serious collectors of Flintstone or Hanna Barbera animation ,and is a welcome sign that the vaults are finally being flung open. Now if only the Groovy Ghoulies or Atom Ant would see the light of day!!",1096848000,2,479,4.647058823529412
1841765,4,B00008F227,"When The Flintstones were cancelled in 1966, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera gave the stone-age family a giant send off with this full-length feature film. Fred Flintstone becomes a secret agent and travels through Europe to capture the Green Goose, all the while trying to keep it a secret from Wilma and the Rubbles.

Seems like a long version of the TV series, but with better animation and better music. You'll have a Yabba-Dabba-Doo time!",1094515200,,444,4.92
1841766,5,B00008F227,"For some reason, this great full length animated feature is long out of print, and has never been released on DVD.  It is a real shame.  A MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE is great.  The film (from 1966) features a Fred Flinstone look-a-like, secret agent ROCK SLAG.  As you probably guessed, Fred becomes mistaken for the secret agent, and gets mixed up in a hilarious adventure instead of the quiet vacation that he had intended.  I don't want to give too much away in case you haven't seen it. A highly recommended classic!",1079136000,,515,4.615384615384615

1841911,3,B00008F227,"In its Television history,""THE FLINTSTONES"" was a first,being that it was among the the few animated TV shows running on Primetime,and Hanna-Barbera Productions and Screen Gems Television,decades before SONY had reinstated the former TV subsidiary,were a rewarding association in the 1960s. and after running on ABC-TV from 1960 to 1966,and later reran on NBC Saturday mornings in 1967 and eventually in TV syndication,it was no big surprise that Hanna-Barbera hadn't given up on its most valued asset. released in late 1966,""THE MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE"" was a family,fun-filled full-length movie,that was a great joy to watch! but decades after its 1966 release,""THE MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE"" had also become the victim of very BAD editing,as Hanna-Barbera had just changed hands from being owned by Taft Broadcasting to Ted Turner's Turner Entertainment,which eventually became part of Warner Bros. Entertainment following the merger with Turner and Time Warner. and during this corporate process,somebody decided to edit this feature-length cartoon film,which is absolutely unforgivable! with Hanna-Barbera's history with Screen Gems,the full-length movie was released by Columbia Pictures,and the parties in question had chosen to delete the COLUMBIA opening with ""Wilma Flinstone"" as the COLUMBIA lady with the Torch,and that was unforgivably stupid! so anyone here,who expected to see the full length
animated movie in it's original form,will be seriously disappointed! either Turner or Warners made this seriously flawed edit job,and anyone who remembers the cartoon movie will plainly notice the bad editing-it was horrible! as we all know,Columbia Pictures and all its known subsidiaries became the property of the Japan owned SONY in 1989,which was a then-controversial move! in the 26 years of the SONY ownership,Columbia has pretty much been in name only,as SONY and its American executives foolishly chose to establish SONY as ""Sony Pictures"" and ""Sony Pictures Television"",which is culturally criminal! SONY is a major commercial name in the Electronics business world,and known throughout the Globe. Columbia Pictures is also,or was once a commercially known Hollywood studio-and,like Warner Bros.,both these studios are commercially known throughout the world! so for whatever reason that they edited The Flintstone's very first movie,it was in seriously bad taste and a major disappointment to serious fans of The Flintstones in their vintage years,and i recommend a simple warning-if you buy this DVD as i did,do NOT expect an accurate film,especially with such flawed and bad editing! given both SONY and Warner Bros. corporate positions,it was totally unacceptable that neither of these studios took the time to uphold an accurate and unedited movie as ""THE MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE"" seriously deserved! otherwise,the feature length Hanna-Barbera production was a total joy to watch,with Ted Nichols' great music soundtrack,as the cartoon spoofed the spy craze fad of the 60s,as well as hearing the unmistakable voices of Paul Frees and June Forray,along with the original Flintstone voice over cast Alan Reed,Jr and Mel Blanc,with Jean Vander Pyl and Gerry Johnson,and Harvey Korman. the cartoon movie was broadcast on ABC in mid 1971,and was syndicated over the next two decades,before being victimized by seriously inept editing,so i'd only recommend this DVD for seriously true cartoon fans who don't mind these particular flaws!",1480464000,,3445,5.652509652509653

How devastating to a small child.  In order to make up for the disappointment he experience in childhood, I decided to order this movie from Amazon and have my son give it to him as a Christmas gift. I thought it would touch the child inside him and maybe help to give him some closure.  You should have seen the smile on his face. I knew it touched his heart and help him to write an new page to that childhood memory years ago.

If you are a Flintstones fan then you will enjoy this movie.  The only drawback is strange scene sequence involving Pebbles and Bam Bam. I wish that they would do an edited version and take this sequence out because it detracts from the picture. This scene should have been left on the editing floor. It would have been better just to have shown them simply playing together if the movie producers needed to stretch the movie and also give the children more scene time.

1842297,3,B00008F227,"Since I didn't see this movie in its original incarnation - as a theatrical release by Columbia Pictures - I'm not stressing very hard over not seeing Wilma filling in for the Columbia torch bearer (although it would be a cool thing to see).  But as a home DVD release by Warner Bros., the company that now owns the Hanna Barbera library, this is a nice little movie that pads out the original series, which ran on ABC from 1961 to 1966.

In the movie, Fred Flintstone (voiced by Alan Reed) winds up filling in for a top-level secret agent who goes down due to injuries on the job.  His mission, which allows him to take his family and friends with him on a European vacation, finds him trying to stop a deadly new missile from starting a war.  But finding that missile puts some strain on his marriage to Wilma (Jean Vander Pyl), his best friend Barney (Mel Blanc), and his wife Betty (Gerry Johnson).  Sure, it's a bit cheesy, especially with the musical interludes that are sprinkled through the first half of the picture, but it definitely fits in with the spy shows of the era, including ""Get Smart"" and ""The Man From UNCLE"".  And the Great Gazoo, Fred and Barney's friend from their final season, is nowhere to be found in this flick - definitely a plus for those of us who thought Fred and Barney could get along just fine without an alien presence.

""The Man Called Flintstone"" is a movie for those who are fans of the old TV series.  Although it can be watched as a standalone offering, it will make a bit more sense watching it after you've seen a few episodes of the series.",1339977600,,1585,4.404109589041096

Oh well, I purchased the VHS and it was intact. This movie is something like the Flintstones episode with Madame Yes, great movie. I like the dancing scene and the scene when Fred and Wilma was Romeo and Juliet, very funny, Fred just couldn't get over that balcony, poor Fred, he wind up getting supernatural help.

1842303,4,B00008F227,"If you enjoyed ""Hey there, it's Yogi Bear!"", then you will like ""A Man Called Flintstone."" Of course the strategy here is quite different formula from regular TV series antics, and swift story plots. Here Fred is involved with reluctantly becoming involved in spy mystery mostly because he highly resembles the out of commission super spy good guy.
Hence the film rolls thru his adventures at accepting the job for a paid trip to Europe along with Wilma, Betty, Barney, & family minus the pets left at home. Here he has to juggle his secret mission with his family affair which presents the main thread of comedy. The animation is first rate for Hanna Barbra fans, and there are many songs woven in, some very good.
The movie promises action sequences, mysterious exotic women, bad guy thugs, and an evil villain who masterminds the whole affair.
One thing for sure, it could have been worse since I have seen many a movie based on regular TV show characters, and were noticably offbeat in comedy, story, and pure entertainmant.  Man Called Flintstone is a great addition to animation collectors, as well as kids today who can appreciate truely great cartoons, no matter what erea they were built, even in the stone ages!",1237075200,,1221,4.786729857819905
1842304,5,B00008F227,"First, the one star review:

The difference between the Flintstones T.V. show and the Flintstones movie is huge, and left me with the impression that the writers of the movie never once watched an episode of the T.V. series.

The characters in the movie are vastly different from the characters in the T.V. show.  Wilma, Betty, and Barney are barely in the movie, and when they are, they do not do any of the classic kind of Wilma, Betty, and Barney things.  They are there simply to move the plot along.  (They also have Barney chase after a pretty nurse in the beginning, which is not something that the T.V. Barney would do.)

It is the difference between the movie Fred and the T.V. Fred that sinks this movie.  The character of the movie Fred has nothing to do with the T.V. Fred.  The movie Fred does not get mad, threaten people, scheme to get away with things, yell, or even argue.  The Fred Flintstone in this move is a watered down character, combine that with a dull plot, and crummy song and dance numbers, and it all adds up to a waste of time.

If you were looking at buying this movie to fill out your Flintstones collection, I would recommend you save your money - this is not the Flintstones.

The five star review:

My five star reviews is for The Flintstones as a movie for younger children.  Several reviewers noted that their children love the movie, which makes a lot of sense.  I remember as a young child not liking the Flintstones T.V. show because Fred was always mad, and always yelling at people.  I was too young to understand that this was part of the joke.  It was not until later, watching the show as an adult, that I got a lot of the humor.  That is when I became a fan of the show.

The Fred in this movie is a likeable guy that ends up in a bad situation through no fault of his own.  Fred is not a character to poke fun at, as he is in the T.V. series, instead he is someone to root for against the bad guys.  He is not yelling at people, arguing with his wife, or plotting to get away with things.  The plot is dull for an adult, but what is dull for an adult is straightforward and easy for a child to understand.  There is also the added bonus of nothing too scary, or suspenseful, in the movie for a young child.  I think this movie is actually better than the majority of Walt Disney films, in that no one dies, and the suspense is not too drawn out.  (To this day, I still do not understand why Disney believes little kids want to watch films that include overly drawn out suspense, or the death of a friend, mother, or loved one.  It is a child's film, for Pete's sake.)

On a side note, the animation in this movie is far better than the T.V. show.  There' s none of those  world famous Hanna Barbara `repeating background'  scenes, where the characters would walk, run, or drive, past the same scenery again and again.  The animation for the backgrounds, the locations, and the characters, is all high quality, and beautifully done, with warm rich colors.  There is not that overly bright quality that is used in the animation of most children's cartoons.",1235779200,9,3101,4.331597222222222
1842305,5,B00008F227,I was very glad to see that it has finally come out on DVD.  I have been looking for it for a long time.,1231459200,2,104,3.3333333333333335

1842367,5,B00008F227,"In the midst of the mid- 'sixties spy craze came this 90 minute feature length film. It was Hanna- Barbera's second theatrical feature, the first being Hey There, It's Yogi Bear. Everything good about the Flintstones to date found its way into this 1966 movie, but this Columbia release (now Warner Bros.) also features seven songs and two different animation looks in the opening and closing title sequences. HB, to their credit, kept the loved look of the long running prime time TV show for the entire feature. The DVD release was held up for a long time due to various debacles, but amazingly, this release managed to keep the cel-look cover art, while the back features three title cards used in theaters.

The film is in English with French and Spanish subtitles, but other than that, there are no extra features, which seems surprising, but perhaps an enhanced version will be released if this one does well. All the classic characters are here: Alan Reed as Fred, Mel Blanc as Barney, Jean Vanderpyl as Wilma, Gerry Johnson as Betty, not to mention June Foray, Harvey Korman, Paul Frees, Don Messick, and Janet Waldo. The Man Called Flintstone, coming two years later, is more developed than Hey There, Yogi Bear, which is also a musical, and which also gave the HB art department a chance to experiment with different visual styles in the musical numbers.

This is a delightful film, well-drawn, fast paced, well-plotted, with the usual cartoon conundrums and domestic dilemmas, drawing to a satisfying denoument. In other words, three times the length, but following the formula of every Flintstones episode. Here though, the genius of this cartoon, in writing, character, and story, clearly shines, whereas in the episodes, it's easily taken for granted. The film clips right by, whereas another well-known HB feature, The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones, which runs two hours instead of 90 minutes, seems to drag. Flintstones fans, cartoon lovers, and animation buffs won't want to miss The Man Called Flintstone.",1229817600,29,2022,5.0148809523809526
1842368,5,B00008F227,"Haven't seen the DVD yet, but I own an old VHS copy of it I transferred over to DVD. It's a family staple; as kids it used to air annually on (I think) ABC in 2 halves, one half on Thanksgiving Day and the second the day after. Everything you love about Flintstones - the physical gags, the Fred-Can't-Do-Anything-Right bumbling, the great cartoon voice-over work from the original cast plus Harvey Korman & June Foray, the ""eh, it's a living"" use of prehistoric animals (who knew so many of them could speak perfect English, it really IS Intelligent design!) - it's just all done up a little bigger, with Fred being recruited by the goverment to finish an assignment started by a secret agent (who happens to be Fred's double, and quite a hit with the female spy set...meee-yowwww). And the assignment is coinciding with the Flintstones' & Rubbles' joint vacation, & Fred's not allowed to tell anyone else what's going on.

1842369,5,B00008F227,"I just received a copy of ""A Man Called Flintstone"" on DVD and at first I was a bit worried to see what was missing from the original release. True fans of this film will remember that the very opening of the film we see Wilma in place of the lady as the symbol for the Columbia Pictures logo. Well on the DVD version sad to say it is missing from the DVD, this is because Warner Bros. has released it and not Columbia Pictures. I admit I was upset to see it gone, but that is the only thing missing. All the songs and sceens are all still there. ""A Man Called Flintstone"" still has all the humor, action , and great songs it always had. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of it on DVD, grab it...it is truly worth it...even though I miss seeing Wilma as the Columbia Pictures logo(she is still there however on VHS)",1193270400,2,820,4.067901234567901
1842370,5,B00008F227,"I should know, I own it, and I live in Illinois. The bad part is that you only get the movie, no features or anything, but that is good enough for me right now.

Tha Man Called Flintstones is a gem, in my opinion one the greatest animated movies of all time. The entire show was great, and this movie captured the essence of the cartoon perfectly. It has Fred in a spy role, a farce of James Bond, and it is actually excellently well done/written. The songs are great, the movie is fantastic. I was thrilled that I was able to find this on DVD (as I have all 6 seasons of the show. Now I am awaiting the release of Flintstones a Christmas Carol and Flintstones Kids.) one of my all time favorate animated movies and show. A must for all Flintstones fans.",1171756800,5,754,4.2
1842371,5,B00008F227,"and the story plot.  I originally had this cartoon on VHS years ago.  My children and I enjoyed watching this cartoon together.  This was one program that we enjoyed as a family.  Much better than watching Pinky and the Brain or Spongebob.

It is amazing where family programming has gone.  My children are now in college and my one son thanks me for showing him what cartoons were popular when I was a kid and credits me for his creativity.",1163462400,,441,4.45
1842372,1,B00008F227,"This was released pretty much after the 6th and final season closed. The movie was pretty much where the families Flintstone and Rubble go on a European Vacation, and end up getting into trouble with enemy spies, and other hi-jinks. The movie itself is very boring, and the songs used were terrible; especially the one ""When I Grow Up""; the one where Pebbles sings. For a half hour show it was classic, but they stretched things too far when they released a almost 90 minute movie. Stick with the series from 1960-1966; anything else will be cheap, and horrible.",1147046400,5,562,4.686868686868687
1842373,5,B00008F227,"In the '60s, cartoons made for the big screen had a charm all their own (check out the Pink Panther movie shorts). For Hanna Barbera, they would include Hey There It's Yogi Bear, The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones, and A Man Called Flintstone. When the Peanuts specials made animated featurettes on TV a regular feature, other animated specials tended to seem like drawn-out shorts with musical interludes. Not this one. A Man Called Flintstone is all savvy and style, with eye-catching graphic design and memorable songs built around the '60s spy craze, yet stays true to the original look and feel of The Flintstones (unlike later films which reversion the cartoons).

Quite sad how it's all tied up in litigation, of course, but cross your fingers and it might come out on DVD, and if you see it used, take a chance with our man Flintstone.",1144886400,11,841,4.760273972602739

But for some reason, that has not stopped release of this DVD in Canada -- so go to Amazon.ca. I've ordered DVDs from them numerous times and the prices are usually reasonable (in fact, better, if the US Amazon is featuring the same selection as an import: compare prices on the DUE SOUTH box sets from Allied Entertainment).

1842407,1,B00008F227,"Warner Brothers has run into many legal snags in getting this movie to DVD home video.

1) There are many songs in the movie that Warner does not own the rights to.  When the movie was released to theaters it was a Columbia Picture and ColGems was their music rights division.

2) Apparently Hanna Barbera did not own all rights to this movie and their first movie ""HEY THERE IT'S YOGI BEAR"", they were partnered with Columbia Pictures.  When Turner Entertainment bought Hanna Barbera they did not get clear rights to these Hanna Barbera Movies.  Therefore when Turner sold his library to Warner Brothers, Warner didn't get clear rights to these Hanna Barbera Movies.

3) Yes, the DVDs were produced (without the Wilma Flintstone Columbia Logo) and withdrawn.

4) Warner will not give out any more information to be posted on the web, but the legal issues do not stop here.

5) The legal problems are so bad that YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ""THE MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE"" ON TELEVISION EITHER!

Keep those old VHS tapes & Laserdiscs in good shape, that is all you will have for some time until some agreements are reached.",1120780800,36,1119,4.6395939086294415

Maybe someone important also didn't like what Warner Brothers did and there might be an argument going on about it.  Kevin, I have a VHS copy of ""The Man Called Flintstone"" that show Wilma Flintstone in the Columbia Picture's Logo so you are right.  Because of that simple little change somebody on the top probably complain.  I am only speculating here so do not quote me.  Whatever the reason is I will be happy when WB or Columbia Pictures release this film on DVD.  I gave this one star for the same reason Bernard gave it a two stars.",1114387200,,660,4.404958677685951
1842409,2,B00008F227,"Nothing makes me madder except the idiots on the road that don't know where they are going or how they're getting there.  But what the heck is going on when they say that they're going to release a movie way back in October of 2004 and then keep pushing it back to the point of not releasing it at all until they decide.  I mean what could they possibly be using as an excuse for holding it back.  I just don't understand why it is so difficult to take the old movies that are truly great and classics and even if they aren't, and put them on a disc to sell.  I mean all the information can be uploaded to a computer to just download it or print it onto a disc whenever they want.  There is no worry about having to keep the film in a special room or even need to reproduce it a certain way in order to preserve it.  Once you have it onto the computer it stays in the same wonderful format you put it in when you first decided to install it to the computer.  They should be able to download every movie ever made and download it to a computer (it may have to be a big computer, but what the hell it will bring you lots of profits) and then reproduce the movie to a disc whenever anyone needs it.  This way you'll be able to produce even just one disc if that's all that is being requested, and not cost you any special money to have to mass produce it just to make a buck.

Am I the only one that can see this possibility.",1113782400,4,1422,3.9788732394366195
1842410,4,B00008F227,"I love this title so much that I almost hesitate to bring this up. Since Man Called Flintstone is now owned by Warner Brothers, they edited one of the biggest smiles from the opening titles. As the film was released theatrically by Columbia Pictures in 1966, Hanna Barbera took full advantage and replaced the woman with the torch in the Columbia Logo with Wilma holding a torch! I was surprised not to see that at the beginning, but understand. Why would Warners want to advertise Columbia on one of their properties?",1112140800,7,518,4.7032967032967035
1842411,5,B00008F227,"I for one am VERY excited about this release and was dissapointed when it was delayed (it was supposed to come out when season two did, but they delayed until season three).

I am a HUGE Flintstones and H-B fan, and I would like to correct a couple of errors in the previous reviewer's comments.

""Man Called Flintstone"" was NOT the first feature film from H-B. That honor goes to ""Hey There It's Yogi Bear"" released two years earlier and featuring animation that was slightly better than this venture.

Bea Benaderet had not passed away by the time this film was released. She left ""The Flintstones"" in 1964 because Betty wasn't getting enough attention in the series (she was absolutely right) and was replaced for the remaining two years of the series by Ms. Johnson. Ms. Johnson reprised the role for this film. Bea Benaderet died two years after this movie was released in 1968.",1108512000,,883,4.683870967741935
1842412,5,B00008F227,"You'd expect Hanna Barbera to pull out their big guns early in the race to release every frame ever filmed onto DVD, but instead they chose to release such question marks as Scooby Doo and the Boo Brothers first.  Well, we can only thank the powers that be that they decided to hold back on the collection of the Gary Coleman Show, becasue it means there's a spot in the schedule for H-B's first major motion picture, The Man Called Flintstone.

Featuring the original cast (Save for Gerry Johnson as Betty; Bea Benaderet had already passed on by this time) and semi-regular Harvey Korman (blessedly NOT as the Great Gazoo), the film is rife with classic filmic cliches like the person of importance that just happens to resemble a character on the show (a plot that was used in the series at least three times, a probable record) a few moments of mistaken identity, and all wrapped in a spy plot to take advantage of the James Bond craze.

Some of the best songs that were ever written for a Hanna-Barbera release, (okay, I can live without ""Tickle Toddle"") and some great art design make this a can't miss part of the Flintstone canon.

If you don't blink you'll see one of the weirdest product placements in history.  Apparently, Qantas airways has been in business since prehistoric times, because that's the airline Fred and Co travel on to Eurock!
