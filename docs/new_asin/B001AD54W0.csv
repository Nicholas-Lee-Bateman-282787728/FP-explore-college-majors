8277067,5,B001AD54W0,"Too Late for Tears, 1949 film

This was based on a `Saturday Evening Post' serial. It begins with a view from a hill overlooking a city in the dark (Los Angeles). A car drives along the highway, the couple in it argues. Another car tosses a satchel into their car. Then they are chased by another car. Is a bag of money good luck or a curse? Will they hide it or turn it in to the police? Will Jane spend some? Then a detective shows up to search their apartment. There is a surprise here! Does Jan have a character flaw? Can money buy ""peace of mind""? Danny shows up again for his cash. Will Jane make a deal? Will she play fair? Was that a mistake? ""You're quite a gal."" Will their plot be successful? Jane takes Danny for a ride, but he jumps out and runs away.

Alan's sister checks their apartment and finds the claim ticket. An old war buddy of Alan's shows up. Katherine talks to him. What happened to Alan? Would he take his Army gun with him? Lt. Breech from Homicide shows up. Was there another woman? Alan's car was found near the Mexican border. Jane is curious about Don Blake. Is Katherine a threat to Jane? Danny doesn't like this, but he has no choice. Don and Katherine investigate Alan's disappearance. ""That explains everything."" Finally there is a meeting that causes a crisis for Don Blake. Jane goes to recover the satchel and keeps her bargain. ""Its all ours."" Danny tells how he got the money - blackmail!

Jane has one more trick up her sleeve. The police find Danny but he won't talk. We learn that dragging a lake has a lot of paperwork. Jane leaves California for Mexico. Don Blake shows up, we learn more about him. He is a killjoy. At the end we learn who Don Blake really is. Jane refuses to come quietly and so she is not taken back to America.

The unexpected plot twists will keep you surprised. This story reminds me of ""Double Indemnity"". ""Jane Petrie"" is the most vicious villainess since ""Phyllis Nirdlinger"". One flaw in this story is that Jane did not see a family resemblance in Don Blanchard. Jane's first husband was Bob Blanchard.",1474070400,,2074,4.407310704960835

Dubs are from unrestored film stock, thus quality varies with source material condition. None are pristine, yet none are so degraded as to be unviewable. Some of their transfers are in fact quite decent.

In the late 1940s and early '50s the screen's greatest femme fatale just may have been Lizabeth Scott, and TOO LATE FOR TEARS (1949) is a perfect example of Scott at her villainous best.

Typical of film noir, the story opens at night. Jane Palmer (Scott) and husband Alan (Arthur Kennedy) are on an evening drive in their light colored convertible when an object is tossed into their coupe's back seat from a passing car. A quick look by Alan reveals a large leather satchel. Almost immediately we see the gears in Jane's evil little brain start to whirl, propelled by GREED.

An immediate complication is there's another convertible on their tail, its lights flashing. This must be the vehicle that the wayward grip was intended for. Jane zig-zags wildly over the road and manages to lose their pursuer. Alan takes the wheel and back in Los Angeles they're flagged down by a motorcycle cop. Naturally both are nervous and the officer senses this as he eyes the two carefully. Jane has the glove compartment open and she stares at the handgun inside it. Alan knows what Jane's thinking, and it's at this point that he should've cut and run. The cop hands him a citation for turning without a signal and leaves. Alan asks Jane just what she had considerded doing and she plays dumb.

In this fast-moving story, the valise's owner shows up at the Palmer apartment while Alan's at work. Danny Fuller (Dan Duryea) is your standard tough-talking thug in flashy suit and loud bow tie. He wants his money and nothing Jane can say will convince him that she and Alan don't have it. Alan wants to turn the cash over to the police anyway, so Jane makes a quick decision to throw in with Danny just long enough to get both he and Alan out of the way.

Being a widow is nothing new to Jane, for her first husband, a man of some wealth, died of an apparent suicide. It looks like there'll be more ""suicides"" before this show is over.

It's a very satsfying crime movie, filmed at REPUBLIC Studios, that also features Don DeFore, Kristine Miller and Barry Kelley. BTW, if that uncredited boat attendant at the lakeside concession looks familiar, that's because he's former Dead End Kid gang leader Billy Halop. Other cameos include Denver Pyle (Youth at Union Station) and future Head Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd (Second Car Thief).

Directed by former cinematographer and special effects man Byron Haskin, TOO LATE FOR TEARS is currently rated a strong 7.3 at IMDb.",1399075200,,2803,4.743326488706366
8277071,2,B001AD54W0,"While the movie is a nice, slightly absurd little noir (3-plus stars), Sinister's print is the worst I've seen.  Now in fairness to the company they, unlike some of their grey-market competitors, do not make claims to have re-mastered anything and their prices are more reasonable.  Nonetheless, this version is taken from a source riddled with defects (cleanest public-domain print I've encountered is that used by St. Clair Vision).",1296000000,6,434,5.27536231884058
8277072,5,B001AD54W0,"I am a fan of Dan Duryea and will watch anything with him in it. So, I came across TOO LATE FOR TEARS and was newly introduced to Lizabeth Scott. The pairing of Duryea and Scott in this film is magic.  Lizabeth Scott has to be the ultimate femme fatale, or at least in this film. It is worth watching just for the dialog between Scott and Duryea alone. There are also good performances by Arthur Kennedy as Lizabeth Scott's hen-pecked husband and Don Defore, as the brother of Lizabeth Scott's deceased husband prior to Arthur Kennedy.

This is one of the best film noir's I've seen.  The plot moves along at a good clip and you certainly will not be bored.",1252540800,,657,4.368852459016393
8277073,4,B001AD54W0,"Lizabeth Scott as Janie, whose hunger for money and all it can bring her, destroys every relationship in her life and compels her to murder, is so good you can't take your eyes off her. Re-released later under the name ""Killer Bait,"" this 1949 picture leaves up to both its titles. One of the quintessential films noir. With a  greenish tint that goes surprisingly well and is easy on the eyes, the print quality is noticeably better than that of the Alpha Video version and there aren't the occasional missing frames, which justifies the additional cash layout.",1222041600,8,562,4.793814432989691
