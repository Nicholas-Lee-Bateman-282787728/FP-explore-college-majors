2500219,1,B000E6ESBW,"This program fails in all departments.  Obviously McEntire has a huge fan base who will support her in anything she does, even mediocre junk like this.  I agree with the poster below about the ""Happy Pills"" episode.  It isn't right to make fun of people who take anti-depressants.  And it isn't right for this program to poke fun at the dysfunctionalism of society either.",1139443200,3,372,4.765625
2500220,1,B000E6ESBW,"Season Three of this stupid sitcom is probably the worst yet.  My sisters like it but I find it socially and morally degrading.  I'm tired of programs like this which continually choose to glorify family dysfunctionalism to the point where it has become the norm in today's society.  Its a shame that America has come to this.  The worst episode of the lot here is the one called ""Happy Pills"".  Making fun of people who take anti-depressants is cruel, offensive and demeaning.  But then this program is offensive and demeaning so why should I expect anything less.",1139097600,4,565,4.77319587628866

2500368,5,B000E6ESBW,"By season 3 of the sitcom Reba, I was fully on board.  This show was always funny while still managing to tackle some serious subjects.  I never wanted to miss an episode.

The premise doesn't sound as funny as it is.  Reba McEntire plays Reba Hart, a mom to three kids whose life falls apart in season one when her husband Brock (Christopher Rich) announces that he's divorcing her to marry his pregnant dental hygienist Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman).  Meanwhile, Reba's eldest Cheyenne (JoAnna Garcia) became a teenage mother and married her boyfriend Van (Steve Howey).  As of season 3, this young couple are still living with Reba.  In season 3, middle daughter Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) enters high school and the youngest Jake (Mitch Holleman) is now 9.

As the season opens, Kyra announces the decision she's made, which left us hanging at the end of season 2.  She is going to move in with her dad and Barbra Jean, who have just moved two doors down from Reba.  This complicates the parenting as the rules between the two houses really conflict.

Meanwhile, Van drops out of college to join an area football team and shaves his head in a moment of team bonding, and Cheyenne decides on a major in college, something Reba thinks she can't handle.  Reba and Brock enter a 5K race and compete against each other.  Barbra Jean freaks out when she learns that someone died in their new house.  And Brock begins to face up to his life as he thinks about selling his dental practice to play golf professionally and starts seeing a therapist.

Yes, even those episodes dealing with Brock's depression are funny, which is a tribute to the great writing on the show.  They find that perfect balance between jokes and laughs while still managing to treat these subjects seriously.  It's a very fine line, and they walk it perfectly.  Okay, so maybe those episodes aren't as funny as some of the others, but they do still have their classic moments.

Even when this show was doing what would become a very special episode on any other show is still hilarious.  The case in point this season is ""Calling the Pot Brock"" which deals with the subject of marijuana.  It's one of my favorite episodes of the season because it is so funny.

Of course, for this to work, the acting has to rise to the level of the scripts, and it does that every week.  I've never seen Reba McEntire in anything else, and I didn't think I'd like the show because I figured she couldn't act.  Wrong!  She's terrific and a great comedian.  By this point, the entire cast knows their characters, so they are able to milk their lines for every possible emotion and make it seem effortless.  There's not a weak performance in the bunch.  My favorite still has to be Scarlett Pomers who plays the sarcastic Kyra to perfection.  She is an absolute joy to watch.

Season 3 consisted of 22 episodes, including the double length premier, and they are all here on 3 double sided discs in their native full frame and stereo sound.  This is the last season where we got any extras.  There are commentaries on about half a dozen episodes by some combination of the executive producers and actors.  When it's just the actors, it's not that interesting, but when the producers get in on the act, we get some interesting information.  ""Matters of the Hart"" is a 17 minute look at the season with interviews with the actors and producers about it.  Finally, ""Melissa's Backstage Diary"" finds Melissa Peterman backstage finding out what some of the many crew members do.  It's fun at times and a bit long at others.

This show continues to mine the ordinary and even the serious for truly laugh out loud moments.  I've seen these episodes before, and I still found myself laughing hard at them.  Season 3 of Reba is perfect for anyone who loves a good sitcom.",1431734400,,3809,4.611607142857143

2500424,5,B000E6ESBW,"Reba is a very cute comedy based on the perils of Reba Hart, a mother of three in the throes of a divorce from her ex-husband, Brock, who is a dentist involved with quite a ditzy, but sometimes endearing hygenist. As if the divorce was not enough to handle, Reba must also endure the issues that come with her eldest daughter who is pregnant and still in high school. While the situation would have most fall to their knees, Reba seems to be able to manage and make things work better than most. Barbara Jean, however, can make life very difficult and I am amazed at Reba's composure when dealing with this very absurd character. Season 1 is full of laughs along with Season 2. However, as the series progresses, it becomes less entertaining and more annoying due to the choices made and the children who seem to get left in the background as Cheyenne is always front and center and the one who seems to get all the attention from Reba.",1376611200,,936,4.4476744186046515

2500496,5,B000E6ESBW,"Season 3 of REBA is a miraculous TV-watching experience.  This may be one of the best seasons of the series, coming from a person who has seen almost every REBA episode.  The acting and writing in this season is pin-point, and while Season 1 establishes the plot and Season 4 introduces a lot of the drama, Season 3 is REBA at its comedic best.

Everyone knows that there are so many run-of-the-mill comedy series on TV, and you can't imagine how much of a thrill it is when a series of this originality and hilarity comes along.  REBA, for those of you who don't know, stars singer Reba McEntire as a woman who's husband Brock (Chritopher Rich) left her for ditzy, heart-in-the-right-place Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman).  Also, Reba's daughter Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia) and her husband Van (Steve Howey) were pregnant as teenagers, and younger kids Kyra (Scarlett Pompers) and Jake (Mitch Holleman) oftentimes get stuck in the middle.  However, all of that happened in Season 1.  This third season of REBA comes at a time when the family has just started to function at a level that is just barely functional, but before the end of the season, almost everything falls apart again.

The acting ranges from near-perfect to perfect in every episode, and the talented cast, both young and old, make the series ten times funnier than it would be on paper alone.  Delivery is almost everything, and this cast has extraordinary chemistry.  The script is always witty and smart, and every episode will make you laugh out loud, as well as warm your heart.

The DVD release is above average, but not great.  The special features are minimal, but the picture quality is exceptional.  All in all, Season 3 of REBA is a must-own for fans of the series, die-hard and casual.  And, for anyone looking for a place to start, it might be a good sample.",1279584000,,1835,4.7115987460815045
2500497,5,B000E6ESBW,"This is a hilarious sitcom. The plot features Reba, a divorced mom with three kids, who has to put up with them, her son-in-law, ex-husband, and his new wife,  Barbara-Jean, the big blonde ditz. They get into all sorts of crazy situations, usually involving family fights, but sometimes wandering into the truly bizarre (they even managed a tasteful comedy about Hurricane Katrina). The dialogue is witty, the actors have perfect timing, and the plots are entertaining. Barbara-Jean, steals most of the shows, but all of the characters have their moments. If you want to laugh, I highly recommend renting this.",1278979200,,610,5.1

2500555,5,B000E6ESBW,"Reba McEntire stars as Reba Hart, a mother of three whose husband Brock (Christopher Rich) has recently left her for his pregnant dental assistant. Meanwhile, another blow struck as Reba discovered her 17-year-old daughter Cheyanne was also expecting.

Now, the third year focuses upon teenage parents Cheyanne (Joanna Garcia) and Van (Steve Howey), who live in Reba's house with their baby daughter Elizabeth. The two are truly unequipped for the real world, and constantly come up against blows from the workforce and college. After a great deal of heartache, Cheyanne is settling down in her role as mom and student, while Van's been recruited by professional football.

There's also little Henry, the son of Brock and Barbra Jean. While Reba would love to forget the very existence of the baby -- as well as his clueless, ditzy mother -- for some inane reason Barbra Jean is determined to become her new best friend.

Meanwhile, Brock's abruptly decided he would rather be a professional golfer than a dentist, and smart, sarcastic middle child Kyra (Scarlett Pomers) acts out from the pressures of being the only sane person around. After moving out of her mother's home at the end of Season 2, she was certain things would get better...but Kyra never realized that life with her dad and Barbra Jean carries its own problems.

What's a woman to do? Most in Reba's situation would fall apart, but not her. Even when things are at their darkest, Reba's wit allows her to laugh and see the good -- though in no way is her character, or the show, sappy or sentimental. Rather, the imperfect Hart family strives to live each day to the fullest, making the best of each day however they can.

Description:

First Reba Hart (Reba McEntire) had to get used to the fact that her husband of twenty years left her to marry his young dental assistant. Now she has to face the fact that her youngest daughter wants to go live with her ex-husband and his new wife! Hurt and angry, Reba struggles to accept her daughter's decision. But when her son also starts spending more time at his father's house, Reba fears she's losing her whole family. Although with her ex-husband's new wife constantly showing up asking for advice, Reba soon realizes that losing family is the last thing she needs to worry about!",1181088000,,733,4.630769230769231

The acting, timing, and comedy are superb.  Van is a hoot.  Reba Hart is priceless.  Barbara Jean makes your eyes water, she's so funny.  An unlikely story line, but it WORKS.  You know, I said if you love Reba, you must have this.  This actually made me love Reba.  I'm a new Reba fan.  In the rare moments that she sings, it's always a believable part of the story line, AND WHAT A TREAT.  Boy does she have some pipes!",1171324800,4,565,4.08256880733945

To all the American Family folks who were obviously advised by their leader to post en masse negative comments... have you ever actually watched the show. Reba tries to promote right from wrong. She also advocates love & compassion & understanding for her kids.",1168041600,,422,4.48051948051948

2500776,5,B000E6ESBW,"This comedy is fantastic, it is funny and it deals with real life issues in a clean manner.  I disagree with many other reviewers that it is indecent.  I don't quite understand how Friends, Will and Grace, etc. can be accepted by society as quality television, and some of these same people who watch those shows have issues with Reba.  At least on Reba, there are morals given for mixed-up situations.  Also, Reba is not only a fantastic country music singer, but she is also a fantastic actress.  She got such rave reviews on Broadway for her Annie Get Your Gun performance that a few years after her performance, a new award was created for the best replacement in a Broadway play.  This year they are having trouble finding a candidate for that reward, it seems none of the replacements on Broadway have the acting prowess that Reba did.  Also, initially James Cameron wanted Reba McEntire to play Molly Brown in Titanic, but because of her touring schedule, she was unable to do it.  Anyone who thinks Reba isn't a good actress ought to watch Reba again.  They must have missed something the first time.  Additionally, Reba is well-written, the other actors are also fantastic, and the Reba team have said themselves how they try to keep it a family show.  So, watch Reba Season 3 and enjoy!",1148428800,16,1296,4.640350877192983

In some episodes she does but in most she just makes everyone else look bad.  She's a good singer of ""real country music"" (something she used to do a long time ago) but she is a lousy, stinkin' actress.",1145232000,2,363,4.3088235294117645

To those who feel the show is only an advocate for teen pregnancy and divorce i feel that that is extremely narrowminded and it is because of those people that make shows like this one necessary.  It initiates discussion and debate and makes sure that people know that these situations exist even without the show.  So even if the show was to be cancelled these issues would still be there.  It makes people going through situations like the ones portrayed that they are not alone.  Thank you REBA and The WB for bringing a show like this to tv, it is nice to see a show that emulates what is going on in the 21st Century.

This show is a mockery of the ""family unit"" and Reba fans justify this by stating that even though the family is dysfunctional all is well and dandy with a bow on top.  So Divorce is not a dirty word, teen pregnancy can be advocated and adultery is par for the course in today's society.  Have at it folks...if it feels good, do it!  You're gonna be supported in every way.  Enough with the ""Leave it to Beaver"", ""Waltons"" ""Little House"" and ""Brady Bunch"" ideals.  Get with the program.

While another review places the blame of disfunction on the show, I see it as a real picture of what alot of families look like today, most of them being blended by divorce. Unlike the review I read on here, I hardly see it as an aproval for divorce or teen pregnancy but reality of situations our young people and famlies face today and ways we can choose to deal with it. Any body that watches the show knows that the none of the them have been through a cake walk but they choose to love on another and make the best of their journey.",1144972800,9,666,4.091603053435114

My daughter thinks its o.k. to have premarital sex because she thinks I'll support her the way Reba supports her daughter and her husband.  Not only that but my daughter also thinks that divorce is cool because B.J. is cool.  I've had to really put my foot down and prevent my family from watching this modicum of dandy dysfunctionalism!

All of Warner Bros. programming is the same.  This sitcom is no different than the rest.  Its a harmless show but I for one will NOT be buying Season Three. Why?

2500933,1,B000E6ESBW,"I am not trouncing the series but I am trouncing its star.  This redheaded egomaniac thinks she can do no wrong.  She's surrounded by good capable actors and scripts that go from competent (good) to mediocre (fair) to downright bad!  Reba McEntire gives new meaning to the words ""bad acting"".  She hollers her lines as if her life depended on it which throws the timing off the comedy.  This has become more and more evident with each succeeding season.  The first two seasons should have given her time to hone her acting skills but it is all too evident that she is going to do things ""HER"" way or its the ""HIGHWAY"".  But that is a control freak for you.  Its such a shame because the series itself does have possibilities.  I won't go so far as to say its degrading and immoral.  On the contrary its very ""preachy"" and McEntire comes off as a self-righteous hippocrite.  Advice:  Stick with programs like ""The Waltons"" and ""Little House on the Prairie"".  I have had it with this country music ???? ""diva"" thinking she owns the planet!!",1140480000,4,1038,4.545945945945946

The relationship between Reba and Brock still being able to be there for each other and for their children all the time even after their DIVORCE is a lesson a lot of us could learn today. They are not the perfect family but through their ups and downs they all still find a way to come together and LOVE each other no matter what the circumstance is, true UNCONDITIONAL LOVE , if that is not MORAL then I don't know what is. This is a GREAT show and just gets better with each season, I'm looking forward to buying season three and all others as they come out. This is in my opinion THE BEST SHOW ON T.V. right now!!!!!

Such is not the case with this plodding, mish-mash of rejected Rosanne scripts called ""Reba"". It is fine that it shows a family sticking together but the end does not justify the means.  Apparently Reba McEntire wants to think she can top Lucille Ball!!  But at least Lucy's shows were not offensive to anyone.  I am a manager at a Media Play so I get to watch newly released DVD sets and movies to recommend on our displays.

This show does everything in perfect taste and I hope it continues on for 10 seasons. Purschase this DVD along with all the other seasons.
