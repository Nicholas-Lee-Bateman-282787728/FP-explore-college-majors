3956844,2,B002N5N4K8,Not as good as other seasons. No where near as fun to watch and lacking in creativity.,1271289600,5,86,4.117647058823529
3956845,3,B002N5N4K8,"I have all seasons of project runway on dvd. I cannot watch the program live, since I live in Germany. So I have to wait until the dvd is out. Really, this one looks like they have run out of money! No extras? No trips to Paris or something like that? Is the budget smaller than it was before? And where was Michael Corrs all the time and what does Lindsay Lohan know about fashion??
It was still fun to watch, but my favourite seasons are still the second and the third one ;-)",1270684800,12,478,4.095744680851064

3956847,3,B002N5N4K8,"I am a big fan of ""Project Runway"". I pre-ordered the season 6 and finished the whole season in 3 days.  It was pretty clear who would be the final 3 from the beginning. But I was still kinda surprised who was out for some episodes. There are some interesting challenges but I have to say I was left uninspired... Another disappointment is that there is no bonus features.. So far my favorite season is still season4. I could watch season 4 over and over again!",1267315200,2,461,4.3604651162790695
3956848,2,B002N5N4K8,"I'm a HUGE Project Runway fan and have every other season available on DVD but I will not be purchasing this one.  The move to Los Angeles was incongruous with the industry (sorry LA will NEVER outpace New York as the fashion capital of the USA) and the judging suffered tremendously by the frequent absences of 2/3 of the judging ""troika"" of Heidi Klum, Nina Garcia and Michael Kors.  While there were some interesting choices for judges (Christina Aguilera) there were mostly some WTF judges (Lindsay Lohen, REALLY??) who did not contribute well to the judging process.  The contestants in particular were unevenly ""talented"" and it was clear from the beginning who would win.  Finally the challenges themselves were odd this season as well.  I watched it but mostly in the hopes that it would get interesting and exciting.  Seeing Tim Gunn in flip flops on the beach was as exciting as it got I'm afraid.  Buy this only if you are a die hard fan and purist who must have all seasons.",1264723200,45,986,4.664739884393064

When my grandkids started saying moooowah for their greetings I became curious, and the family explained the mother watching and that sound came through to the kid's ears.  Now it is a family greeting all around and we love Heidi Klum.  The sewing patterns, the tailoring, the individuals making their mark, the models and judges.....all just make for an excellent ""reality"" show.  Excellent production continues.",1366156800,,448,5.267605633802817
3956885,3,B002N5N4K8,This is my least favorite season basically because its in LA. Nina and Michael are often absent from the runway and there are always random substitution judges.,1365638400,,160,4.962962962962963
3956886,2,B002N5N4K8,"I agree with others that this season is not the best example of Project Runway.  Overall, the contestants were weak, and this season's winner would likely not have won against most of the show's stronger contestants.  The guest judges were a joke (who considers Christina Aguilera or Lindsay Lohan fashion experts other than hookers?) and I got pretty sick of Irina's interviews saying how much more talented she is than everyone else.",1351555200,,435,5.027777777777778
3956887,5,B002N5N4K8,"I am hooked on this show, what can I say.  It's amazing the creations these designers can bring to life, and with a little bit of drama too...who wouldn't like that?",1349136000,,165,4.32258064516129
3956888,5,B002N5N4K8,"I don't sew, but I adore this show!

Each season begins with approximately 12-16 up-and-coming fashion designers selected to compete for the opportunity to design a show for Fashion Week in Bryant Park of New York City.  Each episode introduces a new challenge for the designers in which they have minimal time to sketch and purchase materials for the challenge, always accomplished under significant time restraints.  The challenges themselves are often very interesting, such as the challenge to create clothing from non-traditional materials (e.g. items from a pet store, flowers, or items reconstructed from their own pajamas).

In addition to the challenges, the designers themselves bring a lot of color and character to the show.  The mentor, Tim Gunn, is terrific at encouraging the designers to to do their best with his trademark ""Make It Work, Designers!""  And if that isn't enough, the judges (Michael Kors and Nina Garcia) offer thoughful critiques.  And then there is the third judge and show host, Heidi Klum, who offers valuable input and something pretty to look at.

But at the core of it all is the fashion.  It is really interesting to watch the clothes come to life in each challenge, culminating in a runway show.

If you like fashion, you'll love Project Runway!",1341705600,,1285,5.04739336492891
3956919,2,B002N5N4K8,"Compared to Seasons 1-5, this one is a snooze fest. LA made it hard for Michael Kors and Nina Garcia to be present on a consistent basis; thus I felt that intimate connection that develops between the designers and judges over the entire season as you'd see in the previous seasons was sorely missing. Also, be it uninteresting personalities, as a viewer, it was hard to develop a bond to the designers and by Fashion week, I was so bored that I was just wishing it to end so I can get on with Season 7 and hopefully see some improvements.

Also, the role of the models were reduced. The model paired with the losing designer was automatically eliminated and removed the welcome suspense of the model selection after each win. I feel like we barely got to know the models at all; they just felt like mannequins sadly. It'd be nice to see a bit more model story/drama mixed into the show - perhaps not to the extent of Morgan from Season 1 to the detriment of the designers but in a way that it spices up the show.

As others have pointed out, this one is the worst out of the bunch (thus far). Seasons 1-5 were more interesting. You can skip this one and really not miss anything.

Side note: I wish they'd bring back the designer auditions as the first episode of the show. They stopped doing that from Season 4. Those audition footages were my favorite things about the show, much like the comical American Idol audition footages. It's fun to see the crazy, wacky, misguided designer hopefuls, and for the chosen designers, as a viewer, I feel more connected to them from the get go b/c we've seen a bit of their lives, hopes, and dreams already.",1325980800,2,1648,4.432343234323432
3956920,4,B002N5N4K8,"I don't quite get the vitriolic response to this season. While I agree that the lamest contestants were really lame and the winners were less dynamic than usual, it was still a fun show and as engaging as always. I also liked the variety of guest judges, including designers like Azria and Hilfiger - whose ready to wear I've actually bought. The inclusion of the type of stars who actually buy and parade around in these clothes added further interest. Putting this season down just because it was shot in L.A. seems like sheer coastal snobbery. The inspirations, from the red carpet to the Getty, were just as valid and interesting as back east. If you're a fan of the show, you'll want to see this season too.",1310083200,7,712,4.5703125
3956921,2,B002N5N4K8,"This is really a season to skip. Or, if you love Project Runway as much as I do, watch it once and then never again, while complaining for the rest of forever of how much it dissapointed.

That's a key word: dissapointed. It's not terrible, I don't think PR would be because of it's basic premise. But it is lacking almost everything good PR has ever done. Judges, NYC, talented people, people you like (preferably both)...All those were missing.

The winner was so unsatisfying. Truly. SPOILERS----------

It's just, whenever I see her, I grimace. She's annoying. She's conceited but doesn't even acknowledge it the way Gretchen of PR 8, also annoying, did. Irina did an all black collection and the judges ate it up?? They get touchy about monochromatic stuff when it's just one outfit coming from a challange. Her stuff was just uninteresting, her growth on the show nonexistent, and you are left with a feeling of 'meh.'

You do have to give credit through to the show runners, because after this season they hightail it back to NYC and get Michael and Nina back. They know they went through a crappy season, we know it, so now we can quietly move on to future, good, talented, emotionally satisfying seasons.",1307059200,3,1213,4.734597156398104
3956922,3,B002N5N4K8,This show is horrible. DVD plays as it supposed to.,1302220800,,51,4.2
3956923,4,B002N5N4K8,"This was the first entire season of project runway that I was able to see, as we had just gotten cable for the first time--so I am unable to compare this season with the previous ones.  My first viewing of Project Runway was, nevertheless, a revelation.  If somebody were to have told me a few years ago that one of my favorite shows (if not my favorite) would be a fashion design competition, I would have thought that this person was insane!  My wife, an artistic fan of Vogue patterns from way back, had learned about PR from her sister, and so she started watching it regularly as soon as we got cable.  I was naturally often present while she was watching, and before I knew it I was completely hooked!

The whole thing of how the designers have to quickly whip something up while working under the often crazy constraints that are placed on them reminds me of solving the complex engineering problems with which I am familiar.  The results are often startling.  Some outfits are so terrible that I imagine that even I could have come up with something better.  Other creations are brilliant beyond anything that I would even have thought possible.  From my point of view (that of a straight guy born in the fifties midst visions of Marilyn Monroe) most of the models are incredibly skinny--and their faces often very angular.  What the designers are able to do in the way of transforming these young models is nothing short of incredible.  The draping of the fabric is often seen to accent the figures of these young women to the point where they could actually give the screen sirens of my youth a run for their money.  The hair and makeup are seen to bring softness and light to their faces as well.  I see now that these young woman are the proper tabula rasa upon which the designers might best work their magic.

I also found myself entertained by the personalities of the regulars on the show.  Heidi's diction is amusing for me.  Her German accent laced with odd African/Southern American elements (I guess from Heidi's husband) like ""little"" pronounced as ""li'l"" (that is, the t's in the word replaced by a glottal stop) is amusing in and of itself.  Tim is so nurturing and compassionate in his work with the designers--what a nice guy!  Every time he sends the looser of the competition back to the work room to clean up his/her space he makes it sound that he is reluctantly sending his own precious child off to college!  Michael Kors is incredibly witty--though I would hate to be on the receiving end of his numerous barbs!

I can see, however, after having viewed seasons seven and eight that this season might not have been the best.  I liked Carol Hannah and Althea's designs in the final competition better than Irina's.  Although I can see that Irina's collection was more coherent, her parade of warrior women just didn't do it for me!",1300492800,2,2861,4.590551181102362
3956924,1,B002N5N4K8,"I love Project Runway, but this season made me want to tear my hair out.  The judging was reprehensible and the talent only slightly better (especially since the more interesting characters tended to be booted out earliest.) I never thought I would miss seeing Nina Garcia and Michael Kors on every episode, but their absence was really felt.  For some reason, those who had creativity but took the design a tiny bit too far were nearly always kicked off over those who performed consistently mediocre. Was it because of the recession that everyone suddenly felt conservative and not willing to go out on a limb??  Sigh.  Not what I had come to expect from Project Runway.",1295395200,4,672,4.767241379310345
3956925,3,B002N5N4K8,"The Show is great, I was really looking forward to owning another season. However when I got the DVD the 3rd disc in the set didn't work. It was skipping and freezing. Amazon's customer service was amazing and they replaced it right away. Unfortunately the replacement had the same problem. Returned it for a refund but was still impressed with the company and the product so I am giving it a 3 star.",1280102400,,400,4.493150684931507

But don't waste your money on season 6. it left so much out of the dvd.

3956928,1,B002N5N4K8,Don't waste your money on this season. It was obvious from the first few shows who would be the winner.
