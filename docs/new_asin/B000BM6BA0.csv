8088710,5,B000BM6BA0,"This dvd was taped in a small club in Amsterdam. Angie Stone was in good voice. She seems like she was having a great time. She had the audience in the palm of her hands once she stepped on the stage. Her set list was also great for a fan like me. Check out her rendition of Stay for a While ft Boris. This was one of the highlights of the dvd. I must have watched it a million times and it feels like I'm watching it for the first time everytime.
